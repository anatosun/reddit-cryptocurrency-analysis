In this section, we investigate the four data models we have designed. The main question that we tried to answer by modeling our data is what an edge should represent. Naturally, when an user opens some post on Reddit, they might start reading the first comment. If it doesn't catch their attention, they read the second top comment. They even might continue reading the reply tree to that comment. The nature of this is that the replies are very often context based. To understand the comment of depth 3, you might need to also have read the comments of depth 2 or 1. For this reason we assume that if an user replies to some comment, they have a connection to all the people in that chain of comments. We consequently opted for four different data models: the Unique Cartesian Link, the Deep Link, the Next Link and finally the Deep Link No Merge model. In the following subsections, we present subsequently these four models.

\subsection{Unique Cartesian Link}
The Unique Cartesian Link model is probably the most natural way to create an undirected graph from our data. The main concept is the following. Every user that commented on a post get linked together in a complete graph with edge weight 1. If there is already an edge between two users, the weight of the edge gets increased by 1. This creates an enormously large graph compared to our other data models. This makes computation on the graph very difficult and slow. Also, it doesn't really represent our idea of a relationship between two users. That's why we opted for other models.

\subsection{Deep Link}
In the Deep Link model, we connect each user to the original poster (OP) and to all users who replied to the user's comment. The edges get a weight depending on the depth of the comment and the achieved upvote score. If there is already an edge between the two users, the weight gets increased. This is a directed graph. See Figure \ref{fig:graphmodel} and the corresponding table.

\begin{tabular}{l}
User 0 (OP, depth=1, score=30)  \\
\hline
\hspace{1cm} User 1 (d=1, s=10)              \\
\hline
\hspace{2cm} User 2 (d=2, s=10)            \\
\hline
\hspace{2cm} User 3 (d=2, s=2)             \\
\hline
\hspace{1cm} User 4 (d=1, s=5)             \\
\hline
\hspace{1cm} User 5 (d=1, s=3)             \\
\hline
\hspace{2cm} User 6 (d=2, s=2)             \\
\hline
\hspace{3cm} User 3 (d=3, s=1)             \\
\hline
\hspace{2cm} User  7 (d=2, s=1)            \\
\hspace{6.5cm}
\end{tabular}

% 		- User 2 (d=2, s=10)
% 		- User 3 (d=2, s=2)
% 	- User 4 (d=1, s=5)
% 	- User 5 (d=1, s=3)
% 		- User 6 (d=2, s=2)
% 			- User 3 (d=3, s=1)
% 		-User  7 (d=2, s=1)

\subsection{Next Link}
Regarding the Next Link model it is highly similar to the Deep Link one, except that we only connect each user to the OP and the immediate users who commented directly on the user's comment. Thus the blue link in Figure \ref{fig:graphmodel} are missing in this data model. This model keeps the direction of the graph.

\subsection{Deep Link No Merge}
The Deep Link No Merge is pretty similar to the Deep Link one but here we don't merge the weights and allow multiple edges from one user to another. Thus, it gives rise to a directed multigraph. We found that this approach has still lots of information but is not too expensive to compute. Consequently, this is the privileged model for the analysis in the next section.
