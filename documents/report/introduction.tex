Since the rise of cryptocurrencies, a lot of research have attempted to predict their price rates \cite{kooPredictionBitcoinPrice2021,coccoPredictionsBitcoinPrices2021,liMultiwindowBitcoinPrice2021}. Due to the transparency of cryptocurrency transactions, researchers have considered using transaction information such as overall trends and cyclical changes to predict cryptocurrency prices \cite{liCrossCryptocurrencyRelationship2022}.

In this project, we attempt to find a link between the activity in cryptocurrency subreddits and the price of Bitcoin. For that purpose, we scraped data directly from said subreddits, structured data in a network architecture and performed several analysis such as PageRank, Louvain community detection and correlation analysis.

This report is structured the following way. Firstly, we discuss the scraping methodology we used, secondly the data models we tried and considered for the analysis and thirdly we outline the analysis of our model. As a closing word, we highlight trials and errors during this project.
