In conclusion, during this work we have collected data from 10 cryptocurrency-related subreddits and have performed analysis on them. We first have modeled the data and have concluded that the one that best fits our need was the Deep Link No Merge model. We pursued with the analysis and proved that our data followed a Power Law distribution. With help of PageRank, we showed that the discussion on these subreddits tend to have a lasting interest. Furthermore, with Louvain, we showed that each community detected spread over multiple subreddits. However, the majority of each community has a foothold in one unique subreddit. Correlation between subreddits activity and Bitcoin price movement was later revealed with a value of $-0.85$. We also found that the more days were analysed the better results it yielded. All in all, the results that were produced in this work are consistent with related ones. Finally, a dedicated work could be done on this subject to further discover relations and relevant results.
