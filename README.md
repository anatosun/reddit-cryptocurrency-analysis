# Social Media Analytics

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to perform sentimental analysis (SA) in real time
on cryptocurrencies. For that purpose, Twitter is taken as a network source
both to discover communities centered around cryptocurrencies and to retrieve
text data for SA itself. Influencer accounts (e.g. @Bitcoin, @ethereum,
@BTCTN,etc.) as well as hashtags are taken as starting points to build the
network and the analysis. SA would be done both inside and outside communities
to deviate correlation and interesting results. Furthermore, SA would be
multidimensional with respect to time, so that it could be compared with
cryptocurrencies' rates. Consequently, the end result would most likely be the
currencies' rates with key points (e.g. extrema) that could reveal both SA (in-
and outside communities).
