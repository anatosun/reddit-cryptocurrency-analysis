In this section we pursue with the analysis of data scrapped on several cryptocurrency subreddits. More precisely, we use social media analytics on the network that we built in the previous section. Firstly, we investigate if our network follows a power law distribution as it should. Secondly, we discuss the results of the pagerank algorithm on the network. Thirdly, we run Louvain community detection algorithm and compare the results with the existing subreddits.
