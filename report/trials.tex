This section briefly explains the original idea of this project and why and how we deviated from it. We begin by explaining why we switched from social network Twitter to Reddit and subsequently explain the consequences it has had.

The goal of this project was first to perform sentimental analysis (SA) in real time on cryptocurrencies. For that purpose, Twitter was taken as a network source both to discover communities centered around cryptocurrencies and to retrieve text data for SA itself. Influencer accounts (e.g. @Bitcoin, @ethereum, @BTCTN,etc.) as well as hashtags would have been taken as starting points to build the network and the analysis. SA would then have been done both inside and outside communities to deviate correlation and interesting results. Consequently, the end result would most likely have been the currencies' rates with key points (e.g. extrema) that could reveal both SA (in- and outside communities). However, we soon ran into a wall because of the Twitter API limitations, which made the scrapping nearly impossible. We soon thereafter switched to Reddit which has quite a more limitation-friendly API. The problem we had after that was to properly perform SA. Yet, Reddit is more comments-rich than posts-rich, which brings the problem of having off-topics comments that could bias the results. We soon realised that performing SA on Reddit was a tedious task and we therefore put the focus on a global analysis of the network we built.
