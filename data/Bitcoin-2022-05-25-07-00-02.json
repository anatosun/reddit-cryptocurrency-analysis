The most profound cross which signals the macro bottom literally to the day everytime so far.  This new cross I present to all of you in hopes for a good hearted debate on your feelings when you investigate it for your self.   The cross is made by putting the 432 day moving average and the 480 day moving average on your charts.  You'll note that exactly when the 432 inverts below the 480 the entire market sentiment flips and bull run game on.  I take this opportunity to name this cross the bitcoin 432 inversion.  Please experiment with this cross and share your feelings with it.  I have made a video where you can clearly see what happens at every bitcoin 432 inversion.  I hope this post follows community guidelines and I make this post in good faith contributing something that proves to be very promising for the bitcoin world.  Cheers lmk what you think.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12jmWA-o6Ng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12jmWA-o6Ng)",
