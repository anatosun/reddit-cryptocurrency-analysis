I believe the cumulative sums of CB pro wallet dust would be recorded as liabilities on their balance sheet. If they suddenly disappear or move to another classification on the balance sheet without proper explanation, they would be opening themselves up to accusations of misrepresentation of financials at the very least. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some sketchy attorney somewhere with a loophole or shaky interpretation of precedent to essentially allow CB confiscate the dust, but they\u2019d have to want to take that risk. As with most companies, their risk officer will probably analyze and present the C-suite with a cost benefit analysis of some options. They may decide that stealing the cumulative amount of dust outweighs the possible fines and effects on shareholder confidence. Might seem insignificant to some at first, but with millions of users, the total value could be tempting to them if in a pinch. We shall see\u2026",

Only reason I still somewhat invest in crypto on a semi regular basis (once a month on a dip) is due to the insanely low fees CB PRO offers as well as there ease of use to anyone with half a brain. The only way without huge amounts of luck that a person like myself who maybe puts in 10 to 50 dollars at a time and il break that 50 into 4 or 5 limit orders sometimes on the same coin this would not be a feasible strategy any longer, if I had put all my money I to just a few orders becuz of the fees I can guarantee I'd have much higher DCA or orders not filled at all.",

I got hacked and the hacker traded my life savings to eth then traded it to a coinbase pro wallet. I contacted coinbase to find out who's coinbase pro wallet they sent it to and was first told customer service didn't deal with cb pro and only emails worked for it. Then I was shocked to find out days later the pro account belonged to me. I informed them I never signed up for the pro  And they inform me by signing in with the same credentials you automatically get the pro which I found to be ridiculous Since it's a whole different thing Coinbase will not take responsibility and Cannot explain to me why they gave me a pro account that I never wanted with the same credentials And they're very big on telling you make sure you keep your credential safe. why would someone have the same credentials for 2 different accounts which is what they tell you not to do. Does anyone know why a hacker would have to send it to the pro account?  I find it funny that coinbase basically helps them steal from  their customers By giving them a pro account with the same credentials, so if  one gets hacked both get hacked. I wonder if they're trying to phase it out because many people are getting robbed this way. Probably not because they don't care cause they did not try to help me or explain to me why they gave me a pro account With the same credentials",
