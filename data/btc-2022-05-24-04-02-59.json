            "selftext": "HDFS (Hadoop File System) is open source distributed fault tolerant filesystem. Its easily scalable by adding more HDFS nodes. Eg: your current HDFS capacity is 3TB. You can easily add 3 raspi of 1TB each to give total capacity of 6TB.\n\nIn marketing term this is effectively unlimited linearly scalable storage. The raspi hardware doesn't need to improve for you to increase your storage capacity.\n\nHDFS is proven tech. Its the open source equivalent of Google's GFS. Its free to use. It can be used by businesses big and small. Large enterprises can add massive servers to their HDFS storage. Enthusiasts can add Raspi to extend their HDFS storage.\n\nHow does this relate to Bitcoin?  When running a Bitcoin node your datadir is generally on the local filesystem.  If instead of specifying the local filesystem you specified HDFS, storage is no longer an issue. In fact, storage was never a technical area of concern. \n\n* [https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cdh\\_ig\\_hdfs\\_mountable.html](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cdh_ig_hdfs_mountable.html)",

Like a Bittorrent swarm, but for blocks.\n\n> BTW, here is a recent block that is 1,7MB\n\nYeah, that's about the max it's going to get unless the block is filled with abnormal transactions.\n\nThat has been pointed out by on chain scaling proponents since the SegWit soft-fork debate.\n\n> [Assuming that all transactions in a block are spending SW outputs, a 1 MB block will be able transmit to 1.7\u20132X the number of transactions relative to the standard format.](https://medium.com/the-publius-letters/segregated-witness-a-fork-too-far-87d6e57a4179)",
