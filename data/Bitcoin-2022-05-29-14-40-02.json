Therefore, we will try to help you as best as we can. \r  \n\r  \nI will attempt to answer your question the best way possible, and please let me know if I misunderstood anything. The brain wallet on Blockchain.com did not work the same way as a wallet generated from websites like bitaddress.org. The main difference here is that Blockchain's personalized recovery phrase reveals the password of your wallet which you can use to unlock your funds and your ability to sign with your private key. On the other hand, bitaddress generates for you a static private key with its relevant public key, so when you use your mnemonic recovery + passphrase, you directly reveal the private key and not a password to the private key.",

Therefore, we will try to help you as best as we can. \r  \n\r  \nI will attempt to answer your question the best way possible, and please let me know if I misunderstood anything. The brain wallet on Blockchain.com did not work the same way as a wallet generated from websites like bitaddress.org. The main difference here is that Blockchain's personalized recovery phrase reveals the password of your wallet which you can use to unlock your funds and your ability to sign with your private key. On the other hand, bitaddress generates for you a static private key with its relevant public key, so when you use your mnemonic recovery + passphrase, you directly reveal the private key and not a password to the private key. \r  \n\r  \nThere is no technical issue with the recovery link, the only set back you might face is that the recovery phrase only reveals the password of your wallet at the date of creation, so if you happened to change the password then I'm afraid the old one will not work. \r  \n\r  \nI wish I can provide you a solution other than the recovery link mentioned in the previous email, but unfortunately this is the only way. I wish you best of luck with this. \r  \n \r  \nBest regards,",
