            "selftext": "Hey all, I'm a full-stack crypto developer and even though I deeply understood how crypto works, I found PTE games to be super confusing and dangerous. Things like incentivized liquidity for founder exits, out-of-control inflation, character max-use limits, and token pre-sales when there's no product/game yet - all of these can be harmful to users.\n\nMy latest project has been to break down top crypto play to earn games so that you can visualize what the return-on-investment is if you're spending your hard-earned money to play. You can see:\n\n* Minimum Investment required\n* Earnings per day\n* Return on investment (in days)\n* How-to-play guide\n* Optimal strategy\n* Token price\n\n[**FORTHEPLAYERS.gg**](https://fortheplayers.gg/)  \n\n\nI made the calculators with a knowledgable game researcher and the game communities themselves. The calculators are **updated every 10 min using the latest token and NFT prices.** Here's an example of one that we made- [Link to Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SNG3DFxo9s7VLYu4XwtbjsGRWzE2U7T1mCxzhh1t1jw/edit#gid=406151422). We've played all these games ourselves to make sure our information is solid.  \n\n\nThanks for checking it out! Is there something that's missing? Is there a game you'd like to see listed?
