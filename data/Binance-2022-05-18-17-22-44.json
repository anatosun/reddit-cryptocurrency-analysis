The account is verified and I have already been holding some cryptos. However, I want to deposit money with my Debit Card, but it keeps me saying (after filling in my bank details): \"Unable to process. There was a problem processing your payment. Please try a different card o try again later.\".\n\nThe thing is that for maybe a year I haven't done any movement on this account. All those cryptos I am holding have come from other accounts that I did not have verified. The only account verified with my ID and everything is the one that keeps me showing up this error while trying to a deposit with my Debit Card.\n\nI have already opened a ticket, but they haven't answered yet. Do you guys know what might be the problem? I've had no problems on the other accounts depositing with the same Debit Card, dunno why on this one...... And don't tell me is because I might not have funds on my Debit Card, because I do lol \n\nI am quite desperate already and I don't wanna use any other exchange tbh.",
