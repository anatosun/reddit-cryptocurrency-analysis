Ok; You can get its value at your local central bank in gold\n\nBut you can also get your BTC value in USDT paid always. So it is worth its price in Dollars.\n\nSo quite stupid  to say crypto is worth nothing!\n\nIts only humans that give gold, money, and crypto 'its worth.'\n\nBut diamonds and gold are rare. And Bitcoin is rare. Only 18 mln (21 mln!)  will exist. They have almost been mined all. So it can or will become more scarce then gold and diamonds.\n\nMoney is printed every day by governments because they can not budget and can not handle money and can not lead a country and do not save money just spend and spend so they cause and create inflation also.\n\nSo money is not scarce if you print it every day..\n\nBut crypto and money need each other and will live together! Money is ok. Governments are ok; it is as good as it gets.\n\nNew things (crypto) arrive because humans want to make things (aka money) and the experience better!\n\nThe Dollar is winning to be the world currency just because of crypto. Because the biggest used stablecoins are in Dollar.\n\nCrypto has a lot of functions. U can pay with it more and more even at te biggest airline this week.\n\nAt a Swiss bank you can deposit and Withdrawl USDT in the news today. And u can use crypto to gain interest on it. And it has use case a lot of times (settlement of fiat) and smart contracts on it. Crypto is creating Defi; independant financials institutions. Since the banks screwed up in 2008 and we the hard working people had to save them. And You can lend it. You can get a loan. It creates so much jobs and website makers, marketing, nwes, advertisments, devs, new financia products , new institutions meetings all over the world festivals, it creatse an immense economic wave and will get bigger.\n\nIn europe each person paid 13000 euro  to save the banks in some countries\n\nMoney at a bank cost money you have to pay your bank and they control your money and you have to pay interest. It is also in fact not your keys not your coins at banks. If a bank fails you get back only 100.000 dollar max.\n\nIn a fully regulated financial market all the banks did not know where they invested in (and those products were even regulated products!!) So the regulated market with regukated products was worth nothing. And we saved them and we were fed up with them.\n\nBut we do not say you are bad and we atre better; we forgive you but will not forget.\n\nWe are only building better things for us ....\n\nCrypto and BTC are here to stay",

However, there is a HUGE monetary premium on it because of the history of banks using it as their measurement of scarcity for issuing currency. That is no longer the case so as we continue the trend of demonetizing gold it's been difficult for gold to maintain its value against inflation regardless of its actual utility value.\n\n>Money is also worth nothing. Ok; You can get its value at your local central bank in gold\n\nAgain, banks no longer do this. Money (fiat) is not even pretending to be backed by gold anymore. Buy yes it's worthless over time due to the complex debasing of currency taking place with the Federal Reserve and Treasury relationship.",
