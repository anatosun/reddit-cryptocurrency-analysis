You don't want to do anything but hold appreciating assets during inflation. It's real easy. You just spend all your cash and hold something that adjusts with inflation.\n\nLike conservative stock. If you don't know where to go just go buy XLP. Consumer staples. If you're feeling more adventurous buy the S&P 500, SPY.\n\nYou may even consider buy the High Divident S&P500, SPYD. (This is one of the few investments that hasn't lost money this year (eh....that may change today) so tread carefully on this)",
