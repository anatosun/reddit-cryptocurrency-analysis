First it's Badger Mobile wallet, now Bitcoin.com?\n\nAlso, from the title, I assumed you are referring to the smartBCH nfts. But there's nothing in the video talking about smartBCH or doing any form of tokens on it (probably not needed since it's essentially the same as doing it on any other ETH-based chain)",
