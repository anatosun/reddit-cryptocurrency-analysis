And ETH wasn't this gas token.\n\nFor ETH to be a gas token, you'd need gas price in ETH to be fixed. You may not know it, but it's not the case. There's a measure called gas price in ETH. This measure evolves specifically because ETH isn't a gas token and the price of gas constantly moves.\n\nBy the way, nice false dichotomy of a pool. It's a very interesting case study of how politicians try to rule over people. Are you sure you believe in BTC? Wasn't BTC supposed to be decentralized rather than that kind of moves?",

Ethereum is a recreation of the current financial system that we're trying to replace. Most are too new or have fallen victim to VC's, exchanges, and mainstream talking points. Most don't know what they are buying. I was banned and run from two Terra subs raising the alarm months ago. I wasn't trying to divide, I was trying to unite. They've been ruined. Some with decades of work shoveled into that Ponzi.\n\nWith Eth people are buying a gas token that is used to play in an orgy of swaps, wraps, burns, mints, and stakes, run by centralized dapps that do nothing but optimize token interactions to keep the orgy going. As for the only money in the network (WBTC and stablecoins), Eth is used to ferry money around the ecosystem to collateralize the orgy. The problem however, is these versions of money are actually hyper-centralized versions of the real thing  (USD, BTC). Ethereum is a vaporware scam, and when regulations come, the s-curve adoption shakeout will as well. My target is still $800 late this year, and $100 in the years after.\n\nDo not trust Buterin. He did not disappear. He's active on social media, mainstream media, and with celebrities and VC's. He's a megalomaniac selling you tokenized freedom. Like I told Terra plebs: You will lose almost everything here.\n\n[https://twitter.com/HODLneverSODL/status/1467573571312570370?s=20&t=6H15Jdyjj1rHvguY\\_6GDmg](https://twitter.com/HODLneverSODL/status/1467573571312570370?s=20&t=6H15Jdyjj1rHvguY_6GDmg)",

There are good and bad actors everywhere, because there are good and bad actors all around the world and literally anyone can take any role in a trustless system. That's what a trustless system is. \n\nStakers miners, users, everyone can be a good or bad actor. So, stop confusing any role like miners or stakers as a class of people. It's not a class. It's not a \"these are the bad guys\". Scapegoating generally doesn't make sense, but on the topic of a trustless network, it only shows a complete lack of understanding of the concepts involved in it. It's not people being born with a role and not being able to change it. It's not a class of people, it's literally anyone. \n\nThat's why trustless systems don't care about good or bad actors: because it can't afford to make the assumption anyway. Of course, there are many good actors, but bad actors can be everywhere nonetheless and that's the reason why decentralized cryptocurrencies are designed to work even with bad actors. \n\nBut that doesn't change the fact there are many good actors, whatever the role. So, don't claim miners are bad actors. It only shows your own delusions, nothing else. \n\n>There will be BILLIONS spent attempting to thwart PoS, including bribing some Devs (as they have done in the past, disguised as 'consulting fees' etc.), and other similar behaviors. \n\nI don't see what this is supposed to achieve. Billions to do what? Bribing the devs to do what? Anyone can fork it anyway. It's not something you seize or grab. You can't prevent people from accessing it however they want. If some miners want to fork it, they can too. \n\nBesides, you're yet to explain why it would be foolish not to do as you say.",

This synopsis of uncle blocks was helpful in my understanding:   \n\n\n*Uncle blocks are created when two blocks are mined and broadcasted at the same time (with the same block number). Since only one of the blocks can enter the primary Ethereum chain, the block that gets validated across more nodes becomes the canonical block, and the other one becomes what is known as an uncle block. Uncle blocks are recorded and accessible from the chain, but they have no impact on the canonical chain and their transactions do not change any state. Unlike Bitcoin, in the Ethereum system, miners still receive a block reward for discovering the uncle block.*",
