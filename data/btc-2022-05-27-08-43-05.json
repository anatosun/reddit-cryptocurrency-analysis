I personally ran into her in 2021 and lost my family savings, my wife is still angry, and I hate this industry myself. This is a gold mine for scammers, there is as much deception as you can imagine. I advise you to withdraw your blood money from there and not pull fate for one place. Wait for more transparent and controlled crypto projects for investment.\n\nNFTs that no one will buy from you, but you have paid for their minting and placement; distributions with commission payment; \"multiplications\"; coins, from which the developer unexpectedly withdraws liquidity to his wallet through a multiaccount; hacking of wallets and exchanges allegedly by hackers and other murky schemes - this is a brief history of cryptocurrencies.\n\nP.S. I have seen honest projects, but there are very few of them and it is unrealistic to sort them from the scam until you get in.",

The articles are both in Russian and in English. Usually English versions are published with a little delay. Here is an excerpt from one of them (\"Cryptocurrency myths\"):\n\n>Indeed, any new phenomenon that has not yet been mastered by broad masses of people attracts a large number of various kinds of scammers. As usual, scammers exploit the desire of people to get rich quick. Cryptocurrencies are no exception, moreover, the scale of fraud has reached a systemic level. Do not forget that the biggest scammers in the world of finance are central banks, which we already talked about in the last article, but nevertheless they are somehow not considered to be scammers. \u201cIf you want to hide something, put it in the most visible place.\u201d Approximately the same scale of fraud exists in the crypto industry. We will talk more about this later. And therefore, in order to avoid being a victim of large-scale fraud, we must abandon the emotional impulses that urge us to make a quick buck, and instead systematically improve our literacy. That is what we are doing here.",

I figure BCH is a safer bet.\n\nPerhaps we should warn people against using leverage - even 2x is too much. It could even be a scam, but I can't tell. Leveraged trading can conceivably cause bloat to the blockchains themselves, with speculators taking out loans to spam txn rates and fees. On-chain leverage, based on tokens, might be more rigorous than trusting a centralized exchange.\n\n**Big blocks** are needed if Bitcoin is ever to serve like [CashGold](https://www.ebay.com/itm/164961330561), gold embedded in polymer cash. Gold itself could be forked, like Bitcoin & Bitcoin Cash. Gold vs CashGold. CashGold could have a different value (in $), and investors like Schiff would have to convert entire bullion vaults into **cash**! Cash-Gold would decentralize gold, even without cheap XRF machines, to X-Ray scan all the cash notes for **weight & purity**.",
