He wants L2s to basically become an integral part of Ethereum\u2019s chain.\n\nBut for the meantime, my title stays true to its word. L2s are more of a very effective band aid that constantly need change from time to time.\n\nAnd that\u2019s okay as long as L2s keep up this current pace of development.  \nSome find it toxic, but I think the rivalry between L2s is exactly what\u2019s keeping Ethereum alive right now cause each L2 is trying to 1up the other.  \nPolygon and Loopring are both at each other\u2019s neck and have both come up with some great tech as a result of that. We\u2019ve also saw some aggressive development from Zksync resulting in impressive scalability number which landed them lots of funds from bitdao for ZkDAO\u2019s development.\n\nThis is exactly what Vitalik is dreaming of, L2s grinding so hard that eventually they get so good at what they do that it all becomes seamless and part of the process where people think of L2s as part of Ethereum and basically take them for granted as a normal product not independent from Ethereum anymore.",

How are they in any way \u201ckeeping ethereum alive\u201d\u2026 lol where do people come up with this stuff?\n\nWhat\u2019s going on right now is consolidation. There\u2019s been a huge attack against Luna, prior to that the market was down anyway. Weak hands are folding. Illiquid buyers are buying. We won\u2019t be seeing these prices again for a long while after 2022/2023 as the next bitcoin halving takes place in 2024. Ethereum is abt to undergo one of the most significant changes ever which could see it placed in prime position to dominate finance for the next 5-15 years.\n\nEthereum killers have 1/10th the user base at most and will face the exact same problems as ethereum did. Some are even ethereum forks with a few parameter tweaks. They\u2019ve all had problems from what I\u2019ve seen. I don\u2019t see any value in them. They\u2019re offering the same base layer but without the developer ecosystem/developer count/developer uptake. They are not innovating. They\u2019re not leading. They\u2019re doomed from the start. Everyone wants to corner the market but they\u2019re using the technology of yesterday that\u2019s been tried, tested and failed to scale. \n\nWhat\u2019s going on now has nothing to do with L2s. Enjoy it whilst it lasts.",

Starkware has a whole bunch of systems and completed $100m round of investment based on an $8bn valuation. There value went up 4x in 1 yr. why? Because of the deal with GameStop. Looprings fair value should be at least $10 really. Why? Because if ethereum is the financial system of the future it\u2019s massively undervalued by as much as 10x minimum I\u2019d say. As such if L2s are the scaling solution, loopring should be 10x to more or less directly correlate. Chances are however it could do far better than that as it corners market share in the crypto gamefi and defi space due to the userbase exploding from ethereum and GameStop simultaneously. We won\u2019t see anything like that level of uptake with Polygon/other L2s for at least 1-2 yrs which is how long it\u2019s currently taken for GameStop to get this far\u2026 so ultimately I think loopring will do very well. 10x-100x seems perfectly reasonable to me over the next yr or two.",

Today he\u2019s promoting zk proofs as a potential longer term solution to scalbility and a zk evm protocol. Why? Because they\u2019re simpler to build for and simpler to understand. \n\nLoopring is a centralised organisation. Polygon is a centralised organisation. Ex ceo of loopring has now started a decentralised zk solution. I\u2019m sure vitalik is in the loop or will be soon. I mostly follow loopring as I believe it\u2019s a superior chain with greater potential than polygon given its partnership with GameStop and an ex loopring employee working at GameStop to promote it.\n\nIn response to my not agreeing with vitalik\u2026 I can\u2019t possibly know what point your referencing here. But in terms of what OP claimed - \u201cL2s are keeping ethereum alive\u201d - they aren\u2019t. It\u2019s a wrong analysis of what\u2019s going on. But it did catch my attention \u2026 which is why I\u2019m commenting\n\nI\u2019d also add that OPs account doesn\u2019t inspire much confidence that they know what they\u2019re talking about either. A few posts from 2-3 months ago and then some crypto related ones more recently.. seems like a spam acct to me?",
