But I'm terrified of trying to take my holdings off the exchanges. \nI like the idea of a hard wallet but which ones are bomb proof and idiot proof? I need simplicity and something that has a history of lasting forever.\nI understand that I should keep my seed phrase in multiple places separate from my wallet and I like the idea of a stamped metal card incase of fire or water damage. I also understand I should buy direct from the company producing the wallet.\nI think I just need some advice and reassurance.\nAlso what sort of charge/fee will I incur from the exchanges for transferring off the exchange? Coinbase & CryptoCom\nShould I leave my other cryptos on the exchange and just worry about self custody of my btc?",

I believe both manufacturers sell a bundle/option for steel seed backup. And they both provide an easy to use app to interface with the hardware wallet.\n\nBitbox02 hardware wallet is a more premium option and they also offer an intro' call to setup the wallet. And they have backup options like steel and tamper evident bags etc. They have focused on making the user experience very smooth. It is worth a look.
