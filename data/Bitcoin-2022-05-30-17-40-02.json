Even giving away the electricity for free would be a good deal for utilities that are overproducing electricity, just so they don't have to buy the demand from customers; point being, these are the types of markets bitcoin mining can actually help, there is a lot of stranded energy out there, there's renewables that are awaiting grid connection, there's places that experience negative rates etc, these miscalculations can be monetized by bitcoin mining in a way no other load is capable of.",
