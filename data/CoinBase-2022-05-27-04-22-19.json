So I had $6k in my USD (cash) wallet sitting and decided to buy the dip, I spent it all and bought a coin. I was charged $88 in coinbase fees and I can't find a breakdown of it anywhere. Isn't the max maker/taker fee .6%? Shouldn't the max fee I could be charged on a $6k purchase$36? The money was already in my USD cash (not any usd coin) wallet. It also said the USD was .99, since it is a cash wallet, isn't it supposed to be $1.00 at all times (not a stable coin). Thanks",

In some cases, the final fee that Coinbase pays may differ from the estimated fee. All fees we charge are disclosed at the time of transaction. Hope this clears things up! We'll be here if there's anything else. Thanks!",
