            "selftext": "When talking to support, they said that I need to have a wallet and then I can transfer money from that wallet to coinbase. So, I need something like blockchain and then I can send it to coinbase? Is this normal? Secondarily, I've heard bad things about blockchain, so I'm wondering if it's a good option or not.\n\nWhat else do I need in order to get my bitcoin to my coinbase account correctly? There was a warning on Coinbase that said if my thing is setup incorrectly, I'll lose my crypto. I want to make sure that everything is good and ready to receive bitcoin.\n\nLastly, suppose I withdraw from Ignition $1000 in BTC, and it takes 2 days to get to my account. Within those 2 days, BTC crashes and loses 15% value. I've lost that 15% value? Further more, once I've gotten it into my coinbase wallet and withdraw it to my bank account, suppose it drops another 15%. Am I losing yet another 15%?",

It will move to your coinbase account. It shouldn't take more than 30 minutes to be there.\n\nBut I would recommend holding onto that bitcoin and researching what it is about. Yes, it might drop 15%. It might not. But over the next 2-3 years it's likely to go up and be worth a lot more.\n\nYou'd certainly do better hodling bitcoin than you would gambling.\n\nIf you do decide to hodl, create a bitcoin phone wallet using Blockstream Green or Bluewallet, write down the 24 words and keep them safe, and withdraw the funds there. Don't keep them on Coinbase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>BTC crashes and loses 15% value. I've lost that 15% value? Further more, once I've gotten it into my coinbase wallet and withdraw it to my bank account, suppose it drops another 15%. Am I losing yet another 15%?\n\nThink of an amount of bitcoin as a chunk of gold. $1000 is about 0.034 bitcoin, and 0.54oz of gold currently. Just like the gold, that amount of bitcoin will not change as you hold it.\n\nIf the price goes down 15% and then you sell it, then yes, you lost 15%. After you exchange it for USD, even if still on Coinbase, the amount of USD you have will not change with the price of bitcoin.\n\n>I've heard bad things about blockchain, so I'm wondering if it's a good option or not.\n\nThey are a scammy company, known to freeze user accounts and yet is a favorite among scammers.
