Blocks from client X are bad and should be ignored. Unfortunately client X always wins because it's a supermajority and client Y cannot get good blocks through.\n\nA patch for fixing client X is issued. However to fix the bad transactions a chain reorg must take place. But anyone running client X has already voted on previous blocks and double voting in the same epoch is a slashable offence.\n\nNobody running client X will voluntarily allow themselves to get slashed so the bad transactions will remain unless a special exemption is put in place.\n\nTo avoid this scenario no single client should ever have more than 50% network share. This includes execution layer and consensus layer clients.\n\nBoth problems are easily mitigated for large scale operators by running the free open source Vouch service, by Attestant.",
