Would it really be impossible that China disconnects itself from the global internet at some point? How does blockchain react to long periods of multiple networks working in parralel, unaware of each other? In my understanding, that would lead to whole bunch of transactions getting reversed because the network that collected the longer chain - wins.  \n\n\nSurely, that would crash Bitcoin?",

It doesn't rely on DNS or SSL certificates, which are some of the main centralising factors of the world wide web.\n\nThe blockchain already gets shared to a satellite, so in China, it only takes someone to sync with the satellite and then share that data online to bridge the network.\n\nThat isn't the best solution IMO, because China, being just one country is more likely to have the minority hash rate, so the network will seem to favour everyone else's transactions over theirs because the bridge sending txs to the rest of us is small and slow.\n\nAnyway, assuming that never happens, then after some time, the two forks encounter each other. Well this doesn't \"crash\" Bitcoin, Bitcoin just resolves the conflict by taking the biggest chain (in terms of proof of work) and sends the other transactions to the mempool to be re-confirmed.\n\nCan this lead to a double spend, sure it can, but it will take a lot of effort for one person (they'd need to physically travel between countries to pull it off).\n\nTo be honest, I just don't think Bitcoin can be pulled apart for very long. Think of any two real Bitcoin networks as distant lovers, they will find a way to find each other.",
