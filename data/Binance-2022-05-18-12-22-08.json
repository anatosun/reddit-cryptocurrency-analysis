            "selftext": "I discovered something on binance yesterday, which i think a lot of people dont know, so im sharing this information here to save u guys some money. There is a way you could trade nearly everything with zero fees. This is possible through their own (not algorithmic) stablecoin BUSD, which is the third largest stablecoin by marketcap.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9uyhyv2df8091.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c790860f6145869ac200ed4af0923668c56b965\n\nI will start with some general information about the BUSD, it is regulated, fiat-backed and pegged to the U.S. dollar. That means for every unit of BUSD, there is one U.S. dollar held in reserve. With BUSD comes some great advantages, for example being able to trade nearly any crypto with BUSD, not sure if there even is one u cant trade with.\n\nAnother great option with BUSD is staking, you could stake it with up to 10% APY, which is a lot for a coin that has no risk involved. I personally have some BUSD staked at all time, so i could catch a possible dip without having to wait for my fiat money to arrive. Redeeming the staked BUSD will only take seconds and you are able to use it straight away.\n\nBack to the topic \"trading without fees\", i discovered on a binance article (i will link it below) that there are **Zero Maker fees** for all BUSD trading pairs. This means as long as your order is a maker order and your trading with BUSD, you wont have to pay any fee for your trade. Your order is a maker order when it pops up in the orderbook, ready to be taken by someone else, the taker. So when your order wont process directly after making the order, its a maker order, when it gets processed directly its a taker. I think u got the point now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v0sdj84gf8091.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=4082fa7ab4ed815edb8b32132df32d41c695b3e6\n\nThis means you can take any crypto and swap it to BUSD and from there swap the BUSD in whatever u want without any fees. Also there are no fees at all when trading BUSD with USDT, USDC, TUSD and USDP, whether you are taker or maker.\n\nBinance is in my opinion by far the best exchange out there, and trust me i have tied many different exchanges. Biggest advantages are unbeatable or even zero fees, the app is very user friendly while being super complex at the same time and also very transparent. Binance has so many different options for nearly everything crypto has to offer, whether its staking or NFTs or Launchpads or whatever, u name it, they have it.\n\nSo if you are new to binance and you want to sign up, here is a link which will safe you **10%** of all trading fees you cant bypass: [https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=HGAHVKFR](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=HGAHVKFR)\n\nYou could also sign up with my referral code to get the **10%** fee discount: HGAHVKFR\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n9dv73jkf8091.jpg?width=1410&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fc2db7349cbb448ab96845eb022add9375c2fd6\n\nHeres the binance blog article: [https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-widens-access-to-its-regulated-licensed-and-fiatbacked-busd-stablecoin-421499824684903861](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-widens-access-to-its-regulated-licensed-and-fiatbacked-busd-stablecoin-421499824684903861) ",
