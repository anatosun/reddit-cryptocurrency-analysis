It seems like most L1s aren\u2019t that innovative anyhow. They\u2019re just slight variations of each other.\n\nFurthermore, will the best technology even win out? Or will good marketing and funding of crappier projects that are \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d (Ethereum) just squash radical innovation early?",

The repercussions of going from PoW to PoS are already causing debate.\n\nThey are trying to switch to a mechanism that has not a proven track record at scale. The PoS experiments in other chains aren't very promising in my book, even if some work (for now), some miserably fail to all sorts of factors.\n\n> Technology that has strong foundations, especially regarding security is something you really need to get right from the start. \n\nAgreed.\n\n> I agree that it\u2019s not impossible, but leaving things to later is possibly one of the worse aspects of crypto.\n\nMaybe I'm attributing too much weight to the word \"perfect\" here, but in the case of a really perfect mechanism that we can't doubt in terms of security and that would preserve the properties of say Bitcoin, what would be the arguments miners could put forth to convince users/exchanges/developers to not use the hardfork in which their mining became obsolete for example? I don't think there's any and since Bitcoin is permissionnless the fork would happen. Obviously this is all hypothetical, and lies on \"perfection\" existing... still an interesting thought experiment.",

It had little effect on the rest of the industry when it went public partly because it was patented, but the patent has now been lifted.\n\nSaying that, I believe there is plenty of room for existing networks to push forward and carve a space for themselves without being washed away by newer generations. But the thing that will determine any network\u2019s growth and longevity is its practicality - Can it be hacked? Does it serve a purpose (trivial or otherwise)? \n\nSome won\u2019t make it, others will. But they\u2019ll survive on their own merits, not simply because something better is out there.\n\nThis space is no different to any other, look at the history of computing for the last several decade - old ideas that have long been \u201csuperseded\u201d are still playing a role.",
