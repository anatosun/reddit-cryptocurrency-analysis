And if you are in a position where you have to have FIAT in order to live or do something important such as a medical procedure then SELL SOME OF IT.  Maybe ALL OF YOUR COINS.  Life emergencies are more important than **INVESTING**.  Another thing to remember is NOT YOUR KEYS NOT YOUR COINS.  DO NOT keep your coins on an exchange for a long period of time.  Also KEEP THOSE SEED WORDS SECRET.  KEEP THEM SAFE.\n  \nYou want PROOF that I am correct about the price?  How about some TRENDING CHARTS.  Well throw all of them away because not a single one means DICK.  All the **GREEN CANDLES** in the world won't do shit when the price drops.  So hopefully you have read this far in completion and did not just look at the bold and all caps words I used.  Because every single person who posts shit that says they know what the price will do in the future IS WRONG.  What should you do?  You should BET ON BITCOIN if you think it will go up.
