I got perma-banned last night in a certain sub for commenting in a thread about this and giving my opinion on a few things.\n\nHe's not completely wrong though is he? A lot of the value now days comes from the hype and what people think the next person will buy it from them for. I'm not saying it's worthless though.\n\nThe comment that got me banned was mentioning they accepted it once but removed it when it was crippled in 2017, saying it was crippled in 2017 triggered somebody badly, and got 3 mod messages ranting about \"becash\" when I hadn't even mentioned any coin at all, other than BTC. Another mod I DM'd has told me to message them on Monday to appeal, as when I replied to modmail to try and explain what I said had absolutely nothing to do with BCH I was muted for 28 days.\n\nAnybody who runs a store can confirm it was crippled for months after the ATH.\n\nIf my appeal fails, I will post the screenshots in here, it was silly TBH and a massive assumption on every comment I made. I have always been very careful not to mention other tickers in there.\n\nFrom the comments here already I guess I can expect downvotes in here as well.\n\nBut lets be realistic, Bill Gates isn't exactly stupid.",

No restrictions, I could send a random person on the other side of the globe a few cents, or a billion USD for nearly free.\n\nThe price going \"to the moon\" was about adoption from the start. If there's x amount of Bitcoin and the amount of people who want to use those coins grows a hundredfold, the price has to go up sooner or later due to demand.\n\nInstead BTC got crippled, vendors dropped it (For example Valve) and now it's purely speculation and being pumped by Tether. BTC should have collapsed in 2017 when BCH tried to correct course, unfortunately we didn't manage to get that far.",
