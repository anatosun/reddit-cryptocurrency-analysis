I got perma-banned last night in a certain sub for commenting in a thread about this and giving my opinion on a few things.\n\nHe's not completely wrong though is he? A lot of the value now days comes from the hype and what people think the next person will buy it from them for. I'm not saying it's worthless though.\n\nThe comment that got me banned was mentioning they accepted it once but removed it when it was crippled in 2017, saying it was crippled in 2017 triggered somebody badly, and got 3 mod messages ranting about \"becash\" when I hadn't even mentioned any coin at all, other than BTC. Another mod I DM'd has told me to message them on Monday to appeal, as when I replied to modmail to try and explain what I said had absolutely nothing to do with BCH I was muted for 28 days.\n\nAnybody who runs a store can confirm it was crippled for months after the ATH.\n\nIf my appeal fails, I will post the screenshots in here, it was silly TBH and a massive assumption on every comment I made. I have always been very careful not to mention other tickers in there.\n\nFrom the comments here already I guess I can expect downvotes in here as well.\n\nBut lets be realistic, Bill Gates isn't exactly stupid.",

If there's x amount of Bitcoin and the amount of people who want to use those coins grows a hundredfold, the price has to go up sooner or later due to demand.\n\nInstead BTC got crippled, vendors dropped it (For example Valve) and now it's purely speculation and being pumped by Tether.

Bridges have been burnt now though, if you email them now, about BCH for example, even with a good, clear presentation, they email back a flat \"No\". I was stubborn and kept it on my stores and even added a LN option, but in 2022 BTC is only about 5% of my total crypto income, and I don't plan to add it to any new projects. I'm working on a multi vendor crypto only store now, it's something I have wanted to do for years but to do this without a good income already would of been suicide. But these days I earn enough and can try it as a side gig. It's a bit ambitious but I have the proof of concept working and will test it myself as the only merchant for a good while to iron out any issues. We will be accepting BCH, LTC, DASH, XMR, DOGE, and VTC. Vendor payout will be paid in BCH (or any coin on request).\n\nI'm getting to the point where I may even remove BTC and LN from existing stores as well now, for LN I have to run a extra server to accept it without using any third party payment processors and it's the least used payment method out of them all, even behind on chain BTC.\n\nMy views and opinions are clearly not welcome in the BTC communities any more and maybe I should of just removed it long ago, but gave it a chance for literally another half a decade. I feel if I remove it I won't even have to put myself through the pain of being a merchant who accepts many coins in the toxic BTC communities, as despite being a very early adopter I'm classed as a shitcoiner by all these moon boys and BTC maxis, and TBH I'm sick of it.\n\nIt's no longer serving me well and following it just causes me upset and stress more than anything these days. From 2011-2017 BTC was the only coin I accepted, and I'm basically being a hypocrite now, as I don't like the direction it went in but am still listing it as a payment option, it's even possible it's doing me more harm than good as if a customer sees crypto options, they will automatically go towards BTC if they are not experienced with crypto and more than likely have a bad experience trying to obtain it and withdraw it from an exchange, then another bad experience when they send it from a wallet, with costs adding up through this process, and possibly wiping out the discount I offer for crypto payments.\n\nIt says something though if somebody like myself, who is a hardcore crypto fan, starts to think about removing it after over a decade. BTC people tell me it will get better, but it never does, and they keep spreading the \"HODL forever\", \"never spend\", \"bet the pizza guy feels dumb now\" culture. So what is the point of promoting LN as a solution, but then discouraging people from actually using it, then acting toxic towards me when I point all this stuff out?\n\nMaybe it is just time for me to let it go and move on, the only communities my opinions get a good response most of the time are here and the XMR communities, but even in the XMR communities I often experience toxicity as some of them cry about privacy too much, while my opinion is if I'm selling legal goods, and generating a new address for each order, they don't really need such hardcore privacy. I guess I could start looking at people's wallets and following coins, but why would I with no end goal to this, do they think I will go to their house and try to steal their crypto after they spend a small amount of money with me? They should have a separate wallet for spending if they hold life changing amounts of money anyway.\n\nSorry that turned out a lot of text.",

What saddens me the most is they don't want to listen to actual merchants now, and start banning or insulting when you bring up the problems.\n\nAs well as shitting on other projects that wouldn't even need to exist if they had just scaled on chain. If my ban appeal for the Bitcoin sub does not get accepted, I will post the screenshots here, it's actually laughable how the moderator got so triggered, completely based on assumptions as well, sent the ban and multiple raging messages about \"bcash\" but I wasn't even talking about it, I was saying BTC became crippled at the end of 2017 when all the retail investors came along and made the network so congested. Making all kinds of crazy assumptions about what the few comments I made actually meant. It literally was crippled though, totally unusable, I had transactions stuck for weeks, people unwilling to pay as fees were more than some of the products I sold and by the time the price went back down and it was usable again a few months later, I'd already added new coins and most people were then paying in LTC at the time. Whoever actually banned me got massively emotional and jumped to all kinds of assumptions, ranting about \"bcash propaganda\" etc.. so I messaged BashCo thinking it was him at first, it wasn't, and he said to message him on Monday, which I will do as I think I have a good case. I've held my tongue in there so much and been careful not to break any of their rules, even though I don't agree with a lot of opinions.\n\nWhat really annoys me is yes I support BCH, but I also support any coin that people are actually willing to spend with me, the mod was ranting about how I \"HODL\" massive BCH bags and all this crazy stuff, which is so far from the truth, I actually burst out laughing at first, it looked like the mod had a stroke in my message box.\n\nIf they deny my appeal and I am not allowed to post in there again I will share it all. \n\nI'd had a few drinks and last night thought it may of been my fault for a bit, but I read back through it all this morning and it was wild, I didn't do anything wrong at all. The worst thing I did was mock retail investors TBH and be a bit toxic, but nothing on the level of the normal toxicity you see in there on a regular basis.\n\nI just want people to start promoting the use of LN, or it has been a waste of my time and effort, it was these BTC people who kept telling me to add it in the first place.\n\nI feel strange saying BTC people, I was one until apparently I wasn't.\n\nI guess I'm meant to lie about the network congestion at the end of 2017?\n\nWhoever sent the messages from mod mail was unhinged.",

I very rarely actually buy crypto and if I do it's a p2p trade, so only the person I buy it from would know who I am. Then to cash out I normally just buy goods to resell from China, which is not in the 13 eyes and will ignore any requests from governments in UK, USA etc.. with me they could follow coins all day but it would not lead them to me as such, if that makes sense.\n\nI hope I'm making sense, I have taken some very strong pain killers for my back and feel all floaty and slightly confused.
