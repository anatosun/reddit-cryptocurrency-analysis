I recently started trading on tradon.io on a short term investment plan with commodities, and everything has gone well until now that I want to withdraw and my broker is telling me that I have to pay in advance the fees before I can withdraw from there platform to my Coinbase account. This seems to me as a scam as I don\u2019t believe it should be that way. Can anyone help me on this matter?",
