            "selftext": "So my ID is expired but the expiration was extended due to the pandemic. But coinbase id verification system is not designed for these circumstances so whenever i have to send it scan my ID for verification it has to be manually approved and it can take days to a week or more. Now that is frustration and I'm actually waiting again after getting locked for my own security protection haha, and i emailed my selfie they requested and I'm just doing what i can only do is wait wait wait \n\nNow im wondering when you have a current ID is the verification process instant and the lock gets removed after? Like instantly? This process I'm going through takes forever i might go and start working on getting a new ID card and that line itself might be hours but better than waiting a week just to approve a selfie",
