No tracking of transactions. No exchangability. \n\nWhose to say Bitcoin is t going to end up, by the math, by ineffable design, completely useless by some other better technology. \n\nWhose to say that people stop using the dollar. \n\nDoes Bitcoin have an army, a navy, and other defense branches of its government?\n\nBitcoin is governed by the math that outlines how it is valued. I would say most people don\u2019t understand just how complicated the math on either the dollars non fungibility in physical form nor bitcoins value. What if we don\u2019t have power?  What if we can\u2019t connect to a node to verify a transaction because no power. \n\nWhy should we implicitly trust the longevity of Bitcoin?\n\nIt\u2019s a novel technology, a better one doesn\u2019t exist yet. \n\nThe dollar might be fucking Americans but the world is by and large better for most people because of the dollar. \n\nI\u2019m participating because this technology might facilitate human rights concerns. The blockchain is an incredible technology. \n\nBitcoin, also, but less so.\n\nI just think the dollar might be meeting at least some peoples financial needs. But maybe I\u2019m an optimist. \n\nMy needs aren\u2019t met by the dollar but Bitcoin doesn\u2019t really either. I want some coin that\u2019s better for everyone.",

The problem is if we so screw up the dollar and our economy that people start demanding it be priced in other currencies.

And it doesnt help that the first demonstration of Nuclear Power was used as a Weapon of mass destruction, either.\n\nI would bet that nobody in Seattle or San Diego cares that at any given time they are just a few miles away from dozens of Nuclear Power Plants operated by people between the ages of 19 and about 25, but that is twofold in the facts of general public ignorance of their existence, and that they are operated by an organization that has never officially had a Nuclear Accident.",

Genuine question, not being sarcastic.\n\nWhy can't a country have sound money and only spend what it earns?\n\nI know the general idea is that the US is happy to print USD to pay back debt in USD and that isn't a problem to the country as long as the USD stays in global demand but it sure as shit is a problem for all US citizens who have their savings and bank account purchasing power severely diminished each year.\n\nI also know the US is happy to take out huge loans from other countries to lessen the need to print USD and the idea is that in 10/20/30 years when those loans are due the size of the US economy will have grown to a point where those loans are a much smaller burden on the economy than they are now. Take out a loan that equates to 10% GDP now and in 20 years pay it back when it's 2% of GDP, for example.\n\nBut isn't this also how economies and currencies collapse? What happens when the economy doesn't grow fast enough or consistently enough to cover those loan obligations further down the road without crippling the economy? Isn't this what is happening right now in India? What happens when the USD has been inflated so much that working class people with nothing but fiat assets see those assets buy 10-20% less stuff each year and decide to stop playing the game that is so obviously rigged against them?\n\nSovereign debt is a literal Ponzi scheme. Todays debt is covered by an ever expanding workforce tomorrow. Boomer debt is going to be covered by Millennials working and Millennial debt is going to be covered by Gen Z working but it doesn't look like the numbers add up. The west is scrambling to solve this issue now by importing migrant labour but that creates a whole slew of new issues too. US national debt per person is $85,000. I don't see how that is sustainable unless there are 2/3/4 times as many Millennials than Boomers and so on. This seems like Social Security writ large to me. Where there used to be 20 people working per retiree, now there are 2 or something and the whole system is going bankrupt.\n\nSaylor said \"fix the money, fix the world\" and I think part of that is curbing the Ponzi scheme that is sovereign debt. What am I missing here?",

I haven't sorted them out myself.\n\nI was specifically responding to the common notion that there's something obvious about how features and rules of a group of people at the level of a family should apply to a group of people at the level of a nation state. Sometimes. Maybe. But it isn't obvious that things should or even *could* work the same because there's a fundamental difference between the systems and we should expect that difference to produce a different set of possible and likely dynamics and rules.\n\nI was introduced to this idea through geopolitics. I'm not at all an expert, it's just one of those concepts you come across when you venture into a domain. In geopolitics there's a concept of [anarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy_(international_relations)), but it means something different than the way \"anarchy\" is typically used. It means:\n\n>there is no hierarchically superior, coercive power that can resolve disputes, enforce law, or order the system\n\nAt the level of our lives as individuals, families, neighborhoods, and so on up the ladder we can find a hierarchically superior, coercive power that can resolve disputes, enforce law, or order the system...until you arrive at the level of the nation state. At that level things can start to get weird and things like the commonsense ethics of day-to-day living can break down and something that would seem perverse becomes ethical or rational or what have you because there's no higher authority that can help resolve disputes.\n\nAnyway, my point is simply that merely because a family ought to manage life a certain way isn't in itself reason to think that a nation-state should manage itself among its peers the same way. Again, maybe, maybe not. Hopefully that makes what I wrote make a little more sense. I should have fleshed it out more when I wrote it.",

It'd essentially be austerity for no reason. \n\n> But isn't this also how economies and currencies collapse?\n\nUsually hyperinflation or defaulting on debts are just a symptom of a larger issue. If you get to the point where you risk default or hyper inflation you'd still have a ton of issues no matter your level of debt.",

Like the universe doesnt value one thing over another  it is as is. So when a country or people come together to assign  value then they have to contrive  it together. Much like you can use any noises to mean anything but for sake of practical and personal sanity, we agree to use specific noises to mean specific things.\n\nAlso because in a global economy, if your country isnt buying something, some other country is, and in the long run, you are losing resources for it.  For most of our economic system be it land , oil or other resources, it is first come first serve, and as such grabbing all raw materials now and figuring out how to manage them effectively later is better than trying to figure it out first.",

Sounds like an issue to me and disproves your point that every debit has an equal credit, even if you take all money and all tangible assets in existence, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to pay back all the debt + interest - I can\u2019t remember the exact figure , but the interest on American debt alone amounted to like 305 billion per annum - and that\u2019s at historically low interest rates , imagine if we saw interest rates rise to 5%...... can someone please explain to me who profiteers off the interest accrued from but national, commercial and retail debt ? \n\nAlso I don\u2019t see how people don\u2019t have a problem with for profit financial institution? It is literally a conflict of interest between making profit margins and what\u2019s beneficial for the global economy - this literally happened during the times of the Templar knights and all the banking leaders were captured a decapitated for this exact reason\n\nTbh this system works fine as long as there is perpetual growth , once growth stagnates the entire system collapses on itself. The reason people support crypto is so that banks don\u2019t skim the wealth of the people as they are currently doing! By lending you are literally stealing wealth from the future by reducing purchasing power and increasing how much debt needs to be serviced by tax payer dollars annually - again who is benefiting from this ?\nIt is a problem when more money is entering the system than is been burned or value created !\n\nAnd just a question - how would people feel about interest free loans as it currently is in Islamic countries - the reason it is law to have interest free loans in those states is because they remember the collapse from the previous banking system dating all the way back to the Templar knights (the fathers of the modern banking system )\n\nHonestly all people defending this are idiots - all it would take to collapse this entire system would be a hike in interest rates , and we are happy to let a small group of central bankers decide this at a whim ? The issue now is they have created such a giant debt bubble that they need to keep interest rates low and keep printing money or the economy collapses - eventually inflation will out pace economic growth and the system will collapse either way - we are just fortunate that currently this balance hasn\u2019t reached tipping point",
