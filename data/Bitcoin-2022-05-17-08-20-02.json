This is set up on the L1 whilst the transactions within the payment channel occurs on L2. This makes lightning efficient when multiple transactions will occur between the two parties but still seems inefficient if only one transaction needs to be made. \n\nMy question: Can one party set up an \"open\" payment channel that allows anyone to join to send single transactions and then the party who created the channel choose to close this payment channel lets say every night.\n\nScenario: Coffee shop accepts BTC payments. Everyday they open up a payment channel where multiple customers can join to send satoshis. When the shop closes for the day the payment channel is finalised and verified on L1?",
