We also have too much bad news that i go over, though that the best time to buy (in my opinion) is when the fear index is around 10 (14 today, 10 yesterday).  Something positive is that the people that bought during this dip have not sold yet (studying volume) - so mostly dca, not that many scalpers. \n\n[https://youtu.be/OUJ2xJUrzEw](https://youtu.be/OUJ2xJUrzEw)",
