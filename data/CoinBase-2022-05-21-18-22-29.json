For example, you could use that same seed on a different third party wallet app. If you have a Samsung then you should have an option to restore with your google account.  \n\nConfirm that you are logged in to google so it can grab that restoration.  Also make sure that both your phone and Wallet app are up to date.  Once you've restored the account it may be better to hold onto your recovery phrase in the future.
