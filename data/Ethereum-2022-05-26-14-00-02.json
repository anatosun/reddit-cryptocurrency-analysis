I have found this [article](https://elearningindustry.com/impact-of-blockchain-technology-on-the-elearning-industry) about the impact of blockchain on Elearning If you think about it, it will be a win-win situation and it will also be helpful for those who don\u2019t have the motivation to learn. Not just by learning about coins like Coinbase where you can start learning by watching videos and answering quiz questions that run for a certain period of time, Binance where a new user who signed up within 3 days can earn popular coins, Coinmarketcap partners with a variety of new cryptocurrencies and protocols trying to get their name out there, but like Kirin metaverse where they will have games that offer programs that reinforce education and reward learning with crypto assets, and I\u2019m not sure if you will earn something from Bloktopia but it will act as a gateway for users to learn about blockchain and how it's helping power the metaverse.   \nDo you think we will have more learn-to-earn programs in the future?",

This isn\u2019t something you can learn over night.\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing is that people are listening to crap advice posted on r/ethdev. Taking a trivial udemy JS course, doing crypto zombies, and thinking that\u2019s it they\u2019re ready to be a developer. They then go bomb interviews and can\u2019t answer basic questions about fundamental CS and programming concepts that every CS student sophomore in the country could answer. They get discouraged and enter this weird area where they think they\u2019re beyond the basics but because they never learned them properly they start struggling to progress but are unwilling to go back to square one and start with a course for absolute beginners. Employers are then reinforced in their belief that a CS degree is a necessary filter. It\u2019s a shit show\n\nTLDR; we need more serious options but less bloated and costly than 4 year degrees",

Win-win.... get paid to learn and have your credentials sent to potential employers. I'd love to be notified as soon as a potential employee becomes available. I'm already prying in on college campuses to find people in this epic staff shortage. As I'm writing this, I'm thinking about putting together a program myself as a recruiting funnel.",

Doctors, nurses, accountants etc. are all careers that will  be automated at some point in the not too distant future, I believe.  \n\n  \nBlockchain, DeFi et al. are exploding and there are not enough suitable courses out there to provide enough graduates to fill the jobs that are actually available. Therefore, employers are going to have to get their staff from somewhere and educating them yourself seems like the most sensible way to do it.  \nYes, people require currency to be able to better educate themselves, but gone are the days of waitering/waitressing your way through college.  \nThis pandemic has changed the way people prioritise their lives and working yourself to an early grave is sensibly being removed from that thought process. \n\nDecentralisation is the way!\nPower to the people!  \nDo Your Own Research(Learn)!",
