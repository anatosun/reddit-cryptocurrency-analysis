Adding a single slice of lunch meat and some sprouts is another great option. To make the sprouts, grab a bag of birdseed that's all sunflower seeds. Toss a handful in a pot or scatter them in a field. When they get about 2 green leaves, they're ready for soup. \n\n3. The average yard has a lot of edible weeds that taste GREAT and add a lot of nutrition to ramen. Dandelion is my favorite. False hogs beard (looks like dandelion) is excellent too. Dollar weeds are also really good and have a rash type taste. Wild clover is good with chicken or shrimp flavor ramen since it has a lemon taste. (Clover is also good for adding to water for this reason). Just don't mess with any wild onions you find until you are familiar with foraging - there is a look alike called death cammas which can make you really sick. Remember that if it looks like an onion but don't smell like one, it's a cammas. \n\n4. Carrot tops and green onions are SUPER easy to regrow. Just stick them in a styrofoam cup filled with dirt and keep in on a window ledge. Carrot greens are super yummy in ramen and you can grow a lot of them out of literal trash. Green onion you just leave 1/4 inch at the bottom and replant the roots. They will regrow indefinitely. I'm still harvesting from green onions I bought early last year at Publix. \n\n(I eat Ramen pretty regularly. Been doing that a few times a week for ages.)",
