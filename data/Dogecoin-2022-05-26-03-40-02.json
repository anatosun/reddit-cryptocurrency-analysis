Why would an exchange solely rely on users coins to make money on shorts? They keep a stash for this very reason. People can move off the exchange, sell etc and then their ability to provide coins for shorts goes away\u2026no way in hell that is gonna happen. \n\nMove your coins to a cold wallet, ledger if you don\u2019t don\u2019t want to trade. Keep in mind that investors look at number of users that hold a particular coin as a metric to invest. Taking coins off will affect this and could affect price action in dogecoin. Exchanges are a double edged sword.",
