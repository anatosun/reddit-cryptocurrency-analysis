Id like to look at it as. Other than that, if it actually is the same, the time it takes for you to switch from perp to spot is more than enough for the price to move on the 4th decimal. Also, stables fluctuate slightly from the exact 1 dollar Or am i missing something..?\n\nEdit: if you check the prices in usd, under the larger fonted numbers, youll see.the prices in usd, which are then the same on both",
