BCH is cheap enough that 100k BCH still costs 19M, so probably some smart whales are buying during the recent crash and will be next next crypto billionaires.\n\nWith BCH at record low prices it seems like there are panic sellers taking losses and subsidizing coins below even mining prices over the past 5 years, its unlikely that the sellers have a significant supply to sell at such losses and it is expected they will run dry and cause the market liquidity to dry up as the price recovers.\n\nHistorically the price has never stayed in this area long based on market moves over the past 5 years.\n\nBitcoin on the other hand was below current prices for 3.5 years of the past 5 years (at all times prior to DEC 2020) so 70% of the past 5 years Bitcoin has been lower, and sellers might still be in profit to a large degree.",

Since what they stole have to be kept in Crypto they can\u2019t let the price crash. It\u2019s obvious they don\u2019t want to print more as they fear total collapse. So at the right time (collapse of Luna) they start buying back large amounts of Tether (8 billion) which crashed the market 40% and then burned it. That means the pump days are over and we will be in bear market till most of the tether supply is gone.\n\nTether is deleveraging first, before the rest of the world does. Quite a smart move, they might pull it off, be gone in a couple of years and still sit on 10% of all crypto bought for free with funny money.
