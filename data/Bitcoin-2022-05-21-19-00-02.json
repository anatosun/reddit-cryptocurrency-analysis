A typewriter requires vastly more energy to produce than paper and ink. It requires machines and factories that are virtually impossible without electricity or economies of scale. No blacksmith ever would undertake the production of typewriters in bulk, and if they did the resulting mining, smelting, and smithing operations would be an environmental disaster of monumental inefficiency - certainly not a boutique \"local\" operation run by people of ordinary skill. It's more expensive than paper and ink, and incapable of producing any leap in quality of output by itself. Left alone with no human operator it produces the exact same result as a pen- nothing.\n\nHis reasoning is entirely vacuous and pretentious, dressed up in noble ideations that make him sound like a superior person but ultimately resolve nothing and fail to even defend his current choices.",

He said George Lucas was a retard who deserves to die for thinking a camera could ever be digital and even dumber for \u201cexpecting the world to adopt a whole new set of projectors.\u201d I think like 5 years later everything was digital.
