Quite likely some big players shorted bitcoin when UST crashed (since LFG had a bag they needed to sell so it would drive the price down), and made a fortune, so they closed their shorts, had a lot of USDT and decided to cash it out.\n\nTether appear to have investments in US gov treasuries, \"commercial paper\", and cash in banks.  So if you send them $1, they may put it into various different things in order to generate some interest/earnings that they keep as part of their business model. \n\nBasically it will work as long as people don't ask for more than they have readily available, since they might take a hit to liquidate enough assets to cover a lot of USDT redemptions. So if they kept 10% liquid, then they could cover $7.5 billion in redemptions, but what if someone tries to redeem $10 billion?\n\nTether is also centralised, so they would just freeze the funds if you hacked them directly. They could (and have I believe) had their bank accounts frozen or funds blocked, but that's for them to sort out, it shouldn't affect their business even if they need to hire some lawyers to get it back.",

Unless the US finally calls them out on their BS backing the show will go on. These bumps might be insiders and friends cashing something out when there is still something there. My estimate is either Q4 this year or Q1 next year that they will either collapse, or somehow manage to cash out while crashing the crypto market.",

That and propping up the price of crypto and allowing bitfinex to build back their BTC reserves during price drops.\n\nCrypto makes a lot more sense when you stop thinking \"this can't possibly be legit\" and start thinking \"how is this benefitial to criminals/ embezzling, money laundering etc\". Sure it's got it's legit uses here and there,  but that's always been a facade , if you know the history of crypto it's pretty obvious, not that it's specifically for criminals but it was to avoid government regulation and criminal use was an obvious major consequence from that.
