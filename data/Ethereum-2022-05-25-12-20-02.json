It's not a Ponzi, here: you're the only one suffering from your mistakes, no one has a benefit in convincing you, except to have a pleasant conversation in sharing experience and knowledge. \n\nIf you want to know something, like the scalability it brings, how secure it is, how convenient it is, how specialized it can be and such, ask away. That would be interesting conversation. But there's clearly no need for anyone to prove your vague belief to be wrong.",
