                    "response": "Your Trezor (like all hard wallets) simply encrypt your private keys. There is no bitcoin in the wallet. Bitcoin never leaves the blockchain. Your private keys are generated once you create a wallet. Your TREZOR will do this the first time you set it up. You will need to write these private keys (24 words) down and keep them in a secure place.\n\nYour hard wallet will require a PIN to open the device and to sign (send) transactions. You will set this PIN when you first set up the wallet.\n\nTrezor has its own site. Here you'll find Trezor Suite, which is a desktop suite that you see your balance and transact from using your connected hard wallet.\n\nYour Trezor wallet will work with any desktop wallet, you don't have to use Trezor Suite.\n\nIf Trezor goes out of business or you break your hard wallet it doesn't matter. The only thing that matters are the private keys you have safely stored. With these, you can recover your bitcoin with any other hardware wallet or from any software wallet in the world.\n\nAfter you are comfortable, find what's called your Trezor wallet's *xpub.* Plenty of tutorials out there for this and it's stupid simple even for those not technically inclined. You can import this xpub into any mobile wallet on your phone and create what's called a *watch-only* wallet. This allows you to see all inbound/outbound transactions, and to generate addresses for receiving bitcoin. No bitcoin can be sent or spent however, making it safe to have on your phone, desktop, etc.\n\nLastly, buy your Trezor direct from manufacturer. No third parties, no used hard wallets.",
