The rocketpool Software stack simplyfies running a validator A LOT compared to solo staking.\n\n\n- In my opinion rocketpool is as trustworthy as it gets apart from straight up solo staking. Smart contracts ran through 4 Audits and using it is trustless and Permissionless\n\n\n- its also more profitable than solo staking as you get additional comission from the liquid stakers supplying you with the other 16 ETH + currently roughly 13% apr on your RPL collateral you have to lock up\n\nI suggest you join the rocketpool sub and discord for more Information and help",
