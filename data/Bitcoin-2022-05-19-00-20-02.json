After that, additional income did not make much of a difference. I tried looking for the source but just couldn't find it. I'm sure there's more research on the topic available.",

At 60k, you're not going to be rich, but you will be able to, within reason, buy everything you want - car, holidays, house mortgage, new iPhone once a year, a night out a few times a month. I think that's mostly what this is all about, being able to get what you want. Earning more (over 60k) will just let you buy nicer stuff, which is not nearly as impactful of a change to your life as fulfilling your needs and wants in the first place was.",

Unfortunately I cannot find the numbers in the latest study of the article above to see how relevant it actually is.\n\nI have had many experiences and bought many things over the years and I derive much longer happiness from, for example, listening to my CDs over and over again than from the concerts I went to (some of which I have very little memory - I am not that young anymore I guess). I could say the same thing about a bike or a car or even an outfit.\n\nOn a more general note, there is a tremendous pressure to go out there and \"do\" the  Louvre, the Australian outback, Turkey, Bali, etc, etc essentially throwing money out of the window in exchange for a time limited experience. I come to realise that this is a purer form of consumerism than buying assets, enjoy them, and maybe resell when times are tough - I mean, very much in the Bitcoin saving spirit!",
