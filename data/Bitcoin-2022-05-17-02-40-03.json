Won't turn on no power bought a new charger and replaced the ac adapter plug still no luck turning it on. Btc price was pretty low back than and didn't really care to recover any funds I had on it because i didnt think it would be worth fixing it. I completely forgot about it and still have the computer. How can I check if there is anything left on the hard drive without having to replace the motherboard? Any help would be appreciated...",
