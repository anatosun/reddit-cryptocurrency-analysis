                    "response": "I sold at like 26 cents when I realized it wasn't going to skyrocket again. Sorry to say that was right and it was one of the best moves I've made in the stock market so far, considering I would have had all of my stock money tied up for the entire past year if I had tried holding any longer. \n\nMade a lot more money by getting out while I was ahead and making other moves, versus being way down on that original position holding until now.\n\nMaybe I'll buy in again at some point since it's still pretty low, but there are a few other moves I'd like to make first. It's just gonna be hard for it to gain a lot of momentum without big funds buying in, considering there are now 5 billion more coins in circulation over last year, so on and so forth.\n\nSorry I wasn't a diamond hand, but I'm in the market to make money, not be way down for an entire year or two. My condolences to anyone that got caught on the pain train, but I hope it pays off for you big time in the end.",
