Around 650k if I\u2019m not mistaken. That\u2019s a lot of misallocated money. Unknowingly hurting Dogecoin strength in a price sense.\n\nWithout proof of backing of the asset. I would say that is immensely important. With proof of backing then it is a non-issue and doge-token is just another cross chain bridge and actually beneficial for the ecosystem. \n\nBut without proof of backing. It\u2019s possibly counterfeit Doge. Which is simply not ok.",
