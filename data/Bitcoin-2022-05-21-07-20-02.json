I buy when the price is low to use to buy shit when the price is high, thereby locking in gains while supporting the infrastructure.\n\nAnyway, I went to buy some cheap bitcoin on pro.coinbase, and they asked for my drivers license. Fuck. So, yeah, I plugged my camera in and was ready to send them my ID, but pro.coinbase didn't notice the camera. I tried multiple times. BUT, I could log on to regular coinbase and  buy there AT A HUGE PREMIUM. Right. No thanks.\n\nWhat's wrong with this picture? Fuck Coinbase. This is not right. I no longer trust Coinbase.\n\nEDIT: I should have noted that I've been using pro.coinbase for  years.",
