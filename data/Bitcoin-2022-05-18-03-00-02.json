And when that monarch addressed him with greetings, and asked if he wanted anything, \"Yes,\" said Diogenes, \"stand a little out of my sun.\"[7] It is said that Alexander was so struck by this, and admired so much the haughtiness and grandeur of the man who had nothing but scorn for him, that he said to his followers, who were laughing and jesting about the philosopher as they went away, \"But truly, if I were not Alexander, I wish I were Diogenes.\"[8]",

Add some water, a quart or two, bring to boil.  Add a 1/2 lb. dry lentils.  Simmer them for about 30 minutes.  Keep an eye - if it all becomes thick, add more water.  After 30 min: Add a big can of crushed tomatoes.  Add some chopped vegetables: one or more of: Carrot, Celery, Zucchini, Brown Onion, (Red) Bell Pepper, Roma Tomatoes...  Season with chicken (or beef) stock (I like the \"Better Than Bullion\" brand), black pepper, thyme and a few shakes of either authentic Mexican taco sauce or Tabasco sauce.  When the vegetables and the lentils are all tender to your satisfaction, remove from the heat.",
