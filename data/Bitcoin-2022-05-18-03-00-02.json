And when that monarch addressed him with greetings, and asked if he wanted anything, \"Yes,\" said Diogenes, \"stand a little out of my sun.\"[7] It is said that Alexander was so struck by this, and admired so much the haughtiness and grandeur of the man who had nothing but scorn for him, that he said to his followers, who were laughing and jesting about the philosopher as they went away, \"But truly, if I were not Alexander, I wish I were Diogenes.\"[8]",
