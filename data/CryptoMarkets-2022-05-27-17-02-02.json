Considering because btc dominance is soaring, I feel like the wyckoff distribution pattern is gonna play out on the ETH/BTC valuation, and if that happens, eth could drop another 50% according to the logarithmic regression indicator I used on trading view. Wondering what other people think. Thanks",
