            "selftext": "The story of Earth is incomplete without the vaults of Gold and other treasures. But today, about 50% of the mined gold is just stored in bank vaults. At a time when the fight against climate change requires immediate action, the mining industry continues to emit between 4-7% of global greenhouse gasses (GHG)1. In fact, scientists estimate that the industrial activity needed to mine just one ounce of gold causes the emission of up to 800 kilograms of GHG2!\n\nObviously, technological evolution brought many alternatives, one in the form of cryptocurrencies. But then, everything comes at a cost. And cryptos aren\u2019t growing on trees.\n\nAccording to the University of Cambridge, Bitcoin mining alone generates about 132.48 terawatt-hours (TWh) annually and the CO2 emitted by this varies on how that energy was created. In fact, in 2020, the US generated 0.85 pounds of carbon dioxide per kWh, which resulted in nearly 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide produced by US Bitcoin mining alone!\n\nOpening their eyes to the harrowing impact of this \u201cnew currency\u201d, a lot of cryptocurrencies are trying to come up with alternative mining solutions, that would require less energy and could provide solutions to problems such as the need to accelerate ESG investments that can preserve the environment or the need for a secure, net-zero bridge between a dominant real-world store of value,i.e., gold, and the crypto asset world, without the environmental and social impact of either real-world mining or Proof of Work mining.\n\nCompanies are coming up with new investment alternatives including a tokenized\nInvestments like Nature\u2019s Vault are backed by the preservation of at least 1/100th of a gram of gold in the ground, thereby ensuring forests, ground soil, and their associated ecosystems are not disturbed by gold mines, fossil fuels are not burned in mining activities and local and indigenous communities are not harmed by collateral impacts such as heavy metals contamination of groundwater, rivers, and lakes.\n\nBut do you think it\u2019s enough? Can cryptocurrencies ever become 100% environment-friendly?",

But right now clean energy isn't being built-out because there are no customers during non-peak hours even while power is being generated, most batteries aren't environmentally friendly or ideal so instead of wasting the energy or not building at all they put it into BTC to send somewhere that needs that energy instead (like electric oil).\n\nPOW isn't used very much because it's not practical to decentralize using it anymore, the available and specialized cpu/hashrate power globally is just so high now. It's being phased out. BTC halves it's issuance every 4 years so it's incentives are being phased out too, it'll all sort itself out over time.",

It also requires a stable form of power, a mining operation is losing lots of money tied up in capital investment if it has to have half the rigs turned off because there isn't too much power being produced. This means they want an increase in base load, which is not adequately serviced purely by renewables.\n\nProof of this is mining companies buying and recommissioning coal and gas power plants purely for the purpose of BTC mining.\n\n2021 - [Stronghold Digital Mining decommissioned coal plant in PA for mining operation](https://futurism.com/bitcoin-mining-company-buys-entire-coal-power-plant)\n\n2020 - [Marathon makes deal with coal plant in Montana about to close to increase power output just for them](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/18/bitcoin-miners-revive-fossil-fuel-plant-co2-emissions-soared)\n\n2020 - [Greenidge Generation recommissions mothballed gas plant to run mining operation](https://apnews.com/article/bitcoin-mining-new-york-power-plant-climate-change-516dbd319394a6a30f83d94947abad20)\n\n2018 - [IOT Group try to reopen coal plant in Australia that had been shut for 4 years to mine. ](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/blockchain-coal-power-plant-mining-bitcoin-cryptocurrency/) It is worth noting, this never got off the ground but primarily due to environmental backlash.",
