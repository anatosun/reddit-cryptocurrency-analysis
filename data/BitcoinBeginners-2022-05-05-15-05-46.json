If your risk tolerance is higher, and you believe you are making more than paying off your student debt right away, then that is a reasonable plan.  My wife carried high credit card debt to pay for her college education as she wasn\u2019t eligible for school loans. Many would have scolded her for what she did, however once she and I had jobs after college, we quickly paid off those debts and don\u2019t regret it one bit today. Everyone\u2019s risk tolerance, as well as mental well-being around those risks are different - therefore, it\u2019s important not be bullish one way vs. another.

            "selftext": "Enabling whitelist feature on exchange is a simple way to protect yourself from a potentially losing your funds do to compromised credentials.  By the time you realize you have been hacked the bitcoin has already been transferred out. Usually within minutes. Even if you don't want to store your BTC with a hardware wallet you should still enable whitelist even if you leave your withdrawal address list blank. This effectively buys you time. Whitelist is basically pre approving addresses you own.\n\nAdditionally you should take the time to setup a hardware wallet and protect your recovery seed. By doing this you can generate a wallet address that you own and store it in your exchange account and then add it to WHITE LISTING(basically a pre approved receiving address). You white list the address so that  in the future if your account gets hacked. The hacker will be unable to add a new receiving address instantly and transfer funds out. It can buy you valuable time to get your account locked down and to get control back of your account.\n\nWhen you enable whitelist on Coinbase it will put a 2 day hold on any new addresses being added to the account. Gemini it buys you a 7 day hold.\n\n[Coinbase whitelist help here](https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/managing-my-account/other/how-does-whitelisting-in-the-address-book-work)\n\n[Gemini whitelist help here](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001411543-What-is-an-Approved-Address-)\n\nIn my opinion you should create a unique email for each exchange you use. So that if the email shows up in a data breach you know it was most likely compromised in a data breach from the exchange. Use 2fa hardware key like YUBIKEY for 2fa. Dont use SMS for 2fa.",
