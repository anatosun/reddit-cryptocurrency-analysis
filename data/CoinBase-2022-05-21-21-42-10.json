Now I quickly told her the email was fake and asked if she clicked any links and entered any details.\n\nNow before i get into that, the email doesn't even try and get you to log in. It looks like a legit receipt email just stating what was purchased for how much. Non of the IF THIS IS INCORRECT LOG IN HERE nonsense. Legit just telling her of the purchase. \n\nAnyway I saw the email that sent it was all over the place and concluded it was fake but she did click a link on the email. Now instead of it opening a web page on her browser (iphone so probs safari) it just opened her app... Is her CB account compromised now? She changed her password but thats more so for PC browsing, the mobile app just logs you in no questions asked. Is there anyway she can resecure her account without transferring to a wallet. She aint techsavvy and it'll be a bit long of a learning process right now.",

We recommend referring to the help center articles below for more information and guidance. \n\nEmails from Coinbase will always have the coinbase.com domain name at the end of them.

You allowed someone from multiple 4 different IP addresses, one of them in a different country, to take over $6,000 from me in less then two minutes. They were also allowed to make a CB Pro account and transfer everything out of there without question. They tried to reset my password almost a dozen times! I\u2019m still out all of my money and you all never tried to help once. I\u2019m completely broken because of you Coinbase.",
