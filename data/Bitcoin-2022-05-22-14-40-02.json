After watching El Salvador basically ignore crypto with 86% of businesses not having processed a single bitcoin transaction, why are we so excited that 3rd world countries would choose to adopt bitcoin?",

The government is now just an added cost to doing business for allowing them to operate more freely at the expense of stability within communities. You see it with corporations coming into small towns. Without giving my location, then I've seen it first hand with Walmart and TSC which eventually drove out the local grocer and hardware store. No longer after over 30 years of being there because of not being able to compete.\n\nNow, you can make any excuses you want but that was allowed by the local government who pocketed something in return and so they are to blame as well. And you can make the excuse of \"people can boycott\"...but come on. We know socially that's not going to happen because of already low net worth and so the opportunity to save \"a little bit more\" is targeted by these corporations who can operate on losses for far longer than any small business can. So, the social responsibility of the business to the community wasn't even a concern. It was always profit seeking at all costs and it was allowed by the government who are also paid for.
