Bitcoin two years ago was \u00a32,872.45... it\u2019s now worth \u00a338K!\n\nChecks crypto wallet and discover I withdrew my investment (\u00a365) to cover a date with my girlfriend (now ex) for cocktails and chicken wings. It\u2019s now worth \u00a3800 today. \n\nRemember it\u2019s not worth withdrawing for short term goals. Long term is the game.\n\nTL;DR: Took money out of Bitcoin investment to put for date. Bitcoin investment increased by 1200% \ud83d\ude22\n\nEdit: thank you so much for all the upvotes and the rewards. Much appreciated!",

I've recently started to invest in bitcoin and I'm not sure if I have to withdraw all my investment as soon as I see that the value of BTC is going down.\n Also I've read that you can't risk more than 2% of your investment. \nOr Should you really keep your money there on hold and wait for the price to go up?\n\nWould be great if you could help here! Thanks!",
