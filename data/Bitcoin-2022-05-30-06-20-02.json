It just has to be some point you know the private key to, as that will be required when signing for it. You could use `Q=P` directly, and strictly speaking you don't even need to use BIP32 to derive `P` (though many wallets may not offer any other way).\n\nAs to why the tweaking from `P` to `Q` is still recommended: there are more advanced scenarios in which you may wish to be able to *prove* that no script path exists. Using the tweaking mechanism permits that, as you can reveal `P` and the method by which `Q` was computed from it (without revealing the private key), which should suffice to convince another party that you didn't hide any actual scripts in there. In the single-key single-party use case you're talking about, there is nobody to convince probably, so this doesn't matter, but for compatibility reasons it's nicer to pick a single standard.",

Poker Stars, for example, uses cosmic background radiation to shuffle their card decks and cloud flare takes pictures of lava lamps to generate random numbers (interesting video here: https://youtu.be/1cUUfMeOijg). Of coarse there are no lava lamps or cosmic background detectors in the average PC or smartphone so another approach is needed. Most modern computers probably have a good random number generator. I say probably because this part is usually in the \"secure area\" of the CPU and is not open source but researchers have looked at the outputs of these random number generators and have determined that they most likely do generate true random numbers. The problem is more with computers that do not have that and have to rely on pseudo-randomness. A third concern is how the wallet software uses these functions,... I remember a very poor implementation of a wallet that simply used the date and time as the input to generate the seed. Once this was discovered people were able to \"guess\" or \"re-generate\" other peoples seed. The rabbit hole is endless and if you really want to go full tinfoil hat here, there are hardware wallets that allow you to flip coins or roll dice to generate a true random number.",
