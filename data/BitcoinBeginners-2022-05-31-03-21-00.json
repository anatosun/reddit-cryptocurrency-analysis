Each 11 bits \u201crepresents\u201d a word. Thus, you have 3 bits leftover (256-(11*23)). These 3 bits have 8 possible combinations and thus 8 possible words.\n[If you\u2019re interested in how a seed phrase is created incl it\u2019s checksum](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/how-a-seed-phrase-is-created).\n\nOr if your interested in learning more about seed phrases, checkout /r/seedstorage",
