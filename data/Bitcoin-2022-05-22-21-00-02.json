That means there is no such thing as deposits and withdrawals, it's all yours already! You just exchange directly with other peers. So no daily limit.\n\nAlthough there is a limit *per transaction* in the beginning when your account is new (0.1 BTC). To remove that limit, you just need to have your account signed (by doing a transaction with another signed account) and then waiting a certain amount of time.\n\nAll that is not really a problem because you can do as many transactions as you want. It's just a good security measure.",

Once you have the coins in a wallet you alone control, they all work anywhere in the world as long as you have internet connection.  No one can stop you from transacting to any other wallet.  \n\nSecondly on the \"low transaction fees\" point...there are usually fees associated with buying Bitcoin when you buy them on centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase.  These fees vary but are usually small (<0.5%).  But there are also **actual Bitcoin transaction fees** required to get your transaction confirmed on the Blockchain.  These are enforced by the protocol and the miners and they can vary significantly depending on how many people are using the network at any given time.   With good legit wallets these fees can be set by the user using their wallet software... You can set it as low as 0.00000001 Bitcoin...but when you go that low there's no guarantee miners will include your Tx in their block.  They'll generally mine the highest fee Tx's first, so in times of network congestion it could take many hours/days to ever confirm.\n\nThe actual Blockchain transaction fees can be steep if you want to be in the next block.   Even in really low congestion times, expect to pay anywhere from $0.10 or even up to $1.00 to get your transaction confirmed in the next block...because of this, it can be very expensive to make small transactions.   You don't really wanna make a lot of tiny payments in the 1$ or 5$  range on the base layer because the fees will be a high % of your Tx amount.   For that reason Bitcoin has a second layer (Lightning network) with essentially 0$ fees... \n\nDefinitely do your research.  Whatever wallet you choose to go with, make sure it's Open Source and has been vetted by the community so you know it's legit.",
