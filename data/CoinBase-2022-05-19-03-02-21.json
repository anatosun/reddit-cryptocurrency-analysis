It was a bunch of tweets going back the years saying the same thing, \u201dCrypto is dead.\u201d And that part was nice and had meaning, right? That was a good statement. And then it switched to their logo and a horrendous song, and then a butchered logo representing their 10th anniversary, \u201cC10NBASE\u201d. That\u2019s just not a good logo, right? It hurts the eyes. Anyways, rant over, mods ban me if u want <3",

            "selftext": "***Initial email sent to Coinbase, after 3 hours of CS had me plucking hairs out of my eyeballs!***\n\n**Good afternoon,** \n\n **Case #11724154** \n\n**Basic transaction of swapping currency in Coinbase Wallet. Swap from CRPT TO ETH was confirmed at roughly $65,000 minus fees. To be exact, check the hash transaction swapping 174,258.015597920277296361 CRPT to ETH. Coinbase swapped it using UNISWAP for $29,550 which was incorrectly valued at .1696 cents per token. I have printouts of all the uniswap transactions from that day, time, hour and minute. All CRPT to ETH sell transactions were between .35 CRPT to .46 CRPT.\u00a0 When you view the CRPT price chart for the entire day, not once did the currency drop to the amount of .1696. I am conducting the proper procedures for this huge error prior to contacting my attorney, per the Coinbase rules and regulations. I have 6 hours of printed chat from 5/7/22 and 5/8/22 so a case is open. Customer service was of no help and made matters worse by not escalating the issue to a higher authority. I am out over $35,000 and this is not the first issue I had that day, but the most glaring and unacceptable by all measures. As a businessman and someone who likes to conduct a transaction with full intent and honesty, this is a matter which must be resolved quickly. There was no such volatility with either token at that time, not even that entire day. Coinbase received a large fee for the transaction, as did uniswap. I am okay with the fees being high, although they were not advertised to me prior, it simply said \"it is a busy time and fees are higher than normal\". These fees are recorded in the hash transaction as well and I am still short $35,000. I am asking for an immediate reply and remedy of this error, as there are no other transactions showing that this is \"normal practice\". No one loses close to 60% of their funds by having a locked transaction and paying fees, which are recorded. Again, I would like to avoid litigation, but will do what I must to protect my assets. This is the second step I have taken to remedy this situation and my legal team advised me to go with this route first, as this is preferred by Coinbase. I agreed and am willing to be respectful, as long as the remedy is swift. I have printouts of every conversation I have had with customer service, along with detailed logs of every CRPT to ETH transaction through uniswap along with many other documents showing that this was an anomaly. I thank you kindly for the time and look forward to a swift resolution and the ability to regain my trust in Coinbase, the largest trading platform in the world for cryptocurrency.**\n\n**Below is the Hash transaction for what is being described above.**\n\n[**https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe4c1ac148ddbe54e827ca547a1550369d15ff0351e9bd2f2020cfc542009268e**](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe4c1ac148ddbe54e827ca547a1550369d15ff0351e9bd2f2020cfc542009268e)",

Price slippage - The difference between the expected price of an order and the price that the order actually executes. Slippage is caused by the amount of liquidity, which is how quickly you can buy and sell an asset without impacting the price. So, if there is low liquidity or low trading activity in the market for a specific asset, then the slippage percentage will be higher. Coinbase Wallet will cancel any trade that exceeds a certain slippage percentage to prevent customers from losing value. \n\n***You did not cancel the trade, thus did not prevent or warn me of any slippage. The volatility at that hour was just fine, nothing out of the ordinary whatsoever. This was a basic swap. I did not leap on a rocket and try to jump off with everyone. The token continued to escalate in value after the swap, which is quite telling.***\n\n\r  \n2. Exchange Rate - before approving a trade quote, check to see if there is a warning of a price difference. This warning is important to review as it is stating the output is at a large difference from the spot price of the token at that moment.\n\n***There was no warning, only a \"networks are busy pop-up and a gas fee of $650\" which was approved. Not once was there a warning of slippage or selling my assets for 60 cents on the dollar, not ever.***",
