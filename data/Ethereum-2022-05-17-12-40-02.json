                    "response": "https://ethereum.org/en/staking/\n\n4.3% APR right now for a basic solo validator. \n\nAverage APR post-merge is really hard to guess since it's dependent on network traffic/congestion. Could be around 10% APR, but could also be less. If you're in a big pool I think 6-10% is likely for several months post-merge. \n\n> Also, will it be a stable and guaranteed APR? Has network usage and charged fees any influence on APR level?\n\nThere is a base \"guaranteed\" APR that will lower over time as more validators join the network. Then there is the APR from block tips, which is highly variable and will also get lower as more validators join the pool. Block tips will go up during periods of high congestion, mainly NFT mints. \n\n> If possible would like also to know how different is the staking APR of you have at least 32E and run a house by yourself. Is it require much technical knowledge to do that?\n\nSolo staking APR is 4.3% currently; pooled staking is 10-25% less than that due to the pool fees. It's not too technical, there are great guides on /r/ethstaker.",

The staking returns are *purely* from printing new tokens. So if staking APR is 7%, that's actually 7% new tokens diluting existing holders. This goes for pretty much all L1s, aside from BNB, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nNow consider tax - assuming that applies to you, your returns are actually negative.\n\nToday, and definitely post-merge, staking returns come mostly from fees and blockchain usage, so holders aren't diluted into the ground.",

Validator fee will naturally decrease overtime, as it will be perceived as unnecessarily high. \n\nAnd if it doesn't, it will attract many more people to the staking activity and will decrease the reward anyway.
