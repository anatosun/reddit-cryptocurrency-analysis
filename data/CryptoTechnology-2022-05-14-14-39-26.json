Is it because they think regular people don't know how to make a USB as secure?\n\nI've even gotten to the point where I've gotten metamask to recognize my USB as a hardware wallet from the small selection they give you. \n\nWhat is the point of spending $50 when I can bet there's no way 100 MB is worth it when I know for a fact my current wallet is 200 MB.",

They're not just storage, they're a wee little computer that hides a private key away inside it with no way for the private key to ever get back out (aside from the recovery phrase, which you should never ever put into digital form). The hardware wallet can use that private key to sign transactions, but can never be hacked because the silicon that has the key on it is physically isolated from any electronic pathways that it could follow.",

You create your unsigned transaction outside the Ledger via whatever mechanism, for example \"transfer eleventy billion Flooz from address X to address Y\". Then you feed that transaction into the Ledger, hit the \"sign this\" button that's physically on the Ledger's casing, and the Ledger spits out the cryptographic signature that tells the blockchain that that specific transaction is authorized. Only the signature comes out, the private key and the microprocessor that did the work to create the signature from it stay inside the Ledger.\n\nHardware wallets are generally designed so securely that even if you physically have the wallet in your possession it's still going to take a ton of highly specialized equipment to even attempt to pry the private key out. And the wallet is on a hair trigger ready to destroy that private key if it thinks you're trying to do that. I've got probably the lowest-end Ledger on the market currently, since I just use Ether for practical purposes rather than investment, and it automatically factory-resets itself after three failed attempts at entering the PIN to unlock it. I expect the higher-end units that have onboard batteries would have ways of detecting if their casing was opened to wipe themselves immediately.\n\nThese things are definitely more than just low-capacity USB sticks.",

One wallet does not support bitcoin segwit but supports TRON, another one only applies Cosmos Network, and etc. I came across an article by Bob Stewell \"Do Unhosted Wallets Dream of Network Fees?\". He argues that due to the fact that blockchains do not reward crypto-wallets they are not in a hurry to make a multi-currency crypto-wallet, which are needed for comfortable usage.\n\nHere where I came to understanding why all those problems are happening. For example, I realized why there are huge purchase fees and a bad exchange rate in wallets. We often have to refer to p2p, CEXs, and DEXs just because of it. In case someone out of the crypto world needs to explain how to switch from one currency to another, the disaster is happening. Oh, I guess the support is the main issue here! At the beginning of my crypto way, I was waiting for answers for several days, and as a result, I\u2019ve figured everything out by myself.\n\nEvery time a new blockchain project that is not supported by one or another wallet is released you have to install a specific application. \n\nThere are many places where the wallet is imported via a 12-word seed phrase, and a 24-word seed phrase is often found in new ones ... Is it so difficult to make a choice? And then I found out that these seed phrases may be in different languages! Even in Chinese, and not all wallets support it also! As for me, I have been using cryptocurrencies for more than 5 years now and I see that wallets are developing really slow. It got so bad that I'm already thinking of developing a wallet myself. \n\nBob believes that the problem essence is in the monetization model - wallets live off a percentage of the purchase or exchange. Adding all the variety of blockchains for wallets is resource-intensive, and wallet revenues will not grow much from this. For me as a user, the problem is really serious, since the ecosystems of Ethereum, Cosmos, Solana, Polygon, and others are actively developing, and it is impossible to use them all in one wallet.\n\nFrankly, it is much more natural for a wallet that offers a variety of blockchains to provide a range of payment systems and exchangers. But no one does this, because the more profitable this exchange for the user is, the less the wallet\u2019s profit is, or there is even no profit at all. This is a bad system.\n\nThe problem is in the blockchains themselves: they pay miners, they pay stackers, but they don't pay wallets. It seems to me that blockchains can change this situation and start stimulating wallets, and this will give an impetus to development, and strengthen competition. Wallets will fight each other to become number 1! To make the most convenient and intuitive interface (this is a problem for many wallets). \n\nThe solution is the integration of the mechanism into the blockchain, which will send part of the network transaction fee to the wallet that helped the user to carry out this transaction. Then the functionality and service of wallets will improve significantly. What do you think about it?",

Many of these developers are unpaid and contributing to these projects in their free time. People aren\u2019t constantly working on the code. \n\nSecondly, it takes time for written code to be released as it has to go through review after review with fixes in-between. I can vouch from experience that smaller bug fixes takes around week to be merged into the main code branch and larger feature implementations can span months. And this is good. This is what should be expected of any critical applications and infrastructure code. You could write your own code without having it reviewed but that\u2019s not a development process I, or others, would trust.\n\nThirdly, wallet applications often depend on other lower level libraries to implement the finer details of chain protocols. So wallet applications often have to wait for these lower level libraries to finish implementing the newest chain features and bug fixes before adapting it for end users. There are layers and layers of abstraction for code to reach the end user and wallet apps are only the tippy top. \n\nFurther, the best software is often software that does something of a limited scope very well. Creating a single application that manages multiple cryptocurrencies would not be inline with this. Things get complex real quick. \n\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about the system you proposed. \nI can already think of an exploit. What if a malicious wallet developer decided to spam transactions linked to their wallet in order to reap rewards? What\u2019s stopping them and others from doing this? I can only see your system being abused by malicious parties.\n\nAnd don\u2019t you find it a little unfair that wallet developers can make use of open source libraries to build their app but still rake in the rewards themselves? Where are the rewards for the protocol level and lower level library developers?",

            "selftext": "Interesting White Paper regarding a decentralized social network like twitter. Let me know what you guys think and if this is something that could be accomplished. \n\n# CAW\n\n**A Manifesto on a Decentralized Social Clearing House ...(AKA) CAW**\n\nThe concept of decentralization has been lost to some of us over time, those who forgot why Bitcoin was created, the issues blockchain and cryptocurrency is meant to solve.\n\nTo be decentralized means there is no single person, entity, nor group which has ultimate control nor benefit over a system.\n\nIn a decentralized system, there is not one man who via desire or persuasion could cripple the system in any meaningful way.\n\nThis means from both a technical standpoint (i.e, a developer who can stop trading, or disable the protocol through the use of smart contracts) and a financial one (e.g, an entity who has n+1 (infinite) tokens, and could dump them if they so wished, but decides not to).\n\nThat is not to say that a proper decentralized system is without whales nor its own cornerstones. There are always those that may have a greater affect upon a network, or 'matter' through entropy or their own hard work.\n\nCAW began as nothing, there was no developer, no information, no medium of communication. Simply, a contract.\n\n**Freedom given to the people to discover CAW's meaning amongst themselves.**\n\nThis has gone well, and so we would like to present our specification for the second phase of CAW. But before we do, some things must be said and taken note of:\n\n1. This is a only a specification. It is up to the cawmmunity to write and deploy the protocol.\n2. It is strongly recommended that a peer group is formed to develop and review smart contracts. As there is no leader in this process, all types will attempt to claim ownership of the process. There will those everso helpful who claim to be able to 'do it all' but will write the perfect code with the perfect backdoor. Only a cawmmunity reviewed and accepted contract on a public github will be acceptable.\n3. After deployment, the deployer must renounce any keys they have to the contracts. There will be no multi-sig, no upgradeable proxyies. It will not matter who deployed because they will be equal with all with no specific benefit nor advantage. Just get the contract right.\n\n**We propose:**\n\na. A protocol made up of many on-chain smart contracts for sending messages publicly or p2p with a max character limit of 420.\n\nb. A specification for the frontends, of which many will be made, to interact with this protocol.\n\nThe general function of the protocol and its contracts is as follows:\n\ni. Burn CAW through a contract to mint an NFT. This burned caw will go to 0x0. The NFT will be your username.\n\na. The fewer characters in your username, the higher the cost.\n\nb. Every username is unique, and may use a-z and 0-9, without the use of special characters (emojis, etc..,) or capital letters.\n\nii. All user activity, social and financial flows through their NFT username. Whoever owns this NFT has access to that account. This includes, but is not limited to, their CAW balance and access to that user's direct messages (DMs).\n\niii. Ownership and management of the NFTs will be completely on-chain. For instance, the registration of the username 'cawdev' will be stored directly on-chain, along with all of the data associated.\n\niv. Holding the NFT (note holding, not staking), allows the user to deposit or withdraw CAW into a contract wallet.\n\nThe ownership of the NFT will serve as the key to this wallet. For users using multiple NFTs they may specify which by a unique number associated.\n\n**v. A user may spend CAW in the following way on the protocol.**\n\ni. Making a CAW (Akin to tweeting).\n\na. This cost will be taken in CAW, and then distributed proportionally to all other stakers.\n\nii. Liking someone else's CAW.\n\na. This is closer to tipping. The CAW will be taken and directly sent to the OP (original poster's) wallet.\n\niii. ReCAWing (akin to a retweet).\n\na. The cost of which will be taken in CAW and sent to OP's wallet.\n\nvi. For receiving the CAW we envision a mostly gasless contract, in which signatures may push CAW balance between users and the application in a contract.\n\nThe only thing a user should be spending gas on is:\n\na. The minting of an NFT.\n\nb. Depositing or withdrawing CAW.\n\nvii. DM's should be 'free' and executed via a trustless handshake between two accounts to enable secure peer-to-peer messaging.\n\nGroup chats would bring on unneeded complexity, and are not recommended at this point.\n\nviii. All data will be stored permanently. Due to limitations of the Ethereum network, Arweave or similar blockchains may be preferred.\n\n**The CAW liquidity**\n\n\u2026 may migrate at some point to the QOMQQL1, but that will be addressed once the technical merits reveal itself and the move is obvious.\n\nData storage must be completely trustless, and permanent. The importance of being both censorship resistant and self-policing for the betterment of a protocol cannot be overstated. CAW is meant only to give you the raw tool kit to build your own online society.\n\nBecause of this, there is a distinct gap between the protocol itself, and the frontends.\n\nAt the base level, CAW's contracts for trustless data storage and communication, anything can be posted. We are not naive, and we understand what may be posted.\n\nAs a result of this, it is up to the frontends to limit content that might obfuscate the reason for CAW's creation.\n\n**That being said, at the level of a protocol no username or message will be blocked or quarantined.**\n\nDue to the nature of renounced ownership of smart contracts, there will be nobody who can limit such content. (perhaps now you see why renouncing the contract with no multi-sig or upgrades is important).\n\nNow onto the frontends. Anybody is free to make or host their own frontend which will show whatever they would like (or don't). We expect there will be many along with a goal of a mobile app and browser extension that serves as cawing/wallet and instant messager platform that executes the sigs fast and invisible to give a smoother messaging experience (signing a metamask every time can be tiresome).\n\n**We would recommend that the community makes an alpha frontend, that is more or less 'neutral'.**\n\nIt may filter overt hate/violence, along with hard-illegal activity, remember we need to win the world first.\n\nOthers may have a better idea of what should be shown, and their perogative should be to create and host their own frontend.\n\nThe point being, CAW is like Twitter. Except it is bound by no laws, and no central content moderation.\n\nHowever, the frontends may choose to moderate the content however they like, or must to fit whatever legal guidelines they need to fit.\n\nSo even if one frontend blocks you, you cannot be policed, and are still free to use the protocol itself.\n\n**Appendix.**\n\na. It is fairly obvious individuals will begin buying and selling the NFT usernames.\n\nIt would be wise of a community member to create a trustless and feeless marketplace for such trades, similar to Crypto Punk feeless trades.\n\nThat being said we are pretty aware that as CAW grows to scale, many will still use FEE marketplaces such as opensea and looks.\n\nThis means that the deployer of the contract that mints NFTS will have the technical ability to set themselves fee's from opensea.\n\nWe do not think this is a good thing, and ask the cawmmunity to self police/renounce in order to make sure that trading fees are not set and sent to a private wallet.\n\nIf it helps, this will imply liability for the content posted if your wallet is receiving trading fees\n\nb. Economically, these are the numbers open for debate and structured so that we understand the practical dollar amount of CAW.\n\ni. 50 mln market cap (near or current MC).\n\nii. 1 bln market cap (typical memecoin mooning for a bit MC).\n\niii. 10 bln market cap (SHIB-like).\n\nWe will need to be aware of the realities of what happens as the burn of CAW scales, as we will not be able to change the cost of the protocol once set in motion.\n\n**The necessary cost calculations in CAW are:**\n\ni. Amount of CAW to send CAW (all of which is distributed among stakers).\n\nii. Amount of CAW to like a CAW. (sent to OP).\n\niii. Amount of CAW to reCAW a CAW (distributed amount OP and stakers).\n\niv. Burn amounts for various length'd username NFTs.\n\n**We did quite a bit of math to consider the following numbers, but we may have missed something.**\n\nIt was calculated in such a way that liking, reCAWing, and posting, is always affordable at a market cap of 10 billion, while ensuring that the more rare and shorter usernames remain damn expensive.\n\nThe following is the recommended cost, along with the estimated amount in US Dollars in brackets at the three target MC's (50 mln, 1 bln, 10 bln).\n\n\\- Single Character username (rare!) BURN 1,000,000,000,000 ($89,985, $1,799,712, $17,997,120)\n\n\\- 2 Character username - BURN 240,000,000,000 CAW ($21,600, $432,000, $4,320,000)\n\n\\- 3 Character Username - BURN 60,000,000,000 CAW ($5400, $108,000, $1,080,000)\n\n\\- 4 Character Username - BURN 6,000,000,000 CAW ($540, $10,800 $108,000)\n\n\\- 5 Character username - BURN 200,000,000 CAW ($18, $360, $3600)\n\n\\- 6 Character username - BURN 20,000,000 CAW ($1.80, $36, $360)\n\n\\- 7 Character username -BURN 10,000,000 CAW (90c, $18, $180)\n\n\\- 8 Character and up username - BURN 1,000,000 CAW (9c, $1.80, $18)\n\n\\- Follow an Account (paid 80/20 to account and stakepool) 30000 (na,0.009,9c)\n\n\\- Send a CAW (max xxx Characters) (paid 100 to stakepool) 5000 (na, na, 1.5c)\n\n\\- Like a CAW (paid 80/20 to account and stakepool) 2000 (na,na, $0.007)\n\n\\- ReCAW (paid 50/50 to account and stakepool) 4000 (na,na,1.2c)\n\nc. Image hosting, and management\n\ni. The protocol will have no involvement in the hosting of images. This will be up to the frontends to filter, display, host.\n\nii. It is recommended that frontends render URLs from external sources placed inside posts,\n\nor employ their own URL shortener so URLs do not destroy the character limit on CAW.\n\nFor example if my CAW was ... \"Just had some great fried fish on Point Road with [u/tk420](https://www.reddit.com/u/tk420/) \\#yum #foodie #bestfrens\n\nA frontend should shorten the URL to something like '[https://c.aw/cawdev](https://c.aw/cawdev)' prior to the users post, and automically render the URL as a snippet.\n\nLove, one who still dreams.\n\n**P.S.**\n\nP.S. There are no official socials, nor partner projects or further releases.\n\nCAW is by design without design, and it is up the CAWMmunity to shape CAW.\n\nOnly by giving you the vision and seeing what comes next may we have a truly free and decentralized system.",

IMO this is not a good idea, because it means each user will have to pay to post something, and even if the cost is 1c or less, the user will have to maintain some small crypto wallet to use it. 99% of the world isn't ready to do this in 2022. Also all blockchains have theoretical throughput limits, even L2s and new blockchains like Solana couldn't handle 1% of Twitter traffic, even if it's text only (no media).\n\nI am working on a decentralized p2p reddit alternative that doesn't use blockchain, rather it uses a network similar to bittorrent, where peers store and seed their own data and the data they consume, but not the entire network, so it can scale infinitely, and doesn't require any cryptocurrency to post.

I would say most of us in this sub are more liberal minded, as in we want ultimate freedom. We want our bill of rights, we want all of our computer programs to be open source, we want to be in charge of our own fate, and it\u2019s easy to bring this mindset into a social media but there\u2019s a few problems with this. If the website doesn\u2019t comply with laws then the user base will only be a small group of motivated tech types and it will never reach the masses like Facebook or it\u2019s competition. You need a lot of employees to not only take off illegal content like child porn and gore, but to make sure the website complies with laws going forward. Sure you can make a website that is technically decentralized and is like social media, but it will be probably be more of a forum than a social media. \n\nWhere do you get the money to pay people to regulate content? Where do you get the money to pay for the website? If the website isn\u2019t legal, which it won\u2019t be if it was actually decentralized, you won\u2019t get advertisers which is damn near 100% of all social media platforms income. \n\nCurrent blockchains, especially with smart contracts like what will be needed for something like you\u2019re saying is expensive and someone needs to pay for it. Users will never pay to post content. Users need to be incentivized to post, not asked for money every time they want to add data to the blockchain.",
