                            "response": ">how do I self host\n\nHi MrRGnome, you cannot self-host this/there is no public repo. I believe [lntxbot](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lntxbot) is configurable to use on discord if you seek a self-hosted option.\n\nPublishing the code for this bot provides only negatives for me I'm afraid. There is no way to prove to any of my users that the code they see on github is the code that I am running so what good does auditing the code do? If I didn't intend to host the bot and grow its audience I would publish the code so other people can host it as you suggest. However, I believe publishing the code only exposes me/my users to loss of funds by allowing malicious actors to hunt for vulnerabilities & bugs in the code. For example, someone [stole](https://twitter.com/lntxbot/status/1457054454251917314) 14 million sats from lntxbot at the end of last year. Having access to the lntxbot's source, I imagine would only assist in an attack like this.\n\nLet me be clear about this DiscoPay is fully custodial. Users should not keep more than a few thousand sats on the bot. Luckily lightning makes withdrawal and deposits basically free and instant so this is not a big burden for users. Lastly, to further encourage users to keep a minimal amount of funds on the bot I'm releasing a, feature hopefully by the end of the week, that enables auto withdrawals to lnurl pay & lightning addresses once your balance exceeds a user-specified threshold.",

Easiest is just to use a mobile wallet app.\n\nAs another example (assuming you don't have an account at some exchange like Coinbase, Kraken, etc), you can generate a paper wallet on your computer and just provide him the public address.  If you do that, make sure you keep the private key completely hidden (\\*\\*\\* do not even store it on your computer, just save it to a removable drive you keep offline and/or print the hard copy & store it in a safe.  Do not ever expose the private key to anyone).  Once he sends funds to your public wallet address, you can see the funds by checking any blockchain explorer (eg. [blockchair.com](https://blockchair.com) or [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info), etc), and whenever you want to send funds you can just use a mobile wallet app to scan/import the private key.",
