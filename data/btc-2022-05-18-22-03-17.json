That's what you are asking for after all... yeah, that comes with more regulation.\n\nYou've offered polar arguments here. Ifinex being fully transparent from the beginning would have avoided the doubt in people's minds, which you've extended to the 'regulation'.\n\n>Also as for the collapse of Tether bringing on the \"days of BCH\"...

You're all bitching about it because none of you are able and willing to do anything about it.\n\nOnly thing that will make that happen is more stringent regulation on stablecoins and crypto in general. It's not a polar argument, it's a simple fact. \"oh Tether is bad, they need to do the right thing\" lmao... Are you a child. Ask your parents what the air was like in the 70s...until the EPA actually implemented the Air Quality Act no one did anything for the environment. Human greed is infinite without consequences.\n\nI honestly don't give a shit what resonates with you... Because apparently reality isn't something you \"jive\" with.\n\nYou want to fix crypto? You need regulation... You want crypto to succeed, then BTC has to be the leader of that. Simple as it is of a concept, some of you just don't get it",
