And then when they inevitably get locked out by the 2FA failures, they lose access to their coins. And there\u2019s no support to speak of.\n\nSearch here for \u2018text wallet\u2019 and have a read.\n\nThere are a number of ways to generate wallets.\n\nFor singles, coinb.in will do that. And since you want to grab a copy of the site anyway, you can do this offline.\n\nWalletgenerator.net will do bulk batches of thousands or even more. Which is a good move, since there have been concerns raised about the security of the site from time to time. Just run off a few thousand and put them on ice till you need them\n\nYou always spin up a fresh copy of Core, let it generate its files, and then use the DUMPWALLET command to create a text file with all your wallets in it. A hundred of them by default. And there\u2019s no need to sync the client first either. Just throw it away when you\u2019re done\n\nYou can even use https://privatekeys.pw/keys/dogecoin/1192823076327875903496734298758521961826531160253833807780858347507850668059 to get some wallets. Just be sure to hit the random button a few times first. And again, let them mellow like fine wine.",

If the exchange chooses to not pay you back, they won't pay you back. \n\nFeel free to make the experience yourself but do not cry that you haven't been warned when it's gone.\n\nEven at 10% a year it would take you 7 years to double your money and during those 7 years you always have a risk of a 100% loss..
