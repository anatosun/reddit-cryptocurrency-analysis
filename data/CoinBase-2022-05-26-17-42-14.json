Someone transfered ETH to my wallet and then took al my Shib and 2 days after  like $2 worth of BNB. I have not done anything even though I still have more funds because I am trying to figure put how they got my Phrase or access to my wallet. I noticed a coin name Anti inus dropped there in December but never did anything with it. And the only place I have connected a wallet was Star Atlas.
