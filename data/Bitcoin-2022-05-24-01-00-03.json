That is, the new block's header contains a value in prev_block_hash for either block-A or block-B  \n\nLet's say block-C follows block-B. Block-C is propagated to every node. The nodes with block-A at their tips will see that block-C's prev_block_hash does not match the block-A header hash. At this point the block-A node knows that there has been a tip fork. The node requests its neighbors to send block-B (identifying it using block-C's prev_block_hash). The node replaces block-A with block-B, marks block-A as stale, and does some associated mempool housekeeping  \n\nMore detail, including diagrams in Mastering Bitcoin  \nhttps://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch10.asciidoc  \n\nSearch down to \"Blockchain Forks\"",

While those predictions haven't yet come to pass, the rise of crypto assets has rekindled the debate. These assets may one day serve as alternative means of payment and, possibly, units of account, which would reduce the demand for fiat currencies or central bank money. It's time to revisit the question, will monetary policy remain effective in a world without central bank money(Woodford 2000)?",

The bonds that the Federal Reserve purchases kind of act the way you describe but they are technically not the government so it is interest going to a different entity.\n\nBut when the fed does this to manipulate interest rates, it changes how hard/easy it is to issue higher value mortgages (which changes how much debt banks create out of nothin).\n\nThose banks then get paid back over time with interest. When it\u2019s all said and done, they delete the \u201cdebt\u201d money and keep the \u201cinterest\u201d money. However, that money is often coming from other mortgage debt\u2013meaning that debt is growing faster than it is being deleted upon repayment.\n\nThis results in A) housing prices going up forever on average B) the Federal Reserve being forced to keep low interest rates or else risk crashing the banks to the point of insolvency.\n\nSo the Fed frees up banks to over leverage mortgage debts which in turn forces the fed to free up banks to over leverage mortgage debts\u2026 so the fed owns an increasing number of total bonds, more bonds keep getting issued, government debt keeps growing, and bank issued debt keeps growing.\n\nI think that about covers it but probably not \ud83d\ude02",

The only way this infinite debt growth could be sustainable longterm would be if inflation grew GDP (and therefore tax revenue) at the same rate as the debt grew. But surpassing GDP is only possible if that is not the case.\n\nAt some point, debt grows so large that tax revenue is completely crushed by servicing the debt. That will be the end of the US dollar. Fortunately/unfortunately that is much further away than Bitcoiners think. That said, we are clearly on our way there and Bitcoin will hopefully grow large enough before that happens.",

Understandable, because it's complicated as shit.\n\nBut the way the Federal Reserve works with the Treasury to \"print\" money is actually issuing (i.e. printing) debt\u2013which looks and behaves exactly like money. So they can create new debt to service the old debt, but obviously this just means you have more debt to service the next time around.\n\nThe only way to actually shrink this is to service (and pay down) the total debt with tax revenue directly. So we would at minimum need to shrink our spending to < 98% of tax revenue (assuming interest rates are *actually* 2%) just to be making a tiny bit of progress towards paying down the debt.\n\nWe either face 1) A debt spiral or 2) decades of underfunded government programs, insolvency of social security, etc.\n\nThe best way to get out of this is to move citizens onto a new money (Bitcoin) before either option is taken.",
