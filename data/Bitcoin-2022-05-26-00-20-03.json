            "selftext": "I am loving the technology and positive concepts behind use of Bitcoin. I really do think that it has a bright future and am excited to see where it\u2019ll go and how/to what degree it\u2019ll get widely incorporated into societies around the world.\n\nA couple of questions have crept up in my mind when thinking about the possible barriers for bitcoin\u2019s success. I just wanted to ask your thoughts about it.\n\n1. To what degree of adoption and daily regular use by the general public would need to be achieved? My impression is that the vast majority of people who buy Bitcoin are treating it like an investment and are not really adopting it for it\u2019s true original intended purpose/use as a currency. I think we CAN (and some of us DO) use it as a currency. But I think that the majority of people are just investing in it as stored value. And we\u2019re just kinda passing the responsibility of adopting it as a currency to others or drawing hypotheticals about \u201cthe future\u201d and hypothesizing that the majority of people in the future will start using it as currency. But it just feels like the vast majority of bitcoin holders aren\u2019t spending it or utilizing it as currency. What are the steps to achieve that or promote more widespread utility? Do we as investors share a big responsibility in trying to use Bitcoin as currency?\n\n2. In an ideal perfect world there won\u2019t be any situations where theft happens. But the truth is that it can certainly happen (and will happen to some people). Are there any ways to protect against loss or fraud? It seems like a double edged sword: your cold storage wallet is extremely secure, but if it somehow gets compromised- your bitcoins are just completely gone with no way to get them back. Sure we need to stress the importance of always protecting our keys, and ideally the keys will never be compromised. But what if it does get compromised? Is it really that smart to have you life savings in a variety of wallets that can be potentially wiped clean with no recourse for recovery of the stolen bitcoins? Or do you think there will be an establishment of \u201cbitcoin\u201d banks in a way that offer certain deferment of responsibility, guarantees, with protections, insurance or security? Doesn\u2019t that just become the same concept of current traditional banks that we have now for our fiat currency?\n\nAppreciate any insight you guys can offer me. Looking forward to seeing where bitcoin goes in its journey!",

You \"feel\" like you understand it, but your understanding is not correct in places, and has some big \"holes\" in other places.  \n\n> \n> there won\u2019t be any situations where theft happens.

This is not hypothetical; this is very real.",

Some decide to treat it as an investment and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, there\u2019s plenty satoshis to go around and be used however the user wants to. I would buy with BTC if it was more accessible. I do my part and accept it as payment for my services.\n\nAs for security.. The only way for your keys to be compromised is if you\u2019re not vigilant and click on links you shouldn\u2019t. There\u2019s scams with fiat as well, just don\u2019t be stupid. Irreversible transactions is one of the perks of crypto imo. As adoption grows, more security means are going to emerge but it is most likely that common folks will keep their coins on non custodial wallets such as exchanged or whatever so their coins are \u00ab\u00a0insured\u00a0\u00bb. This is not how it\u2019s meant to be but then again, it\u2019s a free market and you do whatever you feel confident with. I know for a fact nobody can take my coins because I use a hardware wallet and everybody should do the same.",

Last time natural gas and oil moved at this price range was in 2007, therefor most individuals have no money to spend and struggle with the increase in prices .  In conclusion, If you believe in bitcoin , Its a great time to use the store of value characteristics !\n\n2: You can diversify your risk and If you really don't trust your capacity and desire an old fashion type bank , there's the possibility of using multisig where you could decide a plan with your \"bank\". Really you want to make it so new generations learn the core concept of **don't trust, verify !**     I don't think they'll accept the same bull\\*\\*\\* this time, and won't let anyone or institutions have full control of any bitcoin if you don't own it.\n\n( **Not financial advice**, humble opinion from a Electrophorus electricus)",
