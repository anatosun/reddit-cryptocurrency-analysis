You will know for sure that the collapse happened when BCH and XMR trade in the 5 figure range.\n\nWhat you can do to fasten this process is withdraw all your BCH and XMR from CEX (cryptobanks) and make as many people as possible aware of this situation. Else you can sell USDT for USD in Kraken and see what happens. This is the only pair where you can tarde USDT for \"real\" USD. And they are heavily manipulating it. But where there is manipulation there is potential gain.\n\nThere will be Monerorun 2 on June 8th (tail emission day). I'd like to see the BCH community join forces with the Monero community.",

So, in some small effect, the blocker is able to remove you from conversations with others, as well.\n\nI found this out last week. After a poor (mostly my fault) interaction with /u/br0kenrabbittv , they blocked me. I was going to interact with someone within a post br0ken had created, to find out that I could not reply to anyone within that thread. If memory serves, I had located a bot/ai account and wanted to report it, but could not due to br0ken's block. I could be misremembering though.\n\nEdit: I seems that reddit, in their infinite wisdom, has created a \"safe space\" for those that are offended.

We've never interacted \"on a business level\" and I highly doubt we ever will. \n\n**Re: Manipulation** (I had thought to edit my previous comment, but decided, after seeing your latest comment, to just include the below here)\n\nThere is only one person attempting to manipulate here, and that is you.\n\nOn 4/23/2022, 11:08:09 AM you stated:\n\n> [I have to say that some of the earners at Purse are ideological.  If you're not among the \"woke\" your goods may arrive damaged or you may have some other problems.](https://camas.unddit.com/#{%22author%22:%22-ism-isa-con%22,%22subreddit%22:%22btc%22,%22resultSize%22:500,%22query%22:%22Purse%20are%20ideological%22})\n\n(1) When I called you out on that ridiculous conclusion, you deleted your comment. Trying to hide what you had said, attempting to manipulate the narrative to make yourself seem more reasonable than you actually were/are.\n\n(2) Your comment was/is obviously derived from your one poor experience. \n\n(3) I pointed out, in that original conversation thread what I believed to be logical inconsistencies and utter unreasonableness.\n\nThen on 4/25/2022, 9:07:54 AM\n\nYou made [your comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ub6w9c/alternatives_to_purseio/i65945u/), where you explain your one poor experience with Purse. Throughout that explanation you never once informed the readers what your actual expectations were. \n\nDue to that lack of that specific information, the subsequent conversation, and my pessimism; I concluded (but did not specifically state) that you were/are an unreasonable sort of person. Over the course of 24 hours we had multiple interactions in that conversation. \n\nMy last comment was on 4/25/2022, 11:13:19 PM\n\nThen you waited 12 days to continue the conversation. \n\nDuring that 12 day time period, on 5/12/2022, 6:21:50 PM [you made a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/uo5xo9/one_month_ago_i_predicted_the_collapse_of_luna/i8e8v1l/), in a wholly unrelated thread, about me, without pinging me so I could have the opportunity to respond; another manipulation tactic. You attempted to associate me with \"**scammers, generally unethical people, and even political actors.**\" and accused me of \"haranguing\" you, so as to create a narrative of your victim-hood.\n\nYour [original comment](https://camas.unddit.com/#{%22author%22:%22-ism-isa-con%22,%22resultSize%22:500,%22query%22:%22There%20are%20also%20a%20lot%20of%20scammers,%20generally%20unethical%20people,%20and%20even%20political%20actors.%22}) did not include your reference to me. \n\n\nOn 5/8/2022, 1:33:53 AM [you resume the conversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ub6w9c/alternatives_to_purseio/i7ryx51/): you attempt to create the allusion that I am a representative of Purse, so as to continue your manipulation of your chosen narrative. \n\nI waited to respond until 5/18/2022, 6:55:22 PM. At that time I was fed up with your manipulation tactics, so I chose to minimize my engagement and just draw any other reader's attention to your behavior.\n\nThen on 5/18/2022, 9:24:24 PM you create another comment, [original here](https://camas.unddit.com/#{%22author%22:%22-ism-isa-con%22,%22resultSize%22:500,%22query%22:%22Always%20interesting%20when%20someone%20pretends%20to%20be%20talking%20to%20you,%20but%20they%20are%20really%20talking%20to%20other%20people.%20%22}). \n\nNow, you're here, in another thread, attempting to manipulate the narrative. Again alluding to me being a representative of Purse. \n\nI'm going to stop now, as I do not wish to continue interacting with someone (you, /u/-ism-isa-con ) I believe to be bat shit crazy. <Rolls eyes> ya, purse.io earners purposefully damaged the thing you ordered, even though they never once touched it. JFC you're insane.",

The reason I think it is a good idea is because it stops persistent trolls from following you around into other subs etc.. and commenting on all your stuff. Recently a guy was banned from a sub I control by me, so he then went on to start trying to carry the argument on in topics I had made in other subs, as soon as he made the first comment in another sub, I blocked the user which completely shut it down and stopped him being able to continue his bullshit.\n\nIt's not a perfect system, but if I'm not mistaken the old system was even worse and allowed people to still follow you around posting under your content, it was like a soft block and useless.",
