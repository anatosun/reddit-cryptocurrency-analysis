The proof is in comparing\n\nGold vs Silver\n\nversus\n\nBTC vs ETH\n\nIf BTC were really gold, its market cap should be approx **10x** ETH (silver), instead it's only **2.5x**. Therefore Peter Schiff is the one telling the truth: the crypto \"community\" can just flip the gold for silver, dumping the gold on Salvadorans who are too primitive to understand smart contracts.\n\nWhat El Salvador could (or should) have done was embedded gold into polymer cash ([Cash Gold](https://ebay.com/itm/164961330561)). With XRF, it's a **decentralized gold standard**, and the Salvadoran gold notes would set the international standard, with ppl from all over the world paying a premium for Salvadoran currency, to use locally on their own land. Anyone can print the cash, and it has the same value, as long as it passes a standard X-Ray test, the same as a Bitcoin node test. Without gold cash backing it, Schiff could argue that Bitcoin just looks like a Ponzi.",
