            "selftext": "Alright so on the 13th I bought some AVAX. It about $840 worth. It was a limit order with USD that was already on my account. So, I got filled right away for 100%. But the AVAX never became available. So, I can't set stop losses or if it shoots up nothing i can do. Ive spent hours talking to customer service and all i get is passed on by them saying the need to push it over to someone else because that dont have that control. Last Lady said email support will contact me and figure it out. They contacted me and its been over 24hrs and nothing back. My balance shows correct on my account but the Coin is not in my assets. Ill post a couple screen shots. Kinda getting a little fishy, my screen shots  will some cash in USDC now, because i converted it to be able to move my money to FTX. I cant move the rest because it was  recent. So Sadly couldn't move all my money. Some weirdddd stuff here. With coinbase being as big as it is and regulated this kinda stuff should never happen to the investor or at least for this long. \n\n [Corey None | Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/195637812@N03/)",
