I appreciate your time and thank you for the pointers. I just don't have the time to watch so closely when I get the itch. Usually I itch after lack of support lasts a couple days or more, and I catch it still struggling. Not the most scientific I know but really my patience with all of the specs runs out pretty fast and as a small bit player, it just doesn't hurt too bad. Over the term of my hold it will get washed away. Ive only sold twice, once to dump Robinhood (lucked into a dip when I got Coinbase sorted), then I pushed everything into Exodus. On research, I sold everything before we moved to Luxembourg, and I lucked into another even deeper dip when I bought back in once I had a Lux bank to load from. I limit bought a few times in the early days but since I got here, ive only bought twice at market. Ill hit a few more times as fast as I can just to get up to 20k. If levels hold close to here, ill be in at 20k level for less than my first 10k cost me. Not pumping and dumping or anything, just had to sell and got back in as soon as I could.",
