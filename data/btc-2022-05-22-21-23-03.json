Some will be humble, some will be cocky. But as long as they don't spread misinformation, or troll you there is no reason to downvote them. \n\nWe need to get out of the trenches and educate :) The arguments are on our side, now more then ever.

Not everyone that just learned about Bitcoin is a maxi. I'd rather give maxis the benefit of the doubt if it means we have the opportunity to talk to people and let them know how passionate we are about BCH. \n\nNobody, and I mean NOBODY responds well to getting yelled at. So maybe don't be so eager to vent your frustrations and turn someone that *might* have become a BCH convert into a BTC maxi. \n\nBut hey, I bet it felt really good to yell at a stranger on the internet.   \nGood job r/btc.",
