And while the trilemma seems like it\u2019s very perplexing and hard to solve, it will eventually get solved by someone if we keep up this pace.\n\nMy question is, how would L2s and scaling solutions react?  \nA large number of the top 20 coins on the market are L2s and scaling solutions like Polkadot, Polygon, Avalanche aside from the many other scaling solutions that fall below the top 20 list.\n\nAll of these projects would technology be rendered obsolete if an L1 solved the trilemma and will slowly fade into obscurity. So I\u2019m pretty sure they won\u2019t go without a fight.\n\nThere are some L1s that are pretty close to solving the trilemma right now most prominent of which would be Cardano but their ecosystem is a bit dry right now and could use some more development. Another one would be Hedera especially now that Hbar foundation is allocating hundreds of million if dollars to allegedly make Hedera the most well rounded and capable L1 on the market.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long it will take for an L1 to prove itself capable of solving the trilemma but I\u2019m pretty sure we arent too far away from that day.\n\nHopefully when that day comes scaling solutions wont take a hard hit cause they\u2019re a big part of the market right now so it would affect the market negative for a short while.",

I don\u2019t give a ship about any crypto personally. \nBut the best layer 1\u2019s to invest in are Solana, near protocol, avax, and atom. Solana and near is probably all I will have next bull run. Eth is overvalued and slow. Layer 2\u2019s are stupid. No regular people want to use that shit. I would not buy Cardano under any circumstance. Kda is good and can 30x next bull run, but runs on Haskell which is garbage. So if does 30x is based on speculation heavy instead of using. Devs hate Haskell which Cardano uses too.",
