            "selftext": "The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) also shared a promise to \"compensate the remaining UST users, smallest holders first,\" with the remaining assets.\n\nHowever, there is no record of any re-purchase, compensation or token burning on Terra to restore part of the price, a system inspired by Shiba Inu, Axs or Minosis Token, a system that has been effective.\n\nIn short, 80,081 Bitcoin (BTC) or 99.61% of the bitcoins that LFG held in custody, have left the fund. The group confirmed the sale of \"33,206 BTC for a total of $1,164,018,521 $UST\" in a tweet. The remaining 47,188 BTC are unaccounted for, while 313 BTC remain in reserve.\n\nInterestingly, LFG has not sold a single Binance Coin (BNB) or Avalanche (AVAX), holding around 40,000 and 2,000,000 of each token, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrency enthusiasts with staking LUNA tokens should see LUNA returned to their wallets in the next 20 days. However, it will be worth less: LUNA's price has fallen more than 99% from its highs, and currently sits at $0.0002.\n\nWhat was once a $50 billion ecosystem now has a total reserve balance of $82 million, prompting popular influencer Cobie to simply respond to the thread with, \"Bruh.\"",

Not good at all",
