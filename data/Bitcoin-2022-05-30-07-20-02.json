A similar program as El Salvador offering investors residency and zero income and CG taxes is being proposed. There are people with considerable Bitcoin capital looking for jurisdictions where they will be encouraged and able to develop Bitcoin based business models. If this can succeed it would demonstrate an alternative to the many other nations languishing under the current fiat institutional structures that have failed these countries in most cases. CAR has incredible wealth in natural resources but has not had the support structures in place to realise that wealth to benefit its people - instead those natural resources have been extracted by foreign powers and the CAR people and infrastructure left in ruins. What do such countries have to lose by trying an alternative now offered by the El Salvador model of freeing themselves from the IMF and World banks which are subservient to imperialist governments and corporates?",

Your bad faith argument is based on a false equivalence- effectively diversion from the facts and issues raised.\n\nPrior to 1971 people could still save money in the bank and earn interest higher than the rate of inflation. This gave people the incentive to save and incentive not to take on unnecessary debt.\n\nPost the neoliberal monetarist deregulation of the banking sector that followed abandoning the gold standard in 1971 commercial banks were allowed to advance fiat debt finance toward any purpose, not just productive investments. This has seen a massive increase in the issuance of fiat debt finance toward non productive assets (mostly housing) and an equally massive reduction in the proportion of fiat debt finance toward productive purposes and infrastructure. This has increased the cost of housing and reduced the strength of the productive economy, causing both chronic trade deficits and inflation. The economy has thus been a mongrel hybrid of Keynesian and Monetarist dogma, an expedient and fundamentally dysfunctional and hypocritical mongrel that only serves parasitic debt leveraged speculators and bankers and comes at the expense of everyone else.\n\nBitcoin fixes this by restoring hard money and the incentives to save and have some security and hope, rather than slavery to debt.",

Under bitcoin, we know the inflation is the payment the miners receive for securing the blockchain, and the amount is perfectly predictable.  Whereas the fed had been engaging in pumping asset prices for political reasons (homeowners are the biggest voting block), and there is no one record of where all this money is coming from, where its going, or how much there is.",

Please define inflation first, so that we know what you are referring to.  \n\nHere is my take, deflation leads to people only spending what they absolutely have to, no one is going to starve themselves to death because they are expecting the currency to moon, they might eat the minimum required for their needs, but not less.  Investments will still be made in profitable businesses, rather than inflation pushing money into unprofitable businesses.  Do you have a specific error in my thinking to point to?",

This cannot be blamed entirely on Fiat Money, but is aggravated by entrenched poverty and feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness in many cases due to multiple causes. One cause is Fiat Money which has substantially reduced peoples financial independence by making saving extremely difficult while debt (slavery) has been made increasingly inevitable. The fiat debt slavery cartel has enslaved billions of citizens and most governments. Bitcoin can fix this sense of powerlessness and restores the incentives to Save and thereby restores and a sense of security and hope.",

It just requires a bit of a shift in our thinking. Future generations will understand easily but we\u2019ll probably sound like our grandparents who talk about inflation and how cheap things use to be. We\u2019ve recently seen the significant declines in flat screen TVs, solar panels, and other products due to productivity increases. I think no one would argue that\u2019s bad. Bitcoin is essentially infinitely divisible so as long as people could provide a valuable service they\u2019d be able to get paid in Bitcoin. I disagree that hard money created income inequality. The current system does that. Due to the constant money printing, people are forced to invest in assets to persevere wealth. Heaven forbid you need those funds during a downturn. Financial assets keep going up while the price of goods for average Americans goes up faster than their wages. Many of these average Americans cant put significant funds into financial assets like the stock market and real estate which has created massive income inequality. I think the top 10% own like 95% of financial assets. We didn\u2019t see this income inequality when we were on the gold standard. We\u2019ve learned that no government can be trusted and that\u2019s why we need a rule based system like Bitcoin.  Bitcoin will be the greatest advocate for income equality our word has ever seen. Yes, early adopters will see a large transfer of wealth to them at first.",
