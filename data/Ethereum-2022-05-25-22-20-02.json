I would love to hear some opinion on this project!\n\n\n\u2010---\u2010---------------------\nThe technology\n\nPantos is based on ground-breaking research in the fields of oracles, relays, smart contracts and blockchain efficiency.\n\n\n\n\"The vision of Pantos is to establish the first true Multi-Blockchain Token System. Acting as a layer zero network built on top of all major blockchains.\n\nThe Pantos team at Bitpanda partnered with researchers from renowned technical universities, TU Hamburg (Germany) and TU Wien (Austria) to co-develop the innovative Pantos technology. As a scientific project, we are proud to be pioneers in this field and being able to shape the future of asset tokenisation.\"\n\n\n\n---------\u2010------------------\n\nhttps://pantos.io/en/technology",

Or will we have to connect to different L2s depending on the dapp we want to interact with?\n\nFor example, if a friend of mine starts using a loopring wallet and I use an argent wallet, will I ever be able to send ETH to his wallet?  Or were L2s never designed to interact that way.\n\nThanks,",

An example of this is likely to happen in the GameStop wallet. You may be able to store your tokens on the Loopring protocol, but buy NFTs from a marketplace built by immutable x on stark ex with the tokens on the loopring protocol. The NFT will show up in your GameStop wallet, but you never have to bridge the token or the NFT. The wallet will have smart contracts built in to do that for you. It may not be that way at launch, but that\u2019s the type of functionality we will see with these dapps on various zk protocols.",
