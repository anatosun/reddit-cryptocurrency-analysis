After watching the invent answers youtube channel, I was inspired to make a pretty accurate guestimate of where you would fall based on how much bitcoin you own.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nYou can download the spreadsheet below:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-1TXSqs9p4woFLgg-FRhFN1dBrMNAc84LRGxmKt96j8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-1TXSqs9p4woFLgg-FRhFN1dBrMNAc84LRGxmKt96j8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How does it work?\n\n\\*\\***Note all sources listed at bottom of this post**\\*\\*\n\nHere are the formulas for each cell below if you wanted to run this calculation yourself.\n\n\\- **Bitcoin (sats)**: \\[?\\] Enter the total amount of bitcoin you own in sats\n\n\\- **World Population**: \\[7.753 billion\\] Currently sourced this value from a basic google search\n\n\\- **Unreachable Bitcoin**: \\[2,780,000\\] Currently sourced from a study done by chain analysis (i decided to use the more conservative estimate on lost coins\n\n\\- **Bitcoin Supply cap**: \\[21,000,000\\] We all know what this is\n\n\\- **Locked up Bitcoin**: \\[2,605,999\\] This number was sourced from the satoshi lockup (1,040,000 coins) as well as the current total amount of bitcoin locked up by public and private companies as well as nation-states (1,565,999 coins). The assumption here is that this bitcoin will be locked away from retail investors for a significant amount of time.\n\n\\- **Total bitcoin available**: \\[15,614,001\\] This is calculated via\n\n(***total-supply -*** *(****unreachable-coins*** *+* ***locked-coins****))*\n\n\\- **Sats per person**: \\[201,393.02\\] This was calculated via\n\n*((****available-coins*** *\\* 100,000,000)  /* ***world-population****)*\n\nAbove we take the total available bitcoins and convert them into satoshis, then divide that evenly by the total global population giving us the maximum amount of satoshis per person on earth.\n\n\\- **% of people w/ >= my stash**: \\[0.719%\\] This was calculated via\n\n*(((****available-coins*** *\\* 100,000,000) /* ***my-bitcoin-in-sats****) /* ***world-population***)\n\n*The raw excell formula would be:*\n\n*= IF( (((****available-coins*** *\\* 100,000,000) /* ***my-bitcoin-in-sats****) /* ***world-population***) >= 1, 1, (((***available-coins*** *\\* 100,000,000) /* ***my-bitcoin-in-sats***) / ***world-population***))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe do this because if you own less than the minimum sats per person globally the rank percentage would be > 100, this prevents that.\n\nThe formula above calculates the percentage of people in the world who can own the same amount or more bitcoin than you. This is done by assuming that at a minimum, if everyone else on the planet divided evenly the same amount of bitcoin that you own how many people would be able to measure up to that. This is a cool stat if you want to see what percentile of wealth you are in or if you are in the top 1% of bitcoin holders globally (*hint: it doesn't take much to be in the 1% globally*).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **World Rank**: \\[55,764,289\\] This was calculated via\n\n*(****wealth-percentile*** *\\** ***world-population****)*\n\nFinally, we get our ranking, in this example just owning ***0.28btc*** puts you well within the top 1% as well as the ***55,764,289th*** richest person in the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Why do we need this?\n\nThis formula above stresses the true rareness of bitcoin. Until I came up with this model I didn't truly understand how rare bitcoin is. Oftentimes in media and from influencers, we hear about the 21 million coins available for people to buy before it's gone.  However, this couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, the model described in this post leans toward a more conservative approach to calculating its rarity and could be updated to use chain-analysist's other estimate which is nearly 4 million bitcoin being lost which would make the asset even rarer.\n\nThis model also can somewhat gamify the idea of \"stacking sats\" and make it more entertaining to want to obtain more while booting the ego as well  [\ud83d\ude0e](https://emojipedia.org/smiling-face-with-sunglasses/).\n\n# \n\n# The \"there's always tomorrow fallacy\"\n\nOne too many times have I heard from friends and family members about the \"high price\" of bitcoin. And while at the time of writing a 29k bitcoin price is in fact expensive. People often miss the concept that there will come a time in the near future (assuming bitcoin hyper adoption) where no matter how rich you are you won't be able to ever own a whole coin or maybe even a half.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope you all enjoy,\n\nHODL, HODL!\n\n# Sources\n\n\\- Locked bitcoin in nation-states & corporations:\n\n[https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/treasuries/#etfs](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/treasuries/#etfs)\n\n\\- Lost Bitcoin:\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/08/bitcoins-lost-coins-are-worth-the-price/](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/08/bitcoins-lost-coins-are-worth-the-price/)",
