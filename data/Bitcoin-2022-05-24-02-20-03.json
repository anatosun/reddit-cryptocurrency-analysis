It's hard to sell something if you have to advertise it with a competitors name first...\n\n>Bitcoin is not the structural backbone of all that is blockchain, you have it backwards.\n\nEvery single piece of software written based on the Bitcoin code was written with insider knowledge/understanding of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the structural backbone of an internet of money, in the same way that SMTP/POP is for an internet of ideas in the same way that TCP/IP is structural for all the above...\n\nShow me the alternative to TCP - here's a top google result for you:\n\n[https://www.quora.com/Is-there-an-alternative-to-the-TCP-IP-model-that-does-not-utilize-the-Internet-Protocol-IPv4-6](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-an-alternative-to-the-TCP-IP-model-that-does-not-utilize-the-Internet-Protocol-IPv4-6)\n\nLook at that history and you'll see why I think this way of Bitcoin - Once these technologies (in a way, discoveries) were on the table- their core principals/code didn't leave us.\n\nFrom the start, those alternative projects intended to compete with Bitcoin, as \"better gold\", with VC backing, CEOs, value propositions, more centralized ownership / control... etc\n\n>Before you think I'm a shill, I bought at 38, I bought at 31, I bought at 29, I bought at 28.

Sure, some of SMTP relies on TCP/IP but back to intellectual honesty - If we're discussing the global adoption of technologies, I think it's perfectly reasonable to compare them and recognize similarities and in particular, their adoption trends and histories ... SMTP/POP supports the expression of ideas over the net, and in this sense, Bitcoin will likely support the expression of value ... for millions it already has/does.",
