I know that there should probably be a class action against them for the way they hold people's funds after suspending withdrawals, their automated system hit me with a failed deposit flag, twice, but my bank records clearly show they received both deposits. The debt they claim I owed has already been paid, and still, they have held my funds for over a month without letting me withdraw, these fuckers are criminals. CZ is a scumbag as well, if you listen to the guy talk he his pompous as hell and thinks he is holier than thou.",

Then they wanted something to prove it was my address even though my license proves it.\nThey then want to know my annual income, my net worth and then want proof but don't show examples of how I can prove it.\n\nAll this just so I can deposit fiat.
