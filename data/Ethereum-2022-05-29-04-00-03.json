One way to solve it could be to introduce the concept of \"activated\" and \"not activated\" addresses. One would \"activate\" an address by sending any amount out from that address (or by sending 0 ETH from the address to itself). And then let the wallet (or the blockchain) prevent anyone from sending money to a \"not activated\" address. That would make it impossible to send money to an address for which nobody has the keys (or at least have had the keys at some point :) )",
