At the time of writing, a simple transfer of ETH from address to address is $1.04. The decrease in fees was reflected in the income of Ethereum miners, which also fell to mid-summer 2021 levels.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Of course, this landscape is changing but will take a lot of time IMO because Ethereum is by far the most decentralized and secure smart contract blockchain with a very mature developer ecosystem. Their scalability is being solved by rollups which also support solidity.  \nIn fact, Other Blockchains are launching their EVM-based blockchains ex: Aurora on Near, Moonbeam on Polkadot etc.",
