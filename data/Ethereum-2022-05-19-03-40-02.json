It may go up and down\r\nalong the way but you know at the end of the day it's the right way for future income. Not to\r\nmention the ETH reflections you gain by holding. Reflections are like dividends. They are\r\nbased on 6% of the trading volume which is equally distributed among every holder.\r\nPersonal experience tells me it beats any interest rate you pay at the bank.",
