It just so happens it\u2019s fundamentals (135 B and yearly growth rate) make it suitable as a currency use.\n\nCrypto is about escaping taxation and universal (not government controlled) case use. A new financial system/option for all.\n\nThe adoption of such as a currency is still developing and way early in its years. \n\nTherefore, if continued growth and use in this new form of currency is successful, than yes early investors will get more value as more people want it\u2019s use. Raising the value of the still limited (but not rare like BTC as example) 135-140B supply.\n\nAnd there is so much more to it. \n\nMonetary systems are fake. They are what people themselves value. The dollar bill value can go up and down. It\u2019s paper you value\u2026but not even any more. It\u2019s all digital in your bank systems now. Just numbers on a screen.\n\nThis is not anti-government rhetoric or attitude I share. Just simple truth, briefly described in response to your post.",
