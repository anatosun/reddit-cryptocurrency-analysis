I guarantee you've never heard of Gary Kildall and Digital Research and CP/M.\n\n\n\nDOS history:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS\n\n\"IBM PC DOS (and the separately sold MS-DOS) and its predecessor, 86-DOS, was based on Digital Research's CP/M\u2014the dominant disk operating system for 8-bit Intel 8080 and Zilog Z80 microcomputers\u2014but instead ran on Intel 8086 16-bit processors.\n\n\nThe IBM Personal Computer (IBM 5150 PC)\nWhen IBM introduced the IBM PC, built with the Intel 8088 microprocessor, they needed an operating system. Seeking an 8088-compatible build of CP/M, IBM initially approached Microsoft CEO Bill Gates (possibly believing that Microsoft owned CP/M due to the Microsoft Z-80 SoftCard, which allowed CP/M to run on an Apple II).[3] IBM was sent to Digital Research, and a meeting was set up. However, the initial negotiations for the use of CP/M broke down; Digital Research wished to sell CP/M on a royalty basis, while IBM sought a single license, and to change the name to \"PC DOS\". Digital Research founder Gary Kildall refused, and IBM withdrew.[3][4]\n\n\nA sample SCP 86-DOS session (simulated)\nIBM again approached Bill Gates. Gates in turn approached Seattle Computer Products. There, programmer Tim Paterson had developed a variant of CP/M-80, intended as an internal product for testing SCP's new 16-bit Intel 8086 CPU card for the S-100 bus. The system was initially named QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System), before being made commercially available as 86-DOS. Microsoft purchased 86-DOS, allegedly for US$50,000. This became Microsoft Disk Operating System, MS-DOS, introduced in 1981.\"\n\n\n\n\nWindows history:\n\nI assume you already know the story of Xerox.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways remember that Bitcoin as a whole can't be bought or cloned and controlled by a single person.  If Bill Gates doesn't like Bitcoin, who cares?  What has he created originally ever and it was a success?",
