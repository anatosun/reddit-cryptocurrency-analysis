I guarantee you've never heard of Gary Kildall and Digital Research and CP/M.\n\n\n\nDOS history:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS\n\n\"IBM PC DOS (and the separately sold MS-DOS) and its predecessor, 86-DOS, was based on Digital Research's CP/M\u2014the dominant disk operating system for 8-bit Intel 8080 and Zilog Z80 microcomputers\u2014but instead ran on Intel 8086 16-bit processors.\n\n\nThe IBM Personal Computer (IBM 5150 PC)\nWhen IBM introduced the IBM PC, built with the Intel 8088 microprocessor, they needed an operating system. Seeking an 8088-compatible build of CP/M, IBM initially approached Microsoft CEO Bill Gates (possibly believing that Microsoft owned CP/M due to the Microsoft Z-80 SoftCard, which allowed CP/M to run on an Apple II).[3] IBM was sent to Digital Research, and a meeting was set up. However, the initial negotiations for the use of CP/M broke down; Digital Research wished to sell CP/M on a royalty basis, while IBM sought a single license, and to change the name to \"PC DOS\". Digital Research founder Gary Kildall refused, and IBM withdrew.[3][4]\n\n\nA sample SCP 86-DOS session (simulated)\nIBM again approached Bill Gates. Gates in turn approached Seattle Computer Products. There, programmer Tim Paterson had developed a variant of CP/M-80, intended as an internal product for testing SCP's new 16-bit Intel 8086 CPU card for the S-100 bus. The system was initially named QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System), before being made commercially available as 86-DOS. Microsoft purchased 86-DOS, allegedly for US$50,000. This became Microsoft Disk Operating System, MS-DOS, introduced in 1981.\"\n\n\n\n\nWindows history:\n\nI assume you already know the story of Xerox.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways remember that Bitcoin as a whole can't be bought or cloned and controlled by a single person.  If Bill Gates doesn't like Bitcoin, who cares?  What has he created originally ever and it was a success?",

The service is custodial, which in this case is okay for me.\n\nTo try it out, download muun wallet and fund it with some bits or sats via regular onchain transaction.\n\nThen let the lntip-bot generate a lightning invoice (see 'more info'). In muun choose to **send** some sats and paste the given lightning invoice. Hit send and you lntip-bot account is funded.\n\nTo tip some sats to any redditor (only available in subs where lntipbot is enabled), just drop a line like\n\n!lntip 500\n\nand you're done. Try it out. It's really as simple as that.",
