The order status may have been changed to anything, like from 'NEW' to 'FILLED' or to 'CANCELED'  or something like that\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI say this because I notice when the order is in 'NEW' status, the 'time' and 'updateTime' are the same, but if the status is something else, the two are different and 'updateTime' is higher than 'time'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nlet me know if this fits what you have noticed too",
