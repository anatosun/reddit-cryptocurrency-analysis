Why not a generic connection setting so that anyone with any lightning node can use it? Right now there's documentation only for: Greenlight, Umbrel, RaspiBlitz, MyNode.\n\n- Which brings me to this point. Based on what I've read I think the core functionality of sending messages through lightning is based on the keysend feature, which initially was found only on LND nodes. But [it's been a while since c-lightning offers keysend as well](https://medium.com/blockstream/new-release-c-lightning-0-8-2-1c84fe0c82fe). Are you guys supporting c-lighnting nodes as well?\n\nThanks!, projects looks nice.",
