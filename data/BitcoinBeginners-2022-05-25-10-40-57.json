In 2015 I started spending half my salary every month on buying it and have been doing it with a fixed amount ever since just to piss him off. Fuck you dad.\n\nI've never sold any of it and don't plan on doing so since I don't really need to, I've got a nice job, a small apartment, my computer and my cat Peanut.\n\nFuck you dad, again.",
