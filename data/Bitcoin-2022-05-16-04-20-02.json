The future is bright for BTC, money will start flowing back into it after the next halving, be patient.\n\n3. When I cannot put $100 I put $50, when I cannot put $50, I put $25, when I cannot put $25, I put $10, when I cannot put $10 I put $5.\n\n4. I do not think of my BTC in dollars, I think of it as percentage or Satoshis (very important, has helped me immensely)\n\n5. Whenever I think it will be hard for it to get back to ATH I just remember the rate of adoption and the supply and also remember that with every halving supply gets cut in half.\n\nThis is not financial advise and I only invest what I can afford to lose.",

If you\u2019re here to worry about ATH and the fiat price, which clearly you are or you wouldn\u2019t post about it, then sell next time and take profit. If you\u2019re here to speculate on crypto, then figure out what bitcoin can offer the world and talk about it. And no, that\u2019s not likely hyperbitcoinization of the global financial system in any fast order or digital gold. It needs to be utility based and actually used for something, so what is it?",

May take some time but I think in the long run they will benefit from it. \n\nAs always, its just a patience game, keep on stacking and have a long timeframe like 10 years and more. I don't think that bitcoin will make huge price jumps upwards this year, but if we will stay in the 20k-30k $ Range it would be huge for the upcoming halving and bullrun.\n\nWith rising inflation and rising prices for food, gas and renting I think bitcoin will be one of the few chances to build up wealth over the next years. Hell I'm not even sure if I want to buy property in my country longterm... I fear that there will be a smiliar house pricing bubble like in america.. I really would like to have some nice property outside of a big city but with all the prices rising and interest rates rising I'm not sure if I would like to have a debt of like 400k \u20ac for the next 30 years..",
