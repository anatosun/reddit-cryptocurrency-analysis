I want to accept crypto.  \n\nThe events are $20, so I think fees will be a larger percentage of that if people pay by Bitcoin, unless they also use Coinbase.  \n\nMy plan is to accept Lightning Network, using my Wallet of Satoshi app because Coinbase does not support Lightning Network?\n\nI know there are many coins out there geared for speed and low fees.  But from a practical standpoint, if I\u2019m sitting at the entrance with a cash box for cash and checks, and I want to accept crypto, what's the best way to do it? I think I\u2019m going to use Wallet of Satoshi to accept Lightning Network payments.  I wish there were an easy low-cost option through Coinbase.",
