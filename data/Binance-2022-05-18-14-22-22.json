The 32% APY is equivalent to locking at 12 weeks in Pancakeswap. \n\nIf the market turns bullish again or JPOW suddenly decides to decrease rates, you\u2019d want to use  Pancakeswap locked staking. However, In a market like today, you don\u2019t want to remain locked, just ask the bLUNA holders  who were locked for 21 days the importance of flexibility.  So it\u2019s probably best if you like stacking CAKE to use the flex cake vault above.",

When you do this you allow the farm to spend your cake in order for it to be deposited, meaning the contract creator can spend your cake and effectively rug you.\n\nSure, that might not happen, but idk I haven\u2019t lost any cakes in shady farms, because I don\u2019t fucking put my funds into someone\u2019s smart contract that just copy/pasted their website\u2026 maybe I\u2019m old school\n\nEdit: DYOR but this dude isn\u2019t as shady as I thought \n\n[Link](https://reddit.com/r/pancakeswap/comments/rd9k0a/so_i_coded_my_own_yield_optimizer/)",
