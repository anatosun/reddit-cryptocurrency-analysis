                    "response": "It's a nuanced discussion.\n\nLet's do __Litecoin__ first. It's described by BTC camp as an incentivized testnet for their coin, and in practice follows the same kind of strategy as Bitcoin Core (LN as payment layer, severely restricted L1 capacity). That means despite slightly higher on chain capacity (4x what BTC can do), it essentially won't scale as global p2p cash _on chain_. This is very different from the approach that Bitcoin Cash takes, which is to accommodate as much capacity as technically possible on the blockchain, and to keep block space supply above demand so that it does not enter a cash-destructive fee bidding zone. Roughly, BCH is committed to raising the block size and solving the problems around dealing with that, in order to preserve the basic economic incentives of the p2p cash system, whereas Litecoin, like BTC, has embarked on a course of separating payment layer and settlement layer, ultimately. But ask yourself: If that strategy works on BTC, why would Litecoin be needed at all? Really, only as a testnet.\n\n__Monero__ has stronger privacy (all transaction are cryptographically privacy-protected, no exceptions) whereas BCH has opt-in privacy via CashFusion. This is a tradeoff zone, as the BCH thinking here goes towards at scale, fungibility will arise as long as the mixing is strong enough, and doing that allows BCH to scale slightly better and have some stronger cash-like properties (such as enabling respending of even unconfirmed coins, which provides for basically _instant_ transactions if the parties involved accept the risk for a given transaction. Double Spend Proofs provide additional confidence in the ~3 second timeframe, which is practically good enough for retail).\n\nBitcoin Cash and Litecoin, being descendants of BTC, have advantages over Monero's CryptoNote protocol when it comes to smart contracting. BCH is building out that capability, and even enabling sidechains like SmartBCH which offer full EVM-level scripting capability. That's not accessible on Litecoin or Monero. Also, since it doesn't require scanning all block contents to do Simplified Payment Verification on BCH (and Litecoin), it is easier to construct light wallets for BCH and LTC, and that's why there is a larger choice of e.g. mobile wallets than for Monero.\n\nTL;DR: small, simple transactions will scale better on BCH than on both Litecoin and Monero, but Monero for now has an edge in the privacy domain when it comes to use cases where privacy is more important. \n\n---\n\nDisclaimer: this is a very brief summary of my main feelings about the differences of these coins. There is surely much more to discuss, but I will leave it up to others to delve into that.",

One, all block rewards and transaction fee amounts are publicly viewable. There's no cryptography hiding that.\n\nSecond, after adding up all of the block rewards, you can then run through each transaction and ensure the mathematical proof checks out. This is the same type of cryptography that CashFusion uses when players submit their commitments and components to the CashFusion to ensure no one is lying about their amounts in the Fusion.\n\n> Given that scarcity of supply is a critical component of cryptocurrency's monetary properties\n\nSays who? There are a lot of coins with no supply cap. Monero is still deflationary, actually. As the supply grows from the upcoming tail emission, eventually the amount of new coins coming in and adding to the supply will have less and less of an impact, meaning the inflation rate will go down.\n\n> **Inability to do public accounting**\n\nThis is false. Monero has opt-in transparency. If a charity organization or whoever chooses to, they can share a view key so that everyone can view incoming transactions and see how much XMR the charity has received. However, outgoing transactions cannot be reliably viewed as of 2017. So this statement:\n\n> BCH allows for both transparency or privacy where suited, while XMR gains increased privacy at the cost of the option for transparency.\n\nis completely false.\n\n> **Regulatory pressure**\n\nIf your coin isn't under regulatory heat and pissing off governments, then you're doing something wrong.\n\n> **Global scalability**\n\nWhile true, currently the XMR chain is smaller than the BCH/BTC chains, and with storage prices always on a downtrend and storage capacity always making improvements, this isn't an issue. Funny how it's not an issue for BCH, but it is for XMR? Lol.\n\nXMR already has a dynamic block size limit, a feature that BCH has had \"planned\" for several years.\n\nSad to see the BCH community be so dishonest about other currencies sometimes. Just thought I'd correct a few things here, though.",

Stable coins have core problems:\nhttps://twitter.com/FloweeTheHub/status/1524043918651891715\n\nLast, there isn't really much point in using flexUSD unless you store it on their exchange and get interest rates for it. And that triggers the 'not your keys, not your coin'. You have to trust yet another company not stealing your coin. (not to mention that getting an interest rate means you take a risk that is very poorly advertised on their site).\n\nSo, /u/mtrycz is basically giving his own version of OPs comic.

            "selftext": "Hello to everybody on r/btc\n\nMy name is Jiajun Qian, I'm a developer currently building out an open source self custody mobile wallet for Bitcoin Cash.  The project aims to provide users with a self custody wallet that's accessible to anyone via IOS, and Android. The Hercules wallet features an optional Multisignature setup permitting multiple users, signers to join into the mobile setup configured by the user (2-of-3, 2-of-2, 1-of-4, etc).  Together each of the cosigners sign off on transaction proposals for the funds being held in custody through the mobile client.\n\nI go into a bit more detail demonstrating the various types of different use cases, applications that the mobile wallet can serve in the Flipstarter campaign linked here: [http://flipstarter.bchhub.cash](http://flipstarter.bchhub.cash)\n\nWhile I continue to build out the mobile wallet; I'm also working on making the latest consensus changes scheduled to activate next week on May 15th to the badger-cash node library [https://github.com/bitcoincashhub/bcash](https://github.com/bitcoincashhub/bcash) .  Since the Multisignature library that the mobile wallet utilizes, is built on the badger-cash node library I believe it's good practice to update the library. In the same regard I'd like to be able to provide as much infrastructure tools, and applications to developers as possible during the process of me working on the mobile wallet.  \n\nAll of these projects are and will be hosted here : [https://github.com/bitcoincashhub](https://github.com/bitcoincashhub) .\n\nI'm dedicating as much time as possible into building out the mobile wallet. In search of achieving the milestones I've set for the projects beta release listed in the projects proposal section in the Flipstarter campaign. Please take a look at the campaign and support if the project, and  projects I'm working on seem valuable and worth supporting to you and the community.  My end goal is to improve the current Bitcoin Cash ecosystem and create great projects that can be used for to for everyday use . \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm able to be reached at via email at: [jiajunwuqiong@gmail.com](mailto:jiajunwuqiong@gmail.com) / [jjqian@163.com](mailto:jjqian@163.com)\n\nAnd on telegram, wechat:   jjqian01\n\nI want to thank all of the Bitcoin Cash supporters, and developers who help make Bitcoin Cash the best form of digital currency available in the world. I'm looking to continue building out great projects and advance the current ecosystem this year with new applications, projects under the BitcoinCashHub organization.\n\nI am also actively looking for new opportunities in the Bitcoin Cash development space as well. If there are any projects and teams looking for active contributors please reach out to me and let me know!",

I've tested the client with BCHN and it's working fine. I'd like to get the badger-cash library ready before May 15th so there's more options and I like the library it's simple easy to use. It'll help in the future for more projects too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWow, that's surely an ambitious work for which I wish you all the   \nsuccess!

I am a BCH enthusiast and devs provide the best content to learn about how great BCH can be.\n\nWith recent events (UST depegging) in mind, I remember learning about a future improvement to Anyhedge contracts that could be used to basically replicate a stable coin. I think it had to do with being able to transfer anyhedge contracts before expiry which won't be initially possible. \n\nI think an article on how replicating a stable coin using Anyhedge on layer 1 BCH is fundamentally 'better'? than how stable coins work today would be great. I dont actually know how its better thats why I need General Protocols to teach me (and everyone else). I think it might have to do with how anyhedge contracts are peer to peer rather than everyone using the same contract. and of course because BCH transactions are basically free.\n\nA more in depth article on the Anyhedge 2.0's release. I remember it was pushed back to incorporate the May 15th upgrades but hearing about it's features would be interesting. I remember hearing about a feature where you could follow an address/trader to see their results. I'd love to know if an API will be included on initial release. \n\nI would like to hear about other protocols General Protocols is exploring.

Let me give you just the short answer at least.\n\n> I think it had to do with being able to transfer anyhedge contracts before expiry which won't be initially possible.\n\nYou remembered correctly. It won't be possible until the upgrade because the extra complexity just doesn't fit. We'll get to experimenting with that at some point after the basics are operating smoothly. It won't be a stable-coin, but it will be a stability solution that keeps increasing in utility over time as people use it and we improve it.\n\n> I think an article on how replicating a stable coin using Anyhedge on layer 1 BCH is fundamentally 'better'? than how stable coins work today would be great\n\nYou may have read it, but we did write this related article: [Stability Solutions - An Overview](https://read.cash/@GeneralProtocols/stability-solutions-an-overview-afc269d1).\n\n> it might have to do with how anyhedge contracts are peer to peer rather than everyone using the same contract\n\nYeah that's a big part of it. No giant shared contract that becomes a target for regulators, attacks, and is hard to upgrade. It has drawbacks as well with the need to create markets in other ways.\n\n> A more in depth article on the Anyhedge 2.0's release\n\nWe'll definitely do this when the time is right.\n\n> I would like to hear about other protocols General Protocols is exploring. I only know of Anyhedge but I am pretty sure that is just the first protocol.\n\n[HopCash](https://hop.cash) has been an interesting side adventure that of course we took seriously since we decided to do it. Learned a few things doing that.\n\nWe also have Flipstarter close to our hearts since we worked so hard on it. It obviously needs a platform to make it accessible and no one has done that yet. We would like to if we can get to a position where it makes sense.\n\nBeyond that, we aim to make it possible to run a whole economy on BCH. Starting with some basic banking features. One step at a time.",
