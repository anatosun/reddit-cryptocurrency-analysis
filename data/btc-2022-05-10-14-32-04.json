                    "response": "It's a nuanced discussion.\n\nLet's do __Litecoin__ first. It's described by BTC camp as an incentivized testnet for their coin, and in practice follows the same kind of strategy as Bitcoin Core (LN as payment layer, severely restricted L1 capacity). That means despite slightly higher on chain capacity (4x what BTC can do), it essentially won't scale as global p2p cash _on chain_. This is very different from the approach that Bitcoin Cash takes, which is to accommodate as much capacity as technically possible on the blockchain, and to keep block space supply above demand so that it does not enter a cash-destructive fee bidding zone. Roughly, BCH is committed to raising the block size and solving the problems around dealing with that, in order to preserve the basic economic incentives of the p2p cash system, whereas Litecoin, like BTC, has embarked on a course of separating payment layer and settlement layer, ultimately. But ask yourself: If that strategy works on BTC, why would Litecoin be needed at all? Really, only as a testnet.\n\n__Monero__ has stronger privacy (all transaction are cryptographically privacy-protected, no exceptions) whereas BCH has opt-in privacy via CashFusion. This is a tradeoff zone, as the BCH thinking here goes towards at scale, fungibility will arise as long as the mixing is strong enough, and doing that allows BCH to scale slightly better and have some stronger cash-like properties (such as enabling respending of even unconfirmed coins, which provides for basically _instant_ transactions if the parties involved accept the risk for a given transaction. Double Spend Proofs provide additional confidence in the ~3 second timeframe, which is practically good enough for retail).\n\nBitcoin Cash and Litecoin, being descendants of BTC, have advantages over Monero's CryptoNote protocol when it comes to smart contracting. BCH is building out that capability, and even enabling sidechains like SmartBCH which offer full EVM-level scripting capability. That's not accessible on Litecoin or Monero. Also, since it doesn't require scanning all block contents to do Simplified Payment Verification on BCH (and Litecoin), it is easier to construct light wallets for BCH and LTC, and that's why there is a larger choice of e.g. mobile wallets than for Monero.\n\nTL;DR: small, simple transactions will scale better on BCH than on both Litecoin and Monero, but Monero for now has an edge in the privacy domain when it comes to use cases where privacy is more important. \n\n---\n\nDisclaimer: this is a very brief summary of my main feelings about the differences of these coins. There is surely much more to discuss, but I will leave it up to others to delve into that.",

The project aims to provide users with a self custody wallet that's accessible to anyone via IOS, and Android. The Hercules wallet features an optional Multisignature setup permitting multiple users, signers to join into the mobile setup configured by the user (2-of-3, 2-of-2, 1-of-4, etc).  Together each of the cosigners sign off on transaction proposals for the funds being held in custody through the mobile client.\n\nI go into a bit more detail demonstrating the various types of different use cases, applications that the mobile wallet can serve in the Flipstarter campaign linked here: [http://flipstarter.bchhub.cash](http://flipstarter.bchhub.cash)\n\nWhile I continue to build out the mobile wallet; I'm also working on making the latest consensus changes scheduled to activate next week on May 15th to the badger-cash node library [https://github.com/bitcoincashhub/bcash](https://github.com/bitcoincashhub/bcash) .  Since the Multisignature library that the mobile wallet utilizes, is built on the badger-cash node library I believe it's good practice to update the library. In the same regard I'd like to be able to provide as much infrastructure tools, and applications to developers as possible during the process of me working on the mobile wallet.  \n\nAll of these projects are and will be hosted here : [https://github.com/bitcoincashhub](https://github.com/bitcoincashhub) .\n\nI'm dedicating as much time as possible into building out the mobile wallet. In search of achieving the milestones I've set for the projects beta release listed in the projects proposal section in the Flipstarter campaign. Please take a look at the campaign and support if the project, and  projects I'm working on seem valuable and worth supporting to you and the community.  My end goal is to improve the current Bitcoin Cash ecosystem and create great projects that can be used for to for everyday use . \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm able to be reached at via email at: [jiajunwuqiong@gmail.com](mailto:jiajunwuqiong@gmail.com) / [jjqian@163.com](mailto:jjqian@163.com)\n\nAnd on telegram, wechat:   jjqian01\n\nI want to thank all of the Bitcoin Cash supporters, and developers who help make Bitcoin Cash the best form of digital currency available in the world. I'm looking to continue building out great projects and advance the current ecosystem this year with new applications, projects under the BitcoinCashHub organization.\n\nI am also actively looking for new opportunities in the Bitcoin Cash development space as well. If there are any projects and teams looking for active contributors please reach out to me and let me know!",
