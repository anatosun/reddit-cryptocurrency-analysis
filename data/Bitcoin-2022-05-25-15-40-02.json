While bitcoin is held on the blockchain, bitcoin wallets contain the private keys needed to sign transactions.\u00a0\n\n**Seed words:** a sequence of 12 or 24 randomly generated words. These words are a wallet\u2019s backup.\n\n**Passphrase:** an additional word or phrase that adds an extra layer of security to your backup. Always store this separate from your seed words.\u00a0  \n**Private key:** a secret alphanumeric password/number auto generated when you make a new wallet. A private key proves ownership.  \n**Public key:** used in a transaction to verify that the owner of the corresponding private key has created a valid signature as proof of ownership of funds.  \n**Extended public key (Xpub):** a master view into your bitcoin wallet. Anyone with your Xpub can derive all of your public keys (see every past and future transaction that you make).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest options for self-custody\n\nMobile: Samourai Wallet\n\nDesktop: Sparrow Wallet\n\nHardware: Passport Wallet",
