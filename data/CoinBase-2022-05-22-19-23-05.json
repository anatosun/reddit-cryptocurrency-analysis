It only shows in the wallet cause you can trade now while Coinbase waits for your funds to arrive. Once they arrive, it updates what can be spent on the card. You cannot spend money you don\u2019t have. People need to stop buying with ACH & thinking it is instantly gonna let them spend. I\u2019m sick of saying this same information like 12x a week because dumb people like you do not understand how ACH transfers work.",
