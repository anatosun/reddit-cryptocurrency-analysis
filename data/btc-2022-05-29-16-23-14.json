Printing cash notes with solid gold embedded is probably illegal/**forbidden**, since they're intended as currency. But on a small island it's too much work when you can just use BCH instead. However cash-gold works well as physical **backing** for crypto, + it's a backup in case the internet isn't working. Over 50 yrs even an island could issue some notes to see if they become popular world-wide!\n\nWhy would anyone issue cash-gold? I believe it has huge **advertising** value. You can basically sell off all the ad space on 1mg, 10mg, 100mg & 1g notes. Imagine everyone in India holding a 1mg note! (Not currently legal, of course.)\n\nOver 50 yrs the price of small XRF machines should come way down, allowing **decentralized verification** of all notes (+ some cheap trick to get the **weight** of metal in the note).",
