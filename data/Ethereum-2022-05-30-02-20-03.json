But by itself, it doesn't really enforce an end goal or specific use-cases. That's up to people/communities/companies/countries to decide what they want to do with it.\n\n>To be a currency used in everyday transactions across the globe? \n\nNot really. Ether-the-currency's \"true\" use-cases are to secure Ethereum-the-network, and to be the currency you use to pay for gas fees when you use the network. Of course it's still a scarce asset, if you want to use it as money or collateral or whatever if you want but that's entirely up to you.\n\n>more niche stuff like smart contracts (defi,nfts, stablecoins) \n\nThese things are niche today, but they're just a subset of what's possible with turing complete smart contracts (which is pretty much infinitely many things). If you can imagine it, you can code it. Including non-financial use-cases which will continue emerging as computation capacity scales.\n\nTo me it's pretty cool that you can have truly open-sources apps where the back-end always runs the same code as-is that you can audit yourself. Sure, the average joe doesn't give a shit about that, but it's not much different from how I can install Linux and reap the benefits of an open source OS without necessarily having to audit every line myself, because if something funky's going on then it's likely someone somewhere will have caught it. Compared to proprietary black box stuff where you're at the mercy of whatever central authority running code they claim to be running, collecting all the data they can on you, etc. But overall the fact that you *can* audit everything yourself is a good reason to trust it (that's pretty much what *weak subjectivity* is all about)\n\n>USD/gold has no analogy of smart contracts or anything.\n\nThe whole financial system is the analogy. You can have whole companies or nations using smart contract to trustlessly settle stuff with each other, being sure everything will always runs the same way and cutting a lot of inefficiencies from human error, having to verify everything, suing each other when someone doesn't hold up their contractual obligations, etc.",

A voice of reason in the darkness. \nSo many people have forgotten the original ethereum faq where they themselves stated in no uncertain terms that eth was not a currency but a token to pay for compute. \n\nI have been saying for years that the crypto economy will be a complex weaving of chains together to bring new capabilities into existence with a smart contracts/computing platform like Ethereum as the engine powering it. \n\nImagine an autonomous data center, fueled by crypto, managed by AI/ML, driven by smart contracts.  Market analysis set prices, internal algorithms define and manage networks and hardware maintenance activities and digital assistants managing service calls and interacting with vendors.  I will admit, not a wholly original idea on my part.  Inspired by things like RPO and Demon by Daniel Suarez.",

I haven\u2019t checked in the last 6 months or so, but IIRC sharding is the key phase that would lower gas while massively increasing eth\u2019s processing power. I also believe that Vitalik sees L2/rollups as essential short term, but less required as the eth network continues to improve. \n\nSo much time and energy is going into the switch to POS, when that phase is completed I think we\u2019ll see more innovation, and faster",

They don't actually send or receive the money every time we make a transaction - this would be too cumbersome. They make notes of credits and debits and change the numbers in their bank accounts. They send these lists of credits and debits through the automated clearing houses. This is like an L2 rollup. \n\nThe federal reserve then takes the batches of credits and debits three times a day, and settles them by debiting and crediting actual money to different banks. \n\nI think Ethereum will eventually be a decentralized final settlement layer, where different protocols and chains meet to settle their debts. Other chains and protocols will probably interface with each other directly and create ledgers and records of credits and debits each is owed - but when they both tally everything up and it comes time to actually transfer the money, I think it will go through Ethereum.",

But maybe - and that is a political thing - countries could choose Ethereum as the platform for their CBDCs. CDBCs could solve many issues we have today IF done properly. Basically, what if a country just releases a stablecoin on Ethereum? They can program whatever regulations/privacy/administrative features they want and perfectly guarantee stability.\n\nSo, the endgame for ETH is being fuel for all these applications. More sort of a commodity than a currency, or at least a hybrid.\n\nRegarding the endgame of Bitcoin I see an angry mob of environmentalists smashing lambo windows and sinking yachts which will ultimatively hurt the BTC price.",

You can spin up an ERC-20 token with whatever issuance pattern you like. You can even have it issued via the same PoW-driven algorithm as BTC, [here's a quick tutorial](https://lightrains.com/blogs/how-to-create-mineable-erc20-tokens/).\n\nIf \"digital gold\" is what you're after, there's an easy way to accomplish that too. You can spin up a new instance of MakerDAO and peg it to the value of an ounce of gold instead of to the US dollar.\n\nI'm not aware of any major tokens that have done this. Since the capability is there I assume it's likely due to a lack of demand for these features.",

It's very, very far from \"vitalik can give himself a million eth in secret\". The Ethereum Foundation doesn't rule with an open fist, read up on [its philosophy of subtraction](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy/)\n\nThe protocol will also eventually ossify into something sustainable that no one controls or can take down or change on a whim. It just takes longer than Bitcoin to get there because there's way more problems to solve.

A good example being Oil. Oil is used in multiple processes to deliver other products and is traded as an asset. ETH is used in the process of computing within a blockchain to do something. From defi, to tokens, to gaming. Its primary function is to not simply be a currency, but to be the fuel to drive many other things. That could also be in the use of sending a basic currency transaction in the case of USDC or USDT... so yea... I would argue that ETH is a CryptoCommodity, not a CryptoCurrency.",

Once we have data sharding, Ethereum will be able to run a substantial portion of the global economy.\n\nAnd of course, because of 1559, in that world every ETH holder would be effectively collecting fees on all those transactions.",

I have been researching the area for my company who are interested in publishing documents to a blockchain so they can be verified and certain nothing about the file has been changed. My only issue with my research currently is that IPFS is still new so its to stand the test of time and some innovation is needed to be certain the documents are stored forever.

You can comfortably stake and HODL your ETH while using stablecoins as currency.  \n\nETH's value is/will be derived from the chain being a shared global computer.  Applications built upon Ethereum have their own value, but because block space is scarce and users have to use Ether for gas, they also build demand and value for Ether.",
