Currently, the shortest random hash seed is 14 letters (without the number and underline at the beginning). Does anyone know a trusted site with a shorter one?\n\nIf there is a site with my requirements I would be able to take advantage of it and predict the next result.\n\nIf anyone could find one, you would get a hefty amount of money from me.\n\nThanks and have a great day",
