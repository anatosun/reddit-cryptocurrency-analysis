That is, you buy Bitcoin, then you send it from the exchange to your own hardware wallet, where you let it sit, and sit for 15, 20, maybe 25 years.  \n\nMany people use DCA (dollar cost averaging); they buy a fixed amount (say, $200) of Bitcoin at regular intervals (every week, every month, every day...), no matter what the price of Bitcoin has been doing short term.  \n\nMany people \"buy the dips\" along the way.  \n\nSelling Bitcoin for US Dollars (or anything else, including real estate) is NOT how to become wealthy.  \n\nYou never want to sell Bitcoin, until you're older, extremely wealthy, and you can buy nice things with a small fraction of your Bitcoin.  \n\nTrying to time the market is futile and will cause you to lose money over the long term.  \n\nTrying to earn interest puts your Bitcoin at risk and is likely to leave you with no Bitcoin at some point.  It's not worth the risk.  You can't earn interest without taking risk.  \n\nStart thinking long term.  If you play it safe: live frugally and keep buying Bitcoin to hold, you're very likely to have a fantastic retirement in your 30's.",

You can also lend liquidity by opening channels and charging a fee in a marketplace. \n\nBut you\u2019re very unlikely to earn more than 1% a year doing so. Combined with effort require for good channel management, and the risk of using a hot wallet and beta software (can\u2019t have bitcoin in cold storage for this) it may not be worth the risk. \n\nNow, if you want to run a Lightning Node to stay self-custodial for your own Lightning payments\u2026or just as a hobby or to help the network grow. Go for it! Check out solutions such as Umbrel or RaspiBlitz.",

Not for everyone, and not at all.  \n-If you cant afford 20% down, you cant afford the house? Yea see how that worked out for people who didnt buy a house with 3% down 5+ years ago because it \u201cwasnt responsible\u201d. Hardly anybodys earnings have kept up with housing market, if you couldnt afford 20% back then youre waaaay deeper in the hole now.  \n-Put 8 months of savings/bills in a bank savings account before investing? Nice try Mr. WorldBankMan.  \n-Bitcoin is fake money? As fake as my house and my BMWs\u2026",

Never did I once hear/stumble across bitcoin.\n\nThese are all instances in my life had I learned about bitcoin then, I could have been mining with my quad GPU gaming rig. Although my political and social views at those times likely wouldn't be what they are today. My morals are what gives me conviction in my BTC investment, and I likely wouldn't have held this long had I got in at any of those past chances.
