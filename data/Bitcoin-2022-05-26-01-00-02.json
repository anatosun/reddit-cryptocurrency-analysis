All the conventional wisdom, while it may appear \u201cresponsible\u201d is not.  \n-Go to college, get paid? Not for everyone, and not at all.  \n-If you cant afford 20% down, you cant afford the house? Yea see how that worked out for people who didnt buy a house with 3% down 5+ years ago because it \u201cwasnt responsible\u201d. Hardly anybodys earnings have kept up with housing market, if you couldnt afford 20% back then youre waaaay deeper in the hole now.  \n-Put 8 months of savings/bills in a bank savings account before investing? Nice try Mr. WorldBankMan.  \n-Bitcoin is fake money? As fake as my house and my BMWs\u2026",

I've always been a pc gamer and liked to torrent movies, I've heard of Bitcoin a few times over the years and even tried to buy one when it was at 50$ and gave up after that. It wasnt untill the greed of 2017 I got into it, for the same reasons, greed and to get rich quick. Ofcourse shortly after I was put down on my feet and the bearmarket of 2018 hit, left with 2 choices. Either I'd stop and take the loss, or look deeper and double down. I went for the latter and fell down the rabbit hole, absorbing as much information as I could growing to love the fundamental and potential of Bitcoin/crypto\n\nI came for the money and stayed for the technology, its truly a remarkable invention",
