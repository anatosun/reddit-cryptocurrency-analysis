I don't have a bank account with money that I could spend on  bitcoin, but I remembered that I have some change from grandma in an old piggy bank of mine, which is now broken because there was no plug for me to empty it out without breaking it.. I have seen Bitcoin at a stable level after its massive drop  so I though now would be the time to buy with knowledge from trading  virtual money on the stock exchange. Was it a good idea in thought it is  my first ever Bitcoin purchase or should I have waited?",

I\u2019m sure crypto stuffs is very complicated and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not that easy so I am contemplating if I should do it or not. BTW, I fontina really planning on anything about my $50, I just want it to sit there and maybe grow if it can? Will it? Please enlighten me. Thank You",

Coinbase Pro chooses to charge their customers a very small bitcoin withdrawal fee. Gemini chooses to give every customer 10 free bitcoin withdrawals per month and then charges them 0.001 BTC per bitcoin withdrawal for any more. Strike, Swan Bitcoin, and FTX don't charge their customers anything for bitcoin withdrawals.",

Everyone else is an opportunist. If you can't store your BTC yourself, you must trust a middleman to hold it for you. Not only does Binance charge extortionate fees for transferring out, they have multiple security holes that can leave your vulnerable to hackers. There is no customer service at Binance and no recourse for you as a customer if Binance algorithms detect any unusual activity. When anything \"unusual\" is detected on the account, it is immediately locked. It will be up to you to prove to the Binance AI that you are who you say you are and also to provide proof of income, citizenship etc before regaining access to the funds in your account. As bad as this sounds, it still ignores the reality that if Binance were to go under they would almost certainly take the assets of their customers with them into financial oblivion. Tread at your own risk on Binance (or any CEX). With the high exit fees and low security and non existent customer service there really is no logical reason to use the service at all.",
