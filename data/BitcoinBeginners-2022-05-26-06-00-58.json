I'm wondering about the software support side of things.\n\nI understand it's advised to run bitcoin core as my own node for the highest privacy?\n\nI have only a Windows 10 desktop that I use everyday as my everything computer.  Is it OK to put bitcoin core on this computer?  I understand Tor comes with or is built in to bitcoin core?\n\nAlso, I'm reading that setting up an Electrum server paired with bitcoin core is the way to go.  Only Electrum servers can't run on Windows?  Only Electrum PERSONAL servers?  Is this OK?  \n\n\nAre these three things all I need to interact with my HW wallet?  \n\\-Bitcoin Core  \n\\-Tor  \n\\-Electrum Personal server?",

It's important you set it up properly before wallet creation so it never uses your pubkey to query a public node.\n\nBitcoin core is a technical way to go around it. You then also need to set up electrum personal server, yes (Electrum Server is public; it serves *all* electrum users). Then point Electrum to that. Tor is optional but recommended. That is a good setup and I did use it for years. But then I switched to Umbrel.\n\nEverything node is far easier with the Umbrel package. A full bitcoin node with lightning and apps, its meant for a raspberry pi 4 or similarly powered pc. It has a slick interface that you access from any web browser on your local network, lots of add-on apps for management and functionality. I strongly recommend setting that up instead of bitcoin core.\n\nIt's super easy to point electrum, or many various wallet interfaces, to Umbrel. They have a walk-through menu for all kinds of wallets. And the best part, Umbrel is free. [https://getumbrel.com/](https://getumbrel.com/)",
