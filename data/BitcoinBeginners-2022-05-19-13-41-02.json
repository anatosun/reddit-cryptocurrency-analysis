As decentralized and regulated insurance options start popping up for crypto(i.e. against hacks and scams) both in the US and worldwide, I am curious what your opinion is on the matter. Is it needed? Is it unnecessary? I've seen arguments for both sides but would love to compare a general opinion.\n\nAre there factors when thinking about insuring your crypto? Does the amount you own factor into looking for insurance? For example, the more you own, the more you have to lose. Or for those who see their crypto as a long-term investment, is insurance even a thought for you?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",
