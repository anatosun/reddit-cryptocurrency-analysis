Looking forward to your comments.",

Then and only then when you get more money put it into Eth lol. dude I\u2019ve been look for this answer for a long time. My end conclusion always come back to btc and Eth. that\u2019s just my opinion. Iv drop the idea of stocks, gold, silver, real estate etc. because out of those it\u2019s still tied to one system. I\u2019m gonna do the opposite of what the government is telling me is safe and a good investment and I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to explain myself. Tried \u201cshitcoins\u201d as well. But 98 percent of coins that we see now will be no longer in 10+ years in my opinion. Don\u2019t chase hype and greed that all these other coins are unfolding, because in the end everyone wants to be like btc and Eth.",
