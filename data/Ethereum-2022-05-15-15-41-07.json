Invested some small amounts in bitcoin and Ethereum but completely unaware about the underlying technology (tried to learn some basics of bitcoin like POW and hash etc, but thats it).\n\nI would like to learn more about Ethereum and how it works but not sure where to start. I come from a non-CS background and completely lost in the terminology. The term \"layer\" keeps coming up and I have no idea what it means.\n\nMy main objective is to eventually learn solidity and smart contracts. Where should I start? Any good YouTube videos or courses you can suggest?\n\nThanks in advance!!",
