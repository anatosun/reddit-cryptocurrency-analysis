Yet the orders history shows they are filled with transaction ids and everything.\n\nSo what happened? Did the money get spent or not? Did I get the coins or not?\n\nI am an experienced user and I am very confused about the state of my account. I don't want to risk double spending, but I think I'm missing out on the lower prices.\n\nI have used coinbase since 2017 and honestly this makes me want to move elsewhere. I have lost confidence in the platform.\n\nCrypto can never be mainstream with events like this. Who in their right mind would use a bank or stock exchange where a transaction *might* work?
