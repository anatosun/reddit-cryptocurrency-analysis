They all show up as filled in my orders history, yet I received no coins.\n\nAfter waiting nearly an hour, I now see the deposited usd on my account, still unspent. Yet the orders history shows they are filled with transaction ids and everything.\n\nSo what happened? Did the money get spent or not? Did I get the coins or not?\n\nI am an experienced user and I am very confused about the state of my account. I don't want to risk double spending, but I think I'm missing out on the lower prices.\n\nI have used coinbase since 2017 and honestly this makes me want to move elsewhere. I have lost confidence in the platform.\n\nCrypto can never be mainstream with events like this. Who in their right mind would use a bank or stock exchange where a transaction *might* work? Come on coinbase. This is embarassing.",
