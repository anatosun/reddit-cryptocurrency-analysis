Bitcoin's implementation of proof of work is the true innovation, and nobody can copy it because to do so would require billions of dollars of ASICs and billions of dollars of electricity, with miners spread out all over the world, held to account by a global network of thousands of nodes run by enthusiastic individuals.\n\nShitcoins cannot do this.

People can afford to be ignorant of government monetary policy when inflation of consumer prices is 2%.  When it\u2019s trending towards 10% they can\u2019t. \n\nThere are many people in UK and in the western world generally that have never experienced high inflation in their adult life including myself. They trust in the government\u2019s ability to solve it.  For now\u2026\n\nPeople in the rest of the world are far more aware of government monetary mismanagement, they have been living through it for their entire lives.  They see the uses of bitcoin and other hard assets because their local currencies cannot retain value in the short term never mind the medium or long term. \n\nThe erosion of trust in government economic policy is a one way street in a highly inflationary environment.  People will inevitably be forced to educate themselves on hard assets.  Those who do some basic research will settle on traditional hard assets like gold. Those who choose to venture down the bitcoin rabbit hole will store at least some of their wealth in bitcoin.  Ultimately my speculation is that Bitcoin maximalism is the end result.  The only question is how long it takes.",
