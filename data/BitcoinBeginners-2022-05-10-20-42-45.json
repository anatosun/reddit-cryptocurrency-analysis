Easier with a smaller altcoin project for these attacks that lack the diversity bitcoin has \n\n>Changing the code to PoS?\n\nThat will never happen because full nodes don't self update by themselves and users and miners never would go for it . \n\nProof of stake as a whole is pointless, insecure, and will always trend to centralization\n\nProof of stake game theory insures that those with the most coins will continue to collect the most fees , thus creating a vicious cycle of centralization where they continue to accrue more coins with 0 effort unlike with Proof of work where a meritocracy exists of those trying to be more efficient and miners are forced to sell most of their coins\n\n>Fractional reserves? \n\nthis already occurs when people keep bitcoin on exchanges or lend out their btc for interest. Some of these exchanges and companies are likely fractional which is why we tell people to withdraw the bitcoin \n\n>Creating mass formation propaganda to influence people to not use bitcoin and think it's bad?\n\nThis has been ongoing by haters, banks, and governments for the last 13 years. Propaganda and disinformation can slow down bitcoins growth but not stop the truth",
