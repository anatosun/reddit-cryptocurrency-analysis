Some of these exchanges and companies are likely fractional which is why we tell people to withdraw the bitcoin \n\n>Creating mass formation propaganda to influence people to not use bitcoin and think it's bad?\n\nThis has been ongoing by haters, banks, and governments for the last 13 years.

There are multiple independent implementations and many nodes don't upgrade either. People like myself review the source code and build the binaries from scratch before updating our nodes as well so this also would prevent any malicious code from being added \n\n>If someone had unlimited resources would it be so difficult for them? \n\nMoney can only do so much. Once you have sufficient amount of eyes on the code it becomes almost impossible to compromise it. The game theory is that we are incentivized by many billions of dollars in value to protect our money and since some of the best developers are working on bitcoin (many of them are independently wealthy from being early adopters ) they cannot be easily bribed",

The money creeps only had enough power to develop a failed software fork (SegWit2X) and then their failure fallback was the worthless BCash fork. After wasting their hundreds of millions, their boardrooms echoed with the exclamation, \"If only I understood open source software development before wasting all that money\"\n\n> propaganda to influence people to not use bitcoin\n\nThis has been a constant feature of the public discussion of Bitcoin for several years. It's effective. People who are too lazy of stupid to learn about Bitcoin have a convenient list of propaganda excuses for remaining ignorant. Bitcoin is not affected\n\n> locking down the whole world for the flu levels of influence\n\nThis is a stupid analogy",
