Rather than build a new coin and rip people off again.\nPlus binance and KuCoin hopefully would not allow for Do Kwon to go to a v2 coin.\n\nPlus I'm certain a lot of pre-de-pegged investors also bought at the bottom collapse and recouped some losses.  Those individuals would be rewarded 2x and that also isn't fair.",
