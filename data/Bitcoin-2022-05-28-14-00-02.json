People buy it to hold it so it\u2019s value increases. This means people treat it as a speculative asset, not as a currency, which is clearly true. It\u2019s also true that commodities aren\u2019t valued in bitcoin/satoshi. As in El Salvador, you don\u2019t pay for things in bitcoin, you pay for them in USD and use bitcoin to do that. \n\nYou need to expand and contract the money supply order to meet the demand of the economy. If you can\u2019t do this (bitcoin being finite) then it leads to depressions such as in 1930s USA.\n\nBlockchain is good for democratising government, bitcoin isn\u2019t good as a currency nor is it been used as such.",

There was also less money to lend, partly because people were hoarding it in the form of cash. According to some scholars, that problem was exacerbated by the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates (further depressing lending) and deliberately reduced the money supply in the belief that doing so was necessary to maintain the gold standard (see below), by which the U.S. and many other countries had tied the value of their currencies to a fixed amount of gold. The reduced money supply in turn reduced prices, which further discouraged lending and investment (because people feared that future wages and profits would not be sufficient to cover loan payments)[source](https://www.britannica.com/story/causes-of-the-great-depression)\n\n[chart of money supply dipping during depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_Great_Depression#/media/File:Money_supply_during_the_great_depression_era.png)\n\nI'd also advise you to look at Japan's economy, since they've printed a fuckton of Yen yet haven't experienced any crazy inflation, and look at Afganistan's economy, which can't print money yet has plummeted in value. \n\nHighly likely I won't respond to any replies, I absolutely regret trying to talk economics in a bitcoin sub, it's entirely my own fault.",

Not just Greek, but all Eurozone politicians--and especially Dutch and German.\n\nFirst, Greek politicans were magnificently fiscally irresponsible and were guaranteed that the music would stop at some point. Normally they would have seen warning signs in the market (investors demanding higher yields on their debt) and been prevented from getting in so far over their heads but European banks assumed that if necessary other Eurozone members would bail them out, so they treated Greek sovereign debt as equally risky as German sovereign debt. This was a mistake and is the bankers' sole responsibility for the sovereign debt crisis.\n\nWhen the crisis came to a head other Eurozone members insisted on forcing upon Greece an unsustainable (and indeed ultimately failed) policy of fiscal austerity in order to save *their own* banks which had made these bad loans without having to bail them out *too much* with German/Dutch taxpayer money. Of course, in the end the bridge loans (read: bailouts) they did offer Greece went almost entirely to repaying their own banks (read: bailouts) after a very short stop in Greece. And the austerity measures totally fucked the Greek economy and left them with a higher debt/GDP than at the beginning of the crisis.\n\nThe ultimate root of the problem is that the Eurozone is a monetary union but not a fiscal union. The USD works as the national currency of the entire US from San Francisco to Pittsburgh because we are part of a fiscal union with compensatory fiscal transfers (e.g. social security, military and pork barrel spending, etc.).\n\nWhat Greece *should* have done IMO is told the Germans and Dutch who benefit from their export-boosting artificially-cheap Euro that the time has come to form a more perfect union with a much larger system of fiscal transfers within the Eurozone or else Greece will go back to the Drachma and regain the crucial exchange rate flexibility that ECB's control over monetary policy did not allow them.",

Imagine any loans you have gradually increasing in cost over time instead of losing value. That's what a deflationary system would be. A permanent built in interest rate on any money you borrow because of the gradually increasing scarcity. There are advantages to both inflationary and deflationary currencies. Bitcoin is amazing for storing and increasing the value of your savings in a place not controlled by banks or centralized institutions. But as a means of spending or especially borrowing, it's not ideal. I think the best system is one where we all store our savings in Bitcoin and transfer a small amount into a fiat currency to act as our pool of spendable money at any given time. Also, loans should only be taken out in inflationary currency.",

Because on The Bitcoin Standard the appreciation in value of Bitcoin can only match the growth in total economic production. If the economy is shrinking then Bitcoin value reduces, increasing automatically the incentives to invest (take risk) thus providing an self regulating mechanism of monetary valuation and rate of return.\n\nBitcoin tips the fiat debt slavery model upside down - cry another bucket for the Rothschilds and Goldman Sachs.

The difference is the people would force the gov to print for reasonable investments not to fund pointless wars.\n\nThe problem now is even if you disssgree with the printing, you understand the consequence on your buying power, there is nowhere to hide, everything in the current system is interconnected. Everything goes down when shit hits the fan.\n\nBtc is a way to escape the financial system when it goes out of control. If we all had this option and used it, governments wouldnt be able to print soo much as soon as people would start to abandon the currency.\n\nIn a way you would get a currency democracy.\nRun your fiat, but if the people do not agree with how your spending the tax dollars they can choose to leave.",

Greenspans ceaseless 'puts' began a process that led to QE due to the failure of neoliberal monetarism. The hybridisation of Keynesian easing and Monetarist liberalism is pure hypocrisy and expediency demonstrating the institutional capture of our democracies by the fiat debt slavery banking cartel.\n\nIf this corruption of our economies is not dealt with there is a real and growing risk the CCP autocracy and its politburo composed of over 80% engineers will succeed in reverse engineering the Wests monetary hegemony via Hong Kong and DCEP.",
