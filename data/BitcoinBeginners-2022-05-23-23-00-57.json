The backup is the physical representation. \n\nSure, but you bring up bitrot everytime anything digital gets brought up. Anything can happen. With quantum mechanics a bowling ball has a finite chance of passing through a bank vault if you try enough times. But that doesn't mean it's likely.\n\nAnd yes I agree with 3-2-1.\n\n>dataloss is very common in DVDRWs , usb flash memory , and hard drives \n\nData loss happens with those forms of media but again you haven't talked probability at all. If you're talking about crypto keys, 3-2-1 absolutely should apply. However for people who aren't that well versed in backups, at a minimum I think this is why cloud is actually more valuable. Physical backups require you to be there. If you're traveling, abroad, or your country is on fire (Ukraine), then accessing physical backups may not be feasible. Cloud backups are a real solution people should consider. The risk of a Google Drive file being corrupted is likely orders of magnitude lower than even if you had a personal 3-2-1 strategy. There's no way your personal backup strategy is going to be more resilient than that of a trillion dollar company.\n\nBottom line is risks are everywhere. My point is to evaluate risks holistically. I think too many people often highlight malware but completely ignore and don't accurately weigh the risks of physical backup loss. The vast majority of people aren't using stamped plates with 3 copies. Paper copies are far easier to lose and mess up with than a digital copy.",
