            "selftext": "In 2007 as stocks formed their final peak before crashing during the 2008 global financial crisis everything fell alongside stocks. Even gold tanked and for six long months kept declining alongside stocks.\n\nBut then a decoupling happened, after the inital panic where everything got caught up in a global sell off gold reversed and proceeded to rally very strongly for the next 4 years while stocks kept falling. After the initial 6 months of confused panic people woke up and started searching for a safe haven.\n\nToday we are already in a recession but people just dont realise it yet. Stocks have been falling since November last year, some individual stocks down 60%+, the nasdaq down 30% and the S&P500 just today confirming a bear market by falling more than 20%. And just like 2008 gold has been selling off alongside stocks. This time however so too has bitcoin, which just like stocks has been falling since November last year.\n\nHistory is repeating.\n\nOver the coming months all economic indicators are going to confirm that the world is in a global recession that started in November last year, and everyone will wake up. They will realise whats going on and start looking for a safe haven. Thats when gold and bitcoin will reverse and enter a strong bull market rally over the next few years while stocks keep falling and indexes languish down 70%+ from their November 2021 highs.\n\nGold may double or triple in price seeing its market cap rise from $10T to $20T or even $30T. But bitcoin is starting from a much lower $500B market cap and as banks start failing and inflation runs hotter than expected btc will race to equal golds market cap if not exceed it.\n\nAt a bitcoin market cap of $30T one bitcoin will be worth $1.5 million dollars.\n\nI expect to see gold and bitcoin both decouple from the declining stock market over the next couple of months as a recession is officially confirmed, both beginning a multi-year bull market rally that may last until 2025 taking gold to $5000 per ounce and bitcoin above $1 million.",

We\u2019re recovering from a round of nationalism in some of the major global markets, combined with a global pandemic, which is still raging and causing havoc around the globe.  The biggest threat I see today is the desire of the conservative movement in the US intentionally trying to keep this market depressed to help them win back control.  My prediction is this, if the midterms push control to the GOP, we will have stagflation until the 2024 election.  If the moderates keep control, this recession ends Q1CY2023.

This is everyone\u2019s wet dream in crypto land, but it just ain\u2019t happening, not for a long time. Btc didn\u2019t go to $69k because of retail crypto bros dcaing $50 every paycheck. It went to ath because of institutional investors and whales buying btc because there was no more alpha left in stocks, now they\u2019re both retreating in lock step. Luckily for all crypto investors, we have a crystal ball, it\u2019s called the stock market. Btc mimics the markets, specifically nasdaq 100. The great decoupling will be THE event in crypto when it happens, but not just yet.\n\nEdit: thank you for the award",

For the first 6 months of the 2008 recession the Fed was proclaiming the economy was strong. The same is true today, if a recession started in November last year it wont be confirmed and acknowledged until Q3 2022.\n\nUS GDP was negative in Q1, if it comes in negative again next month for Q2 (which is highly likely) that means the US has been in recession since late last year.\n\nThe severity of a recession is determined by the level of debt burden. Thats why they also go hand in hand with a debt crisis / financial crisis. The household, corporate and sovereign debt levels today are FAR larger and more unsustainable than in 2008 meaning the pain will also be far worse than 2008.",

My best guess is that the fed will stop short of reducing inflation to pre-pandemic levels and it will still be somewhat elevated. Capital gains tax revenue will be very low and that will hurt the fed so they'll want to keep the gravy train going in order to bring in more revenue as well as make their debt easier to pay. \n\n2008 isn't analogous as it was a housing market crash. The fed has control this time. I'm calling a late 2022 early 2023 fed reversal to quantitative easing.",

Yes as enticing as BTC is as an inflation hedge, it is still not there as many have mentioned. It so far acts like the NASDAQ or SP500. A certain subset of investors considers BTC a risk-off asset but it's not there yet.  \nOnce inflation goes down, central banks will turn less hawkish and the market will be able to recover slowly as the fear dissipate. An end to the Ukraine war would also help tremendously but I don't know if NATO really wants peace at that point. So far the war is contributing to the inflation. This is an extremely scary double whammy. Stagflation is not fun.",

If you estimate 30T for gold, you need to deduct a percent of that market cap for bitcoin. So really imagine some portion of 30T being removed from gold and onto bitcoins market share in the future. So if we say that we estimate 5T market cap from Bitcoin, and then it steals a 10T from gold, the it could be 15T realistically. Even this is an over estimate, but a more likely scenario.

I also think bitcoin will flip gold during the coming financial crisis because as banks stumble bitcoin will be the solution not gold.\n\nIf bitcoin didnt exist I could see gold hitting $60T, but because bitcoin does exist I see them sharing those gains equally. Hence why I see them both hitting a $30T market cap. Quant advised hedge funds will likely allocate to both bitcoin and gold in a financial crisis not just gold.\n\nThis would mean a 3x rise for gold, but a 60x rise for bitcoin because bitcoin is 20 times smaller than gold. Bitcoins gains will be far superior. \n\nEven if gold hits $30T and btc hits $3T that means a 3x rise for gold and a 6x rise for btc. The odds are massively on bitcoins side to outperform gold.\n\nIts just math.",

Once unemployment starts increasing the Fed will eventually capitulate and we'll start going sidways/up again.\n\nHowever, eventually in 5-10 years the market will crash with interest rates at zero and the Fed won't be able to pull any more tricks. Once that happens, there will be a second great depression that will take decades to recover from.",
