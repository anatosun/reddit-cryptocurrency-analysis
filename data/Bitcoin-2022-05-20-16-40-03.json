Coins/tokens are basically shares. This kills the blockchains that get designated securities, and if they were decentralized to begin with, and impairment resistant, it wouldn't be a problem. If they don't want to make protocol changes, or don't want to adhere to securities laws, fine. They'll be delisted by every single US exchange within 90 days. Then most international exchanges as well. Their apps/wallets will be removed from the Apple and Google store. Stablecoins like (USDT and USDC) will cease operation within these protocols.
