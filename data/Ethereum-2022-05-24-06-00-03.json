Why can\u2019t a company that wants to use these features just fork ether and do everything in house? \n\nHope this question makes sense\u2026\n\nEdit: My point is what\u2019s stoping a bank from using blockchain tech in-house that lets you make payments faster and more efficient. Would they need to go through ether or another crypto or couldn\u2019t they just develop their own. I know it wouldn\u2019t be decentralized but let\u2019s be honest the average person doesn\u2019t care about decentralization they want to be able to make payments fast and secure and banks want to be able to process them efficiently.",

You want to be in Twitter because other people on Twitter.\n\nNetwork effects are one of the most important concepts in economics. It's very hard to bootstrap network effect but once you achieve it, it becomes self-reinforcing.\n\nNetwork effect is especially important in case of Ethereum because smart contracts has value because they are unstoppable. They are unstoppable because Ethereum network is decentralized (many nodes).\n\nETH is central part in this ecosystem. You need to pay for smart contract execution. So the more dapps are used in Ethereum network, the more valuable ETH. Reverse is also true, because ETH is very liquid, it often used in many dapps (as loan or collateral etc).\n\nThere are potentially more technically advanced networks than Ethereum but they are lacking network effect, and as a result they are lacking decentralisation.\n\nThat's why my portfolio is focused around Ethereum. As one guy on Bankless podcast puts it: Ethereum is like Manhattan, it's crowdy and expensive but everyone wants to be there.",

I need eth to upload the programs I build, and users need eth to run my programs. That\u2019s the fundamental reason why eth has some kind of value. \n\nUsers using my programs need to have their transactions validated. The people who validate these transactions are paid using eth and nothing else. That\u2019s an additional layer of value on top of the fundamental value. \n\nWhy can\u2019t you just fork ethereum and make ether lose all its value? Many reasons. Firstly, all the smart people in blockchain are developing on ethereum and polygon. All of them. Secondly, ethereum is constantly being upgraded, so if you forked it, you\u2019d have the problem of upgrading your fork with equally good upgrades. Thirdly, good engineering involves a lot of innovation, and good engineers hate having their stuff stolen, especially without credit. So if you forked ethereum and copied every upgrade, you\u2019d get a lot of good engineers so pissed at you that your community would disband and your ecosystem would collapse.\n\nHope that helps explain things.",

In simple terms, Ethereum is a combined:\n\n\u27a5Network\n\n\u27a5Platform\n\n\u27a5Marketplace\n\nFor builders & creators. And that's not limited to artists & tech engineers. ENS is developing into a Web 3 portal and will platform small business. \n\nEthereum is user agnostic and maintains a strong focus on utility. Building a widely-used ecosystem of decentalized dapps, & smart contracts, and other digital utilities raises demand for space on the Ethereum blockchain. And no other chain compares in this regard. Ethereum holds an 87% share of all blockchain revenue. \n\nBy necessity, this makes Ether, its native currency, increasingly valuable over time. \n\nEthereum is crypto's most successful project because it focuses on building digital products and service. Over time, users will migrate to chains that do more. Popular adoption can't be sustained without utility. \n\nLong term, projects that don't offer extensive utility & modular design, cannot survive in an environment crowded with projects that do. \n\nThe future belongs to abundance-based currency models. And Ethereum is the standard bearer.",

I know it wouldn\u2019t be decentralized but let\u2019s be honest the average person doesn\u2019t care about decentralization they want to be able to make payments fast and secure and banks want to be able to process them efficiently\n\nyou are misunderstanding something. The features that come with the decentralization such as censorship resistance, trustlessness, and pseudoanonymity are the ONLY benefit of blockchain technology. Blockchain by nature is actually extremely slow, inefficient, and difficult to develop compared to centralized commercial software\n\nmost people do not care at all about decentralization, but many do. And even more care about expensive and outdated service from the financial sector monopolies, and about reckless financial policies and inflation in fiat currency",
