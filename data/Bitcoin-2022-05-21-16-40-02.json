I have to calculate all those capital gains at the end of the year and it gets crazy. I started hiring a CPA 3 years ago because it was just too much for me to go through, but still I'm not trying to make it anymore difficult for her as then she'll probably want to charge me more money. The amount of money I had to start paying for crypto tax programs though with the amount of transactions and taxable events became more than the cost of hiring a CPA so what was the point and even doing it myself at that point you know?",
