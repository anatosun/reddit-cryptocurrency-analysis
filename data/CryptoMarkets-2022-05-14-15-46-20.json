As if we look at the past 5 years Bitcoin price chart -[https://everycoinprice.com/?symbol=BTC&interval=5years](https://everycoinprice.com/?symbol=BTC&interval=5years&exchange=0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBitcoin always rises in the long run. As we all know, there is no other time-tested decentralized digital payment solution out there that could replace crypto yet and everyone will buy more and raise the price as awareness and its usage grows, in the long run. The price will shoot in the coming months, no matter what anyone else told you\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo it's time to stop panicking and fill your bags and most importantly. HODL!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit- Most importantly, What i don't get is people start selling when the price dips and buy when the price rises. That makes most crypto investors lose money and tinting crypto's reputation just because they panic-sold. Don't be these guys, make money where you can and believe in crypto. We are the future",

Atm tho, my main goal remains to manage to mint a genesis Honeyland bee. If that was to take place, I'd say summer ought to be way more interesting for me",
