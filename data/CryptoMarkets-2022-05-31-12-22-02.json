I became interested in trying Gemini because they offer crypto learning tools and a wide variety of supported cryptocurrencies. I also came across AAX and became intrigued when I read their [blog](https://blog.aax.com/en/2022/05/31/aax-unveils-aaxcel-to-enable-crypto-community-to-vote-for-its-preferred-projects/), hoping to contribute and join their community to vote for my favorite crypto projects.\n\nIs it a good idea to try a different exchange this time?   \nWhile we have considered only a few platforms that exist on the market, what platforms do you already use among mentioned or just planning to try?",
