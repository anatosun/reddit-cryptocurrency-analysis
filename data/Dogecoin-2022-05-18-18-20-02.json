Now there\u2019s a whole team I\u2019ve never met, and every communication with them turns into a quagmire whereas we used to just nut it out over dinner. But then that\u2019s what happens when you have two million customers I guess.\n\nLook, these companies are businesses. Even though they\u2019re into crypto, they still have to operate in the real world. Which means regulations at many different levels. And if they\u2019re publicly listed, that adds a whole new layer of oversight, from stock exchanges and shareholders.\n\nAny board which does shonky things is going to find itself with microscopes jammed where the sun don\u2019t shine, and they will end up out of a job. And maybe having a holiday \u2018at her Majesty\u2019s pleasure\u2019, as they say.\n\nAnd for what? They get paid no matter what, so why would they risk their careers, reputations and personal liberties to make dirty money for someone else?\n\nThere are many perfectly legitimate ways for exchanges to make money. And they use them all. Right now, everybody and his dog is jumping into lending, and they\u2019re all offering new features that pay you part of the income, and which leave you holding all the risk. And that\u2019s fine, because it\u2019s your responsibility to know what you\u2019re signing up for.\n\nThere is absolutely zero need for anyone to steal coins to lend out. And believing that they do this is like believing any of the BS floating around in conspiracy theory circles. It just isn\u2019t real.",

Your private keys only live on the hardware device, and in the case of Ledger, it uses BIP 39 (others might too, but I don't own them, so I'll speak for sure on Ledger). So long as you keep your passphrase (24 words)  secure, it's a very safe way to store your crypto (you'll want some sort of offline backup in case the device is ever lost, breaks). \n\nThe device requires a pin to open, then you go to the app, then the app will ask you to verify the wallet address before signing with your private key. Some ledger models can connect to the app with bluetooth and/or usb-c.\n\nOther than needing to connect the hardware wallet to the app, sending and receiving Doge works like most other wallets.",

There have been many exchanges which have imploded, through theft, scams, poor management or technical failures. And people have lost fortunes. Mt Gox lost 90% of all Bitcoins when they went under. So don\u2019t treat any third party like a bank. They\u2019re not.\n\nThe other reason is mostly bullsh!t. People have the erroneous belief that exchanges lend your coins out without your permission. This is totally wrong, and would likely be illegal. What they do do is they offer you interest, and in the fine print it says that you carry all the risk if the people they lend your coins to fail to repay. But you have to willingly agree to this, so always read the fine print with any agreement.\n\nAs for where to store your coins, just use a text file. It\u2019s fast, free, and totally secure as long as you store it offline with multiple copies in case of disaster.",

If you really want to carry coins around, put a copy of one of your wallets with a small amount of coins in a text file on your device, and you\u2019re good to go. Then you can use coinb.in live to spend coins. But only for wallets with low balances. For more valuable wallets, only ever use a local copy of the site offline.",
