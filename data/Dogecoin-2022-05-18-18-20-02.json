There is a crazy bs game going on behind the scenes against dogecoin.\n\nThe exchanges are lending out \u201cour\u201d coins, they are in possession of, for short interest to gain profits from us (the front end users) and the shorts (back end borrowers) using the coins \u201cwe own\u201d on the exchange.\n\nAlso hurting the value potential of doge.

So long as you keep your passphrase (24 words)  secure, it's a very safe way to store your crypto (you'll want some sort of offline backup in case the device is ever lost, breaks). \n\nThe device requires a pin to open, then you go to the app, then the app will ask you to verify the wallet address before signing with your private key. Some ledger models can connect to the app with bluetooth and/or usb-c.\n\nOther than needing to connect the hardware wallet to the app, sending and receiving Doge works like most other wallets.",

There have been many exchanges which have imploded, through theft, scams, poor management or technical failures. And people have lost fortunes. Mt Gox lost 90% of all Bitcoins when they went under. So don\u2019t treat any third party like a bank. They\u2019re not.\n\nThe other reason is mostly bullsh!t. People have the erroneous belief that exchanges lend your coins out without your permission. This is totally wrong, and would likely be illegal. What they do do is they offer you interest, and in the fine print it says that you carry all the risk if the people they lend your coins to fail to repay. But you have to willingly agree to this, so always read the fine print with any agreement.\n\nAs for where to store your coins, just use a text file.
