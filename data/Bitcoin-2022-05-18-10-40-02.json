I think the point is that no one can use money to destroy someone else now, you have to actually use diplomacy and get along or find some other way to threaten people into subversion. Money systems have allowed people to destroy in a more \"socially acceptable\" manner, probably not a good scalable thing to normalize that overtime?",

I went to school for it. the navy taught me some and i can assure you its not fucking 30 minutes of learn time. Maybe a week or two of 8 hour school time before you're okay enough to not completely fuck up the transmission. theres pause breaks and shit that you need to know otherwise you'll be sending garbage. It takes about two weeks just to learn it and then about a month of learning to transcribe it. Sending it is way easier than transcribing it. It's also super easy to fuck up a number or letter and takes critical thinking to adjust to the fuckups. Not really conducive to sending BTC wallet IDs.",

As citizen of Finland I could very much consider donating some BTC to Ukrainians, as from here, as a private citizen, it is one of possible actions available for me. I regularly donate blood to local red cross, I so so much hope my blood is not going to be needed there but obviously I'm continuying in that activity too. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks so deeply. \n\nHere, it might be difficult to know which BTC wallet address belongs to Putins war chest and which to legitimate Ukrainian government. \n\nBut for the anon-part: if you think you could spare a dime, it might be easiest to contact Ukrainian embassy in your country and ask for BTC wallet address. Or IBAN, if you can spare fiat. And it might be good idea to verify the communication using both e-mail and a voice call because I'm quite certain russians are trying to intercept communictions of Ukrainian embassies. And for natural reasons they will be currently very very busy doing things like not answering to questions \"how to donate \u20ac20\". \n\nMaking an offer is still better than no action at all.",
