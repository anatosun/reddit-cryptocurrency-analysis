Do your findings well buddy.\n\nRailgun code has been audited by prominent audit companies with expertise in zk-SNARKs techs like ABDK and Zokyo. ABDK are domain experts in cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs. Feel free to read about them because they develop an essential part of the RAILGUN system, and are certainly amongst the most qualified companies to audit a privacy system.\n\nRead about ABDK\u2019s audit [here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmaV1AAquDzwQmhF2YffKE2vxfehXNBrmpYesKtFf8do2h?filename=Railgun%20ABDK%20Audit%20-%20July%202021.pdf) and also feel free to read about Zokyo\u2019s audit [here](https://assets.website-files.com/5f99eb79d508ca853be5f2e8/61cadd8ad29fb3d0bd157d41_RAILGUN%20SC%20Audit.pdf).",
