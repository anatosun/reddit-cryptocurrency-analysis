            "selftext": "Bitcoin is the world\u2019s best-known cryptocurrency, but there are still some unique facts about it that you probably did not know!\n\n**Fact #1: Nearly One in Five Bitcoin has been Lost Forever**\n\nAccording to Chainanalysis, a leading cryptocurrency data analytics company, almost 20% of Bitcoin has been permanently lost or remains stuck in crypto wallets that are inaccessible because of no password. This is equivalent to about 3.75 million BTC of unusable wealth.\n\n**Fact #2: The Maximum Number of Bitcoins that can be Created is not 21 Million** \n\nAlmost everyone knows that Bitcoin is a finite asset, and a maximum of 21 million BTC can ever come into circulation. Right? Wrong! The exact number is slightly less than 21 million. It is 20,999,987.4769 BTC, to be precise.\n\n**Fact # 3: The Smallest Unit in the Bitcoin System is not Satoshi**\n\nOne Satoshi is one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC). It is a common belief that in the Bitcoin system, Satoshi is the smallest unit of measurement. Right? Wrong, again! The smallest unit that is already in use is Millisatoshi, which is equal to one-thousandth of a Satoshi, or 0.00000000001 BTC.\n\n**Fact # 4: Bitcoin\u2019s Creator has a Statue Built in his Honor**\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts revere the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin whose real identity remains unknown to the world. But did you know now Nakamoto has a statue erected in his honor in Budapest, Hungary? The sculpture is made of bronze, and the face is made of a special material, so you can see your own face when you look at Satoshi. It signifies: \u201cWe are all Satoshi,\u201d according to the group behind the sculpture.\n\n**Fact #5: May 22 is Celebrated as Bitcoin Pizza Day Every Year**\n\nHistory was made on May 22nd, 2010 when Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas from Papa John\u2019s and paid 10,000 BTC for it (equivalent to about $40 at that time.) In today\u2019s price, that transaction would be word hundreds of millions of dollars. To commemorate this landmark event, May 22nd is celebrated each year as Bitcoin Pizza Day! \n\nHappy BTC Trading all!",
