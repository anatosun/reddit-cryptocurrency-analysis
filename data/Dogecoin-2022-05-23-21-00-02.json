He does not deny that Ukraine is being invaded and that Russia must be sanctioned for this war of aggression. But the conflict lies deeper. While the West, unchallenged (first and foremost the USA), has repeatedly broken the treaties, they have also expanded NATO to the east, contrary to the promise made to Russia. The West also rejected Putin at the beginning, when he tried to approach the West.\n\nThe whole thing is not an excuse. But the reporting is definitely very problematic, because in it the mistakes of the West are ignored. \n\nNeither the USA nor Europe started the war, but they laid the foundation with their behavior in the last decades.\n\nI say it again: Russia should be punished for this heinous crime.\n\nHowever, the fact that the West is now again pulling out of the affair is hypocritical. Because now people are suffering because of the mistakes of others.\nIt would be the same the other way around. Or would the West have allowed, for example, half of South America to join the Warsaw Pact after assurances that this would not happen?\n\nAlso, half of the West still maintains relations with Saudi Arabia in spite of its anti-human behavior.\n\nBy the way, Ukraine has also broken the arms stand several times (yes Russia too). \n\nSo it is a bit more complex than that. It would be news to me that Iraq, for example, has directly attacked the US.\n\nAnyway, I donated. But I understand the ulterior motive for not doing so.",
