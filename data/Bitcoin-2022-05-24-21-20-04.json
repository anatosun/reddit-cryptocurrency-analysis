                                            "response": "> The sooner English will stop being the global language the better\n\nEnglish came about as a creole of norse, anglo-frisian, and norman french, where existing conquered people adapted to the language of the victors mostly do to personal individual motives. It already has a history of being a common tongue. It spread largely to the huge global political power of imperial england, then by the american hegemon. \n\nBut today, the preeminance of english the language no longer has to do with english or american political might, nor the spattering of small english speaking nations like singapore, nor the great quantity of  english speakers in india. Now it is the corpus itself, the coded body of material, which gives it utility. The sheer volume of material, from entertainment, documentation, and science, which is done in English, and that fact that it is mostly digitally stored for perfect reproduction,  means the language has a permanent place near the top of language popularity. Even digital and internet communications is English first, with ascii being the first and simplest to encode of any glyphs.\n\nWhile it is a very complex and difficult language to be proficient in, it has some aspects of simplicity, and few accidents of history made it easy to spread technologically. The simplest writing system of any allowed to to easy to digitize. The lack of tones, insensitivity to vowel errors, and simple basic grammar allows it to be easily set to any music, and easily adapted to most speakers phoneme set. These are features expected in a creole.\n\nAlso, technology has shrunken the globe. The network effect tends to dominate in highly connected systems. In a poorly connected system, languages tend to rapidly deviate, such as the bloom of altcoins of every color and style. Just as bitcoin will one day kill all altcoins, English or some future creole of it, will one day be the de-jure earth common tongue, which it is in fact already is for the most part.\n\nEnglish is the language of the sky and sea, required by all those who leave the shores. English is already the language of outer space, and all space farers expect to have their instruments, documentation, and comms all in english. \n\nI myself would have preferred a logical and simple language, such as esperanto, but it was not to be. English, with all its quirks and warts, and become the official language of humanity. Since the world is fully interconnected, it may be too late to change that. The network effect guarantees that more value flows into english every day, at the expense of alternative languages. Everyday, alt languages shrink and lose value, becoming less relevant to the lives of future humans. I dont know when, but one day alt languages will become little more than historical artifacts to be studied as a hobby.\n\nI'm afraid the goose is cooked.",

It started in spring 2007 when within 30 minutes of each other I watched the yahoo news had on a charity begging for mosquito nets as children were dying and a advertizement for overstocked nets 95% off. The problem was the  country had no currency exchange with the second that needed the nets and physical usd was the only thing the first could receive as there was no digital network for that country. The problem I was focused on and trying to solve was the trust issue as the nations didn't trust each other and children were dying. I spent almost 6 months researching different digital networks paypal and so on trying to find a solution concluding there wasn't one avalible. Next I figued I would design a concept then get funding for someone to build a team to try and put it together, it's when I formed that Satoshi Nakomoto psudonym with emails and all the stuff needed.  This is the same time when I talked with Nick Szabo. His name was the first one I came across when doing history research in digital currencies. I had discussed with him how \"we\", meaning me and the team I was going to put together, were working on a concept similar to his but using pow based on unlikely chanced dublicate blocks and was going to use a agreed on ledger to bypass the need for trust. In early 2008 I was dealing with trying to manage the financial crisis, like most people, but I was also still formulating how the digital exchange and currency should work. So I sent emails to a group of crypto currency people, most of which were not encouraging, that's why I decided I would just have to start coding myself. I decided to use c++ as it's one of the few languaged I don't have published code for and decided to use free publically avalible tools as anyone could acess them. I decided to start with the ledger and the encryption. I decided to use sha256 as it was openly avalible and latter versions had issues. I had seen Back had built something similar to what I was building and decided I would immitate him including writing style and computer settings. I  couldn't get it exact though as other factors that go into random generation were out of my control. Hal seemed to be the only one intrested so I recurited him into the work team, which was now 2. We communicated quite often via a messenger often I would pick his brain with questions then go look up what was known or avalible as code I could draw ideas from. I was also still learning to code C++ at that time and trying to recruit help. Anyways off topic now and I don't have my ghost writer anymore so the main point is this smack in the face of the very concept of digital currency as it should be just like paper backs.",
