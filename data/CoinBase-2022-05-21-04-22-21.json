            "selftext": "I\u2019ve been using Coinbase for over a year, without any problems.\n\nA few days ago, I bought $20 of Luna. You never know\u2026\n\nRight after that, my account requested a new ID verification. I submitted my Swiss national ID.\n\nHowever, I live in France, and Coinbase requires ID from the country of residency, not origin.\n\nI do not have a French ID because I am not French. I am Swiss.\n\nI called Coinbase phone support and submitted a support request. Support sent me a link to verify my ID again. I did that, but got exactly the same rejection: \u201cCountry of residence does not match country of ID documents submitted.\u201d\n\nI also tried to change the country to Switzerland. But Coinbase requests that I first remove 2\u20ac in my cash balance first. However, because my account is now restricted pending ID verification, I cannot withdraw or use the cash to buy crypto. Catch-22.\n\nThere must be many people who live in a country different from their nationality. But Google and Reddit searches did not turn up any solutions, only a few people who have had the same problem.\n\nAny ideas?",
