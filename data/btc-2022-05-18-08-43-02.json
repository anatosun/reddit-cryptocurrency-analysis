The annoying thing is, I actually agree with a lot of what you say about crypto in general and so do many people here as well. I actually enjoy reading your sub and agree with a lot of what is said in there, but all you can do is come here, literally the only censorship free crypto sub and spew your bullshit as you know you won't be banned like you would in any of the other subs.\n\nI've seen how you guys operate.. you flat out ban anybody from your sub that might have any good arguments (like merchants and people who use crypto as peer to peer cash), and let all the dumb \"too the moon\" crypto bros stay, with their stupid arguments just so you can all feel like you are right about it all. I mean TBH you are right about most of what you say, but you come here attacking people that are not treating this all as a ponzi or get rich quick scheme, who have done nothing but try and carry on using it as intended.\n\nYou are speaking about L2 above like we are fans of it, we are not. Do you even realise what sub you are in? Or actually understand any of the history of the BTC and BCH fork and blocksize wars/debate? We are the people trying to use crypto as intended, peer to peer cash. Onboarding merchants, accepting it as payment etc.. the people you guys mock, we hate just as much as you do. When you couldn't win your bad faith debate with me in the past, you resorted to calling me a fentanyl dealer, and after our chat in DM you said maybe I am using crypto in a correct way, but I am the only person doing that and a tiny minority.. this whole sub is mostly full of people like me trying our best to keep carrying on the goal of peer to peer cash, and yes we are a tiny minority in the crypto space now days.\n\nThe way you operate your sub, banning anybody with a decent argument and leaving the stupid crypto bros there with an I'm a moron tag is just creating a giant echo chamber, you are almost as bad as the people you mock. I think I probably made about two comments in there (long ago) before I was banned, you can't handle a proper debate with anybody that actually uses crypto properly, you end up throwing your toys out of the pram and stamping your feet like a child. You're nothing but a hypocritical troll. You use censorship to make sure the only crypto people in buttcoin, are the dumbest of the dumb, to push your anti crypto agenda, I honestly can't imagine how sad your life must be to dedicate so much time to something you don't like or care about. We also hate the \"number go up\" people.\n\nI understand why you hate crypto as a whole but why constantly come here and attack the type of people that are actually trying to use it as intended, who have done for years?\n\nThe reason is because you are likely banned from any other crypto subs, and from your comments I don't think you even understand what the people in this sub are about at all.\n\nImagine only being able to win your debates in your own sub by censoring anybody with half a brain, and purposely letting dumb as fuck crypto bros stay in there to suit your agenda.\n\nYou are almost as bad as the folks over at r/bitcoin\n\nu/MobTwo this guy needs tagging as a Buttcoin mod, people need to know before engaging.",

I asked them to tag you not ban, so people know what they are getting into when you start debating in bad faith (like you tag people in your sub). Yes banning people that have good arguments for actual use cases for crypto from your sub while allowing those idiotic crypto bro types there is censorship and just further suits your anti crypto agenda. Why not just let the downvotes do the talking??\n\nYou simply only want crypto bros there who present stupid arguments.\n\nI mean I myself get a laugh out of a lot of it TBH.\n\nJust like them though, you can't see past the \"investment\" side of crypto.\n\nNobody in this sub is the type of person who says \"have fun staying poor\".\n\nYou are thinking of toxic BTC maximalists from subs like r/bitcoin.\n\nI spent hours debating you before and gave you many good arguments for using crypto as peer to peer cash, I know full well you remember this, we took it to DM after you accused me of being a drug dealer. You even admitted that I might use it properly, but I am the only person that does and that I'm a tiny minority. You can check your own posts in this sub and your own DMs if you need a refresher.\n\nMaybe you genuinely forgot about this, but I doubt it.\n\nAgain, I'm not going over the masses of good arguments I already gave you both in this sub and in DM in the past, you can simply read them again instead of trying to get me to type it all out again. Sure I call you names, you deserve it, you are a hypocritical self absorbed little troll, who enjoys creating an echo chamber about something he hates to make himself feel better, and comes to other communities trying to annoy others.\n\nYes you guys censored me in Buttcoin.. but are happy to keep stupid crypto bros there, and any crypto lover that basically makes themselves look stupid when they debate you, I've seen it in real time and it's pathetic. I've proved for over a decade crypto can be useful to some people as a payment system.. though I agree that the majority of the crypto space is just a giant ponzi scheme and casino full of degenerate gamblers.\n\nI don't think you understand this sub well, it's not your average Bitcoin/crypto sub. It's mostly populated by people that agree with many Buttcoin points, that were into Bitcoin early on and always pushed for it's use case of peer to peer cash, before the masses came along after being told by the media and others it would make them rich.\n\nVery few of us here are fans of the coin BTC any more due to how it ended up.\n\nIf you were actually interested you could easily look into the history of what happened, but I assume you are not interested and only interested in trolling crypto as a whole, you speak to us in here like we are stupid degenerate gamblers, which isn't the case.\n\nThe goal and narrative of Bitcoin (BTC) was completely changed.\n\nMost of us like coins such as BCH and XMR that are widely used as actual p2p cash.\n\nWe are not buying crypto, \"HODLing\" and hoping to get rich.\n\nThough I understand how it can be confusing with the sub named r/btc.",

At least he didn't literally steal hashrate intended to be pointed at BTC and point it at BCH to accomplish this.\n\nBy the way, you got the exact hardfork you wanted. You just didn't get the ticker. Still, no one wants your centralized shitcoin.\n\nWhat's even more ironic is that you have now forever crippled BTC's argument for larger blocks because they will just point at the disaster that is BCH when anyone tries to bring that idea up. Way to forever confirm all the fears of the big block side with your centralized big block bitcoin.",

Since ETH has more TPS, it has more fee revenue. Since that should lead to improved security, a bigger block-size fits in nowadays. Without the split, big-blockers could probably have achieved **2x** by now, by convincing the community to increase the limit.\n\nI personally think that both ETH (**14 TPS**) & BTC (**3 TPS**) are full of **spam**. BCH (**0.6 TPS**) encourages real humans to use it as much as humanly possible, and that isn't even a **fifth** of BTC's throughput. It's *ridiculous*!\n\nAccording to the spam theory, a bigger block-size is needed to fund the miners. Both ETH & BTC both have similar (within **40%**) fee for median simple transfer. The spammers don't want ordinary folk to pay too much, so a bigger block-size implies more spam revenue. It's like a small-blocker **compromise**.\n\n**Edit**: One of us could spam BCH at 3 TPS for under $200/day. (Tbh +1 TPS would look less suspicious.) Buy a whole bunch of BCHUP or BCHBULL (leveraged tokens) and then do a little pump n dump. BTC & ETH holders probably did this, but decided they'd only pump & never dump (their coins). Hence their blockchains are full of spam. It's a **gamblers' tragedy**!",
