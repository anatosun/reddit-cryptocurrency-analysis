            "selftext": "The otherside mint taught me and many others a few lessons; Ethereum is not ready for mass adoption, L2 rollups are the only thing helping it survive and people are sick of paying their kidneys in fees for the sake of good security. Good security should never cost this much, if it does, it means that your \u201cWorld Computer\u201d needs upgrades. And every singe upgrade needs 8 years of purity testing to go forward, and it\u2019s not like Ethereum will get cheaper with the merge. \n\nThis has led many people, even Yuga Labs who dropped the otherside mint on ETH, to consider other chains, chains that will not break when you\u2019re minting a 100,000 NFTs all at once. How do we fix this? We explore better alternatives until Ethereum catches up, and if it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll just congratulate it on the good run. I\u2019ve been exploring AVAX since it launched, LUNA till it crashed, Polygon, and now Cartesi as they\u2019ve literally built a blockchain OS on Linux VM. \n\nit\u2019s super fun to see where crypto is heading, everyone is exploring literally every single coding language to build the perfect chain. This is great, it brings more people to the space, more institutional money for big firms that missed out on ETH, and will be a great catalyst to kicking off the bull market sooner than ever.",

It's still the most decentralized, secure & robust chain in the space, and the L2s tap from Ethereum security.\n\nWondering what would be the fate of the other L1s when L2s start taking their market share; the likes of Arbitrum, Optimism, StarkNet, Metis, Zksync & Cartesi would most likely gain huge traction.\n\nPs: StarkNet even raised 100M USD recently \\[in a bear market\\] at 8bn USD valuation, so it's obvious where the next liquidity will flow.",

First rollups of Cartesi will run on Polygon actually.. so we can call CTSI a layer3 basically. Also, when their BlockchainOS solution will become fully functional, the adoption will see a real boost - more and more regular software developers will jump onto the blockchain\u2026",
