The hate towards Bitcoin, the ignorance that I am witnessing there pains me.\n\nI want to help my Canadians understand money. I want them to understand how Fiat money works and why we are operating in a system which by design will always fail. I want to teach them how the fight is not Left vs Right, but Top vs Bottom. Teach them how if we can fix the money, we can fix the world. But I am overwhelmed by ignorance, people who think Bitcoin is an investment and do not understand how we are progressing through the evolution of what money is:\n\n1. Collectable\n2. Store of value\n3. Medium of      exchange\n4. Unit of account\n\nI am trying my best to help my Countrymates, but the FUD is strong, and the media has clearly done an excellent job at pushing false narratives. I hope we can help teach, use resources such as [endthefud.org](https://endthefud.org) to help.\n\nI want a better Canada, I want a better world, I want to take the money away from the governments.  Liberty for all.",

Nobody likes to hear that their thoughts are wrong.\n\nBut also, as an investor since 2012, I encourage you to ignore the fud yourself mentally and emotionally. \n\nThe way I see it, haters are gonna hate and the people who understand and participate are what makes the system stronger. \n\nAnd most importantly, the best thing you can do is vote vote vote. Look out for candidates who are against bitcoin and vote against them. Support candidates that are for what you believe in. (I don\u2019t mean that carte blanche though, our stupid senator is all Yeehaw about bitcoin but destroying our state with his stupid religious antidotes, he can get bent.)",

                    "response": "Alts are more exciting for newcomers. People have heard the stories of early Bitcoin users becoming very wealthy and they want that as well. By getting in on the ground floor on the next big thing, not by hopping along for the ride for something already in motion.\n\nAlts also have much more marketing. Altcoin developers frequently actively search out media for coverage. Premined coins have a \"development fund\" that can be used to buy \"partnerships\". If you're crypto-curious, looking for profit and you see articles with titles like \"New altcoin XYZ now partnered with SomeCompany. Could it be the next big thing?\", then that's appealing. \n\nBitcoin, by comparison, is boring. In a good way, but still. It chugs along at a rate of 6 blocks per hour. It's reliable, but not flashy. There's plenty of development going on, but very little marketing.\n\nWhen everyone has their eyes on the moon, the flashy new altcoins look very good. But when things come crashing down, boring and reliable beats flashy every day of the week.",

It\u2019s in fact the opposite, we got off the gold standard 2 decades before the Great Depression in order to finance WW1. Bad monetary policy is what led to the depression, and then Keynesian clown economics was pushed as a justification of endless money printing to finance war at the expense of common people\u2019s savings purchasing power.\n\nPeople have plenty of reasons to spend money whether they expect the purchasing power to go up or down, doesn\u2019t change their wants or needs. It just simplifies how they save their money in a sound money system instead of having to become an expert on financial and commodities markets, you just save hard money and spend it when you want/need to.",

The spiral destroys businesses and jobs.\n\nContracts are written, salaries are negotiated and capital is financed at a given price level.  When that price level deflates, the profitability of business goes with it.  Jobs go, money becomes tighter and the spiral continues killing more businesses as prices fall further.\n\nWhen you are talking about the type of deflationary velocity that comes with a 100x, no one is going to be able to consistently predict price levels accurately.  Even if they do, competing producers who underestimate deflation will attract workers and capital.  It is damned if you do and damned if you don't, and as we learned from the depression it is workers who bear the burden.  They are the ones leveraged by the starvation of their families.",

Bitcoin can indeed fail and is indeed an experiment.\n\n5) Maximalism is simply an underlying understanding in the recognition that there will be one dominant currency (just like we have now with USD). Maximalism is simply an understanding of economics regardless the benefits or tradeoffs. It is simply more secure and more efficient to deal in one currency than barter between many currencies.\n\n6) Maximalists prefer to spend their efforts on one project because they have a greater understanding of the stakes and risks and rather insure one sovereign and secure currency succeeds rather than diluting ones efforts in many insecure and incomplete efforts which all fail",
