Bitcoin started when I was still in middleschool and by the time I finished high-school and starting college I had student loans and my first laptop but by then mining was on specialized rigs. I think those that didn't have financial freedom or were the legal age to trade when bitcoin was lower priced and are only getting in this last year or so didn't \"deserve\" the higher prices, just didn't have a choice. And what about those that live in countries with poor internet access? Hardly can say they deserve to have missed out on scooping up cheap sats.\n\nNow those that have some money to invest and are semi financially literate, as well as old enough to have started when it was taking off but chose not too? They're getting the price they deserve.",
