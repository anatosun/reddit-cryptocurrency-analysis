The trouble I have is the more I research into different coins and their use cases the more I want to invest.\n\nHowever I\u2019m starting off small using the DCA (dollar cost average) strategy but the more assets I invest in ultimately reduced the amount I\u2019m investing in each.\n\nI\u2019m particularly having trouble deciding which unique block chain to invest in and which metaverse asset to invest in.\n\nI\u2019m willing to hold the coin and wait for the future.\n\nIs it bad to have too many? Only inputting a small amount across lots of assets?",

It's nice to see the point made that bitcoin mining can economically incent the development of more base-load electricity generation capacity and simultaneously reduce the demand for generation by high-pollution peaker plants by being so flexible in its demand.",

It is measured in TWH, which makes it comparable to bitcoin mining consumption (at 188TWH/year):\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/energy-mix\n\nFrom 2009 to 2019, global consumption went from 145,881 TWH to 173,340 TWH.  An increase of 27,459 TWH.  188 of that was bitcoin mining.  \n\nBitcoin mining is currently around 0.1% of consumption, and accounts for about 0.6% of the energy consumption increase in the 10 years from 2009 to 2019.\n\nIf you care about reducing energy consumption, there are much bigger targets.",

Bitcoin started when I was still in middleschool and by the time I finished high-school and starting college I had student loans and my first laptop but by then mining was on specialized rigs. I think those that didn't have financial freedom or were the legal age to trade when bitcoin was lower priced and are only getting in this last year or so didn't \"deserve\" the higher prices, just didn't have a choice. And what about those that live in countries with poor internet access? Hardly can say they deserve to have missed out on scooping up cheap sats.\n\nNow those that have some money to invest and are semi financially literate, as well as old enough to have started when it was taking off but chose not too? They're getting the price they deserve.",
