The trouble I have is the more I research into different coins and their use cases the more I want to invest.\n\nHowever I\u2019m starting off small using the DCA (dollar cost average) strategy but the more assets I invest in ultimately reduced the amount I\u2019m investing in each.\n\nI\u2019m particularly having trouble deciding which unique block chain to invest in and which metaverse asset to invest in.\n\nI\u2019m willing to hold the coin and wait for the future.\n\nIs it bad to have too many? Only inputting a small amount across lots of assets?",

And what about those that live in countries with poor internet access? Hardly can say they deserve to have missed out on scooping up cheap sats.\n\nNow those that have some money to invest and are semi financially literate, as well as old enough to have started when it was taking off but chose not too?

It's nice to see the point made that bitcoin mining can economically incent the development of more base-load electricity generation capacity and simultaneously reduce the demand for generation by high-pollution peaker plants by being so flexible in its demand.",
