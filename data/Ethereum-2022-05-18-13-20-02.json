I understand it's not the favoured rollup solution to scaling but at the end of the day they've released a working solution that solves a big problem. And have found a way to at least utilise ethereum's security.\n\nIf it wasn't for Polygon, I know a lot of people wouldn't have been able to get into DeFi due to high fees and would still be waiting for rollups to get adopted. I don't think it's justified to shit on a team that's helping to increase DeFi adoption. Plus, I'm pretty sure most people barely understand (or care) about the different between scaling solutions like ZK rollups, optimistic rollups, or commit chains.",
