I haven't yet checked their most recent thoughts on this. \n\nBut it doesn't change the fact the whole chain is decentralized, due to the fact L2s can't, by definition, take away your funds (just know and be careful about the temporary vulnerabilities of each of them, right now) and you can still copy paste their smart contracts and compete. \n\nIf governments try to push for harder and harder regulations, I'd totally expect some L2s to stop it all and completely decentralize their processes. Sure, they'd still need a pretty small number of people to process the transactions so that it's still scalable, but it would still be pretty secure compared to centralized L2s. It's not very different from the size you'd need for a DAO. And since decentralized smart contract management is classically handled by a DAO anyway, you could even have L2s specialized for a given DAO and smart contracts it handles.",
