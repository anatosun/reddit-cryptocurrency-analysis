            "selftext": "The really crazy, radical experiment in money, isn't Bitcoin..\n\nIn the last six years there has been an absolutely radical experiment in money, and that is, that in the first time in history, central banks took interest rates to zero.\n\nAnd it wasn't just one of them, even though it was unprecedented, but 21 central banks have taken the interest rates to zero. Left it there for 6 years. And cannot raise it again, because if they raised it a tiny bit.. the entire economy would collapse.\n\nThis has never happened before.\n\nIt's the most radical monetary policy experiment since the introduction of central banking in the 1920's. We don't know how it will end But in most likelyhood it will not end well..\n\nIn monetary terms what we have done at this point, is like giving someone, giving the economy, an intravenous cocaine drip on full blast.\nFor 6 years.\n\nAnd at some point there is going to be a hangover. And it is going to be brutal, because now the patient is barely awake on a full drip of cocaine.\n\nAnd we are running out of cocaine..",

On their conditions they require me to pay around 8$ in fees monthly, on top of having 15-25% interest for any purchases (that\u2019s 15-25% on top the money I\u2019ve spend through the card). That\u2019s not all, cash and bank transfers to card will cost either 5$ or 5% of total transaction on card.\n\nNow take AMM. You deposit money, get positive huge apy. You borrow, you get POSITIVE APY (meaning you have to return less than the amount you\u2019ve borrowed). \n\nTalk about which financial system is better.",
