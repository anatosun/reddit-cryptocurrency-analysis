Rather than use my normal debit card (which would defeat the point) I am planning to get a prepaid debit card or visa gift card, or equivalent. \n\nDoes anyone here have experience with this? I've heard some of these cards might close out your account while you still have money on them, or might not let you purchase from an exchange. Is this true? What cards do you recommend using or avoiding?",
