It **should** be _boring af_.\n\nSo the circle is round and all is good, even though it sucks sometimes when the narrative is \"nothing\". I think if you look at the discussion we're having [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/uzv6ci/how_can_i_help_dogecoin/) which is **only** about a single protocol feature, you get an idea of the untapped potential. There are not only many more protocol features that no one uses today, there are also many that we could merge in with relative ease.\n\nI actually in 2020 set out to do that kind of work. I wasn't looking to get back into developing Dogecoin Core, I wanted to tap that potential of the protocol and just develop cool things. But it must be enabled and backed by a good software, or else we can forget about it. One of the things that I ran into early 2020 was that my custom built node I was developing for a series of products I wanted to build was having problems syncing up a mere 5000 blocks from any random Dogecoin Core node: it was just so slow! It took me weeks to find that on a 1.10.0 node, my stuff was working fine, and it was much much faster. Unfortunately we were 85% into a softfork that would depreciate 1.10... so something had to be done.\n\nThis is why I am here now (well, that and u/Sporklin's insistence), but this situation should never be happening to other devs that try to build something cool. It takes up so much effort when you think you can just do something and ultimately you find that there's simply a couple of bad bugs in the software that every node on the network runs, and prevent you from doing the sweet stuff. That's what's Dogecoin Core ultimately is about: provide a really good, reliable network of nodes that enable whatever crazy things you can think of. \n\nAnd that's what currently we work on: the network. Boring af, but fulfilling nonetheless \ud83d\ude01",
