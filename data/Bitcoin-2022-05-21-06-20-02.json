You are still going to be making a minimum of 10x. do you really care if you missed a low by 10k? Not if BTC goes to $400,000.\n\nIt doesn't matter! You are in this for the long run and all of this noise just makes the ride uncomfortable. Take the higher path and don't look or listen to fear. Have a who the fuck cares attitude. You'll end up a hellava lot richer than you are today and a happy person for being apathetic all long the way.",

Chalk it down to a life experience. If they ever hit my buy in cost, I\u2019ll sell them and leave it there. Then I started to deep dive into bitcoin using the What Bitcoin Did beginners guide series and realised everything else was actually a shitcoin. I then started buying bitcoin again in 2019 and still planned to exchange my shitcoins for bitcoin when they hit par but I ended up doing it at a loss because I didn\u2019t want to Hodl anything else. Some of those coins, top ten in the 2017/18 run, never hit my average buy in during this last run.",

It depends how you think about it.\n\nNo, it really isn't just how you think about it. \n\nIf you have $100, you can buy 500 things that cost $0.20. If those things become worth $10 each, you now have $5,000 worth of those things. You turned $100 into $5,000.\n\nIf you buy $100 worth of something that costs $0.60 each, you can buy 166 of them (with $0.40 left over). If those things become worth $10 each, you now have $1,660.40 worth of those things. You turned $100 into $1,660.40, which is great! It's $3,339.60 less than if you were able to buy them for $0.20, though.",
