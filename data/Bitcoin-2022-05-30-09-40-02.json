The process of initial price discovery has to be volatile.\n\nSecond, imagine after 5000 years of gold being money and goods being priced in gold we then turned around and said golds too volatile to be money. Obviously if things were priced in gold again then fiat would become the volatile thing.\n\nLook at the forex market. Just because the YEN is volatile against the USD doesnt mean things in Japan cant be priced in YEN. The YEN is volatile against USD yet in Japan a car is priced in YEN and every day the amount of YEN for that car doesnt change yet the amount USD that car would be selling for would be different every day because the USD is volatile against the YEN. \n\nIn 5 years bitcoin will be larger and less volatile than the YEN meaning it will absolutely be capable of being money and becoming the denominator goods are priced in.
