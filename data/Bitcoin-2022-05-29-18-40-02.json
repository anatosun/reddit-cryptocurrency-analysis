The site was not some sort of free public service; it was a for-profit enterprise, and he made millions of dollars from it.\n\nISPs and phone networks are typically not held liable to what is transmitted on them in many countries... but not all, and not in all circumstances. In the US, for instance, cloud storage services are required by law to scan their servers for child abuse images, and all of them do so. ISPs block access to CP sites in many countries, and most countries monitor and restrict communications on the Internet and mobile networks and block criminal activity.\n\nIn most countries the sale, purchase and use of weapons including firearms is regulated for obvious reasons.\n\nFacilitating criminal activity with the intent to do so is often a crime. Ulbricht is clearly guilty of conspiracy. He worked with others to sell narcotics through the site, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics is a federal crime. He moved millions in dollars in bitcoin through the site, generated by sales of illegal goods and services, and that is money laundering.\n\nThe murder-for-hire allegations were not proven in court but appear to be completely plausible.\n\nThe fact that is family has raised millions of dollars to try to free this person is disgusting. He is a predator who exploited others and hurt countless people. He should rot.",

It can be compromised by false evidence, tampering, or perjury--but the existence of such must *in turn* be proven. \n\nCapone wasn't guilty of murder because no one could PROVE that he had actually murdered... NOR that he had people murdered on his behalf via explicit command, *quid pro quo*, etc. It's that simple. \n\nIt wasn't for lack of trying from the prosecutors--it's that literally nobody, to this day, knows whether or not he was actually guilty of murder.

You're telling me that if you see someone steal your backpack, you consider them innocent all the way up until the moment they are proven guilty in a court of law? Yeah, sure you do.\n\nPro tip: \"Presumption of innocence\" is *nothing more* than a **legal** standard. It exists to ensure that the *state* must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in order to *convict* someone of a crime. It means that a prosecutor can't walk into a trial, wink at the jury, say, \"We all know he did it, let's just get this over with quick, I rest my case\" and be done with it. That's what \"presumed innocent\" means, and that's *all* it means.\n\n>It's a universal rule you should give to everyone.\n\nNo, it's a rule that prosecutors and juries must give to everyone. Not random people on the internet.\n\nIt has literally *nothing* to do with anyone's personal judgement. If I watch a person commit murder right in front of me, I don't have to wait until the state proves anything in order to call that person guilty. All this other bullshit about it being a \"universal rule\" that people on the internet must morally apply to a situation is pure comedy. As human beings we're allowed to look at facts and make judgements, like we do all the time in order to navigate our daily lives. We just can't put people in jail for them.",

Force, 46, a 15-year veteran of the Drug Enforcement Administration who resigned last year, and Shaun W. Bridges, 32, a special agent with the Secret Service who resigned this month, made their first appearances in court Monday after the unsealing of the criminal complaint in California\n\n> Both were members of the Baltimore Silk Road Task Force, which authorities have said was one of two concurrent federal investigations into the world's most popular \u2014 and now defunct \u2014 online drug bazaar. Their work helped lead to two indictments against alleged Silk Road founder and administrator Ross William Ulbricht\n\n> Authorities also believe Bridges was behind a theft from Silk Road that led Ulbricht to allegedly commission a murder-for-hire, a charge Ulbricht still faces in Maryland.\n\n> Ulbricht was convicted in February in New York of charges including drug trafficking and money laundering and is awaiting sentencing. His attorney, Joshua L. Dratel, said the charges against Force and Bridges bolster his client's argument for a new trial.\n\nAlso this, from freeross.org\n\n> The accusations relied on anonymous chats never proven to have been authored by Ross. Hard evidence and testimony\u2014including from the lead Silk Road investigator\u2014show that multiple administrators (DPRs) operated the site (meaning they had access to the same chat logs). Two corrupt investigators (sent to prison) also had unfettered access to Silk Road and were admittedly involved in numerous plots.\nRoss has always denied these allegations, and even Curtis Green, the only alleged victim ever identified, is a longtime, fervent supporter of Ross\u2019s release.",

I'm not sure how much you already know about the guy, but I have the following info and am waiting on getting his address.\" DPR provided a name for FriendlyChemist and stated that he lived in White Rock, British Columbia, Canada, with \"Wife+ 3 kids.\" DPR added: \"Let me know if it would be helpful to have his full address.\"\n\n> Several hours later on March 29, 2013, DPR sent a message to \"redandwhite,\" stating that \"FriendlyChemist\" is \"causing me problems,\" and adding: \"I would like to put a bounty on his head if it's not too much trouble for you. What would be an adequate amount to motivate you to find him? Necessities like this do happen from time to time for a person in my position.\"\n\nUnless the FBI fabricated all those chat logs, he was clearly ordering a murder.\n\nThe [other document](https://ia600406.us.archive.org/17/items/gov.uscourts.mdd.238311/gov.uscourts.mdd.238311.4.0.pdf) I linked to also has some juicy murder-for-hire chat logs (page 6):\n\n> \"DPR,\" asked the UC to arrange for the Employee to be beaten and forced to return the\nmoney, stating specifically, \"I'd like him beat up, then forced to send the bitcoins he stole back. like sit him down at his computer and make him do it[.]\"\n\n> \"DPR\" communicated with the UC via the Internet, and asked: \"can you change the order to execute rather than torture?\" \"DPR\" wrote that the Employee \"was on the inside for a while, and now that he's been arrested, I'm afraid he'll give up info[,]\" and added that he had \"never killed a man or had one killed before, but it is the right move in this case.\"\n\n> \"DPR\" caused approximately $40,000 to be wired from Technocash Limited in Australia to a bank account at Capital One Bank in Washington, D.C., as payment for the murder of the Employee.\n\nAgain, unless the FBI made this all up, it doesn't look good for Ross.",

And he was a complete amateur with networks and with security. Using the same public WiFi for months was the final straw because that's where they nabbed his computer before he could close the lid encrypting things forever. Baffling it took them that long to catch him though. Wouldn't have hurt if he showed the slightest modicum of remorse during sentencing. \n\nAll the same, time served, I want him out now.

Then they used Green's password to steal money from DPR, implicating Green in the process. That led to DPR becoming worried that Green had given him up (which was true) and convinced him that Green was stealing from him. Which then led to Force being able to pose as a hitman and offer DPR first to beat up Green, and then stage Green's murder.\n\nSo basically it was an elaborate ploy from government agents to convince DPR that his employee was stealing from him, and offer to beat him up and assassinate him. I suspect this was the reason DPR was never convicted of attempted murder, it was a setup from the start, in order to lead DPR to think that he has no choice but to order a hit. It didn't stand as evidence in court because both agents were found dirty, but the fact that \"DPR ordered a hit\" is widely repeated to implicate that DPR was rightfully convicted, although he was never convicted for ordering a hit.\n\nhttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/inside-silk-road-staged-assassinations",

Rates of drug use would be much higher if this were the case. People point to the Prohibition Era and say \"see look, prohibition didn't work for alcohol, it won't work for heroin.\" But what they miss about the Prohibition era is that rates of alcohol abuse actually did decline. Drug laws are actually preventing us from having a way worse drug problem. They just have to modified to stop people from ending up in prison for having personal drugs.",
