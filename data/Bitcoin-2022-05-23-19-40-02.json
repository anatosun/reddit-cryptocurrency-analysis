Good content about flared gas here https://youtu.be/kiiLzsleuwU.

Further, in 100 years when this is all predicted to happen, humanity will be much better adapted to rising sea levels and warmer climates, unless we remain a low energy species, then we are sure to die off in the inevitable environmental change.",

There are points where they talk about how someone needs to be \"in charge of\" and \"responsible for\" the value of money. They given no further explanation, but simply posit the idea as a way to describe why Bitcoin cannot be money.\n\nIt's so blatantly contradictory to someone with a deeper knowledge of Bitcoins game theory, but what really scares me is their blatant attempts to call it a ponzi scheme while being careful not to directly say it. They talk more generally about \"pyramids\" in \"blockchain assets\" and then make sure to say something about Bitcoin right after, saying something like it's a \"real asset\" but \"not money\".\n\nI wasn't too concerned about CBDC's before recently and I still mostly see skeptics in this community as being a bit too conspiracy theorist... but there really is something to be worried about here. The people in these institutions are so disingenuous and are, at best, out of touch with the world. They are going to come down hard on Bitcoin with narratives and bad money with good rails.\n\nIt's more important than ever that Bitcoin becomes easier to understand and use.",
