There are points where they talk about how someone needs to be \"in charge of\" and \"responsible for\" the value of money. They given no further explanation, but simply posit the idea as a way to describe why Bitcoin cannot be money.\n\nIt's so blatantly contradictory to someone with a deeper knowledge of Bitcoins game theory, but what really scares me is their blatant attempts to call it a ponzi scheme while being careful not to directly say it. They talk more generally about \"pyramids\" in \"blockchain assets\" and then make sure to say something about Bitcoin right after, saying something like it's a \"real asset\" but \"not money\".\n\nI wasn't too concerned about CBDC's before recently and I still mostly see skeptics in this community as being a bit too conspiracy theorist... but there really is something to be worried about here. The people in these institutions are so disingenuous and are, at best, out of touch with the world. They are going to come down hard on Bitcoin with narratives and bad money with good rails.\n\nIt's more important than ever that Bitcoin becomes easier to understand and use.",

Bitcoin, just like every other currency, involves a network of trust that others will treat the ledger as if it holds value. This argument has been made by other Bitcoiners to explain why BCH and other forks don't magically hold their value regardless of being the same fixed supply monetary policy.\n\nWhere the IMF gets dishonest is when they say that this network of trust needs something \"backing\" it. In reality, given fiat is not actually \"backed\" by anything the only thing they are really doing is legalizing its use as an untaxed (in terms of capital gains) medium of exchange. In doing so, they grant themselves power to debase that medium of exchange as they see fit.\n\nInversely, Bitcoin draws trust from the fact that it doesn't give anyone the right to debase it. The remaining barrier is to reach a much larger, more stable market cap where the people can finally rise up and demand it be made a legal, untaxed medium of exchange. They will be left with no more excuses and it will either result in civil unrest or a relinquishing of power... and least that's my hope.",

Part of that is a multitude of apps that need to connect together (can you buy Bitcoin on muun wallet or do you have to buy somewhere else and then transfer it over? Etc). Part of it is the volatility (we just haven\u2019t grown large enough to really treat as more than a long term store of value).",

Generally, you have a lower cost overall, but it requires a big investment to get started, so you have to either have the money saved or get a loan.  Either will require a profitable history of mining, and presumably you were doing so with a lower form of energy like fossil fuels.  Telling people they can't mine with fossil fuels is essentially telling poorer people that they aren't allowed to join the club, and you give them no ability to work their way up the energy ladder.  Even if you want everyone to use renewable energy, increasing energy prices or regulating fossil fuels, despite appearances, will not help.  Further, natural gas produces like 3x less co2 per kWh than coal, its not fair to lump them in the same category.  Finally, as I eluded to earlier, fossil fuels are used for everything in modern life, if you believe in bitcoin then you agree that mining isn't wasted energy, it has as much a claim on producing CO2 as any other product.",
