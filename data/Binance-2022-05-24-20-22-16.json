The irony is that they can just talk about it, and I don't see it occurring, and even if they succeed, there are privacy projects whose goal is to make user transactions anonymous so they can't be tracked. Railgun recently went live on BSC, Ethereum, and Polygon, providing users with multichain flexibility. If I may say so, it's an amazing concept, but we'll have to wait and see what the future offers.",
