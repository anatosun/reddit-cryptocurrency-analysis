No one knows what the price is going to be, and although the price has dropped 50% from its all time high, there's still room to move downward. If you do your research and you believe in the sound money principles of bitcoin, my suggestion would be to buy a little bit every week or month, accumulate, and just have no plans to sell for a few years. I would suggest not buying and selling in short intervals.",
