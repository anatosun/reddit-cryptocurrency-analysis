Now, a Russian minister says that payments in crypto will also eventually be legal.**\n\n[https://cryptospection.com/russian-minister-crypto-payments-become-legal/](https://cryptospection.com/russian-minister-crypto-payments-become-legal/)",

Only since being excluded from the global banking system is Russia now posturing to adopt- I would take this apparent Russian adoption of BTC/crypto with a large grain of salt.\n\nIf they genuinely want freedom from USD fiat debt slavery and hegemony Bitcoin is available, ready, willing and able to provision fair, neutral and impartial international and domestic payments and SoV.\n\nInstead they seem more inclined to try every strategy to hold onto and increase their own capacities to exercise fiat monetary power and leverage.",

Shit, I got pulled over for DUI in Moscow years ago. No license valid there, paid the cop $100 and all good.",
