Pyotr Piron and Yevgeny Prigozhin threatened the victim by claiming he could face legal problems ahead if he didn't pay up. This comes after a district court allowed enforcement officers to seize stolen cryptocurrency in another criminal case.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Your coins have to be able to be spent freely whenever you want, Cheaply, and fast. Without compromising on safety.Is this possible?Should we increase the block size to do it on the main net? What block size would we need for bitcoin to run with a average transaction cost under 1 cent. I think 1 cent is a good transaction roof if you want to be able to use bitcoin for everything and anything. How much could we raise the block size without compromising safety or peoples ability to run their own full node?\n\nOr what could be done (maybe with a second layer) to be able to spend your coins freely, fast and cheaply without locking them up in for example a lightening network channel?\n\nFull disclaimer, i know about the block war, i know about the lightening network. This post is made because people are not using bitcoin, and i want to find the problem that causes it, and i want to find the solution to solve it. I think i know some of the problems, but i want to find the solutions, and maybe more of the problems (if there are any more).  \nAllso, this is not a big block post.",

That said, companies are working on ways to automate setting all of this up.\n\nBut using lightning as a consumer, either custodial or self-custodial, is fairly straight forward. I personally think custody solutions will be most widely used but will be treated more like a physical wallet where you put very small amounts into it at any given time.
