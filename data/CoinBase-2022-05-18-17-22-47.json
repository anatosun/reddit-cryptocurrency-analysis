I need it to be ETH. I don't have much wiggle room financially, so I need the cheapest way to swap currencies. \n\nShould I swap inside the wallet or move it to CB to trade? \n\nI know it will cost something to move to CB (so not cool!), but does it cost less to trade on CB than to swap in wallet?

DON'T use the CB Wallet; ever, until you have some experience in Crypto, and have some need to play in DeFi\n\nI have had my regular Coinbase Custody account since 2014 and have the CB Wallet with a couple bucks in it from signing up for it and never used it again and too lazy to delete it off my phone.\n\nLeave your stuff in Coinbase Custody until you have an uncomfortable amount (value) in it (or above the Fake FDIC insurance). Only then consider Hot Wallets and Cold Wallets (or better yet open a Coinbase account in spouses name then you have another 250K).\n\nIf you feel a need to play in DeFi, get a Algorand Wallet and play in their DeFI to learn it (or ADA, Cosmos/ATOM) something far less expensive to learn DeFi before playing in Ethereum's Ecosystem.\n\nAll I can say is Send the ETH over for the Gas to remove the coins, or just leave the coins until ETH2.0 in hoping that the fees become better.\n\nDO NOT get caught up in the \"Not Your Keys, Not Your Crypto\" BS; or the new stupid \"Coinbase is going bankrupt\" BS. Leave your coins on the regular Coinbase Custody app. If you \"need\" a Wallet for some reason, perticularly for longer term storage or to maintain your account below the insurance amount buy a Ledger Wallet.",

The scammers can be very convincing and there is NOTHING you can do afterwards.",
