                            "response": "One because of the other.  The term \"hard money\" is common here, and what it refers to is the difficult of producing the currency.  Historically, soft money devalues compared to hard money, the price of copper against silver has continuously dropped, the price of silver against gold has continuously dropped.  Producing bitcoin is exceedingly difficult, and the rate at which it can be produced is resistant to manipulation, new gold supply can be increased when gold prices go up, bitcoins difficulty can change so new bitcoin supply remains relatively fixed.  Because of this it is predictable and hard, its a natural effect of it being the hardest money that it will increase in value compared to lesser moneys.\n\nTaking advantage of this is just like taking advantage of how the economics of buying a home or car change when the federal reserve changes rates, or buying an electric car because you know gas will only go up given the political landscape.  Whatever your moral outlook is on these matters, there's money to be made by taking advantage of them.  I don't think anyone wants bitcoin because its better money, people want bitcoin because they want to get rich, the reason they will likely win out is because bitcoin is a better money.",

Then, invert the cup and allow the liquid to drain.\n\nNow, it is time to flip the cup right-side up and read the tea leaves.
