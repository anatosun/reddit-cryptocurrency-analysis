My question is, since an NFT is just a url, couldn't anyone have minted this NFT or does it have to be the owner?\n\nIs it possible for another NFT to be created using the same url using the same or different blockchain. If this is the case, and you can literally create the same NFT, why would it be worth anything?",

An NFT emitted by Jack Dorsey himself (or an organisation he would lend credence to) is worth something for the mere fact that it has a social connection at is basis - the endorsement / identity of the emittent.\n\nWhy this fact makes a massive difference is lost on many people.

However, the \u201ccollectibles\u201d market (which this would fall into) would likely want an authentic tweet (I.e. the tweet is minted by the account owner). Non authentic NFT-tweets would affect pricing and marketability of the NFT. Ensuring authentication would require some form of KYC layered into the minter\u2019s wallet to prove it is associated with the Twitter account owner. There\u2019s likely a market opportunity to build something that connects the KYC details for people to layer-1s so L1s can connect to something functioning as an \u201cidentity oracle\u201d such that they can confirm identity of wallet owners without actually knowing or possessing any personally identifying information (e.g. a zero knowledge proof)\n\nThen there is the issue of IP rights and whether minting another person\u2019s tweets violates copyright. And who owns a tweet\u2019s IP? Twitter or the account owner?\n\nYou are correct about being able to mint any nft on another layer-1. Blockchains are just databases. You can add an entry to the \u201cledger\u201d on any layer-1 representing a tweet NFT. Who knows how to mitigate that issue but I agree that it makes the idea of NFTs less \u201cscarce\u201d than you\u2019d like to assume.",

Having one made by Dorsey would theoretically make it more valuable, unless Dorsey decided to just make more.\n\nThis is a silly use of NFTs, probably done for charity since people actually think these might have value someday and why not take advantage of that?",

Pretty insane to see the functions of copyright, licensing, sale & distribution all in one simple little smart contract automatically governing the copyright and its uses.. this is part of the reason I think NFTs are going to flip content monetization on its head.. imagine a music copyright.. now anytime anyone wants to access the copyright it goes across network, knocks on the metaphorical door of the smart contract governing that work and then tells it its different prices for different desired uses.. say in a film, or commercial or maybe just some bar that wants to have that song in heavy rotation.. immediately the copyright is more valuable because it has full visibility into any and all streams/downloads/videos that HAD TO access the smart contract tracks which govern the work.. not to mention complete control of all terms of the contract such as price per play, price per film play, price to drag it into your YouTube or TikTok video real quick.. owners and those who hold smart contracts to distribute the work will almost instantaneously become more valuable than they currently are because funds for their work(s) are being managed with an all seeing eye (the network) and with terms and actual operations carried out by the smart contract from all over the world, IN REAL TIME, and all who want to use said work have to come knock on THE SAME DOOR\ud83d\udeaa\ud83e\udd2fLet\u2019s talk about immensely increasing the value of content creators and artists of all kinds, everywhere\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc (also peep why everyone in music industry copyright.. i.e. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, MLC as well as content streaming leaders like Spotify & TikTok are all millions of dollars invested in blockchain companies and projects at the moment)",
