The lucky winner will be able to enjoy pizza all year round! He or she will receive the equivalent of $2,000 in BNB. This amount should be enough to order a pizza 3 times a week for 365 days!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://cryptospection.com/binance-is-holding-a-contest-to-celebrate-bitcoin-pizza-day-win-pizza-all-year-long/](https://cryptospection.com/binance-is-holding-a-contest-to-celebrate-bitcoin-pizza-day-win-pizza-all-year-long/)",
