Even if you are dealing with gold and physical cash \n\n>Not planning any illegal activities or depositing millions of dollars, just trying to completely understand how things work.\n\nIf you are merely concerned about longterm privacy than you are likely overthinking things and the solution is rather simple. \n\n1)\tWithdraw your btc from exchange to wallet A(mobile wallet) , than send to wallet  wallet B(example - HW wallet) within a few hours and never in reverse you create more plausible deniability which is good for privacy and tax reasons. Make sure you send the entire amount each time as well. \n\n2)\tWhen you are ready to spend your bitcoin in your hardware wallet there are many ways to sell or spend the bitcoin very privately like loading the bitcoin up in a lightning wallet where chain analysis cannot track those UTXOs offchain. \n\nWith Chainanalytics exchanges and regulators are using probabilistic guess work in tracking transactions onchain. They merely assume your withdraw address likely belongs to you. By sending the bitcoin from wallet A to wallet B within a few hours you are creating plausible deniability and adding in significant doubt those UTXOs(bitcoin) belong to you and doing so in such a small window that the price change is moot to avoid creating a taxable event. At any time in the future you can privately spend the bitcoin or sell it for fiat in a private manner. \n\n>you need to link a bank account so your bank also has everything. \n\nYour bank knows how much fiat was deposited and withdrawn . That is it. not what you bought or if you bought any bitcoin or when you withdrew it or for how much \n\n>Haven\u2019t tried one yet but using an ATM is mentioned a lot.

                                    "response": ">I believe the exchanges send you a 1099?\n\nEvery exchange is different. For example coinbase uses a 1099MISC where they will not send anything to the IRS by default unless you have made over 600 dollars in interest (staking shitcoin ponzi's) and thus its more self reporting unless they need to report you for the FINCEN provision where any tx over 10k usd in value or structuring is reported \n\nIn the year 2024 exchanges in the USA will likely start reporting 1099B forms under the American infrastructure bill where people or businesses accepting txs over 10k in value will be reported directly to the IRS instead of indirectly with FINCEN , but that is a long way off and things might change closer to that date \n\n>Once that occurs it\u2019s pretty much over with. Everybody knows. What you do with it from then on doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nThis statement is wrong in multiple ways. Who \"knows\" is the exchange, and perhaps a department in the government. Not \"everyone\" \n\nAdditionally, If the a tax department knows you bought bitcoin they don't know much else. They don't know how much you sold/spent it for or if you lost it , or if it was stolen , or who you spent it with in many cases. \n\nOf course if you are a complete idiot , and bought bitcoin from a regulated exchange with your ID , withdrew bitcoin to wallet A , than sent bitcoin back to that same exchange that you bought it from with a tx over 10k usd , than yes , you have almost no privacy(with the exchange and FINCEN/IRS) and the tax authorities will know that those are your bitcoin and you are responsible for those taxes. \n\nBut you are not an idiot , so won't do this , right ?",
