The bank reiterated its February valuation of Bitcoin on Thursday\n\nIn a report to clients, Morgan Stanley said digital assets and cryptoassets replaced real estate as the bank's preferred alternative asset class alongside hedge funds. Because the sell-off hurt crypto assets more than other alternative assets such as private equity, private debt, and real estate, this suggests that crypto assets have more room to bounce back, while the other three alternative assets may present potential lagged repricing risks. JPMorgan adjusted its overall rating on alternative investments from overweight to underweight.",
