Looking ahead, we expect bitcoin as well as the crypto market to trend higher.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPreviously, JPMorgan had written in a report in February that Bitcoin had a fair price of $38,000, when the Bitcoin market price was around $43,000.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJPMorgan also wrote in Wednesday's report that cryptocurrencies have surpassed real estate and hedge funds as the bank's preferred \"alternative assets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs of writing, the total market value of the cryptocurrency market has fallen to $1.26 trillion, and bitcoin has fallen more than 30 percent over the year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTranslated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](https://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version)",
