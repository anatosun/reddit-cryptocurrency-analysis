What you do with your Trezor is generate a wallet with its own private/public key, and when you send your btc to that wallet what you do is \"link\" your btc to that key, so in the blockchain it's clear who is the owner of what. Trezor is a device to sign those transactions in a secure way. If you lose it you can buy another hardwallet, input your seed inside and generate the same keys so you can access your funds again, which are on the blockchain. You don't \"phisically\" have yout bitcoin in your trezor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen you have your coins in an exchange you can't see the seed (24 words) or your \"exchange wallet\". This is because when you buy Bitcoin in an exchange they show how much bitcoin you have in the exchange, but you can't be sure they bought that and saved it for you. Once you take them out of the exchange and send them into your hard wallet, you \"force\" the exchange to buy bitcoin or give you \"the real\" bitcoin, not just some numbers on your screen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThats the reason why people that want to hold long term need to take Bitcoin out of the exchange, so they can be sure they really have what they payed for.",

The blue wallet has a great UI but their security was really lacking compared to sparrow.**\n\nMy reservation with sparrow/cold card is:\n\n1. I don't like how my BTC balance is displayed on the sparrow desktop app. If someone steals my computer and gains access they can see my btc balance and could do a $5 wrench attack to access my cold card.\n2. I have not practiced for worst case scenario (cold card is lost/destroyed) and I have to use seed phrase to re-access all my coins.\n3.

I know these are small quantities, but I want to dip my toe in before I go fully in.\n\nMy fear is that I will regret not purchasing a large amount whenever we start moving out of the dip. But my bigger question is why are people so against buying through Venmo?\n\nThis is what I've read so far from other posts (a lot of these don't elaborate on the why):\n\n\"Venmo bitcoins are fake bitcoins\" \nHow so?\n\n\"You don't really own bitcoins\"\nWhy not?\n\n\"It's not secure because they focus on other cryptocurrencies as well\"\nThis kinda makes sense as I could see them working on different crypto securities and stretching themselves thin. What would be an example of it not being secure? Will a hacker go in and take the coins?\n\nI've been using Venmo for a while and I'd say I trust Venmo to some degree. I've never used Coinbase or any other platform so I'm a little sketched out by them. How secure are they?",

Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. \n\nBitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. \n\n\nThere are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties\n\nYou are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft \n\nYou are exposed to exit theft \n\nYou are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit\n\nYou place Bitcoin as a whole under more systemic risk by tempting exchanges to use fractional reserve banking and giving them too much influence\n\nYou potentially reduce the probability that your investment will appreciate in value because no exchanges are doing provable audits and they might be fractional. The more Bitcoin you personally control the more likely it will appreciate in value.\n\n**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet, custodian , or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**",

Other exchanges that actually give you real bitcoin offers more value purely from the additional utility. If you had millions in BTC (that you actually owned) you could borrow fiat against it for purchases without using your actual investment which in theory should continue to increase in value essentially making the fiat you borrowed \u201ccheaper\u201d. \n\nThere\u2019s risk involved with that if BTC crashes and the opposite happens where you have to put more capital down to avoid losing the BTC you took a loan against.\n\nIf you only plan to purchase small amounts with the goal to sell in the near future then there\u2019s not really any issue with Venmo. They are in control of what they do with the theoretical BTC though. What are you going to do if you go to sell and they won\u2019t give you money back? What if it skyrockets and your few dollars turns into $20k but when you go to sell venmo says \u201cwut BTC? You have no BTC\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that would happen honestly but it has happened before on many custodial exchanges over the years. Whether it\u2019s a delay on payout from that exchange after selling, them removing the ability to sell when price is jumping, or just taking your coins altogether and disappearing. \n\nThere\u2019s just unnecessary risk that comes with not owning your own coins. Putting your faith in corporate overlords tends to play out unfavorably.\n\nAlternatively if you\u2019re horrified that you will lose all your BTC in some scam, lose coins altogether by inadvertently sending them to wrong/non-existent address, etc. then Venmo is probably the right path\u2026although we\u2019d all strongly advise you do some digging into the resources in the side bar of this sub bc it\u2019s simple once you learn the basics. It\u2019s liberating once you truly control your own assets- for better or for worse.",
