In short, I have BTC spread amongst various exchanges because I was new to crypto and enjoyed the minor interest gains from these programs but now I fully realize the risk of \"lending\" my coins to these companies and with the current market, who knows if all of them will survive.\n\nI bought a cold card and was investigating moving the btc off the exchanges and into a sparrow/cold card set up. I have been playing around with it, but don't feel fully comfortable with the sparrow/cold card system to move all my BTC to this platform yet.\n\n**Any suggestions to either: rapidly learn about sparrow/cold card (I have already read both FAQ/DOCS pages on their respective websites) and watched a few YouTube videos? OR**\n\n**Any suggestions for an alternative, safe, and possibly easier to comprehend storage system? The blue wallet has a great UI but their security was really lacking compared to sparrow.**\n\nMy reservation with sparrow/cold card is:\n\n1. I don't like how my BTC balance is displayed on the sparrow desktop app. If someone steals my computer and gains access they can see my btc balance and could do a $5 wrench attack to access my cold card.\n2. I have not practiced for worst case scenario (cold card is lost/destroyed) and I have to use seed phrase to re-access all my coins.\n3. I am not running a BTC node so sparrow is using public servers for my wallet.",

Not by a lot, but just a couple cents. \n\nNow it's down again and I've been seeing that it's a great idea to purchase more now that there's a dip. I purchased an additional $20 today. I know these are small quantities, but I want to dip my toe in before I go fully in.\n\nMy fear is that I will regret not purchasing a large amount whenever we start moving out of the dip. But my bigger question is why are people so against buying through Venmo?\n\nThis is what I've read so far from other posts (a lot of these don't elaborate on the why):\n\n\"Venmo bitcoins are fake bitcoins\" \nHow so?\n\n\"You don't really own bitcoins\"\nWhy not?\n\n\"It's not secure because they focus on other cryptocurrencies as well\"\nThis kinda makes sense as I could see them working on different crypto securities and stretching themselves thin. What would be an example of it not being secure? Will a hacker go in and take the coins?\n\nI've been using Venmo for a while and I'd say I trust Venmo to some degree. I've never used Coinbase or any other platform so I'm a little sketched out by them. How secure are they?",

Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. \n\n\nThere are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties\n\nYou are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft \n\nYou are exposed to exit theft \n\nYou are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit\n\nYou place Bitcoin as a whole under more systemic risk by tempting exchanges to use fractional reserve banking and giving them too much influence\n\nYou potentially reduce the probability that your investment will appreciate in value because no exchanges are doing provable audits and they might be fractional. The more Bitcoin you personally control the more likely it will appreciate in value.\n\n**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet, custodian , or exchange .
