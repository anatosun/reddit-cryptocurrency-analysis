            "selftext": "  \n\nHello. I verified my account and started using Coinbase in 2020. I made very few transactions with very small amounts. My Coinbase account was already verified, but just a few months later Coinbase asked me to verify my identity again: uploading a selfie and driver's license photo. I did, I followed the instructions correctly. According to Coinbase, this process takes a couple of days, but it's been almost two years now and my account is still in \u201cverification process\u201d.\n\nI feel extremely powerless because my money is being held by Coinbase and I can't trade with it. In addition, Coinbase later asked me to answer some \u201cverification questions\u201d in which they asked me if I was related to another person with a name similar to mine, apparently related to politics. But obviously I am not that person and I have no relationship with politics. I am just a normal user of Coinbase.\n\nI already contacted the support team but my case was closed without resolution. To me, it is clear that there has been some kind of mistake. Please, I would like to resolve this incident as soon as possible. Thank you",
