So if you deposit $1,000 and you have a 1,000 dollar btc on the exchange it should let you use your funds immediately.  I've had issues with CB not taking the ACH from my account because of a glitch on their end which caused everything on the account to be locked down for 5 days (even though I had crypto on the account to cover).  That and the fact they limit me to $250 a day (I have CB debit card and send majority of my paycheck) makes it too inconvenient.  I now send to Gemini where I purchase USDC and send to CB.  Once it hits CB it's immediately available.",
