Exchanges are never without kyc but still there are some not so comfortable ways to buy btc without kyc. But first of all read more. In general your idea and motivation is right on point.

If I only receive money on them do the ledger corporation somehow store information about me?\"**\n\n\\-Possibly, most likely only if you don't use their software!  You have better chance using electrum and similar alternative  .\n\n**Also do anyone know if there is somehow a way to buy and store bitcoin anonymously?**\n\nBisq.   You could verify robosats too (Without kyc, but *potentially* not anonymous) .\n\n**Since we are moving into a cashless society and anonymity if disappearing and crypto could be our future. Is there a way to have anonymous accounts or do all the exchanges require ID and name etc?**\n\nBitcoin is digital p2p money and doesn't require any approval, It is \"pseudonymous\",  Firms do what they want. In my opinion it would be economically unviable and most likely promote new competition.\n\n**If no is there any way to make anonymous transactions at all?**\n\nTo Master your pseudonymous activity. You'll have to teach yourself bitcoin . You should read Mastering bitcoin *by Andreas M.Antonopoulos .*   *Everything* is on the bitcoin blockchain which is pretty big !\n\nWithout research.  You can also look into different protocols, the Liquid network, Lightning network and Taproot.",
