Just this morning when I tried to re-login on Binance (desktop pc), I clicked on the \"Get code\" under the Phone Number Verification Code, I received an SMS from an unknown number with the message \"Your -- is ######\". I did not use the \"verification code\" since it did not come from the usual Binance SMS sender with the message \"[Binance] Your login verification code is ######. Beware of scam ...\". I tried it several times and I received the same SMS from unknown mobile numbers, but I did not enter any of the verification codes sent to me. Is my Binance account already compromised?",
