It\u2019s often binary in this way. \n\nThe right thing to do is carve out 5 or 10% of your portfolio for crypto. This way, you risk losing 5% to 10% at most, overall. But you also expose yourself to making 100x your money. That\u2019s a very good asymmetry because you can put all your money into stocks and lose 10%, while exposing yourself to making 10%. Crypto, in this way, seems safer than stocks, since there is more inefficiency in crypto markets, meaning there is a better chance of making money.",

I guess we all have different plans and approaches, but there are things to do.\n\nSome NFTs are still surging and can continue to do so. Take a look at what's happening with the NBA Top Shots and projects like [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com), I think they won't be affected much. But even if the price drop, I won't miss this chance to grab one or two Substrapunks NFTs from [Unique Network](https://unique.network/). Those are the first NFTs on Polkadot and it's yet to become big.\n\nStaking can also be one way to go when everything is bleeding. With decent and sustainable yields I can make this journey less stressful until the market recovers. I'm focused on staking stablecoins, mostly USDC on [YieldApp](https://www.yield.app/) because I can get 18% APY if I try a bit more. [Celsius](https://celsius.network/) can be another way to \"unbank\" yourself even if their returns are a bit lower. We should not be greedy, that is my point of view.",
