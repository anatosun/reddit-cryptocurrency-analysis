            "text": "On Friday, Russia\u2019s ministry of finance submitted a finalized bill on the regulation of cryptocurrencies in Russia.\n\nAccording to a report by Kommersant, the bill that is titled \u201cOn Digital Currency\u201d contains a detailed regulatory framework on the circulation of cryptocurrencies and for the first time, \u201ctouches upon mining in detail,\u201d opening up new opportunities for Bitcoin miners who currently fall in the regulatory grey zone.\n\nAside from providing the legal framework for the circulation and issuance of cryptocurrencies, the draft bill also introduces requirements for certification, identification, and accounting for entities who would like to open digital asset businesses in Russia.\n\nMost notably, the draft law says that digital currency can be accepted \u201cas a means of payment that is not the monetary unit of the Russian Federation\u201d. Further, the bill recognizes cryptocurrencies as legally accepted investment vehicles.\n\nAccording to Blockchain lawyer Mikhail Uspensky, rules such as the requirement to retain registers of owners of digital currencies and the mandatory certification of electronic wallets are \u201cextremely overstated\u201d but still a step towards mass adoption.\n\nNot only will it be bullish for major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ethereum, but it will make other \"fundamentally rich\" projects like chainlink (allows integration of off-chain data into smart contracts), plastiks (enables recycling companies to monetize their recycling data through NFTs), and fantom (one of the fastest decentralized blockchains), gain significantly in market capitalization.\n\nWith that, despite the Russian central bank\u2019s tough stance on cryptocurrencies, tides seem to be shifting under Putin\u2019s administration, especially with the ongoing sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine. Fast-tracking crypto regulations are thus seen as a step in the fitting direction for a country that controls the third-largest bitcoin mining hash rate globally!",

The latest figures place it at around 4.8% per year, although it has fluctuated between -3 and 12% in the last five years.\n\nWhile the official announcement highlights the importance of the milestone, it is skimpy on details.\n\nAFP, which is like the Associated Press of the francophone world, translated the words of presidential chief of staff Obed Namsio: \"This step puts the Central African Republic on the map of the most daring and visionary countries in the world.\"\n\nIt joins El Salvador in the group of nations adopting Bitcoin. In June 2021, President Nayib Bukele promoted a monetary reform by which the BTC became legal tender along with the US dollar in the Central American country. The transition went into effect in September, with the help of its Bitcoin wallet partner, Strike.\n\nSince then, Bukele has made plans to harness El Salvador's geothermal energy to mine Bitcoin, as well as to sell Bitcoin-backed bonds, the latter of which has been put on hold due to lack of interest or the macroeconomic situation, according to the source.\n\nLess is known about the RCA's plans for [cryptocurrency development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development), or the government's ability to turn the project into reality. The Central African Republic, one of the poorest countries in the world, is heavily dependent on diamond exports, agriculture and foreign aid. It is also politically unstable. A civil war in the early 2010s led to the dissolution of the government and a failed state. Touad\u00e9ra became president in 2016 following the creation of a new constitution.",

According to experts, the ETF will allow $1 billion in inflows when it launches in Australia. \n\nCosmos Asset Management's ETF comes with an interesting caveat.

With this,people could easily trade their Bitcoin and even copy trades from highly performing traders on Tycoon.io\n\nThe bill says \u201cBitcoin\u201d specifically rather than cryptocurrency in general, and doesn\u2019t mention any other digital currency besides the first and only P2P system that managed to trustlessly solve the double-spending problem of digital cash.",

In a similar vein to The Apprentice and Dragon's Den, brave entrepreneurs are seen pitching business ideas to experienced investors.\n\nWozniak said that Unicoin could serve as a gateway to the world of startup investing. \"A token is scarce by itself. It could even have zero value,\" Wozniak said. \"I hope that Unicoin will be very successful, but at least it is not based on zero, only on words and words. It is really based on the result of the investments.\"\n\nUnicoin is not Wozniak's only venture into the [development of cryptocurrency](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) space. In December 2020, Wozniak launched Efforce ( ticker WOZX ), a cryptocurrency that promised to be \"the first blockchain-based energy saving platform,\" according to his website.\n\nEfforce's premise is simple: every WOZX token holder is investing in tokenized energy savings. Companies report their energy savings, and these savings are written into the blockchain and redistributed between token holders and participating companies.\n\nDays after the Efforce filing, the token hit an all- time high of $3.66. Since then, however, WOZX price performance has been dismal, falling as low as $0.15 last month, a drop of more than 95% from high to low.\n\nWhether Unicoin will suffer a similar fate remains to be seen.",

Monero is without a doubt the best cryptocurrency on the market.

They could use ring signatures to improve encryption, but that won't solve the problem of transactions being de-obfuscated after the fact. Nothing prevents people from simply keeping a copy of the ledger in its current state.\n\nMonero may or may not be useful to each user, depending on their threat model and risk tolerance. That's on top of the possibility of it being regulated out of existence and losing value as a result. Let's hope that's not the case.\n\n\n\nDo you have a different viewpoint?

It will be plain old Web2 in the first case.\n\nIn a recent interview with Wired, Gavin Wood brought this up - \"We need to know more about the [blockchcain] network's node infrastructure: is it truly peer-to-peer, or is it controlled from a single data centre by a company that manufactures and sells hardware and must be consulted before a new node can be added? The details determine whether it's merely a Web 2.0 clone or a legitimately open, transparent, decentralised, peer-to-peer system.\"\n\nSimply because Web3 platforms are receiving massive funding, in the billions of dollars, from various investors around the world, these investors will undoubtedly be at their helm as these platforms mature into mainstream use. These platforms will then become the internet behemoths they were designed to replace, albeit in a new era.\n\n\n\nIf you want to know where the next big ideas will come from, look where the money and smart developers are going, has always been a truism in Silicon Valley. In the case of Web3, there has been no scarcity of funds. Only a few developers, however, have decided to join this particular bandwagon.\n\nMany well-known developers, such as the creators of the homebrew tool, have created tea, a web 3 tool.\n\nThere are several other challenges that Web3 is currently facing, such as making it more accessible to the general public and lowering the cost of developing a platform on it. Its role in the future will be defined by how its stakeholders address these issues.

            "text": "Since cryptocurrencies are decentralized and not under the control of financial institutions, they need a way to verify transactions. One method many cryptos use is proof of stake (PoS).\n\nProof of stake is a type of consensus mechanism used to validate cryptocurrency transactions. With this system, owners of the cryptocurrency can stake their coins, which gives them the right to check new blocks of transactions and add them to the blockchain.\n\nThis method is an alternative to proof of work, the first consensus mechanism developed for cryptocurrencies. Since proof of stake is much more energy-efficient, it has gotten more popular as attention has turned to how crypto mining affects the planet.\n\nProof of work was the method of choice for early cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, while proof of stake originated in 2012 with Peercoin and has become a common choice for altcoins.\n\nThe biggest difference between proof of stake and proof of work is their energy usage. Proof of work requires miners to compete to solve complex mathematical problems. The first miner to solve the problem gets to add a block of transactions and earn rewards. This results in mining devices around the world computing the same problems and using substantial energy.\n\nSince proof of stake doesn't require validators to all solve complex equations, it's a much more eco-friendly way to verify transactions.\n\nSome examples of cryptocurrencies that use proof of stake are Cardano, a research-driven blockchain that prioritizes security and sustainability; Tezos, a programmable blockchain designed with an on-chain upgrade mechanism for adaptability; Nature's Vault, a blockchain that unlocks the value of in-ground mineral assets without environmental consequences; and Algorand a two-tier blockchain structure to offer processing speeds of 1,000 transactions per second!\n\nBecause of how it works, proof of stake benefits both the cryptocurrencies that use it and their investors. Cryptocurrencies that use proof of stake are able to process transactions quickly and at a low cost, which is key for scalability. Investors can stake their crypto to earn rewards, providing a form of passive income. And the fact that proof of stake is environmentally friendly means it will likely continue to grow more popular as a consensus mechanism. ETH's plans to shift to PoS is a testament to this.",

            "text": "Here are some travel tips from a couple who traveled around El Salvador for 45 days using only Bitcoin.\n\nEl Salvador adopted Bitcoin ( BTC ) as legal tender more than four months ago, on September 7, 2021. Bitcoiners around the world have been watching closely as El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele attempts to \"convert\" to an entire nation.\n\nThe president regularly buys every drop, has promised a low-tax Bitcoin \u201ccitadel\u201d in the form of Bitcoin City , and is exploring mining BTC with renewable energy using volcanoes.\n\nBut, what is the day-to-day life of those who live in the smallest country in Central America, known as \"the land of volcanoes\"? Moreover, what is it like to try to live only on Bitcoin?\n\nAn Italian couple, Rikki and Laura, have succeeded. Rikki is a Bitcoin podcaster and human rights activist, active in the space since 2016. Laura works as a community manager in the blockchain space and has been focused on crypto since 2019.\n\nAfter the approval of the Bitcoin Law, Laura had the idea of \u200b\u200btraveling throughout El Salvador for 45 days. The challenge? Live only with Bitcoin. No bartering, no euros, and of course no US dollars.\n\nTheir experiences offer a fascinating insight into the country's history, its enchanting landscapes, and, of course, its future with Bitcoin. His travel accounts can be read in English and Italian, and his podcast is called *Bitcoin Italy Podcast* .\n\nOn the other hand, Rikki and Laura have also encountered significant challenges from just using BTC, such as gaps in education and difficulties transacting with Bitcoin. On January 24, they spoke with Cointelegraph via video call from Santa Ana, a coffee-rich region of El Salvador.\n\nThey are now authentic sources of knowledge for bitcoiners who want to try a BTC-only trip to El Salvador. Here are his top tips for crypto enthusiasts traveling to the small tropical nation.\n\n**Do you accept Bitcoin? No? Bye!**\n\nIn San Salvador, many places accept Bitcoin, from McDonald's to Starbucks to mom-and-pop stores. In El Zonte, known as \"Bitcoin Beach\", the birthplace of the Bitcoin Law, most vendors advertise that they accept BTC. However, off the beaten track, Bitcoin is little known and is sometimes confused with the state-sponsored wallet, Chivo Wallet .\n\nWhen faced with a seller who does not accept Bitcoin, the pair's main advice is to conduct a theatrical experiment. The customer must ask the seller if they accept Bitcoin, and if the seller says no, the customer must turn on their heel and walk away. They should not take the money.\n\nAs Rikki explained, \"you just have to go!\" Traders want the business, so if a customer makes a scene showing they only have Bitcoin, the seller will want to accept their sats.\n\nIf a seller doesn't want to accept Bitcoin, it's usually not due to infrastructure shortfalls, since \"you can buy a cheap Chinese smartphone on the market with a sim card and a data plan for $20, and the connection here is huge.\" It is the \"perfect country to carry out the Bitcoin experiment\".\n\nThis brings us to the interesting part, which is getting to the \u201cwhy\u201d, the reason behind not accepting Bitcoin. Sometimes it is simply because the owner of the restaurant or hotel has confused Chivo with Bitcoin, it is more common than you think. Other times, a quick chat and a few taps on Chivo are enough for them to see how it works.\n\nRikki and Laura had a blast discussing and educating the locals about Bitcoin, making great memories along the way.\n\n**Prepare and re-prepare**\n\nAlthough the adventure was a lot of fun, Rikki said, \"It's not easy, and it takes a bit of preparation. You have to plan your routes in advance. Especially when you get away from the main tourist areas, where bitcoin is less accepted.\" In some cases, the couple called 20 or 30 hotels before finding a bitcoiner.\n\nUndeterred by the challenge, these fights were, in his opinion, the cream in the pot of his traveling adventure. \"Sometimes we ended up in the craziest places just because we were looking for places that accept Bitcoin.\" They joke that Satoshi Nakamoto was the driving force behind his daily decision making.\n\nTraveling solo with Bitcoin also meant that the pair were forced to engage with the locals on a more intimate level, making human connections along the way.\n\n**Sorry Satoshi, but museums don't accept Bitcoin**\n\nRikki really wanted to see the Mayan ruins of Tazumal, a historical site and archaeological museum near Santa Ana. However, the heritage sites only accept cash. Rikki was crestfallen and, given the opportunity, would question President Bukele about such a strange omission of Bitcoin. \"Why are the museums managed by the Salvadoran Ministry of Culture only cash?\".\n\nThe decision may change as the Bitcoin Law slowly rolls out to affect all walks of society, but currently, cultural experiences, museums and some excursions are cash only. The couple couldn't get into those sites due to their strict rules. Bitcoin farmers should carry a few bucks just in case.\n\n**Education, education, education**\n\nFew Salvadorans understand what Bitcoin is, how it works, or the difference between Lightning Network and on-chain transactions. As Laura points out, some Salvadorans \"think that you can only pay in Bitcoin if you use the Chivo app.\" They are unaware of other Lightning wallets like BlueWallet or Wallet of Satoshi.\n\nIn the Chivo app itself, there are no teaching tools for users who want to learn about Bitcoin. Rikki explained that \"nobody here knows anything about Bitcoin. They didn't provide a second of education to the people of El Salvador.\" Laura added: \"If people had learned about Bitcoin, they wouldn't be using the app.\"\n\nGiven the lack of information and education of Salvadorans, it is therefore the responsibility of Bitcoiner tourists to take their time with the locals. They must share their knowledge about Bitcoin and be patient while Salvadorans begin to understand the monetary network.\n\nAs Michael Saylor often says , it takes thousands of hours to understand Bitcoin. The Bitcoin Law was quickly passed and implemented, and many locals have not had the time to understand the technology.\n\n**\"Come to El Salvador and spend your Bitcoin here\"**\n\nThis is not so much advice as a plea from Rikki and Laura on behalf of the Bitcoin community in El Salvador.\n\nCome to El Salvador, and spend your Bitcoin. This increases awareness, broadens education levels through network effects and word of mouth, and ultimately encourages more and more people to use the Bitcoin network, they said.\n\nFor Rikki, \"the more you trade, the more you learn. The more you learn, the more you study, and use it for good.\"\n\nFor cryptocurrency development contact us\n\n[https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development)",

            "text": "*Replace-by-fee*, also known as RBF, is a substitution of one transaction for another on the Bitcoin network. This can be done by offering a higher fee for miners, which translates into faster confirmation of the operation. The default enablement of this tool in wallets has grown considerably during 2021.\n\nAccording to statistics published by Bitcoinops, **the RBF option has been activated much more in the last year compared to previous years**. As of January 1, 2021, 14% of the transactions of an average of 144 blocks were signaling the RBF. As can be seen in the graph below, this percentage has increased during the year, and almost doubled. More precisely, it reached 27.5% in November.\n\nIf the larger scenario is observed, for example **taking the last 5 years, the increase is even more pronounced**. In 2017, RBF transactions represented less than 0.2%, a percentage that only started to rise at the beginning of 2018, as can be seen in the following graph.\n\n## What does the increased use of RBF imply?\n\n*Replace-by-fee* is a good way out for those situations in which the commissions of the Bitcoin network go up. In these circumstances, transactions on the Mempool that were sent with low commissions lag behind. If you have the urgency to confirm them, you can resort to this alternative.\n\nIncreasing RBF-enabled transactions can have two connotations. First, there are **more wallets that allow users to perform this substitution of a transaction**.\n\nOn the other hand, it can also be understood that **the technical knowledge of the people who use these wallets has increased**. While a few years ago it would have been unlikely that the RBF resource would become massive, today users know more about the functionalities of wallets and take advantage of them when operating.\n\nOn average, a quarter of the operations of the 144 blocks analyzed resorted to a commission replacement or RBF.\n\n## Replace-by-fee, a method with \"little usability\"\n\nThe complexity of using the RBF method is something that the developers of the bitcoin ecosystem have highlighted in the past. For example, Dar\u00edo Sneidermanis, CEO of Muun Wallet, had explained to CriptoNoticias that \"RBF ( *Replace-By-Fee* ) has a thousand cases in which it does not work, very difficult for the user to predict.\"\n\nAccording to his company's research, the usability level of this feature \"is pretty dire,\" Sneidermanis said. On the reasons for this low adoption, he stated that \"to be fair, this is mostly caused by the complexity of the RBF rules.\"\n\nHowever, as the statistics show, the figure is increasing and the RBF is enabled in more and more wallets. For example, **Electrum is one of those that added this feature during 2021**, as reported by CryptoNews in April.\n\nFor cryptocurrency development contact us\n\n[https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development)",

Investor safety is inadequate, and investments in digital currency can be lost as a result of market fluctuation, fraud, and cyberthreats, according to the CBR.\n\nThe revelation comes after the central bank proposed a ban on most crypto operations in January. Other government entities reacted angrily to its tough proposition. The CBR proposed legislation limiting the use of cryptocurrency in February. However, it is unlikely to gain traction because a rising number of authorities in Moscow regard crypto assets as a way to get through Western sanctions imposed in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \n\nWith the exception of bitcoin payments, the Ministry of Finance has been leading efforts to legitimize cryptocurrency operations, and it just resubmitted its new bill \"On Digital Currency\" to the federal government, which supports its approach. Crypto mining is presently regulated under clauses in the proposed law. In the meantime, the Bank of Russia has signaled that it may approve the legalization of the industry.\n\nAccording to certain estimates, the number of crypto transactions done on cryptos like BTC, ETH, ALT, $Darc et cetera by Russian residents topped $5 billion last year, according to the central bank. The regulator has admitted that Russians have been actively trading on digital asset exchanges and that their country is among the world's leaders in terms of digital coin-mining capability.",

            "text": " Crypto assets will benefit more from inflation than other assets.\n\n* However, some economists expect inflation to cool down in 2022.\n* Rising rates is not good for risky assets in general, and this can include [cryptocurrencies development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) as well.\n* Declining bond yields may make crypto assets more attractive in the long run next year.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has had one of its best years on record, and the global macroeconomic environment largely has that to thank. With rising inflation and historically low interest rates, those of us lucky enough to have savings have looked for somewhere more profitable than a bank account to store them.\n\nAt the same time, institutional investors have also been swayed by the same basic motivations to convert parts of their portfolios to crypto assets, another big reason we saw numerous all-time highs throughout 2021. By 2022, however, economists and analysts say we could see inflationary fears recede as the world economy stabilizes.\n\nAnalysts also expect to see interest rates rise sometime next year, a factor that may depress - at least to some extent - investors' appetite for more speculative assets like bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets. However, some analysts estimate that the rate hikes will not be very large, and that the general appetite for cryptocurrencies could be slightly affected.\n\nConcerns about inflation may disappear sooner or later. Annual consumer price inflation reached 6.2% in October in the United States, the highest rate in 30 years. Coupled with the fact that the Federal Reserve interest rate is effectively 0%, this means that people in the United States - as we see elsewhere as well - are effectively being subjected to negative interest rates.\n\nTherefore, dollars (and euros, pounds, etc.) have been losing their purchasing power, so anyone with extra money on hand has sought to turn it into something that retains its value more. This is basically what analysts speaking to Cryptonews.com predicted last year for 2021, and it explains much of the heat we've seen in the crypto markets this year.\n\n*\"I see that inflationary pressures will continue in 2022. The effects of pandemic policies, fiscal largesse through stimulus checks and a tremendously expansionary monetary policy are at work; the genie is not so easy to put back in the bottle,\" he said. Pete Earle, an economist at the American Institute for Economic Research.*\n\nEarle suggests that crypto assets will benefit more from inflation than other assets, if only because they are easier for the public to access. That said, some economists expect inflation to cool down in 2022.\n\n\"I don't think the economic recovery is strong enough that price pressures continue to rise in 2022,\" said Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst at ThinkMarkets.\n\nFor Razaqzada, one of the main drivers of the decline in inflation will be oil prices, which are often correlated with macroeconomic cycles.\n\n\"I believe that oil prices will fall again as supply increases both from the OPEC + group and from other producers, including the United States. The possible return of the supply of Iranian oil could further weigh down crude prices ,\" he told Cryptonews.com.\n\nMeanwhile, the impact of temporary factors and supply problems that have raised prices (as the world emerges from the coronavirus pandemic) is likely to diminish as well, Razaqzada adds.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone also suspects inflation will ease soon.\n\n*\" Dying gold and declining US Treasury yields are leading indicators that the 2021 rebound in inflation is a blink within the prevailing deflationary trends, especially given the rapid advance of technology, \"he told Cryptonews.com.*\n\nAlthough few analysts estimate that inflation will be seriously negative next year, some say that we could continue to see a mixed picture, with contradictory forces affecting the overall outlook.\n\n\"On the one hand, we have the global supply chain problems that cause prices to rise and tight employment conditions that cause wage increases. On the other hand, we have the long-term disinflationary impact of technological improvements \\[.. .\\] and then there is the demographic impact of an aging population, which will also depress prices, \"said Glen Goodman, author of The Crypto Trader.\n\nDespite acknowledging that things will be mixed, Goodman tells Cryptonews.com that he remains \"very concerned\" about inflation in the coming years, and in particular that central banks are \"not addressing it effectively.\"\n\nHowever, even if inflation doesn't end up bad in 2022, some observers say bitcoin's status as a hedge will continue to cement next year.\n\n*\"I see crypto assets, especially Bitcoin, less as a hedge of inflation now, but on the way to getting there. Bitcoin is in the price discovery phase to achieve global digital collateral status in a world that is goes digital, \"said Mike McGlone.*\n\nWill interest rates rise again? Fawad Razaqzada points out that if we assume that at least part of the reason behind the rally in cryptocurrencies in 2021 has been inflation hedging, then this source of influence will no longer be there to support the prices in 2022. Likewise, it is possible that interest rates will rise in such a way that crypto assets are slightly less attractive.\n\n*\"If inflation turns out to be hotter and stickier than expected, surely the major central banks will have to tighten their belts more aggressively in 2022. Rising rates are not good for risky assets in general, and this may also include cryptocurrencies, \"Razaqzada said.*\n\nMike McGlone also expects interest rates to rise somewhat in 2022, although the effect on the crypto market may again be mixed.\n\n\"Central banks will try to get rid of QE \\[quantitative easing\\] and low rates, until the stock market actually falters or falls around 10% and stays down for a while, and the prospects for reduction or tightening will go away, in my opinion. This is not deep, but has been the long-lasting trend, \"he said.\n\nAt the same time, McGlone suspects that a stock market crash - caused in part by a rate hike - could turn US bond yields negative.\n\n*\"This is good for bitcoin and ethereum , but extreme speculative excesses should be a headwind for the crypto market as a whole. Bitcoin is likely to go down initially, if the stock market does, but I see the three major crypto musketeers (bitcoin, ethereum and crypto dollars) will come out ahead, \"he explained.*\n\nIt's worth noting that the Bank of England defied expectations in early November and kept the UK base rate where it was at 0.1%. This was primarily due to fear of stifling the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and is a concern that we may see next year, with other central banks reluctant to raise rates too abruptly.\n\n\u201cI hope central banks will eventually raise interest rates, but it will probably be too little, too late. That situation can be positive for [cryptocurrencies developement](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development), as riskier assets tend to benefit from an inflationary environment of low interest rates, \u201dsaid Glen Goodman.\n\nOther Macroeconomic Factors Inflation and interest rates tend to be the two big macroeconomic indicators for the growth of the crypto market. However, there are some others, whose growth (or not) in employment and the economy in general is also worth watching.\n\n\u201cWhen the economy is doing well and employment is high, people and institutions are more likely to invest in financial markets, including crypto, than during an economic downturn. So these macro trends are worth watching in the months and years to come if you are a long-term buy-and-hold investor, \u201dsaid Fawad Razaqzada.\n\nMike McGlone also advises investors to keep an eye on the (US) stock market, while noting once again that declining bond yields may make crypto assets more attractive in the long run. next year.\n\nHe says: \u201cA wobble in the US stock market, and the potential for the stock market to start underperforming, should ultimately be bullish for bitcoin and, to a lesser extent, ethereum \\[.. .\\] I see primary potential macroeconomic development in 2022, US bond yields resume a long-lasting downtrend (nearly 40 years) and bitcoin remains above $ 100,000. \"",

            "text": "Since Bitcoin was adopted as legal tender in El Salvador, the country has been devising innovative ways to integrate it into the economy. So much so that plans to build a \"Bitcoin City\" have also recently been announced . In fact, the same will be financed through a 1 billion dollar \u201cBitcoin Bond\u201d with a 10-year maturity on Liquid Network.\n\nThe soon-to-be-issued Bitcoin bond, built by Blockstream and processed by Bitfinex, will offer investors an annual interest payment rate of 6.5% along with the dividends generated by the liquidation of Bitcoin holdings. Furthermore, the planned $ 1 billion will be split evenly between the allocation of BTC and the construction of energy and mining infrastructure in the region.\n\nIn a recent podcast , Bitcoin strategist Greg Foss shared his optimism about this move. In fact, he believes that the bond will be attractive to a variety of different investors. According to Foss, in addition to being a lucrative investment, the Bitcoin bond will help El Salvador \"put more financing options on the table for a country that until now has been held hostage by the IMF.\"\n\nEl Salvador's credit worthiness has taken a hit this year , due in part to its decision to legally adopt Bitcoin. However, Foss argued that if the Bitcoin bond is protected or not allowed to be settled before a stipulated time, \"Bitcoin City could have a much higher credit quality than El Salvador as a whole.\"\n\n#### El Salvador against the IMF\n\nAnother component of the bond that could be attractive to investors is its focus on Bitcoin mining.\n\n*\"There is a component that is sensitive to the price of Bitcoin, but in theory, the difficulty setting should allow miners to make money regardless of the price of Bitcoin.\"*\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin \"does its thing\" and rises higher, then the bond's appeal will multiply, Foss said.\n\n*\u201cThose bonds will trade on the open market at a rate much higher than six and a half percent. They will trade at a lower yield at a higher price because the six and a half will be extremely attractive, so people will raise the price of those bonds and, conversely, the yield will decrease. \"*\n\nIn addition to being attractive to investors, Foss also asserted that the bond will help increase El Salvador's financing flexibility beyond the reach of a \"restrictive\" IMF.\n\n*\"One of the things that is very restrictive about lending to a risky counterparty is that the lender makes sure that the borrower is a little limited in what they can do with the money.\"*\n\nA few days after El Salvador made the news of the Bitcoin bond public, the IMF issued a direct warning to the Central American nation citing \"significant risks to consumer protection, financial integrity and financial stability\" due to price volatility. of Bitcoin.\n\nHe also added that Bitcoin could increase the country's tax contingent liabilities, which are losses that could be incurred in the future due to the occurrence of specific events.\n\nFor cryptocurrency development contact us\n\n[https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development)",

            "text": "*Bitcoin in Spanish speaking is a weekly newsletter from CriptoNoticias in which we review the most important news related to bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchains in the Hispanic world.*\n\nAfter a week of much movement in El Salvador, bitcoin continues to be the protagonist in the Central American country. The government bought more bitcoins (BTC) despite criticism from international bodies.\n\nMeanwhile, in Colombia there are also criticisms against cryptocurrencies despite the fact that the local currency, the peso, looks weak. On the other hand, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) continue to dominate the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem in the region. In this case, from Argentina to Venezuela.\n\nDo you want to know more about current affairs in Hispanic countries? Next, we present the **weekly summary of CriptoNoticias with the most important events for bitcoin** , cryptocurrencies and blockchains among Spanish-speaking countries:\n\n## Argentina\n\nThe first news that we highlight this week **is about the Argentine Federal Blockchain** , which brings together companies and institutions from the South American country. In more than a month, this blockchain has not presented activity , which makes citizens question its usefulness. Although we published the news in this medium on November 22, at the time of writing this newsletter the situation has not changed.\n\nOn more positive notes, we have the news that Belo, one of the brokers that exist in Argentina, incorporated almost immediate transactions with bitcoins through the Lightning network to its platform .\n\nIn Argentina, the NFTs are gaining strength, both in the sports world and in the entertainment world. The national soccer team launched its second token collection this week. For their part, artists such as **Nikki Nicole and Babas\u00f3nicos will do the same with the Ripio exchange.**\n\n## Colombia\n\nIn Colombia, the situation of the local currency, the peso, is not the best. During the week, the price of the dollar increased and approached 4,000 pesos for the second time this year. In addition, with Colombians using more and more online payment channels, bitcoin could be presented as an alternative for Colombians to protect themselves from the devaluation of their currency.\n\nThe latter might not like the former presidential candidate **Gustavo Petro, who assured last Tuesday that cryptocurrency mining** was very harmful , due to its energy consumption.\n\n## The Savior\n\nAfter the closing of Bitcoin Week in El Salvador and the news that they could issue new Bitcoin-based bonds, the government of Nayib Bukele continues to speak for its management of resources and the purchase of BTC. Taking advantage of a new drop in the price of the main[ development of cryptocurrency](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) on the market, **the Salvadoran government added another 100 BTC to its coffers.**\n\nThe way in which Bukele has driven the adoption of cryptocurrency in his country has not been well received by everyone. In fact, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) again warned of the risks of Bitcoin. The Bank of England also joined the organizations that have shown their concern about what is happening in the Central American country.\n\n## Spain\n\nPeople don't wait for their respective governments to take steps like Bukele's. They use cryptocurrencies without the existence of a Bitcoin Law. In the case of Spain, a recent survey revealed that the majority are looking for profit or **the possibility of having assets that are not under state control.**\n\nAlso in the European country, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) remains concerned about the presence of advertising dedicated to cryptocurrency investment platforms that are being investigated for suspicious activities.\n\n## Mexico\n\n\"Buy bitcoin right now\" is the advice of Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego. The recommendation came just after criticizing the monetary policy of the United States, which has inflated the issuance of banknotes to levels never seen before, something that Salinas called \"irresponsible.\"\n\nAnd precisely, one of the most renowned soccer clubs in Mexico, Tigres UANL, allied with the Bitso exchange. In addition to being a sponsor of the Mexican soccer First Division team, Bitso and the club will explore **the integration of payments with bitcoin for tickets and** ***souvenirs*** **.** They could even pay players with cryptocurrencies.\n\n## Venezuela\n\nThe popularity of NFTs is evident among Venezuelans. According to the Finder firm, already at least a third of the population knows what these tokens are, which have gained a lot of ground as a source of income in this and other countries with economic difficulties.\n\nThe NFTs have even reached the Venezuelan government, which this week immortalized the Guinness Record obtained by the National System of Orchestras with a collectible token .\n\nThis week, in this newspaper we review the growth of Binance as an alternative for payments in shops in Venezuela. We also have the experience of **paying with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on the streets of Caracas.**\n\n## Events of the week\n\nAmong the events related to bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchains in the region for this week, the following stand out in the CriptoNoticias calendar:\n\n* Monday, November 29: \u00abDigital currencies\u00bb, organized by Web3 Latam.\n* Tuesday, November 30: \"Cycle of crypto webinars: Legales & NFT's (Cryptocurrencies and their tax aspects)\", event organized by BitcoinAR.\n* Wednesday December 1: \u00abNFT's\u00bb. Organized by web3 Latam.\n* Thursday, December 2: \"Introductory talk to Bitcoin and Blockchain\", by the NGO Bitcoin Argentina.\n* Friday, December 3: \u00abBlockchain x Social Impact\u00bb, by Web3 Latam.\n\n### Merchants that accept cryptocurrencies in Spanish-speaking countries\n\n* Piurer (online florist in Spain).\n* Global Motor\u2019s (vehicles and motorcycles in Argentina).\n* Remington Center (beauty products in Caracas, Venezuela).",

Blinken.\n\nDespite its recent success, the darknet marketplace's revenue streams have exploded in recent years as it has become the go-to location for Russian illegal money and cybercrime. Hydra's revenue in 2016 was less than $10 million; by 2020, it will be $1.3 billion. \nAccording to the Treasury, Hydra handled about 86 percent of the illicitly traded bitcoin in 2019 that passed via Russian cryptocurrency exchanges. \n\nThe darknet, in general, gives its users an extra degree of anonymity by using software that pings their machines' actual location all over the world. This makes it harder for law authorities to track down conspirators who use sites like Hydra to carry out illegal activities.\n\nIn addition to the sanctions, US authorities revealed the discovery of over 100 virtual currency addresses utilized in the site's activities and illegal transactions. \nThis can help authorities trace Hydra's conspirators, especially when they have to act in the real world, such as when they walk out to deliver unlawful products, such as drugs, to a planned drop-off point after an online transaction. \nOn Monday, the Treasury sanctioned Garantex, a virtual currency trading site based in Moscow that conducts the majority of its business. \nGarantex allows its users to purchase and sell virtual currencies with fiat currencies, which are money that is not backed by any physical asset such as gold or silver. According to American authorities, the site has processed over $100 million in transactions linked to illicit actors and darknet markets, including roughly $2.6 million from Hydra.\n\nGarantex's license to operate in Estonia was revoked two months ago after the country's Financial Intelligence Unit discovered that the site's clients were utilizing the virtual currency exchange for illicit purposes such as money laundering. \n\nDespite this, the Treasury claims that Garantex has continued to help and abet illegal activities from its current locations in Moscow and St. Petersburg.",

Till now, blockchain Interoperability has been one of the major challenges in the industry.  \nAn interoperability protocol in simple terms is like an adapter that takes bitcoin and allows it to function as an erc-20 token (wrapped asset). They just don't communicate because they are two different chains, so essentially, they are bridged between the two that allows them to communicate. And interoperability has grown in importance as a Web3 feature.  \nHigh transaction fees, security problems and low scalability are three of the major challenges of the Interoperability protocol. This is one of Axl Inu's most significant advantages.  \nThrough the Polygon network, Axl Inu fully supports multichain smart contract protocols. They currently support the Ethereum chain and the Binance smart chain, allowing users to easily interact and switch to a different one that may be faster or have lower transaction fees.  \nThe Launchpad is another point of emphasis. Yes, they have a launchpad that will aid in the introduction of new and innovative projects to the market by supporting, nurturing, and promoting trailblazing projects. They recently completed their first IDO and INO, and Gravis Finance (GRVS) was the project that launched there.  \nThe launchpad tier mechanism is designed to allow AXL and NFTB holders with a larger balance to benefit from additional benefits. Users who participate in fixed staking programs will be able to participate in Launchpad IDOs and INOs.  \nConfirm for yourself that AXL is not a classical INU project, like those rugs, it's vice versa !",

The law has been resubmitted to the government and could be passed at the spring session of parliament.\n\nA law aiming to set comprehensive rules for the Russian cryptocurrency sector has been modified by Russia's Ministry of Finance. The most recent version now incorporates other government institutions' opinions on the issue, according to the department's announcement on Friday. \n\nThe draft law \"On Digital Currency,\" which has been finalized, has been returned to Moscow's cabinet of ministers. The bill, which was first introduced to the Russian government in February, proposes to control crypto transactions as well as the activities of crypto market participants in the country. It was created to fill up the regulatory loopholes left after the passage of the \"Digital Financial Assets Act.\" \n\nThe new rule, together with revisions to the Russian Tax Code pertaining to cryptocurrency operations, is expected to be implemented during the State Duma's spring session, according to Anatoly Aksakov, chair of the Financial Market Committee in the lower house of Russian parliament.\n\nThe bill's rules on crypto mining regulation, for example, have been clarified, according to the Finance Ministry. While the usage of bitcoin in payments has been met with criticism, most notably from Russia's Central Bank and, more recently, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, many Russian politicians have embraced the concept of mining being recognized as a legitimate economic activity. \n\nThe Bank of Russia proposed a blanket ban on a variety of crypto-related activities, including mining, in January, but the Russian government agreed with Minfin that the industry should be regulated rather than limited. President Vladimir Putin urged them to work out their differences and highlighted Russia's mining potential.\n\nThe Ministry of Economic Development recommended in February to allow the extraction of digital currencies in areas where there is a surplus of electricity and to offer miners reasonable electricity rates. The Ministry of Energy called for the immediate legalization of bitcoin mining and the implementation of regional energy quotas for bitcoin farms in late March. The Ministry of Industry and Trade, as well as the Ministry of Construction, Housing, and Utilities, proposed an experimental legislative regime for mining this week.",

We are not there yet, until crypto is used to buy and sell real goods, and this is the final truth of it. \n\nCrypto, to most, is still a fictional entity that represents the internet and the fast moving world. It is still not that physical, tactile element that it should be, but this will not be the case for too long. \n\nThis could be seen from examples such as incorporated crypto within their card option, you could buy real things with crypto and get \u2018cryptoback\u2019 returns in place of cashback returns. \n\n\u201cCardholders will earn 1.5% cash back on all purchases that will automatically be converted to bitcoin and placed into a BlockFi account every month.

For example, Elon Musk announced in March 2021 that his Tesla car company would accept Bitcoin, the world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency, as payment, only to reverse the decision two months later. The change in plans was attributed to environmental concerns. Musk went on to say that Tesla would only accept Bitcoin again if the cryptocurrency became less harmful to the environment.\n\nStellar\nThe Stellar network was created as a result of a fork of the popular cryptocurrency Ripple. Stellar debuted in 2014 and is managed by the Stellar Development Foundation, a non-profit organisation. Stellar has a lower carbon footprint because the network token Lumens conducts trades for pennies on the dollar and with high efficiency.\n\nTron\nTron is a one-of-a-kind public blockchain and peer-to-peer (P2P) platform that allows users to directly share apps on its blockchain. Tron is one of the most profitable digital currencies for exchange trading.\n\nWhat is the source of its efficient?\nThe process of transferring apps on this P2P network consumes very little energy. TRON generates cryptocurrency through pre-mining, which is more environmentally friendly.\n\nBob Eco coin\nIt is also worthwhile to investigate some new projects, such as Bob Eco Coin. This is a relatively new company that, despite having very different functions, is creating thousands of jobs and declaring war on pollution via the realm of Security Tokens. It is also the first time in the world that a for-profit social enterprise has been tokenized. Bobcoin is a security token that is backed by both stock and assets.\n\nI understand that adding a new coin to your portfolio is risky, but I believe that projects like these are undervalued, and that instead of promoting these meme coins, you should focus on risk management.

At least that is how the organizer, Rodolfo Andragnes, considers it, based on the registrations for both face-to-face and online attendees.\n\nThe inaugural press conference took place at the Bamb\u00fa Center in the city's Zona Rosa, where its organizers, sponsors and even the Ambassador of El Salvador to the United States, Milena Mayorga, participated.\n\nTThe ambassador highlighted several important points about the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador , as well as the holding of the conferences.\n\n\u201cWe had years, or I do not remember, a conference where the eyes of the world were in El Salvador. And the whole world is going to be able to appreciate how the Bitcoin Law has been implemented, how we have a national portfolio like Chivo Wallet \u201d, he said.\n\nIn this sense, he stated that both LaBitconf and the AdoptingBTC conference, which also takes place this week, has revived the tourism sector, taking over hotels with hundreds of bitcoiners, investors , entrepreneurs and enthusiasts from around the world.\n\n*This is an effort to also reactivate, it is an effort led by Rodolfo \\[Andragnes, organizer of LaBitconf\\] and all his staff \\[team\\] and they have made the call; We have accompanied you in giving you all the facilities to meet all the requirements of a conference of this magnitude. It is also a great sign that El Salvador continues to bet on economic freedom, it continues to bet on a new financial model and financial inclusion where Salvadorans around the world are part of the Chivo Wallet. \"*\n\n*For his part, Chris Hunter, co-founder of the Galoy payment infrastructure, which works on the Bitcoin Lightning network, was clear in his goals: to achieve that with Bitcoin any company, person or government, can be their own bank . Hunter is also the organizer of the Adopting Bitcoin conference* [*,*](https://www.criptonoticias.com/comunidad/eventos/adoptando-bitcoin-conferencia-lightning-el-salvador-noviembre/) *more focused on the Lightning network .*\n\n*\"We realized that many banks and business leaders in El Salvador did not yet understand the potential of Bitcoin, which is why we decided to hold the conference,\" he said.*\n\n## Salvadoran programmers attend hackathon on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies\n\n*While the press conference was going on, and during the rest of the day, a hackathon was held , where Salvadoran developers and of all nationalities met to meet the challenge of creating products based on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.*\n\n*The challenges to be met were varied, such as developing applications for the management of institutional payments with bitcoin (BTC), for microcredits based on BTC and other* [*cryptocurrency development*](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development)*, for transparency in public tenders, among others.Well-known developers such as Dulce Villarreal and Francisco Calder\u00f3n , both specialized in Bitcoin and Lightning, as well as Solange Gueiros, with a greater focus on Ethereum and smart contracts, participate as mentors in this hackathon .*\n\n*The hackathon will continue to take place tomorrow, Tuesday, November 16. At the end, the teams will present their developments, opting for prizes of USD 10,000 to distribute, equivalent to an approximate of 0.15 BTC, according to the cryptocurrency price calculator .*",

In response to an interviewer who asked if he had Bitcoin or Ethereum, Cook claimed that he did. In addition, he felt that it was \" reasonable \" to own such assets in a diversified \" portfolio . \"\n\nIn his show, investment expert Anthony Pompliano broke down the implications of Cook's comments and how they could change the crypto industry as we know it today.\n\n### An apple a day keeps the FUD away\n\nFor his part, Cook was clarified that his investment choices did not hint that Apple would accept cryptocurrencies as payment in the future. However, Pompliano felt differently. While acknowledging he didn't know much about Cook's cryptocurrency investments, the investment executive was hopeful that [cryptocurrencies development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) could become part of Apple's business. He asked ,\n\n*\u201cSo is there a day in the future when we will see Apple go ahead and allow payments with Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies? Absolutely, in my opinion ... is there a day where they start to integrate with things like Web 3 or some of the other products and technologies that people are building? Absolutely\u2026\"*\n\nHe additional ,\n\n*\u201c\u2026 Cryptocurrencies will not be a separate industry. Instead\u2026 you are going to get cryptocurrencies to infiltrate all of the existing assets and all of the existing industries. \"*\n\n### It is no longer a 'hard' topic\n\nOne thing that particularly excited Pompliano was how it was getting \u201ccool\u201d to talk about cryptocurrencies, rather than jeopardizing one's professional reputation. He explained ,\n\n*\u201cOf course you can talk about it, professional risk has been eliminated. So whether it's Tim Cook here or someone else in a position of power or influence, whether it's in the financial industry, the tech industry, or somewhere else, they are now allowed to talk about this technology in a way that is expected. . \"*\n\nThe investment executive also suggested that tech leaders would now research cryptocurrencies, engage in the sector to educate themselves, and even add experts to their board of directors to ensure cryptocurrencies don't disrupt their own business models.\n\nThis, in turn, claimed Pompliano , would drive crypto adoption across all industries.\n\n### Innovation with iCloud\n\nBringing Bitcoin to Apple is not a novel idea. American businessman and MicroStrategy co-founder Michael J. Saylor suggested that Apple's iCloud could help transport and store cryptocurrencies for payments. Saylor further claimed such innovation could improve business and defeat banks. He asked ,\n\n*\"If 100 million people have $ 10,000 in iCloud, then you become the largest and most profitable bank in the world in human history, right?\"*",

I recommend you read [this post](https://flight.beehiiv.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) if you haven't already. To summarise very, very quickly: blockchains are public ledgers (think of them as a spreadsheet) that are decentralised, distributed and secured with cryptography.\u00a0\n\n## Single Purpose\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bocdvfona3s81.png?width=211&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ef0711751cc95ba360a8756f331841e1522289c\n\nThis was the first iteration of blockchain technology. Bitcoin is a great example of a single-purpose blockchain.\u00a0The Bitcoin ecosystem was designed to do one thing very well - to facilitate the movement of Bitcoins.\u00a0\n\n## Swiss Army Knives\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/56493g0pa3s81.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e7c28cae334fb4e6f0f0fc33b472f8c4379aca4\n\nVitalik, Ethereum's creator, coined the term \"Swiss army knife\" protocols to describe the next evolution in blockchain networks.\u00a0\n\n*\"Basically, come up with a list of ten or twenty features he wants to have. Make a little, tiny thing for each one of them. Stick them together into a knife. And there you go - that's your product. In this case - that's your blockchain.\"*\n\nThe problem with this approach was that if you found another feature or use case you wanted to support after building your blockchain, there was no way to shoehorn it in.\u00a0\n\n## Ethereum\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0iqddqqa3s81.png?width=225&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3279abf60cde137825b70b3e973763647d3d232\n\nEthereum's aim was to be a blockchain that you can build on top of. Just like the internet, or the app store for mobiles, the idea was that you could go wherever your imagination takes you and just build this functionality on top of the Ethereum blockchain.\u00a0\n\nEthereum has a built-in programming language called solidity. If you have an idea for a new application or a new feature you want to see in the Ethereum network, you can write the rules of this application in a piece of solidity code (called a smart contract) and upload it to the Ethereum network.\u00a0\n\n## Smart Contracts\n\nSo, as we said, a smart contract is a computer program stored inside of a blockchain. Smart contracts are immutable. Once a smart contract has been created, it can never be changed again. They are also distributed, which means that the output of the contract is validated by the nodes in the network, which makes them very difficult to tamper with.\u00a0\n\n## DApps\n\nD'App is just the cool kids' way of saying decentralised application. These are the apps that are being built on the app store that is the Ethereum network. They use smart contracts in the background to work but combine this with front end user interfaces that make it easy for users to use them.\u00a0\n\nIt's important to emphasise the decentralised part of decentralised app. These apps are not like your online banking app or your favourite meditation app, because they are not controlled by a centralised authority. In the case of a normal app, a company is storing your Data. With D'Apps, the nodes on the Ethereum network are used to verify any exchange of information (for example, if you make a transaction on a D'App, the nodes on the Ethereum network will verify this).\u00a0\n\nThe most famous example of a D'App is probably Uniswap. It's an exchange that allows users to swap and trade tokens with people across the internet easily. Aave is a decentralised money market that allows users to borrow and lend tonnes of different cryptocurrencies and is another example of a very popular D'App. And to prove how broad the uses of D'Apps are, we can take the example of Axie Infinity. Axie Infinity is a D'App, but it's not an online exchange or money market - it's a very popular online game built on the blockchain.\u00a0\n\n## Gas\n\nWhen code is executed on the Ethereum network, the number of computational steps that the code takes is counted. Gas is the unit of measurement for this count. The amount of Gas you need depends on how large the contract you are trying to execute is (i.e. how many computational steps there are in that code). And also how fast you want to execute. If you are happy for the execution to be slower, you can expect to pay less in Gas fees. Or if you want to speed up execution, you can do so by paying higher gas fees.\u00a0Gas on Ethereum has a market price determined by the amount of demand there is on the network currently. That's why when there is a big NFT drop on the network, gas fees are incredibly high.\u00a0\n\n## Ether\n\nEther (ETH) is the cryptocurrency that fuels the Ethereum network. It is used to pay for code execution via smart contracts (gas fees). So when you send ETH or use a D'App, you pay a small fee in ETH to use the Ethereum network. This fee that you're paying is used as an incentive for miners to process and verify your transaction.\u00a0\n\n## Issues with Ethereum today\n\n**High gas fees -** When gas fees are really high on the Ethereum network, you can spend up to $150 just on transaction fees alone. This is a big issue and it means it's just not worth paying those fees for smaller transactions. It makes no sense to pay $150 in gas fees to receive $100 worth of ETH. There are many new networks that claim they will be the \"ETH Killer\", and most of them cite high gas fees as the reason why the Ethereum network will be superseded.\u00a0\n\n**Power Usage -** Currently, the Ethereum network, like the Bitcoin network, is secured using Proof of Work. This means that computers have to solve a set of cryptographic puzzles before they can add a block to the Ethereum blockchain.\u00a0 This process uses a lot of electricity, and as the Ethereum network grows, this electricity consumption just increases.\u00a0\n\n**Network Congestion -** This is an example of Ethereum being a victim of its own success. When there is too much congestion on the Ethereum network, this can lead to a slowdown in the time it takes to execute smart contracts and causes issues for apps running on Ethereum.\u00a0\n\n## Upgrades to Ethereum\n\nEthereum is being moved from being a Proof of Work blockchain to a Proof of Stake blockchain network. You can read more about the difference between those two things [here](https://flight.beehiiv.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).\u00a0\n\n* **Scalability -** Currently, the Ethereum network can just process 15 transactions per second. Given how big the network has got, Ethereum needs to support 1000s of transactions per second, and improvements to scalability aim to make this value a reality.\n* **More Sustainable -** The current Proof of Work system uses a lot of energy and computing power, which is terrible for the environment. Switching to Proof of Stake will mean that the Ethereum network will use far less power and be much more sustainable\n* **More Secure -** As the Ethereum network grows in importance, security is one of the biggest concerns, and a lot is being done on this front to improve security on the network.\n\nThese upgrades have been given the cool name of \"The Merge\". If all goes to plan, this will all be ready by the end of Q2 2022. So as you can tell, there are a very important few months coming up for the Ethereum network. Watch this space.\u00a0  \n\n\nIf you enjoyed this, maybe I can tempt you with the [Newbies Crypto newsletter](https://www.newbiescrypto.com/).

It also takes the pressure off those launching their project since the burden of finding donors doesn't fall on their shoulders alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCrowdfunding Bum's commitment to the bum community goes beyond spreading funds among members. It also features a unique WhatsApp chat feature that allows potential backers to message campaign creators. They can ask questions, offer encouragement, or reach out to connect \u2013 and get an immediate reply. This takes connection and community to an unparalleled level within the crowdfunding space. And it has the potential for boosting backer confidence and making campaign financial support more successful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition to these great features, Crowdfunding Bum implements one of crowdfunding's most requested capabilities: acceptance of Bitcoin for those project creators not in Stripe-supported countries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe past few years have seen cryptocurrency interest soar like never before. Worldwide inflation has caused many people to move toward cryptocurrencies to hedge against such risks. As more people invest in crypto, there are growing opportunities for businesses that accept digital currencies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCryptocurrencies make it easier for donors around the world to support crowdfunded projects. Rather than worrying about exchange rates and jumping through the hoops of donating to foreign projects, Crowdfunding Bum makes the process as simple as clicking a button and sharing your wallet address. There are no exorbitant fees to worry about and no red tape to cut through. And thanks to Crowdfunding Bum's Stripe connectivity, if you prefer regular fiat donations, funds can be instantly moved into the campaigner's (Stripe-supported) bank account, so they can work on making their project a reality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCrowdfunding Bum's third iteration is positioned to fulfill its mission of putting fundraising on autopilot for small businesses and entrepreneurs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can discover more by visiting the Crowdfunding Bum homepage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS, the proverbial question, \"If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?\" I can't emphasize enough the need for the reader to share this posting.

The Salvadoran president made the information public through a tweet on his account.\n\nThis would be the buyout announced by Bukele, since the law that made bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador came into force. With this new operation, the reserves of the Central American country amount to 1,120 BTC , about $ 66 million at the current price .\n\n\u201cIt was a long wait, but it was worth it. We just bought the fall! 420 new Bitcoin \u201d, translates Bukele's tweet, originally published in English. \"Buy the fall\" is an expression that is used frequently in the bitcoin space, to denote that declines in price are the best times to buy. Bitcoin has corrected 12% after setting a new all-time high of $ 66,930 per unit, on October 20.\n\nAs reported on September 7, 2021, the date the Bitcoin Law came into effect in El Salvador, President Bukele announced two purchases of 200 BTC each . Subsequently, another two acquisitions for 150 BTC were announced , the most recent, carried out on September 19, also coinciding with a price decline, which took it to $ 45 thousand per BTC. At that time, he accompanied the ad with another tweet where he says: \"They can't beat you if you buy in the fall.\"\n\nSo far, none of the announcements about bitcoin purchases have been accompanied by more details than the amount of the trades . This has generated criticism for the opacity in the management of Bitcoin reserves within El Salvador.\n\nRecently, a Salvadoran media outlet published an investigation in which it indicates that the purchases of bitcoin announced by the president are not officially registered in any of the institutions in charge of the monetary policy of El Salvador.\n\nFor cryptocurrency development contact us\n\n[https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development)",

The company has only just recently announced the Antminer S19 Pro+ Hydro, its previous liquid cooled ASIC miner. This newest model will now achieve a whopping 255 TH/s hashrate, 28% more than the S19 Pro+ Hydro\u2019s 198 TH/s, and 82% more than the base S19 XP model\u2019s 140 TH/s.\n\nThe newest hydro cooled unit will also be Bitmain\u2019s most efficient to date, with an efficiency rating of 20.8 J/TH and a power consumption of 5304W. In comparison, the S19 Pro+ Hydro is rated at 27.5 J/TH with a power consumption of 5445W, while the S19 XP sits at 21.5 J/TH and 3010W. These numbers also make the S19 XP Hydro more than twice as powerful as the base S19 Pro model.\n\nMiners need as much computing power as they can get in order to maximize their mining profits, as earning Bitcoin will only get more difficult, so this announcement comes at the perfect time as the BTC mining difficulty has reached a new all-time high.\n\nMore powerful hardware in turn runs at higher temperatures, hence why Bitmain has once again gone with a liquid cooled solution in order to help keep S19 XP Hydro temperatures in check, preventing overheating and ensuring peak performance at all times.\n\nThe Bitmain Antminer S19 XP Hydro is expected to begin shipping Q1 2023; pre orders will open soon, so stay tuned and sign up for our newsletter to be the first to know about availability, installment payment options, and much more.\n\nPre orders for the S19 Pro+ Hydro are currently open, with shipping expected for July 2022.

These coins are then sent to the official addresses of the Ukrainian government, all in a single transaction.\n\nExplaining the launch, [Uniswap development ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/uniswap-clone-script)claimed that the address shared by Ukraine is on a centralized exchange and only accepts Ether and Tether ( USDT ). Thus, the feature simplifies the donation process for anyone who has ERC-20 tokens listed on Uniswap and wants to donate by connecting their wallet to the DEX.\n\nBut in a tweet cited by the [development of the Uniswap](https://www.blockchainx.tech/uniswap-clone-script) team, some members of the crypto community express concern that \u201cthe keys to these wallets are held by a centralized Ukrainian exchange\u201d and call for a \u201cmore secure custody approach.\u201d . However, Ukraine started accepting donations in Polkadot's DOT token as early as today. Polkadot founder Gavin Wood personally donated $5.8 million in DOT to the newly licensed address. The crypto community has been active in helping Ukraine weather the current war. Aside from donations, efforts like non-fungible token sales to support Ukrainian artists and UkraineDAOhas also gained prominence.\n\nAccording to data tracked by Cointelegraph, the Ukrainian government and non-profit organizations operating in the country have received more than $53 million in donations at press time. The figures are based on tracked projects and do not take into account donations between individuals or those made through various altcoins. Notable donation initiatives include the Ukraine Kuna Reserve Fund, Come Back Alive, and Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether, Tether, and DOT sent directly to Ukrainian government wallet addresses. However, it should be noted that the increase in the value of donations is partly due to capital appreciation due to the current rally in cryptocurrency markets.",

According to Ethereum\u2019s website, [PoW](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/) is important because \u201cthe chain\u2019s length helps the network follow the correct Ethereum chain and understand Ethereum\u2019s current state. The more \u2018work\u2019 done, the longer the chain, and the higher the block number, the more certain the network can be of the current state of things.\u201d\n\nProof of stake (PoS), on the other hand, is performed by validators who have staked ETH in order to participate in the system. Chosen at random, a validator creates new blocks and shares them with the network, earning rewards. Intense computational work isn\u2019t necessary as you simply need to have staked your ETH in the network, which is what incentivises healthy network behavior. PoS also requires users to stake their ETH in order to become a validator, who is responsible for the same thing as miners in PoW: ordering transactions and creating new blocks so that all nodes can agree on the state of the network.\n\n*TLDR: PoS (Future) = No more mining, PoW (Present, about to be extinct) = GPU Mining*\n\n## Ethereum is Moving to PoS\u2026 Again\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to PoS, referred to as \u201cThe Merge\u201d or ETH 2.0, is not a recent development. Beginning in 2017, it was originally planned for launch in 2019. Fast forward to 2022, there seems to be much more confidence circulating around this topic, so why are we talking about it again?\u00a0\n\nBefore we jump into the history lesson, let\u2019s clear up some of the terminology. The Merge refers to the merging of all of the history of ETH 1.0 (all coins, everything) into the ETH 2.0 chain. Once that happens, the mining of Ethereum is no more and the entire blockchain is run by the validator nodes. Of course, if Ethereum can no longer be mined, there is no use for GPUs outside of gaming and the mining of alternative coins, such as Ravencoin, Flux and others. While you can continue mining these coins, the long term profitability is highly questionable and is likely to plummet with the demise of Ethereum mining as we know it. But we\u2019ll get to that in a minute.\u00a0\n\nThe purpose of a transition to PoS is to make Ethereum scalable, more secure, and more sustainable. No mining means eco-friendly. What makes this scalability possible is something called \u201cshard chains\u201d. Shard chains, or sharding, [is a scaling mechanism](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/shard-chains/) that is anticipated to go live in 2023. Instead of dealing with the entire blockchain at the same time, you deal in pieces (think \u201cshards\u201d of glass). The purpose of shard chains is to build a more resilient and more scalable blockchain network.\n\n## A Better Picture\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that a transition to PoS from PoW is just that \u2013 a transition. PoS presents improvements to the PoW model, merging first before being entirely replaced, as demonstrated in the graphic below. These improvements include improved energy efficiency (as you no longer need energy to *mine* blocks), fewer hardware requirements for creating new blocks, and stronger support for the aforementioned shard chains (the key player in scaling the Ethereum network). A transition to proof of stake is also expected to result in more nodes in the network, which significantly improves resistance to centralization.\n\n## The Merge and The Aftermath\n\n*It\u2019s June 2022 and Ethereum has moved to proof of stake.* What happened to all of the miners who were using GPUs to mine Ethereum? Well, since mining rigs are purpose-built, meaning they\u2019re better for mining one specific coin, the GPUs went back into the hands of gamers while crypto miners dove head first into the ASIC market.\u00a0\n\nA significant rise in demand for ASIC mining equipment once Ethereum officially transitions to PoS is not hard to imagine, and that demand is likely to outpace the available supply \u2013 a supply which has already been affected by global supply chain disruptions due to Covid-19.\n\nThe last 18 months have been very profitable for ETH miners in particular. Many of them began their mining journeys with their personal gaming computers, and have since significantly expanded their mining arsenals by building dedicated GPU mining rigs and farms. This was their first foray into full-time crypto mining, so what now? Well, there\u2019s a slim chance they\u2019ll be willing to give that up, and it\u2019s very likely they\u2019ll keep mining simply because they know mining works. It was these 18 months that helped people see the profit potential, and further turned those who were just exploring their curiosity into hardcore miners.\n\nIn light of The Merge, it won\u2019t come as a surprise when these miners sell their used GPUs (gamers rejoice) and start buying ASICs, transitioning to Bitcoin mining. If you\u2019re following our line of logic, an increase in demand and a decrease in supply will cause ASIC prices to jump, making it increasingly difficult to obtain a miner.\n\n## All Roads Lead to Rome\n\nA new wave of buyers is on the way. The influx of GPUs on the secondhand market once the merge occurs will have gamers rejoicing, but they\u2019ll be practically useless for crypto mining. With attention turning to ASICs and Q2 just around the corner, it doesn\u2019t hurt to start thinking about buying an ASIC today to avoid FOMO in the future.\u00a0\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are not only the top 2 coins based on [market cap](https://uk.advfn.com/cryptocurrency), they\u2019re also the top 2 mineable coins. Ethereum\u2019s market cap is half of Bitcoin\u2019s \u2013 based on this alone, considering that market cap correlates with the number of miners per coin, it can be assumed that Ethereum has about half as many miners as Bitcoin.\u00a0\n\nIn translation? Bitcoin is about to gain 50% more miners, and they\u2019re all coming from Ethereum.\n\n[https://wattum.io/blog/ethereum-shifts-to-proof-of-stake-its-effect-on-the-asic-market/](https://wattum.io/blog/ethereum-shifts-to-proof-of-stake-its-effect-on-the-asic-market/)",

Given that bitcoin found its first true use as a medium of exchange on popular (now-defunct) darknet market Silk Road, and the explosion of interest in music-geared NFTs and crypto brands, it\u2019s safe to say crypto is becoming a cultural force.\n\nLast summer, when\u00a0OnlyFans\u00a0decided to boot sex workers off its platform (basically used for holding\u00a0*intimate*\u00a0meetings between creators and fans) many made the call for the adult industry to embrace cryptocurrency. The site, which at the time and is currently filled entirely with bespoke porn, almost killed that business line at the behest of banks. At the last second, OnlyFans reversed course.\n\nThe situation revealed how clearly crypto could benefit the adult industry. Crypto\u2019s technological innovation is pretty simple when it comes down to it: distributed, digital tools are difficult to censor or stop. For an industry that\u2019s routinely under fire by socially conservative moralists, having a little resilience to censorship could help.\n\nNew crypto projects like Splash are emerging to help out drive change in the industry. Besides wanting to be a major name in the adult industry, 3% of each transaction is redistributed amongst all SPLASH holders, providing an incentive to hold tokens and earn passive rewards with ease. The Splash pot receives this 2% fee, which is distributed bi-weekly to all those diamond hands SPLASH holders to enjoy. If Splash hits the jackpot, it can be in for a huge run!",

            "text": " \n\nThe digital asset scene has experienced a drawback in recent times, due to a number of issues emanating from the creation and execution of its many investment openings. Usually, these issues are largely attributed to the distrust and uncertainty that have characterized cryptocurrency inclined events- a major one being the popular ICO crowdfunding.\n\nThe [Smart Valor](https://smartvalor.com/)\u2122 blockchain protocol seeks to create easy and secure access to digital value investments- such that favors the bulk of cryptocurrency investors. All of these comes through the implementation of a detailed and well drawn out roadmap, that is designed to remove most of the prevailing lapses of digital investments, as observed from the perspective of the most vulnerable investors.\n\n**What the Smart Valor protocol aims to achieve**\n\nAccording to the project objective, Smart Valor protocol would essentially democratize access to wealth, using the digital, decentralized technology medium. The project finds relevance for three broad categories of investors and would be suitable for both existing and new digital currency users. Smart Valor allows the diversification of investment tendencies using digital currency blockchain tools. Hence there are useful applications for non-security tokens, as well as asset-backed security tokens. This means that there is something of benefit for asset issuers, and the investors who have put in their monies to the individual projects.\n\nOne essential advantage of the Smart Valor protocol is the fact that it allows people access to less volatile investment possibilities,such as those in real estate and other property ownership ventures. This is important for many intending investors who are okay with the idea of digital assets but are concerned with the issues of unideal volatility traits.\n\nOther stakeholders to benefit from the Smart Valor service deals are institutional investors such as hedge fundraisers, wealth managers etcetera. Asides this, the project stands as a valid opportunity for traditional investors who want to get involved in digital asset investments, in a more secure but less technical interface.\n\n**How to benefit from the company\u2019s value creation**\n\nAll service exchange as provided by the platform has been tokenized and is being powered by its native Valor Token. Asset issuers and investors would be able to carry out transaction activities between themselves and the network, using the tokens. Since agreements would be initiated and executed using smart contracts, the tokens would be the recognized payment medium which is issued out to the deserving party once the conditions have been met.\n\nConsequently, Smart Valor has slated a one-time token sale event, where intending investors would be allowed to opt in on the wide range of investment opportunities packed in on the platform. The ICO is expected to run from October 1st, 2018 till December the 31st. During the sales, 45 million Valor tokens would be distributed to investors, where they are allowed to make payments using either of the bitcoin, ethereum, or any accepted fiat currency.\n\nConsidering the [Smart Valor\u2122project](https://smartvalor.com/) and business roadmaps, digital investment providers and investors are assured of enormous benefits. Asides the fact that they would be having a more secure solution to digital investments, they would also be profiting from value appreciation on their acquired Valor tokens.",

            "text": "  In the last two hundred years, we experienced a decline in poverty and an enhancement of our overall living conditions. The majority of these improvements are a result of universal education, technological improvements and improved models of governance. However, across borders and through different layers of our respective cultures, not all participants in our global society are affected equally.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4gitv3jodjx11.jpg?width=534&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0f10e7e1ac268f51cca85770452a6e80ec59fe3\n\nWhile some of us thrive, our consumption-based economies lead to the destruction of our natural resources and biodiversity. Our fragile debt-based financial systems, aggravated by corruption and bad governance, bring forward economic cycles which involve bubbles and their bursts. A currently relevant example is the hyperinflation striking Venezuela (2018). Many other examples can be given on the symptoms of inadequate governance models lacking focus on the future turning the weaker individuals of our society into victims.\n\nWith the slow realisation of said problems, enabled by the advancements of communication technology, a series of small and large revolts have taken place throughout the world. In some instances, they overthrew countries and proved that with the help of modern technology, people are more powerful than any state, religion or political system. It is in these events that the first stages of a global collaborative movement bringing forward change can be recognized, a movement in which the **Government** **Network** is taking part. The following are examples of an impressive global collaborative movement:\n\n\u25cf 2010 - 2014: \u201cArab Spring\u201d started in Egypt and spread throughout the region\n\n\u25cf 2011 - 2012: \u201cOccupy\u201d started in the United States and spread worldwide\n\n\u25cf 2012 - 2012: \u201cMay Day\u201d protests across the United States and Asia\n\n\u25cf 2013 - 2013: \u201cGezi Park\u201d regional protests Turkey\n\n\u25cf 2014 - 2014: \u201cUmbrella Movement\u201d in Hong Kong\n\n\u25cf 2015 - 2018: \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d in the United States\n\n\u25cf 2016 - 2018: \u201cSyrian Refugee Crisis\u201d global support\n\n\u25cf 2017 - 2018: \u201cIranian Uprising\u201d global protests\n\nCoincidently with the advent of political change, the world is experiencing the rise of a new type of currency, namely, virtual-, cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies find their origin in 2009, after Satoshi Nakamoto's released his whitepaper on Bitcoin, and with it, the invention of distributed ledger technology. In less than a decade, the technology led to the creation of thousands of projects and applications.\n\nThe market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined briefly touched $ 800 Billion at the beginning of 2018, countries have taken steps to integrate crypto in their respective legal frameworks and accept their integration into the economy. Cryptocurrencies and the underlying distributed ledger technology play a key role in the Government Network, enabling its formation.\n\n[https://thegovernment.network/](https://thegovernment.network/)",

The coinmetrics are designed to achieve a Mint-Burn equilibrium for ZNN and QSR as the first dual-coin architecture of its kind.The first use-case of NoM would be to power decentralized infrastructure services that will support further development of next-gen web3 applications. The hybrid applications built on Zenon will fall under a variety of use-cases, covering anything from decentralized storage solutions to DeFi or IoT.\n\nWhat is it:\n\nIncredibly fast, almost infinitely scalable state-of-the-art DLT. It combines the block-lattice architecture with a DAG that exists as a separate layer for the consensus. The block-lattice handles the transactions. It's going to be used to scale Web3 dapps as a L1, and also process transactions as a L2 chain.\n\nWho does it:\n\nThis is an independent, open-source project and will probably be run by a foundation similar to Ethereum and Cardano, but I'm about 99.5% sure its backed by Square. I can enumerate the zillions of times they have hinted as such if I really have to here, but you can search for old biz posts on Zenon here and also on Warosu.\n\nSquare will likely use it to scale Bitcoin transactions where the default payment for merchants and Cashapp users is made in BTC, and then they can set it to dollars or pounds or whatever afterwards.\n\nIts open source and not owned by Square, like how Node.js isn't owned by Google but has wide adoption. They'll easily recruit 1000s of legacy web apps for this bc no code changes are needed, and also dapps on Ethereum will easily switch over.\n\nTestnet is live and not very public yet. Large exchanges expect payment, and/or the coin to already be established within the cryptosphere.\u00a0\n\nAlso you can earn passive income on your $ZNN Avg 55% APY. No need to send it anywhere stake it yourself on your own pc.\n\nYou have been warned anon. This is the one.",

            "text": "  \nThe DIVI project is so huge in my opinion. I\u2019m sure, I am missing a lot. This is just from my most recent and some FactSet researching...  \nFirst of all, the people behind the Divi project have always committed themselves to deal with the arduous task of making cryptocurrency a lot easier to manage, advocacy that will foster the adaption and use of crypto in postmodern times. To achieve this end, the Divi project has decided to power up its cause by joining the banking convention.  \n\n\n**Divi's Swift Solution to Stakeholder's Remittance/Payment Transactions** \n\nFollowing its goal of providing affordable and comprehensible remittance/payment options to its stakeholders, the Divi project was able to partner with a remittance company named Remesas Instantaneous, a San Jose, Costa Rica-based firm whose objective/s coincide with Divi. The company was founded by Mr. Yann and Mr. Stephan and has primarily focused on establishing a seamless and competitive platform that can process financial transactions (both crypto and fiat) in no time.  \n\n\n* The initialization of Divi's remittance office/s posits the following beneficial features to its users:\n* Establishment of bank fiat bank accounts (USD and EUROS) in just one click, whether in mobile or desktop platforms, with up to one thousand five hundred (1,500) dollars per month transfer;\n* Exchange of currency from fiat-to-Divi and Divi-to-fiat in just one click;\n* Worldwide wire transfers within the wallet, and\n* Debit Cards\n\nCooperation with Renesas Instantaneas presents a ton of opportunities and possibilities for the Divi community, considering that collaborating company has a connection with over two hundred (200) countries around the world, permitting the Divi coin to be extracted and employed to international bank account transfers and cryptocurrency transactions. With the company using Divi crypto as another medium for financial negotiations, customers will be introduced to the gist of Divi and the benefits of using crypto. The company has also proposed the plan of providing rebates and discounts to clients for utilizing Divi instead of fiat, or pay even lesser fees if they use Divi instead of cash. The Divi crypto will also be used as a utility token to pay for the registration or modification of all data in the company's Decentralized Domain Name System.\n\n  \n**Divi's Transaction Fees** \n\nDivi's Smart Wallet/s allow the transmission, acceptance, and exchange of crypto and local currencies which include Divi, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, US Dollars, and Euro, among others, to users who are registered and utilizing the supported digital wallets, namely: Divi Wallet, PolisPay, and Midas Protocol. Everyone is invited to visit the [diviproject.org](https://diviproject.org) website to discover more about Divi's supported wallet applications.\n\nDivi's formula towards exchange rates and transaction fees is different compared to other blockchain companies, basing primarily on the transaction amount, with the size of the amount as the secondary multiplier, allowing cheaper and reasonable charges to any financial negotiations. To date, the maximum fee is one hundred (100) Divi, whereas the minimum fee is ten thousand (10,000) Satoshis/KB (0.0001 DIVI/KB).\n\nThe Divi Project has promoted its Dynamic Value Sporks (DVS) placed for fee algorithm variables. The initial Transaction Value Multiplier is equal to 0.0001 of the amount, while the initial Transaction Size Multiplier is three hundred (300).  \nFor instance, if a user sends a ten thousand (10,000) US dollar worth of Divi to another user, the transaction fee would approximately cost one (1) US dollar. This, however, may be altered based on inflation rates in the near future, to which the Divi market has no control or jurisdiction whatsoever.\n\nDivi plans to pursue the seven hundred (700) billion-dollar remittances market. By proposing remittance/payment options with lower prices and superior technology, while at the same time building up a crypto infrastructure with surprisingly very small fees, the Divi project, together with its existing and future associates, shall undoubtedly be able to integrate crypto with the rest of the fiat currencies around the world.\n\nI would be interested to hear other opinions. Great week ahead...",

(OTCQB:  BTCS) (\u201cBTCS\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d),  a  digital asset and blockchain  technology focused company, today   announced it further expanded its  transaction verification services   operation on ethereum 2.0 to 200  nodes. The Company expects the   additional 100 nodes will begin  generating revenue by the end of the   first quarter of 2021.\n\n\u201cWith  a   significantly strengthened balance sheet from the recent $9.5 million    capital raise, we are well-positioned to accelerate revenue growth from    our transaction verification services business and have already  doubled   our ethereum 2.0 staking operation to 200 nodes,\u201d stated  Charles  Allen,  Chief Executive Officer of BTCS. \u201cWith financial  returns  superior to  traditional bitcoin mining, our staking operation  strategy  will drive  strong near-term revenue growth while being more  profitable  than  resource intensive proof-of-work mining and opening  the door to  other  revenue generating operations such as staking as a  service.\u201d\n\nOn   December 1, 2020,  ethereum began transitioning to a \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d   protocol, ethereum  2.0. Under the \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d consensus algorithm,   ETH holders have  the exclusive right to operate validator nodes on the   network and  verify transactions, thereby earning transaction fees for   their work.  In early March 2021, ethereum blockchain developers approved   [EIP 1559](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=S62WUyz6abvuwOa0gqpfEyIH9EO_vmcR3vp6eoGUyIIpuz3C5nVhloM2zj4_Y-rwshUz9F1Jnkmil9nwD-OckvbmWPDQ7K0_DkuiObJ8mbM=),    one of the biggest changes to the network since its 2015 inception,    that will reduce the supply of the Ether cryptocurrency when effective    in August 2021, a move likely to prompt price increases as user demand    grows. BTCS is the first U.S. public company to run validator nodes  on   ethereum 2.0.\n\nAllen continued   \u201cWith more  than $8 million in cash and approximately $14.5 million in   crypto  currencies, we have a solid financial foundation to accelerate   the  execution of our vision.\u201d\n\n**About BTCS:**\n\nBTCS    is an early entrant in the digital asset market and one of the first    U.S. publicly traded companies focused on digital assets and  blockchain   technologies. The Company through its transaction  verification services   business actively verifies and validates  blockchain transactions and  is  rewarded with digital assets for its  work. The Company is also   developing a proprietary digital asset data  analytics platform that   allows users to consolidate their crypto  trades from multiple exchanges   onto a single platform, enabling users  to view and analyze their   performance, risk metrics, and potential tax  implications. The Company   employs a digital asset treasury strategy  with a primary focus on   disruptive non-security protocol layer assets  such as bitcoin and   ethereum.

            "text": "The people behind the Divi project have always committed themselves to deal with the arduous task of making cryptocurrency a lot easier to manage, advocacy that will foster the adaption and use of crypto in postmodern times. To achieve this end, the Divi project has decided to power up its cause by joining the banking convention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDivi's Swift Solution to Stakeholder's Remittance/Payment Transactions \n\nFollowing its goal of providing affordable and comprehensible remittance/payment options to its stakeholders, the Divi project was able to partner with a remittance company named Remesas Instantaneas, a San Jose, Costa Rica-based firm whose objective/s coincide with Divi. The company was founded by Mr. Yann and Mr. Stephan and has primarily focused on establishing a seamless and competitive platform that can process financial transactions (both crypto and fiat) in no time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe initialization of Divi's remittance office/s posits the following beneficial features to its users:\n\n* Establishment of bank fiat bank accounts (USD and EUROS) in just one click, whether in mobile or desktop platforms, with up to one thousand five hundred (1,500) dollars per month transfer;\n* Exchange of currency from fiat-to-Divi and Divi-to-fiat in just one click;\n* Worldwide wire transfers within the wallet, and\n* Debit Cards\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCooperation with Remesas Instantaneas presents a ton of opportunities and possibilities for the Divi community, considering that collaborating company has a connection with over two hundred (200) countries around the world, permitting the Divi coin to be extracted and employed to international bank account transfers and cryptocurrency transactions. With the company using Divi crypto as another medium for financial negotiations, customers will be introduced to the gist of Divi and the benefits of using crypto. The company has also proposed the plan of providing rebates and discounts to clients for utilizing Divi instead of fiat, or pay even lesser fees if they use Divi instead of cash. The Divi crypto will also be used as a utility token to pay for the registration or modification of all data in the company's Decentralized Domain Name System.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nDivi's Transaction Fees \n\nDivi's Smart Wallet/s allow the transmission, acceptance, and exchange of crypto and local currencies which include Divi, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, US Dollars, and Euro, among others, to users who are registered and utilizing the supported digital wallets, namely: Divi Wallet, PolisPay, and Midas Protocol. Everyone is invited to visit the [diviproject.org](https://diviproject.org) website to discover more about Divi's supported wallet applications.\n\nDivi's formula towards exchange rates and transaction fees is different compared to other blockchain companies, basing primarily on the transaction amount, with the size of the amount as the secondary multiplier, allowing cheaper and reasonable charges to any financial negotiations. To date, the maximum fee is one hundred (100) Divi, whereas the minimum fee is ten thousand (10,000) Satoshis/KB (0.0001 DIVI/KB). \n\nThe Divi Project has promoted its Dynamic Value Sporks (DVS) placed for fee algorithm variables. The initial Transaction Value Multiplier is equal to 0.0001 of the amount, while the initial Transaction Size Multiplier is three hundred (300). \n\nFor instance, if a user sends a ten thousand (10,000) US dollar worth of Divi to another user, the transaction fee would approximately cost one (1) US dollar. This, however, may be altered based on inflation rates in the near future, to which the Divi market has no control or jurisdiction whatsoever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDivi's plan is to pursue the seven hundred (700) billion-dollar remittances market. By proposing remittance/payment options with lower prices and superior technology, while at the same time building up a crypto infrastructure with surprisingly very small fees, the Divi project, together with its existing and future associates, shall undoubtedly be able to integrate crypto with the rest of the fiat currencies around the world.",

They are building a protocol that runs on top of a blockchain with smart contract support which allows users to provide excess computational and storage resources in return for payment in DEEP (their native token). They are looking to\u00a0\n\u00a01) Disrupt the traditional cloud computing market dominated by AWS, Google and Azure, going after customers from the IOT sector and AI sector predominately.\u00a0\n2) Provide a fast and scalable blockchain to run\u00a0Web 3.0\u00a0Dapps, something which Bitcoin and Ethereum cannot currently handle due to its low throughput.\nDeepCloud is a decentralized infrastructure as an service (IaaS) which relies on network resource providers (me and you, businesses etc) to provide their computational power and storage resources for financial rewards, An application market place which allows developers to sell reusable components to build Dapps for financial incentives and a developer community providing open source tools for building IOT and Dapp applications for free to entice a strong community of developers (smart move).\nSo what makes this different from the rest?\nDeepCloud key differentiating feature is their\u00a0AI Controller. \u00a0Simple explanation of this would be it controls resources available from the network resource providers and allocate resources proportionally to consumers to avoid bottlenecks and ensure optimal performance.\nDeepCloud is competing with the likes of Golem ($515 million market cap), iExec ($136 mil), SONM ($75 mil). The ico marketcap for DeepCloud is $37.5 mil undiluted, so the upside could be between x2 to 13x. Keep in mind Golem has been establish for a long time and would require significant time if it were to catch up.\u00a0\nDeepcloud Ai promises to disrupt and capture a very large market, cloud computing is only going to grow. On one hand we have a good solid team with great past work experience and good technical advisers, on the other hand there's no hype for it at all, current state of development and blockchain is a mystery. Lack of a business developer advisor, lack of any institutional investment and a smaller upside potential compare to other projects.\nhttps://www.deepcloudai.com/paper/Whitepaper_DeepCloud_AI_Version1_00_ENG.pdf",

The platform will be built on a secure infrastructure consisting of 97% cold storage, advanced vault technology, and 2-factor authentication. We will also offer passive income streams and bonus programs making our platform a very safe and rewarding experience. TraderOne will provide a user- friendly interface, leverage, and liquidity; and improved prices for buying and selling because of relatively low spreads between bids and asks.\n\nWith proper funding, we will also offer a self-pay insurance policy to further protect your funds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Your Centralized Option**\n\nCentralized currency exchanges are the most common type of exchanges allowing users to buy, sell, and trade Bitcoin and other popular altcoins. Traders can store their cryptocurrency on these exchanges. Centralized exchanges differ from other types of intermediaries by requiring buyers and sellers to deposit their fiat money or crypto-assets before trading and registering an account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Basic & Advanced Trading Options**\n\nWe are implementing a \u201cone-click buy\u201d option through a simple user interface. This feature will cater to beginning traders and also include \u201ccopy trading\u201d and social interactions.\n\nOur advanced trading tools and super easy user interface will enable advanced traders to use all of the standard technical analysis indicators with fast click-through rates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**High Level of Security**\n\nAs a guarantor of a transaction, TraderOne holds 97% of a seller\u2019s cryptocurrencies in 100% safe TRUE multi-signature hardware (cold) storage and deposits it into the buyers\u2019 account immediately following payment confirmation. That only places 3% of assets stored in the platform\u2019s hot wallets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Theft Insurance**\n\nOur exchange will provide a secured theft insured system, meaning that we will be one of the first to offer self-insurance on trades. Traders will have the option to enable this feature in their settings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Stable Coin Pairings**\n\nTwo fiat backed stable coins will be available as trading pairs. The EUR and USD coins are digital representations of a Euro and a U.S. Dollar and are issued 1:1 against EUR and USD. More base currencies will be added at a later date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**AdvancedAPIs**\n\nOur advanced Application Program Interfaces (APIs) will allow users to utilize external programs that can be plugged into the exchange, such as trading bots that automatically trade for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWs : [https://www.thecollectivegroup.org/ico/](https://www.thecollectivegroup.org/ico/)\n\nWhite Paper : [https://www.thecollectivegroup.org/ico/WP\\_Collective.pdf](https://www.thecollectivegroup.org/ico/WP_Collective.pdf)\n\nBounty0x Username : caylak135246",

The project was founded in 2011 by Charlee Lee, a real and active person, unlike **Bitcoin\u2019s Satoshi Nakamoto**. The Litecoin project became one of the leading cryptocurrencies on the market. As of writing, the\u00a0[Litecoin market capitalization](https://coinmarketcap.com/)\u00a0takes the 7th place in the world.\n\n \n\n**What are you still waiting for?

It's fast, cheap and accepted by many companies.

You might also want to look for a wallet to manage your **Litecoins. Litecoin** is supported by plenty of wallets, both\u00a0[custodial and non-custodial](https://atomicwallet.io/custodial-non-custodial-wallets-comparison). **Atomic Wallet** supports Litecoin as well.

This has been made possible via their integration with Simplex which only requires you to make a one-time verification after which you can continue to enjoy the service. After paying for cryptocurrency purchase using your bank card, your account will be debited and your cryptocurrency sent to your wallet in less than 24 hours.\n\n### For more information about the project:\n\n* **WEBSITE**:\u00a0[https://atomicwallet.io/](https://atomicwallet.io/)\n* **WHITEPAPER**:\u00a0[https://download.atomicwallet.io/atomicwallet-whitepaper.pdf](https://download.atomicwallet.io/atomicwallet-whitepaper.pdf)\n* **ANN BITCOINTALK**:\u00a0[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4437510.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4437510.0)\n* **TELEGRAM**:\u00a0[https://t.me/atomicwalletchat](https://t.me/atomicwalletchat)\n* **FACEBOOK**:\u00a0[https://www.facebook.com/atomicwallet](https://www.facebook.com/atomicwallet)\n* **TWITTER**:\u00a0[https://twitter.com/atomicwallet](https://twitter.com/atomicwallet)\n\n**Author**: Cacabey\\_40\n\n**BitcoinTalk** Profil:\u00a0[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=242876](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2428766)",

The idea of the project is to create some kind of incubator for companies, on the basis of which they will be able to raise funds for the further implementation of their plans. From the moment of registration on the platform, companies will be assisted in the preparation of documentation, as well as the rules of crowdfunding. At one time, ethereum gained popularity precisely because of the opportunity to raise money for the development of startups. But Ichiba wants to deal with the registration of such companies and their verification by its own, which means that the chance of scam on the Ethereum network will decrease. Thus, companies located on this platform receive advising, support, and audit from Ichibo, and investors, in turn, receive an additional anti-scam filter, which in the future should have a positive impact on the platform\u2019s popularity.\n\nEconomy\n\nSince the coin will live its life\u200a\u2014\u200athe standard collection system using the Ethereum network is not used here.

The coinmetrics are designed to achieve a Mint-Burn equilibrium for ZNN and QSR as the first dual-coin architecture of its kind.The first use-case of NoM would be to power decentralized infrastructure services that will support further development of next-gen web3 applications. The hybrid applications built on Zenon will fall under a variety of use-cases, covering anything from decentralized storage solutions to DeFi or IoT.\n\nWhat is it:\n\nIncredibly fast, almost infinitely scalable state-of-the-art DLT. It combines the block-lattice architecture with a DAG that exists as a separate layer for the consensus. The block-lattice handles the transactions. It's going to be used to scale Web3 dapps as a L1, and also process transactions as a L2 chain.\n\nWho does it:\n\nThis is an independent, open-source project and will probably be run by a foundation similar to Ethereum and Cardano, but I'm about 99.5% sure its backed by Square. I can enumerate the zillions of times they have hinted as such if I really have to here, but you can search for old biz posts on Zenon here and also on Warosu.\n\nSquare will likely use it to scale Bitcoin transactions where the default payment for merchants and Cashapp users is made in BTC, and then they can set it to dollars or pounds or whatever afterwards.\n\nIts open source and not owned by Square, like how Node.js isn't owned by Google but has wide adoption. They'll easily recruit 1000s of legacy web apps for this bc no code changes are needed, and also dapps on Ethereum will easily switch over.\n\nTestnet is live and not very public yet. Large exchanges expect payment, and/or the coin to already be established within the cryptosphere.\u00a0\n\nAlso you can earn passive income on your $ZNN Avg 55% APY. No need to send it anywhere stake it yourself on your own pc.\n\nYou have been warned anon. This is the one.",

            "text": "The use of Atomic swap technology makes the management of cryptocurrency efficient, reliable and easier. This virtual e-wallet belongs to Atomic Wallet (atmoicwallet.io) and uses the same blockchain technology. Also, by its use, there is no involvement of the third party in process of exchanging the currencies between the two-party. For example: If you have a certain amount of BTC (Bitcoin), while the other user possesses an equal amount of ETH (Ethereum) then an atomic swap is a way to exchange the currencies in absence of the middle party.  \n\n\nThe transaction functions in peer to peer connection, thus it is transparent, reliable and can be lightning fast. After all, life is always about saving our precious time. The Atomic Swap Work used by the Atomic Wallet uses two means : On-Chain and Off-chain. Thus these chain works by applying Hashed Time Lock arrangements (HTLCS). This concept is derived from BTC which uses Lightning Network.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nldp65x8yx021.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8d22f87f9f78b980bb33a622bf896c81e0fd9db\n\n**Some of the basic features and benefits of Atomic Wallets are :**  \n\n\n* **There are no limitations on the exchange, and it is easy and reliable.** As it is a new system of exchange, there are hundreds of customers trading every day. Anyone can find their right amount as it is easy to locate another collaborator.\n*  **No fraud.** The use of cross-chain technology makes the exchange reliable. The Atomic Wallet uses its own token called Atomic Pocketbook Coin (AWC). These tokens use the blocks which acts independently without an issue. The data are fixed and works according to the agreements. Also, this Atomic Wallet Token can be run on Ethereum block-chain with ERC-20.\n* **Safety.** Both the party has to agree on a certain deal before the transaction. This process of following a regulation helps to ensure the safety among the users.\n* **Safe Ecosystem.** Since each transaction is signed through a digital signature, it is sent to the blockchain. As soon as the transaction process takes place, the signature becomes committed which means the money will be transferred safely to another wallet. This entire process makes the Atomic Wallet safe place to use, exchange and store the user's cryptocurrency. The advanced security like multi-signature and authentication helps the eco-system grow towards the secure system.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/04zekn0ayx021.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=d211507d563074855e1d72abe70a9a6c9d4090a9\n\nFurthermore, the consumers could deal with the transaction at any time. The token monetary system is regulated in international standard and the price advancement is clarified through the special charter. The Atomic Wallet is also a centralized system which protects the information of the user. The system ensures the safety of user data and protection from cyber attacks, IP penetration by the hackers and the fraudsters. The design of Atomic Wallet is in simplest form and users with any basic knowledge can work on it. The users do not require the additional ability and the time taken by the task are quick and reliable.  \n\n\nIn conclusion, the other cryptocurrency exchange can be harmful to its users because they use central systems with centralized administration. Therefore, Atomic Wallets is recommended to the user which definitely saves the user from the modern cyber problem. The absence of the third-party in the transaction is also the greatest achievement, and the use of Atomic Wallet certainly has its own benefit among the users. \n\n \n\n**LINKS**\n\n[Website](https://atomicwallet.io/)\n\n[White Paper](https://download.atomicwallet.io/atomicwallet-whitepaper.pdf)\n\n[Telegram](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@atomicwalletchat):\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/atomicwallet)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/atomicwallet)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe article is written by [artur2403](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1364957)\n\n&#x200B;",

During that time, ADA added over 50,000 new staking addresses.  Up over 8% since the beginning of June, when ADA reported their final milestone, surpassing 600,000 addresses participating in staking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to the data, this recent outflow brings the total number of current ADA staking addresses to over 662,000.

And since then, Cardano's founder, Charles Hoskinson, has commented on the possibility that the country could adopt the ADA in a similar way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHoskinson revealed details during a recent live broadcast on YouTube about the possibility of acceptance in El Salvador.  More specifically, he shared that his team is negotiating with the authorities in the country.  He also hinted at a possible visit to El Salvador soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Cardano founder also took time during his broadcast to answer questions about Mark Cuban and stablecoin Tether.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other Cardano's activities**\n\nThere's been momentum behind the scenes at Cardano this month.  A regular video update from Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), the co-developers of Cardano, reveals that Alonzo can now run smart contracts.  Delivery team leader Dimitris Poulopoulos explains that contracts are simple at this stage.\n\nThis development is part of the Alonzo Blue phase \u2013 the first phase of Alonzo's rollout.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, Cardano also revealed that it had begun research into the viability of a \u201cstable feed\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIOHK stated in a blog post that stablecoins will provide fair and predictable prices for cryptocurrency transactions.  Reports also indicate that Cardano hopes to build ledger guidelines for its existing platform to easily integrate stable feeds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRead more here:\n\n[https://twitter.com/cardano](https://twitter.com/cardano?s=21)\n\n[https://cardano.org](https://cardano.org)\n\nBUY ADA on BINANCE: [https://www.binance.com](https://www.binance.com)",

The SUQA project team was able to form the idea, values and life path of the coin. It is important to note that the financing of the project was carried out by the team members themselves, as well as ordinary private investors who noticed huge prospects in this coin. Within a few months, the team managed to improve the bitcoin blockchain on the new SUQA network, eliminating vulnerabilities and upgrading it so that the SUQA blockchain was almost 100% secure and not subject to a hacker attack.\n\nThe team has developed an algorithm to reward all owners to attract great interest in the coin. In the first 3 months of running the algorithm, you can get 25% of the amount of invested SUQA coins per month, and after 3 months \u2013 5% per month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0op7ux1ct3421.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb70a381fc94423e77e29e43c61ee1dd04d9de05\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSUQA coins were not generated for the purpose of their subsequent sale to investors on ICO \u2013 this is the main uniqueness of the project, but not the only one.\n\n**What makes SUQA special?**\n\n***Possibility of passive income***\n\nThe project team decided to reward all coin holders with 5% deductions monthly. Look how the system of income works:\n\nBuy / mine SUQA coins on your wallet. Cold wallet is the best way to store coins. You can download it here [https://github.com/SUQAORG/SUQA-CORE/releases](https://github.com/SUQAORG/SUQA-CORE/releases)\n\nI explained in detail how the SUQA coin deposit process works in the picture below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bgt7p6ixs3421.png?width=845&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd3a7016b4393dcf7872ee02142cc1994e8a3db2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSUQA promises 25% profitability for each month of holding tokens in the cold wallet. At the end of 3 months for each month of storage you will receive 5% of the amount of frozen coins.\n\n***High transaction speed***\n\nSUQA coin has a high transaction speed - 533 per second. This is 75 times higher than bitcoin! Today, this fact is a serious advantage over the main competitors.I am sure that this is not the limit of possible speed for developers and it will be even more in the future. There are practically no transaction fees in the SUQA ecosystem.\n\n***X22i algorithm***\n\n**X22i** is an unique PoW algorithm developed by the SUQA team. It is worth noting that at the moment X22i is the most energy efficient of all the algorithms on the market, as it works steeper and does not consume a lot of energy. The algorithm has super stability to ASIC miners and quantum computers.By the way, guys, CPU mining is very easy and available from the desktop wallet. GPU mining is available from open source GPU miners just by adding the server and wallet address.The best hashing miner software for 1080ti is Cryptodredge because it's currently fastest miner for x22i. Here download links [https://github.com/technobyl/CryptoDredge/releases/tag/v0.11.0](https://github.com/technobyl/CryptoDredge/releases/tag/v0.11.0)\n\n**Important advantages over competitors**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26vy3ym1t3421.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=509c61f81db4a6a24a6e6a7d6d95dbb16d59f9d1\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI have extensive experience in mining various kinds of cryptocurrencies, and I can say with confidence that SUQA is very promising coin. It is important to note that the team is constantly improving its product and trying to be sociable with its users. This is a huge advantage over competitors.\n\n**More info**\n\nTo learn more about all the latest information about SUQA, you can join the [discord channel](https://discord.gg/qrtU7Y9) or [telegram channel](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@Suqafoundation)\n\n[Website](https://suqa.org/) / [ANN thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5038269.msg46187093#msg46187093)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAuthor - [artur2403](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1364957) / [Uniqueness - 100%](https://text.ru/antiplagiat/5c055bee7685a)",

This will make Quantum1Net a significantly research-intensive company.\n\n### Protocol\n\n\u00a0The laboratory prototype of the Quantum Random Number Generator from Quantum1Net, which has been under development since 2014, is based on a 1-bit optical device, which uses four photon detectors and a time to digital (TDC) converter to generate sets of perfect random numbers with time stamps. The quantum device consists of a source of interlaced photons and linear optical elements, which establishes the quantum system in the desired state. Two configurations have been developed to generate sets of 4 and 6 elements respectively. The result of TDC is the temporary queue, from which sets of unique random numbers or encryption keys can be requested, creating a real-time, on-demand encryption and decryption system.\n\n### Roadmap\n\n\u00a0Quantum1Net expects to continue development during the first half of 2018.\u00a0\n\nHiring additional developers in March 2018 should allow us to finalize the initial QEKG development the following month, supporting a limited Quantum1Net implementation in May.\u00a0\n\nThe final design for the hardware-based Quantum Key Generation should be completed in July, followed by the signing of manufacturing partners by the end of summer 2018.\u00a0\n\nAutumn 2018 is when we expect to start running towards a global Quantum1Net release in January 2019.\u00a0\n\nWe expect the alpha version of the Quantum1Net file transmission platform initially during September, and a beta version in November 2018.\u00a0\n\nThe release version is likely to be completed the following month, paving the way for the global Quantum1Net publication targeted for Q1 2019.\n\n### Token\n\n\u00a0First sale token: Silver symbol\u00a0\n\nFebruary 2018 - February 2018\u00a0\n\nEthereum-base\u00a0\n\nconvertible to gold token at 20% discount\u00a0\n\nSale of the cap of 15 million euro\u00a0\n\nObjectives\u00a0\n\nSupports the change to the new office to centralize development\u00a0\n\nRecruitment of new developers at the July 2018 meeting Limited Quantum1Net Quantum1Net release\u00a0\n\nSecond sale token: gold chip (closed)\u00a0\n\nJuly 2018\u00a0\n\nbased on Bitcoin, including QEK\u00a0\n\nsilver token investors get priority token investors get\u00a0\n\n18 million maximum sales of\u00a0\n\nObjectives\u00a0\n\nOffer a proof of concept of Our QEK, this token's quantum enclosed encrypted token\u00a0\n\nSupports development of the hardware and software transmission platform\u00a0\n\nToken (open) - January 2019\n\nBitcoin-based, QE enabled\u00a0\n\nSilver Token investors who converted in July 2018 the sale can participate in the 5% discount - Silver Token investors who converted in July 2018 the sale can participate in the 5% discount\u00a0\n\nSale capped at 200 million euros\u00a0\n\n Bounty0x ID: chemist32",

The AIB ecosystem allows cryptoasset investors to use their cryptoassets as collateral to access loans in fiat currency.

During the struggle, he found that even the smallest loan could play a decisive role for the poor. He issued his first microloan from his pocket to 10 women who made bamboo furniture; the loan amount was only USD 27. At the same time, Yunus discovered that ordinary banks are not interested in lending to wealthy entrepreneurs; banks see this as a high risk. In 1983, Yunus founded the Grameen Bank, which began to provide microloans to people in need in Bangladesh. Since 1983, this bank has already issued more than 4 million loans totaling about USD 5 billion. To guarantee repayment of loans to the bank, a pledge system was used: among the lenders, informal groups were formed, whose members trusted each other and supported each other.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAIB is a platform that offers credit products guaranteed by customer equipment, cryptocurrency, and other blockchain assets.

The main purpose of the Wolfcoin blockchain is to provide fast and secure transactions through management, which helps to maintain the network for the benefit of all users. Blockchain Wolfcoin is a two-level network of coordinated proof of work (pow) running from the miners, proof and service system (posture), working from the master nodes. Miners receive rewards for the security of the blockchain, and the master nodes for the simplification of network functions, including sending private and instant send. Wolfcoin uses the X11 hashing algorithm and is based on the bitcoin core code version 0.12.\n\nThe Wolfcoin blockchain is protected by proof of work (Ol) in which miners attempt to solve complex problems using specialized computers. When the problem is solved, the miner is allowed to add a new block to the block chain. If the problem has been solved correctly, the miner receives a reward after adding a block. The second layer, based on master nodes, allows Wolfcoin to simplify private and instant transactions via private sending and instant sending. Masternodes are also rewarded when miners open new blocks.\n\nThe block reward is distributed from 80% to master nodes and 20% to miners. The master node system is referred to as proof of service (posture) because master nodes provide critical services that support network functions. Masternodes also control the network and can deviate incorrectly formed blocks from the miners. If the miner tries to claim the entire block for himself, the master node network will lose the block, ensuring that it is not added to the block chain.\n\nIn short, miners power the first level, which is the primary sending and receiving of funds and preventing double spending. Use the second level Masternodes, providing additional features that distinguish Wolfcoin from other cryptocurrencies. Masternodes are not mine, and mining computers cannot serve as masternodes. In addition, each mastered \"protected\" 10,000 wolves. These wolf always remain under the sole control their owner. Funds are not blocked in any way; however, if sufficient funds will be moved or spent to the number of assets a user has fallen below 10,000 Wolfcoin, the master node will shut down and cease to receive a reward.\n\nWhen you keep at least 10,000 Wolfcoin In your Wolfcoin wallet connected to a static IP address, you'll become a masternode, meaning you'll have a chance of getting 80 percent of the block reward every sixty seconds.\n\nRedeemable for WolfpackBOT and Wolfcoin clothing and goods\n\nMushroom utility that can be exchanged for the same value on exchanges\n\nWhen you keep at least 10,000 Wolfcoin In your Wolfcoin wallet connected to a static IP address, you'll become a masternode, meaning you'll have a chance of getting 80 percent of the block reward every sixty seconds.\n\nWhat's crowdsale?\n\nCrowdsale can allow companies to raise capital through crowdfunding by offering useful coins that can be exchanged for their products and / or services. The client must participate in the company's crowdsale only after the company, its products and its team have been researched and tested, and only if the client believes in the project viability and competence of the project staff. Customers benefit from participating in mass sales by realizing potential rewards such as reduced prices and / or subscription fees for offered products or services, and the company benefits from securing sales of products or subscriptions and raising the necessary capital to launch or expand its operations.\n\nWhy Wolfcoin?\n\nAlong with the development of WolfpackBOT, a highly developed cryptocurrency trading bot, Wolfcoin is offered to users as a utility that can be exchanged for wolfpackbot subscriptions, a console on the WolfBOX console, WolfpackBOT and on Wolfcoin clothing and merchandise. This utility, combined with X11's blockchain proof of work reward systems with mining and master nodes, allows Wolfcoin to be used by all WolfpackBOT users who are interested in receiving additional Wolfcoin for subscriptions, products, and other rewards.\n\nWeb site: https://www.wolfpackbot.com\n\nTechnical document: https://www.wolfpackbot.com/Pdf/whitepaper\\_en.pdf\n\nBounty0x ID: ecamli",

Inzura premium is designed in such a way that user's benefit is the primary task and to serve best in class and protect their asset. Inzura provides their users with special premium renewal benefits. Unlike traditional insurance method, where institutions completely takes insurance amount from user's premium after expiration of premium validity, Inzura is built clearly to benefit users, where when premium expires, 50% of the token is refunded to user's wallet, and when a new premium is purchased within 4 days of last premium expiration, users get 20% extra token of their last premium. Post claimant benefits have been initiated, where if the worth of the premium is higher than the worth of the crypto asset in the exchange at the time of claimant, the balance IZA token will be refunded to user's wallet. For instance: Balina has 400 IZA token with which he purchased a premium that is worth $2000 (based on FAP) and he has only $1000 worth of Bitcoin in an exchange and Balina is in a situation to claim the premium. In this case, Balina actually needs 200 IZA token to claim the $1000 worth of Bitcoin. Balina will only be charged for 200 IZA token for his $1000 worth of Bitcoin and the rest 200 IZA token will be refunded to his wallet. In the vice versa case, if Balina has 200 IZA token and purchased a premium that is worth $1000 and he is in a situation to claim $2000 worth of crypto asset, then he can claim only $1000 worth of crypto asset and the premium will be settled. \n\n [https://www.inzura.world/#/home](https://www.inzura.world/#/home) \n\n [https://www.inzura.world/static/media/Inzura%20Whitepaper%20v1.2.2.fe2b638e.pdf](https://www.inzura.world/static/media/Inzura%20Whitepaper%20v1.2.2.fe2b638e.pdf) \n\nbounty0x ID: hllelek33",

            "text": " \n\nThe emergence of Cryptocurrecy has brought a drastic change into our world and has given redefinition to the way things are done all around the world.\n\nThe financial world and the entire global economy have felt the undeniable impact of the digital currency.\n\nThe truth is that, cryptocurrency has given lots of relief to people in the area of worldwide and border less transactions. Sending and receiving funds from any part of the world to another has been made easy without passing through the financial institutions which makes the transaction easier, faster and efficient.\n\nThe digital currency has not only given transaction ease to the users but also fortune. Many people\u2019s life have been changed positively by the virtue of crytocurrency trading and transactions as they engage it as a means of investment and trade when the value goes up.\n\nMeanwhile, a major challenge facing the cryptocurrency-world is the problem of crypto-exchange. Man people have had their fingers burnt by making transactions on some unwholesome crypto-exchange platforms.\n\nProblems of some Crypto-exchange Platforms. High transaction fee /commission A common problem with many existing cryptocurrency exchange platform is high rate of commission charged. It might so frustrating for crypto traders both old and new when one discovers that the fees charged by exchange platforms are too exuberant. Sometimes it leaves you with no option than to leave your coins in your wallet instead of trading it with huge exchange commission.\n\nSecurity Security is a major issue bedeviling cryptocurrency exchange platforms all around the world. This does not exclude even the exchanges that have made names for themselves in the crypto-world. We have cases of hacking into the exchange websites and carting away with huge fortune from innocent traders. There are cases of compromise in exchange wallets which has led to great losses.\n\nDeposits/Withdrawal Issues On some crypto-exchage platforms, you paid certain percentage of the coin you are about to deposit for exchange, and not only that, but also you pay trading fee and when you are done with transaction and want to withdraw, you still pay some stipulated fees. This kind of experience makes crypto-exchanges look like scam to many people.\n\nCustomer Support Service Part of the problems of many crypto exchange platforms is lack of responsive support team or customer care unit to put users through and offer assistant when needed. It takes days for the customer care service of some exchange platform to response to your queries.\n\nFIAT Conversion Problem Many of platforms that deal on cryptocurrency exchange only deal on crypto to crypto exchange. That is, changing a cryptocurrency coin like Ethereum (ETH) into Bitcoin (BTC) but leave the user with task of getting their crypto coins converted into FIAT the conventional currency or converting FIAT into cryptocurrency\n\nThe good news! The good news is that, there is an exchange platform known as Crypton exchange which has come to profer solution to the problem posed by many existing crypto currency exchange platforms in a unique and definite way.\n\nCrypton\u2019s primary task is to create the safest and most convenient cryptocurrency exchange for customers, with distinctive features. Our main focus will be low fees and real-time support for users as well as a simple and clear UI/UX experience. Whether you\u2019re depositing, withdrawing or simply exchanging crypto for FIAT, the design will be intuitive and built with the user in mind Crypton gives its vision of another standard for digital money trade filling the hole among crypto and fiat cash while concentrating on a client\u2019s assets, as a matter of first importance.\n\nFeatures of Crypton Exchange \u2022 Low transaction fee\n\nThe commission charged by crypton exchange is very low compared to other existing cryptocurrency exchange platforms. The trade gives low comission on making tasks\u200a0.1% while if you are paying with crypto and 0.05% if paying in the exchange native token (CRP).\n\nIn that sense, exchanging tasks, buy and selling are ending up progressively gainful and increasingly available to everybody. The accompanying way, the organization will make up for it and get paid by virtue of turnover, yet not on the ground of high comissions charged.\n\nFor More Information\n\nWebsite: [https://cryptonx.io/market](https://cryptonx.io/market)\n\nWhite paper: [https://cryptonx.io/docs/cryptonX\\_white](https://cryptonx.io/docs/cryptonX_white)",

Javvy will earn revenue from the tried-and-true method of fees on buy/sell transactions, conversion fees, KYC/AML/Accreditation verification services, international debit card fees, and merchant settlement fees. The Javvy app is currently available on Windows and mobile (iOS and Android), with Linux and Mac planned shortly after funding.\n\n**What problem are you solving?**  \nThe lack of a consolidated and intuitive crypto solution simple enough for mass adoption.\n\n**Who are your competitors? Who might become competitors?**  \nBinance, Coinbase, Blockchain.info. Others have even weaker offerings but there are many smaller competitors.\n\n**What are the main challenges your project will face in the next 1-3 years?**  \nEducating mainstream that the wallet should be the first and last foray into crypto. Users should not worry about finding or trusting unproven crypto exchanges, which are mostly web-based and insecure. They should simply be able to install the Javvy application and immediately begin buying, selling, managing, and using all major cryptocurrencies within a single, safe, and secure application.\n\n**Tell us what you know about your target users.**  \nThe early adopters will be crypto-savvy users, likely already using competing exchanges and wallets. Eventually, we will expand into mainstream markets, due to the ease-of-use of our solution that other exchanges and wallets have failed to provide \u2013despite hundreds of millions invested and many years to do so.\n\n**What\u2019s new about what you\u2019re doing?**  \nNot web-based (more secure). Everything required for most crypto uses within a single, secure application. Support all cryptos/tokens. Consolidating crypto exchanges and wallets so that users don\u2019t need to search for both and learn about how everything works (it should just work). Users should be able to simply install an app on any device or desktop and begin using crypto. This is Javvy.\n\n **What is the purpose of the token?**  \nThe Javvy token will give token holders the option to use JVY tokens to pay buy/sell/convert fees for a 50% discount. Additionally, tokens may be \u201cstaked\u201d to provide liquidity to the network and earn more tokens in return.\n\n**Could it be done with Ethereum or Bitcoin? Why or Why not? What\u2019s useful about a separate token?**  \nNo. A solution such as Javvy\u2019s requires significant investment into application development, regulatory and compliance research, etc.\n\n**What stage of development are you in? (research, development, launched, etc.)**  \nMVP released on July 4th, 2018, with numerous improvements and features added since then. We currently provide apps for Windows, iOS, and Android. Mac and Lunix versions will be added shortly after funding.\n\n**What traction does your project have?**  \nDespite putting 99% of our funds into product development and legal research, our initial small marketing push went viral, with a huge outpouring of positive sentiment across the crypto community. After Javvy went viral, our Telegram community grew from 190 to over 38,000 in less than a week (15,000 in under 24 hours!). Those who joined have tentatively pledged \\~$5MM USD of our $8MM USD max cap already. During the \u201cprivate sale\u201d phase, we have already surpassed our soft cap and are in negotiations now with ICO pools. Our CEO, Brandon Elliott, has spoken at numerous pitch events and conferences (invited and upgraded for free; not paid sponsorship). In addition to going viral, Javvy has been featured on national radio and is scheduled to air on Fox Business Worldwide with Kathy Ireland on Nov 4, 10, and 11\u2026 with a longer feature segment airing late November. Javvy will be the first crypto venture to receive mainstream media attention, especially on worldwide Television (North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia) to over 400 million household viewers.\n\n&#x200B;",

A public blockchain is a globally accessible ledger, with decentralized management operated by a network of peers which comply within an open source protocol. This network acts as the same place for the record of ownership and its transfer.\n\nThe transfer of ownership of any asset-backed token issued on the blockchain can be equally **fast,** **secure** **and** **cost-efficient** as the transfer of Bitcoin or Ether on their respective networks. Figure 3 illustrates the difference between an exemplary share transfer via traditional process versus blockchain.\n\nFigure 3:\n\n**Share transfer** **via** **traditional** **(top)** **versus** **blockchain** **(bottom) technology**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1h5cpi88mma21.jpg?width=927&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc8a7ffaa14335dad351538ac9e800076ff5b173\n\n In addition to the advantages mentioned above, the global distribution of security tokens can be significantly simplified. \u201cWhen securities are tokenized, compliance can be automated, which means that regulated trade will no longer be restricted to walled gardens. Security tokens will be able to trade anywhere, including decentralized exchanges. Further, baking compliance into the token could help market participants navigate the extremely complex task of selling securities across borders\u201d10. \n\n WP: [https://smartvalor.com/](https://smartvalor.com/) ",

Mining is not just a way to make money, miners solve critical math problems, approve other people's processes in the network, and open new blocks. At the same time, mining guarantees decentralization of the system, while helping to protect the blockade Pirates from attacks and fraud. MinedBlock now enables investors to use resources from large-scale crypto mining operations without having to purchase, install and maintain expensive mining equipment.\n\nMinedBlock provides mining services as a product that the company manages all the equipment and ensures that they work best throughout the day with low operating costs and high productivity. This Krypto mining company can provide customers with special services at this level because they will establish a mining facility that emphasizes the mining of the highest subcoins with market capitalization to guarantee a wide range of revenue streams. Using this large-scale mining operation, MinedBlock will help improve the decentralization of subcoins, as well as increase its decentralization through international distribution of data centers.\n\nA fundamental principle of minedblock is to ensure that customers achieve the highest level of transparency. Therefore, the company plans will be completely clear on revenue generation and progress in the ongoing mining field. As with the same panels and instant updates, it will be used to show the latest hash rates, including all cryptographic minesweeper, as well as mbtx tokens and projected revenues. MinedBlock is also committed to shaping mining projects according to customer feedback.\n\nMinedBlock will continuously monitor mining activities and switch between altcoins when success rate and difficulty fluctuates. The ultimate goal will be to maintain maximum efficiency during operations to increase profits and minimize resource wastage. The company will also determine whether using existing mine pools or relying on their own mixed ratio will produce the best yield.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn hardware, mineblock will deploy a mix of GPU mining units that are customized with ASIC towers. While different ASIC suppliers are used to avoid any centralization and also to increase the variety of customers, all mining equipment will often be replaced and resold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor location, climate and electricity costs are primary issues as well as the political acquisition of the host country. The first mining farm will use the ASIC BCH and bitcoin mining units and will be hosted at an Iceland facility where electricity costs and climate are advantageous. Meanwhile, the GPU towers will first be installed in Canada, Canada, Sweden or Iceland before moving to facilities.\n\n \n\n[MinedBlock Website](https://www.minedblock.io/)\n\n[Whitepaper](https://www.minedblock.io/assets/MinedBlockWhitepaper.pdf)\n\nBounty0x username: demirci",

ICO $1 and ATH over $50.\n\nThis project is in the sweet spot of fundamental buying opportunities because it has a working product, there is active development from the team AND marketing has not yet commenced. It is due to do so later this year.\n\n[Genesis Vision](http://genesis.vision) is an asset management platform. Users can invest in a variety of different investment structures. This includes:\n\n1) Funds - essentially custom index funds/ETFs - allowing you to invest in multiple crypto coins with the click of a button. Think Crypto20 but custom made. These can be created by the user or they can choose to invest in someone else\u2019s fund. All rebalancing is done automatically. Top performing funds this year have returned around 180%. \n\n2) Programs - investing in day traders. You profit from their trading activities and they take a cut, usually 5-20%. At no time do the traders have final control of your money - they cannot withdraw your money - the platform guarantees this. Program managers can trade not only crypto but stocks, Forex, commodities through Exante and Just2Trade. There are also a variety of bots available to be used or create your own.\n\nThis is a great option for those who want a higher risk investment opportunity, as at times program managers have returned triple digit % profits. Users can also choose to become program managers themselves and earn profit from successfully investing other user\u2019s funds.\n\n 3) Copy Trading - similar to programs however the user decides which trades to partake in. The user receives a notification from a trader about a trade and can decide whether to copy it with their own funds or not. This gives a bit more autonomy to the user.\n\nThe Genesis Vision team have focused on creating a spectacular platform before ramping up marketing. This means that the user base has grown only very slowly since the platform was released late last year. With Bitcoin\u2019s recent dominance pushing the token price lower many have thought GV is on the way out, but a closer look reveals that this is far from the case. The platform is thriving and provides a unique and fun investment opportunity.

Gozo will use a four-layer architecture, as follows:\n\n\n\n1. Multi-Platform Application Layer This layer provides services both to apps (Android, iOS, web apps, etc.) and decentralized services along with a global crypto wallet. This layer is fully developed with the following features:      \u2022 ReactJS as front-end, migrating to React Native      \u2022 Customized React interface based on GraphQL for business intelligence and econometrics.      \u2022 AI Chatbots for support services and lead acquisition - Services to apps (Android, iOS, web apps, etc...)\n\n\n\n2. Microservices + API Layer This interface gathers together the methods and functions for the services that work to integrate the platform with third-party websites and apps.      \u2022 Designed to operate in the main languages: ReactJS, JavaScript, Python, PHP, and Ruby      \u2022 Kubernetes for microservices - NodeJS as core - ORDS as a NoSQL DB      \u2022 R and Python for big data analyses      \u2022 Pytorch for deep learning      \u2022 Redis and environments for other projects built around the API \n\n\n\n3. Token Layer (GOZO) Fully tradable, the GOZO token is created on the Stellar platform. The GOZO token follows the Stellar standard and is fully integrated with this ecosystem, and is also able to be stored on XLM wallets. \n\n\n\n4. Stellar Ledger Layer In  this  layer,  Gozo  will  store  users\u2019  immutable  travel  and  rewards  records,  results  from  the  transactions between all participants, as well as the relevance of the users within the Ecosystem. The choice of Stellar as platform to deploy the APP is due to many reasons, including:      \u2022 Speed - Stellar is able to run about 1,000 transactions per second, far more than Ethereum\u2019s 15 transactions per second and Bitcoin\u2019s 4 transactions per second      \u2022  Aordability - Stellar transactions cost .00001 XLM per transaction      \u2022 Stellar provides the Horizon API-centered connectivity and JS libraries, in line with the technological stack on Gozo      \u2022 Stellar federation allows Gozo to identify payment, by mapping user addresses and transaction IDs across dierent domains.\n\nhttps://www.gozo.io\n\nBounty0x Username: Osoname",

            "text": "hello friends I'll tell you little about **KABN** project, but first I want to tell you about the security of crypto money\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe purpose of creating crypto money is to provide digital information exchange with a process that is made possible by certain cryptography principles. The purpose of cryptography is to secure money transactions and control the creation of new funds. The first Crypto Para is Bitcoin in 2009. Today, hundreds of different crypto currencies are used and they are often called \u201calternative crypto money G\u00fcn\u00fcm\u00fczde. In other words, crypto is like an electric current that is converted into code by lines with a monetary value. Even simpler, crypto money is a digital currency. Unlike central banks, where governments have determined the value of their currency, no government has control over crypto money. Because there is no center to control this money.\n\nMany crypto coins (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) are designed to be produced less in time, thus creating a market value. This is different from the currencies used by states. Because the government can print more money at any time on favorable terms and thus increase the inflation. For example, in the Bitcoin market, there will be no more than 21 million units of units. Although there are hundreds of crypto currencies, most of them have emerged using one of two protocols; POW or PoS. All Crypto Coins are kept by crypto-money miners who have prepared their computers or ASIC machines to ensure the verification and processing of money transactions.\n\n## KABN Ecosystem\n\nThe KABN Ecosystem offers customers the ability to prove their identity without providing sensitive documentation to 3rd parties and to harness the power of digital currencies and to convert and spend them like traditional currencies, or Fiat, anywhere that Visa is taken while engaging in robust engagement and loyalty programs that provide continuous value.\n\nThe KABN Network is an integrated suite of financial services that includes the Pegasus Flyte Visa Card, an approved crypto-linked prepaid Visa card and mobile integrated multi-currency banking wallet; KABN KASH, a robust loyalty and engagement program and the network anchor, KABN ID, a patent pending, Always On, GDPR complaint, blockchain and biometrically based, identity verification and validation platform.\u00a0\n\nKABN\u2019s mission is to create a world-class suite of products and services that support the decentralized market economy, globally enabling consumers to take control of their digital identity and personal data, connecting them with Cryptocurrency-linked financial services and loyalty platforms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ouetjza9sly21.jpg?width=447&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=914b55fdf7c2add23facd1fe93f77ecc8ea3eb60\n\n \n\n**THE PROBLEM KABN SOLVES**\n\nAs cryptocurrencies and other digital currencies grow globally, there is an ever-increasing need to convert them into traditional currencies (i.e. USD and Euros) for use in traditional spending.\n\nKABN\u2019s integrated suite of products, which has received approval by Visa, solves this major challenge by empowering digital currency holders to spend in-store and online, as well as, access ATMs globally wherever Visa is accepted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\\*Pre-production cart art subject to network approval*\n\n* A mobile banking wallet that manages multiple traditional currencies and digital currencies via links to crypto partners and exchanges as well as offering other financial features and services\n* A robust loyalty and engagement platform, providing Customers with additional value-added services.\n* KABN\u2019s anchor product, KABN ID, is a patent-pending, GDPR compliant, Blockchain and biometrically-based, \u201cAlways On\u201d ID validation and verification platform.\n* The KABN ID proprietary process allows for efficient and frictionless onboarding, allowing Customer\u2019s to control the use of their verified identification without having to provide confidential documentation to unknown 3rd parties.\n\n**KABN Card**\n\nKABN has been approved to issue a reloadable prepaid Visa card starting in Europe in Q1-Q2 2019 and intends to expand to other jurisdictions. Each consumer customer who is screened and passes the KYC/AML on the KABN platform is eligible to receive a KABN-issued Visa card and corresponding banking wallet.\n\nThe KABN Card program aims to allow spending crypto in the real world. Presently, it is difficult to convert cryptocurrency into local currency. Exchanges increasingly offer trading pairs with stable coins instead of actual local currency. In many cases, withdrawals take weeks via international wire transfers. There are certainly exchanges that allow same-day withdrawals but these, management has found, are rare and in the minority. In certain cases, transfer fees are only viable for large deposits and withdrawals. With the KABN Card Consumers can immediately convert their crypto currency into fiat.\n\n**KABN\u2019s technology has been built, their partners are in place, they have been approved by Visa and they are ready to go for their European launch in the 2nd\u00a0quarter with an expected expansion to North America later this year.**\n\nWebsite: [https://www.kabntoken.com/](https://www.kabntoken.com/)\n\nWhitepaper: [https://www.kabntoken.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/KABN-Company-Overview-Summary-V1.2.pdf](https://www.kabntoken.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/KABN-Company-Overview-Summary-V1.2.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bounty0x Username:** arifcakir13",

Since Inzura protects most valuable crypto asset, more and more new users will start to use cryptocurrency without fear of losing thei r crypto asset. Inzura premium is designed in such a way that user's benefit is the primary task and to serve best in class and protect their asset. Inzura provides their users with special premium renewal benefits. Unlike traditional insurance metho d, where institutions completely takes insurance amount from user's premium after expiration of premium validity, Inzura is built clearly to benefit users, where when premium expires, 50% of the token is refunded to user's wallet, and when a new premium is purchased within 4 days of last premium expiration, users get 20% extra token of their last premium. Post claimant benefits have been initiated, where if the worth of the premium is higher than the worth of the crypto asset in the exchange at the time of claimant, the balance IZA token will be refunded to user's wallet. For instance: Balina has 400 IZA token with which he purchased a premium that is worth $2000 (based on FAP) and he has only $1000 worth of Bitcoin in an exchange and Balina is in a si tuation to claim the premium. In this case, Balina actually needs 200 IZA token to claim the $1000 worth of Bitcoin. Balina will only be charged for 200 IZA token for his $1000 worth of Bitcoin and the rest 200 IZA token will be refunded to his wallet. In the vice versa case, if Balina has 200 IZA token and purchased a premium that is worth $1000 and he is in a situation to claim $2000 worth of crypto asset, then he can claim only $1000 worth of crypto asset and the premium will be settled.\n\nINZURA is the world's first ever insurance token that is built with best in class protocol implemented to protect the crypto asset. INZURA is the world's first crypto insurance where you can claim your loss of cryptocurrencies with INZURA token.

            "text": "Migrating assets to the blockchain offers several major advantages over traditional securitization or other forms of digitalization. These advantages are summarized here.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z3mpm5tccyw11.jpg?width=927&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0024821e32be25f2b9ed9d6aede142e1c4277c20\n\nFigure 2:\n\n**Advantages** **of** **Tokenization**\n\nThe major advantage of tokenization is that the digital representation of the ownership rights is created on a public blockchain9. A public blockchain is a globally accessible ledger, with decentralized management operated by a network of peers which comply within an open source protocol. This network acts as the same place for the record of ownership and its transfer.\n\nThe transfer of ownership of any asset-backed token issued on the blockchain can be equally **fast,** **secure** **and** **cost-efficient** as the transfer of Bitcoin or Ether on their respective networks. Figure 3 illustrates the difference between an exemplary share transfer via traditional process versus blockchain.\n\nFigure 3:\n\n**Share transfer** **via** **traditional** **(top)** **versus** **blockchain** **(bottom) technology**\n\nIn addition to the advantages mentioned above, the global distribution of security tokens can be significantly simplified. \u201cWhen securities are tokenized, compliance can be automated, which means that regulated trade will no longer be restricted to walled gardens. Security tokens will be able to trade anywhere, including decentralized exchanges. Further, baking compliance into the token could help market participants navigate the [extremely complex](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201106/20110606ATT20781/20110606ATT20781EN.pdf) task of selling securities across borders\u201d10.\n\nThe **potential** **of** **securitization on the blockchain** is massive, which is why many exchanges and banks have started to build their own applications on private blockchains. The size of the opportunity becomes apparent when looking at the size of the market capitalization of listed companies worldwide, which recently reached USD79.2 trillion after considerable growth in the last 30 years as illustrated in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4:\n\n**Market capitalization of** **listed** **companies** **worldwide** **-1975-2017.11**\n\n(in USD)\n\nIn comparison, the crypto asset market capitalization represents only around 0.4% of today's equities market. As **tokenization of** **real-world** **assets** **takes** **off** and ICOs morph into the new form of IPO, the **digital** **asset** **market** **capitalization** **is** **set** **to grow** **exponentially**.\n\n# Challenges of tokenization\n\n# In a network that powers tokenized assets, consistency is key. The protocols underneath public blockchains enable the secure, immutable and consistently reliable execution of transactions and smart contracts. In dealing with real world assets represented by tokens new challenges arise.\n\nOne of them is ensuring consistency between the physical asset and its digital token12.\n\nThe tokenization of real-world assets is an ongoing challenge that requires innovative solutions. These solutions need to incorporate technology with new business processes - and in some cases\n\n\\- new legal forms. Clearly defined legal models need to be put into place to protect both the asset seller and the investor. To manage these challenges, the VALOR Platform incorporates additional auditing procedures. These procedures vary across different investment types.\n\nFor example, today the number of shares issued by a certain company is recorded in a public company registry in the country where the company is domiciled. As these entities move to a blockchain-based solution, the change of ownership will be directly registered in the public ledger without any time lag. The first implementation cases are already in progress today, such as a company registry in Switzerland13 and a real estate registry in Sweden14. As more and more centralized registries for all sorts of assets move on-chain in the coming years, consistency between tokens and their underlying assets will become less and less of an issue.\n\n[https://smartvalor.com/](https://smartvalor.com/)",

            "text": "There's no secret that privacy in cryptocurrencies these days is an important topic. As times has progressed and the need for privacy is on the rise; no company or individual would like to publish all their details in \u2018public\u2019 Blockchains that can be read arbitrarily by their own governments, foreign administrations, family members, coworkers or business competitors without limitation.\n\nBlockchain, the platform on which Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in its entirety was built on, has been the center of research and experiments on different privacy approaches. But these approaches are yet to be perfected, or have they?\nBitcoin was initially developed as a privacy-maintaining cryptocurrency so long as real world identities could not be linked to Bitcoin addresses. Because of the blockchain's public character, however, it became soon clear that certain addresses and transactions could be used in the identification of individuals. Moreover, whenever transactions are broadcasted, the nodes could leak IP addresses of the parties involved.\nAlso, persons that are dependent on exchange platforms like Coinbase are subject to their identities being revealed by these platforms. For example, IRS once demanded for the transaction of Coinbase by turning over certain data concerning crypto-currency transactions.\nIn response to the erosion of privacy on the blockchain technology platform, a lot of innovators sought to create privacy encoded cryptocurrencies that are geared towards privacy protection. So far, there have been a lot of projects as regards this but even amongst these projects; VEIL is one that stands out.\n\nVeil Project \n\nVeil project is a cryptocurrency project set up under the Zerocoin protocol. As is well known, Zerocoin blockchain technologies are different from the systems that we know. Zerocoin technology's main purpose is to ensure full confidentiality of the crypto transactions. The sender or receiver is therefore unknown and cannot be traced.\nThe project is a brainchild of James Burden and it was birthed the first quarter of 2018. James Burden as at the time of inception of Veil Project was not a new name in the cryptocurrency world as he had unrivalled records in founding and leading successful cryptocurrency projects. Some of the top characteristics that make the Veil project stand out among other privacy-oriented cryptocurrency projects include;\n\nBasic Advantages of the Veil Project \n\nWith the infrastructural build of the Veil system, it has succeeded in protecting the balance sheet of transactions; keeping all separate payment confidential and totally out of reach to third parties As a result of this, the speed of transactions is reduced, making it faster than even the fastest pseudo-anonymous cryptocurrency projects \u2013 e.g Ethereum.\nAlso, the veil project is built in such a way that the high-quality hashing methods are achieved, and a more efficient method of the mining and distribution of coins is also ensured. This, I believe is as a result of the increase in the reliability of the system infrastructure itself in distributing its coins among involved parties.\n\nConclusion \n\nIn a brief summary, the Veil project is without a doubt the solution to the problems of the security and dynamism of cryptocurrency and blockchain issues in relation to privacy. With the continuous analyses and implementation of users' experience, the Veil project will become one of the most advanced and active anonymous infrastructures in the cryptocurrency community that ever existed in the blockchain.\n\n[WEBSITE](https://veil-project.com/)\n[TELEGRAM](https://t.me/VEILProject)\n[DISCORD](https://discordapp.com/invite/Ywyb9hs)\n[ANN THREAD](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5065331.0)\n[FACEBOOK](https://www.facebook.com/projectveil/)\n[TWITTER](https://twitter.com/projectveil)\n[REDDIT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veil/)\n[GITHUB](https://github.com/Veil-Project)\n\nWriter's bitcointalk username : Leema\n[Writer](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1863050;sa=summary)\n\nBasecoin address: bv1q2h60xklca3qse6t0u06yt7g0pkur0tlqfyemt0",

For those of you who don\u2019t know me yet, let me introduce myself. My name is\u00a0**Eray**\u00a0and I\u2019m an experienced writer who enjoys what he does very much. I\u2019m here to give you all the information you might need or want about The future of social selling. I plan to make them \u201ceasy read, to the point\u201d because what\u2019s important to me is that we all comprehend and absorb the information and actually want to be here learning together about something new.\n\nToday, let us all learn and experience together all about\u00a0**Atomic Wallet**.\n\n***Atomic wallet*** is a multi-purpose, easy to use and highly secured cryptocurrency wallet supporting over 300 coins and tokens which is available for both mobile and PC version.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust as we all know that the cryptocurrency industry have gotten to a level where it can\u2019t be stopped any-longer, we should also remember that this technology is still being faced with the challenge of fiat to crypto exchange because several individuals that are interested in purchasing and investing in cryptocurrencies do not have a good platform to easily convert their local currencies to bitcoin or other crypto assets.\n\n>***We all might be wondering that since cryptocurrency technology is here to change all the existing world payment system, why then can\u2019t we do without fiat and fully integrate cryptocurrency into all sectors of the economy, this is largely because the blockchain technology is still at its very early phase so, we cannot totally do without fiat currencies for now****.*\n\n### What Does the Project Promise?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m6cj050dht131.png?width=1297&format=png&auto=webp&s=1131ea7c5191187db4b8967c22d07b3274e82a06\n\nIndeed the task is focused; to deal with our crypto cash resources dependably and to work through a progressively secure framework. So how is this going to be? A standout amongst the most critical issues that separates the **Atomic Wallet** venture from different activities is; rather than crypto trades on this stage, rather than keeping all crypto keys on the stock trades, they keep this data on clients\u2019 gadgets. The clarification is that; We are never again ready to take our private keys and we are exceptionally protected. This is a great improvement...\n\n### How does the framework work?\n\nOn this stage, a secret word screen is demonstrated which we can get to the wallet first. The 12-word simple to-utilize wallet passage seed will at that point enable you to get to your wallet with no mail affirmation or any outsider endorsement component, for example, google authenticator. Along these lines, clients can get to their **e-wallets** without giving any exceptional data, for example, telephone or mail. Clients won\u2019t be imperilled by their **wallets** and ventures regardless of whether they face undesirable circumstances, for example, mail hacking and telephone misfortune.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Atomic Wallet** clients will sign in with secret phrase when entering the framework. The most vital component that isolates this stage from different stages is the swap divide. In the Swap area, clients can perform shared swaps with **BTC, Ltc, Eos, Xlm and Neo.**\n\nA standout amongst the most loved pieces of the stage is; individuals can make their very own requests for the trade between digital currencies, and they can be incorporated into the change orders made by others, this is extremely extraordinary.\n\n### What are the exceptional features of this wallet\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ohf8qndht131.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=80e6ba1f3d4065f004788ff94c18e72eb417474c\n\n* *Ability to control your private keys by yourself only*\n* *Private and anonymous transactions which prevents you from being hacked*\n* *Easy to use built in cryptocurrency exchange*\n* *Excellent user interface*\n* *Always active customer support*\n* *Reliable security measures which ensures the safety of users\u2019 funds*\n* *Very cheap and affordable transaction fees*\n\n**Atomic wallet** team have recognised this cogent issue and as such, they have come up with the great solution of integrating Simplex which is the largest licensed card processing company in the European Union.\n\n**Atomic wallet** as we all know is a multi-feature wallet which affords its users the ability to store and manage 300+ cryptocurrencies, exchange their cryptocurrencies assets easily into other cryptocurrencies, monitor the current price of the supported cryptocurrencies among other features.\n\n**Atomic wallet** has also made another great step in ensuring a hassle free cryptocurrency assets management for all its users by making partnership with Simplex. Simplex only requires users to pass their verification just once after which they can continually use the service to purchase cryptocurrencies with their bank cards and get their cryptocurrencies sent to their wallet within the shortest possible period of time.*You will agree with me that this will go a long way in ensuring massive adoption of cryptocurrency which is the main of most crypto projects*.There are other exciting features of the atomic wallet which includes the ability of user to control their private keys locally which ensure maximum safety of users funds, cheap and affordable transaction fees, easy to use and convenient user interface, fast and easy to use in-built cryptocurrency exchange among several others.\n\n**Atomic wallet** application is convenient and easy to use and is also available for download for both **PC** and **mobile**.\n\nWhat are you still waiting for?

            "text": "The first generation of blockchain known as Bitcoin made cryptocurrencies possible. It also created a peer-to-peer system of transactions. The second generation of blockchain known as Ethereum made the use of smart contracts possible. \nThe limitations in this first and second generation of blockchain led to the creation of other blockchains, but yet cryptocurrency is yet to be adopted massively. These limitations are slow transaction confirmation, high fee etc.\n\nIn order to solve these issues thereby bringing cryptocurrencies to the masses, Ferrum Network tends to take a different path. That is, instead of building its own network, Ferrum Network aims to leverage the values of existing blockchains thereby connecting them to a high-speed transaction layer that enables peer-to-peer transactions of any digital asset.\n\n**Why Ferrum Network Is The Right Solution**\n\nFerrum Network is a platform utilizing cutting edge technologies so as to build a high-speed peer-to-peer platform where transactions of any digital asset are done efficiently.\n\nFerrum Network will be powered by the native utility token or FRM. With this token, each transaction will require a nominal of FRM to be spent and burned to attach proof to the transaction and as an anti-spamming \nmeasure. \n\nFerrum is the right solution because its product line includes a live fiat gateway and payments app called Kudi Exchange. Kudi Exchange is a fast, low-cost platform for buying and selling of digital currencies; it will be combined with a revolutionary peer-to-peer payments app allowing users to instantly send fiat currency with no intermediaries. \nAlso, Kudi Exchange owing to how it was built is the first fiat-to-crypto exchange in West Africa with access to a U.S. Dollar backed stable coin. \n\nWithin Ferrum is also a non-custodial crypto wallet called UniFyre Wallet. The importance of this is that it allows users to transact any digital asset with no counter-party risk. It also provides amazing capabilities such as risk-free OTC trading, instant market trades, and safety features to help users prevent accidental loss. \n\n**_In Conclusion;_** Ferrum Network is built to address the issues of slow transactions and high cost. This is achieved by leveraging existing blockchain networks thereby ensuring a peer-to-peer high-speed interoperability network etc.\n\n**Useful Links**\n\nWebsite: https://ferrum.network/\n\nWhitepaper: http://whitepaper.ferrum.network/\n\nBounty0x Username: Chuky",

Should the hard cap be hit before, the period will end at that moment. The goal of the ICO is to fund the first development stage, while allowing investors to get better ROI than just holding cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe KAAS token will be the only currency in which users will pay for the processing time to accomplish their tasks via the decentralized infrastructure. The initial token valuation is 1 KaaS = 1 EUR. The Minimum investment is 0.1 ETH or equivalent in the other accepted currencies; exchange rates are updated hourly. Maximum investment during ICO phase is 500 ETH or equivalent, per account. The accepted currencies are: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether, Ether Classic, Expanse and Ellaism. The total supply of tokens, during the ICO and before the KaaS blockchain launch, consists of 400000000 units. 100000000 tokens are available to investors, during the ICO phase. The funding soft-cap is set at 10M Euro, while the hard-cap is set at 100M Euro.\n\n",

To do that, BetBox has created a hedge fund that uses machine learning and deep neural networks to [make intelligent predictions](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/bitcoin-investment-trading-technical-indicators/).\n\nThe hedge fund\u2019s strategy is implemented by a large team of *BetBox* researchers. The fund ingests 1.6 million pieces of information daily, then runs that information through proprietary technology and algorithms.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the hedge fund is to provide capital growth by investing in sports betting markets through [algorithm-based trading](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/best-bitcoin-trading-bots/).\n\nTo help achieve that goal, BetBox is conducting an [ICO](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/initial-coin-offering/) over November and December.\n\nUltimately, BetBox aims to introduce AI-driven trading to a market that many people believe is unpredictable:\n\n\u201cBetting has always been pointed out as an unclear, obscure and unsecure market. That is correct if you perceive it from an emotional point of view: you bet on your dream team and you lose, but you will still continue to bet on your dream team. That is not rational, that\u2019s emotional. What if we changed your perspective and looked at this market in a functional way, as an [investment opportunity](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/bitcoin-hyip-high-yield-investment-plans/), a chance to diversify your income portfolio?\u201d\n\nBasically, BetBox believes there\u2019s an opportunity to use data to beat bookmakers in multiple sports worldwide.\n\n### How Does BetBox Work?\n\nBetBox combines fully automated and scalable AI technology with deep neural networks, machine learning, and a \u201cperforming infrastructure architecture.\u201d BetBox\u2019s data-driven approach was built with the goal of developing sophisticated trading models for the sports betting market.\n\nThat hedge fund analyzes 1.6 million pieces of information daily using algorithms and proprietary technology. These algorithms are designed to make predictions in sports betting markets.\n\nThe fund will not invest more than 10% of its assets under management (AUM) into each BetBox algo-trading model.\n\nThe fund also has an annual management fee of 3%, plus a performance fee of 30%. Performance fees are uncapped, so there\u2019s no maximum fee.\n\nThe [BetBox whitepaper outlines](https://betbox.ai/BetBoxTechWhitepaper.pdf) the optimal betting strategy that will be used by the platform. That strategy will be used to conduct automated betting across multiple sports worldwide.\n\nThe end result is a hedge fund built to achieve maximum profitability from a market that many had previously believed was unpredictable.\n\n### The BetBox ICO\n\nThe BetBox pre-ICO begins on November 9. All BetBox tokens (BETX) give you the right to receive 20% of the BetBox hedge fund\u2019s net transaction revenue.\n\n31.1% of the crowdsale tokens are being distributed during the pre-ICO. There\u2019s a hard cap of 7.8 million BETX for the pre-ICO, with a soft cap of 746,093 BETX. The price of the token will be 0.0034 ETH during he pre-ICO, with no minimum purchase amount required.\n\nThe pre-ICO is scheduled for November 9, 2017 to January 18, 2018.\n\nAnyone who purchases BETX tokens during the pre-sale will receive one \u201cGiftCoin\u201d for each BETX they purchase. Each GiftCoin allows investors to enter the BetBox platform any time for one entire day (24 hours) and see how they invest on European Top Players.\n\nMore Information\n\n [https://betbox.app/](https://betbox.app/) \n\nBount0x ID : hllelek33",

            "text": "In just one month since we released the Wibson app and launched the Wibson data marketplace, we\u2019ve already surpassed 5,000 data sellers. This is a very important milestone for Wibson and shows the tremendous interest individuals have in a secure and easy way to monetize their personal data. As our user base continues to grow, we will attract more Data Buyers, providing Wibson users more opportunities to profit from their data. We want to thank all of the Wibson data sellers who have supported this project and shared valuable feedback to help improve Wibson.\n\nHere are other updates for the week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Worldwide Events**\n\nNovember will be a busy month for the Wibson team. We are excited to participate in three major events in the next month. More than 6000 attendees are expected at [Tri TEC 2018](http://www.trimarchidg.net/trimarchi-18/tecnologia/) in Buenos Aires, Argentina, November 2\u20134. This is an important digital media event that focuses on disruptive technology, digital products and the creation of content in new formats. Rodrigo Irarrazaval of Wisbon will be presenting. The [Singapore Fintech Festival 2018](https://fintechfestival.sg/) is the world\u2019s largest platform for the global financial technology community and runs November 12\u201316, and Wibson CEO and Co-Founder, Mat Travizano, will be one of the keynote speakers. Finally, the [C20 Conference\u200a\u2014\u200aBitcoin + Blockchain](https://c20.io/index-english.html) in Buenos Aires, Argentina on November 16 and 17 is the most important crypto conference in the Spanish-speaking world. More than 3000 attendees and 50 speakers will be featured across two days of seminars, workshops, networking opportunities and Q&A sessions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Wibson Is Live in Uruguay**\n\nWibson has successfully launched in Uruguay! This is the fourth country where the Wibson marketplace is live, and the community there is growing rapidly. We plan to keep expanding Wibson\u2019s presence across the world as quickly as we can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to Use the Wibson App**\n\nWe created a new video that quickly and easily explains how the Wibson app and marketplace work. It\u2019s perfect for new Wibson users who are looking to get started. The video is available on the Wibson website and across Wibson\u2019s social channels. Please share your thoughts about it with us!\n\n[https://youtu.be/yQS6VJT0crc](https://youtu.be/yQS6VJT0crc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tim Cook Keynote**\n\nApple\u2019s CEO, Tim Cook, recently shared his views on personal data being weaponized during his keynote address at the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners that took place in Brussels during October 22\u201326. We were very happy to hear one of the tech industry\u2019s most powerful players support Wibson\u2019s views on the issues and opportunities associated with personal data.\n\n\u201cUsers should always know what data is being collected from them and what it\u2019s being collected for.\u201d\n\nWatch the the full speech:\n\n[https://youtu.be/kVhOLkIs20A](https://youtu.be/kVhOLkIs20A)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWs : [https://wibson.org/](https://wibson.org/)\n\nBounty0x Username : caylak135246\n\n&#x200B;",

The Catex platform is one of the most beautiful examples of cryptocurrency exchanges created in the blockchain area.\n\n90% of cryptocurrency exchanges are simple platforms with very similar infrastructures, almost mutually exclusive functions that basically allow you to buy and sell bitcoins and some Altcoins. Catex platform differs from competitors both in use and in work. If we consider the features of the Catex platform, isolated from other exchanges on the market;\n\n The Catex Stock Exchange initiated a conversion, which is returned to the user as a Catt coin with bonuses at certain rates when its users trade. Thus, 80% of the commissions apply to users who own a Catt coin, depending on what they do, or on what they hold Catt Coin. 7 - 15 - 30 and with 60-day periods, the Catt coin withholds or receives a bonus from the shares and the Catt coin from the income received on the Catex Stock Exchange. \n\n \n\nAll important decisions on the Catex Stock Exchange are made and evaluated according to comments from them, suggesting them to the existing community of users. Management Catex will be responsible only for important operations, marketing operations and some important management issues related to the platform. As can be seen, the Catex platform differs from many cryptocurrency exchanges both in management and in profit and use.\n\nOne of the most important methods of making money on the Catex stock market is the ability to make money through mining. So, how to make loot and what bets can I get? Mining has certain criteria. The most important thing is the speed of extraction. Mining speed is a value determined by the platform for physical control of the cost of production. This is a level of complexity that is similar to the complexity of inter-block digging, which we know from other coins that have been mined and is being rebuilt every day to maintain the stability of the miners' earnings. Once you log into your personal account on the Catex Stock Exchange, you can see your personal mine bet.\n\n \n\nFinally, every week the Catex Stock Exchange lists 2 tokens set by user voting for free. Unlike competitors in many ways, Catex also matters in the token list.  \nLooking at the Catex platform development team, we can say that the team consists of experienced people who can express themselves well. The people on this team showed their vision that they are broad and far-sighted people, with differences outlined in the work of the stock market. That is why they deserve commendable promises.\n\nFor investors who want to trade on the Catex stock exchange or invest in Catt coins, we can say that Catt sales are currently available on the Catex stock exchange. You can easily register on the stock market and invest. Thanks to the various functions that it provides, we can say that many users will be interested in the Catex stock market, which will facilitate investment life, and that its future is very bright. But these opinions are personal opinions that belong to me, and they simply bind me. I would like you to act on free will and not consider the information provided here as investment advice that will give you an accurate return.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.catex.io/](https://www.catex.io/)",

            "text": "Traditional crypto cryptocurrencies consensus such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin is achieved through a mechanism called Proof of Work (PoW), which requires blocks to prove that the nodes that produce blocks have completed a difficult task. This process of building consensus plays an important role in the security and authenticity of transactions, avoiding duplication of costs and fraud. Although this is the most widely used consensus mechanism, PoW reports several important issues, such as the large power consumption of mining equipment, expensive IT costs and the risk of attack by 51%. Because the computational power needed to perform cryptographic calculations increases with increasing difficulty, even greater amounts of electricity are consumed.\n\n\nIn the long run, this will be counterproductive to the health of the cryptocurrency miners because miners have to sell large amounts of their currency to pay electricity bills by devaluing crypto prices. In this way, it can be concluded that the PoW network is not financially ideal because only miners can receive premium blocks and transaction costs for valuable resources, while ordinary users do not recognize ROI by having coins. \"Stock certificate\" (POS) consensus. To check and add blockchain transactions, miners are selected if they have a large number of blockchain blocks or blocks used. This is considered a \"fairer\" system because anyone who has a currency can become a miner and can do more, help resolve blocks on the blockchain. You don't need to buy expensive computer systems for extraction.\n\n\nIn order for the system to continue and to reach a consensus mechanism for the NASGO network, NASGO also use a broad consensus mechanism called Delegated PoS (PoS), which consensus is reached through delegation and hacking. This is the backbone of the financial ecosystem of NASGO because it provides decentralized capabilities to validate transactional activities. It provides confidence in the activities of consumers from equal partners, such as NASGO products and services throughout the world, as well as third-party products in various fields. Transactions are validated in an energy-efficient manner with proof of coin ownership. DPOS means proof of delegated bets. Using a basic \"proof of betting\" system, but instead of the unit that has the largest currency with the largest \"mining performance\", anyone who has only one coin can have the ability to be a \"delegate\". chosen or rejected.\n\nNASGO is based on a consensus mechanism from DPoS (Delegated Proof of the Bet). This consensus method was originally created by the BitShares team. DPoS is based on delegates who make blocks. Delegates are trusted accounts chosen as \"active delegates.\" Block is made by 101 delegate accounts with the most votes. Other delegates are registered as \"standby delegates\" and can switch to list 101 by voting from other NASGO owners. All NASGO users have 101 votes to choose their favorite delegates in the top 101 list. The weight of each 101 votes is proportional to the number of NSGs a user has in the portfolio from which the vote is given. This total appears as \"permission\" in the delegation list and is expressed as a percentage of the 100 million NSGs available used to select this delegation.\n\nWebsite: https://nasgo.com/\n\nWhitepaper : https://nasgo.com/whitepaper/Nasgo_\n\nBountyox username : Bethmotel ",

Similarly, to inject new forms of revenues, fans or musicians are incentivized to take actions on the system, such as curating music content.\n\nThe smart music economy encourages both music creators and listeners to interconnect and share information of value \u2014 and creates new forms of compensation that can be way more important than solely streaming itself (for example, the traditional low pay of $0.006 to $0.0084 per stream to the holder of music rights on the streaming giant Spotify)",

            "text": "# Business Model\n\nVOLUM maximizes investment value and stability through its holding company structure. VOLUM invests in portfolio companies that currently possess, or have the ability to easily create, long-term asset value. This offers VOLUM investors diversification across multiple companies and industries. It is widely understood in the investor community that the mortality rate of any startup company, whether on or off the blockchain, is very high. News.Bitcoin.com conducted a study and found that forty six percent (46%) of all the ICOs launched in 2017 ended in failure either as a result of not raising enough money during the TGE or later as a result of not delivering a product.1  As a result, investors are attracted to holding companies which distribute the risk among multiple organizations. In its selection process for holding company investments, VOLUM seeks, identifies and vets the best-ofthe-best opportunities. It is not a requirement for an operating company candidate to be blockchain based, although it is preferred, especially when the VOLUM platform and VLMs can be leveraged. Primarily, VOLUM searches for companies with disruptive business models and compelling revenue models, favoring those that possess intellectual properties. VOLUM abides by an overarching strategy to combine synergistic companies in a portfolio that will benefit from one another, or from a common infrastructure and whenever possible, a single token for blockchain based operations.\n\nVOLUM has reached agreement for investment terms to take a minority stake in five (5) portfolio companies subsequent to completion of VOLUM TGE.\n\n**Software Developers Associates, Inc. (AirTab/NowVana)**\n\n\u2022 Spirits industry blockchain-based mobile/social marketing app\n\n**Energy Rescue Systems Corporation**\n\n\u2022 Blockchain-based smart city/advanced energy devices for commercial buildings.\n\n**Assets Credit Management and Equity Financial, LLC (ACME Financial)**\n\n\u2022 Captive financial company, provides equipment leases for customers of Energy Rescue, GridPower and other VOLUM companies. Puerto Rico registered international bank.\n\n**GridPower Network**\n\n\u2022 Domiciled in Puerto Rico, the company enjoys minority business enterprise (MBE) status\n\n\u2022 Holds worldwide exclusive license to resell Energy Rescue Systems products and services.\n\n\u2022 GridPower product GridPal is a subscription for cloud-based electricity monitoring services that provide users with energy optimization intelligence.\n\n\u2022 Competitive-energy reseller that purchases wholesale from incumbent electric utilities companies.\n\n**International Spirits and Beverage Group (ISBG)**\n\n\u2022 Producer and marketer of wines and spirits brands globally.\n\n# Revenue Model\n\nOnce an operating company within the VOLUM portfolio reaches a level of profitable operations, VOLUM will receive dividend income based upon VOLUM\u2019s pro rata ownership in the entity. Additionally, VOLUM operates the blockchain-based technology platform that its portfolio companies utilize for their respective operations. VOLUM will receive recurring transaction revenue and other ongoing licensing fees from each portfolio company that utilizes the platform. Over the holding period of VOLUM\u2019s investments in its portfolio companies, it is reasonable to expect that some of these investments will prove to be successful and some will not. As with any early-stage or venture capital investment strategy, a winning outcome will require that the value of the successful investments out-weigh the losses from the unsuccessful ones. As a result of the qualitative selection process it employs, it is expected that the value of the company\u2019s portfolio holdings will increase substantially over time and thus increase the enterprise value of VOLUM. Such an increase would benefit investors of the company\u2019s VLM tokens as the rising value of the company assets would reflect in the price of VLMs. VOLUM could also realize gains in its portfolio companies by selling those investment for cash or by trading them for other non-cash assets.\n\nDuring its early stages, VOLUM and most of its portfolio companies will be pre-revenue, or just commencing revenue generating operations. During this time, VOLUM will be reliant on fundraising through the sale of its VLM tokens via an initial private sale then an TGE sale over a 4-week period and ultimately followed by a security token offering (STO) several months later. Investors in the private sale and TGE will have first option to purchase during the private sale phase of the STO. The funds raised in these rounds will be used for the purpose of building its decentralized technology platform and for investments in the five (5) initial portfolio companies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VOLUM Webpage**\n\n [https://volum.io/](https://volum.io/) \n\n**VOLUM WP**\n\n [https://volum.io/assets/images/volum-whitepaper.pdf](https://volum.io/assets/images/volum-whitepaper.pdf) \n\n**bounty0x ID: hllelek33**",

The Javvy Solution  \novercomes the issue by providing a clear, fully-scalable path to buying and selling  \ncryptocurrency easily, eliminating the need for massive cryptocurrency reserves.   \n    \n    \n  \n\n![img](zn9tscv4k4o21 \"Figure 2 -  Overview of Automated FIAT-to-CRYPTO EXCHANGE Process \n  \")\n\n  ***FIAT-to-CRYPTO EXCHANGE Process***  \n\u2022 User places an order to exchange crypto and FIAT (national currency)  \n\u2022 Peer nodes validate the transaction via network confirmations  \n\u2022 If Javvy received a sell order, we check the OFAC list for the transaction details  \n\u2022 If a match is found, the system cancels the order and flags the account for review  \n\u2022 Otherwise, peer nodes periodically check for sufficient blockchain confirmations  \n\u2022 If confirmed, initiate wire transfer to user  \n\u2022 Otherwise, the order will eventually be cleared from the order book  \n\u2022 If Javvy received a buy order, we check a crypto OFAC for the wallet address  \n\u2022 If a match is found, the system cancels the order and flags the account for review  \n\u2022 Otherwise, we periodically check for bank notification that funds have cleared  \n\u2022 If the funds clear, with associated memo details, crypto transfer is initiated  \n\u2022 Otherwise, the order will eventually be cleared from the order book \n\n  ***Overview of Cross-Currency Exchange***  \nJavvy received a patent pending (#62558597) for a provisional patent that covers  \nthe process and methodology for conversion and settlement of cryptocurrency  \npurchases, using an intermediary layer, the Javvy token (JVY), for the purpose of  \neliminating the need for holding disparate, volatile cryptocurrency reserves. This  \nis a drastic improvement over current crypto exchanges that merely offer one  \n(1) or two (2) cryptocurrencies (typically, bitcoin and Ethereum) to their users,  \ndue to the reserve limitation and extreme value risk. In contrast, by using this  \nintermediary interchange process, Javvy will instantly be positioned to support  \nnearly every major cryptocurrency in existence. Javvy users will be able to buy, sell,  \nuse, and manage them all, with the underlying framework remaining transparent  \nfrom a user perspective.   \n    \n  \n\n![img](tckcyxfek4o21 \"Figure 3 - Overview of Cross-Currency Exchange \n  \")\n\n  ***Details of the Intermediary Layer Interchange Process***  \nfor Handling Crypto or TOKEN Fulfillment  \n\u2022 User places an order to buy or sell cryptocurrency  \n\u2022 When possible, orders will default to fulfillment through conversion of the JAVVY token  \n(JVY), negating the need for Javvy to store massive crypto reserves  \n\u2022 If possible, perform fullfilment trade from existing token liquidity  \n\u2022 Otherwise, perform marketplace crypto/token trade to fulfill order  \n\u2022 Complete user order for desired crypto/token (Figure 2)  \n  ***Liquidity Explained***  \nWhen a buy/sell order is placed, the Javvy wallet will securely connect to Javvy\u2019s  \nservers to nearly instantly poll all open order books, arbitraging prices across  \ndecentralized exchanges and partner centralized exchanges that support 3rdparty orders via an open API.  \nUnless all crypto exchanges fail, Javvy will not provide its own centralized exchange  \ncomponent, as we believe that markets can be, and should be, decentralized.  \nThere are already several quality decentralized exchange projects and others  \nthat are working to provide liquidity and custodial services. So, Javvy supports  \nthose movements and will work with them to offer the best-in-class services to  \nits users.  \nWhile cryptocurrency liquidity is being ramped up in the markets, we will work with  \ntrusted liquidity providers to help place orders that cannot be filled elsewhere.   \n  \n\n \n\n[https://javvy.com/?v=ebe021079e5a](https://javvy.com/?v=ebe021079e5a)\n\n[https://javvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/javvy\\_crypto-solution-white-paper.pdf](https://javvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/javvy_crypto-solution-white-paper.pdf)\n\nBounty0x ID: hllelek33",

Financial volatility as seen through 2017\u20132018 and the increased media attention over Bitcoin have attracted many new investors, most of which have little or no prior experience with blockchain technology. Coinbase reportedly signed up 50,000 new users per day in 2017 and while many may not interact with these wallets, there is no denying the demand for these crypto based wallets is rising at an exponential rate. \n\n \n\nAs with all emerging technology, to attract and retain customers the tech needs to be functional, easy to navigate, and provide consumers with confidence. These points are even more important in a market which is completely alien to a large number of their potential users. Once an investment has been made, having a secure medium to store, trade, and withdraw these assets is a necessity. Every investor values the security of their assets especially in lieu of past security failures where many have lost all or part of their investments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Javvy](https://preview.redd.it/w2gfeiz6rgc21.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=c241880d14e7a9cdfda7e0f18a54f21761c70673)\n\nThere are, of course companies who offer these services, all unique in their own way. To this note, it is the companies who have a solid grasp of the tech required and their client\u2019s user expectations that will be amongst those who succeed.\n\nEnter Javvy (JVY), an all-in-one crypto experience which includes a universal wallet with a built-in decentralized exchange. The Javvy founders Frank Grogan and Brandon Elliott have already created their minimum viable product (MVP), launched their initial coin offering (ICO), and will soon be moving forward with their exhaustive roadmap.\n\nThe team has created the JVY wallet which allows for quick & easy registration, has a superior user experience, and includes numerous advanced security features. The Javvy solution also includes a decentralized exchange and the native JVY coin.\n\n[https://javvy.com/](https://javvy.com/)",

This is a drastic improvement over current crypto exchanges that merely offer one (1) or two (2) cryptocurrencies (typically, bitcoin and Ethereum) to their users, due to the reserve limitation and extreme value risk. In contrast, by using this intermediary interchange process, Javvy will instantly be positioned to support nearly every major cryptocurrency in existence.

But progress does not stand still: payment cards are being replaced 5\nby mobile applications installed in smart phones, and good old fiat money gives way to cryptocurrencies. The latter is \ndue to a combination of various factors, including the natural human desire not to feel \u2018\u2019closely watched\u2019\u2019, to preserve at \nleast partly the anonymity of their financial transactions: de jure, it is a constitutional right of every citizen, de facto the \ncase is different. \nThe dizzying growth of the bitcoin exchange rate was one of the reasons for the cryptocurrency boom in 2017. Ironically, \nit is because of this that the share of bitcoin in the total market capitalization has rapidly decreased \u2013 from more than \n80% in June 2016 to less than 40% in December 2017: hundreds of new coins and tokens appeared, and some of them \nmanaged to win a place under the sun. \nThis being said, using the same bitcoin's case a curious fact can be stated: the number of transactions with its use is \nconstantly growing and in 2017 exceeded 100 million, but at the same time, this very impressive figure is still very far \nbehind the indicators of fiat payment systems (PayPal \u2013 about 6 billion transactions, direct bank payments just in \nGermany \u2013 more than 10 billion, VISA \u2013 141 billion according to 2016). \nThis leads to the logical conclusion: the crypto-currency market has a huge, almost inexhaustible potential for further \ngrowth, and the project that will be the first to be able to offer its customers a \"turnkey\" working system that provides not \nonly standard opportunities typical for the usual fiat Internet banking, but also significantly expanding their list, will \ncertainly be \u2018\u2019on the crest of the wave\u2019\u2019 and will interest potential investors with a combination of prospects for obtaining \nconsiderable income in a relatively short time with the obvious reliability and durability of its business model. This is \nconfirmed, among other things, by the amount of levies of those token sale projects that tried to set themselves similar 6\ntasks: Cryptopay \u2013 51 million dollars, Crypterium \u2013 18 million, ChangeBank \u2013 17.5. Though, none of these projects is a \ncryptobank in the full sense of the word: services such as depositing and transferring money from one's account to \nanother, traditionally provided by the banking sector, have not yet been brought to the implementation stage. \nNot far off is the moment when any cryptocurrency asset will become a universal means of payment, which will be able \nto pay for anything \u2013 from a cup of coffee to a new apartment. Those who bring this moment closer, already today \nrealizing what others will only think about tomorrow, will undoubtedly benefit. \nThe PointPay Team strives to be one step ahead of competitors and intends to create a bank of the future. https://pointpay.io",

Payments should be virtually free to users, to reach widespread adoption. \n\n**\u2022 Irreversibility (low confirmation time).** \n\nBitcoin payment can take an hour to get confirmed (6 blocks of ca. 10 minutes of mining for each) and a couple of minutes for ethereum, and no user would like to keep waiting until such confirmation times lapse. This would need to be virtually instant i.e. of low latency. \n\n**\u2022 Decentralized control, transparency and flexible trust.** \n\nUsers must be able to choose any number of parties they see fit, which means that any user should be of equal importance. \n\n**\u2022 Safety and security.** The security should not only rest on \u201cnormal\u201d digital signatures and hash families but eventually on such ones that can be set to protect against hostile parties with even unimaginably vast computing power that may be in the future amplified by quantum computing.\n\n **\u2022 Easy, convenient and intuitive user interfaces.** User interfaces of the services \u2013 the wallet, exchange and any network \u2018gateway interface\u2019 such as a bank or broker - must be simple and easy to use, intuitively facilitating buy, sell, store and transfer of value and use of any available app. \n\n**\u2022 Vast, engaged user base and community.** A true community must be created and evolve, driven by the passion of its creators.  \n\n**Argentas project is investing all their effort to solve mentioned above problems creating 2nd generation blockchain project.**",

This is achieved by deriving a new one-time public key as the destination for every transaction using the receivers address and random data generated by the sender.\n\nThis makes it impossible to link any output (the one-time public key) back to the receiving address, allowing users to have a static receiving address linked to their name, without revealing their transactions.",

This is known as your risk tolerance.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bIf you decide to begin exponentially growing your business, you will need risk tolerant capital. It could be $400\u2013800 for smaller capital accounts and $1000\u20132000 larger capital accounts.\n\u200b\u200bFor exceptional returns, speculators could allocate a risk-tolerant capital investment of $2000\u20134000.\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\u200b\u200bMost Network Effect participants should accumulate 1000 $PART position\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is the \u201cPlatinum\u201d standard for $PART STAKING (dividend like returns). As the Network Effect strengthens over time, the value of your holdings and also your interest rewards by staking will grow exponentially!\n\n\nParticl Privacy Platform has a real use-case. It\u2019s a decentralized, private-by-default, eCommerce application that has huge potential for mass adoption. 99% of all other digital assets (cryptocurrencies) DO NOT have anything similar. Most have only a speculative-currency use-case, which is already fulfilled by BITCOIN.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bMany Bitcoin holders will eventually end up accumulating PARTICL ($PART), due to its unique  global private decentralised eCommerce value proposition. What makes Particl second to Bitcoin is its supply which is also considered SCARCE. At the same time Particl is better than Bitcoin as Particl is Privacy and Anonymity oriented DECOM platform for Private Dapps. It\u2019s a Big Bang in the cooking! \n\n\nCurrently Less than 10,000 people on our planet of 7+ billion, could ever HOLD a 1,000 $PART position, since the current Particl supply is less than 10,000,000 PART.\n\n\n\u200b\u200b\u201cPARTICL is all BITCOIN ever wanted to be. BITCOIN is all PARTICL ever wanted to be.\u201c - Particl is Satoshi Nakamoto dream come true \n\n\n\u200b\u200bHypothetical Trade to Make: Buy Particl (PART)\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bAccumulation Price: any price up to ~$47 per 1PART is considered a \u201cdiscount\u201d price. \n\n\nAccumulate (buy slowly, scaling in), stake it and earn passive income on your position. AND REMEMBER, the $Part amount that you stake compound will grow exponentially too!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bStop Loss: consider placing SL at 1.2x- 2x profit of your average accumulation price and up.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bBuy It On: Bittrex, Chainex or other exchanges where PARTICL $PART is available. \n\n\nLarger risk-tolerant accounts seeking a position should explore OTC options.\n\n\n\u200b\u200bStore It On: Particl Desktop or other wallets.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bImportant note: do not buy into the sell wall. Instead, setup a buy order on the buy side of the order book and wait until someone sells $PART to you. Buy slowly, sell slowly.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bSupport the decentralized Particl network by staking for passive income - compound. There is no minimum so you can stake whatever amount you have accumulated and are comfortable with. (Utilize the network\u2019s SECURITY, PRIVACY & Anonymity; PROSPERITY to ensure your safety.)\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bTo receive a constant stream of staking rewards, the recommended amount is 1000 $PART. A 1000 PART position would generate an approximate ~4% annual staking reward. That\u2019s a monthly earning of 4 PART. The secret is compounding. \n\u200b\u200b \n\n\u200b\u200bAlso remember, helping to grow the Particl Privacy Platform \u201cnetwork effect\u201d and eCommerce activity will generate additional staking rewards from minimal fees paid out by increasing participants. The Big Bang of world trade without third parties! \n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bWhen will the Particl network\u2019s value begin exponential growth? \n\n\nWith 100X exponential growth, 1 PART could be valued $100 USD. So a position of 1000 PART could generate a passive income of $400 a month. If $PART value experiences an additional 10X growth from there to $1000 per 1 PART, that would equate a passive income of $4000 in STAKING REWARDS EACH MONTH! \n\n\nOf course you could scale out (slowly SELL position) over time taking profits whenever you need, want or EXIT your position completely. It is important to always consider taking some profits along the way, as a risk management strategy. At that point, it\u2019d be up to you to decide what to do with your new-found wealth!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bIs it worth it to take the risk?\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bDuring the BULL market, when cryptocurrency valuations were rising due only to absolute Greater Fool speculation, $PART value spiked to ~$47 USD, without any real world use. But after years of development, Particl has wisely positioned itself for the cryptocurrency BULL RUN (exponential price increase). \n\n\nParticl has a real, working product , with a quality and utility NEVER SEEN before in the Bitcoin or Cryptocurrency space!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bHypothetical speculation puts Particl\u2019s exponential market capitalization growth at $10,000,000,000 billion USD and over as it\u2019s Satoshi Nakamoto dream coming true!\n\n\nThe value of 1 PART could spike beyond $1000 USD. That means if you had accumulated a 1000 PART position, your $Part value would experience growth to $1,000,000 USD! Not a bad risk vs return, speculative hypothesis for a $1\u20132 thousand investment.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bIf this seems unbelievable, then consider a return of 2000+% ,once $PART gets back to previous highs of $40-$50 range. If your average position entry price is $2, then that\u2019s an exponential wealth generation of ~23.5X\u200a\u2014\u200a34X. So your 1000 $PART position would grow to ~$40,000 -$50,000 wealth.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bCryptocurrency digital-asset markets move very fast. Today it\u2019s a depressing BEAR market- tomorrow it\u2019s a euphoria-filled BULL market. In green we trust! \n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bParticl\u2019s Fundamental Technological value, should be ~$899 USD NOW!!! As its technological innovation is worthy of a position in cryptocurrency\u2019s TOP 10 market cap, RIGHT NOW, AT THIS VERY MOMENT!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bLet\u2019s compare PARTICL with LITECOIN, currently ranked in the TOP 8th place with $8.74 billion market capitalization.\n\n\nLitecoin has only one only speculative use case- a currency, which is a little faster than BITCOIN transactions. LOL. \u201cMuch speed\u201d the Bitcoin \u201cSilver\u201d. LOL. A meme to the moon. \n\u200b\u200b\n\u200b\u200b\nLitecoin $8.74 billion USD market-cap is only justified by its NETWORK EFFECT (amount of trader speculators, holders, exchanges). So while you can still experience wealth growth with Litecoin, it\u2019s already in the TOP 8 coinmarketcap position, which drastically limits its upside wealth-building potential. It\u2019s only a boring high risk speculative digital currency with no privacy, anonymity or dapps... \n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bNow we understand what enormous value is hiding within the PARTICL PRIVACY PLATFORM, currently hovering around a $6 million marketcap.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bOnce PARTICL reaches LITECOIN\u2019s marketcap of $8.74 Billion, 1 PART will be valued at the equivalent of $899 USD.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bIn Conclusion \n\u200b\u200b\n\u200b\u200b\nParticl offers a Steve Jobs Apple grade mainstream use case, designed to create utility for the underlying $PART digital asset - Decom (decentralised commerce). \n\n\nThis increasing demand will add to Particl\u2019s network effect. As Particl becomes more popular, the platform is poised to grow into a TOP 10 contender within Crypto Industry. \n\n\nThe only question is, are you going to get involved today in strengthening the Particl Platform and securing YOUR financial future?\n\n\nThere are over 2000 digital assets with different Fundamental and Technical value propositions. \n\n\nParticl digital asset offer the BEST Risk/Reward Ratio and the best potential for exponential growth based on respective fundamentals.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bParticl has one of the best FUNDAMENTAL and TECHNICAL offerings in the digital-asset market. It\u2019s private by default Decentralised Dapp platform with first Private Marketplace dapp for global e-commerce trade without third parties. It works right now! And this creates a property designed to increase cash flow. \n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bCash flow is the money that is moving (flowing) in and out of the Particl Privacy Platform and its decentralized applications from Wealth Producing Activities. It is essentially a platform for global business, built into a permission-less and private format without third parties. This increase security, prosperity and wealth of all participants in the network.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bAll around our beautiful planet, businesses will be more than eager to accumulate $PART and use the Particl Privacy Platform e-commerce capacity for every day private and secure trade. Using Particl to gain a competitive advantage will become a natural, intellectual conclusion. As voluntary, permission-less participation grows within the community-driven network effect, so does direct wealth for businesses, customers, governments and every other participant in the OPEN network.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bUtility, and demand, for the PARTICL NETWORK are multi-dimensional. A GLOBAL NETWORK of businesses will emerge seeking to secure privacy, boost revenues and minimize transaction costs by accepting Particl\u2019s underlying cryptocurrency: $PART.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bValue in any system is explained by network effects. Because of this, exponential growth in Particl is rational.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bScarcity is real. Scarcity is a contributing factor in the value increase of many traditional economic systems. The supply of Particl is fixed by a Proof of Stake protocol that cannot be changed.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bDemand, and utility, are multi-dimensional. Particl is much more than a financial asset like a stock or bond. It has the combined qualities of a share (like a security), a currency (like the US dollar), a payment network (like Paypal), and an eCommerce platform (like eBay, Amazon or Alibaba). BUT unlike any of these characteristics, Particl is also PRIVATE, GLOBAL, SECURE and DECENTRALIZED (no single point of failure). In other words, it is better described as a technological innovation that is disrupting how global commerce is conducted.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bThe digital asset market of cryptocurrencies has experienced several bubbles, but has also established a trend of positive growth over many years. Many more bubbles will form while new BULL markets (buying) and BEAR markets (selling) continue to cycle. Despite the volatility, when compared to more established financial markets, the crypto markets are very undervalued.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bParticl is the most INNOVATIVE digital asset the world has ever seen!\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bNETWORK EFFECT\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bNetwork Effect is a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value of a good or service. The Internet is an example. Initially, there were very few users of the Internet. It was of relatively little value to anyone outside of the military and some research scientists.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bBut, as more users gained access to the Internet, more content, information, and services were built into the system. More user-friendly websites were developed, and more users connected to communicate with each other. By making the Internet increasingly valuable to its users, these developments enhanced Network Effect.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bThe NETWORK EFFECT of Particl as follows:\n\u200b\u200b\n\nBusiness Adoption\u200a\u2014\u200abusinesses will increasingly use Particl Open Marketplace because they can increase their profit margins by staking their $PART capital, avoiding eCommerce platform fees (amazon, eBay, etc.), credit card fees, charge-backs, privacy breach, data collection etc.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bConsumer Adoption\u200a\u2014\u200aconsumers can use Particl Open Marketplace to save money, simply by purchasing certain products on private-by-default Markets. Additionally, consumers can purchase items with $PART that they cannot buy (easily) in any other way. Consider: An American can buy Persian rugs or Cuban cigars despite trade embargoes.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bFinancialization\u200a\u2014\u200aParticl will eat up progressively more of the market share of legacy centralized eCommerce platforms, money transmitter companies, etc.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bSecurity\u200a\u2014\u200amerchant, consumer, and speculator adoption lead to a higher price and thus incentivize more participants to stake (a Passive Income similar to dividends). This in turn makes the Particl network even more robust. The decentralized, immutable transaction ledger also serves as a form of Triple Entry Bookkeeping, wherein Debits plus Credits plus the Network Confirmations of transactions increase trust and security across the system.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bDeveloper Mindshare\u200a\u2014\u200aParticl is a predictable network with simple rules and a publicly-auditable codebase. It is fertile ground for the development of complicated privacy and financial tools. Its decentralized nature allows for innovation without permission. Particl\u2019s store-of-value characteristics will increase- as its utility as a medium of exchange on its Private Marketplaces also increases.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bAdoption as a Currency\u200a\u2014\u200agrowth of Particl\u2019s user base (organizations, businesses, individuals) will accelerate further increases in Particl\u2019s price. Finally, a speculative rush could dramatically boost the value of Particl, almost overnight, by 10x or more.\n\u200b\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bAdoption of Passive income\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Particl Platform uses Particl Proof-of-Stake, its own native PoS protocol massively improving upon PoS3. Features added by Particl devs include: cold staking, quantum-resistance, voting and more. Stakers, the Particl equivalent of miners, can earn 4% yearly staking interest (dividend-like) in exchange for securing the network with their $PART cryptocurrency. On top of these staking rewards, stakers earn ALL fees and revenue generated by the platform (marketplace, decentralized applications, transactions, messaging, etc.) which means staking becomes increasingly profitable as more people participate in the Particl economy. Other ways to earn money on the Particl Privacy Platform include setting up a SHOP on the Particl Open Marketplace or using any other Particl Privacy Platform decentralized application on which revenue can be generated.\n\u200b\u200b\n\nEvery Crypto enthusiast a real high risk/return investors and speculators should recognise Particl as opportunity to become a real millionaire by investing only $1000.\n\n\nAll top 20 cryptocurrencies are over billion market cap. Mostly driven by memes and very high risk/ return speculation.\n\n\nPARTICL IS INVENTING ITS OWN UNIQUE CRYPTO INDUSTRY MARKET SEGMENT - DECOM - decentralised commerce",

Bitcoin creator,\u00a0[Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto#:~:text=Satoshi%20Nakamoto%20is%20the%20name,devised%20the%20first%20blockchain%20database.), is still a mystery figure. Satoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the person who designed bitcoin but there\u2019s still doubt about the real identity. Over the years, many people have been linked with the same, including Nick Szabo, Dorian Nakamoto, Hal Finney, Craig Steven Wright, and others. Some people consider Nakamoto might be a team of people. As of May 2017, Nakamoto is believed to own about 1 million bitcoins with a worth of more than $2 billion.\n2. Bitcoins are limited in number. You might\u2019ve heard about bitcoin mining, the process using which bitcoins are generated digitally. So, does this mean there could be an infinite number of bitcoins? That\u2019s not the case. A pre-defined schedule has limited the number of bitcoins. They are slowly approaching a total of 21 million and the mining process is getting harder with each passing day.\n3. It\u2019s impossible to know the sender/receiver details. Bitcoin addresses are a long string of 34 alphanumeric characters. Using that address, it\u2019s impossible to tell the recipient. Probably, this is the reason why most of the illegal transactions are carried out using bitcoins. To protect privacy even further, most wallet programs assign the users a portfolio ID, which is also used as a username.\n4. Pizza was the first thing (good) purchased using bitcoin after the first bitcoin transaction took place between Satoshi and Hal Finney in 2009, the first recorded purchase was made for buying pizza worth $25. To do so, 10,000 bitcoins were spent.\n5. Bitcoin network is much powerful than supercomputers according to the experts, Bitcoin networks has a computing power of\u00a02,046,364 Pflop/s. This is my personal favorite fact about bitcoin. If you go ahead and combine the computing power of the 500 most powerful supercomputers, you\u2019ll get a combined fever of 274 Pflop/s.\n6. Bitcoin has been sent into\u00a0[outer space](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.coindesk.com/a-bitcoin-wallet-is-orbiting-the-earth-at-five-miles-per-second%3famp=1). In 2016, Genesis Mining, a bitcoin cloud mining provider, set bitcoin to space. This was done using a 3D bitcoin model and a bitcoin paper wallet, which were tied to a weather balloon. The whole journey was recorded using a GoPro focused on the model and wallet. Once the weather balloon reached a height of 20 kilometers, the ground team made the transaction to a paper wallet.

Bitcoin is highly volatile. Since its launch, in past, one-decade bitcoin has become one of the most important phenomenon in the digital world. Its price has touched thousands of dollars. However, the price keeps fluctuating and it remains volatile. Predictions have also been made that bitcoin might fall in the future if it follows the current path. This is because a small number of people, about 10, control the majority of bitcoin. This defeats the entire\u00a0decentralized nature of the currency.",

There has also been a rise in the development and introduction of decentralized finance assets to this day. Before we dive deep into the top ten DeFi projects, we must first know their definition and essence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDeFi systems are projects with respective cryptocurrency representatives with one goal in mind: to decentralize and disrupt financial institutions like banks and other physical financial storage/s. DeFi projects are tasked with the introduction and development of modern-day cryptocurrency trading platforms. This in turn allows a wide variety of digital investment opportunities, breaking the limitations created by banks and other fundamental financial schemes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDeFi projects are expected to rise and increase their engagement with modern-day financial trading. Provided below are the top ten (10) DeFi projects to keep an eye on:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**10. Stakenet \u2013** Stakenet is an autonomous and future-proof platform that combines the Lightning network and Masternode into a global blockchain for decentralized applications. The Lightning Network is a second-layer solution that enables peer-to-peer off-chain transactions within a blockchain or between and among different blockchains. A Masternode on the other hand is a dedicated full node of a blockchain that resides around the world.  The Stakenet project has furnished its Masternodes to be Lightning network ready. This design allows Stakenet users to experience the instant and virtually feeless transactions of cryptocurrency. Currently, the Stakenet wallet, Stakenet's non-custodial multi-currency light wallet that features Stakenet DEX is currently in beta testing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9. Serum \u2013** a decentralized exchange (DEX) that provides speedy and low-cost transactions towards its users. Serum utilizes on-chain order books with an interface familiar to that of centralized exchanges. This allows its users to endorse their orders with directions, giving them full control over their assets. It is also noteworthy to mention Serum's program of giving its users the ability to trade custom cryptocurrency contracts, permitting them to assume positions on any product that Serum has to offer, even including cross-chain physically settled contracts which can also be tokenized for the blockchain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**8. UMA \u2013** is an open-source infrastructure that aims to deploy and enforce synthetic assets on the Ethereum blockchain. UMA provides its users the capacity to engage in priceless financial contracts. These contracts do not require an on-chain price feed to work and are designed to incentivize counterparties to properly collateralized their positions without any on-chain price feed. As the UMA community defines, their synthetic tokens are assets whose value changes over time depending on their tokens' reference index. By utilizing these priceless financial contracts, developers on UMA can secure and create synthetic tokens, directly benefitting UMA's token sponsors. To date, UMA has a total of sixty-three (63) million value locked in contracts, with a corresponding amount of twenty-one (21) million total value of synthetic tokens dedicated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7. Divi \u2013** the Divi project has presented itself and offered the solution to introduce the use of crypto in today's world. To achieve its goal, it has made its move to establish the Divi wallet. This user-friendly smart wallet brings up promising features of multi-coin system trading, even including fiat. The Divi wallet also has its lottery blocks program that weekly draws and announces Divi coin winners from its participants. The Divi clients can also earn more of its coins by running and maintaining Divi-powered masternodes. The Divi project will soon launch its Divi card, a Visa/Mastercard debit card which can be funded by the user's crypto balances on their Divi Wallet. This revolutionary strategy will allow the widespread introduction and use of crypto in day-to-day financial transactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6. Compound \u2013** is an algorithmic and autonomous DeFi project under the Ethereum blockchain that enables its stakeholders to borrow and lend a certain amount of cryptocurrencies. These include Dai (DAI) Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), among others. Users who store their financial holdings with Compound also gain the benefit of financial interest towards their accounts, depending on the type of cryptocurrency they used in making negotiations. To this day, the Compound DeFi has more than eight (8) million dollars worth of assets locked upon its asset earning across nine (9) different projects. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. Blocknet \u2013** a decentralized network that connects blockchains, whether through cross-chain Dapps or even using the protocol as a second layer to extend the blockchain functionality, Blocknet provides its developers the authority to establish applications that will secure digital transactions. Blocknet offers its lightweight and multi-asset wallet called the XLite. With the use of XLite, Blocknet's stakeholders can manage to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrencies. Connecting the XLite wallet to Blocknet's Block DX will allow greater trading opportunities for its users, reducing any unnecessary consumption of time and effort in navigating to other trading platforms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Uniswap \u2013** Uniswap has two (2) versions, with version one as an on-chain system of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that implements an automated liquidity protocol based on constant product formula. Version two offers a new implementation based on the same formula, with several highly remarkable features. Uniswap is a fully decentralized, open-source exchange platform that provides incentivized liquidity pools. This incentivizing system is directed towards people trading on the exchange to become liquidity providers. Uniswap users pool their money together to create a fund that is used to execute all trades that take place on the system. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Binance \u2013** one of the most well-known cryptocurrency exchange platforms in this day and age, with an average daily trading volume of over two (2) billion USD and processes more than one point four (1.4) million transactions per second, the Binance application offers trading of many different cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Polkadot, Cardano, and many more. Binance is known for having insurance protection for its crypto traders, accompanied by its multi-level security features to avoid any loss of investments. Binance also supports margin trading, where users who have the courage to stake greater risks for greater profits are welcome. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Polkadot \u2013** a flagship project by Web3 Foundation, a Swiss Foundation founded to facilitate a fully functional and user-friendly decentralized web. Polkadot's mission is to connect private and consortium chains, public and permissionless networks, oracles, and future technologies yet to be created. Furthermore, Polkadot enables the cross-chain transfer of any type of data or asset not limited to tokens. To date, Polkadot has climbed up the ranks of the cryptocurrency market, as an alternative crypto coin that has gained a two hundred fifty-five percent (255%) increase in performance compared to the sixty-seven percent (67%) of Bitcoin. A Dubai-based FD7 Ventures recently announced its plan to sell seven hundred fifty million (750,000,000.00) dollar worth of its Bitcoin holdings over the next month in Cardano and Polkadot blockchain. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. Cardano \u2013** defined as a blockchain platform for changemakers, innovators, and visionaries alike, offering the technology required to establish unparalleled security and credibility to decentralized applications. Cardano is the first blockchain platform that was built through peer-reviewed research that secures enough information to proceed with processing billions of data. Cardano features the Ouroboros, the first peer-reviewed, verifiably secured blockchain protocol. Ouroboros is responsible for maintaining Cardano's decentralized and sustainable network, allowing it to run seamlessly. Alongside Polkadot, a big number of investors have set their eyes on staking their assets in Cardano. Its cryptocurrency, ADA, has reached its all-time high value of one point thirty (1.30) dollars per coin. This development has turned Cardano to become one of the largest cryptocurrency platforms with a measured market capitalization of around thirty-nine (39) billion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The future of the crypto ecosystem is and will always be uncertain.* We shall be prepared to receive groundbreaking news, whether good or bad. We shall also expect an increase in the number of other different blockchain companies together with their respective crypto-powered projects, given the fact that the cryptocurrency has proven itself as an indestructible investment that can change the financial capacity of its rightful owner/s.",

According to the exchange platform, it will add users on a first-come, first-served basis, with plans to add everyone in the \"coming weeks.\"\n\nThe peer-to-peer marketplace has launched with support for [development of NFTs](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) forged on Ethereum, the leading platform for NFT artwork and collectibles, and Coinbase says it plans to add support for other unspecified blockchain platforms in the near future.\n\nCoinbase NFTs will aggregate listings from all markets, with a representative telling *Decrypt* that \u201cany NFTs that are for sale on the Ethereum blockchain will be searchable\u201d on the platform.\n\nThe Coinbase platform will debut without added transaction fees, though it will still have standard Ethereum gas fees. The market will eventually introduce its own fee, which Coinbase VP of Product Sanchan Saxena described in a media briefing as a \u201clow single-digit fee.\u201d\n\nAt launch, Coinbase NFT can only be used with self-custody wallets such as Coinbase Wallet and MetaMask , as well as wallets that support the WalletConnect protocol. This means that users are fully responsible for their own assets within a wallet, which can be connected to other markets, exchanges, and decentralized applications .\n\nHowever, Coinbase [NFT](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) plans to launch optional NFT custody services and allow users to purchase NFTs with a Coinbase account or credit card. Saxena described that planned move as part of an effort to \"bring NFTs to the masses through this platform.\"\n\nCoinbase NFT focuses on more than just buying and selling NFTs. It is presented as a community experience, with social feeds that allow users to easily browse the NFT wallets of other collectors and leave comments on profiles and individual [NFT](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) pages. It is similar to an Instagram feed, for example, and users will have profile pages dedicated to their respective wallets and will be able to follow and interact with other users.\n\nAlthough some of those features\u2014including comments\u2014will exist on Coinbase's own centralized servers at launch, the company said it will progressively decentralize those features and gradually move them to decentralized services in the future.\n\nAt launch, Coinbase does not offer the ability to forge NFTs through the platform, but such a feature is on the way. Additionally, Coinbase also plans to host new NFT projects through the marketplace, including some created by its various launch partners.\n\nAn NFT is a blockchain-based token that proves ownership of an item, including things like artwork, profile pictures, sports memorabilia, and video game items. The NFT market reached a transaction volume of 25 billion dollars in 2021, led by the main market, OpenSea, which could be the main rival of Coinbase NFT.\n\nCoinbase NFT has brought together dozens of prominent creators and artists as launch partners, including popular projects like Azuki , Doodles, and World of Women ; creators like PPP please , Gary Vaynerchuk , XCOPY, and Pak; and media brands such as TIME and Rolling Stone . Actor Bill Murray and rocker Ozzy Osbourne also make the list with their respective NFT projects.\n\nAlthough the Bored Ape Yacht Club and creator Yuga Labs are not listed as official launch partners in Coinbase documents, the platform recently announced a collaboration to create a trilogy of short films based on Ethereum's popular NFT collection. Yuga Labs also owns the CryptoPunks and Meebits IPs following a recent acquisition from Larva Labs .",

Which is why some launchpads like soIana prime are implementing insurance funds to protect investors from IDOs that make money but  decide to go rogue all of a sudden. \n\n But the pseudonymous nature of the crypto space doesn\u2019t mean that alleged scammers can always disappear without consequences, as these guys found out. And the platform is generally getting safer everyday since it grabbed attention of a lot of scam artists that wanted to make quick money last few years. More stories like this will expunge the space of these rampant scam projects.",

            "text": "Ever since the [Ethereum network development ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development)had launched its Beacon Chain for staking in December 2020, enthusiasts have waited for the day when the chain will finally merge with the Ethereum mainnet, ushering in the Proof-of-Stake consensus to be the the only mechanism through which a new ETH is created. While a specific date for the merger has unfortunately not yet been revealed, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has now said that \u201chopefully we will merge very soon\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on a recent podcast the engineer also lamented the constant delays this transition has faced, adding,\n\n*\u201cIf we really want to achieve that vision, I still think there is a lot of work to be done that we hoped would be done now or even by 2016.\u201d*\n\nButerin also touched on the aspects of the transition that have not been finished yet, and most of it has to do with testing. Since most blockchain programs are used by an indefinite number of people who trust millions of dollars, constantly testing the software for perfection is a necessary step, even if one wants to fall victim to an exploit similar to the ones that the Ethereum network is so used to.\n\nHowever, Buterin said that in addition to testing, \"there are already some basic test stats and full implementations of everything that needs to happen for the merge,\" including consensus clients and execution clients, the latter of which has had some limitations, according to him.\n\nHowever, what requires more testing is the initial synchronization process, which Buterin explained as the mechanism behind the integration of new nodes to the network and their contract code. Of course, there are many other subtleties and technicalities that need to be taken care of, Vitalik said, adding that his team believes the merger may take place sometime between June and August of this year.\n\nIt should be noted here that the merger is just one of the first steps in Buterin's vision for [Ethereum development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development), and the network could see steady development for the foreseeable future. While the executive had previously revealed a roadmap on Twitter laying out the post-merger phases, he explained the same as:\n\n*\u201c\u2026the merger that was basically proof of stake, the surge that is increasing the capacity of the chain, basically sharding and doing a little bit more stuff before and after that. Then there's edge which are vertical trees which are basically a technology that makes string validation easier... Then there's purge which makes the string lighter and the code wider and then there's waste which is just everything else .\u201d*\n\nThe exec agreed that while many additional buzzwords and enhancements were in the works, such as ZK Snarks, EVM buildup, and proposal builder separation. If only POS merge and sharding are implemented, \"we're still in a good place.\" This could be the case considering that the biggest problems Ethereum is currently facing are its reliance on mining and lack of scalability, which sharding is intended to fix.\n\nTherefore, Vitalik believes that Ethereum \u201cwill definitely be big enough to\u201d become the sole transaction layer for the Internet or global financial activity once the Surge phase of its transition takes place.",

            "text": "Ethereum has amazed everyone, not just the people within the crypto community, but also those outside with its growth. According to CoinMarketCap, the current market value of ETH Share has exceeded 21%, its highest level since August 2017. In fact, the market value share of ETH reached 31.17% in June 2017.\n\nNow, as the popularity of Ethereum increased, so did the cost of doing business on the network: gas fees, the amount of gwei (a fraction of ETH) charged per transaction, has steadily increased, despite the fact that there are downward trends from time to time.\n\nThe plot attached here can be used to show the same. It goes without saying that the intense debate over Ethereum gas fees will continue for a long time to come. Especially since people like Su Zhu, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, have hit ETH on the same thing in the past.\n\n#### \"Gas rates cannot be avoided\"\n\nJoe Lubin, Co-Founder of Ethereum and CEO of ConsenSys, has a different perspective, however. During a recent interview, he stated:\n\n*\u201cHigh gas rates are a measure of success. They are a growing pain, they are something that cannot be avoided \".*\n\nIn fact, he shed more light on the overall success of ETH with an interesting analogy. He opined,\n\n*\u201cWhen a new technology is successful, it always has problems of scale. So whether it's CPU cycles, screen space, or memory, you'll basically have software engineers to maximize the capabilities of the technology. And it turns out that we are seeing consumers maximizing the capabilities of technology. \"*\n\n#### Any solution?\n\nUnsurprisingly, Lubin also addressed the Ethereum 2.0 issue . According to the executive, it should arrive in \"the second quarter or possibly move to the third quarter next year.\" In addition, he argued that it will help address both transaction costs and energy use. Solana, avalanche we offer fast transactions with cheap gas rates. Unfortunately, even those protocols are not immune from rising fees.\n\n*\"We are already seeing scalability at Layer 2, and at Layer 2 we are seeing hundreds and soon tens of thousands of transactions per second that are actually very cheap: they are cheap for Solana, cheap for avalanches.\"*\n\nHe continued adding,\n\n*\u201cThose are great systems, Solana and Avalanche, and as consumers use them more, we see the transaction fees go up to $ 1 and $ 2 for those technologies. The*[ *development of Ethereum*](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) *will be the blockchain of blockchains. It will be the most important digital asset settlement layer, it will be the coordination layer for many different Layer 2 technologies. \"*\n\nRegardless of the fee aspect, ETH continues to develop rapidly. It is close to 200,000 validators on the web. Now, with ETH 2.0 and the transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism, that number will grow exponentially.\n\n*\"The barrier to entry is very low, so anyone can do it.\"*\n\nThis, in fact, has certainly been the case, with[ development of Ethereum](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) emerging as the winner against the rest of the market in many people's projections. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, for example, in an interview Willing support for ETH over Bitcoin.\n\n*\u201cPeople see Ethereum as a technological gamble. Ethereum becomes more promising compared to Bitcoin as the Fed stops pumping cash into the economy. \"*\n\nWill this help ETH outperform BTC? Well, not soon.",

These include a one-time history expiration that would take place after the Merger, as well as a periodic history expiration with a changing deadline, formally known as EIP-4444. He clarified that *both* solutions could be implemented.\n\nOne user asked about the proponent / builder separation (PBS). Buterin recently posted about this method which was intended to prevent block proponents, or miners, from adding transactions to the block in a way that benefits them.\n\nFor his part, Buterin explained ,\n\n*\u201cStatelessness + PBS would allow independent validators to run with basically no storage requirements. Only the builders and thin client servers would have storage requirements. \"*\n\nButerin cautioned that PBS had not yet been fully developed and tested. Even so, he spoke about the maximum withdrawable value \\[MEV\\] theft and said ,\n\n*\"Personally, I think we'll have to have PBS or an expiration status eventually (or maybe both), and PBS seems more realistic because it's urgent for other reasons (MEV).\"*\n\nMeanwhile, [Ethereum development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) Improvement Proposal-4444 deals with historical data on Ethereum clients. Old blocks on the Ethereum chain supposedly translate to more than 400 gigabytes of hard drive storage space. This means that validators must buy even larger disks . EIP-4444 suggested ,\n\n*\u201cCustomers should stop posting historical headers, bodies, and receipts more than a year old in the p2p layer. Customers can locally delete this historical data. \"*\n\nOne AMA user was not sure that the historical expiration would bring benefits to the end user. In response, Buterin said ,\n\n*\u201cRunning a node gets cheaper. Alternatively, it could be used to justify a moderate increase in the gas cap, which would lower transmission rates. \"*\n\n### Roll me up\n\nRollups have an important role to play in the [Ethereum development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) ecosystem as they are the layer two solution for scaling transactions in the second largest crypto by market capitalization. However, Reddit users wanted to know how rollups would access history and expired data.\n\nButerin assured users and said ,\n\n*\u201cIt is very unrealistic for old data to disappear completely; too many services have an interest in ensuring their availability: block explorers, any major stakeholder in the rollup ecosystem, exchanges\u2026 \"*",

Further, she also uncovered many unpredictable and unexpected recent and fresh details regarding the history of Ethereum.\n\nIt also offers a great interface that takes you to the realities of running a project structured along with the arguably self-ruling lines. It also offers a functional introduction to the topic of Ethereum, its features, and also the reasons that matter the topic of Ethereum. The ones who are new on the journey to the Crypto world must probably look elsewhere.\n\nMing Chan, who assisted as the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Chief Executive Director, is characterized as manipulative and conniving.\n\nWith ethereum moving towards becoming more sustainable, many projects like SET, ZeLoop, Plastiks, etc, are also working towards developing a rewarding recyclemagement system.\n\nFurthermore, \"The Cryptopians,\"  tells the story of Ethereum through the introduction of the year 2018. \nHeretofore, its price has more than tripled, and Ethereum has become the network underlying most of the extraordinary advancements in the crypto world.\n\n\"The Cryptopians\u201d puts real substance behind the crypto population\u2019s longstanding antipathy.",

They said they were used to keep the network secure, and now that Ethereum is moving to Proof-of-Stake, their roles were being overlooked.\n\nSome miners even planned a 51% attack to protest the EIP. For that, their tactic was to gather all the hash rate they could in a single pool, luckily they didn't succeed.\n\nHowever, the price of Ether reacted well to the burning of part of the mining, which kept the good profits for the miners and nobody talks about it anymore.

This Wednesday (11), the average cost to process a transaction rose to US$21, a 50% increase in six days, according to BitInfoCharts data [.](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-btc-eth.html) \n\nThis is the highest price seen since May 22, when rates hit $22. Since August began, using the network has gotten 162% more expensive.\n\nThe 22% appreciation that the ETH accumulates throughout the week does not fail to influence the increase in rates in dollars. However, gas rates measured in gwei follow the same upward pattern. This Wednesday, gas hit 65.2 gwei for the first time in nearly two months of decline, according to data from YCharts .\n\nThe EIP-1559 improvement included in last week's Ethereum hard fork caused all ether used to fund transactions to be burned rather than going to the miners. \n\nSince then, an algorithm is responsible for regulating the price of the base rate according to market activity, increasing the gas when the movement increases and decreasing when it is calmer.\n\nAlthough the upgrade has emerged as a way to solve the rate problem and make it less volatile, network costs still skyrocket when activity grows. After all, [Ethereum development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) can still only process a limited number of transactions at a time.\n\n## NFTs move the network\n\nThe spike in non-fungible token trades ( NFT ) may be boosting Ethereum rates. Etherscan data shows that OpenSea, one of the top NFT markets today, is responsible for paying 14% of all network fees in the last 24 hours. In fact, the platform broke a record on Sunday (11), reaching a historic volume of US$ 78 million, according to Dune Analytics .\n\nAt this pace, Open Sea left behind Uniswap , the largest decentralized exchange in the industry that until then was responsible for the largest consumption of fees on the Ethereum network.",

For the moment, the second 'crypto' by market capitalization has failed to notice repercussions and remains around 3,500 dollars, with little relevant falls, since **all the 'altcoins' follow in the wake of a bitcoin** that continues to consolidate.\n\n**Bitcoin is trading little, around $ 48,000** , \"it is leading the market and moving in a fine range between its support and resistance line,\" says Alejandro Zala, Bitpanda's country manager in Spain. \"Their daily candles remain volatile as the market is trying to find new levels of demand.

So there is no need to pay high fees.\n\nWith this solution, you only need to pay commissions to bring in money for the rollup. Or, when the user wants to withdraw it, which implies configuring transactions on the main blockchain.\n\nArbitrum as well as other scaling solutions alleviate congestion in Ethereum and add value to the blockchain.\n\nAmong the benefits is the program that will reward anyone who finds bugs or errors in smart contracts. Depending on the type of error found, amounts paid can range from US$1,000 to US$1,000,000.\n\nIn addition, Arbitrum received endorsement from several companies after conducting a $120 million funding round.\n\n\u201cWe will use the newly acquired capital to grow our team and continue to invest heavily in research and development,\u201d said Offchain Labs co-founder Steven Goldfeder.\n\nThe funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Polychain Capital, Ribbit Capital, Redpoint Ventures, Pantera Capital, Alameda Research and Mark Cuban.",

The whole essence of this post is to equip readers with the right knowledge to leverage before investing in any crypto project.\n\nThere are a few things you need to know before investing in any crypto project. Most importantly you need to know about the viability of the crypto project's business case and the reputation of the individuals behind the project. Sadly, most times the ability to carry out this due diligence is not readily available and this is why over $80 million dollars have been lost to crypto scams in the United States alone. Crypto scams have indeed ravished the crypto ecosystem and drastically reduced investor confidence and trust.\n\nFortunately, an easy and straightforward way to gain valuable insight into the viability and integrity of crypto projects exists in the form of platforms like the RiseUp V2 platform. These platforms provide users with a way to screen smart contracts and wallets on the most widely used blockchains including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon.\n\nTherefore, always ascertain the true nature of crypto projects leveraging the aforementioned crypto projects before you consider investing.",

            "text": "Less than 1 week after turning 6 years old, the Ethereum network is getting ready for a very important update, the so-called \u201cLondon Hard Fork\u201d.\n\nEthereum as a whole is undergoing a major transition process: the algorithm is migrating from Proof-of-Work (\u201cproof of work\u201d, used by Bitcoin) to Proof-of-Stake (\u201cproof of participation\u201d), which will increase your transaction capacity per second, and possibly lower your high *gas fees*.\n\nIn this process, the next big update is the \u201cLondon Hard Fork\u201d, scheduled to take place between today (04) and tomorrow (5th).\n\nIf you have ETH in your wallet, you don't have to do anything. The update is done automatically.\n\nThe name of the city, in this case, London, is inspired by the cities where the network's developer conferences took place.\n\nThe update is an improvement to the user experience and, among other improvements, includes EIP-1559, which changes the dynamics of fees paid by users.\n\n**Understanding the London Hard Fork better**\n\nToday, the ETH is an inflationary currency, with no limits. At each block validation (+-15 seconds), miners are rewarded with newly created coins and transaction fees paid by users.\n\nThe protocol update includes 5 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), including EIP 1559 and EIP 3554, which aim to:\n\n\\-double the Ethereum network *gas* limit, which will increase transaction capacity.\n\n\\-change the reward to miners.\n\nOn this last point, it is worth understanding better how this will be done. The new proposal is that the base rate has a \u201cbase\u201d value, which will be automatically adjusted by the protocol, according to network congestion. When the network exceeds the *gas* per block target, the base rate will increase slightly, and when capacity is below the target it will decrease slightly.\n\nAs these base rate changes will be constrained, the maximum difference in base rate from block to block will be predictable.\n\nAn important aspect of this fee system is that miners will only be able to receive the block's priority and reward fee, while the base fee will always be burned (i.e. sent to a wallet that no one has access to).\n\nAmong other more technical factors, this burning will help to balance Ethereum inflation, and significantly lessen the practice of tax manipulation by miners, who often do so to try to extract more fees from users.\n\nIn addition, users will also be able to manually set the maximum transaction fee, which would help them to limit their total costs per transaction.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe London Fork is the starting point for a series of changes to the way miners operate on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIt is unlikely to turn ETH into a deflationary asset. This should only happen around December 2021, when the network changes its consensus algorithm, leading to a large drop in the ETH emission rate to around 0.4% pa\n\nThis 90% emission reduction is compared to 3 BTC halvings, which is where the \u201ctriple halving\u201d arises, as seen in the historical and projected ETH emission rate graph below (in the orange line stretch between \u201c1/1 /2021\" and \"1/1/2022\"). It is only after this event that the network is likely to become deflationary.\n\nApparently, London has been benefiting from the price of ETH in recent weeks. In the last 7 days alone, the price of ETH has already risen by more than 18%, while that of BTC has fallen by around 0.5%.\n\nPlease visit our page for ethereum token development\n\n[https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development)",

However, in October, the project partially migrated to high-yield rival Solana .\n\nIn January of this year, Audius had about 1 million monthly active users. That number soared to 5 million in August\n\nAs a result, Audius has become one of the most used blockchain apps \u200b.\n\n## TikTok joins Audios\n\nThe announcement of the partnership with TikTok was made this Monday by company executives, exclusively to Rolling Stone (NASDAQ: [STNE](https://br.investing.com/equities/stoneco-ltd) ).\n\nAccording to Forrest Browning, Audius Product Director, with the partnership, any artist will be able to take a song from the platform and export it to TikTok with one click.\n\nAccording to Browning, while there are already ways to get music on TikTok without the help of a streaming platform, the process is \"clumsy\"\n\n\u201cThe teenagers who produce in their rooms may not even have distributors\u201d, he points out. \u201cA common way for non-label artists to put their content on the platform is to hold the phone next to a laptop while it plays their music and they add it as background music. It's not practical,\u201d he explained.\n\nIn addition to hundreds of little-known artists, the Audius app also manages to attract some big names, like the American DJ Skrillex.\n\nIn addition, Spotify, for example, faces constant criticism for paying low sums to musicians. Meanwhile, Audius allows creators to set their rules when it comes to monetization.\n\nNow, partnering with TikTok can bring even more independent music to the blockchain platform. Currently, more than 100,000 artists have music on Audius\n\nAccording to Audius co-founder and CEO Roneil Rumburg, artists want to find better ways to connect their TikTok followers to other places where they can monetize their work.\n\n## \u201cDecentralized Spotify\u201d pro-artist\n\nWhen it comes to blockchain usage, Browning noted that about 95% of Audius users are unaware that the technology is involved.\n\nHowever, he explained that the solution in [development of Ethereum](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) is crucial for the decentralized operation and for the platform's guidelines. After all, the blockchain eliminates the middleman and tracks transactions transparently.\n\nFurthermore, Audius also supports the already famous NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. However, these digital assets are not in the platform's buying and selling business. Instead, NFTs in Audius act as engagement and social tokens, unlocking extra features.\n\nFinally, Browning highlighted the pro-artist ideology and principles of the blockchain streaming platform:\n\n\u201cWhile I can understand Spotify's business model, they probably don't want people going to TikTok from a monetization perspective. But we don't really care where your listeners are coming from or what we help enable. We're just here to get as many ears as possible.\u201d",

Thus, the tokens used to fund transactions are burned instead of going to the miners, which reduces the supply of ether and avoids any deliberate congestion in the network.\n\nThe difference between the old version is that miners no longer set rates; the network uses an algorithm, creating more consistency across the Ethereum ecosystem. \n\nThe measure is also important because it will curb the currency's inflation by taking ETH out of circulation and helping to reduce its supply in the market \u2014 which in theory could help its appreciation.\n\nThe hard fork will feature four more improvements that come to make the ecosystem more stable and efficient, such as the EIP-3529 that does away with the gas refund system.\n\nWith the update completed on the network, the ETH goes up 1.7% and is worth $2,620.

            "text": "India-based Polygon Network has been trending for a while now. Recently, the [development of Ethereum](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development)\\-powered network acquired a zero-knowledge (ZK) protocol developer, Mir, for around $ 400 million. Now, you are implementing a test network that could possibly increase MATIC by 3 times in the current cycle.\n\n### Unroll\n\nPolygon, a Layer 2 scaling solution inspired by [Ethereum development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development), launched[ a blog](https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-is-bringing-eip-1559-upgrades-to-its-network-with-a-testnet-release/?utm_source=Twitter-Main&utm_medium=Tweet&utm_campaign=Tier-1-Announcement) to address the latest development. According to the official blog, Polygon's core development team:\n\n*\"... is deploying a testnet implementation of the Ethereum Enhancement Proposal (EIP) 1559 to introduce the burning of its native MATIC token and better visibility of fees.\"*\n\nIt goes without saying that ETH, the largest altcoin was the first ecosystem to undergo this hard fork, also known as ' London Fork '. In fact, it was one of the biggest changes in its history. Following the same route, the blog noted: \u201c\n\n*\u201cPolygon is taking steps to bring that much-requested upgrade to our network. It will go live on the Mumbai testnet on December 14 at 8am. M. UTC \".*\n\n### Advantages\n\nIntroducing the aforementioned changes will have far-reaching implications for all Polygon stakeholders. That's how.\n\nLet's see in the context of Ethereum. EIP-1559 changes the way the fee market works on the [development of Ethereum network](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development). It introduces a new base fee that is burned instead of paying miners. Users can now specify a maximum rate and a priority rate for transactions, instead of the price of gas.\n\nThe discrete base rate for transactions to be included in the next block varies depending on network congestion.\n\n*(For context: the transaction fee is calculated using the following equation: transaction fee = baseFee + min (maxFee - baseFee, priorityFee)*\n\nHowever, the changes do not reduce the fees paid for transactions, as prices are determined by supply and demand. Instead, it allows users to better estimate costs. This will result in fewer users overpaying. Ethereum has certainly enjoyed some advantages after the hard fork.\n\n### Deflationary effect\n\nPolygon's MATIC has a fixed supply of 10 billion. Therefore, any reduction in the number of available tokens will have a deflationary effect.\n\n*\u201cWe took the Ethereum experience since the upgrade as the basis for simulating the potential impact on the total supply of MATIC. The analysis suggests that annualized burning would represent 0.27% of the total supply of MATIC \u201d, added the team.*\n\nMeanwhile, deflationary pressure will benefit both validators and delegators, because their rewards for processing transactions are denominated in MATIC.\n\n### MATIC to the moon?\n\nWell, sure. The popular YouTube series on cryptocurrency trading \u201c Coin Office \u201d opined that Polygon (MATIC) could grow \u201cAnother 2-3x\u201d in this cycle \u201c. The aforementioned update would be a catalyst.\n\n*\"If you're wondering how far MATIC could go before this bull market ends, a conservative estimate is another 2-3 times.\"*\n\nWell, overall, the flagship coin could use some catalyst to help it get into the top 10 list in the crypto market. The 16th largest token was trading at the $ 1.86 mark with a 5% correction at press time.",

The year 2021 might spell a new chapter for the applications of blockchain technology with the rising popularity of NFTs. The sale of an NFT art collection by digital artist Beeple for $69 million set a completely new benchmark for NFTs.\nBy enabling digital representations of individual items combined with the benefits of smart contracts, NFTs can remove intermediaries and connect content creators with audiences directly, offering blockchain-generated certificates of authenticity for digital assets. Thereby, the concept of NFTs has the potential to change the current crypto and art landscape drastically.\n \nChoosing a crypto wallet and cryptocurrency to fund a wallet\nWhen a desirable collection and an NFT marketplace are chosen, collectors need to create an account on the marketplace in order to buy NFTs. Before doing so, however, they will need to connect their cryptocurrency wallet to the chosen NFT platform, as until then, they won\u2019t be able to buy or sell anything.\nA crypto wallet as a place to securely keep digital assets is an essential part of any blockchain system. Crypto community members need wallets to use blockchain services, access various platforms, sign transactions, and manage their balances according to blockchain fundamentals. In this way, all crypto platforms and NFT marketplaces, in particular, eliminate the need to store user account data, making their operations more accurate and secure.\nBefore setting up a wallet, it is crucial to ensure that the wallet matches the cryptocurrency used on the platform the buyer intends to use. As most of the NFT services are Ethereum-based, they accept Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) as a viable payment.\n\nTop NFT Marketplaces that You Must Consider!\n\u00b7       1. TRON\nTRON blockchain was created with the sole purpose of countering the drawbacks of the Ethereum blockchain. Recently, the TRON blockchain has released its very own NFT marketplace named DeFine. But each and every application and NFT platform that is being associated with the TRON network requires the functionality of its native token called TRON token.\n \n\u00b7       2. OpenSea\nOpenSea boldly describes itself as being the largest NFT marketplace. It offers a wide range of non-fungible tokens, including art, censorship-resistant domain names, virtual worlds, trading cards, sports, and collectibles. It includes ERC721 and ERC1155 assets. You can buy, sell, and discover exclusive digital assets like Axies, ENS names, CryptoKitties, Decentraland, and more. They feature over 700 different projects, including trading card games, collectible games to digital art projects, and name systems like ENS (Ethereum Name Service).\n \n \n \n\u00b7       3. Overeality.io\nWorld\u2019s first upcoming incubator that promotes DAO-selected NFTs to bring culture and entertainment to the Metaverse. Overeality incubates NFTs through a DAO-selection process, where everyone can participate in next-generation IP creation. Our community promotes and creates a trending culture and lifestyle for the Metaverse by facilitating social networking through NFTs.\n \nThese three are the ones that I found the most intriguing based on a number of things. Which ones do you think should be on this list?",

            "text": " \n\nMy story begins with investing in a number of successful, as it seemed to me at that time, ICOs. Inspired by the market growth rate in 2017, I clearly decided, that blockchain is our future, my future... I made my way through a careful analysis of the technology itself and identified several ICOs to enter the cryptocurrency market, and only 1/4 of them turned out in the profit zone, several projects completely collapsed and were forced to cease operations. There is a list of projects, that give my heart a hope for a happy future. Here they are:\n\n**1) Zilliqa**\n\n**2) Quarkchain**\n\n**3) Credits**\n\n# Zilliqa\n\nThe project, immediately attracted the enormous attention of the majority of market participants. A group of young developers from the University of California decided to create their own platform, which will be able to increase capacity of the network in direct proportion to the growth of network nodes. So let's say this is the improved equivalent of Ethereum. A noticeable technological \u201ctrick\u201d of Zilliqa is the use of sharding that is the technology which splits up the main network into sections (subnets), which contributes to an increase of its operation speed.\n\nROI according to current price\n\n4.81x USD, 16.45x ETH, 19.27x BT\u0421\n\n# Quarkchain\n\nThe QuarkChain project is being developed to improve the three main features of digital currency: scaling, decentralization and functional reliability. To address these issues, advanced technologies are used and integrated which creates a full-fledged infrastructure not only for a cryptocurrency, but also for the smart contract platform. Among the advantages of QuarkChain is the successful testing of the initial version in closed mode. Already at the initial stage the network bandwidth exceeds 2000 transactions per second.\n\nROI according to current price\n\n2.08x USD 9.94x ETH 4.23 BTC\n\n# Credits\n\nCredits is an open blockchain platform for autonomous smart contracts that implements its cryptocurrency. This platform will provide instant transactions, over 1,000,000 transactions per second. It will be possible to create truly independent decentralized services thanks to the new advanced features. Credits platform is able to open a new large-scale market and fully realize the full potential of using technologies in the network based on smart contracts. The uniqueness and functionality of the platform: access to a new level of relationship between the Internet of Things and DLT. At the moment, the average bandwidth of the platform is 130k per second.\n\nROI according to current price\n\n0.53x USD 3.83x ETH 1,5x BTC\n\nThis year was not the best to start investing. As a newcomer to the market, I grasped all the serious things that could happen to me. A flurry of regulations, endless falls, forks of the BTC, unfulfilled promises of the projects led to a number of losses on the battlefield. I almost lost my wife and house, taken a loan in the hope of successful repayment by the end of the year. But despite all the difficulties, I got a great experience, knowledge, skills. From an ordinary soldier, I turned into a lieutenant. I am proud of my choice, I am proud of this technology, the developers of the projects presented above are doing an incredible job, demonstrating unique developments that change consumer consciousness and the world. People like the representatives of the Zilliqa, Quarkchain and Credits teams inspire me to a new leap in 2019 without any doubt in my heart that it will bring more joy and perspectives to this world and my home.\n\n**Happy New Year btw!**",

We also know and have worked with each other outside of the crypto world.\n\nMooncoin for us is a long-term project. It retains a marketing and development fund wallet which will be used to develop Mooncoin and ensure its growth and success. Our singular aim is to turn Mooncoin into a decentralised financial services powerhouse and thus generate enormous wealth for all its holders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Mooncoin Vision**\n\nThe aim of Mooncoin is no different from the original vision for blockchain and cryptocurrency: to provide a trustless, permissionless, fully decentralised, non-custodial store-of-value that can be transferred, traded, and transacted without the need for any intermediaries; To eliminate the intercession of any centralised authority; To ensure that this store of value is fundamentally protected from concerns such as inflation, achieved by placing hard limits on supply via provable mathematical algorithms.\n\nMooncoin aims to expand on these goals but in rather a modern way, building on top of more recent innovations in the cryptocurrency space. Mooncoin will provide a store-of-value that takes these principles yet further, ensuring that a truly decentralised system for wealth accumulation and spending is made available in a much more grassroots fashion than possible with more traditional cryptocurrencies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n=====================================================\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Website: [moonwallet.org](https://moonwallet.org) ([https://moonwallet.org/](https://moonwallet.org/)) \n\n\ud83d\udcd9 Light Paper: Read Here ([https://dd3qbppzqodhu.cloudfront.net/lightpaper.pdf](https://dd3qbppzqodhu.cloudfront.net/lightpaper.pdf)) \n\n\ud83d\udcdc Medium: 4 min read\n\n ([https://mooncoin-defi.medium.com/mooncoins-mnc-a-moonshot-with-real-utility-a6f14b3e985a](https://mooncoin-defi.medium.com/mooncoins-mnc-a-moonshot-with-real-utility-a6f14b3e985a))\ud83d\udce8 Telegram: @MooncoinDeFi\n\n\ud83d\udc26 Twitter: [https://twitter.com/mooncoindefi](https://twitter.com/mooncoindefi)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n=====================================================",

            "text": "It's no secret today there are many problems in the advertising industry. The advertising segment is going through a crisis. This direction requires global changes, despite the fact that the Internet provides various companies with a real and effective way to attract new users, while using a variety of tools to achieve these goals.\nThis method looks very convenient, but when the company produces a rapid advertising activity, the effect may be the opposite. For example, when the purpose of advertising content is the commercial benefit of the company, many users start from such content, so advertisers spend huge amounts of money in vain, while not getting the desired effect.\n\nAs a result of the analysis of the advertising market and possible solutions related to the search for more effective ways to promote their brand, some organizations have decided that it is necessary to tokenize the advertising industry and move this direction to a new decentralized level. To implement this idea, they need to pay attention to the quality of the advertising content. Elsol Company aims to combine most of the types of publishing activities of the brands on the platform [Infleum](http://infleum.io/en/index) that supports all the most innovative advertising technologies. The developers plan to create this platform as a solution to all current problems in this direction for both large corporations and beginners.\n\n**How it works?**\n\nEach user has the opportunity to register on the Infleum platform.\nThey receive a personal combined wallet. Users can place requests for different advertising campaigns for other platform members. The advertiser generates smart-contract using the Smart Contract Agent Machine. The user will need to provide all information regarding the target audience, the region of coverage, the period of distribution of advertising content, the budget. The data is generated on the smart-contact and stored on it until any user of the platform is interested in this offer. All payments are made in IFUM tokens. The advertiser transfers funds to the service of the guarantor - Escrow. If, for any reason, the advertising order is not carried out and the terms of the contract are violated, the funds held by the guarantor are returned to the \u0441reator of the contract.  The funds are written off automatically If the order is executed.\n\n\n[Infleum](http://infleum.io/en/index) platform will coordinate actions and measure the performance of users using a special verification system that will evaluate their activity, the quality of tasks performed, the contribution to the work of the entire platform, thereby rewarding them in accordance with the consensus mechanism - Proof of Influence. This mechanism will be used to make recommendations to advertisers when creating a smart contract in the selection of a worthy candidate for the task. Marketing processes are automated and maintained on the basis of analysts a large amount of data with the use of artificial intelligence. The Infleum platform plans to use the Ethereum blockchain, but in the future the developers aim to launch their own Infleum network and fully transfer all the functionality.\n\n**Competition**\n\nUnlike its competitors, the Infleum platform offers users a new decentralized model that more cheaper, more reliable and affordable. Many competitors have an inefficient, wasteful and expensive model of service delivery. Infleum platform mainly uses the generation of smart contracts for advertising campaigns and plans to gradually increase the efficiency of these companies, while maintaining convenient functionality for all users. It is also important to note that the developers promise to provide a huge range of interrelated services when using the Influm platform. Users will be safe and free to choose the customer. Elsol is a company specializing in advertising with 30 years of successful experience in this direction in the South Korean market. Elsol has launched a working Infleum MVP - https://redi.to/, which includes a full set of advertising solutions for successful brand promotion. This service generates smart contracts for advertising companies.\n\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Infleum platform offers new opportunities for a large number of interested users in the direction of Internet marketing. It is no secret that there is serious competition in this direction. It is important to note that the Infleum platform has serious advantages over its competitors. One of these advantages is Elsol company with many years of experience in the South Korean market. The platform offers a real reliable and safe tool to promote your brand. Definitely Infleum will become one of the main players in the market.\n\n**More info**\n\n[Infleum](http://infleum.io/en/index)\n[Whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vi7Eush0SDUQxpyw4fX6IukfIAySTdHb/view)\n[ANN thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4979079.0)\n\nETH: 0x624E1336873749f13C4DFF5E4d05b85f1E8E9255\n\n",

This gives a raid growth to the social selling. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAstra is a blockchain integrated platform which provides infrastructure for social selling. Astra technology allow sellers to keep the customers data with them to provide better service. Here merchants acts as a mediator between sellers and brands. Merchants can make transactions with several sellers and brands. Merchants will charge for vendors, brands and advertiser's to provide the information about the products demand from the social surveys. Astra promotes fair and trustful behaviour in the ecosystem where every social seller gets equal distribution. Brands have their own model of distribution, they can independently conduct sale of goods, review and return actions. They can also perform advertising from traders about their brand. Distributors are engaged with several brands to provide sale of goods to the customer. With the availability of choice-able products customers can make sale. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Gemstra Token**\n\nGemstra uses GMS token which is ethereum blockchain powered ERC20 token.\n\n  \nBenefits of GMS token;  \n\u2022 GMS token used as a payment option in the platform  \n\u2022 Sellers and brands will make instant transactions at reduced cost  \n\u2022 GMS token will be used to provide commission and for reward purpose  \n\u2022 With GMS tokens customers can get discounts \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo find more details, please check [website](https://gemstra.com/) and [whitepaper](https://docsend.com/view/xvyqq7a).\n\nBounty0x username: hashin",

These coins will allow them to run existing applications on the blockchain from day 1. The exchange rate will be 1-to-1, accounting for the early-adopter\u2019s bonuses. While there is no plan to impose period for this exchange, all technical measures will be taken to enable the exchange of 100% of the tokens into coins, in the first day. The tokens are burned upon conversion into KaaS blockchain coins. We will offer compatibility between Ethereum ERC20 and ERC223 wallets where the tokens are stored and the KaaS wallets where the coins will be stored.\n\nThe actual coin of the new KaaS blockchain will be minable, with dynamic complexity.",

Such as random number, sports game result, and timestamp  etc. It is also running on another layer of Blockchain and running as a  cluster to ensure the security and consistency of the service.\n\n\u2022  Faireum supports the concept of Blockchain as a service. By providing  the RPC and restful service, it is easy to create a new wallet or to  integrate Faireum with existing gaming systems. For example, if one  gambling system only wants to use the FairCash as its payment method, it  is easy to integrate it as a regular clouding service by using the API.\n\n\u2022  Faireum provides the programming language integration. In the later  release, we will provide the SDK in JavaScript, Python, and Java.  Faireum will create a blockchain environment tailored to the online  gaming industry based on P2P smart contracts that will serve both  third-party online gaming developers and end users.\n\n[https://faireum.io/](https://faireum.io/)",

Pledges are used to help businessmen and pioneers support their mission to see that their creative initiatives are fully subsidized. Ichiba enters into its own scene, ensuring that they are original and comply with industry principles assessed by the Ichiba group.\n\nSo, basically, it is a platform for crowd funding in the block chain. The aim of the project is to create a kind of incubator for companies to raise funds to implement their plans further. From the moment of registration on the platform, the preparation of documentation and crowd funding rules will be provided to companies. Once upon a time, the ethereum gained popularity because of the opportunity to collect money for the development of the beginners. Ichiba, however, wants to register with such companies and deal with their own approvals, which means that the chance of fraud in the Ethereum network is reduced. Therefore, companies in this platform receive consultancy, support and supervision from Ichibo and investors receive an additional anti-fraud filter in the future, which should have a positive impact on the popularity of the platform.\n\n",

Ethereum gas fees are insanely out of reach when it comes to small buyers who can not afford it. Remember the time when the Ethereum network was going to be reachable for everyone? Well, that was so long time ago. I found this article on [Bitcoinist](https://bitcoinist.com/radix-teams-up-with-industry-giants-to-bring-defi-to-100-million/) where it discusses a non-profit organization called GoodFi which will focus on education, research and awareness in order to promote DeFi to a wider user base. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoodFi was initiated by Radix which will have a unique, scalable layer one protocol with very low gas fees. As Radix plans to combat with the current unfair system of DeFi and they also teamed up with leading partners such as Aave, Chainlink, MStable and others to tackle the problems that we face by promoting DeFi in widespread awareness. GoodFi plans to grow, which will involve gaining a better understanding of these applications\u2019 target audiences and highlighting the importance of learning about and using DeFi applications.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we take a look at GoodFi's partners here are some of the big projects involved:\n\nChainlink - The largest and most widely known decentralized oracle network providing reliable, tamper-proof inputs and outputs for complex smart contracts on any blockchain.\n\nAave- One of the most succesful defi projects. An open source and non-custodial liquidity protocol for earning interest on deposits and borrowing assets.\n\nRadix DLT- A layer 1 protocol specifically built for DeFi providing a safe coding environment and limitless scalability with easy interoperability for apps.\n\nmStable- A permissionless protocol built for unifying, securing and governing tokenised assets. mStable unites stablecoins, lending and swapping into one standard.\n\nMessari- A digital analystics research company bringing transparency to the cryptoeconomy by building data tools that will drive informed decision making and investment.\n\nIDEX- A multichain orderbook based decentralized exchange.\n\nYFdai-  A permissionless DeFi ecosystem combining Staking & Farming services with more to come including lending/borrowing, insurance launchpads and more.",

This rising population has created economic develop of many nation my managing the human resources capabilities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite the opportunity offers to the nations, there is need to look at the trending of the health care industry which study have shown that many individual or group of individual found it difficult to gain access to the healthcare facilities and centers due to the rising of the population where everybody medical needs are not meant by the health care centers or medical practitioner. This difficulties in my own opinion is that, is due to increase cost of medical services and the tools use in rendering this service. We understand that this rising population leads to unemployment rate where many many medical practitioner or medical software developer find it difficult to show case their usefulness in the society because their no hospital or clinics to employ them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIrrespective of this challenges the curestoken was develop to decentralize the healthcare industry for easy and flexibility of running health services to the nations of the world. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe curestoken is platform that is built with a reputable team of medical practitioners using the blockchain technology. Base on the level of transparency the blockchain technology offers the curestoken enhance this potential to bring accessibility of medical services to the nukes and cranny of the world irrespective of their geo political locations.\n\nIn achieving this aim the curestoken built six key sensitive pillars that decentralized the healthcare industry for both patient and medical practitioners in the following ways \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Health assurance platform\n* App store for Health apps\n* Electronic Health Records\n* Trading Platform\n* Marketplace and trust review  platform\n* Charitable trust fund\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTokenomy \n\nThe curestoken has it own native token called the \u201ccrs token \u201d which is use as a utility token in running of the services the curestoken ecosystem offer . This crs token is built on the blockchain technology. The Cures token will be used to purchase medical materials and it will be used to pay a medical services and acquire the services of medical practitioner.\n\nToken Sale Description\n\nToken Name :- CUREStoken  \n Abbreviation :- CURES  \n Type :- ERC-20  \n Network :- Ethereum-Based Token  \n Total Supply :- 500,000,000 CURES  \n Tokens available for ITO sale :- 175,000,000 CURES  \n Soft Cap :- 2000 ETH  \n Hard Cap :- 175,000 ETH\n\nEquivalent: - 1000 CURES / 1 Eth\n\nMinimum Investment: - 5 ETH (5000$)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinal thought.\n\nThe curestoken is new revolution in the crypto space that is purely design to address issues facing the centralized healthcare sectors.

As a result, developers who are building solutions on top of the TRON network will have access to the Link platform that speeds up the deployment of such apps. Also, Link reduces the cost of development by a significant margin.\n\n \n\nEssentially, Link is a blockchain infrastructure-as-a-service that enables developers to use smart contracts and blockchain protocols without necessarily having expertise in blockchain development. Developers can use Link to create standard web-based APIs for smart contracts based on programmatic blockchain networks such as TRON. The Link ecosystem uses the BLINK token as its main medium of exchange.\n\nSince its launch, the TRON blockchain has added lots of unique functionalities with an aim of attracting developers and other users. Its most significant achievement to date is overtaking the Ethereum blockchain to become the preferred choice for DApp developers. In fact, it currently has the highest number of DApp users, as well as the highest volume of DApp usage on a daily basis.",

All transactions based on blockchain technology are transparent and all data can be guaranteed not to be altered. Based on performance criteria, investors can choose a specific professional trading specialist to reflect and the strategies apply directly to the investor's own transactions.\n\nProfessional traders determine their compensation terms and thousand members can choose the best one for their investment strategies. The Bincentive ecosystem will help investment customers increase their return on investment, increase the profitability of professional investment experts and increase the income of the stock exchanges, and create a win-win situation for the entire ecosystem.\n\nBincentive provides a platform for the traditional experts, AI trading engine providers, and quantitative traders through quasi-Decentralized applications (Q-DApps) allowing them to offer their professional trading services. The investment clients interested in the expert's trading services can directly connect with them.\n\nEach of the trading service provider determines their own terms and conditions on which members (investment clients) have to agree with so that they can subscribe to their services. All the transactions agreed upon are done through smart contract, which ensures that all terms are automatically processed without fail.\n\nThe platform has a dual token system. The utility token is the BCNT token that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Members need to have the utility tokens, which they can purchase from the website or trading exchanges that support it in order to subscribe to the Q-DApp. The platform offers an alternative token known as MST (Margin Stable Token), whose value is entirely fixed to the value of BCNT. It is an internal token and therefore, not tradable on exchanges. The MST token is available for members who prefer to avoid the risks that are associated with the fluctuating value of BCNT.\n\n**ICO Details:**\n\nToken symbol: BCNT\n\nToken sale date: TBA\n\nAccepted payment method: ETH\n\nTotal supply: 1,000,000,000 BCNT\n\nICO: 375,000,000 BCNT\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [https://www.bincentive.com/](https://www.bincentive.com/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbounty0x username : hashin",

We aim to connect consumers and merchants to an innovative platform which will disrupt the current remittance service industry.\n\nWe utilise the Ethereum blockchain along with our unique infrastructure to facilitate cross-border payments utilising digital currencies.\n\nAt the current state smart contracts are inaccessible for any traditional banking- or payment systems, due to the fact how smart contracts are secured on blockchains, and the consensus is reached by miners.

All things needed to execute a smart contract under ordinary conditions still happens \u2014 an exchange is made, marked, and sent \u2014 just now, each one of those cooperations are taken care of out of sight by Link, far from the client.\n\nIn case you\u2019re an engineer hoping to enroll a keen contract with Link to make an application, the procedure is very basic. Register a smart contract by giving its location and ABI to Link. At that point, Link creates a lot of endpoints from the ABI. The Link application engineer would then be able to change these endpoints to their loving by renaming the way or parameters, and Link will deal with mapping those to the fitting contract capacity and parameters. Link additionally creates an API key for your utilization, and an Ethereum account that Link will use to perform demands for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://blockmason.link/](https://blockmason.link/)",

If you and your Kitty win, you can earn tokens as a reward to obtain goods for fighting kitty and virtual currency. I will also introduce about KittiesHell, which can be said as the big attraction of KittieFight.  KittieFight is still under development and most of the information on the homepage is shown as coming soon. Although there is much information that cannot be obtained, it is still a very intriguing game for blockchain gamer.  CryptoKitties is the first blockchain game with cat as the motif that allows users to buy and sell Kitty.  \nThe important thing about CryptoKitties is that the kittens are tokenized by the Ethereum standard ERC - 721. As a merit of tokenizing, users can connect it with other games and thus are able to prevent the character from disappearing due to the end of release. For these reasons, ERC - 721 has become widely used in blockchain games. ",

Such as random number, sports game result, and timestamp etc. It is also running on another layer of Blockchain and running as a cluster to ensure the security and consistency of the service.\n\n\u2022 Faireum supports the concept of Blockchain as a service. By providing the RPC and restful service, it is easy to create a new wallet or to integrate Faireum with existing gaming systems. For example, if one gambling system only wants to use the FairCash as its payment method, it is easy to integrate it as a regular clouding service by using the API.",

            "text": "\nHARA announced\u00a0the release of the HARA Chain\u00a0at the Blockchain Developer Friday event, hosted by the Indonesia Blockchain Hub. The tech event featured an\u00a0international panel of speakers, including HARA\u2019s CTO, Imron Zuhri, and Sr Blockchain Developer, Arkan Gilang.\n\nIn his presentation, Gilang spoke about\u00a0the new products HARA was revealingand how they would work in the HARA ecosystem. Apart from the HARA Chain, he also spoke about the HARA Token Bridge, the HARA Block Explorer, the HARA Wallet, and the HARA Data Exchange itself.\n\n\u201cWhy did we build HARA Chain? Because on Ethereum main net the transaction throughput is very low. Imagine if all the farmers using HARA token are updating their data; we have had this kind of throughput, so we built the new chain with more throughput,\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aArkan Gilang, HARA Sr Blockchain Developer\n\nThe throughput on the Ethereum Main Net is around 1.5 transactions per second.\u00a0On the HARA Chain, this rises to 500 transactions per second.\u00a0Gilang continued his argument that apart from the number of transactions,\u00a0using HARA Chain also greatly reduces costs\u00a0as internal transactions are free, and the chain can be fully customized to suit HARA\u2019s needs.\n\n\nHARA CTO Imron Zuhri speaks at the Blockchain Developer Friday\u00a0event\n\nThe HARA Token Bridge connects the HARA Chain to the Ethereum Main Net, and\u00a0allows token to transfer from the HARA net to the main net.\u00a0But in the future, as CTO Imron Zuhri explained, the bridge might also give HARA\u00a0increased flexibility to optimize their operations.\n\n\u201cFor example, if in the future we would want to change, instead of doing it in the Ethereum main net we want to switch to EOS of Cardano. Instead of doing a hard fork, what we can do is just create another bridge to that\u00a0token.\n\nIn a way HARA Token can be a chameleon. Right now, HARA token exists in Ethereum, but if it is necessary, if there is a better solution or if something more mature is there, HARA token can move there. Nobody can guarantee that Ethereum will be the winner of the chains, that\u2019s why we built that technology,\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aImron Zuhri, HARA\u00a0CTO\n\n\nThe event attracted a full room of people interested in Blockchain technology\n\nThe next additions the HARA team will be working on are integrating the HARA Data Exchange on the blockchain, and creating\u00a0the recently-announced HARA Wallet.\u00a0The creation of the wallet is in line with\u00a0HARA\u2019s aim to spur adoptionwith as many people as possible.\n\n\u201cOne of the main obstacles in blockchain is that it is very hard to use. I mean for the lay person when you want to buy something with Tokopedia, you just log into Tokopedia and buy it. But with blockchain you have to have a wallet, and then you have to have a secret key; it\u2019s very hard so we\u2019re trying to make that easier by creating our own wallet,\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aArkan Gilang, HARA Sr Blockchain Developer\n\n",

Owners of the tokens have the ability to participate in the company, reduce the transaction fees and give the token holders the right to receive a part of the profit made by the company. CCX tokens are implemented based on the most popular and advanced ERC20 protocol. The base for the tokens is the Ethereum blockchain with is relatively fast compared to alternatives. Thanks to that technology we are able to implement the token for all the payments processes and all of our sites without limitations. The main goal of the token will be to provide the possibility to freely trade and exchange tokens between users, our services and transfers between traders and other instruments. Holders of the CCX tokens will be able to trade CCX in pairs with all other currencies available on our market. CCX token holders will have a possibility to exchange fractional part of (\\~< $0,5) tokens for CCX and the payment option for trusted trading commissions. What\u2019s more, they will also have the right for immediate, unlimited and free transfers between members of our platform. Free transfers will be available between CoinCasso Exchange, CoinCasso wallets and ATM network for all token holders (members), as long as all services are performed within our internal infrastructure. \n\n CCX token holders will have also the right to possess the so-called CCX-POWER tokens, i.e. \u201cfreezed\u201d tokens kept in a verified wallet for a specific time. All new listing of coins beyond the initial ones will require additional assessment. CCX-POWER holders will have the privilege to vote and decide which of the planned tokens they want. Coins of the completely new project or less known in the global markets will be added on demand in the first place in pairs to CCX. If you or your project is based on token or coins and have a problem with listing on any market this is another reason why you should get CCX-POWER. \n\n [https://coincasso.io/](https://coincasso.io/) \n\n [https://coincasso.io/ENGLISH\\_CoinCasso\\_official\\_PLV1.pdf?v1.1](https://coincasso.io/ENGLISH_CoinCasso_official_PLV1.pdf?v1.1) \n\nbounty0x ID: hllelek33",

While HARA is a project has a  concept using blockchain technology built on Ethereum.\n\nAs  we know, the Bank and cryptocurrency are considered enemies, but HARA  proves that cooperation can be of mutual interest to get the best  results e including the people that HARA and the bank are trying to  reach. But Hara can be relied on by helping MSMEs connect to financial  institutions in the past few years.

            "text": " Beyond its basic functionality\u00a0\u2014 creating easy-to-use web APIs from difficult-to-access smart contracts\u00a0\u2014 Link also hosts a\u00a0variety of other features useful to\u00a0both developers and users alike. Features \n\n\u00a0**\u2014 Documentation & Sample Code** Link generates usage documentation for all registered smart contracts, including sample code, to\u00a0guide developers in how to\u00a0use the Link-generated app. This documentation is synched to\u00a0the app\u2019s configuration and hosted by Link, so developers do not need to\u00a0manage or update their documentation on their own. \u00a0\n\n**\u2014 Insights, Monitoring, & Data Visualization** Link provides visualizations, logs, and insights into how registered applications are being used, with tooling that makes all of the data filterable, sortable, and searchable. With Link, it is possible to\u00a0understand exactly how your app is being used, and even see how the associated smart contract is being used outside of Link for comparison. Developers can sign up to\u00a0receive notifications if there are ever any issues with their app, including if one of the associated accounts is running low on ETH to\u00a0cover transaction fees, or if error rates on the smart contract have increased. \u00a0\n\n**\u2014 User Directory Integration**\n\n Typical DApps and smart contracts rely on Ethereum's native authentication, using an\u00a0Ethereum account's public/private key-pair. Link uses a\u00a0delegated authentication model, so transactions on a\u00a0smart contract are signed using an\u00a0Ethereum account within Link, which a\u00a0developer can connect to\u00a0one or more identities within the Link app. These identities can be authenticated in any number of ways. Link supports a\u00a0variety of authentication methods for individual Link apps, so users and developers can seamlessly integrate access with their own identity provider (e.g: Active Directory, Okta, SAML, OAuth), or let Link handle authentication and identity management for them. \n\n \u00a0**\u2014 Automated Ethereum Account Generation + Maintenance** \n\n Recall that when using a\u00a0typical web app, a\u00a0user will authenticate with a\u00a0trusted third party. For example, clicking \u201cLogin with Google,\u201d \u201cSign In with Facebook,\u201d or entering a\u00a0username and password which is stored by the app service provider.  \n\n In a\u00a0typical Link-based DApp, it is exactly the same from the end-user\u2019s perspective. They will authenticate with the DApp, thus proving their identity and accessing the app. However, in order to\u00a0communicate with a\u00a0programmatic blockchain-based network like Ethereum, this type of authentication isn\u2019t quite enough. a\u00a0DApp may have to\u00a0communicate with a\u00a0smart contract on a\u00a0user-by-user basis, which in turn means that each user would need their own Ethereum account. Link automatically generates these Ethereum accounts and manage them for DApp developers. Each account is trusted by the DApp and permitted to\u00a0interact with the Ethereum network on a\u00a0specific user\u2019s behalf. The DApp does not have to\u00a0provide any information about the users or identities it manages to\u00a0Link. Nor does the DApp have to\u00a0supply any of the user\u2019s private authentication details. The user connects to\u00a0the DApp, the DApp connects to\u00a0the Ethereum account, and together with Link they connect to\u00a0the Ethereum network. Of course, the DApp does need to\u00a0verify that the corresponding Ethereum account for a\u00a0particular user has sufficient ETH to\u00a0cover the transaction fees for any transactions the DApp intends to\u00a0perform. The Link developer can transfer ETH to\u00a0these managed accounts directly or allow Blockmason to\u00a0manage these accounts on their behalf, abstracting away transaction costs from end users. It is important to\u00a0note that Ethereum accounts generated within Link are managed exclusively by Blockmason\u00a0\u2014 the private keys are never available to\u00a0the Link developer.",

Using Link, a developer can create classic, conventional web-based APIs for any smart contract written on a programmatic blockchain. At the heart of Link is BLINK, the utility token which provides Link users with API transaction capacity.\n\n\u201cLink is the one-size-fits-all solution that enables you to build blockchain-based enterprise apps without the typical overhead of doing it all yourself,\u201d said\u00a0Devin Canterberry, Chief Technical Officer and head of Link development. \u201cLink handles deployment, logging, access control, authentication, monitoring, alerting, analytics, scaling, documentation, and infrastructure, so you don\u2019t have to,\u201d he continued, noting that \u201cWith Link, you write some code, click a button, and from there you\u2019re ready to use what you\u2019ve built.\u201d",

Starting with agriculture and food sector, HARA is an end-to-end solution for all stakeholders in the data exchange market for the world\u2019s most socially impactful sectors. It offers near-time valuable data that are crucial to increase productivity, reduce loss, and market efficiencies. \n\n \n\n### What is HARA?\n\n**HARA - The Equality Solution**\u00a0is a decentralized, secure and transparent platform that is built on top of an Ethereum-enabled blockchain. HARA token economics will reinforce a virtuous cycle that continues to grow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7h5ybgj6c9821.png?width=1686&format=png&auto=webp&s=aab378f8e2141486059a840adcf1d7d8bbaf6447\n\n \n\n**Data Providers**  \nData providers include individual data contributors, data companies, cooperatives, NGOs, field agents, and governments. They are rewarded for data submission, which they can monetize through token exchange.\n\n**Data Qualifiers**  \nData qualifiers add value to the ecosystem by providing verification in the form of proof of work. They acts as a crowd-sourced indicator of data quality, which overtime, will help improve the overall robustness of the data and help generate healthy, ongoing demand. Data qualifiers will receive tokens based on their efforts related to the tasks they perform in verifying data on the exchange. Data qualifiers can be any HARA token holders.\n\n**Data Buyers**  \nData buyers include enterprises such as banks, insurance companies, retailers, agriculture input suppliers, NGOs, and government \u2013 all the way down to local communities or even individuals.\n\n**Value-added Services**  \nCompanies and institutions that will buy and process raw data from HARA Ecosystem, and resubmit it as \u2018enriched data\u2019. These can be academic institutions, brands, data analytics, financial technology and agriculture technology companies. They create value-added insights from the raw data and share in the proceeds with the original data providers by submitting the cleansed, organized, and structured data back to the HARA Ecosystem.\n\n **The markets** that HARA will focus are developing countries located near to the equator, where agriculture has been vital to the country\u2019s economic development.\n\nThe sector employed almost 200 million people or equal to 23% of total population. In total, agricultural production value is worth US$ 499 billion, of which food production (e.g. cereals, food crops, and dairy products) contributes to almost 90% of total production. These countries also have high internet and mobile penetration rate, which are the requisite for the adoption of HARA platform. HARA started in Indonesia and will expand to empower billions in the other countries.",

They have taken the following steps to ensure our application is reliable and secure:\n\n\u25cf Writing code according to best practices, including extensive peer review;\n\n\u25cf Extensive and verifiable test coverage of application code, integration of static analysis tools into the continuous integration and deployment toolchain, and fully automated and auditable deployment infrastructure;\n\n\u25cf Professional, independent auditing of smart contracts interacting with Ethereum and Link;\n\n\u25cf Offering \u2018bug bounties\u2019 to encourage white-hat hackers to identify and eradicate coding errors;\n\n\u25cf Undergoing quarterly penetration tests and other independent security audits as part of our general security hygiene.\n\nAdditionally, while some developers or users may be concerned about the risks of offloading certain transactions to third-party applications, Link poses no more risk of data exposure than using Ethereum itself. Every transaction is still logged on the Ethereum layer; Link only retains a temporary copy while waiting to deliver the results of a call or transaction. Finally, even if a developer is using an account managed by Link, only a limited amount of funds to cover transaction costs are ever stored in that account. At any time, a developer may choose to connect a personal Ethereum account instead of using a Link-managed account. Link poses no risk to any connected accounts.\n\nWebsite: https://blockmason.link/",

While this has near limitless  applications, a\u00a0simple and familiar example would be a\u00a0hybrid-blockchain  authentication or authorization service. By delegating certain tasks  to\u00a0the Ethereum network, developers can utilize blockchain only for  those aspects of the product which benefit from added decentralization,  all while having a\u00a0UI that is completely indistinguishable from other  non-blockchain applications.\n\nTraditional Application Developers\n\nMany  traditional application developers are interested in harnessing the  power of the blockchain but don\u2019t have the resources or technical  knowledge to\u00a0do so.  Instead of facing the challenges of hosting their  own nodes or the hassles of using Infura, developers may now connect  to\u00a0the blockchain using Link\u2019s web APIs, creating a\u00a0blockchain-powered  application in minutes. For further comparison to\u00a0existing  infrastructure services, including Infura, see \u201cThe Next Step in Managed  Infrastructure\u201d below. Link also features multi-chain support, for DApp  developers that desire connectivity on many chains without the hassle  of supporting each chain in turn. Developers may rapidly launch  an\u00a0application on all platforms with nodes hosted by Blockmason, without  having to\u00a0code in anything other than JavaScript.

Now, they are turning to blockchain, and want to create a token that utilizes blockchain technology to revolutionize the way we receive healthcare.\n\n### Problems with Healthcare Today\n\nThe healthcare of today is facing several problems.\n\n* Important data is stored on centralized servers that can be turned off at any time\n* The process of getting insurance is takes a long time\n* The price of healthcare services increases each year.\n\n### How will Health FX Improve Healthcare?\n\nHealth FX\u2019s platform will utilize artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to find the right help for patients and eliminate all the mistakes that are being made today. Patients will then have their own private key to their medical data that can be accessed and shared at any time. The biggest advantage of using blockchain technology is that all information is stored in a public chain that can never be disabled because there are a huge number of computers around the world that maintain all data and information. With blockchain payments, it will become more difficult for fraud, as you have the ability to verify all data and actions that are being done.\n\nHealth FX\u2019s main values \u200b\u200bare quality, safety, and efficiency. With intelligent matching of services, treatments will be offered only by the best in the chosen field. Payments are simple and fast and patients have access to the information they should be entitled to access. Patients choose who will have access to their information and can be sure they get the right price for the service they need. Some countries want greater use for this decentralized application than others.\n\nIn some countries like Norway and Denmark, the price of healthcare is relatively low, but in most parts of the world, most institutions offering healthcare are private, and thus quite expensive when they are in need of such assistance. The goal is for everyone to have access to healthcare in a safe, tidy and less expensive manner. With blockchain technology, actions become more transparent as all transactions are saved and can be reviewed by anyone, at any time.\n\n \n\n### ICO\n\nThe company will conduct a capital injection in the form of ICO this summer.\n\nThe date of pre-sale is scheduled for June 16, while main ICO will start on July 14th.\n\nDuring the token issue, their own digital device, based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, HFX token will be released.\n\nThe minimum amount the company needs (soft cap) is 2.8 million US dollars, the maximum amount (hard cap) is 38 million dollars.\n\nA total of one billion tokens will be \u201cprinted\u201d. This number is fixed and cannot be changed afterwards.\n\nThe acquired capital will be used for legal purposes (5%), marketing (20%), operations(15%) and product development(60%).\n\nThe company behind this project has a long history behind it, with over 8 years in assisting patients to reach the right help. Health FX is led by Varun Panjwani, along with Charley Zuidinga and Vipula Samarakoon. With them, they have a number of advisors who have excelled in each field, including Laura Nelson Carney (AB Bernstein), Dilshaad Ali (CEO, Avivo Group), Ria Hoban (Director of APAC Digital Alliances & AI Accenture). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [http://www.hfxtoken.com/](http://www.hfxtoken.com/)\n\nWhitepaper: [https://www.hfxtoken.com/HFX\\_Whitepaper\\_v1.6.pdf](https://www.hfxtoken.com/HFX_Whitepaper_v1.6.pdf)\n\nBounty0x ID: ecamli",

Using Blockmason UI, the DApp design has no impact on the structure of several other applications. There is no immediate need for users to worry about Web 3 running Ethode, and that end users must start the Ether Gas bill.  \n**User Directory integration:** Transactions through this link are defined in smart contracts and signed with Ethereum accounts in connection.

This allows traditional developers to manage their web applications using the infrastructure of intelligent contracts.\n\n3.

It also opens the  blockchain-supported applications for users who are not familiar with  the Ethereum network. Despite the adoption of this blockchain  technology, developers and users still face the following problems:\n\n\\-  A big barrier to entry: entry barriers are high because developers must  learn new code in new languages \u200b\u200band must take a specific process to  sign, send, write and receive data from a chain of blocks.\n\n\\- Users have difficulty using a decentralized application because it is very difficult to understand and use.\n\n\\-  Link provides the creation and development of a huge database of open  source applications supported by smart contracts registered with Link.\n\n\\-  With Link users can create applications supported by the blockchain,  without the user's idea. Since Link automatically generates Ethereum  addresses for all applications, users do not need to have an Ethereum  account to access the network.\n\nDocumentation  and sample code: Link helps create usage documentation for all  registered smart contracts, including sample code that guarantees  developers how to use the Link app. In this application, users and  developers do not need to independently manage or update their  documents.\n\nAnalytics, monitoring and  data visualization: Link provides diaries, visualizations and an  understanding of how to save applications. Users and developers can  understand how the application works with Link, and developers can  subscribe to receive notifications if problems arise with their  applications.\n\nUser directory  integration: Link also supports various authentication methods for  individual Link applications. Users and developers can easily combine  access with their own identity providers (for example, Active Directory,  Okta, SAML, OAuth) or allow Link for authentication.\n\nAutomatic  creation and maintenance of an Ethereum account: Link creates an  Ethereum account, and when managing them for DApp developers, each  account can be trusted to a DApp and interact with the Ethereum network  on behalf of a specific user.\n\nWebsite: [https://blockmason.link/](https://blockmason.link/)\n\nWhite Paper: [https://blockmason.link/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Blockmason\\_Link\\_Whitepaper.pdf](https://blockmason.link/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Blockmason_Link_Whitepaper.pdf)",

The Wibson prototype mobile app will be the initial phase in supporting customers\u2019 capacity to monetize their data with direct offers from data buyers. Highlighted by an exclusive event for industry leaders and partners from the consumer data and blockchain worlds, the Wibson app launch will take place at the same time as the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona (Feb. 26th \u2013 March 1st).\n\nWith the release of the Wibson iOS and Android apps, people can connect to data sources, like Facebook and their mobile device location, watch offers from data buyers, and sell their personal data.\n\nWibson.org founder and CEO Mat Travizano explained that in today\u2019s economy, data means money but sadly that exchange hasn\u2019t made its way into consumer wallets\u2026until now. Wibson revolutionizes this dynamic by giving us back ownership over our personal information. Now consumers can access their data, and choose to profit from these transactions when and how they want.\n\nWibson is founded around a set of core principles aimed at protecting individuals. Since the marketplace is inherently transparent, individuals have total insight into the intended use of their data, such as if it is anonymized, who the buyer is and the amount they will be paid.\n\nTelefonica, Kenetic Capital, and DG Capital, are all investors in Wibson, among many other illustrious angel investors and funds.\n\nJehan Chu, Managing Partner of Kenetic Capital stated that not only does the Wibson marketplace benefit consumers by giving them the ability to control and monetize their personal information, it also provides corporate marketers, and advertisers access to high quality, certified data and an explicit consumer consent mechanism, which will be essential for when new privacy regulations, such as GDPR, come into effect in the near future. Wibson is addressing a huge personal data opportunity with a very intelligent and well thought out approach.\n\nDavid Garcia, Managing Partner of DGG Capital, explained that the personal data landscape is evolving quickly, and it is the perfect time to change how personal data is used and transacted. Improved transparency and consumer control of personal information may sound daunting to corporate marketers, but the marketplace\u2019s decentralized nature and inherent transparency will back a more efficient and fair marketplace that benefits everyone in the data ecosystem overall.\n\n**How it works**\n\n* Users can connect to data sources like Facebook and their mobile device location, monitor offers from data buyers, and sell their personal data.\n* When the data transaction is confirmed, consumers receive payment for sharing access to their data.\n* The Wibson personal data marketplace uses the blockchain network so that there is always a smart contract between data buyer and sellers that controls how consumers\u2019 personal information will be used.\n* Usual data buyers are businesses who are seeking validated personal data to better target offers and ads or non-profit organizations who are conducting social good research.\n* As of now, Wibson is running on the Ethereum test network and will be offering points for engagement that will be redeemable for the marketplaces\u2019 token, Wibcoin, when the complete network launches later in 2018.\n\nThe Wibson marketplace will be featured at the launch event taking place at the Mobile World Congress on February 27th. Event attendees will be part of a discussion about the future of consumer data in a new era of decentralized blockchain networks. Wibson CEO Mat Travizano and Santi Siri, founder of blockchain based @DemocracyEarth are part of the list of speakers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [https://wibson.org/](https://wibson.org/)\n\nWhitepaper : [https://wibson.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Wibson-Technical-Paper-v1.1.pdf](https://wibson.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Wibson-Technical-Paper-v1.1.pdf)\n\nBounty0x ID: ecamli",

Apart from the HARA Chain, he also spoke about the HARA Token Bridge, the HARA Block Explorer, the HARA Wallet, and the HARA Data Exchange itself.\n\nThe throughput on the Ethereum Main Net is around 1.5 transactions per second.\u00a0On the HARA Chain, this rises to 500 transactions per second.\u00a0Gilang continued his argument that apart from the number of transactions,\u00a0using HARA Chain also greatly reduces costs\u00a0as internal transactions are free, and the chain can be fully customized to suit HARA\u2019s needs.\n\n\n",

IPFS is a peer-to-peer protocol where each node stores a collection of hashed files.\n\nThe files that host the files are not known in the IPFS. Access to files is strictly hash-based. To prevent unauthorized access to data or abuse by its own IPFS host nodes, the stored data will be completely encrypted.\n\nEach user who views clips will donate a small portion of the processing power to mine Ethereum. They will be rewarded with cryptocurrencies to host content for longer periods. The Refine Medium is self-supporting. As more and more users are using the platform, more computing power will be available. The more it grows, the more node owners are motivated to store more data.",

With any developer just registering a smart contract with Link simply by providing his/her address and ABI where a set of standard API end points is generated by Link. Link is a tool applicable to every block chain enterprise as it removes the tedious and hard processes of block chain interaction.\n\nBlock chain from the point of view of most developers has a high difficulty to entry. It requires cryptography APIs and the nuances of esoteric decentralized systems. Also from the point of view of users, it is very much difficult to convince people to increase their DApp usage when it requires so many prerequisites, with the inclusion of Ethereum wallet, in which creation and usage is a problem. Storage of private keys safely and Meta mask are other problems encountered which discourages users. This part ways for the belief of black mason of \u201cfor an emerging technology to succeed, the users must be valued.\u201d Functionality, for too long has been ignored in the community of block chain, rather the community has gone for good technical development, financing and profit. This factors are good however, it doesn\u2019t create the perfect picture. Financing and profit have been raised above the bars which in most time has come to hinder mass adoption. This brought the focus of Link to value the functionality of the users through easy and simple block chain interaction.\n\nWebsite: [https://www.blockmason.link](https://www.blockmason.link/)",

They aim to build a large mining facility which will run as a service for their Mined Block Token (MBTX) holders. They will resolve the problem of gaining no profit from mining the top coins; due to electricity costs, by having access to locations where the prices of renewable energies are very low. Therefore they will increase the share of the mining. Also buying large volumes of mining hardware will also allow them to take the best discounts.\n\n75% of mining revenue will be distributed to our token holders relative to the number of tokens held (i.e. if you hold 1% of all circulating tokens, you will get 1% of the distributed revenue) Initially, minedblock will distribute Ethereum (ETH) to the wallet holding MBTX tokens.  \nMinedblock will use 10% of the revenue each month to expand the mining facilities. On a quarterly basis 5% of mining revenue for the period will be used to buy back tokens from the circulating supply to be destroyed. This activity will continue until the supply is reduced by at least 50%. The primary aim of the buy-back will be to reduce the supply and increase the \u2018return per token held\u2019 for our customers\nMinedBlock will utilise a mixture of ASIC units alongside Custom Built GPU Mining Rigs.

            "text": " \n\nIn partnership with Binance, Blockmason is excited to launch Blockmason Credit Protocol Token (BCPT) on Binance Chain, a blockchain software system developed by Binance and the community, and the forthcoming Binance Decentralized Exchange (DEX), as one of the first tokens to be available to users. Binance DEX is the decentralized exchange feature developed on top of the Binance Chain blockchain, offering low latency and high throughput with one-second block times and one-second confirmation finality.\n\nBCPT is a utility token which is required to enable the recording of data through the Credit Protocol to programmatic blockchains, such as Ethereum. As a developer of base-layer blockchain technologies, the Blockmason team is always looking for ways to expand the usability of our innovations. Launching BCPT on Binance Chain allows us to explore a new blockchain venue, assess the potential and suitability of cross-blockchain Credit Protocol transaction recording as well as the scaling of transaction capacity beyond what is currently capable on Ethereum. As Binance Chain grows, the Credit Protocol and BCPT will grow with it, presenting new opportunities for decentralized app developers and users alike.\n\nBinance DEX carries over the best features of Binance.com in a decentralized setting while offering the benefits and security of a DEX. On Binance DEX, users maintain control of private keys and funds, ushering in a new era of peer-to-peer trading. Listing BCPT on Binance DEX ensures that DApp developers and others who build Credit Protocol-powered DApps that interact with Binance Chain will be able to obtain BCPT for their needs.\n\nThe initial migration of BCPT from ERC20 to BEP2 will begin in the days following the Binance Chain mainnet launch. Once the 12-hour migration period has started, deposits and withdrawals of BCPT on Binance.com will be disabled until the process is complete. Once complete, Binance users will be able to withdraw BCPT to BEP2-compatible wallets. Note that ERC20 BCPT held in private wallets or on other exchanges will not be impacted.\n\nRead the full article here : [https://blockmason.io/binance-chain/](https://blockmason.io/binance-chain/)",

While the pricing model for Link is still in development, we intend to charge monthly subscription fees, API credit costs, or a combination of both. Developers and other Link customers can choose to pay these fees in one of two ways: using the Link utility token, or using a traditional payment method like a credit card.\n\nThe Link utility token is the required \"fuel\" that provides API transaction capacity in Link. If a Link user elects to pay their monthly subscription and usage fees with the Link utility token, a discount will be applied as Blockmason does not incur payment processing fees and other costs associated with credit card processing.\n\nIf the user instead pays with a credit card, Blockmason will use the revenue to acquire Link utility tokens on the user's behalf and apply them to their fees. Initially, these will be drawn from Blockmason's reserve inventory pool.\n\nAfter the reserve is depleted, Blockmason will acquire Link utility tokens on a pro-rata basis from all blockchains where the token is available at that time.\n\nRegardless of how a Link user pays for their usage and subscription fees, the resulting tokens will be locked and removed from the circulating supply until 30% of the tokens remain in circulation. Therefore, all Link utility tokens used to access or pay for the Link platform will be locked up at this initial stage, prior to reaching the 70% token supply lockup target.\n\nWhen the circulating token supply reaches the 70% lockup target, the functionality of the tokens will change to a membership model in the form of \"staking.\" The token will no longer be consumed when using Link services, providing Link utility token holders with Link platform access as long as they maintain their stake.\n\nBlockmason will conduct these supply removals on an ongoing basis, with regular reporting and independent audits. We are confident that this will provide transparency and visibility into how the Link utility token operates and allow any observer the chance to verify Link user growth and adoption metrics.\n\nAs Link is designed to support a variety of programmatic blockchains, the Link utility token will be minted with this in mind. Initially, Link will support the use of smart contracts on the Ethereum network. As such, 100% of the total Link utility token supply will be minted on the Ethereum network as ERC-20 compliant tokens. Link utility token support for alternate blockchains will be added in the future, in line with Link's development roadmap. When this occurs, Blockmason will act to reduce the ERC-20 token supply via lockup to ensure the total Link utility token supply across all blockchains remains constant.\n\nhttps://blockmason.link/",

Innately only a few are smart or lucky enough to make good money from breeding kittens, so we decided to add another opportunity for every user to earn from any ca or kitten they own.\n\nThere is a lot of undesirable cats held by users on the Cryptokitties platform wasting away unable to be sold for profit. KittieFight provides the opportunity for these to be used in earning cash or burned in their sink or Euthanasia called kittieHELL.\n\n\u201cThe Idea behind kittiefight is for two players to schedule two opposing cats in a fighting march against each other with their respective fans supporting them, just like in a boxing match with fans,\u201d he comments.\n\nThe match is moderated by smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain and contains a pool or \u201choneypot\u201d of Ethereum Eth (digital cash) and kittieFight tokens, that the winner of the fight gets to claim a portion/percentage of. The losing opponent/cat is locked up in another smart contract forever, without the ability to be claimed or used again unless a fee payable in the KittieFight tokens is made. Every fight scheduled requires a scheduling fee payable in KittieFight tokens.\n\nThe two players send Ethereum transactions to a smart contract representing the fighting algorithm, and this results in punches and other forms of attacks on the cats.\n\n\u201cSupporters of each kitty actually bet on their champion using eth, which is collected into the honeypot. The top and highest of the last supporters betting eth get a share of the honeypot (Ethereum Eth cash and KittieFight tokens). Minimal share of the honeypot goes to a few runner-ups. This creates an attrition model where players hope to be last of the highest bettors in order to win the pot.",

IPFS is a peer-to-peer protocol where each node  \nstores a collection of hashed files. A client who wants to retrieve any of those files can access an  \nabstraction layer where it simply needs to call the hash of the file it wants. IPFS then iterates through the  \nnodes and supplies the client with the file. The original content (the stream or video/audio file) is split up into  \nsmall segments before being uploaded to the IPFS network. This allows us to distribute storage further and  \nnot load any particular node with all data of the file. The hashes of these files will be stored in a  \nmanifest file which will be uploaded to the Ethereum network. It can be retrieved securely while maintaining  \nits integrity at a later stage when a video playback is requested. While streaming the video on the  \nplatform, the small manifest file will be downloaded initially. Hashes from this manifest will be used to  \ndownload the required segments of the video (which the user chooses to play). These segments will be  \nspliced together to create a continuous stream on the fly.  \nData stored on IPFS cannot be modified. The hash will correspond to the same file forever. Even if a node  \nserving our file goes down, other nodes will provide the same file if the same hash is provided. If a video  \nuploaded to the platform is changed, it gets a new hash and thus, will be available as a new file. Two  \nmethods can be adopted concerning the old file:  \n\u2022If the creator doesn\u2019t want the old file to be available, all instances of the hash to the old  \nfile will be removed so that it effectively becomes inaccessible.  \n\u2022A versioning system can be enabled if the content creator wants so. In this case the old  \nhash is also preserved making the older version accessible. Each viewer can then  \nanalyze the entire history of evolution.",

While the pricing model for Link is still in development, we intend to chargemonthly subscription fees, API credit costs, or a combination of both. Developers and other Link customers canchoose to pay these fees in one of two ways: using the Link utility token, or using a traditional payment method likea credit card.The Link utility token is the required \"fuel\" that provides API transaction capacity in Link. If a Link user electsto pay their monthly subscription and usage fees with the Link utility token, a discount will be applied asBlockmason does not incur payment processing fees and other costs associated with credit card processing.If the user instead pays with a credit card, Blockmason will use the revenue to acquire Link utility tokens on theuser's behalf and apply them to their fees. Initially, these will be drawn from Blockmason's reserve inventory pool.After the reserve is depleted, Blockmason will acquire Link utility tokens on a pro-rata basis from all blockchainswhere the token is available at that time.Regardless of how a Link user pays for their usage and subscription fees, the resulting tokens will be locked andremoved from the circulating supply until 30% of the tokens remain in circulation. Therefore, all Link utility tokensused to access or pay for the Link platform will be locked up at this initial stage, prior to reaching the 70% tokensupply lockup target.When the circulating token supply reaches the 70% lockup target, the functionality of the tokens will change to amembership model in the form of \"staking.\" The token will no longer be consumed when using Link services,providing Link utility token holders with Link platform access as long as they maintain their stake.Blockmason will conduct these supply removals on an ongoing basis, with regular reporting and independentaudits. We are confident that this will provide transparency and visibility into how the Link utility token operates andallow any observer the chance to verify Link user growth and adoption metrics.As Link is designed to support a variety of programmatic blockchains, the Link utility token will beminted with this in mind. Initially, Link will support the use of smart contracts on the Ethereumnetwork. As such, 100% of the total Link utility token supply will be minted on the Ethereum network asERC-20 compliant tokens. Link utility token support for alternate blockchains will be added in thefuture, in line with Link's development roadmap. When this occurs, Blockmason will act to reduce theERC-20 token supply via lockup to ensure the total Link utility token supply across all blockchainsremains constant.",

Then our Software reads the Snapshot info to calculate the distribution and automatically sends the corresponding Ethereum to all the Holders. \n\nFor each **ORET Tokens** Holder to receive their profits, their ORET Tokens must be stored in an ERC-20 wallet with their own private key (myetherwallet, metamask, etc.) ORET Tokens must not be in an Exchange on the day of the Snapshot.\n\n[https://www.oretoken.io/](https://www.oretoken.io/)",

            "text": " \n\nGemstra is leveling the playing field in the social selling market by empowering the often overlooked people who do the majority of the legwork, the sellers. Sellers, or brand ambassadors, in social selling are the people who are passionate about a brand, and leverage their own social networks to sell the product. Up until now, they haven\u2019t always been given a fair deal. They have traditionally operated at the mercy of large companies that control them.\n\nAccording to Gemstra, \u201ctoo much of consumer value has been displaced to monolith search, display, and ad networks. We believe that the fragmented transaction layers in the social selling economy today are redundant, excessive, opaque, and unfair.\u201d\n\nJust as Robinhood famously took from the rich and gave to the poor, Gemstra and it\u2019s ASTRA Platform aim to take away power from the large companies and redistribute that power to the people (the sellers)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ncfcxd010ir21.jpg?width=1796&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e3f82cbd653df7315adb3aade03037a267248e44\n\n**ABOUT GEMSTRA**\n\nGemstra is dedicated to making social selling experience worthwhile by rewarding sellers that promote brands on their various social network, this will go a long way in putting an end to social market that has been undervalued for a very long time.\n\nBelow is a video of the ICO presentation by the project CEO **Jay Cheng** during the CryptoEconomy London 2018.\n\nGemstra will make this possible through a blockchain integrated system (ASTRA) which gives sellers full control to their customers data and transaction records and also token economy (GMS token) to unleash social selling to the retail market. They said they would be traded on the Cobinhood exchange.\n\nThe global retail economy is valued at $24 trillion and GEMTSRA is looking forward to allowing these retailers join the social selling and restore power back to the producers, this I would say is just the perfect platform needed by stakeholders of social selling. They are progressing successfully\n\nThe dominance of social selling is mainly by some few giants which frustrates most sellers by making customers and transaction data difficult to access.\n\n* Gemstra is hosting its smart contract using ERC20 standard on ethereum blockchain and makes data storage through Interplanetary File System (IPFS).\n* Management of brand inventory and logistics through Spl.yt protocol.\n* Purchasing of GMS token using Ox protocol on decentralized exchanges for rewards.\n\n**TOKEN INFORMATION**\n\n**Symbol:** GMS\n\n**Token Type :** Ethereum ERC-20 Compatible\n\n**Total allocation for sale:** 6,400,000,000 GMS\n\n**Token Price:** $0.01 USD\n\n**Decimals:** 18\n\n**CONCLUSION** \n\nGemstra project is blockchain based and which also runs on smart contracts and GMS token to improve the ecosystem of social selling which will serve as mode of payment, commission, governance and rewards for the ASTRA platform.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**For more information, please visit:**\n\nWebsite: [https://gemstra.com/](https://gemstra.com/)\n\nWhitepaper: [https://docsend.com/view/xvyqq7a](https://docsend.com/view/xvyqq7a)\n\nANN Thread: [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4713980.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4713980.0)\n\nFacebook: [https://m.facebook.com/gemstraofficial](https://m.facebook.com/gemstraofficial)\n\nTwitter: [https://mobile.twitter.com/gemstraofficial](https://mobile.twitter.com/gemstraofficial)\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/gemstra](https://t.me/gemstra)\n\nReddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Gemstra/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gemstra/)\n\nMedium: [https://medium.com/gemstra](https://medium.com/gemstra)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBounty0x Username: **sakaleyn**",

            "text": "**Properties and Usapes of Token**\n\nThe native dig ital cryptog raphically secured utility token of the QuarkChain Network (QKC) is a major component of the ecosystem on the QuarkChain Network, and is desig ned to be used solely as the primary token on the network. QKC will initially be issued by the Distributor as ERC-20 standard compliant dig itat tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, and these will be mig rated to tokens on the blockchain of the QuarkChain Network when the same is eventually launched. As discussed above, the main goal of the QuarkChain Network is to solve scalability problem of the current blockchain based systems.\n\nQKC is a non-refundable functional utility token which will be used as the unit of exchange between participants on the QuarkChain Network. The goal of introducing QKC is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem on the QuarkChain Network. QKC does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in the Foundation, its affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor will QKC entitle token holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction. QKC may only be utilised on the QuarkChain Network, and ownership of QKC carries no rig hts, express or implied, other than the right to use QKC as a means to enable usage of and interaction with the QuarkChain Network.\n\nThe key application scenarios of the QuarkChain Network will focus on financial tech areas and game industries. The Token of the QuarkChain Network (QKC) will play very important roles, as the medium of exchange for the QuarkChain Network. There are several detaited areas of application for QKC. \n\n  \n\n**Value carrier**\n\nThe essence of the virtual currency is the value carrier, which is the most important attribute of QKC.\n\n**Transaction currency**\n\nQKC is required as virtual crypto \"fuel\" for using certain desig ned functions on the QuarkChain Network, providing the economic incentives which will be consumed to encourage participants to contribute and maintain the ecosystem on the QuarkChain Network. Computational resources are required for running various applications and executing transactions on the QuarkChain Network, as well as the validation and verification of additional blocks / information on the blockchain, thus providers of these services / resources would require payment for the consumption of these resources (i.e. \"mining\" on the QuarkChain Network) to maint a in network integrity, and QKC will be used as the unit of exchange to quantify and pay the costs of the consumed computational resources.\n\nSimilar to Ethereum, each transaction on the QuarkChain Network needs to pay transaction fee. Since the QuarkChain Network has powerful transaction processing capability, transaction fee will be very low. Transaction fee only can be pa id by QKC. The QuarkChain Network supports smart contracts. A smart contract transaction of the QuarkChain Network is completed by sending a message to the contract add ress.\n\nContribution incentives\n\nAs a peer-to-peer system, using economic means to produce positive feed back can promote the continuous development of the system. QKC will be distributed as incentives to incentivise the community to make continuous contributions towards the system. Users of the QuarkChain Network and/or holders of QKC which did not actively participate will not receive any QKC incentives.\n\nQKC is an integ ral and indispensable part of the QuarkChain Network, because without QKC, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on the QuarkC ha in Network.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

They have just announced the launch of their mobile app referred to as the Wibson token (WIB), plus the new data platform that is in Spain, UK, and Argentina.\n\n### More On The Company\n\nThe company has been able to support the consumer\u2019s ability to sell personal data to the different data buyers in the market; this is from advertisers, technology firms, marketers, data for the social good research, plus academics. In the platform's marketplace, the consumers have been given the free will in deciding who and when they can sell their personal data, which has been based on transparent and market-driven offers.\n\nThe offers presented clearly outline the kind of data that is being requested, the intended use of the [collected data](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/blockchain-cybersecurity-can-distributed-ledger-technology-help-secure-data/), price, plus the data for the buyer. Previously the company has been able to receive some funding from DGG Capital, Telefonica\u2019s investment arm, Kenetic Capital, Wayra and many more.\n\nAccording to the CEO and the co-founder of *Wibson*, Mat Travizano, consumer data has been considered to be the world\u2019s most valuable asset. Thus, the platform has been created to provide the consumers with an easy way they could profit from the data that they are able to develop each day. All this has been made possible while still asserting the ownership over their personal data.\n\nBut this is not all as the platform will also offer the data buyers direct access to the consumers validated data and also receive an explicit consent to use it in full transparency in market-based transactions.\n\nAccording to the Chief Data Officer of the Telefonica, Thema Alonso, he states that data has been able to fuel growth for the big companies that are around the globe, but with the new model entering the market scene, like Wibson, they are slowly reshaping this space.\n\nThere are a few developments that are taking place around the personal data arena; thus, Wibson has gone ahead to build a very impressive team that will be focused on the future when the consumers will be demanding control on their data.\n\n \n\nThe Wibson Marketplace Has Three Types Of Participants\n\n\u2022 The first is the data sellers \u2013 These are individuals who are looking to make some extra profit from their personal data in a transparent and trusted space one that is a market-driven environment.\n\n\u2022 The Data buyers \u2013 These are entities plus various businesses; the likes of the good social researchers, academics who are looking to purchase some authentic and validated data.\n\n\u2022 The Notaries \u2013 These are the organizations that are able to validate and verify the personal data that has been presented by the buyers in the platform. To ensure the buyers get accurate information, they also arbitrate any disputes that might arise during transactions.\n\nThe interaction that takes place within these three roles has been carefully governed by the use of smart contracts in the Wibson market. The contracts are deployed on the [Ethereum blockchain](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/ethereum/).\n\nThe benefit of the Wibson platform is that the data for the sellers will remain on their own devices until the moment they decide to sell it. And at this moment is when their encrypted data is directly encrypted to the data buyers on the platform. The company has ensured they are not responsible for the seller\u2019s data as they don\u2019t receive or store it, just to ensure the sellers have complete control.\n\nThis is not all as the platform has been designed to ensure it is able to orchestrate the transactions taking place in a transparent manner. Plus, the offers made on the platform properly outline how the seller's data will be used. As soon as a transaction has been confirmed through the companies blockchain managed [smart contract](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/top-6-most-popular-blockchain-smart-contracts-use-cases-and-applications/), the sellers will receive a direct and secure payment through the company app.\n\nMore information\n\n [https://wibson.org/](https://wibson.org/) \n\n bounty0x ID : hllelek33 ",

The BLINK TGE will be held on Bitsonic starting on Monday, March 18, 2019.\n\nBLINK is the official utility token powering Blockmason Link, a new blockchain infrastructure-as-a-service that allows app, web and other software developers to use smart contracts and programmatic blockchains like Ethereum, TRON, EOS, GoChain and others in their applications without requiring any blockchain experience. Using Link, a developer can create classic, conventional web-based APIs for any smart contract written on a programmatic blockchain.\n\n>**\u201cWe are excited to partner with Bitsonic, one of the premier digital asset exchanges in Korea, to host our TGE for BLINK,\u201d said Michael Chin, Chief Executive Officer of Blockmason. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to making BLINK available to software developers, startups and others interested in the incredible innovations that Link will bring to the blockchain technology space.\u201d**\n\nLink is viewed as the missing component in blockchain-based app development. With Link, developers and users alike can interact with smart contracts like any other web API. There are no \u201cgas\u201d cryptocurrencies to acquire, browser plugins to install or other unnecessary hurdles. There\u2019s also no servers or web infrastructure to maintain or monitor. A developer simply adds the smart contracts they want to use in their app to Link. Once added, they can read from and write to these smart contracts just like any other API.\n\n[https://blockmason.link/](https://blockmason.link/)",

The companies of this company have been part of the business and investment area for decades.\n\nIf we take into consideration the fact that traders in traditional markets are gradually turning to the crypto money exchanges, we can conclude that the problems in existing crypto money exchanges should be eliminated. To put it briefly, there is a need for a stock exchange platform that will provide the transparency required by the institutional investors in the market. This platform must also be able to cope with the **VOLUM** of crypto-money transactions that are being carried out today.\n\n**VOLUM**, a hybrid crypto  platform, has the potential to solve all these problems and meet the needs. Thanks to the **Volum** mapping engine located in the center of the stock market, the speed of the transactions in the platform is increasing. This platform is revolutionary and provides companies with more organization and surveillance capabilities than they had before. This gives **VOLUM** traders a variety of options across multiple companies and sectors.\n\nUnlike international crypto-money platforms that hold leadership in the market, the Volum platform draws the attention as a crypto money exchange based on a high-performance infrastructure.\n\nThe **Volum** platform, which offers the critical features required by the crypto money exchanges to its users, makes a difference in the market. The platform will bring the sectoral infrastructure of traditional exchanges to the users through a decentralized network.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VOLUM** offers logistics and supply chain solutions to various industries. **Volum** maximizes investment value and stability with its holding company structure. **VOLUM** has a structure that minimizes risks by design, enabling rapid access to economies of scale with a robust infrastructure. With B2B, the chances of success of market operations are increased. While the opportunity to make mistakes is reduced with extensive data analysis, the efficiency obtained from services is augmented with IoT technology.\n\n**VOLUM**, a decentralized logistics, and supply chain technology platform makes investments in portfolio management companies. Maximizes productivity and competitive advantage by taking advantage of volume.The VOLUM'e ecosystem based on blockchain infrastructure has been built on the Ethereum network. The fact that companies will need too many smart contracts by choosing the **VOLUM** ecosystem network has not been ignored. Therefore, the software company Associates Inc.is a subsidiary of **VOLUM** holding. In other areas, as an energy company,\n\nRescue Systems Corporation, Acme Finance Services, grid power network, and ISGB, which is an international alcohol and beverage group, will generate income from operations outside the company's dividend. **VOLUM** will monitor the investments made to the portfolio companies for the duration of the retention period and will act as an investment company. The platform consisting of a successful and experienced leadership team will invest in promising products and services. Value gains in investment companies will cause the company's indicator VLM to gain value.\n\nWith the **Volum** blockchain platform, companies can monitor, direct, identify and source all data activities in the supply chain.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eolqyvbcd7x21.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd4a97b8d717d3d733f3f98aa401e3485a647bfc\n\n**Volum** blockchain platform operates as the only central location for your business supply chain operation. Companies using this platform can perform a wide range of block chain operations, including:\n\nBlockchain uses technology with an ecosystem specifically developed for farmers, manufacturers, distributors, utilities, administrative agencies, financial institutions and IoT databases. **Volum** has developed a Blockchain framework that transforms traditional paperwork into digital processes and secures all transactions in the company'S business.\n\nMoreover, businesses can easily access all functionality from a single dashboard - so they can monitor and track business data, see intelligent contracts, and control the progress of the entire supply chain.\n\nFull transparency offers full security and simplifies workflow by enabling businesses to set up a \u201cmonitoring and monitoring\u201d platform using smart contracts and block chain approvals.\n\n**VLM** jet will be used on the Volum ecosystem. The platform will use two token types with different standards on the Ethereum network. The first will have a technical standard for self-execution of smart contracts that will have the ERC20 standard. Those with the erc71 standard are uniquely created tokens. Although there is a value such as ERC20, the ERC71 represents only one value; therefore it is unique.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n**VOLUM** has the qualifications to meet the demands of the crypto money community; offers a fast, high performance and secure service experience. The service offered by the platform brings together the features of traditional exchanges and blockchain technology. The platform, which is scheduled to continue to be tested during this month, aims to ensure that professionals in corporate crypto exchanges participate in the crypto economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TEAM:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cru5dy3fd7x21.jpg?width=763&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e55a2c00bf4cc20751cc40c8ba103698aa689fc\n\n**Token Structure and ICO Information**\n\nToken: VLMPlatform:\n\nEthereumType: ERC20Pre\n\nICO price: 1 VLM = 0.28\n\nUSDPrice in ICO: 0.3500\n\nUSD Tokens for sale: 236,800,000\n\nSoft cap: 1 Million USD\n\nHard cap: 74.6 Million USD\n\nWebsite: [https://volum.io/](https://volum.io/)\n\nWhitepaper: [https://volum.io/assets/images/volum-whitepaper.pdf](https://volum.io/assets/images/volum-whitepaper.pdf)\n\nbounty0x username: arifcakir13",

The platform keeps those entry fees if the player fails, and pays them out (based on predefined odds) if they succeed. The challenges will be set up to be difficult enough that succeeding is rare, but rewarding enough that players have a compelling reason to play. Arena Match will dynamically adjust the payout rates on a per-player basis based on that player\u2019s skill history to ensure that challenges remain persistently difficult while keeping the payouts appropriately fair and compelling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Highscore Tournaments**: Players can compete in regularly scheduled (hourly/daily/weekly) leader board tournaments for specific games with the goal of achieving a high score payout. Before each tournament begins, the prize pool is set and the number of paid out positions is determined (these numbers will fluctuate based on historic metrics, anticipated entrants/entry fees, and the platform\u2019s overall success). Once the tournament begins, players will be able to enter at-will, paying an entry fee which grants them an opportunity to play a match whose score will be recorded on the leader board. Until the tournament ends, players may make multiple entries into the tournament (paying a separate entry fee each time) to attempt to post a better score (using their best score to establish their rank). The entry fees for each additional attempt progressively become less expensive, creating a compelling reason for players to re-up multiple times. At the tournament\u2019s conclusion, players with qualifying high scores will be paid out according to the best rank they\u2019ve achieved. The tournaments will be structured in a way where the total entry fees collected will exceed the total in prize pool payouts, creating a positive revenue stream for Arena Match.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**INITIAL EXCHANGE OFFERING OVERVIEW** \n\nAMG Token Information\n\nToken: Arena Match Gold\n\nSymbol: AMG\n\nProtocol: ERC-20 Ethereum Network\n\nDecimals: 18\n\nSoft-cap: 5 million AMG to be Sold / Swapped\n\nHard-cap: 75 million AMG to be Sold / Swapped\n\nMinimum Contribution: 0.1 ETH\n\nStarting IEO Rate: 1 AMG per 0.0005 ETH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhitepaper: [https://arenamatch.com/whitepaper/](https://arenamatch.com/whitepaper/)\n\nWebsite: [https://arenamatch.com](https://arenamatch.com)",

Blockchain-based tokens will enable crowdfunding and provide trackable, transparent payments with seamless fiat conversion. Meanwhile, NeoVM will also be used to grant [digital rights management](https://www.bitrates.com/news/p/sony-aims-to-protect-digital-content-rights-with-a-blockchain-patent) to artists and other music industry participants.  \n\n\nThe project arises from long-standing concerns distributors are taking more than their fair share of the profits. iMusify notes that streaming services such as Itunes and Spotify are receiving most of [the royalties](https://twitter.com/imusify/status/1033751683141181445)from current streaming activity, while artists are left with pennies.  \n\n\nAlthough iMusify is positive it can change this, the platform has plenty of competition: Itunes and Spotify currently dominate the streaming market. Blockchain-based competitors are also on the rise, including Ujo Music, Choon, and Current.\n\nHowever, iMusify may have a broader appeal than other blockchain startups. It aims to be a seamless experience and is not pushing blockchain for the sake of pushing blockchain. In other words, to most users, it will be just another app. According to one interview:\n\n>If what you\u2019re selling is something universally loved and understood, people won\u2019t even know they\u2019re using a [decentralized application](https://www.bitrates.com/guides/ethereum/what-is-dapp-how-does-it-work)...you don\u2019t have to learn anything new if you don\u2019t want to, and you\u2019ll still be helping artists. / [Nate Strang](https://medium.com/imusify/the-imusi-why-series-community-q-a-with-imusify-coo-nate-strang-and-tom-chilli-of-chillit-68576c5a0a9), iMusify COO  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>[https://imusify.com/](https://imusify.com/)  \n>  \n>[https://imusify.com/whitepaper.pdf](https://imusify.com/whitepaper.pdf)",

The project notes that competitors are very dependent on the inefficient of Ethereum network, on which they operate.

Instead of facing the challenges of hosting their own nodes or the hassles of using Infura, developers may now connect to\u00a0the blockchain using Link\u2019s web APIs, creating a\u00a0blockchain-powered application in minutes. For further comparison to\u00a0existing infrastructure services, including Infura, see \u201cThe Next Step in Managed Infrastructure\u201d below. Link also features multi-chain support, for DApp developers that desire connectivity on many chains without the hassle of supporting each chain in turn. Developers may rapidly launch an\u00a0application on all platforms with nodes hosted by Blockmason, without having to\u00a0code in anything other than JavaScript. It\u2019s the easiest possible way to\u00a0develop a\u00a0decentralized application. \n\n \u2014 Hybrid Deployment \n\n With Link, it is finally possible to\u00a0run web services alongside Ethereum-based blockchain services. While this has near limitless applications, a\u00a0simple and familiar example would be a\u00a0hybrid-blockchain authentication or authorization service. By delegating certain tasks to\u00a0the Ethereum network, developers can utilize blockchain only for those aspects of the product which benefit from added decentralization, all while having a\u00a0UI that is completely indistinguishable from other non-blockchain applications. \n\n&#x200B;",

After the consortium chain has grown sufficiently (1,000 TPS for 10,000-20,000 active user networks), it is difficult to predict in the near future because the initial nodes will be supported by Cloud VMs and will be derived from the calculation power provided by the users . \n\nThe VOLUM Oracle node will begin receiving the Volum tokens from mainnet to the Volum tokens within the consortium chain. VOLUM will avoid the speed limitations of the Ethereum and will reduce the gas price as it will be calculated differently (the time to exceed the average transaction execution in seconds by means of SC's average transaction prices / average transaction multiplication). Building the system on the Ethereum Mainnet requires operational costs and processing speed is limited to 20-25 processes per second, creating a huge problem for users. For this reason, the VOLUM platform is an optimal solution of a hybrid system capable of computation on the Ethereum Mainnet side of the Ethereum coded Ethereum. \n\nWhen a user signs an agreement (smart contract), he / she receives an appropriate ERC721 coin issued by an intelligent contract that stores all the information required for the proof of the VOLUM platform. Data will also be stored in VOLUM's external storage infrastructure, and mixed data will be stored in a volume smart agreement on the block chain, which uses SHA-256 for data encryption. Converts some fixed length values to a random set of data that serves as a descriptive function for verifying and signing digital security certificates and documents. \n\nThe resulting value cannot be obtained, such as copy source data. This means that you will not be able to read, modify, or delete data from blockchain. Each ERC721 token also stores all geographical path point data. Therefore, both the consumer and the customer have equal access to all information related to an agreement. In addition, in VOLUM, we have made sure that users can insure their offers automatically by placing a check mark in compliance with the smart contract. This insurance feature has been developed and an appropriate smart contract has been made. Cost will be included in the transaction.\n\n[VOLUM Website](https://volum.io/)\n\n[VOLUM Whitepaper](https://volum.io/wp-content/themes/volum/images/volum-whitepaper.pdf)\n\nBounty0x username: demirci",

They are required to seek sponsors or sponsees manually.\nWe propose a Net Sponsorship Asset (NSA) as a unit that sponsors are willing to pay for in\nsponsorship business. This unit is backed by the attention of the audience/clients of sponsee.\nWe enable sponsees to issue their own Sponsy-backed tokens, assign them to sponsorship\nassets, and subsequently sell the assets to sponsors. This reduces the time and efforts required\nto conduct a sponsorship deal and allows sponsee to receive sponsorship funding from multiple\nsponsors simultaneously.\n\n\nWhile traditional sponsorship agencies spend long months carrying out sponsorship deals,\nour automated approach will allow sponsees to issue their tokens in a matter of minutes and\nstart selling them to sponsors available on our platform.\nAll the sponsorship-related information, including previous deals, other sponsors\u2019 reviews,\nintellectual property rights and licenses, is stored on Ethereum blockchain, thus enabling\npotential sponsors to track the history of each sponsorship asset.\nSponsy intends to cater to the untapped market of SME sponsorships by imposing no\nrestrictions on companies that are willing to join Sponsy. https://www.sponsy.org/",

From a\u00a0user perspective, the published decentralized application will be no different from any other typical application, even though it\u2019s really blockchain-powered...and that\u2019s just cool.\n\n\u00a02. Managed High-Availability Infrastructure With Blockmason Link, you don't need any other infrastructure in order for people to\u00a0start using a\u00a0decentralized application. Developers must only deploy their smart contract, create their app in Blockmason Link, and they\u2019re done. No servers to\u00a0maintain or infrastructure to\u00a0monitor etc. Find out more on:\n\nhttps://blockmason.link/\n\nhttps://blockmason.link/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Blockmason_Link_Whitepaper.pdf\n\n",

            "text": " \n\nINTRODUCTION TO ESPORTS\n\neSports might be the fastest growing sport in the world with great advantages. It doesn't have to be played in-person; it can be played anytime, and anyone can play. There are no limitations. It is a world of freedom that adapts to an individual need. eSports, by definition, is competitive gaming at a professional level in an organized format with a specific goal and a clear distinction between players that are competing against each other. What makes eSports so appealing? It is the fact that the success of a player is completely independent of his physical attributes and skills. Two completely different players can both excel in the game field, regardless of gender, culture or location. It is a place that connects everyone who loves gaming in any way\n\nOPPORTUNITY\n\nThe number of gamers worldwide in 2017 was up to 2.2 billion worldwide across all platforms, and in the year before there were only around 13K professional gamers in the world. The procentage of professional gamers is therefore as small as 0,0006%. Which means there is a massive number of amateur gamers that do not get the chance to make money from their gaming skills. That void will be fiiled with the BetOnYourself platform. Non-professional eSports players will get a chance to make a financial profit from their gaming skills. Their time could be well spent, not just in a sense of having fun.\n\nVISION\n\nBUSINESS PROFITABILITY\n\nBased on current player count data, our potential target goal in the first year of business is 1% of the market. The estimated earnings will, therefore, be calculated based on this percent.On the average we estimate that one player will bet 2.5$ and one game session between 2 players will have a joint bet amount of 5$. On average, a player plays 3 games per gaming session.\n\nOur provision on each game session is 10% or 5% if the players are using our token iBET.\n\nMy view on gaming has changed a lot since I was little, playing Duck Hunt on a console. In my early childhood, I played Super Mario, Duke Nukem, different sports games and others. Then there were some CSI games and SIMS, and that was it for me for an extended period of time. I had a short phase of poker and online casino games, and then I met my husband, a passionate gamer, and everything changed. I was sucked into the life of gaming and game development, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\n\nI was always an artist \u2014 I grew up drawing, painting and creating art in general. This brought me to graphic design, and now I am a mixture of a designer by hobby, a journalist by education and marketer by occupation. My husband and I created the mobile game Zombie Watch, which has more than 4 million downloads across all platforms. The idea of game creation was a natural progression; we both enjoy spending time playing games, and our professions match up perfectly for a team of game developers. It has been one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life, and I am very proud of the outcome. When the idea of gaming for money was presented to me for the first time by Mitja and \u017diga with the BetOnYourself platform, I was very excited about the project. It is the perfect development for the gaming world and a chance for many hobby gamers to make a living out of their dreams. Esports have been taking the world by storm for the last few years, and this is the natural next step.\n\nBased on this figures we estimate:\n\nAn annual market volume of 280 million challenges\n\nAn average platform transaction fee of 0.25$ per single challenge\n\nTOTAL annual fee income of $105 million based on average between both fee amounts, 5% and 10%.\n\nThe iBET token will be issued on the Ethereum blockchain using a smart contract defined by the ERC-20 standard and will be more than just a payment option; it will be in charge of the whole ecosystem of the BetOnYourself platform\n\niBET PRICE AND TOKEN SUPPLY\n\nSYMBOL: iBET\n\nTOTAL iBET TOKEN SUPPLY (100 %): 2 bilion iBET\n\nTOTAL iBET TOKEN SUPPLY FOR SALE (75 %): 1.5 bilion iBET\n\nOFFERED TOKEN EXCHANGE RATE: 1 iBET = 0.01 USD\n\nETH/USD EXCHANGE RATE: 1 ETH = Price will be fixed on the day of crowdsale\n\nPUBLIC CROWDSALE DATE: To be announced\n\nSOFT CAP:1.000,000 USD\n\nHARD CAP: 15.000,000 USD\n\nMINIMUM CONTRIBUTION: 1 ETH\n\nMAXIMUM CONTRIBUTION: 100 ETH\n\nUNSOLD CROWDSALE TOKENS WILL BE BURNED\n\nInitial Token Distribution Date: 7 days after ICO completion\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: https://www.betonyourself.io/\n\nWhitepaper: https://www.betonyourself.io/pdf/Betonyourself%20Whitepaper.pdf\n\nBounty0x ID: ecamli",

The tech event featured an\u00a0international panel of speakers, including HARA\u2019s CTO, Imron Zuhri, and Sr Blockchain Developer, Arkan Gilang.\n\nIn his presentation, Gilang spoke about\u00a0the new products HARA was revealing\u00a0and how they would work in the HARA ecosystem. Apart from the HARA Chain, he also spoke about the HARA Token Bridge, the HARA Block Explorer, the HARA Wallet, and the HARA Data Exchange itself.\n\nThe throughput on the Ethereum Main Net is around 1.5 transactions per second.\u00a0On the HARA Chain, this rises to 500 transactions per second.\u00a0Gilang continued his argument that apart from the number of transactions,\u00a0using HARA Chain also greatly reduces costs\u00a0as internal transactions are free, and the chain can be fully customized to suit HARA\u2019s needs.  \n[https://haratoken.io](https://haratoken.io/)",

Recently blockchain technology has been used to distribute electricity in Thailand. All economic sectors, especially in the agricultural sector, will use Blockchain technology. one of the haratoken platforms that want to use blockchain technology to revolutionize the agricultural sector. At the blokchain Conference in southeastasia in Jakarta, they will socialize Haratoken as an alternative solution in the agricultural sector. \n\n Indonesia is a fertile country to produce rice, there are many problems in all industries that make the agricultural sector in Indonesia unable to compete with other countries. from poor land use and the data they use is wrong, so rice production in the agricultural sector decreases. Haratoken wants to use blockchain technology in all agricultural sectors using the important data they collect from the field. such as the quality of the land, the price of wheat, and the ownership of farmers' land. all field agents will help farmers to increase annual yields. \n\nWhat are HARA tokens?  \nTokens based on ERC-20, a platform built on the ethereum blockchain, for use in the agricultural sector that can monitor all data obtained from farmers.\n\nThe main purpose  \nTo create an economy in data exchange, if farmers enter data on the blockchain, farmers will get prizes from the data they enter on the Haratoken platform and HARA tokens can be exchanged for some items they need such as fertilizer etc. They will also get knowledge of agricultural data obtained from other farmers and can also monitor prices on the market.\n\nData obtained by Haratoken from farmers will also benefit the government and NGOs. At present, the economic system in the agricultural sector is on the verge of being critical. with the exchange of data stored on blockchain technology, the problems that occur today in all agricultural industries can be monitored in real time by the government.\n\n Haratoken provides important data that will increase productivity to reduce losses caused by wrong practices in the agricultural sector. by using data stored on the blockchain, productivity management in the agricultural sector can be handled effectively. \n\n Haratoken also launched a mobile application in 2017 that makes it easier for farmers to access data, anywhere and anytime. Last month Haratoken had reached 7,000 farmers and their hopes in 2020 could reach 2 million farmers throughout Indonesia. they will also penetrate in other sectors that can bring changes to the economic sector of the community. Currently, Hara has succeeded in obtaining land, weather, farmers and KYC data throughout Indonesia. all data can be viewed on the Haratoken platform.\n\nHaratoken wrote on their website about Haratoken's success in revolutionizing the agricultural sector, they had worked with several banks and other financial institutions that could provide loans to small farmers. for platforms that use blockchain technology, this is the biggest breakthrough in driving the economy of Indonesian farmers, even farmers around the world. just counting time, haratoken will spread throughout the world.\n\n Currently the Hara tokens are sold in the form of ERC-20, you can buy them on the Haratoken website:\n\n\\*\\*Token Utility \\*\\*  \nToken name: HARA  \nToken Symbol: HART  \nToken Type: ERC20  \nTotal Token Supply : 1,200,000,000  \nTokens For Sale : 360,000,000\n\nThey will also have the opportunity to explain about heratoken. There are many great speakers who will gather at the Southeast Asia Summit event in Jakarta.\n\nWebsite: [https://haratoken.io/](https://haratoken.io/)",

This token is meant to serve as the major driver of the CATEX ecosystem. CATT is used for several purposes such as:\n\nCATT is the token given back to users as bonus for trading on the platformIt is the coin traders mine on the CATEX platformPayment for other rewards and incentives on the platform\n\nBENEFITS OF TOKEN TO HOLDERS\n\nIn holding CATT there are some great benefits attached to it, such as: Holders of CATT are the only users permitted to enjoy dividend shared by the Exchange. And a user must hold at least 200 CATT in his account to be entitled to this benefit.Due to the fact that the price of token is controlled, Holders are bound to make good profits from their investments.CATEX token burn program has helped the total supply to reduce from the initial amount of 10b last year to about 2b token presently. This is good news to holders as the value is increasing.\n\nCATEX has introduced a buyback program where CATT is bought back by the team and kept in a special wallet whenever the need arises. The lock time introduced by CATEX is also one of the strategies to add value to the token.It will interest you to know that holders are paid dividends according to the amount of their locked tokens and a lot of holders want to earn more rewards, therefore they lock a high amount of tokens and this significantly reduced the circulating amount of CATT token.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [https://www.catex.io/](https://www.catex.io/)",

            "text": " \n\n### The Betbox\u00a0Platform\n\nGood day to everyone in this article I\u2019m focusing on Betbox Platform about their OX-token, Events, and Program that participants can interact and participate within the platform. This not the First program that conducts betting, gambling, using smart contract, but I think there are some features that are unique. I will not compare it to other betting platforms that I know. I just want to say to every reader of my article how this platform will perform in online betting and how OX token will be valuable for the operation.\n\n**About betbox platform**\n\nFirst, betbox platform ecosystem is fully decentralized. Their core is built on the Ethereum Public mainnet so obviously, their token will be an ERC 20 token compliant. Their business model is based on social interaction. So in betbox platform users compete to another user globally. Either you are an Android user, IOS or WEB based client u can participate in every betting event that will occur. About the language support of the platform, Betbox will use English as the main language for the betbox User interface. The User of the Platform can earn rewards in the form of OX token in the following ways\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4x9ggsu6aw21.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=90003868d706c28487f7fa7f897d152b9fe6dc97\n\n \n\n# The User Interface of Bettbox\u00a0platform\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/phthfw7z6aw21.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=a443390020130ae4187ebe5538dba5d744e6d70b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5l77tfe07aw21.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdb547a9fbcd6074b0449110fd61b58f84528897\n\n \n\n#### Problem and solution of betbox\u00a0platform\n\n* End-user cannot verify the integrity of a service provider\n* Cannot access the money flow\n* Loss of the usage of decentralized bookmakers in the smart contract\n\n**Trust and Transparency**\\- only participants are the sole decision-maker in all the process in the bet box platform using smart contracts to perform all money related action.\n\n**Service availability/downtime**\\- even the server is out of action betbox smart contract will always be running.\n\n**Scalability of the ecosystem**\\- betbox will deploy EVM sidechain (Ethereum virtual Machine) with POA consensus (Proof of Authority) and Distributed community nodes.\n\n \n\n# Ox token and Ox-Node\u00a0program\n\nOX token is the native currency of the betbox platform, it will be used as payment within the platform and can be used to participate in betting events.\n\n**Betbox platform** will also have a NODE called OX-Node program where the holders of this OX token can participate in the staking process. They say that the availability of this program is only limited so better don\u2019t be late if you target for buying OX token is to stake them. As in the Whitepaper stated that all commissions Produced by betbox platform in their OX-Sidechain will be spread proportionally to all participants of the OX-node program. So an investor that holds at least 100,000 OX token can or may apply to become a member of their consortium. For the application of the seat of the staking program, betbox will prioritize to all participants of their TGE (Token Generation Event). Being the TGE Participant of Betbox is just simply being the first Owner of OX token.\n\nOne thing that I Noticed that This OX token has no maximum supply, the question is how can we get another OX token? In the whitepaper, they concluded that in a minting consensus or they say the Proof of Activity token, there will be a new issue of this Ox token, they stated that OX token can be earned by participating in activity conduct on the platform in the way of betting. So the newly created OX token will randomly be distributed. There will be an election that the winner is based on RNG Ethereum public main net. So the chances of the participants winning a new-minted OX token depends on the particular betting contract in simplest way of explanation u cannot get a new OX Token if you don\u2019t participate in betting because it\u2019s the only way that a new ox token will be created.\n\nThe betbox platform will only create a 100,000,000 Ox token that will be divided for the following allocation program.\n\n80,000,000 for their TGE\n\n8,000,000 OX token for the bounty program and\n\n12,000,000 OX token for the company reserve\n\nOf a total of 100 million OX token that will be created see fig, below\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cnt60wk57aw21.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=9718f9cf274e1e5891a16696fcf2d1a39df2f9a6\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n#### Betbox Platform Buyback and Burn\u00a0Program\n\nAnother Program of This Platform that I like is their Buyback and burn program, but most of the ICO nowadays have such strategy to increase the value of their Product, in Betbox platform this strategy is to moderate or to prevent inflation of the OX token another thing that this program is voluntarily and not mandatory for each holder of the OX token. The idea that came in my mind that they have this strategy because there\u2019s no max supply of the OX token.\n\n>*So how can you participate in this kind of\u00a0event?*\n\nHolder will send their ox token to the previous published smart contract and these contracts have a timeframe before the buyback and burn will execute. The buyback and burn will happen 4x a year because every each quarter of a year betbox platform will conduct this event. When it comes to Transparency record, Betbox will publish it on their official channel so that there\u2019s no malicious that will happen. The profits of this will proportionally be distributed to all that who participate.\n\n#### The TGE Participants Ticket and how can you get\u00a0one\n\nThis ticket is an ERC721 token that will be given for all lucky winners of the lottery event of Betbox. This ticket is very important because, without this, you cannot participate in the Private sale event because this is one of their criteria. So now how can you win this ticket? Simple, the user\u2019s will gamble this using a Smart Contract that will provide by betbox.\n\n* User\u2019s that will participate in this lottery games provided by betbox requires 0.1 ETH\n* The Smart Contract for the lottery games will be published in Betbox Channel and can be accessed through Betbox alpha on [https://betbox.app/](https://betbox.app/)\n* The TIcket Supply Has no limit\n\n&#x200B;\n\n [https://betbox.app/](https://betbox.app/) \n\nbounty0x ID : hllelek33",

Link facilitates a smooth user experience by handling everything that traditional application users don\u2019t care about, including Ethereum wallet creation, gas calculation, and communicating directly with the Ethereum Network.Link creates a classic, conventional web API interface for any smart contract, making the benefits of blockchain programming available to developers without any blockchain experience. Even more exciting, Link enables hybrid applications that utilize the power of the Ethereum network for certain tasks, while employing alternative networks or cloud services for others, including the user interface. Additionally, Link opens an entirely new population of prospective users and clients to the growing world of decentralized applications, finally making it possible for blockchain technology to expand beyond the pool of early adopters.",

This release added a workflow for deploying a smart contract via Link.\n\nOn February 6th, we pushed through to the v1.8.1 release. Our development team adjusted password and client credential timeouts to 24 hours. We also invested in some \u201chealth\u201d items, including automated checks of database connectivity and upgrading all dependencies to their latest versions.\n\nFebruary 7th saw our v1.8.2 release pushed, which included bug fixes to API action names and a fix to a non-existent reference.\n\nFebruary 11th was one of our busiest development days yet for the Link back-end. This day saw 3 releases, moving the build version to v1.8.6. This was also mostly bug fixes, including fixing the last step of deploying a contract, which requires a database write. Dependencies were again upgraded to ensure Link is using the latest releases.\n\nOn February 12th, Solidity v0.5.4 was released by the Ethereum development team. We\u2019ve been hard at work since then to ensure compatibility with smart contracts and compiling them.\n\n [https://blockmason.link](https://blockmason.link/)",

The healthcare sector is a very important system in any society and should not be toyed with. A nation without a functional health care system is like \" a farmer without his tools \" and this calls for the needs of standard healthcare services in order to reduce sicknesses , death and diseases which will be on the increase due to poor medical services.\n\nHowever, there are lots of problems besieging the healthcare sector of many Nations and they are\n\na. inadequate health equipments\n\nb. health care cost\n\nc. lack of transparency\n\nd. lack of proper health information\n\nSince the inception of the blockchain technology, there have been some projects that were initially created to tackle the healthcare problems but they either performed little or failed.\n\nAfter several research and background checks, CUREStoken was created to tackle the issues that plague the medical field.\n\nCUREStoken is awesome innovation which will based on the Ethereum blockchain technology in other to tackle the problems of the global healthcare sector by decentralization so as to empower patients, improve the growth of healthcare App and medical health providers , thus to bring about reduction of health facilities costs, create healthy competitions and the effective maximization of the scarce health resources.\n\nCUREStoken want to diversify the health care system and came the vision of managing this change, by empowering all stakeholders through the utilization of blockchain and smart contracts.\n\nBASIC COMPONENTS OF THE CURESTOKEN\n\nThe CUREStoken Ecosystem will help the development and growth of the healthcare system through its basic pillars / components.\n\n1. Electronic Health Record : this is one of the basic functionality of the CUREStoken advanced technology. Improper documentation of patient's health care record, Insecured health care record, inacessibilty of personal records and lack of autonomous control over one's health data are some of the problems that would be by CUREStoken.\n\nThrough CUREStoken, patients will now have the right have flexible , free and unlimited access to the individual health information while offering them maximum security other data.\n\n1. Health Assurance : This will be done through a contractual agreements whether specific or future, which are done to provide the adequate health consultations without limitations.\n2. Marketplace And Trust Review System : there will be globalization of the healthcare sector which lead to the effective rise in the quality and performance of the platform through the numerous feedbacks and review that will be dropped on the platform in other promote the trust level they have for it.\n3. Trading Platform\n4. This will be a segment that is used for the sales aspect of the platform through which the medical equipment suppliers will perform the jobs without any third party. this trading platform will be inter-related with the CURES Market Place.\n5. Charitable Trust Fund\n6. This component will be funded with 5% of the token and be use dropped provide healthcare services to several users in order to improve low rated Nations in health care\n\nCURSETOKEN TOKEN ECONOMY\n\nToken Name : CURES\n\nTicker : CURES\n\nType: ERC-20 Token\n\nTotal Supply: 500 000 000 CURES\n\nMaximum Tokens For ITO: 175 000 000 CURES\n\nPrice : 1000 CRS / 1ETH\n\nSOFT CAP : 2000ETH\n\nHARD CAP : 175 000ETH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: https://www.curestoken.com/\n\nWhitepaper: https://www.curestoken.com/#whitepaper\\_cures\n\nBounty0x ID: ecamli\n\n ",

            "text": " VOLUM is the platform that satisfies these requirements and many more. It is a blockchain ecosystem for manufacturers, bottlers, distillers, distributors, governing agencies, brand incubators and creators of Alcoholic beverages. On VOLUM, manufacturers, bottlers, distillers and distributors can exchange, view, upload, download, notarize, register, validate, approve and disapprove data regarding contracts, purchases, register of raw goods, tracking and tracing of products and materials, identification of products, trade assurance of products, letter of intentions, Certificate of Origin, purchase orders, paperwork regarding specific processes in different parts of the business, delivery, liquids registration and of course payment. In addition to this functionality, VOLUM also provides the following useful services: \n\n **Government Authorities** will have a fixed and permanent presence on the platform, from where they will be able to streamline their processes that they are required to carry out such as licensing, process tracking, Colas, Certificate of Origins, Registration of Brands, Permits tracking and verification of licenses and vetted status. \n\n **Customs and Border** patrol will have a presence so as to have regulatory access to importation and exportation documents, certificate of origin and their respective processes.\n\n **Internal Service Revenue** too, will have a platform presence in order to verify companies income production, and be able to receive instant payments for their respected tax schedules depending on the rate per transaction. \n\n **The platform** also works with various regulatory agencies to provide legal advice and process information. Working primarily as a B2B platform in a manner similar to popular wholesale-to-retail online markets, VOLUM has a native cryptocurrency on the platform called VOL, which is used for purchasing memberships for business accounts and regular membership. On VOLUM, vendor accounts require different types of bonds in line with different permitted levels of transactions and business interactions. The platform has a feature for keeping transactions \u201cinsured\u201d by collecting a percentage of transactions and directing them to a pool that indemnifies purchases and transactions, as well as merchandise if the client decides to pay a fee for the insurance of their transaction. This insurance covers bottle breakage, lost or damage goods or services, malpractice, an many more common industry mishaps. The construction of VOLUM on a blockchain framework is for reasons of transparency and ledger technology that provide every company or client with the ability to do business securely and track and trace the data involved using smart contracts and blockchain validation. The VOLUM platform already has a number of proof-of-concept subjects confirmed for a trial including an international distillery, a bottle manufacturer, a liquor distribution company, a healthcare company, a construction company, an import and export company and two liquor brands. \n\n **Platform Architecture Outlines** Volum is an innovative B2B blockchain platform for alcoholic beverage manufacturers, bottlers, distillers, distributors, governing agencies and brand incubators. VOLUM provides these companies the ability to exchange, view, notarize, register, validate and approve data regarding contracts, purchases, tracking and tracing of products and materials, identification of products, letters of intention, certificates of origin, purchase orders, deliveries and of course payments, VOLUM will execute an TGE campaign in an initial step toward the future platform launch.  \n\n **STAGE 1. TOKEN GENERATION EVENT** For the Token Generation Event (TGE) stage we will deploy ERC20 tokens on Ethereum Mainnet. We chose this platform because it has clear advantages over competitors:\n\n **Market acceptance** \\- the most popular platform for TGEs. \n\n**Easy to invest** \\- majority of crypto wallets use Ethereum.\n\n **ERC20** \\- most popular token standard - easily accepted by crypto exchanges. \n\nEvery user who becomes an initial token holder will go through KYC/AML and after successful completion will be able to contribute to VOLUM.  \n\n At the moment when VOLUM receives contributions, a smart contract automatically deploys ERC20 tokens to the user\u2019s wallet based on the exchange rate.\n\n The overall process will look as presented below: \n\nFigure 2. Stage 1 - Token sale architecture description \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Stage 1 - Token sale architecture description ](https://preview.redd.it/cpb54x6etjq21.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=267fcdf9c3d6ccf8b24e83ae59a28540a496c721)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Process flow overview:**\n\n \u2022 Investor enters to the VOLUM TGE Cabinet. \n\n\u2022 He goes through KYC/AML.\n\n \u2022 After verification, he is able to contribute to the VOLUM by using both fiat and crypto.\n\n **Crypto:** \n\n\u2022 If user chooses crypto, he pings his wallet to send coins to the VOLUM. \n\n\u2022 Fiat: \n\n\u2022 If user chooses fiat, he pings his bank account to send fiat (bank wire or/and bank card) to the VOLUM Bank account.\n\n \u2022 VOLUM Bank Account pings VOLUM Smart contract regarding funds receiving. \n\n\u2022 VOLUM Tokensale Smart Contract mints VOLUM tokens in the amount which is equal to the amount of investors contribution based on exchange rate. \n\n\u2022 After that, investors are able to use VOLUM tokens for trading, p2p transactions and as an access to the VOLUM platform. \n\n **STAGE 2. HYBRID SYSTEM INTRODUCTION** \n\n After the token sale event, VOLUM Coins can be used to access the VOLUM platform that has been developed for a smooth transition. After the consortium chain grows to sufficient amount (1,000 tps for a network of 10,000-20,000 active users), it will be derived from computational power provided by users and is hard to predict in the near future as start nodes will be backed with Cloud VMs. VOLUM Oracle node will start to exchange VOLUM tokens from Mainnet to VOLUM tokens inside the consortium chain. VOLUM will avoid speed limitations of Ethereum and decline the Gas price as it will be calculated differently (time of SC exceeding average transaction execution in seconds multiplied by the average transaction fees/average transaction per second). Building the system on top of Ethereum Mainnet will entail operational costs and time-lags as transaction speed is limited by 20-25 transactions per second is a huge problem for users. That is why a hybrid system establishing the VOLUM platform on Ethereum Mainnet (public chain) with computation power on the sidechain of Ethereum codenamed, Ethereum Consortium Chain is an optimal solution. When a user concludes an agreement/deal (smart contract), they receive an appropriate ERC721 token, which is minted by a smart contract that stores all information needed as proof for the VOLUM platform. Data will also be stored in VOLUM\u2019s external data storage infrastructure and the hash-data will be stored on blockchain, namely in a VOLUM smart contract using SHA-256 for data encryption. It turns certain fixed-length values into a random dataset that serve as an identifier for the data to validate and sign digital security certificates and documents. The obtained value, like duplicate source data, cannot be extracted. It means it will be impossible to read, change or delete data from the blockchain. Each ERC721 token also stores all geo-waypoint data in it. So both Consumer and Customer have equal access to all the information regarding a deal. Also, in VOLUM we have developed the opportunity for users to insure their deals automatically just by putting an appropriate checkmark in the smart contract. This insurance feature was realized by development an appropriate smart contract (see description here -> link). The cost will be included in the transaction.  \n\n The overall process will look as presented below: \n\nFigure 3. Stage 2 - Hybrid system operational workflow \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Hybrid system operational workflow ](https://preview.redd.it/49j5pcgytjq21.png?width=851&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2119049e725e3f2288ecf7df365b1a9693f4935)\n\n For efficient tracking, consortium chain will have an unlimited supply of internal tokens that can be conveniently arranged with Docker in containers (by types of agreements). At this stage, SC in Ethereum Mainnet will include only input addresses of VOLUM tokens and output addresses according to the agreement on Gas fees. Between input and output addresses there will be oraclization. \n\n**The Webpage**\n\n [https://volum.io/](https://volum.io/) \n\n**The WP**\n\n [https://volum.io/assets/images/volum-whitepaper.pdf](https://volum.io/assets/images/volum-whitepaper.pdf) \n\n**Bounty0x ID**: hllelek33",

The following is a list of every method I'm aware of for earning free cryptocurrencies. I avoided shady websites, apps I hadn't tried before, and services that forced you to download rogue games and malware. There are no referral codes on this list because it only contains trusted services.\n\nIf you think I missed something, please let me know in the comments so that others can take a look.\n\n[MOON, DOGE, NANO] on Reddit:\nReddit, for example. There are a few ways to make money with cryptocurrency on Reddit. Then there's MOONs, our personal favourite. You only need to set up your vault (on the app) to start receiving moons in the next distribution! They happen once a month, and a certain number of moons are distributed to the r/CryptoCurrency community based on your Karma for the previous month. So go ahead and start shitposting! Other subreddits, such as Dogecoin's and Nano's, have bots that allow you to tip users, so if you make a good submission there, you'll almost certainly get some coins from generous redditors. There are also subreddits like r/dogecoinbeg where you can... So, if you want dogecoins, beg for them.\n\nGames and Collectibles [various cryptocurrencies]: Many games use NFTs to create unique and rare in-game assets, and many of them run on a blockchain. Consider a card game like HeartStone: on the blockchain, only 10 cards of a specific type can be created (using NFTs), meaning only 10 people in the world can own that card, making it extremely rare and valuable.\nIt's not easy to earn crypto this way; you'll need to play for a while before you can sell anything, but if you find a game that you enjoy, you'll be able to earn while having fun!\n\nBrave browser: allows you to earn BAT simply by browsing the web and viewing advertisements. Both on a computer and on a mobile device.\n\nSimilarly, there's an app called social good that rewards users with cryptocurrency when they buy something online.\n\n\nThough I'm just getting started with farming and staking, I'd love to hear your thoughts on these??",

For the uninitiated, Web3 refers to the Internet's third generation, which is based on blockchain technology.\n\n It incorporates decentralisation concepts and is powered by cryptocurrency. Web3 is an attempt to empower end-users and decentralise control, as opposed to the previous iteration of the internet, known as Web2 or Web2.0, where data and content was in the hands of a few companies, commonly referred to as 'Big Tech.'\n\nWeb3 will shape the gaming industry's future. We believe Web3 is the next step in the evolution of gaming, just as mobile and free-to-play were.\n\n In-app purchases in battle royale games like BGMI are familiar to today's gamers, but they have no value outside of the game. This is where crypto gaming comes in handy. It enables users to increase the value of their purchases. In crypto games, store tokens, such as in-game products, are frequently stored on a distributed ledger atop a crypto network. The blockchain is the distributed ledger that allows game products to be traded for cryptocurrency, which can then be converted to real money.\n\nConsider what would happen if players could resell that horse armour or profit from the schematics by selling them to other players. There is a way to do this with Web3 + crypto + blockchain in a frictionless, decentralised manner without relying on a single platform. \n\nIn-app purchases allow players to purchase items directly from the game, such as coins, extra lives, custom characters, outfits, and accessories. When it comes to crypto gaming, in-app purchases are made when players purchase items with cryptocurrency or purchase cryptocurrency itself. Traditional games, on the other hand, typically purchase assets from a central developer-owned store, which benefits the developers rather than the players.\n\nFurthermore, in traditional games, players have no control over the game's life cycle.\n\nYou play a game, usually with an NFT character you purchase, and earn tokens for your victories and achievements, which you can then exchange for cash. Axis infinity is a good example of this type of game. The community of cryptocurrency gamers is growing, and I believe this will result in significant gains. \n\nThere are projects in place to combat the crypto gaming phenomenon, where people can buy and trade crypto gaming NFts and tokens all in one place. \n\nThe Xchange monster is one such monster in this seector to look out and it can help gamers and promoters In great way.\n\nAs more people turn to p2e and gaming has evolved into a career, I believe the gaming industry will boom in the near future.

A slew of projects have sprung up to aid in real-world problem-solving efforts, including brave browser, which you may have heard of because of its creator. The workings of brave browser are as follows.\n\nBrave browser is similar to Google Chrome, but it is spyware-free and pays in BAT. Although BAT earnings have decreased as Brave's popularity has grown. Even if you only have a small BAT balance, Brave is a good option to use because of its excellent ad blocker. However, the ethos that underpins the brave browser concept is worth noting. Because it is true that firstly, you are paid for your attention and secondly, advertisements steal time from your life - and time is the most valuable resource we have.\n\nYou're still doing something that resembles watching commercials. What if I told you that you could make money by connecting your internet to a specific crypto project? Pkt money is on its way. On the market, this is a brand-new project. It's a web-based software. PKT is a free and open source mesh networking project that uses the cjdns protocol. PKT and cjdns were both created by PKT's lead developer, Caleb James DeLisle.\n\nYou can make money with your bandwidth by using it for your daily needs rather than mining it with hardware. Here's a free way to measure the amount of Internet bandwidth used by mining rigs. Every time we do something with cryptocurrency mining, we try to strike a balance. What we're doing has to be both effective and cost-effective. Almost every non-essential cost that we include in the mining equation reduces profits. On top of those two criteria, a distant third is simple. We've fortunately conquered all three for this exercise.\n\nWe'll assume you don't have a specialised router that can perform granular measurements. If you did, you probably wouldn't be reading this article. \n\nSo we've established that we want to go with a low-cost option. There is no room (or need) for a high-priced piece of hardware. \n\nWe can do everything we need to do for free with software. You can use your bandwidth to earn cryptos without having to mine for them with pkt cash now that you know the basics.\n\nPacketCrypt, the world's first bandwidth-hard proof of work, is used by PKT. When you connect your home or office internet to the PKT Network, you can earn PKT Cash (PKT).",

Now, depending on the price and the medium you're using, this can be risky at times. \nA slew of projects have emerged to aid in real-world problem-solving efforts, such as brave browser, which you may have heard of due to its creator. The following is how brave browser works.\n\nBrave browser is similar to Google Chrome but without the spyware, and it also pays you in BAT. Although, since Brave's popularity has grown, BAT earnings have decreased.\n\n Brave is a good option to use even if you only have a small BAT balance because its ad blocker is fantastic. But pay attention to the ethos that underpins the brave browser concept.\n\n Because the ideas that 1) you get paid for your attention and 2) ads steal time from your life - and time is the most valuable resource we have - are true.\n\nYou can now earn cryptocurrency simply by going about your daily routine. However, in terms of other crypt, this is only one layer. Let's go back one more layer, and consider this layer to be your internet connectivity. What if I told you that you could make money with this?\n\nIt sounds cool.\n\nThere's a project called pkt cash, for example. The PKT Network is entirely run by the people who use it. There is no pre-mine, no central company, and no investors. PKT technology lowers the entry barriers to the internet service world.\n\nPKT uses PacketCrypt, the world\u2019s first bandwidth-hard proof of work. You can earn PKT Cash (PKT) when you connect your home or office internet to the PKT Network.",

The more I looked into the [technical side](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1BiOcClgDVNESaPA3L7bYw?si=2f42603c53854d12), the less value I perceived. Time and time again I observed people were willing to turn a blind eye to obvious issues in order to generate a sense of hype.\n\nEveryone was willing to believe someone else had figured it out but the closer I came to the emperor's chamber the more I realized that he was [wearing no clothes](https://www.bookbrowse.com/expressions/detail/index.cfm/expression_number/605/the-emperor-has-no-clothes).\n\nA little compromise here, a little blindness there and the great deception is formed.\n\nWhere are the people of integrity?\n\nIf you don't know what I'm talking about I suggest reading:\n\n[The idea that NFTs will allow you to take items between worlds is a pipe dream driven by ignorance. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaverse/comments/tz6520/the_idea_that_nfts_will_allow_you_to_take_items/)\n\nNot only that I have noticed that artificial intelligence is being used here on Reddit to write articles in mass to promote the value of NFTs and crypto. It's the same article over and over and over again with synonyms changed. Then these posts are upvoted by bots creating a fake-news cycle supposedly supported by the masses.\n\nHowever, the [more research I do](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaversestartup/comments/tjc6fk/as_a_gamer_i_would_be_less_inclined_to_play_games/) the less human support I see for this hype cycle.\n\nAre we all just being led along by bots?\n\n# Finally, my question:\n\nI really believe in being objective about things and not just taking a position and being unwilling to change your mind. So I have been talking with industry experts trying to probe and find a way to challenge my own idea of the metaverse.There's one thing that I've been unable to refute concerning a possible value for NFTs, and I came here to see what people think:\n\nIn the past it's been very difficult to track the royalties of art sales. Let's say I create a piece of fine art and I want to give it up in exchange for royalties on its sale to a publisher. I want a transparent way to track this art throughout the web and get my royalties.\n\n# Is there any real, serious, legitimate use case for NFTs?",

In addition, several participating platforms will incorporate a quick TaxBit registration within their applications to simplify access to tax information tools.\n\n\"If a user has taxable transactions on platforms that are not part of the TaxBit Network, there will be a cost to retrieve the tax forms from off-network platforms, \" TaxBit noted.\n\nThe new development aims to remove barriers to adoption of [cryptocurrencies development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) in general, ensuring that cryptocurrency users in the US can comply with taxes without spending tons of money. \"Historically, the process of generating cryptocurrency tax forms cost individuals hundreds to thousands of dollars per year, depending on whether they were using DIY software or hiring an accountant,\" TaxBit said.\n\nBinance.US CEO Brian Shroder noted that the company's participation in the TaxBit network is a crucial step in its commitment to security and compliance, especially after President Joe Biden signed the infrastructure law in November.\n\nTaxBit is a leading cryptocurrency-focused tax compliance firm that brings together tax attorneys and software developers to build software that simplifies and automates the cryptocurrency tax filing process.  Backed by the Winklevoss twins' family office, TaxBit has seen remarkable growth recently,  securing an increase from $ 130 million to a valuation of $ 1.3 billion in August 2021.",

They can be found in arcades and on Atari consoles at home. The internet was the name of the next metaverse, which was the internet itself. Because it is still going strong, you may have heard of it. The two worlds collided over two decades ago, resulting in Second Life, Minecraft, and, most recently, Fortnite. This is a universe within a universe within a universe within a universe within a universe within a universe within a universe within a universe within a universe within a universe within a universe within a universe It's a world of social media out there.\n\nSupporters of the metaverse envision users working, playing, and staying in touch with friends through a variety of venues, including concerts and conferences as well as virtual trips around the world. Microsoft is interested in developing the metaverse, as are gaming platforms like Roblox and Minecraft. They're all betting big on the \"future,\" and only time will tell who will come out on top.\n\nBecause the metaverse is not controlled by a single company and there is no such thing as first mover advantage, investing in it should appeal to everyone.\n\nThe market is becoming more sophisticated as every corporation tries their hand in the metaverse, but some may disagree. People will have no trouble deciding which metaverse to visit because they will be divided into groups according to their requirements.\n\nSeveral companies have begun to dabble in this high-tech field, including Next Earth, a platform that digitises the earth's surface using blockchain technology. The platform can be used to claim ownership of any location on the planet, which you can then monetize or develop as NFTs. Metaverse sounds futuristic, and many companies, including Facebook, are working to make it a reality. Cryptocurrencies could play a significant role in this.\n\nStarting its own metaverse does not guarantee Facebook a majority stake in the metaverse world; there are other competitors to be aware of. Fb(meta) will, in my opinion, do nothing but random things and will be a virtual reality-enhanced version of the Facebook app. Or something like Quint: Amazon of the Metaverse, which I think is great for NFTs and has a chapter-by-chapter storyline with what I believe is the main plot line.

Several vendors have already launched telco-grade blockchain solutions, with many use cases aimed at improving internal communications service provider operations and processes (CSPs)\n\nDespite the fact that vendor blockchain solutions aimed at serving the needs of the telecoms industry are still in their infancy, IBM, Oracle, Huawei, and even Elite from Italy are among the first to integrate blockchain.

In the next five years, I believe you'll need a CONTENT CREATION TEAM that takes your vision, conducts research, compiles data, envisions the many different forms of communication (many of which are listed above), and starts creating ALL of them to see which ones reach their ideal customers.\n\nMany major players, including Elite with its elimobile and Giant Protocol, a new startup, have entered the market. While Elite has a large user base, Giant is a newcomer that is using a novel approach to essentially tokenize spare bandwidth, turning cellular access into a digital asset and phone numbers into wallets that can be used to pay for network access anywhere. And, while they'll streamline the process and narrow the types of content they create (at first), they'll continue to use a variety of media to bring in new clients/customers. Most entrepreneurs don't have time to create content, so they hire VAs (virtual assistants) like me to do it for them.\n\nThey can form a m to create the other forms for selected articles once that content (mostly written) is created, until they determine that they need ALL (or as many as possible) of the forms of media to expand their audience/customer base. We'll have to see how successful they are in this endeavour. As a result, content creation appears to have a promising future in the next five years. There is a lot of growth and competition in this field. The demand for talented and skilled content creators is at an all-time high, and it will continue to rise in the coming years, thanks to the growing demand for new and unique content.",

Last Wednesday, during an interview with CNBC's Squawk Box show, Jay shared his thoughts on cryptocurrencies and how it should be regulated in the future.\n\n**The former SEC chairman said that he is a \"great believer in cryptocurrency technology\" and that its efficiency advantages in the financial system and tokenization are enormous.**\n\n\"I'm a big believer in this technology,\" says Jay Clayton of cryptocurrencies. \"The efficiency benefits in the financial system and in other aspects of tokenization are immense.\"\n\nClayton's comments come as current SEC Chairman Gary Gensler recently confirmed that the watchdog has no plans to ban cryptocurrencies , but that the US Congress could. However, Gensler cautioned that cryptocurrencies in their current form are comparable to the Wild West without proper regulation.\n\n**When asked if the current president is creating too many restrictions on the cryptocurrency industry, Jay said that cryptocurrencies serve numerous purposes and are connected to a variety of industries, and the SEC should be in charge of regulating only those sectors that are linked to it.**\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies are a wide variety of products, with a wide variety of functions, and the rules of our financial system are clear and durable. If you are raising capital for a project, you must register your capital raising with the SEC. If you are trading securities, you must be in a registered place, but there are many sectors of cryptocurrencies, such as stablecoins, that are not securities and are outside the purview of the SEC. \"\n\nAccording to Clayton, [development of cryptocurrencies](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) must be implemented but with proper regulation. He said the government must be \"reactive with people who are violating our well-defined laws, but proactive in encouraging the adoption of this technology throughout our financial system.\"\n\n**Clayton did not allow the approval of a Bitcoin ETF during his tenure, which occurred now in 2021 under Gary Gensler** . Since then, the agency has come under fire for rejecting spot ETF applications and approving Bitcoin futures ETFs. Grayscale sent a letter to SEC Secretary Vanessa Countryman stating that \"there is no basis for the position that investing in derivatives for an asset is acceptable to investors, but not investing in the asset itself.\" The SEC was accused of treating the two Bitcoin ETF proposals unevenly under the Administrative Protection Act, or APA.",

Netherlands-based decentralized carbon offset exchange Coorest and Southern Hemisphere conservation consultancy PLCnetwork have teamed up to tokenize individual endangered animals in privately owned game reserves and conservation areas in Africa. These wild animal NFTs allow owners to sponsor an elephant, lion, cheetah or rhino. Proceeds from sales will go towards the food, shelter and safety of the animals they represent.\n\nCointelegraph spoke with William ten Zijthoff, founder and CEO of Coorest, to learn more about combining blockchain and sustainability with wildlife preservation. Coorest is best known for operating a CO2 offset system, NFTrees, that tokenizes assets or performance bonds and carbon credits that are tradable on the blockchain. Those who buy an NFTree collect and burn the CO2 tokens to record the amount of CO2 reduced.\n\nSimilarly, the concept of wildlife treats conservation as an asset that should be invested in for the good of both the animals and the environment. He explained that conservation areas or ecological lodges \"need new business models that don't depend on tourism for income or donations.\" That's why Coorest partnered with the Southern Hemisphere PLCnetwork, with connections to wildlife reserves in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana.\n\nAccording to Dr. Julia Baum, founder of PLCnetwork, the main problem with on-the-ground wildlife conservation is that \"it's expensive and resources are often very limited.\" Even for a private reserve with a generally larger budget, the cost of caring for an African savannah elephant, for example, can be very expensive because it includes fencing, guarding, 24-hour anti-poaching patrols and veterinary support.\n\nAsked what the main benefits of owning an elephaNFT or lioNFT are, Zijthoff said it's about establishing a long-term relationship with the animals, the wildlife reserve and Coorest. He also clarified that owning a wildlife NFT does not grant ownership of the animals, but instead provides a monthly \"proof of life\" verification that the animal is still alive. The metadata of each [NFT development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) contains species, age, and sex information specific to each tokenized animal.\n\nHolders will also be invited to visit the wildlife reserve and meet the animals. 70% of the funds from these wildlife NFTs will go to the game reserve or conservation area, with funds released on a monthly calendar. or established. VulcanForged is a blockchain gaming studio and NFT marketplace that has partnered with Coorest to sell and feature their wildlife NFTs in various play-to-earn games, offering holders additional in-game uses and rewards. \n\nAs this first wildlife NFT pilot project is underway to \"further develop mainstream conservation innovation,\" Baum believes this new type of impact [NFT development ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development)can raise awareness of wildlife action to a new and broader audience. conservation and social development. The long-term goal is further investment and success on the ground around the world, she added.",

From a regulatory perspective, you're never going to have a single 'metaverse law' that tries to cover everything, in the same way, there is no one-stop single 'internet law', because that just doesn't make any sense,\u201d said Harding.\n\nThe Metaverse has left behind it many legal gaps that still need to be filled, and before that happens, I don\u2019t think any rolling out officially will be going on.",

The Ronin Network has said it\u2019s in the process of conducting a thorough investigation, working with blockchain researcher Chainalysis to monitor the stolen funds and CrowdStrike to handle forensics.\n\nPlatforms need to outfit themselves with better security features like how OpenSea marketplace and Exeno Marketplace are doing. \nMore needs to be done because it is tiring that people have to lose their funds.",

            "text": "The Solana Foundation reported that the Solana blockchain had met its year-end carbon neutrality goal. The milestone was achieved, according to the Foundation, by supporting refrigerant degradation to offset Solana's carbon footprint in 2021.\n\nThe press release stated that CFC and HFC refrigerants - climate gases 10,000 times more potent than CO2 \u2014 will be permanently destroyed thanks to the Solana Foundation. The project produces jobs while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions immediately.\n\nCarbon-neutrality has previously been linked to Ripple's XRP Ledger [XRPL]. Ripple has previously declared the XRP Ledger to be \"one of the first major carbon neutral blockchains.\" \n\nFurthermore, Ripple collaborated on the development of a CBDC with the central banks of Bhutan and Palau. When it came to working with Palau, the American blockchain company's carbon-neutral XRPL was a big selling factor, according to the company. \n\nWhen it came to the amount of energy utilized per transaction, Solana claimed to have used 0.00053kWh. A single XRP transaction, on the other hand, consumes around 0.0079 kWh. This represents a big change in energy usage.\n\nSolana as a crypto created in 2019, has seen large improvement and increases in value. Solana is also used for several projects part of which is for digital arts, that is, NFT as it has Kambrian based upon it. Kambrian is an NFT marketplaces that accept $darc as a means of payment. \n\nIf Solana keeps up the carbon neutral initiative, it will be interesting to note whether larger investors or even central banks will decide to call upon the fifth biggest crypto\u2019s leaders to help develop sustainable CBDCs.",

I think that in the future, the NFTs will win the race from the crypto coins, and will become the most traded items on the internet.\n\nThat means a change is going to take place, and projects that have NFTs in their ecosystems will become more popular. MetaHero, Binamon en Women Empowerment Token are examples of projects that recently caught my attention. But there are many, many more of them. But on the other hand, we have project White Whale Terra, who don't use NFTs in their ecosystem. \n\nSo what do you think about the rise of the NFTs?

The way gaming overcomes the remaining roadblocks will serve as a model for other industries considering widespread blockchain adoption.\n\nWhen it became clear that cryptocurrency wasn't the only application for blockchain, it was hailed as a game-changer. Now, its game-changing applications appear to be more hype than reality, and many people believe it is overhyped. Blockchain, according to Bill Gates, is a \"technological tour de force.\" It's \"the biggest opportunity set we can think of over the next decade,\" according to NASDAQ CEO Bob Greifeld. The effects of blockchain, if the Gates and Greifelds of the world are correct, will be foundational, immediate, and overwhelmingly positive.\n\nBlockchain gaming, like other applications, has a number of potential drawbacks. The impetus for implementation, according to Sterling, could simply be \"regulatory arbitrage\"\u2014there are tax and legal ramifications for selling in-game currency outside of the game. He asks, \"Why doesn't Blizzard sell gold?\" referring to the company behind World of Warcraft and Starcraft.\n\nIn addition, players in traditional games have no control over the game's life cycle. You play a game, usually with a purchased NFT character, and earn tokens for your victories and achievements, which you can then exchange for cash. A good example of this type of game is Axis infinity. The cryptocurrency gaming community is expanding, and as a result, I anticipate significant gains. To combat the crypto gaming phenomenon, there are projects in place where people can buy and trade crypto gaming NFts and tokens all in one place. The Xchange monster project is one such project to keep an eye on in this sector, as it has the potential to greatly assist gamers and promoters.\n\nNFTs have become a novel way for gamers to profit from their one-of-a-kind collectibles. It will be interesting to see how things turn out in 2022, as it is expected to be a watershed year for GameFi.",

Things calmed down for a while after this period of explosive growth, but the company forgot to re-tighten its safety procedures.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t8r8534n2wq81.jpg?width=1155&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=351fcf95f33ad1d04e1240aee3724f1871e2d05c\n\n## Bridges\n\nBridges are software that can be used to convert tokens into ones that can be used on another network. Bridges have often been the source of problems and this hack adds strong evidence to support this narrative. The code supporting many bridges has not been audited, and often the identities of validators are not clear.\u00a0\n\n## 9 Validator Nodes...Decentralised in Name Only\n\nThe main problem here was that the network was not decentralised enough. Ronin is developed by a game studio called Sky Mavis. Sky Mavis' ronin chain uses only 9 validator nodes, and the hacker was able to hack into 5 of them by gaining access to the private keys of these 5 validator nodes. As soon as the hackers gained access to 5 nodes, they had access to over 50% of the network and could validate any transactions they wanted to. They forged fake withdrawals and stole ETH and USDC. The more decentralised a network is, the harder it is to take control of more than 50% of the validator nodes, and the safer the network is\n\n## The Hack took six days to discover\n\nThe hack actually occurred on March 23rd, but the missing funds went by unnoticed until March 29th, when a customer was unable to withdraw their funds.\u00a0\n\n## The one who discovered it before everyone else\n\nThe first person to discover this hack went and told ... no one. Their chosen course of action was to quietly short Ronin (bet on the price to go down). But unfortunately for them, it took everyone else SIX DAYS to discover the hack. Because it took so long, they were liquidated out of their position and did not make any money. Why didn't this person alert people to the hack once they had shorted Ronin? Because that would have been even dodgier than what they were doing already.\u00a0\n\n**Or there's another theory**\n\nThat this was the hacker trying to double-dip. Some say the hacker hacked the network and then shorted Ronin themselves. That would explain why they didn't alert anyone about the hack themselves, after they had taken on the short position.\u00a0\n\n## Where are the funds now?\n\nThis is the beauty of the blockchain. Most of the funds are still in the hacker's wallet. You can see it [here](https://flight.beehiiv.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)!\n\nAnother ironic thing about this whole situation is that these folks were smart enough to pull off a heist worth $600 million + and then stored their winnings on... centralised exchanges. So now they are going to face a tough time getting those stolen funds out.\u00a0 Not only this, but these exchanges often have Know your Customer (KYC) verification checks, which could be used to uncover the identity of these hackers.\u00a0\n\nA more common (maybe smarter?) strategy for hackers is to use exchanges that don't have any KYC in place and not try to cash out too much too quickly, as this would raise suspicion.\u00a0\n\nIn any case, getting these funds out will be a very difficult job. There was a case last year where a hacker hacked the Poly network for $611 million, but eventually [returned the funds](https://flight.beehiiv.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) when they realised there was no way of getting them out.\u00a0\n\n## Where does this leave us?\n\nThis is the largest crypto hack in history. There were certainly shortcomings when it came to the security systems in place, but that's not going to stop people from questioning the safety of blockchain networks in general. The world will be watching closely to see if these hackers can get their ill-gotten gains out of the system. If they can, this may encourage generations of future hackers. Will they be able to do it? We can only sit back and watch how this plays out...  \n\n\nIf you enjoyed this, maybe I can tempt you with the [Newbies Crypto newsletter](https://www.newbiescrypto.com/).

The documentary is based on the mysterious death of the now-defunct crypto exchange QuadrigaCX founder. The reviews of the film turned out to be quite controversial. After all, DYOR is a motto in crypto, so we suggest watching the film to make your own opinion, as the event itself is a big deal for mass adoption of crypto.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 TIME has presented a list of the top 100 most influential companies and has included four companies related to crypto.

If you build your game on the blockchain and allow players to buy and sell in-game assets with digital currencies, they'll have a secure way to do so. Several projects are currently working on blockchain gaming. You'll undoubtedly require some kind of assistance in order to run these games smoothly on a large scale, and a gamer will not only play one game but many, necessitating the holding of numerous assets. Special gaming exchanges, where you can trade in-game assets and NFTs, could solve this problem.

You might want to gamble anonymously or hide your trades from your bank (or the government). \n\nUntil cryptocurrency becomes more widely accepted, crypto gaming will most likely remain a niche hobby.\n\nIf you want to invest in crypto games, you must first learn about them. People are starting to profit from encrypted games, which have taken over the gaming industry.\n\n Playing a variety of crypto games can earn you money. Choose the first game you'd like to play. After that, and only then, should you think about investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\nYou play a game, usually with an NFT character you buy, and earn tokens for your wins and achievements, which you can then trade for cash.\n\n A good example of this type of game is Axis infinity. The cryptocurrency gaming community is expanding, and I believe this will lead to significant gains. To combat the crypto gaming phenomenon, there are projects in place where people can buy and trade crypto gaming NFts and tokens all in one place. One such monster is the Xchange monster.\n\nAccording to industry insiders, this trend will likely explode in 2022. NFTs, according to EA's CEO, are \"an important part of our industry's future.\" The CEO of Ubisoft called them a \"revolution\" in online gaming. In 2021, gaming-related NFTs generated $4.8 billion in revenue. The hype, on the other hand, is dividing the gaming community.",

It is nice that these exchanges are thinking about the decentralization of crypto users. \n I wonder what the highly performing traders on Tycoon.io think about this.   \n\nNoting that Coinbase believes \u201ceveryone deserves access to basic financial services unless the law says otherwise,\u201d Armstrong said Friday.",

Several crypto exchanges are keen to get involved and tons of NFT marketplaces have been established.\n\n Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, expects the NFT market to surpass the size of Coinbase\u2019s cryptocurrency business, which recently reported third-quarter revenue of about $1.3bn. Alarming right? Such has been the allure of NFTs.\n\nBut even with NFTs gaining popularity, as with any other asset class, there is always the risk that the bubble bursts.\n\n NFTs may be the belle of the ball right now, but, as with any new technology, there is still some way to go before mainstream acceptance.\n\nDespite the mouth-watering sums changing hands in headline-grabbing NFT transactions, they are still very much a niche product, and may well turn out to be a passing fancy like digital tulips, or Cryptokitties, even. \n\nHolders of tokens could end up sitting on a surplus amount of NFTs with little buying interest if there is a slump in their popularity, in the same way as numerous bubbles have burst over the last several years.\n\n However, as with the wider use of the blockchain, it does seem clear that because of NFTs\u2019 usefulness as records of ownership in business, they could well be here to stay in one form or another. \n\nEnthusiasts have even referred to NFTs as the future of physical art and NFT marketplaces as the future of art galleries. Either way, the jury is still out on the longevity of NFTs.\n\n For now, I will continue my NFT minting, buying and selling on the Suku World marketplace.",

Back then, charlatans would round up a worthless commodity and make a killing in profit by selling it off before the unsuspecting public gets wind of the scheme. Since the dawn of ICOs, the blockchain industry has been plagued by \u201cPump and dump\u201d schemes. For ICOs It is essentially the same methodology. In an ICO pump and dump scheme, a small group of individuals accumulate stockpiles of a new cryptocurrency with bogus value prospects, then artificially inflate the coin\u2019s price through misinformation, this leads to a spike in the exchange rate of the said coin. The next step in the scheme is selling out the coin completely at or before the peak of the coin\u2019s market value, invariably leaving unsuspecting buyers with nothing. Sadly, pump and dump schemes are very rampant today and are not always easy to detect.\n\nHowever, there is some good news. ICO market data carry some signs of a potential pump and dump scheme which can be detected in the early stages with the right tools and algorithms. This is a branch of data science and DevOps that has the potential to completely eradicate pump and dump schemes. I recently heard that the RiseUp V2 application is one of such tools we can leverage on the aforementioned indicators to detect pump and dump schemes. I will be sure to try them and let you know. Nonetheless, this is great news for the crypto community.",

The down-trend market makes some altcoins goes under its real value. And there's a chance for us to grab some good coins at the great price for holding purpose.\n\nHave a look at Bluzelle Coin Total Supply, only 500.000.000 and Circulating Supply is 191.211.760 tokens. With that quantity, even if BLZ reaches $0,3 per token(mean 200% profit), the marketcap of Bluzelle Coin will be only around $ 60m. That's pretty low with a great company like Bluzelle - which was called the \"Oracle\" of Blockchain field and \"Global Fintech 100\" by H2 Venture. Don't forget that BLZ market cap reached $134m in May 2018, and 2018 is a bad year of cryptocurrency. So I believe when the market recovery, BLZ will get a spot in the Top 50.\n\nIf you need to know more about #Bluzelle, visit their website:  [https://bluzelle.com](https://bluzelle.com) ",

            "text": "# ETHA   Background \n\n Today\u2019s business environment provides a fertile ground for new ideas, services and tools, which are being developed in a fast-paced world to sustainably improve our everyday lives. Our story began in early 2014. After experiencing difficulties to effectively use digital currencies as a means to send money abroad, we quickly realized there were no existing solutions to send money using cryptocurrencies to a novice who does not want to use cryptocurrencies. The ETHA project was born as a solution to address the high transaction fees and lack of possibilities digital currency holders have to actually send fiat globally using their digital assets. After extensively researching the remittance and financial industry, and finding out that there are approximately 2.5 billion (2017) people globally without access to financial services, we came to the conclusion that it was time for a solution since our background lies in international business and finance.\n\n#  1.1 Our Mission & Vision \n\n ETHA\u2019s mission is to leverage the blockchain technology with our emerging ecosystem to make remittance services accessible and to add value for more consumers\u2019 auspicious use of digital assets. We envision a world where the ETHA ecosystem and the distributed ledger network is providing affordable financial products and services that meet individuals\u2019 needs delivered in a responsible and sustainable way to reduce poverty and boost prosperity. \n\n#  1.2 Measuring Financial Inclusion \n\n Changes and innovations in technology, especially the use of smartphones, have been driving financial access and inclusion. Smartphones and other devices with internet access have brought financial services to the individuals instead of requiring an individual to travel long distances to traditional financial institutions. However, there is still a significant gap in financial inclusion worldwide. ETHA is focusing on extending financial access to people who are difficult to reach and to those living in rural areas. The implementation of the ETHA ecosystem unifies the internal and external operating system with our  customer-centric products and services, providing a seamless experience to our users. The ETHA ecosystem is designed to deploy a futuristic financial service platform regarding an omnichannel and cross-functional customer journey. The ETHA ecosystem is developed as a solution for the following issues: \n\n#  1.2.1 Unbanked population \n\n In 2017, according to the World Bank, one-third of the world's population (2.5 billion) didn\u2019t have access to a financial institution with a formal account. The financial institutions have failed to provide infrastructure and access to affordable financial services in specific regions. We believe that with the ETHA ecosystem and token, we will strategically target and solve this issue. We can eliminate these barriers for those without a bank account due to account fees, paperwork and travel distances. This project also creates an excellent opportunity to potentially serve the underbanked and unbanked population to have access to the new era of financial services and payment solution systems. \n\n[ETHA](https://preview.redd.it/ojsgsyiir9c21.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=a874c5596d483ee656d89161e38477835ed24b0a)\n\n We will position ourselves through our innovation ecosystem and disruptive payment infrastructure to facilitate mainstream financial services through the ETHA platform and financial services for those in demand. \n\n[ETHA](https://preview.redd.it/i2nh8mikr9c21.png?width=219&format=png&auto=webp&s=04b0ab68f18a89a333a58ac4025849e9dbfda20c)\n\n[https://etharemit.org/](https://etharemit.org/)",

            "text": "The **Utrum** ecosystem relies on several functions for its operation. Get familiar with the terms usage, and these include:\n\ni. **OOT Tokens**: Utrum Tokens, called **OOT** tokens, are the cryptocurrency utility tokens used within the Utrum platform. As a utility, they are used by investors and other members to access in-depth technical analysis and market predictions. Members can use OOT to seek expert advice or buy and sell crypto-related services within the platform marketplace. Crypto developers can use OOT to make promotions. Contributors and members within Utrum also earn OOT tokens as rewards based on their contributions. Although OOT tokens are a utility token for use within the Utrum platform, OOT will also be able to be bought or sold outside the Utrum ecosystem on cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nii. **Trust Factor Credits (TFC)**: Trust Factor Credits, or TFC, are credits used exclusively within the Utrum platform. Members and contributors earn TFC for their predictions, analysis, and ratings. TFCs are used in calculating the appropriate OOT reward earned by an action.\n\niii. **Trust Factor Score (TFS)**: Trust Factor Score, or TFS, is a scoring system for translating community trust into a meaningful and measurable metric. A TFS is given to cryptocurrencies, ICOs, analysts and members. In simple terms, TFS reflects how many people in the community trust the information or member in question.\n\niv. **Member Vote Coefficient (MVC)**: All contributors within the platform may participate in any rating process. Every member has a coefficient, which begins as 1 by default. The coefficient is used to determine the weight of the voter. This is calculated using the end result of the rating process. This dynamic coefficient changes after every rating process, according to the accuracy of the voter as compared with the crowd decision.\n\nFind more details here : [https://utrum.io](https://utrum.io)",

This brings me to the last point, which I think is vital for blockchain technology mass adoption. Stable coins are the key to mass adoption. \n\nI\u2019ve been reading in the news that many countries are studying blockchain and considering issuing their own electronic currency. I mean this is great. I don\u2019t see cash disappearing suddenly but rather it will happen gradually. For countries to issue stable currencies, they will study the current stable coins, such as USDT, USDC, BUSD, DAI, etc. I think they will try to replace the model that these currencies use. The most interesting stable coin that I ran into recently is SUSD: https://bitcoinist.com/a-simple-explanation-of-the-samecoin-ecosystem-for-normal-people-like-joe/. The currency is pegged to a basket of other stable coins. I think the concept of pegging a stable coin to an Index is great. It just enforces stability and mitigates risk. What are your thoughts on this model?",

The market is facing a number of significant issues, which lead to confusion on the part of investors and the token platforms themselves:\n\n**Legal**: Many platforms and exchanges within the crypto sphere do not comply with current financial regulations, with countries even declaring them illegal. This is primarily due to these platforms holding limited liability and legal obligation to their users.\n\n**Immature Security**: Although blockchain itself is a very secure ledger, a lack of standardized security, along with the immense value of tokens on the platform make them a big opportunity for hackers. It is estimated that a total of USD 2.3 billion in crypto assets have been stolen so far due to lapses in security, mostly from exchanges.\n\n**User Knowledge**: Traditional investors are not used to the complex securities and technical skills required to operate and invest in digital securities. Cryptographic keys, transactions, operation of wallets and verification of tokens transfers can be overwhelming and many big investors still hesitate to venture into the blockchain sector.\n\n**Smart Valor: Creating Opportunities for Investments**\n\nKeeping the above mentioned issues in mind, a platform has been launched to cater for online investments with focus on digital assets. [**Smart Valor**](https://smartvalor.com/), the decentralized platform keeps in focus:\n\n**Cryptocurrencies**and other non-security tokens (for protocols, utility and payments within platform). With a growth of over 252% in the last 12 months, this is the kind of attraction that investors seek, but many are still not venturing due to the legal and other restrictive issues.\n\n**Asset backed security tokens**such as equity, real estate, crypto based funds etc., although, having less liquidity than cryptocurrencies, do have a higher rate of return and are more stable. This is the kind of interest that large scale investors, venture capitalists and private equity funds are more interested in.",

To be left out of such a powerful technology\u200a\u2014\u200aor fail to even get on the first rung of the ladder\u200a\u2014\u200acould impact the lives of many.\n\nEasy access to blockchain on one hand allows inclusion across a huge range of applications likely to be developed over coming years. Importantly, a better understanding of blockchain and cryptocurrencies as a whole will help people gain a level of independence that traditional technologies cannot deliver.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing this shift in public attitude with the backlash against Facebook and the toughening of data laws under GDPR. That sense of being in control of your information, and to certain degree your own destiny, focuses even more attention on making blockchain a tool for everyone, not just the technological elite.\n\nI think this is why Pigzbe is such a fascinating product. While our mission as a company is about financial education and inclusion, Pigzbe as a whole is the first product in my mind that provides a response to this real desire for a change in behaviour.",

The network is designed to scale-out by expanding current processing constraints linearly with the number of nodes without compromising decentralization while preserving long term security properties under a permission-less operation.\n\nThis is next-level blockchain tech and most likely will have pretty immediate adoption and high utilization after mainnet, so its going to moon hard (current cap is around $130m).\n\nIt uses a state of the art dual ledger comprised of a block lattice and a meta DAG which facilitate lighting fast confirmations of transactions on chain, and they have solved a bunch of other problems currently existing on layer 1 chains related to scaling and security and decentralized apps. Quantum resistant and Byzantine fault tolerant. This is going to be a big deal. Check out the whitepaper for preliminary info in this regard, and the yellowpaper being released will be a lot more technical.\n\nTestnet is already up and running and entered it's 2nd stage just recently, the testnet is incentivized so rewards can be earned.\n\nJoin the Telegram for more info.  \n[https://t.me/zenon\\_community](https://t.me/zenon_community)",

The tactic has always been the same, round up a worthless commodity, overhype its value and make a fortune in profit by selling it off to the unsuspecting victims.\n\nIn recent years, the blockchain industry has been plagued by \u201cPump and dump\u201d schemes and ICOs particularly have been a major target.\n\n In an ICO pump and dump scheme, a small group of individuals declares the availability of a new cryptocurrency, then they artificially inflate the coin\u2019s value through misinformation. \n\nThis invariably leads to a spike in the exchange rate of the coin in question for a short period of time. Finally, the coin is completely sold out at or before the peak of the coin\u2019s market value, invariably leaving unsuspecting buyers with nothing.\n \nFortunately, ICO market data carry some indicators of a potential pump and dump scheme. These indicators are quite revealing if analyzed with the right tools and algorithms. \n\nA couple of platforms on the crypto ecosystem have made it their responsibility to vet ICOs leveraging technology and expert understanding of the indicators of pump and dump schemes to be able to accurately identify ICO pump and dump schemes.

They're all faster than the problem solvers before them.\nThe 1% of cryptos are what I refer to as utility cryptos. \n\nI've long suspected that once utility cryptos become widely adopted, they'll be absorbed by relevant government bodies and industries, and will serve as the foundation and lifeblood of the sectors that rely on them. \n\nTake, for example, XRP. I expect to rarely, if ever, hear the words \"\"XRP takes over\"\" in the media once it begins to replace SWIFT or handle the derivatives market. Other widely used utility cryptos will follow suit... Other cryptocurrencies include XLM, Algo, Hbar, VeChain, Bob Eco Coin, and others.\n\nBob Eco Coin's involvement in these well-known projects may pique your interest. So I came across this and think it's a great project that stands out.\n\nThis project may now have a completely different value because it helps people find work in Africa, where there is almost no competition. Despite having very different functions, this is a relatively new project on the block that is creating thousands of jobs and declaring war on pollution through the world of Security Tokens. \nIt's also the first time a for-profit social enterprise has been tokenized anywhere in the world.

According to the official company website, the aim of\u00a0Noku\u00a0is to provide customers with a \u2018fast and reliable\u2019 monetary service all over the world.\nOne of the core benefits of using this technology is its ability to help make payments via the use of Noku tokens. When a transaction is made using this platform, the central operational unit automatically executes a conversion that is free of any transaction fee, and thus helps us\u00a0make trades in any currency\u00a0(crypto or fiat), as long as the transaction is taking place digitally.\nAs mentioned earlier, the Noku platform features an encrypted e wallet, that helps store all our valuable digital assets in the form of gold or any other fiat currency. All this is done digitally, without us having to move an inch from our computer screens.\nThis platform has also been designed to help us\u00a0buy/sell any fiat or digital currency\u00a0of our choice in a simple and efficient manner. All we have to do is choose a particular digital currency and add it to our personalized\u00a0trading\u00a0system. Once done, we have the option to either withdraw, trade or simply store the assets (all of the actions are conducted in real time).\nAs we can all see, we are currently living in a generation that has access to an unprecedented amount of data at the simple click of a button. Cryptocurrencies in particular have taken the global economic market by storm. Despite being limited due to their digital nature, these assets have a large potential to help solve problems of payments, money transfers that we face on a day to day basis.\nNOKU website : https://www.noku.io/\n\u00a0and\u00a0Noku Blog: https://blog.noku.io/",

This was an extension of DIVI\u2019s partnership with PolisPay a few months ago that added DIVI to their mobile wallet and added a lot of useful features. Now, you can set up a node on PolisPay using DIVI as currency.\n\nA DIVI community member from Canada is the first person to beta test the upcoming DIVI Mall application. It is basically an e-commerce platform, but with DIVI coins as payments. DIVI syrup is the first of such stores. From the store, you can order maple syrup, maple butter, and other products.\n\nDivi is creating the world's first closed-loop, vertically-integrated cryptocurrency ecosystem. Much like Apple's ecosystem is anchored by iCloud, the Divi Project blockchain serves as the core of the Divi network of technologies. Thanks to a keen understanding of the divide that separates the mainstream from the crypto world, the Divi team is able to create solutions to the industry's biggest problem: adoption by non-technical users. Divi's user-friendly, one-click solutions aim to bring blockchain-based payments into modernity with great UX. In this podcast, we will cover all aspects of cryptocurrency, hot topics, and technology as worldwide adoption grows.  \nListen to the full Podcast on:\n\nSound cloud:  [https://soundcloud.com/divi-404929935/ep36](https://soundcloud.com/divi-404929935/ep36)   \nYoutube; [https://youtu.be/mWyxNEvBy2U](https://youtu.be/mWyxNEvBy2U)",

And now every KABN client, which has passed KYC/AML on the KABN platform, has the right to receive Visa card issued by KABN and multicurrency banking wallet with high level of security. With the KABN card, customers can instantly convert cryptocurrency into fiat money and make payments in their daily lives, as well as access ATMs around the world, wherever Visa is accepted.\n\nIn addition, KABN offers clients the opportunity to verify their identity without providing confidential documentation to third parties. It is about KABN ID, an intuitive and free service for consumers, which provides constant monitoring and confirmation of identity on the Internet and on ordinary marketplaces. KABN ID is a patented process for verifying and confirming banking-level biometric identifiers, which, together with KYC/AML, provides the \u201cMarker\u201d in the blockchain, which can be used to verify a person\u2019s identity.\n\nThis technology fully complies with the requirements of the GDPR and stores only a binary marker, such as a Pass or Fail grade to your identification. No personal information is ever stored on the blockchain.\n\nImportant and unique is that the KABN ID registry can now be actively used as a database of participants who have been prequalified on the basis of permissions. KABN provides ICOs and exchanges, as well as other commercial operators, with the opportunity to reach large communities of targeted participants through the company's Whitelist service, providing incentives to the ICO, exchanges and the participants to engage.\n\nThese processes are required to ensure maximum customer security and KABN security.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7mpvhvd9gw21.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2844693f03b0e8d48e032d26dbe19aa786ba24c3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBounty0x username: lawyer",

When an incorrect answer is given, instead of \u201cburning\u201d the token like many other crypto projects do, the token the player would have won is donated to girls- or women-led charity, initiative, or business of their choice.\n\n**A** **Hybrid blockchain game built for mass adoption that is easy enough for a grandma or mom to play with her grandchildren or children.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe\u00a0**Undiscovered Story**\u00a0\u201cLearn & Earn\u201d Trivia Game will educate players on cross disciplinary innovators, creators and entrepreneurs who made positive contributions to their professions and society at large. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen participants answer questions incorrectly they will contribute to social good through the the games UDGT utility tokens (converted to local $USD fiat) being donated to vetted Girls or Women led initiatives or startups. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIncorrect answers also present a dual learning opportunity, through learning the name of a Undiscovered Story figures as well as learning about the Girls & Women led initiatives that funds are being donated to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE PROBLEM**\n\nAs the marketplace for distributed ledgers like Blockchain matures, many of the commercial products and services these technologies enable are suffering from ineffective and overly complicated on-boarding procedures that negatively impact customer acquisition and retention. Unless these products are easy to use, demonstrate clear value and provide accountability, transparency and trust, mass adoption will not happen.\n\n \n\n**THE SOLUTION**\n\nMany blockchain and cryptocurrency startups have been known to not have a substantive product, tangible asset or a marketing hook. These typical startup problems will be addressed through utilizing our \u201cOld school is the new school philosophy,\u201d based on our teams experience building and shipping enterprise applications. WIRD will build and release their blockchain product, the Undiscovered Story \u201cLearn & Earn\u201d game during April 2019.\n\nThe primary focus will initially be on girls and women Undiscovered Story \u0301s. This will not only motivate and inspire the next group of pioneers who will emerge from our global community but alsoNdrive competition to support the growth and marketing of the UDGT gaming economy.\n\nThe Undiscovered Story \u201cLearn & Earn\u201d Trivia Game is a casual Progressive Web Application (PWA) that will work seamlessly whether on the desktop, tablets or and mobile devices. The game will educate players on cross disciplinary innovators, creators and entrepreneurs who made positive contributions to their professions and society at large. It is a game that celebrates the past and present achievements of Girls and Women from every continent catalyzing social impact through digital gaming. Though the game itself does not teach cryptocurrency usage, using the game affords that opportunity. By playing the game the participants can easily manage their crypto currency, and thus will become part of the cryptocurrency economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **The Undiscovered Story Game Token** \n\nCoin Name: UDGT\n\nTotal Suppy: 350,000,000\n\nNetwork: Stellar\n\n \n\n\\#wirdwrld #undiscoveredstorygame\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: https://wirdwrld.io/undiscovered-story\n\nWhitepaper: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11RkSGFzlTYtSEdAIDw6qPZlvYniY4ggU/view?usp=sharing",

A specific community can be built around Wollo, connecting children with family and loved ones. Wollo ownership fosters and reinforces a higher level of brand affinity with the Pigzbe application and significantly increases the strength of network effects, promoting user growth and loyalty. \n\nGenerating our own token ensures Pigzbe users are the ones in charge. Following acceptance from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), Pigzbe plans to distribute part of its decision-making process in the project across its community of users. Holding Wollo would then entitle users to suggest and vote on proposals for the project development roadmap, helping make decisions on which new features to implement or discard. Supplying our own token also allows for the development of strong network schemes that promote dissemination and sale of Pigzbe devices, the proliferation of family networks, and the use of Wollo. \n\nUsing Wollo also allows us to create a unique coin with functional branding in order to foster a clear understanding of cryptocurrency values like decentralisation, volatility and exchange. The branding is, of course, not only functional, but also aesthetic, and will help in the building of a strong community based on trust that will grow and identify with a unique cryptocurrency designed for families and children. There will be a fixed total supply of Wollo and zero inflation in terms of supply. This will be publicly auditable on the decentralised network. \n\nWollo token owners can be certain that there will be no possibility that their holdings will be diluted by increasing the token supply. Wollo will be a Stellar-based token. \n\nThe capabilities that Wollo tokens inherit by being on the Stellar network align perfectly with the needs of the Pigzbe DApp. Wollo transactions between family members are extremely cost efficient. A single transaction costs 1/100,000 of one Stellar Lumen (XLM) in network fees. Wollo transfers between one family member and another are settled within 3 to 5 seconds, regardless of where you are in the world. Wollo Tokens will also be tradable on the SDEX against other tokens and fiat currencies supported on the network. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.pigzbe.com](https://www.pigzbe.com)",

Javvy approaches cryptocurrency from a compliance and regulation-first perspective, and is powered by a team with decades of extensive regulatory, compliance, programming, and security experience. The cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy.\n\nAs a result, lack of information and the absence of easily-identifiable best practices, has led crypto users to resort to combining feature-poor, and often insecure, crypto utilities to obtain and manage their cryptocurrency. We, the Javvy team, decided that there is a better way. We are consolidating the full functionality of cryptocurrency into a previously nonexistent, comprehensive solution with a focus on security, simplicity, and keeping the control of cryptocurrency where it belongs, in the hands of its owners\n\n[https://javvy.com/](https://javvy.com/)",

It uses smart contract technologies to launch campaigns instantly. Here\u2019s a basic explanation of blockchain technologies & cryptographic algorithms.\n\n* Blockchain technology is a method for distributed transaction processing and storage. This should be distinguished from cryptocurrency which is a digital representation of apparent perceived value.\n* Blockchains consist of sets of transactions that are sealed within a \u201cblock\u201d using cryptographic algorithms.\n* Blockchain transactions are maintained in a distributed ledger that is kept in conformity across the nodes in the network via consensus algorithms.\n\n**Ichiba offers founders a pre-built platform to run their own ICOs**. This gives rapid crowdfunding potential to any project by eliminating the following major issues which are barriers in the ICO market.",

To add to that,  by using our platform, investors can find the best managers with  transparent ratings from around the world, and build trust with one  another due to all transactions being done through the blockchain.\n\n**What problems does it solve?**\n\nCurrently,  few investors have the knowledge to consistently and successfully  profit in the market compared to the number of those with experience in  the more familiar but much less rewarding traditional markets. There is  now a fitting solution for investors who would rather not manage their  savings on their own: CINDX. CINDX allows absolutely anyone to invest in  the crypto market, and see returns without possessing any specialized  knowledge or skill.\n\nCINDX  provides a platform that allows any investor to choose a manager for  his or her portfolio and securely trade cryptocurrencies for a  reasonable success fee.\n\n**What kind of users does the platform target?**\n\nVarious  components of the platform are made for Investors, Managers and Vendors  (software providers and analysts), and facilitate the interactions  between them efficiently and transparently.\n\n**How can investors verify their manager\u2019s track record?**\n\nEvery  trade executed within the CINDX ecosystem is recorded on the  blockchain, allowing CINDX users to easily access verifiable trading  success history. This information feeds a unique ranking system which  allows CINDX users to browse through a list of world-class Managers and  view their performance, statistics and other pertinent information. The  platform selects the best trading strategies applied by traders using  its own rating system and adds them to the marketplace. The Investors  choose the strategies that are optimal for them via their personal  exchange accounts without any transfers of funds.\n\nFor more please visit [medium](https://medium.com/cindx/frequently-asked-questions-about-cindx-692cae405d6?fbclid=IwAR1yq81l1dMDaK5e4HSf7JMdb1rlyrFK4C5gcR-mlZnKddWn5FRaTJxe0zg)\n\nFor much more please visit [https://cindx.io/](https://cindx.io/)",

Along with sharding, this protocol architecture allows for scalability, security and decentralizaQon. The game theoreQcal and economical basis for this is outlined in the Yellow Paper, with further technical details on implementaQon. This is the backbone technology that allows Neutro to scale in a decentralized way.\n\nExogenous Data\n\nAssimilaQng external data into the blockchain currently relies upon oracles. These are vulnerable to manipulaQon or to censorship, and effecQvely render any system that includes them a centralized one. We use Schelling Point schemes to arrive at externally-derived values for any data points. This Schelling Point scheme is incorporated into the protocol itself and provides necessary incenQves and disincenQves to produce a kind of a \u201cmarket for informaQon\u201d. We show here that this is not only a novel approach to a truly decentralized system; it affords a wide range of applicaQons, becoming the backbone of a future real-world trustless economy. It allows the cryptocurrency to be as versaQle as any market, and Neutro as versaQle as any asset. In the points above, we outline a system with efficiency and scalability that is completely decentralized and as diverse as real world financial markets. There are sQll two key barriers to access for many, which we aim to solve here.\n\nAnonymity\n\nAnonymity is important. For example, banking transacQons are private; any soluQon that hopes to compete with the established system must have at least the same capability. Neutro will allow anonymous transacQons by part-encrypQon of the transacQon message in the part containing the transacQon amount (amounts) and beneficiary-address (addresses), encrypQng it using the public key of the block producer and conQnuously repeaQng the process. This soluQon (described in detail in the Yellow Paper) allow anonymity to be efficiently given to the transactors in a secure way.",

Cryptocurrencies are a kind of alternative currency and digital currency (of which virtual currency is a subset). Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.\n\n*While this revolution is gaining wide acceptance, PUBLISH Protocol came with a mission to create a highly-accessible and global blockchain-based media platform that fairly rewards writers and readers, and serves as a realistic and economically viable model for publishers to adopt and build on. The protocol will also serve as a deterrence to fake news by offering greater transparency and accuracy of news and information that derives from its participatory mode of news.*\n\nThe first use of the PUBLISH Protocol technology will be a well-known blockchain-media Korean company called TokenPost.\n\nIn the course of its professional activities, the company will use the NEWS token.\u00a0Token NEWS was created by the PUBLISH Protocol team\u2019s own forces for the convenience of its users.",

Crowdfunding is a type of fund-raising for a business or a thought through the aggregate endeavors of a gathering of individuals, and the cases for drawing in such speculations can be very extraordinary. Assets raised through crowdfunding can't ensure results for members, and in a wide sense don't oblige the organizers to anything. All things considered, the crowdfunding market has a multi-billion dollar capitalization and just builds each year, and as per a few data, will defeat the characteristic of 300 billion dollars throughout quite a long while. \n\n \n\nCrowdfunding has turned out to be mainstream for a few reasons, including the way that individuals are attempting to sidestep the saving money load, and in addition the enormous achievement of numerous new businesses who have picked crowdfunding as the fundamental instrument for at first raising starting capital. Clear instances of such new businesses are the companies Oculus Rift and Pebble Smartwatch, which are currently world acclaimed. In any case, a significant number of the thoughts that assembled speculation through crowdfunding stayed at the dimension of the thought. This obviously essentially undermines the believability of this region. The issue of trust is a noteworthy one that requires an answer for crowdfunding. A conceivable answer for this issue could be the decentralized Pledgecamp application.\n\nWhat is Pledgecamp ?  \nPledgecamp is a decentralized project that hopes to unwind longstanding issues of trust and misaligned customer sparks in crowdfunding.\n\n \n\nThe guideline purpose of Pledgecamp project is to change the current crowdfunding model with a supporter Insurance escrow exhibit using smart contracts. Again, the stage expects to discards go betweens and pariah organizations in endeavor crowdfunding strategy to save creator money; and moreover gives full features, instruments and organizations to make your fight productive, giving simple crowdfunding exertion to producers.\n\nAdvantages of PLEDGECAMP\n\nPledgecamp offers security to supporters as Backer Insurance and straightforwardness requirements for creators.\n\nBlockchain empowers customers to mediate inquiry and accreditation cash related execution without requiring a pariah go between or overseer.\n\nA decentralized business focus further empowers individuals to be compensated for their duties to the system, and to empower all people to join paying little regard to geology or economics.\n\nA neighborhood token ensures that inspirations are balanced, incredible direct is redressed, and that customers advantage when their exercises lead to the prosperity and advancement of the system.\n\nPledgecamp Competitive Advantage Over Others:\n\nPledgecamp is increasingly open to any business, and you don't really need to run ICO projects so as to get financed by means of Pledgecamp, despite the fact that the best approach to contribute is by means of cryptocurrency.\n\nBacker insurance model is progressively feasible in the long haul contrasted with the break insurance strategy. Break insurance arrangement just spotlights on momentary additions of the token cost, while it doesn't ensure that project will succeed and on the off chance that you place it in another perspective, just present a siphon conspire by the projects to guarantee that token cost won't fall underneath ICO cost for 48 hours. From that point forward, they can simply leave the project or essentially said the advancement will get put off, etc.\n\nThere is no chance to get for supporters of get included further in the battle in Coinchase, while Pledgecamp permits to do it.\n\nConclusion:  \nThe crowdfunding business is defective. Blockchain and smart contracts may be the key answer for fix it, yet it generally relies upon how we will use it. Pledgecamp probably won't be the first who endeavors to utilize blockchain and smart contracts to explain it, yet it is certainly the primary who can think of a decent component. It is unquestionably worth to look at it.\n\nWebsite: [https://pledgecamp.com/](https://pledgecamp.com/)  \nWhitepaper: [https://pledgecamp.com/\\_\\_pdf/whitepaper-pledgecamp-9-23.pdf](https://pledgecamp.com/__pdf/whitepaper-pledgecamp-9-23.pdf)\n\nBounty0x ID: ecamli",

The main objective is to further develop the financial system applied in daily life. This financial system will cover a variety of things that require him to pay some money. The financial system carried by this platform is realized through the exchange of digital assets consisting of digital coins with other digital currencies. This change will provide the benefits that people passionate about this event can now do more in a more practical way through Volentix. These functions are almost the same as those offered on other digital platforms. Volentix offers new decorations in the form of facilities that make it even more special.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo do this, a volentix first learns in-depth. The market situation of the cryptocurrency must be understood as a whole so that they do not behave wrong in making decisions. Since the main objective of the volentix is to facilitate financial exchange transactions, every procedure must be followed easily by each user. They can't understand this system better. Therefore, facilities provided by the volentix should be able to support all levels of understanding that each user has. They did this with the construction of a website specifically aimed at managing this change activity. With attractive and easy-to-use layouts and designs, users can easily perform their digital operations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe digital exchange function, managed by volentix, aims to increase the adoption of the use of digital currencies in people's lives. The cryptocurrency market is currently filled with a variety of digital currencies available in various types and functions. In order to support the development of the community economy, this system should be further improved. The various benefits and advantages gained through the volentix plant can directly help users generate more revenue from this system. In fact, some people see this change as their main profession. Of course, it needs to be managed correctly in order to achieve the main goals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6zbhpj8re131.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8ccbd12589a4bff910e5e4c36c51e0b1859d654\n\nThe success of a transaction cannot be separated from the role of technology. The technology used by volentix, [EOS.IO](https://EOS.IO) is a blockchain supported by the smart contract program concept. All transactions carried out with the presence of this smart contract will be more directed and the purpose will be realized correctly. In addition, the process is faster when users do not have to face a delay in processing time. This process of change is made between the spouses. This means that any computer device that has access to the volentix network can easily process other computers. This is a benefit of the use of blockchain technology in it. Every computer accessing the volentix platform will be connected directly to the device and can complete a transaction immediately.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVolentix provides a system of change that takes place in a decentralized manner. This can ensure the transparency of each user's transaction data. All track records of transactions performed on this network can be viewed by other users who have very easy access. The security system is the most important thing that Volentix continues to develop on its network. Every user can safely handle this platform because various security efforts have been developed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother advantage of volentix is that it can support a large number of operations. The network created by volentix has demonstrated its reliability to facilitate a variety of currency trading transactions. Volentix carefully created the network system to be able to accept transaction requests from anyone and at any time. Volentix will provide a quick service process every time, both in busy times and in leisure time. This ensures that this platform has excellent scalability and is able to compete with competitors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVolentix will continue to develop digital platform functionality and ultimately provide greater convenience to the community. In order to improve the adoption of digital currencies, the public must definitely support it through a continuous exchange. Volentix supports the exchange of other currencies, so this platform can adjust its steps by providing greater access to exchange transactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xnbxyom9re131.jpg?width=1630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3bd299e9e2f356bf6ed127b5a18493098a70dc7f\n\nVolentix introduces a digital assets ecosystem (DAE) incorporating a decentralized digital assets exchange connected with a secure multi-currency cross-blockchain peer-to-peer wallet, a user-friendly market-ratings analytical interface, and an incentive-based recruitment program.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vision**\n\nCentralized trading of digital assets is marked by a history of security failures.

The platform has been developed as a result of problems associated with cryptocurrency mining. These problems include;\n\n* The amount of power consumed for mining cryptocurrencies.\n* Increase in cost of mining.\n* Environmental impacts of the excessive power consumption.\n\nThese negative factors have led to the development of a new mining method which is termed \u201ctrading mining\u201d. This is a process through which mining is being done by cryptocurrency traders and investors while they trade any coin listed on the exchange platform. Catex will offer a 5% bonus on all mining processes to cryptocurrency traders so as to encourage more people to participate in mining.   \n\nwww.catex.io",

Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.\n\n***While this revolution is gaining wide acceptance Blockmason\u2019s Link is a new blockchain infrastructure-as-a-service that allows app, web and other software developers to use smart contracts and programmatic blockchains like TRON in their applications without requiring any blockchain experience. Using Link, a developer can create classic, conventional web-based APIs for any smart contract written on a programmatic blockchain. At the heart of Link is BLINK, the utility token which provides Link users with API transactions.***\n\nBlockmason Link creates classic, traditional web-based APIs for any smart contract written on a programmatic block chain. After giving information about Blockmason Link with a brief description in the introduction section, let\u2019s try to understand Blockmason Link project better by explaining the concrete problems of the project in the development section.\n\nWith the rapid development of technology, changes occur in the world. These changes create differences in the habits of people. While the Internet technology in the past promised a different world for people, the crypto money sector now offers the same promises for people. Therefore, many projects and platforms are emerging in this area. Many of these are sloppy processes, damaging people\u2019s trust. This distrust is reflected in the sector over time. In addition, it does its job well in some projects and wants to be able to take its place in the change mentioned above and to be the first to respond to people\u2019s wishes. It is also necessary to distinguish these projects from others. The Blockmason Link project is a quality project that makes it good and trusting at this point.",

XERA will provide the professional tools and resources that traders require for precise trade execution. XERA is currently establishing partnerships with professionals from various industries to assist in the development of a robust trading platform. The overall objectives of the platform are to:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Deliver an integrated cryptocurrency trading platform to traders and investors;\n\n\\*Establish itself as having the most in-demand capabilities within the cryptocurrency exchange market; and\n\n\\*Attract and retain a team of credible partners and team members with a proven record of success within the realm of cryptocurrency, thereby delivering an exceptional trading experience to XERA customers\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore specifically, XERA is positioned to offer traders and investors detailed reporting, advanced charting features, one cancels other (OCO) order features, multiple order types, price alert system, real-time profit and loss updates, and competitive trading fees. Whether a cryptocurrency beginner or advanced trader, everyone is welcome on the XERA platform.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE XERA EXCHANGE**\n\nThe XERA exchange will commence as a cryptocurrency-only exchange. This means that cryptocurrencies may only be purchased using other cryptocurrencies on the platform. We understand the benefits of incorporating fiat onto our exchange since Fiat currency continues to be superior in liquidity when compared to cryptocurrency and adding this to the exchange will increase the number of participants. More participants equals to a higher volume on the exchange thus boosting liquidity. As the exchange grows and develops, fiat currency will be accepted. One of the primary unique value propositions of the XERA exchange centers on the suite of capabilities available to traders on our platform. For our inaugural launch, XERA will support trading in the following coins:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*BTC (All coins can be traded with BTC)\n\n\\*ETH (will be disclosed later, what coins can be traded with ETH)\n\n\\*XERA coin (All coins can be traded with XERA)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, we will add other cryptocurrencies based on a careful assessment of their demand, as the trader onboarding progresses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EXCHANGE FEATURES**\n\nThere are several features on the XERA exchange that will make the trading experience far superior to other cryptocurrency exchanges. An overview of the key components of the XERA platform is outlined below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTWO INTERFACES: BASIC AND ADVANCED\n\nThe recently established sector of cryptocurrency trading has attracted a generation of new traders and investors \u2013 both experienced and inexperienced. However, many cryptocurrency exchanges can be difficult to navigate for both beginner and professional traders alike. To resolve this challenge, XERA is developing two interfaces: basic and advanced. The basic interface will be intuitive and easy for beginner traders, while the advanced interface will have extensive charting features and technical indicators across multiple timeframes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMULTI-DEVICE STANDARDIZED FEATURES\n\nWhether XERA users are trading from their laptop, or via their mobile device, our platform features will be developed to work seamlessly across all devices and apps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPRICE ALERTS\n\nWith the XERA platform, traders will be able to set SMS and email alerts for a variety of indicators including, but not limited to:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*MACD\n\n\\*RSI\n\n\\*Bollinger Bands\n\n\\*Stochastics\n\n\\*Momentum Oscillators\n\n\\*Moving Averages\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur Price Alert function will signal a trader when the price of a cryptocurrency reaches a level they have been monitoring. Traders currently have to use third-party tools for this purpose, but this will be fully integrated within the XERA platform.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nREAL-TIME PROFIT AND LOSS UPDATES ACROSS TIME FRAMES\n\nTraders will be able to view their profit and loss in real-time as a percentage and in BTC across time frames of 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHE XERA TOKEN\n\nThe XERA token can be used by traders to reduce their trading fees and through our token buyback monetary policy, continue to generate additional value for their cryptocurrency portfolio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTRADING INFORMATION AND HOW-TO GUIDES\n\nThere will be an automated tutorial section that will help new traders learn trading in the easiest possible manner. Be it the UI, withdrawals or expert level trades, you will have access to understand, learn, implement and improve your trading with the help of visuals, voice & AI.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBUILT-IN TRADING AUTOMATION\n\nXERA provides a scripting environment for trade automation that allows traders to implement their trading strategies via direct coding so that the trades get executed autoomatically based on user implemented logic. Users will have access to all market data, technical indicators, account balance, open orders & trade history via scripting. The exchange will also provide a simplified interface for users to configure indicators, set up certain conditions, and perform trades automatically\n\n&#x200B;\n\nXERA\u2019S RESERVE LIQUIDITY POOL\n\nWhile there are a multitude of factors that determine the liquidity of a particular asset (or compendium of assets), one of the wellknown methods for mitigating price volatility, i.e, providing price stability for asset exchange, is through the implementation of a liquidity pool. Increasing the likelihood of cryptocurrency liquidity is one of the mass adoption cornerstones. To ensure a continual state of healthy liquidity via the XERA exchange, we will transfer 10% of the monthly profits to the Reserve Liquidity Pool. We estimate that, by end of year 3, the total Reserve Liquidity Pool will contain $2.25 million.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.xera.tech/](https://www.xera.tech/)\n\n&#x200B;",

By building a comprehensive, secure, and  intuitive crypto wallet with buy, sell,  \nconvert, and management  capabilities, Javvy is powered by a team with decades of extensive  regulatory, compliance, programming, and security experience.\n\nJavvy  proposes its crypto solution for users to overcome all barriers to  adoption with a regulation-first approach, defining a carefully crafted  business infrastructure and multi-tiered risk mitigation policy. The  technology framework is then built on that solid foundation. The  consumer-facing front-end of the Javvy solution couples, by exclusive  integration, a crypto wallet with the world\u2019s first distributed, fully  automated, cross-currency exchange. The combination of a properly  designed crypto exchange with a safe, intuitive, and feature-rich crypto  wallet, and a capable team is what sets the Javvy crypto solution  apart.\n\nThe Javvy solution is not  web-based, avoiding the inherent risks of traditional web-based  financial services. Additionally, Javvy's technology is designed to  isolate core components, according to regulatory type and AML policy  restrictions. By taking this regulatory-centric approach, Javvy is able  to provide anyone in the world, who has Internet connectivity and is not  barred from cryptocurrency by their country's policy, full access to  the  \ncryptocurrency markets. Specifically, the Javvy architecture separates key functions that do not require  \nregistration  from those that do. As a result of Javvy's regulatory-centric approach,  users do not need to register or have address and identity verified for  send, receive, manage, or convert operations. If a user desires to  purchase or sell cryptocurrency,they will then be asked to register and  provide the minimal ID verification documents, as per their country of  citizenship. The mobile apps will provide easy methods to upload  pictures of documents and desktop apps will allow for easy upload of  scanned documents, all sent to secure Javvy servers for rapid  verification.",

The Platform is geared towards low cost, fast transactions and speed, and removing complexities in how users view the Blockchain. Faster adoption won't come if the chance isn't given to all and sundry to experience the blockchain and Cryptocurrency in an easy manner. What are the features that make [XCOYNZ](https://xcoynz.com/) stand out from its peers?\n\n1. Unlike other Platforms where fees are a fixed percentage, Xcoynz gives users the leeway to set their own fee. This is really a one in a kind offer that is unique only to this Platform.\n2. Exchanges from crypto to Fiat is now made seamless with Xcoynz with the exchange proceeds going directly to our bank accounts. The first Fiat currency will be the British Pound Sterling with the US dollar and Euro coming in later phases.\n3. The Smart Algorithm Wallet (SAW) of the Xcoynz platform makes it possible for users that have assets in multiple wallets to be able to integrate them via \"Machine learning algorithms\" and will make recommendations on the best possible path for a low transfer and exchange fees. SAW can also provide advice on cryptocurrencies users can Hodl for the long, short or middle term.\n4. With the Xcoynz payment gateway, goods and services can now be bought and sold using cryptocurrencies as payments. This is one of the major reasons digital assets have been on the backline. Investors had to exchange them back to fiat before they can make use of it. But with Xcoynz, that's in the past because the exchange wouldn't need to be done anymore. Goods and services are now paid for directly.\n5. With the Xcoynz Smart Cards, users can now purchase anything they want from retailers using the Smartcards. Withdrawal of Fiat is also made possible and access to digital assets is instant.\n\nAll these bring about an easier way for newbies and even the experienced to familiarize themselves with the blockchain in the easiest manner possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite - [https://xcoynz.com](https://xcoynz.com/)  \nWhitepaper - [https://xcoynz.com/WhitePaper-Full.html](https://xcoynz.com/WhitePaper-Full.html) \n\nbounty0x: hashin",

The Guider.Travel platform creates a smart contract that enables users to make payments in fiat money, credit or debit cards, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe platform holds the payment and at the end of the tour if users are pleased with the services the guide offered, the guide receives the payment after the platform deducts its commission. Similarly, the smart contract created on the platform records the history of the guide on the blockchain, where other users can view it.\n\nThe GDR tokens are the platform\u2019s utility tokensthat can be used to pay for services on the platform. The tokens can be purchased on any exchange listed on the Guider.Travel website.\n\nFor more information : https://guider.travel/",

Many Blockchain-based companies  have very little substance behind them. However, CINDX actually has  something very robust. I think that CINDX is particularly distinctive  because **even trading platforms lack the vision to bring an entire ecosystem of traders, investors, and vendors together as CINDX does**; allowing all participants to monetize their skills and earn real value.  \nWhat excites me even more about CINDX developing its platform to support this ecosystem is what I would call a kind of **\u201cdemocratization\u201d of the cryptocurrency trading space**.  By capitalizing on those who are more skilled at currency trading, our  platform actually provides a level-playing field for investors to  individually decide who to invest with using a bona-fide risk profile  and recorded trading history.\n\nFor more please visit [medium](https://medium.com/cindx/the-cindx-team-jason-king-9a1b93d6aa8b)\n\nFor much more please visit [https://cindx.io/](https://cindx.io/)",

As a result of the disruptive technology of the blockchain which comes with outstanding features including Transparency, immutability, security, Decentralization etc, a lot of businesses in different sectors of the world\u2019s economy have leverage on these characteristics to enhance their businesses, and e- commerce sector is not left out.\n\nHowever, irrespective of the unique characteristics and benefits accompanying the use of cryptocurrencies for transactions in businesses, so many business owners are yet to adopt this technology. This is as a result of the difficulty involves in the real life usage of theses digital currencies. A lot of merchants still prefer the traditional Fiat currency transaction system. Therefore there was a need to create a project such as CHIMPION which will encourage the acceptance and real life usage of cryptocurrencies.\n\nCHALLENGES WITH CRYPTO PAYMENT ADOPTION\n\nThe adoption of cryptocurrencies as means of payment for goods and services is having a hard time due to the following issues:\n\n* Difficulty in understanding the real life usage of cryptocurrency: it looks stressful trying to adopt the use of crypto currencies especial to those who are not familiar with the blockchain technology.\n* Low level of acceptability of cryptocurrencies in Exchange for goods and services by merchants.\n* Lack of proper infrastructures put in place to enable effective cryptocurrency payments.\n* Difficult user interface which discourages merchants as well as customers from venturing into cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nCHALLENGES WITH TRADITIONAL FIAT PAYMENT OPTION\n\nLike the saying goes, everything has advantages and disadvantages; in as much as people are trying to run away from adopting the amazing features of crypto currencies and the blockchain technology, there are also some factors limiting the success of e commerce when using Fiat currencies especially in some areas where people do not have essay access to the traditional bank services. Some of such factors may include:\n\ni. unnecessary High transaction charges .  \nii. Inability to assess online banking facilities in some areas.  \niii. Lack of transparency in payment, some hidden charges is applied due to the use of middle men.  \niv. Inadequate security tools put in place to checkmate fraudulent activities.  \nv. Difficult, long and delayed payment methods\n\nREASON FOR THE CREATION OF CHIMPION\n\nTaking into consideration the need to promote E- commerce globally without barriers and encourage mass adoption of cryptocurrencies as means of payments for goods and services Chimpion was created to leverage on the innovative features of blockchain technology. Although a few merchants have stated accepting cryptocurrencies as means for payment, the main aim of Chimpion creation was to create an enabling environment where more Merchants globally would accept this digital currency thereby adding more value to e -commerce industries.\n\nOUTSTANDING CHARACTERISTICS OF CHIMPION PLATFORM  \nChimpion is designed as an innovative platform that will enable Merchants to easily, effectively efficiently and securely accept crypto payments in exchange for their products via the following tools:  \ni. Chimpion digital wallet which allows users to either makes payments with crypto or with Fiat currencies anywhere and at anytime.\n\nii. Chimpion Point of Sale (POS) : this also makes it possible for customers to pay promptly for goods and services .\n\niii. Instant delivery of goods without worrying about the issues that accompanies charge back processes.\n\niv. Using Chimpion platform, it is easy for any merchants around the globe to establish a shop where people pay using  \ncrypto currency.\n\nv. with Chimpion all that is requires is for Merchants to stake their CHIMP tokens and immediately begin placing their goods and services for global sales.\n\nvi. The integration of Paytomat wallet gives Chimpion users the opportunity to accept payment with their hardware within their stores.\n\nvii. Selling on chimpion platform with cryptocurrency helps merchants to avoid unnecessary high transaction fees charges when using Fiats. With crypto a merchant will only pay a very low transaction fee irrespective of whether the transaction is local or international.\n\nViii. One other unique thing about Chimpion is that Merchants have the privilege of deciding whether to collect payment with CHIMP token or convert it to any stable other stable coins which they desire.\n\nCHIMPION DUAL TOKEN\n\nChimpion platform makes use of two different tokens, CHIMP and BNANA token.  \nCHIMP token is the main token of the ecosystem which will be used for incentives and bounty payments to merchants. CHIMP will be the main token used in buying and selling on the Chimpion platform.  \nBNANA token is used as payment for rewards, when a user buys form the platform using CHIMP he or she is entitled to some BNANA. This is to further encourage the use of cryptocurrency in real life purchase of goods and services.\n\nBENEFITS OF CHIMP TOKEN TO HOLDERS  \ni. Holders gain free access to the Chimpion platform  \nii. Holders of CHIMP only stakes their CHIMP to be able to place their goods and services for sale on Chimpion platform  \niii. Users of CHIMP in paying for goods and services receive BNANA token as rewards, and the more they use CHIMP for payment, the more BNANA they receive without limits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [https://www.chimpion.io/](https://www.chimpion.io/)\n\nWhitepaper: [https://www.chimpion.io/whitepaper/](https://www.chimpion.io/whitepaper/)\n\nBounty0x ID: ecamli",

As stated in the whitepaper, imusify\u2019s unique value proposition is the use of blockchain to track content and smart contracts to automate the fair distribution of royalties. But beyond this, imusify has created a platform for all users to interact and contribute to a new form of economy where fair payouts are a reality. Music curators, in this perspective, are also incentivized to participate in the ecosystem. We can imagine imusify serving as a networking space, a curating tool, a discussion forum, and much more: pretty much all we can find in the music industry which is currently offered by centralized parties or services failing at rewarding their users efficiently.\n\nBased on an efficient reward-system powered by IMU \u2014 imusify native cryptocurrency \u2014 music curators are encouraged to discover new music and create music playlists. Once a playlist is created and shared with the community of the curator, he or she receives IMU Tokens proportionate to its active contribution. What\u2019s different with a former music curation role, let\u2019s say in the current streaming platforms? Well, on these platforms, curators are not compensated for their time to find great music, nor to share it. Unless they land a job at Amazon or Deezer, the everyday music curator (which can be me or you) simply \u201cwaste\u201d time finding music and creating music playlists that will mainly benefit the service provider. On imusify, not only music curators are paid for their time, but the music they share helps artists receive fairer payouts, thanks to smart contracts which track the \u201cuse\u201d of a song in the blockchain space.\n\nNow, everyday music curation deserves the best. As Spotify got sued in 2015 for distributing music to Tidal without the consent of artists, we believe the music industry is in need of total transparency over songs management and royalties payment. In this purpose, imusify can help solve such pitfalls by offering a new music curation platform that keeps track of royalties payment and also rewards its users for their active participation. Let\u2019s enter the new music economy powered by innovative blockchain platforms like imusify.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://imusify.com/](https://imusify.com/)",

Crowdfunding has emerged as one of the major financing systems for new enterprises and since the rise of cryptocurrencies, the famed ICOs \u2014 Initial Coin Offerings have helped to establish a new way to obtain funds.\n\nA few years have passed by, but both these systems still show a lot of weaknesses and inherent problems that cross in the way of people trying to setup their enterprise.\n\nCrowdfunding still heavily relies on centralized platforms that lack the transparency and usually have high fees, lacking the power to grab a larger audience.\n\nThe famed ICOs are loosing investors interest and the failure rate has reached new highs. The majority of the teams are non-professional and unprepared, the scam percentage is huge, there are ICO advisors popping out everywhere and asking for high fees to do almost nothing\u2026 all these together almost brought the market to it\u2019s knees.\n\nThis is where Ichiba comes in, supplying the way to efficiently and safely raise money for legit fundraising campaigns. Ichiba is creating a new way to bond blockchain technology with the crowdfunding machine, creating a marketplace serving investors and fundraisers, connecting them and eliminating the bumps on the road.\n\nIf we think about this, Ichiba is bringing together the $7 billion ICO market and the $20 billion crowdfunding market, creating a global market for fundraising of new innovative enterprises. They will be using smart contract technology to power their blockchain based platform and to crete a global market for efficient and safe fundraising campaigns. This will bring the trust of both investors and entrepreneurs to the next level and allow these new ideas and these new leaders to thrive.",

Some of them are used to share the joyful events of life, to talk about travel or to report their own achievements in a particular area. Others can get the information they need through social networks.*\n\n**However, the existing social networks are far from perfect, have a number of problems and need modernization. Among the most common problems causing user dissatisfaction can be identified:**\n\n* *lack of freedom of choice, which is why people view all the content of a certain person, not just the materials that cause them interest;*\n* *lack of privacy settings, which does not allow to show photos and records to a certain group of people, and demonstrates them to all subscribers;*\n* *no possibility to create content together with friends or colleagues;*\n* *no search engine for people with similar interests;*\n* *lack of data on the interests of subscribers, which could allow to create really interesting content.*\n\n***The solution to all these problems will be the Cedium project, which will create a new generation of social network Corld, based on Blockchain technology.***\n\n# Project objective\n\nThe main goal of the creators of the Cedium project is to develop a social network based on cooperation, collectivization, joint creativity, as well as a joint economy.\n\n \n\n# Principle of operation\n\nTo achieve this goal, the developers of the social network *Corld* intend to use 2 products \u2013 *Cedium* tokens (CEU) and the Journey control system.\n\n**Particular attention should be paid to the Journey system, which will give users of the new social network full control over the content. Due to this system, users will be able to:**\n\n* *keep track of specific events in the life of a person or different topics, and not for the profile, simultaneously viewing a number of uninteresting content;*\n* *post content with limited access, which will be visible only to specified individuals and not to all subscribers;*\n* *create joint events by sharing content shot on different devices by a group of people within the same story;*\n* *find social network members with similar interests;*\n* *view the full statistics taking into account the division of the audience members by interests, age, place of residence and gender, with the aim of exploring interests, and creating more quality and interesting content.*\n\n \n\nIf desired, each user will be able to interact with a special section of the social network called the *Corld* Ad Platform, designed to interact with users and advertisers. In this section, advertisers will be able to select the users with the most subscribers interested in their product, and users will be able to choose advertising for future placement. Payment for advertising services will be carried out using the internal coin of the platform. It is important to note that users receive a portion of the revenue generated by advertising.\n\n Due to the fact that the *Corld* will be the first social network in the world to use virtual currency, that is why the developers have created an internal secure wallet to store the coins of the platform and their use. Unlike most cryptocurrency wallets, the *Corld* Wallet is created automatically when users install the social network application. Such a solution will be very convenient for users who do not have deep knowledge in the world of virtual currencies. \n\n \n\nThe main financial means of the platform will be *CEU* coins, which can be purchased during *TDE.*\n\n# Dates and details of the TDE\n\nThe creators of the project intend to implement within the TDE 160 million coins at a price of 0.00025 ETH per token. The public sale will be held from the 3rd to the 31st of December of the current year.\n\nHardcap project - 40 thousand ETH.\n\n \n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe idea of creating a social network that allows you to fully control the privacy of data, filter the news feed, create joint stories, and earn on advertising, can attract many users and advertisers. Especially attractive is the idea of using Blockchain in the social network Corld, as this technology allows to ensure the integrity of the distribution of funds.\n\nCorld will be essentially an improved analogue of the famous network Instagram, attracting billions of users, despite its shortcomings. Given the features and benefits of Corld, Its audience will be able to exceed the performance of all existing social networks today.\n\nInvesting in the project, based on all its features, can be very successful for investors.\n\n \n\n### Official resources of the project Corld Cedium:\n\n**WEBSITE:** [https://cedium.io](https://cedium.io/)  \n**WEBSITE:** [https://corld.com](https://corld.com/)  \n**WHITEPAPER:** [https://cedium.io/docs/Corld-IntroductionAndStrategyBook.pdf](https://cedium.io/docs/Corld-IntroductionAndStrategyBook.pdf)\n\nBounty0x ID: ecamli",

Users should not worry about finding or trusting unproven crypto exchanges, which are mostly web-based and insecure. They should simply be able to install the Javvy application and immediately begin buying, selling, managing, and using all major cryptocurrencies within a single, safe, and secure application. The early adopters will be crypto-savvy users, likely already using competing exchanges and wallets. Eventually, they will expand into mainstream markets, due to the ease-of-use of solution that other exchanges and wallets have failed to provide \u2013despite hundreds of millions invested and many years to do so.

It seeks to reach the masses at the grass roots level in a simple format that they can understand, with little or no technical knowledge. Oracol Xor comes with an all-inclusive infrastructure that is capable of global reach and geared towards encouraging mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. The Oracol Xor ICO ends soon and the following are its goals:\n\n* Promoting mass adoption\n* Creating a worldwide distribution network\n* Launching Oracol Xor social network\n* Facilitating mobile payments using Oracol Xor\n\n \n\n### Oracol Xor Cryptocurrency Platform Benefits\n\n#### Strong Community:\n\n*Oracol Xor* is an open-source avenue that gives users the possibility to interact on a social and financial level within a secure, protected, and strong community of investors and like-minded individuals.\n\n#### Financial Freedom:\n\nThe platform enables you to improve you financial status. As a user, you can add to your portfolio Oracol Xor funds issued during private sale and ICO. You can reap the benefits by investing early in a fast developing company.\n\n#### Decentralized:\n\nThe Oracol Xor platform uses Proof of Work (PoW) protocol. All transactions are executed between users directly and not through a centralized organization. In the end, you say goodbye to intermediaries and exorbitant transaction fees.\n\n#### Earnings:\n\nYou have the opportunity to connect with the community and discover like-minded people. You can read about the platform development and progress, make new friends, and discuss tutorials to help others catch up.\n\n### Three Areas Of Development\n\n#### To Facilitate Mass Adoption\n\nOne of the prime objectives of Oracol Xor is to facilitate mass adoption. The platform seeks to achieve this through the issuance of Oracol Xor denominated cards that are available in local currencies at local stores worldwide. The company intends to use a distribution method similar to phone cards.\n\n#### To Connect Areas With Low Or No Data Coverage\n\nThe world still has three billion people with phones but no data connection, especially in the developing world, partly due to lack of adequate infrastructure. Under this circumstance, people use their phone credits to pay. For example, mobile phone solutions using 2G or 3G networks such as Mpesa in Kenya are already a success. There is a great opportunity within this population and Oracol Xor seeks to enter the market as a disruptive technology that will change the existing landscape of the industry.\n\n#### To Create A Social Network\n\nNo successful platform can thrive today without a strong social network presence. Typical examples include Facebook and YouTube, which have a huge number of subscribers. The daily use of social media platforms is increasing yet not a single platform has dedicated its operations to blockchain and cryptocurrency. Oracol Xor aim is to roll out a social media component as part of the platform and incorporate crypto currency usage as a form of payment for online purchase within the app.",

Every 34 months, FAP will be audited in order to maintain the number of users that will be increasing. Since the total supply is very low and in order to stabilize the IZA price from pump and dump by the users, Fixed Audited Price (FAP) plays the major role in price stabilization. The premium claimant is based on the FAP price that is fixed. FAP allows the cla imant leverage scalable and increases the asset value of their premium. Since Inzura is for the crypto users, every actions and protocol implemented is for the benefit of crypto users who uses Inzura. For example: Laura bought 10,000 IZA in ICO and plan s to spend 5000 IZA for Inzura premium for asset protection and plans to trade the rest 5000 IZA in an exchange. In this case, Laura can sell 5000 IZA in an exchange for $1. If there is high demand for premium purchase, users may buy the token for $5. S ince Fixed Audited Price (FAP) is fixed to $1 and the claimant is leveraged up to 5 times, the maximum price IZA can reach is $5 and there will be no use to purchase IZA token more than $5 until and unless the Fixed Audited Price (FAP) is audited and incre ased. Thus the value of the IZA token can be stabilized through FAP protocol.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vep76r0mrin21.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=f98bcddacc1ac478fae5396fe040fa082d2fc498\n\nThe Inzura token is used to claim lost/hacked cryptocurrency, where members can claim up to 5 times the value of their Inzura token (calculation with FAP) with their purchased premium, hence making the Inzura token worth 5 times more at the time of claimant. For instance: Steve purchased a premium for 1000 IZA token with a premium set for certain period of time. In the meantime, his asset in the registered exchange with Inzura platform is hacked and permanently lost and it is officially press released by the exchange regarding the hack, in which t he premium covers the exchange that is hacked. In this case, if the lost crypto worth is $5000, Steve can submit the claim worth of $5000 with premium purchased of 1000 IZA token. The price of the IZA token is calculated with FAP. The Fixed Audited P rice (FAP) of IZA will be $1 and the claim leverage will be 5 times the Fixed Audited Price value at the time of claimant.\n\n [https://www.inzura.world/#/home](https://www.inzura.world/#/home) \n\nBounty0x Username; sakaleyn",

By building a comprehensive, secure, and intuitive crypto wallet with buy, sell,  \nconvert, and management capabilities, Javvy is powered by a team with decades of extensive regulatory, compliance, programming, and security experience.\n\nJavvy proposes its crypto solution for users to overcome all barriers to adoption with a regulation-first approach, defining a carefully crafted business infrastructure and multi-tiered risk mitigation policy. The technology framework is then built on that solid foundation. The consumer-facing front-end of the Javvy solution couples, by exclusive integration, a crypto wallet with the world\u2019s first distributed, fully automated, cross-currency exchange. The combination of a properly designed crypto exchange with a safe, intuitive, and feature-rich crypto wallet, and a capable team is what sets the Javvy crypto solution apart.\n\nThe Javvy solution is not web-based, avoiding the inherent risks of traditional web-based financial services. Additionally, Javvy's technology is designed to isolate core components, according to regulatory type and AML policy restrictions. By taking this regulatory-centric approach, Javvy is able to provide anyone in the world, who has Internet connectivity and is not barred from cryptocurrency by their country's policy, full access to the  \ncryptocurrency markets. Specifically, the Javvy architecture separates key functions that do not require  \nregistration from those that do. As a result of Javvy's regulatory-centric approach, users do not need to register or have address and identity verified for send, receive, manage, or convert operations. If a user desires to purchase or sell cryptocurrency,they will then be asked to register and provide the minimal ID verification documents, as per their country of citizenship. The mobile apps will provide easy methods to upload pictures of documents and desktop apps will allow for easy upload of scanned documents, all sent to secure Javvy servers for rapid verification.",

It\u2019s no longer an internet coin with 0 real life application, you can now actually use to trade and buy the things you desire. Especially since there are now new projects like Exeno promoting this idea and linking crypto to e-commerce. \n\nIt really feels like a big step in the right direction, and the impact this has could be groundbreaking.

Yet whether we like it or not, the KYC/AML nightmare is coming to crypto.\n\nPlaces that are decentralized will be a powerful tool for this, and will stop these criminals where they stand, and this is already so with numerous exchanges. Many places like Werewolf, offer solutions for this, all through a DAO organization that will care not for profit, but for the best experience it can provide to the users. \n\nThe world is changing fast, and if modern economists can\u2019t keep up, it will pass them. \n\nIf you live in a small or poor country, you might find it impossible to jump through the arbitrary hoops designed by a San Francisco product manager on the advice of a London lawyer. The author has personally been locked out of accounts because a small EU government issued document was not accepted as valid proof of address. The company\u2019s KYC service couldn\u2019t comprehend that there are places where people do not use utility bills to prove residence.\n\nAML departments in financial service companies are more about complying with AML legislation than actually stopping money laundering.

Traders will not be able to set off losses from other crypto transactions. \n\nCrypto gifts within a family would be exempt, but gifts above Rs. 50,000 ($660) outside the family would be taxable once in the hands of recipients.\n\nThe most controversial provision \u2013 the 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) liability \u2013 won\u2019t take effect until July 1. One question I have to ask is if the crypto law also covers crypto social welfare platforms like Social Good.\n\nTDS is a liability enforced against the exchanges that deposit tax on behalf of sellers on the platform. It will be calculated at 1% of transaction value.\n\n The seller would be able to set off this 1% TDS from their total tax liability of 30%. The TDS mechanism is used to trace transactions and prevent tax evasion, according to the government.",

This is the question that spurred me to put on my Sherlock Holmes hat and do some investigation. My investigations revealed that not is this possible but it is already in play. Crypto platforms have come up with algorithms and applications that make vetting crypto projects for legitimacy and viability not only possible but also simple and starightforward , thereby ensuring that investors can ascertain their true nature before investing. A good mention here is the RiseUp platform where the RiseUp V2 token is the core of its operations and capability. \n\nThis discovery means a lot to me and many other crypto investors out there and is indeed a welcomed development.",

With decent and sustainable yields I can make this journey less stressful until the market recovers. I'm focused on staking stablecoins, mostly USDC on [YieldApp](https://www.yield.app/) because I can get 18% APY if I try a bit more. [Celsius](https://celsius.network/) can be another way to \"unbank\" yourself even if their returns are a bit lower. We should not be greedy, that is my point of view.",

Nobody will continue to work on ineffective projects, and the only ones who profit from this situation will be whales. Instead of meme coins, consider projects like Solana, Polkadot, and Bob Eco Coin.\n\nI believe it is still too soon to draw any conclusions about these projects, but they do have a lot of potential in a variety of fields.

To them it\u2019s like roulette, when you make it you have no idea why and neither do they when they fail at it. That\u2019s because they chase hype, pumps and tops, instead of projects, ideas and prospects. \n\nBe different. Yes, I know how clich\u00e9 that sounds. It\u2019s only redundant because it\u2019s true. Do not chase top and peaks go after new ideas and projects. Ideas that revolutionize the market and make differences, ideas like the Royal Falcons Club with their one-off reward system based on rarity traits at random. Ideas with some NFT projects that secure citation and ownership. Ideas that are new and different\u2026\n\nYou are not a herd animal. So stop acting like one and think for yourself for a change.\"",

I've long suspected that once utility cryptos become widely adopted, they'll be absorbed, for lack of a better term, by relevant government bodies and industries, and will serve as the foundation and lifeblood of the sectors that rely on them.\n\n Take XRP, for example. Once it begins to replace SWIFT or handle the derivatives market, I expect to rarely, if ever, hear the words \"\"XRP takes over\"\" in the media. Other popular utility cryptos will face the same fate... XLM, Algo, Hbar, VeChain, Bob Eco Coin, and other cryptocurrencies\nNow, this project may have a very different value because it assists people in finding work in the African region, where there is almost no competition. \n\nThis is a relatively new project on the block that is creating thousands of jobs and declaring war on pollution through the world of Security Tokens, despite having very different functions.\n\n It's also the first time in the world that a for-profit social enterprise has been tokenized.

WHY? This means the more Full Send tokens you hold the more you will receive! In theory, you are earning money just by holding. \n\n2) STABILIZER: 5% of each transaction automatically adds it to the liquidity pool. WHY? The liquidity pool will continuously increase, which leads to a higher price floor of Full Send. 5% liquidity helps stabilize the price. Therefore, if a big holder wanted to sell, it would not affect price as much as if there was no liquidity there. \n\n3) BURNS: 1% of each transaction travels to Asgard, a black hole - and are permanently removed from our circulation. Asgard is an inaccessible wallet that no one can enter. WHY? With fewer outstanding shares, the ratio of net income to shares becomes higher.\n\n4) POSSIBILITY OF ADJUSTING TOKENOMICS: we hope in the future, with a collaboration with NelkBoys, we can provide Practical Utility by adjusting the Tokenomics of FullSendCrypto, to incorporate a redistribution fee towards a NelkBoys Foundation Charity Wallet. With this presented to them, with substantial funds, we believe a real partnership would be possible, and allow us to help their brand, and help our community and investors alike!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [www.fullsendcrypto.net](https://www.fullsendcrypto.net)",

Being focused on alternative investments (inaccessible or illiquid assets), the platform will represent assets via cryptographic tokens. The platform will consist of multiple components many of which will be open source:  \n\u2013 App marketplace. Third-party developers will be able to build apps on the platform.  \n\u2013 Task marketplace. Any user will be rewarded for research, coding, analytics and other activity positively reviewed by community.  \n\u2013 ICO platform with the tokenization engine. This feature will help other projects to go through ICO smoothly.  \n\u2013 Governance and voting engine. The platform will be governed by the community through the decision voting system.  \nOther components include such features as rewards programs for stakeholders, smart-contract-based decentralized auctioning marketplace, licensed exchange following all regulations, multi-factor authentication, secure crypto asset storage, and investors\u2019 portfolios management.  \nTheir token called VALOR will be used to reward contributors (task marketplace), allow users to vote, for granting special rights on the platform, and as collateral to eliminate misconduct. A total supply is 100 million tokens. The distribution is as follows: 45% \u2013 sale, 26% \u2013 reserve for development, 19% \u2013 founders, team, and advisors, 5% \u2013 liquidity buffer, 5% \u2013 bounty and network growth.\n\n## Team\n\nThe team consists of 15 specialists in blockchain technology, cryptography, banking, software development, and the implementation of large scale IT projects. The project founder and CEO Olga Feldmeier, a prominent figure in Switzerland blockchain community, an entrepreneur focusing on banking and blockchain technology, has serious experience on management positions in different companies in Switzerland, England, and Germany. They also have 6 advisors from different spheres, top managers, and entrepreneurs.\n\n## Summary\n\nAlternative investments is a huge market, and Smart Valor is going to step inside with the simple idea of tokenization of illiquid assets and make the trading process easy and transparent. And this should work. Smart Valor is presenting the VALOR platform as blockchain agnostic and planning to make it completely official, in compliance with regulators.\n\n[https://smartvalor.com/](https://smartvalor.com/) ",

            "text": "\nMogul Productions, the decentralized film financing (DeFiFi) platform that gives everyone a voice in the creative process, launches its platform. Starting today, users can create an account to have the chance to be whitelisted for future access to STARS tokens and check-out the films in the Showcase that will be voted on with STARS when the platform is released on mainnet.\n\nGagan Grewal, CEO of Mogul Productions, expressed, \"With all the major streaming platforms experiencing global viewership spikes in 2020 and predictions of the current $50.11 billion market growing 21.0% each year, it's clear that there is a nearly insatiable demand for great content, and yet, it's incredibly difficult for independent creators to get their stories financed and made into films. The exploding demand vs. insufficient supply is one of the most unbalanced markets across industries. At Mogul, we are giving filmmakers, fans, and film financiers a voice in the creative process, ensuring that more great films get made, and helping to right this asymmetrical market.\"\n\nIn the current entertainment ecosystem, indie filmmakers have a hard time getting their ideas financed, fans have no say in the process, and financiers have very little transparency into what is happening with their investment. Mogul Productions will deploy blockchain technology to address these myriad issues, creating an entertainment ecosystem that works for everyone.\n\nIn the Mogul platform, creators gain opportunities for collaboration and the chance to get their films financed by the Mogul community. If their project is greenlit, creators also receive production oversight from the experienced Mogul team and a built-in fanbase to support the film's success upon distribution.\nMovie fans will be able to engage with the filmmakers and their favorite projects in deeper, more meaningful ways: from voting for which films will receive funding, to earning STARS that are redeemable for prizes like one-of-a-kind film posters, red carpet tickets, and invitations to exclusive events.\n\nMogul also plans to release a digital asset that will enable compliant participation in profit sharing from Mogul-produced movies. Financiers will also benefit from greater transparency into how film funds are being deployed during production as well as how profits are being distributed after release. Mogul's team of experienced producers provide oversight to ensure productions stay in-budget and on-schedule.\n\nUpon mainnet launch, users will be eligible to receive STARS, the platform's in-app currency used to vote on which films receive funding. Mogul harnesses the power of the crowd in its decentralized quadratic voting system, which ensures users with more tokens do not have undue influence over the process. \n\nAll votes are counted using a formula that makes each vote cast by the same user exponentially more expensive, preventing vote buying and restricting wealth dominance.\n\nMogul's non-custodial Smart Wallet, which will be live upon mainnet launch, is designed to make it easy for anyone, regardless of crypto knowledge, to hold and use STARS. The automated password reset flow gives users the ability to reset their passwords in a way that is familiar based on other web experiences without ever giving Mogul access to their private keys.\n\nThe Mogul Continuous Organization is another unique invention of the Mogul team. By deploying Mogul Continuous Organization Technology, it automatically delegates cash flow management to a community governed organization to ensure constant liquidity for financiers.\n\nIntially 1.1 million starts will be allocated to farmers per day. Mogul is focusing on a very unique usecase and is definitely one to watchout for imo.\n\nMogul will launch on uniswap on April 22nd\n\nTwitter:- https://twitter.com/we_are_mogul\n\nTelegram:- https://t.me/mogulproductions\n\nReddit:- https://www.reddit.com/r/mogulproductions\n\nWebsite:- https://www.mogulproductions.com/",

            "text": "***Disclaimer and TLDR - Do not invest more than you can afford! If you want to see pure numbers look to the bottom of the post!***\n\n**First of all, a little intro and resoning behind why I did this.** I've seen a few people on here previously, posting about investing into the top market cap coins and hodling for a year-ish with some success. I liked the idea and wanted to give this a shot. Most of the top coins (I used [Gate.io](https://Gate.io)) seemed like solid choices but I skipped a few like DOGE because I am hoping to keep hodling for a few months at least and I didn't see these coins as good long(er) term investments.\n\nBut what about the rest of the coins I follow, the ones I've dipped in and out of previously with success and thought might have some returns over the course of a few months? Well I had my list of Top 10 market cap coins, why not make a list of Top 10 personal choices and vie them up against each other, see If I can beat the gains of the big boys of the market! So I did!\n\nBefore we move onto the numbers I want to point out that while I'm 'investing' $2000 at no point did I go over the limit of what I could afford to lose and anyone new to the crypto markets who is reading this shouldn't see my post as some sort of game to play with their money. I am also not an experienced trader, I got into crypto in February when the first DOGE spikes of the year were happening around $0.02 - $0.05. I made a few dollars and was hooked into looking at graphs for days on end. I got into day trading and made some decent profit here and lost some there. I wanted to try out hodling and so here we are!\n\n.\n\nNow the bit you all wanted to see, the first months numbers! I invested $100 into each of the 20 coins listed below from best to worst performers. (Percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number)\n\n**Top 10 market cap coins - initial investment $100 each on 13 April**\n\n* **ETH** $192 (+92%)\n* **LTC** $149 (+49%)\n* **LINK** $148 (+48%)\n* **ADA** $135 (+35%)\n* **BNB** $124 (+24%)\n* **XLM** $124 (+24%)\n* **UNI** $110 (+10%)\n* **XRP** $101 (+1%)\n* **DOT** $95 (-5%)\n* **BTC** $94 (-6%)\n\nMonth-on-Month change **+$272 (+27%)**\n\n.\n\n**Top 10 personal choices -  initial investment $100 each on 13 April**\n\n* **GT** $255 (+155%)\n* **HT** $167 (+67%)\n* **ALGO** $101 (+1%)\n* **TRX** $100 (No change)\n* **THETA** $99 (-1%)\n* **BAT** $97 (-3%)\n* **AVA** $86 (-14%)\n* **ONE** $86 (-14%)\n* **HBAR** $82 (-18%)\n* **CRO** $81 (-19%)\n\nMonth-on-Month change **+$154 (+15%)**\n\n.\n\nAs you can see from the first months numbers the 'Top 10 market cap' list won the month and the only reason I made any profit in the 'Top 10 personal choices' list was down to two coins **GT** and **HT**. I specifically chose those because **BNB** had seen such a rise in recent weeks, IMO it was only a matter of time before the other exchange tokens started to make a move.\n\nAnyway, interesting results for the first month, hopfully I wont have lost everything by next month and will be able to bring you all another update! Until then... HODL! :D",

But the experiences I've been having are really quite not too encouraging. \n\nSometimes, it'd be a tug of war while trying to get whitelisted, and sometimes, luckily, you'd get whitelisted, but yet have no guaranteed allocation. Equity and fairness to all investors, whether big (whales) or small,  seem quite a notable key thing that is now missing when IDOs are held. These have been some of my concerns about IDOs on launchpads, but not limited to this alone.\n\nPolkastater has been one of the most used launchpads for IDOs for quite a while now, with the likes of Launchpool, Cardstater, Paid Ignition and many others.\n\nAs much as these are very different launchpads, however, they all seem to be quite similar in their modus operandi. Such that, they all have more than one investment tier, KYC, do use lottery and other means as a tool for distribution of allocations for all whitelisted and are not interoperable. \n\nPerhaps this has been some of the key reasons why the experiences I've been having alongside some other folks out there; has been simply because there is not too much difference in approaches employed or used by some of these already existing and working launchpads.\n\nWhile trying to consider looking into IDOs on another entirely different launchpad, I stumbled on Gpool which seems to be having quite a completely different approach to conducting IDOs from the existing norms we already have.\n\nGpool will be a cross-chain, interoperable platform that can find and launch projects from any part of the cryptosphere which will allow investors to buy into their launchpad for a reasonable initial investment and without KYC as other launchpads do *(a truly decentralized manner)*.\n\nOver time, statistics have shown that, while these IDOs are done, they quite often lack equity and fairness, particularly to the small investors as they usually give 1% of the minted tokens to their community *(we will exceed this)*. In other words, there usually seems to be some level of favouritism for the big investors neglecting the fact that the small investors also got whitelisted. To simply put, there exist no guaranteed allocations for all whitelisted, and by implication means there exist no whale resistance. \n\nAll of these irregularities are what Gpool intends to abolish, such that there will be guaranteed allocations for whitelisting participants, being whale-resistant, having just one investment tier, loyalty program, voting right for every investor, will be cross-chain (interoperable), will engage projects in negotiation much earlier to ensure more tokens for the community.\n\nAll these ideas from Gpool look quite very good on paper. However, it is not always really about how good what they intend to offer may appear to be, but all about executing it and making it become a reality. \n\nWill Gpool truly change the narratives for launchpads in the crypto space, or will the norms continue as it's always been?\n\nThis question I cannot answer until the project is finally launched. Keeping my fingers crossed.\n\n[Website](https://gpool.app/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/gpoolofficial) \n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/gpoolofficial)",

            "text": " So why do we see all this as important? Adam Amos, Pigzbe Founder and Chief Operating Officer, argues that public perception of trust and the desire to protect an ICO\u2019s community is of the utmost importance. \u201cIf we want to be successful, we have to provide our community with the ability to trust us and provide security to anyone participating in our ICO or connected to our product, service or brand. It\u2019s just the right thing to do.\u201d \n\n&#x200B;\n\n \u201cAt Pigzbe we\u2019re looking to bring as much transparency and openness to our process as we can. Unfortunately general market perception over the past few years is that ICOs are run by people or companies that are not associated with any rules\u200a\u2014\u200athe Wild West if you like. They weren\u2019t fulfilling the promises they gave either in their White Papers or in the tokens they were distributing.\u201d \n\n&#x200B;\n\n That reputation hasn\u2019t been helped by the fickleness exhibited in different regions, such as China closing down anything to do with crypto, crypto exchanges or ICOs and the US not having proper (or any) regulations in place. By classing everything as a security, this opens ICO participants up to jeopardy for breaking taxation rules. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n \u201cSo it\u2019s very meaningful for us to make sure everyone understands we are doing everything we can to protect them, build a strong community and develop something for the long term. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n \u201cUsing Switzerland and having an understanding of a regulatory framework to work against was the most secure way of defining our ICO and the utility of our token. But I think what we are also trying to do is provide an exemplar ICO which can benefit the rest of the crypto community. We\u2019re marrying the traditional processes and compliance structures of the financial services world, with cutting edge Fintech and legal practices. It\u2019s important to us that we communicate this to everyone\u200a\u2014\u200afrom consumer to government.\u201d ",

IFY is a high-potential investment that will be featured on Wall Street Bets and Satoshi Bets on February 16.\n\nIFY is a crypto that is loyal to its holders, and offers many ways to make huge returns. Through the Weak Hand Tax, market manipulation and other factors that may result in depreciation of value are deterred AND the IFY staking pool is fueled (self sufficient). Infinity Yield offers staking at up to 245% ROI, a number that will be hard for anyone to turn down. \n\nFor those interested in investing, the IFY presale begins on February 23 at 19:00 UTC, and is available through the infinity yield website. There is a limited amount of available tokens that will be sold during the presale, so it is important to get in early to ensure you get a spot.\n\nFor more information and future updates on Infinity Yield, visit our website: http://infinityyield.space/",

You must find something that people can relate to so that you can compare the two in any way, shape or form.  I use this to grab the attention of anybody such as family and friends who invest. So far, it has been really effective! \n\nI explain it exactly like you would a Best Buy store. You walk in and you see different sections with a little bit of everything. In the center-front where the cell phone services are, is where the actual PYE token would be, right behind that is the PYE wallet (headphones & gadgets section), on the right side is the PYE shop (TV section), back right is the PYE Chart (appliance section), back center would be PYE mining (tablets & computers section), back left is the NFT marketplace (camera section), middle left is the charity aspect of PYE (because that\u2019s the video game section and everyone loves charity and video games) and the very front left (Geek Squad section) is the nation of PYE.\n\nThat last comparison is very important because this is a nation like no other and its mind blowing that this is just the beginning. I compare us to Geek Squad because they\u2019re always helpful and that\u2019s what PYE nation does. They care for you, help you out when you need it, and will stay honest with you through your whole time with them. They are truly amazing.\n\nI\u2019m not going to tell you to buy, how much to buy or even when to buy. All I can say is that I\u2019m a holder. That this is the gem of all gems. A true once in a life opportunity that will change lives. That this is a great entry point since the market will bounce back up soon. That I believe in their incredible team, tech and values they have. This was BY FAR the easiest token I could get behind and trust. The potential is unreal, and it will be met. I have and will continue to keep buying and holding all the way to the top when we eventually hit 1 trillion market cap. Now that\u2019s a hot take for you! \n\n**** Please drop a like if you support PYE and share your own comparisons down below!

We all wish for there to be mass adoption, but we often forget just how poor the majority of the world really is. One thing that\u2019s not reasonable for the majority of users is to pay the gas fees that we\u2019ve all become accustomed to paying. There\u2019s a number of platforms that are currently working on a gasless model, and it\u2019s worthwhile to explore them as this very well could be the breakthrough crypto needs to make our community truly accessible to the masses.\r\n\r\nPolkaDot $DOT/Kasuma $KSM\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s more like buying real estate than buying a token at this point. Parachains will be auctioned off to the highest bidders. The benefit of this will be two-fold. The fact that these will be gasless environments will certainly attract users of all kinds, both rich and poor. The additional engagement will lead to higher engagement and benefit the projects significantly, as well as their tokens.\r\n\r\nCurate $XCUR\r\n\r\nCurate is building a shopping/marketplace/NFT app and they just announced that they\u2019re building their own gasless chain called The X-Chain XCUR (XC-20). This means that when their app is released that we\u2019ll be able to have access to buy anything in XCUR\u2019s ecosystem with no additional gas fees. They already partnered up with Shopping.io and Travala. Being able to shop for NFTs, anything on major platforms that they\u2019re connected to and do P2P trades as well.\r\n\r\nFTX.Com $FTT\r\n\r\nWhen you stake 150 FTT, all withdrawals on FTX.com are covered by the platform. The savings add up very quickly for anyone that\u2019s doing a lot of trading via open wallets. You\u2019re paying a ton of gas fees as you move your tokens from your primary wallet to MetaMask to use with Uni. At least FTX cuts into that while also providing solid hourly APYs for a ton of tokens. After buying Miami\u2019s Heat stadium naming rights away from American Airlines I\u2019m also not worried about them disappearing out of the blue.\r\n\r\nWhat other projects are you seeing that are gasless?",

There are plenty of existing and aspiring blockchain gaming companies, and hundreds if not thousands of upcoming projects \u2013 it can be easy to lose track of who\u2019s who and what\u2019s what. What are your thoughts on this niche?\nHere are some of the best Blockchain Gaming Studios that are worth giving a shot:\n\u00b7       DAPPER LABS\nThis dev studio is closely related to the launch of the overall blockchain gaming trend \u2013 back in 2017, they released CryptoKitties, famously the first successful Play2Earn title featuring NFTs and crypto-related gameplay. While the game itself has died down in popularity, Dapper Labs has continued to create more content, including Cheeze Wizards.\n \n\u00b7       VULCAN FORGED\nVulcan Forged is not only a blockchain game studio but also an NFT marketplace. They are the makers of VulcanVerse. PYR is the native utility token that is used for: Fees for marketplace settlement. The studio offers smooth operation and is great for beginners as well.\n \n\u00b7       DECENTRALAND\nDecentraland is behind the synonymous online gaming platform \u2013 announced in 2017, it hosts a plethora of unique projects. Users can buy, sell, trade, and use virtual land in the form of crypto tokens, and then decorate and present that land however they want. People have used it for online stores, art galleries, and virtual hangout spots.\n \n\u00b7        SKY MAVIS\nSky Mavis, the company behind Axie Infinity is perhaps the most important blockchain gaming company in the space right now. Not only was it one of the first successful ones, but it has also so far withstood the test of time, and has seen huge numbers of players consistently for quite some time.\nHave you used and blockchain-based gaming studios before and how was your experience of the same?",

And some of them have come from unexpected places. \n\nThis is the \"\"perfect storm moment,\"\" according to Zuckerberg, to create a sort of 3D / VR version of Facebook, based on decades-old software and interface concepts, but with modern low-cost interface technology and high-speed networks capable of supporting this type of mass interactive internet traffic.\n\nSome metaverses, such as alienworlds, may simply be locations where people go to get their fix and have a good time.\n\n Some people may choose a calm second existence in the metaverse than being a part of this insanity. Metakawn, a Modern Muslim generation-focused initiative, and nfts have a similar community. \n\nThis is the first Metaverse for Modern Muslims who share common ideals in a Halal EcoSystem.\n\nIn actuality, multiple \"\"metaverses\"\" can exist, and the titles of distinct metaverses, such as internet environments, are meaningless.",

In short, most of the existing crypto wallets force users to register with affiliated, third-party vendors, requiring them to provide a plethora of personal and confidential documents.\n\nBoth, existing crypto wallets and exchanges are predominantly based in the United States and are severely limited by regulatory restrictions. None of them are able to easily pivot to move outside of the United States, to overcome these limitations, because the terms and conditions of the US-based startup incubators and fundraising platforms all require them to form as and remain US-based companies. Breaking those agreements will be next to impossible, leaving forward-thinking companies, such as Javvy, that are registered outside of the United States, with a significant competitive advantage.  \n\n\n[https://javvy.com/](https://javvy.com/)",

Our love for crypto currency brings our founding members together, but we know that the crypto currency can be the basis for something much larger and lucrative. The Blockchain companies at the operational level are no different from traditional companies. They require a good organization, consultancy, marketing, proper due diligence and legal support. Through our partnership network and collaboration, we offer a comprehensive solution to the level of trust and loyalty to blockchain companies. When you enter the uncertain world of the world, the fact that Kolektif is with you provides a comfortable feeling to focus on building your basic product.We create, design, and develop community building strategies for coherent, reliable beginnings in the crypto currency field and provide a safe place for both initial and community interaction. From this unique perspective, we believe that we are in an excellent position to protect participants and beginners from deceptions and ineffective propositions. With this foundation in Blockchain we look at the future with the essence of society management. However, there are a few markets we can take to penetrate our society. This is the Collective Global Initiative. The collective believes in cooperation between similar thinkers. Most of the time, we see companies talking to each other and competing in the arena where a simple partnership is more appropriate to them. Everybody's trying to beat the other guy to be the first in the market.As the healthy competition increased its success, The Collective saw the power of first-hand cooperation and the great potential that lies within a suitable polarized enterprise. In this context, we believe that we can connect companies to build an alliance under our Global Initiative values. \n\nThese alliances will cooperate in all areas of the block chain, including compliance with regulations, anti-fraud policing and general best practices. As a neutral agent, we are in a perfect position to enforce this initiative. The Collective Global Initiative also has the opportunity to make the best of our work as organizers, coaches and marketers in the emerging concert community through well-placed strategic partners. There is a world full of people who are about to start work and never before. These communities will need sales points for training, idea incubation and guidance.The collective can be a guiding light for people entering the field for the first time, through partnerships, change, new initiatives and cooperation. We aim to create a place where everyone in the Collective Global Initiative can interact in a safe and reliable environment. The collective is here.

            "text": "In the last 5 years, more than $1 billion of crypto investors\u2019 money have been lost to ICO scams. In some other cases, ICO projects launched with good intentions, but weak business cases, inexperienced teams, and unrealistic targets have also lost investors their money. Identifying ICO scams takes a bit of research and a little common sense surprisingly. Here are some things to look out for. \n\n\u2022 Website quality \nBlockchain projects are essentially software projects. If a development team can\u2019t create a quality website, then how likely are they to create decent crypto.  \n\n\u2022 Spelling and grammar on the website \nA website riddled with spelling and grammatical errors is a red flag. Yes, many ICO projects are run by teams who don\u2019t live in English-speaking countries and so a couple of grammatical errors can be expected, however, it shouldn\u2019t be plagued with grammatical errors.  \n\n\u2022 Use of Original images \nLegitimate ICO projects will create their own images for the things that matter like app interfaces and business model illustrations. Google\u2019s reverse image search can help you determine if the image has been used elsewhere. \n\n\u2022 Research the team \nYou\u2019ll probably not get to meet the team in person unless you are a whale investor. However, you should do your research on the members of the team, their history, capabilities, and experience. \n\n\u2022 Study the business plan \nThe business case should be clear and actionable. Any ambiguity should be adequately expelled to ensure feasibility. \n\n\u2022 Escrow or no deal \nICOs with good intentions can fail to reach their minimum funding target. The question is, what happens when the project fails? You should only subscribe to ICOs that have an Escrow arrangement. This implies that funds are only released to the ICO team upon the fulfillment of agreed milestones. ICO funds are staked and investors can make an added profit on their donations. \n\n\u2022 Vet ICOs \nIn recent times, we have seen the establishment of platforms with the ability to help investors with all the aforementioned due diligence procedures leveraging on technology.\n\n Carrying out these investigations by self can be a bit daunting. So to make things easier, investors can leverage these platforms. An example of such a platform is the RiseUp platform.",

Gemstra is already paying out commissions to thousands of social sellers and the numbers are growing monthly. The foundation will have live utility on October 1 and bonus sellers taking commissions in crypto and discounting all orders placed with crypto. They are going to focus on seller growth and reach $100 Million in annualized sales volume by the end of 2019. Approximately 30-40% that means $300-$400 of volume will be paid out as commission to sellers. Given their incentive model to welcome sellers to crypto use, they expect 35% election of receiving a commission in Gemstra Token (GMS).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe vision of Gemstra Foundation is about helping people achieve their dreams. Social selling can be the great equalizer. You don\u2019t need a fancy education, a powerful title, a specific style or look. You will succeed in social selling as long as you\u2019re passionate and willing to work hard. Social selling is about decentralizing consumer profits and putting dollars into the hands of people and their households - breaking power blocs and giving people the ability to live and earn independently on their own terms. Satoshi\u2019s vision for a decentralized currency draws from a similar vein of belief - that there\u2019s something wrong in the world where too much power is controlled by too few people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to see crypto validated through a working business that has a social impact by yielding the profit to hundreds of millions of people, then join with the Gemstra Foundation and change the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo find more details, please check [website](https://gemstra.com/) and [whitepaper](https://docsend.com/view/xvyqq7a).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBounty0x username: hashin",

White lists in the kabn are designed to support binary yes / no queries to allow or prevent restricted transactions such as buying crypto tokens. White lists on the KABN network have customizable compatibility rules. Customers participating in the White list and fulfilling all compliance rules are permitted to perform restricted transactions. When a customer joins a white list, the customer is asked to fill out the information and upload copies of personal documents. \n\nThe kabn is capable of creating different web forms to match different white list rules. KABN maintains the history in the White list to avoid requesting the same information from the same customer more than once. KABN white list architecture provides compatibility and scaling at multiple financial contact points while meeting the needs of individual customers.\n\n#  Always-On Compliance \n\nKABN supports internationally recognized documents for the recognition of your customer (KYC) regulations. In addition, for issuers of private or early assets, KABN  provides investors in the United States and Canada with qualification and asset verification resources for investors in Europe. \n\nSo far KABN has scanned individuals in the following countries: Armenia, Australia, Bangladesh, Belarus, Canada, Ecuador, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Latvia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Philippines, Romania, Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkey , Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America and Vietnam. Other countries will be added when they enter the ship. \n\nCustomers on the KABN network receive ongoing anti-money laundering (AML) tracking requests to confirm or update personal information that has expired or is outdated. Financial technology initiatives may use this operational burden as an external resource at no extra cost.\n\nTo provide compatibility solutions, some information and documents are sensitive to personally identifiable information (PII) that the Kabn stores in the encrypted database and Object Repository in Ireland to be compatible with GDPR. Beginners and publishers, according to the management's observation, are often inadequate to handle sensitive data. In most cases, employees in less experienced companies store their customer documents on personal computer devices. By providing customer-oriented applications, kabn protects all customers from processing sensitive data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[KABN](https://preview.redd.it/jcmw5kg1d7x21.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=0370f94e27d5c36047e87c937f87e8a03c911412)\n\n[KABN Website](https://www.kabntoken.com)\n\n[Whitepaper](https://www.kabntoken.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/KABN-Company-Overview-Summary-V1.2.pdf)\n\nBounty0x username: demirci",

            "text": "There is no perfect technology in the world today and therefore there is no chance to create a decentralized exchange that works smoothly and carries out a large number of instant transactions per second. Centralized stock exchanges ensure greater liquidity and greater trading volume. 99% of transactions with crypto cells are handled on the central stock exchange. With the help of the central stock exchange, only cryptogram transactions are available, the latter allowing currency exchange in crypto roles and vice versa. Decentralized exchanges only allow payments in cryptoLooks, and those that centrally ensure the use of conventional payments.\n\nThe Central Exchange works very similar to traditional exchanges. Users cannot access their private keys and transactions are controlled by the owner. Therefore, users must be sure that they can trust the company that operates the exchange. Transactions can only be done through a mechanism provided and approved by the head office. They provide fast transactions and support multiple users simultaneously. The exchanges that are distributed are not supported by any company and use locking technology. The exchange only offers trading opportunities without personal information stored for consumers.\n\n**CoinCasso security measures**\n\nCoinCasso platform provides a fast and safe solution for exchanging FIAT and trading crypto data and currencies. They have provided many security features that help you use the site safely. At the same time, they have maintained standards for fast and easy service. However, CoinCasso must adhere to the standards and requirements of the places where they serve their customers. Due to regulations, some restrictions apply to regions or countries, and services may not be available there. Information about KYC, AML rules can be found on CoinCasso partners page.\n\nCoinCasso also considers the possibility of introducing a review of the Trulioo and Jumio documents. After that, customers can create a special account after an audit or transfer to our FIAT account. Deposits in cash are automatically approved by the system, and FIAT deposits depend on the service or bank where the customer provides an account. From time to time, the security department can request further review if there are suspected malfunctions or only standard elections - all for the safety of 95% of user funds protected in the Cold CoinCasso OU Cold portfolio with added security. This leads to higher protection against leg theft.\n\n**HOW TO REGISTER ON COINCASSO EXCHANGE**\n\n The registration itself requires an email address, password, and cellphone number to verify the process. Every customer must undergo an identification process that allows him to raise the age limit and ensure the safety and procedures needed. Our support works 24 hours a day and constantly reviews all related issues.\n\n\nWebsite: https://coincasso.io/\n\nhttps://coincasso.io/ENGLISH_CoinCasso_official_PLV1.pdf?v1.1\n\nBountyox username: wandiiee",

Simply put, an IEO is an ICO but uses an active exchange as an intermediary to the token sale. Huobi, Okex, Binance and Bittrex are amongst a growing number of exchanges already offering IEO\u2019s with more likely to follow over the next few months. Recent high profile IEO\u2019s have increased public interest and attracted more projects to the fundraising mechanism. BitTorrent recently raised $7.2 million in 18 minutes, and Fetch.AI recently raised $6 million in 22 seconds through Binance. Just this week, ICO Bench reported a record sale for the\u00a0MultiVAC IEO, which reportedly sold $3.44M in 7 seconds.\n\nThe exact reasons for the astronomic sales have yet to be clarified but the enhanced exposure through the exchanges is likely to be a key factor. It is also unclear if we are witnessing a terminal decline to ICO\u2019s or just an evolutionary phase that will provide a new wave of enthusiasm through the crypto community.\n\nChange is upon us and in response to the evolving climate, THE COLLECTIVE has made a strategic decision to shortly switch its ICO over to an IEO. The exciting news comes following much consideration and after listening to members of the community who have been expressive in their views on the topic. The decision follows the motto that the Community is THE COLLECTIVE and giving power to those within the community is fundamental to the future growth and success of all involved. THE COLLECTIVE believe it is in the best interest for all parties concerned and also to the company itself. The decision which should take effect at the end of April is designed to leverage the benefits of an IEO whilst maintaining the integrity of an ICO. The illustrative benefits to the IEO decision are highlighted below.\n\n**Benefits of an\u00a0IEO**\n\nThe relationship between exchange and token creators is quite symbiotic. At first glance it would appear the benefits are clearly in favour of the company listing the token but the benefits extend far beyond this.\n\n[http://thecollectivegroup.org/](http://thecollectivegroup.org/)",

In doing so, both coin holders and investors are likely to use the ecosystem even if they have no previous exposure to participation in online gambling itself. It combines crypto and online gambling, ensuring gambling is more than just a game which is played by chance.\n\nAccording to CEO Coin-Otaku, Faireum a gaming platform attracts gaming operators, but in the present revenue model, the traditional gaming site will not obtain large returns on gaming operators in terms of fees and expenses.\n\n>\u201cTherefore, Faireum (Fairiam) will focus on attracting users. Since users place importance on the abundance of games, security, safety, etc., the number of users depends on the capabilities of the platform.  \nBy further improving the benefits for gaming operators and the benefits for users, the fee as revenue from Faireum will increase and the business will function more,\u201d says the gaming expert.\n\n\u201cSince the beta version has been completed, we are preparing to deliver it to users,\u201d says the CEO of Ishihara. \u00a0 \u00a0The asset market provides negative images with market price and provides compliance as well as regulations in the industry. The CEO has also proposed an ICO to receive funds, in recent times.\n\nIshihara concluded the interview thus, \u201cI am looking forward to the day when the blockchain game reaches the user by activating the platform.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://faireum.io/](https://faireum.io/)",

SafeInvest doesn\u2019t rely on a pump-and-dump scheme and has a unique anti-whale mechanism. It can be used as a store of value and as an interest earning asset because every holder profits from every part of an 8% transaction fee.\n\nDue to the unique fee design SafeInvest achieves to let every holder profit and not only the whales. With every transaction 4% gets burned which leads to ever growing value and constantly decreasing supply. The other 4% gets proportionally distributed to all holders. No liquidity fee is taxed because it only leads to solving the problem whales are facing, namely not being able to cash out quickly due to lack of liquidity.\n\nRug-proof due to the locked liquidity, open source, revealed faces on website and 100% community-driven\n\nAnti-whale mechanism - max. transferable amount is 0.3% of total supply and NO artificial liquidity stolen from average buyers - Let\u2019s not just pay the big holder\u2019s easy cash out, let everyone profit from the fees equally!\n\nBuy now: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x55Ee329855be1BB356230fD625fc53E4942322F8\nWebsite:\nhttps://safeinvestcrypto.com/\nTelegram:\nhttps://t.me/SafeInvestChat",

Yet, more than basically opening up crowd funding crosswise over outskirts or other crypto currency tokens, the use of PLG token in crowd funding on the Pledgecamp platform empowers the model to advance above and beyond and really release the intensity of the group.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAside from that, the ecosystem created within Pledgecamp platform has all the users engaged by either contributing or getting rewards on the platform. This will make them more engaged in activities within the platform. Those who possess *camp share* will ensure the platform is free from people who have destructive campaigns by reporting it and likewise, there is an opportunity to promote a project too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**To conclude,**\n\nPledgecamp is securing the future of crowd funding with blockchain protected investments; and Pledgecamp also allows users to back with confidence, with blockchain-powered security and token incentives for swift collaboration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [https://pledgecamp.com/](https://pledgecamp.com/)\n\nWhitepaper: [https://pledgecamp.com/whitepaper](https://pledgecamp.com/whitepaper)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBounty0x: oluwani",

In this regard, part of the coins blocked by traders will be redeemed after the blocking period.\n\nOne of the main features of the exchange that distinguish it from other crypto-currency trading platforms is the presence of a voting system that allows investors to independently determine the path of development of the exchange. If no option satisfying the investors was proposed during the voting, they can put forward their proposals and put them to a General vote. In addition, this voting system allows you to quickly and effectively solve the most pressing problems of the exchange, as well as issues related to the inclusion in the listing of a currency, which provides the most pleasant trading for all traders.\n\nhttps://catex.io",

The OPP Token is used to reward our community for sharing their data. OPP Tokens are paid to our active community members on a daily basis and making a significant financial contribution towards their monthly bills.\n\nLet\u2019s face it\u200a\u2014\u200awould you have any objection to OPP Open WiFi paying all or part of your monthly internet bills? Of course not! Our business model is what we feel will make our token desirable and valuable and sought after for many years to come.\n\nYou are able to liquidate your token holding in accordance with our \u201clock-in rules\u201d. The lock-in states that you can sell a maximum of 25% of your token holding in any 90 day period. We have done this to protect the value of the OPP token.\n\nThe target price at which the OPP token will list on crypto trading platforms is $0.40. With this projection in mind, with an investment of $50k you will buy the tokens at $0.24 offering you a potential return on the tokens of 66%. Your stake in the profit share does not depend upon you holding a token reserve.\n\nThe table above shows the projected profit from the OPP token in 2019 and the yearly profit prediction share payments for the remainder of the 5 years.\n\nhttps://www.oppopenwifi.com/",

Using the POW rating to provide a high potential mining status is to ensure that the position is at a high level when looking at cover mining. Veil using the X16R hash algorithm to build the foundation of veil mining. Raven coin introduced by this technology has been used by many people for just to take the risk. Developed the X16rt, which maximizes all the benefits of X16rt. Stock markets and mining pools will appreciate the fact that they don't have to replace software that calculates block-mixed values on the network.\n\nIn fact, I know I'm confused, but apart from mining, the veil also has the ability to stretch because of the hybrid consensus system POS. The target is the same as any other POS that lets you win based on the coins you hold in your wallet or veil coins. Veil POS application is very tempting for those who like to keep their money, who want to hide their assets. Because they use zerocoin technology for high security and Privacy.\n\nWebsite :: [https://veil-project.com/](https://veil-project.com/)\n\nBTT : [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5065331](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5065331)",

The blockchain technology-based crowdfunding platform has been advised by big names in the crypto sphere including Randi Zuckerberg, the founder, and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, Keith Teare, the founding shareholder at Techcrunch, and Matt Curcio, the VP Data at Ripple up to $3 million sales of the public token.\n\nPledgecamp is trying to bring a remarkable change in the existing crowdfunding model with the help of smart contract-user Backer Insurance escrow model. The San Francisco-based company was founded by the Kickstarter veterans from the crowdfunding field including Eddie Lee, Jae Choi, and Sam Pullman.\n\nApart from Pledgecamp, the team of Pullman, Lee, and Choi introduced many crowdfunding campaigns on the platform of Kickstarter and were successful at raising $2.2 million. Even now this performance remains one of the topmost campaigns on this platform. However, there are certain flaws in this platform. According to Choi, Pullman, and Lee, the platform is inefficient for the participants, especially for the investors who invest in a startup project.\n\nInvestors usually suffer great loss in the project plan that does not deliver as expected and there is no means left to recover the funding. These outcomes are caused due to misaligned incentives between the participants involved in the process, Forbes reported. Platforms like Pledgecamp supplement their model of crowdfunding with a decentralized and open marketplace for participants so that they can contribute skills to the startups and contribute to the development of a broader ecosystem.\n\nBlockchain banking BABB recently completed its equity crowdfunding via Crowdcube successfully. The firm raised around \u00a31,400,000 in the crowdfunding participated by 1,232 investors. According to IBS Intelligence, the firm will use this fund to support banking license applications of BABB in the Lithuania and UK.\n\nWhile discussing the project plan of BABB, the Chief Executive Officer of the banking firm Rushd Averroes said, \u201cThis funding marks another critical milestone as we move towards our goal of improving lives and livelihoods and creating new opportunities for individuals and businesses across the world.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [https://pledgecamp.com/](https://pledgecamp.com/)\n\nWhitepaper: [https://pledgecamp.com/\\_\\_pdf/whitepaper-pledgecamp-9-23.pdf](https://pledgecamp.com/__pdf/whitepaper-pledgecamp-9-23.pdf)\n\nBounty0x ID: ecamli",

However, Catex plans to make things easy by making a larger fraction of their generated commissions from users transactlons given back to them as incentives. This means that the platform has no aim of explanating users but rather having users to explore and exploit the entire activities and Catex system. The bonus will be given in the CATT token to as many as those who are the token holders and this will be done so frequently. In the catex network, users take part in decision making and that can be done through the airing of their opinions and what they think can be done to achieve progress. Catex has all the secondary duties managed by the users while it duly handles other primary tasks in the ecosystem.\n\nFor further information, visit [https://catex.io](https://catex.io/)",

            "text": "It will earn revenue from buy/sell fees, conversion fees, international debit card fees, and merchant settlement fees. Users should not worry about finding or trusting unproven crypto exchanges, which are mostly web-based and insecure\n\nMany crypto projects claim to be bringing crypto to the mainstream, but every one of them have failed to address all of the issues sufficiently. The Javvy team came together to share its knowledge and experience, leading to the realization that users do not need to know about crypto exchanges. What they do need is secure storage, secure access, and an easy way to buy and sell all major cryptocurrencies along with popular tokens in one comprehensive application that \u201cjust works.\u201d\n\nIn order to make the process of buying crypto faster and easier, the Javvy team has made great strides to address regulation roadblocks and exchange dilemmas that have plagued other providers. Javvy\u2019s regulation-centric approach requires registration only when buying or selling crypto, or when using their Javvy international debit card. Send, receive, and convert operations require no registration. With each person\u2019s security in mind, no user\u2019s private information will be stored on Javvy servers, leaving \u201cnothing for hackers to steal.\u201d Additionally, Javvy\u2019s exchange nurtures a fully-functional crypto-to-fiat and fiat-to-crypto conversion; not just a tethered coin, but a real solution to buy and sell using national currencies.\n\nIn a world where many businesses fall short of the customer satisfaction mark, Javvy management aims to provide the best user experience possible. Users will have access to easy-to-read support documentation as well as live support on the Javvy website, by phone, or directly from the app. The dedicated men and women that make up the Javvy support team are trained to translate the complex language of crypto into layman\u2019s terms to further facilitate mass adoption.\n\nThe Javvy (JVY) token will be used by the wallet for buy and sell transactions, which will act as an intermediary layer (patent pending). It will be immediately converted to avoid volatility, but will effectively reduce cryptocurrency reserve requirements, allowing for the easy addition of new coins and tokens supported by the Javvy wallet. The successful launch of Javvy will serve to further the development of the wallet, advanced features, national currency reserves, salaries, and marketing.\n\nThere are many aspects about the wallet tech that make it more secure. But, yes, being a non web-based application is the biggest step. There are already other crypto wallets that are not web-based, but there is much more to being secure than those wallets address. Also, the Javvy wallet will educate while providing options for 2-factor authentication (methods outside of mobile 2FA, for maximum security on mobile as well).\nOur wallet also encrypts everything on the device (some popular crypto wallets do not), and malware/ransomware cannot bypass the 2FA. There are other security features as well, but we must keep some things under wraps, as we've already basically laid out most of our plans publicly. These have already been used by Coinbase, and others, as a template or guide on how to improve their offerings. So, some things we keep to ourselves and rely on users to review our profiles (background and expertise) to see that we are very qualified to deliver this much needed solution for crypto users everywhere.\n\nWebsite\nhttps://javvy.com/\n\nWhite paper :\nhttps://javvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/javvy_crypto-solution-white-paper.pdf\n\nBounty0x username : @serkandereli27 ",

While most of the existing social media platforms and messaging apps are yet to provide its users with full anonymity and privacy, It is important to note that some of their basic designs aim at entrapping their users, stealing their personal data which are later being sold to the highest bidder. Sadly, should the victim attempt to retrieve the lost data, they pay heavily for it -- thereby sacrificing their rights to privacy.\n\nAccording to [this research](https://pr.report/zxXkHsPd), 55% of internet users have taken steps to avoid observation by specific people, government and organizations. More so, about 59% of internet users do not even believe that it is ever possible to achieve complete anonymity online. Statistically, this is a clear sign that so many people -- businesses and organisations alike have been affected in one way or the other, and the crypto industry is not left out.\n\nYes, there is always a brighter light at the end of the tunnel. Thanks to the saving platform -- Quarashi network. They understood that so many existing social media and messaging apps are able to monitor their users' activities even when they are not actively using the apps. From all indications, this simply translates to a complete loss of personal privacy. Well, Quarashi is the game changer. At Quarashi's, they believe that the full and unconditional dedication to privacy is the key answer to the numerous threats, sensitive data of individuals, businesses and even crypto wallets.\n\nYes, cryptocurrencies wallets also face a similar degree of privacy threats but it's unfortunate that many crypto maniacs don't realise this. Do you know that almost all cryptocurrencies on the market don't have an in-built privacy? So, unless the user's wallet is privacy-focused, all transactions -- sending and receiving can be effortlessly tracked by hackers. Inherently, there is an increasing demand for privacy-oriented wallets to protect against transactions being traced by bad actors. Quarashi is the core solution to this and more.\n\nPrimarily, Quarashi aims at becoming the world's most private, most secure and most anonymous chat application providing its users with untraceable identity while sending and receiving both traditional messages as well as cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nQuarashi Network is developing an ecosystem enabling sending and receiving communications and transactions in a truly private way. In fact, Quarashi Chat is the first messaging app that is fully privacy oriented. Obviously, Encrypted chat apps aren't something new, but it's crystal clear that they only give users an illusion of security. Many messaging apps only provide you with end-to-end encryption (E2E).\n\nQuarashi Chat is a decentralized, community-driven, fully secured and private messaging app in the Quarashi Platform which combines traditional end-to-end encryption (E2E) with a wide array of extra features massively enhancing users' privacy and anonymity. While most of the chat apps on the internet request you to disclose personal information such as your phone number or email address, Quarashi won't ask users that. The only thing you need to know is the username.That's why it's different. No phone number or email address is even required. With Quarashi's chat app, users can send and receive encrypted messages while being absolutely certain that your personal information remains private, anonymous and fully untraceable.\n\n \n\n[Website](https://quarashi.network/)\n\n[Whitepaper](https://quarashi.network/Quarashi-Whitepaper.pdf)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/QuarashiN)\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/quarashinetworkofficial)",

This allows you to send and receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. They come in many forms, from hardware wallets, which look like a USB stick. There are also online wallets, like the one of Privateum.\n\nPrivateum underwent a successful security audit just last August. On top of that Privateum is way better and safer than trusting your bank with asset management. Managing assets, yourself is fun to do and much more transparent than having brokers doing investments for you.",

Unlike the traditional wallets, cryptocurrency wallets don\u2019t really store your funds. In fact, your assets are simply part of a blockchain system as pieces of data, and the wallets serve to access them. All that exists are records of transactions stored on the blockchain.\n3. When a person sends you digital currency, they are essentially signing off ownership of the coins to your wallet\u2019s address. If the public and private keys match, the balance in your digital wallet will increase, and the senders will decrease accordingly.\u00a0\n\nThere are different types of crypto wallets but we\u2019re going to tell you about them at another time!",

            "text": "Welcome to PYE!\n\nFirst of all, imagine Christmas is just around the corner, your grandma asks you what it may be this year. Crypto is a great idea? Well, then I guess you'd have to wish for some good old cash, take it to the bank, then transfer it to a trading app, buy crypto, send it to a remote wallet... you realize your grandma wouldn't be able to do that. BUT, how about if there is a crypto ecosystem that even your grandma can operate? PYE!\n\nIn this article I will (briefly) show you why it is a (very) good idea to invest in PYE.\n\nI will focus on the following aspects: the team, the vision and the technology.\n\n**Team:** 16 members, all of who have presented themselves publicly. One member was even \"recruited\" directly from the community (Nosh) and is now our community leader! If you want to learn more about the team: [https://creampye.com/leadership-team/](https://creampye.com/leadership-team/)\n\nThere is also a video where (nearly) everyone from the team introduces themselves: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syA6UkHlQJM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syA6UkHlQJM)\n\n**Vision**: to make crypto accessible to the \"mass market\" while providing the best decentralized technology for it. Sounds simple, doesn't it? Well, with the team and their background, it will be a lot easier. What else? Stopping world hunger while donating to charities. Donations of about $300,000 have already been made to Action Against Hunger.\n\n**Technology**: the most important thing in the crypto world.\n\nAre you also annoyed by e.g. PancakeSwap?  V1 and V2 - whatever? No customer support? Then you should definitely be interested in the \"cream of the crop\": **PYESwap (Q3 2021)** \\-> a CEXDEX platform, in which the exchange of cryptocurrencies is made very easy. And if it should not work out sometimes? The PYE customer support is ( literally) close and will definitely help you.\n\nYou must know Venmo, right? What do you like the most about it? Probably the ease of use. PYE has also thought of that: **PYEWallet (Q2 2021)**. Actually, I've already said it all: as easy to use as Venmo but for crypto! So finally a crypto wallet with a \"real\" interface to the outside world. Someday paying with your PYEWallet in the online store of your choice - why not?\n\nWhat is actually doing the rest of the cryptocurrencies? What do the charts look like? Well, first close the one app, then go out of CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko and still end up with different prices. PYE has also thought of this: **PYEChart (Q2 2021)** \\->; A tracking app which, in addition to the usual functions (charts and data), also has a connection to PYESwap; so trading is as easy as ABC.\n\nHave I forgotten anything? Definitely, but I just wanted to give you a short overview.\n\nFor more detailed information, there is still the whitepaper, which you should definitely have a look at: [https://creampye.com/whitepaper/](https://creampye.com/whitepaper/)\n\n*Are you convinced or do you have any questions? Here are a few more important addresses:*\n\n\\-Website: [https://www.creampye.com](https://www.creampye.com)\n\n\\-Telegram Group: [https://t.me/creampyetoken](https://t.me/creampyetoken)\n\n\\-Twitter: [https://twitter.com/creampyetoken](https://twitter.com/creampyetoken)\n\n\\-Discord: [https://discord.gg/rT8GdwnN](https://discord.gg/rT8GdwnN)\n\nOf course, you can also visit us at the AMAs, which take place 3 times a week, and ask us any question you want!\n\n*Tokenomics?*\n\n- 1,000,000,000,000,000 Total minted PYE tokens\n- Fair Launch \u2013 300 Trillion Team Tokens Burned before launch\n- Marketplace Mining Rewards \u2013 100 Trillion Retained in Rewards Wallet for future deployment to PYE Platform users. \n- Rewards will be distributed over a five year timeframe.\n- PancakeSwap Initial Pool \u2013 600 Trillion staked with liquidity on PanCakeSwap DEX exchange.\n\n**Transaction Fees**\n- 5% of transactions will be distributed to all holders of PYE based upon percentage of holdings\n- 4.9% of transactions will be put automatically into Liquidity Pool Generation\n- 0.1% of transactions will go into a dedicated charity wallet to be distributed to our exclusive partner charity only.\n\n**Charity Burn**\n\nOf the extracted BNB:\n- 60% \u2013 Donated to Charity (Charities will be presented and voted upon by the PYE Community)\n- 20% \u2013 Marketing\n- 20% \u2013 Business and Operating Fund\nOf the Extracted PYE Tokens:\n- 60% \u2013 Burned Tokens\n- 40% \u2013 Community Giveaways",

Decentralized Exchanges are becoming increasingly popular as they enable anonymous transactions. and give traders full control of their funds while exposing traders to innovative DeFi tokens, which are usually not listed on centralized exchanges.\n\n\nYield Farming\nXPocket is the first cryptocurrency wallet with completely integrated yield farming. Users can lend their digital assets to the liquidity pools powering up the PocketSwap decentralized exchange, and earn money from trade fees while doing that.\n\n\nNFT Storing\n\nMost of the multi-wallets on the market only support one kind of Ethereum tokens: the ERC-20 tokens. XPocket also provides dedicated support for another up and coming Ethereum token standard: ERC-721.\n\nERC-721 tokens are more commonly known as NFT: Non-Fungible Tokens. The word non-fungible means that every single token is unique, as their intended purpose is being digital collectibles.

A cryptocurrency wallet is a secure digital wallet used for storing, sending, and receiving digital currency such as Bitcoin. While there are a plethora of crypto wallets to even begin with, those wallet types available depend on anyone's personal needs. Some wallets are built along with their cryptocurrency, some can be used for more than one crypto, and some will be kept in custody (like those found on exchanges). Suffice to say, there is a range of wallet types to choose from.\n\nChoosing the best crypto wallet is the difference between a secure cryptocurrency experience and a really bad one that sees all the hard-earned money being lost. Given the absence of regulatory frameworks on exchanges and cryptocurrencies as a whole and the industry's infancy, the best way to keep those coins safe is to have complete control over them. While choosing the right wallet can be intimidating, this article compiled the 2019 Top [Crypto Wallets](https://kucoinblog.com/top-crypto-wallets-2019-part-ii-sk-rd) according to their functionality, level of security and mobility for anyone's convenience. As with all crypto stuff, being secure online with crypto means having the best wallet available for cryptocurrency. In exploring the diverse and profitable world of cryptocurrencies, finding the right wallet is the first and possibly most important step.",

If you didn't, neither did I until some time ago and I thought it was one of those apps/exchanges/wallets in the line of coinbase and crypto.com that offer a lot, but are lacking in delivery. \n\nInstead of writing some glowing review, telling wonderful stories of riches to come (because we all yearn for riches in one way or the other) I'm going give you the basics, my experience and leave you to decide for yourself. \n\nYouhodler offers a range of options from exchange to a savings account and crypto loans to multiHODL. All of them having their respective risks and possible gains.\n\nFirst off is \n[Crypto loans](https://track.youhodler.com/click?offer_id=2&pid=721&sub2=Reddit&l=1582027396):\nA crypto-backed loan is a process of using cryptocurrency as collateral for a loan in a different currency. In YouHodler\u2019s case, you can choose from over the top 12+ cryptocurrencies as collateral for a loan in Euro (EUR) US Dollar (USD), or Great Britain Pound (GBP). Perhaps the most obvious benefit of crypto lending is that users can get instant access to fiat currency without having to sell their favorite crypto assets. This way, no one has to stress about missing out on a future bull run since when they pay the loan back, they get their crypto back.\n\nIn addition, there are more creative ways to use crypto loans for example, as a method to access new capital for investments, for hedging or leveraging on the crypto market and much more. There are a handful of crypto lending platforms offering these services but not all of them are created equal. \n\nWhy choose YouHodler for your crypto-backed loan?\n\nCompared to other crypto lending platforms YouHodler has a wide selection of some of the most popular crypto collateral options. YouHodler regularly adds more coins based on client demand and they are always improving the platform in this regard. In terms of a loan to value ratio, YouHodler lets users get more value for their collateral than competing lending platforms. Users can get an industry-best 90% loan to value ratio on YouHodler followed by instant credit card and bank withdrawals for ultimate convenience. \nUnlike other person to person (p2p) lending platforms, there is no need to find a lender. The instant cash comes from YouHodler\u2019s own fiat funds and it includes a proven custodial solution with a security fund of up to $1 million. Lastly, YouHodler has flexible repayment date and LTV options for those that want to customize their loans as well as a one-time loan fee that is repaid at the end of the loan term. No hidden rollover fees or daily reoccurring fees. \n\n\nNext is [Multi HODL](https://track.youhodler.com/click?offer_id=2&pid=721&sub2=Reddit&l=1582027398)\nMulti HODL \u2122  is an innovative concept based on the Barbell Strategy that helps crypto HODLers multiply their portfolio by investing some amount into a managed risk activities to produce higher yields. This strategy consists of ensuring 80% of your capital is invested in safe, risk-free assets. Meanwhile, the other 20% of the remaining capital is used for limited risk, but potentially highly profitable investments\n\nWhen you choose Multi HODL, the platform automatically takes a pre-determined percentage from a wallet of choice (e.g. crypto wallet or savings account) and uses those funds as collateral to initiate an automated \u2018chain of loans\u201d (based on YouHodler\u2019s Turbocharge feature). In this chain of loans, the funds from the first loan are used to buy more crypto to use as collateral for the next loan in the chain. This process is repeated up to ten times depending on your choice.\n\nYou can choose from over twelve cryptos to \u201cmultiply\u201d in the process as well as customize their risk level and set the desired \u2018take profit\u2019 point to close the position automatically. YouHodler states risk is limited with this feature and you cannot lose more than you set.\n\n\nWhy choose Multi HODL\u2122?\n\n[Multi HODL](https://track.youhodler.com/click?offer_id=2&pid=721&sub2=Reddit&l=1582027398) gives you the best of both worlds. Crypto traders can keep a large portion of their assets in safe wallets and profitable savings accounts.  Simultaneously, they can use a smaller portion to engage in riskier maneuvers to multiply their crypto via the chain of loans. If the value of their crypto goes up in the process, then the user covers the platform\u2019s interest fee and can keep the additional profit. If the value of the crypto goes down, then the trader can take comfort in the fact that 80% of their assets (plus interest)  are still secure in their savings account. \n\n\nConsidering this is an awful lot of text already.. I salute you if you've made it this far! There's still a lot more to go through but let me get to my own experience first:\n\nRegistration was a breeze.. instead of hanging in a dreadful verification limbo, my account got verified within an hour. That included ID and mail address verification. \n\nGetting crypto in (and out) was done in no time. So no worries there. \n\nAs far as multiHODL and loans go, it's like the package says more or less.. I haven't found anything weird yet..\nFor the curious ones:\n[Turbocharge](https://track.youhodler.com/click?offer_id=2&pid=721&sub2=Reddit&l=1582027397)\n The platform uses borrowed fiat to purchase additional cryptocurrency and then uses it as collateral for other loans in the chain. At the end of the chain, the user essentially has multiped crypto which they got from the initial investment. \n\n[Savings](https://track.youhodler.com/click?offer_id=2&pid=721&sub2=Reddit&l=1591352095)\n\nSo te recap, I could really recommend YouHodler.. \nThey pay out weekly, there's no need for staking and, without trying to sound too much like a salesman.. you can withdraw at any time.. \n\nBut don't take my word for it.. try yourself! \n[YouHodler](https://track.youhodler.com/click?pid=721&offer_id=2&ref_id={gclid}&sub2=Reddit)\n\nBy the way: thanks if you read through this whole thing! \ud83d\ude09",

FERRUM allows the management, deals, and exchange of any virtual asset, without taking care of consumer's asset.\n\nBuilt on the DAG (directed acyclic graph) network, it's faster, less expensive and more scalable than conventional block-chains. FERRUM is blocked agnostic, meaning it can aid assets for every network and is not restricted to ERC: 20 tokens.  \nThey've developed many decentralized cross-chain apps on peak of the network, including a decentralized crypto wallet and decentralized exchange, with more D-Apps in growth. Consumers can deposit their virtual asset into the network, generating a proxy asset of identical worth that can be transacted P2P using FERRUM Network wallet, or exchanged over FERRUM's decentralized exchange in milliseconds.\n\nThe FERRUM DEX also supports advanced features including top frequency trading, short selling and Artificial Intelligence drove trading assistance. Moreover, they're developing fiat gateways for the quick and cheap exchange of fiat money and digital money. After engaging in limitless rapid and cheap deals, consumers can safely withdraw their tokens to their actual block.\n\n**Problems and Ferrum's Solutions**\n\nI found FERRUM Network as a prominent program in early June 2018 and place it on the radar. Now it is not a stealth mode program anymore and they can take a look at it more deeply.\n\n\u2022 A major purpose of FERRUM Network is to create a top quality pace interoperability network for actual world financial apps. FERRUM aims to solve the actual issues of digital money usage in the conventional finance world: peak cost and low-speed deals, lack of interoperability, usage and recognizing hurdles for newcomers.\n\n\u2022 FERRUM Network will build a vertically integrated range of basics financial apps on top of the FERRUM Network that'll allow consumers to purchase, transact, exchange and store any virtual money with no counterparty threat.\n\n\u2022 In simple lines, FERRUM Network will create a layer, infrastructure that'll allow clients to buy commodities or services using any digital money in milliseconds without any issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor more details, please visit following links: \n\nWebsite: [https://ferrum.network/](https://ferrum.network/) \n\nWhitepaper: [http://whitepaper.ferrum.network/](http://whitepaper.ferrum.network/)",

            "text": "**Problem identified**\n\nXCOYNZ identifies three major issues that present a barrier to cryptocurrency adoption. The first one is complexity. The process of acquiring digital assets is not a straightforward one, as a user has to go through multiple steps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost crypto wallets are complex to use and usually support only one type of cryptocurrency. In addition, users have to manage multiple crypto wallets and it is not easy to transfer cryptocurrency to fiat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, high cost presents a major barrier to cryptocurrency adoption. Crypto exchange platforms have complicated and high fee structures that blocks out many small-scale crypto investors or traders from using the platforms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor instance, a Coinbase buyer will have to pay a fee of 149% for a standard buy or 3.99% for an instant buy. Generally, most exchanges charge between 0.1 and 0.5% on all transactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, lack of commercial support is another impediment to cryptocurrency adoption. The universal online payment systems currently used do not support cryptocurrencies. Merchants cannot afford the cost of bespoke equipment or new processes required for crypto transactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe team behind XCOYNZ believes that cryptocurrency will only replace traditional payment methods when it\u2019s established as simple and beneficial to adopt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rjplgi79tmy21.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=0da014881e454f1babe70cdfb932bf5272af9f8e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**XCOYNZ Solution**\n\nTo deal with the problems mentioned, the platform offers the following viable solutions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A reliable crypto exchange avenue**\n\nThis solution will address the problem of exchanging fiat to crypto and crypto to fiat, all under one roof. The component will be known as XCOYNZ Exchange, which will also address the issue of high fees by allowing the user to define the fee that they would like to pay for their transactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt will also speed up the transfer of Crypto assets back to the user\u2019s fiat bank account faster than other existing methods. This will be possible by utilizing the custom-built technology known as X-Swift that operates on a private XCOYNZ blockchain, processing transactions almost instantly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**XCOYNZ Smart Algorithm Wallet (SAW)**\n\nThe Smart Algorithm Wallet will consolidate all the user\u2019s crypto assets into a single wallet, which makes it easier to process payments faster and incur only a single fee that users themselves set and control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, the wallet will use smart algorithms to determine the best combination of assets to use to process payments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis, in the end will minimize costs and maximize on profits. Users can choose crypto assets suggested by the SAW or make their own choice as to which digital assets they would like to use. Another unique feature of the wallet is the ability to predict which crypto to HODL or sell.\n\n \n\n**WEBSITE**: [https://xcoynz.com](https://xcoynz.com/)\n\n**WHITEPAPER**: [https://xcoynz.com/WhitePaper-Full.html](https://xcoynz.com/WhitePaper-Full.html)\n\nBounty0x ID : hussnill",

Gokumarket steals the liquidity/market making and even the funds of the average users (from their personal Gokumarket wallets) of the tokens which are listed on Gokumarket to sell them on other exchanges. Users are unable to withdraw their funds since 3 months.\n\nThe Wanda.Exchange team tried to clear everything out with Gokumarket, so that Gokumarket delists Wanda.Exchange from the exchange and gives back all the WE token back to the team and also to the community which can't withdraw their funds since 3 months. Wanda.Exchange is in contact with the authorities in Estonia, Hong Kong and Thailand to take legal steps against Gokumarket.

You\u2019re just using a service like Visa as an intermediary between your cryptos and fiat money.\n\nHowever, this also means that now you don\u2019t really need to hold on to cash nearly as much as before.\n\nI barely even carry any cash around after I had a crypto Visa card issued from Eidoo wallet. I only carry around change in case I want to buy a bottle of water or some gum. Almost all my purchases are now done with my crypto Visa.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. These crypto credit cards first allow you to keep your funds in crypto making you able to invest more and not having to worry about running low on fiat. And secondly, most of them including mine offer crypto payback and trust me these small amounts add up.",

Currently the token is designed with anti-whale mechanics, holder rewards in BUSD and auto LQ. As this ecosystem evolves and develops, this token will be the way projects are funded, tied to the stability of BUSD. \ud83c\udfe7\n\n**Why do we need it?** \n\nCrowdfunding has not really changed since its implementation. While it is fairly accessible, it currently operates on a high-risk platform. With those who choose to pledge their funds against the possibility of a successful project, at high risk of losing all their funds should the project fail. Current crowdsourcing platforms also only operate as a facilitator of funds and market awareness, outside of this there is very little in the way of support and advice given to developers. This is what Pat aims to change. \u2699\ufe0f\n\n**How? \ud83d\uddc3**\n\nPat believes that the creation of an ecosystem that encourages accountability for developers, while providing security to investors and ongoing project support is key. The Pat ecosystem will ensure funding remains locked behind various milestone levels, meaning if a project fails the remaining funding will be returned to investors, providing them with a greater sense of security, as well as providing additional incentives to the developers to reach obtainable benchmarks. \n\nEach project will receive a tailored experience, with milestones and goals individually agreed within project guidelines. Pat will also provide support to project developers in areas they may have little or no understanding, such as business management, occupational safety and health, legal and regulatory hurdles specific to their area and additional consultancy services. \n\nWe at Pat, don\u2019t want to just be a financial facilitator, we want to be project cheerleaders, and do whatever we can to ensure projects become a reality. \ud83d\udcb1\n\n**Long term? \ud83d\ude80**\n\nLong term, we want to be able to provide access to crowdfunding and other financial services to as many individuals as possible. Once we have completed our crowdfunding platform, we have plans to expand our ecosystem to allow people to invest, save, trade and understand stock and shares, all within the blockchain. This is a new and emerging market, something that we believe will be a major part of financial systems over the next several years, and Pat wants to be at the front of that, especially considering how well crowdfunding will mesh with the individuals desire to take control of their own financial destiny. \ud83d\udcb0\n\n**Additional Info: \ud83d\udcb8**\n\nIf anything, we have said interests you, why not join us on this journey? This is a long-term project, with devs that are seriously committed to its long-term goals. Not an overnight pump and dump. We value community engagement, so if you don\u2019t want to invest right now, why not get in contact with us, join our social groups and learn more about us. We also have access to gaming servers for our holders, get involved in our community!\n\n[Website](https://www.patcoin.io)\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/SBeWNDqWY7)\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/PatCoinV2)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/coin_pat)\n\n**Token Statistics: \u2696\ufe0f**\n\n\u270510 percent tax\n\n\u27053 percent auto LQ\n\n\u27056 percent BUSD reflections \n\n\u27051 percent utility \n\n\u270510 billion total supply \n\n\u270550 million max buy/sell\n\n\u2705200 million max wallet holding \n\n\u2705Liquidity locked for 2 years",

            "text": "Similar to Fiat currency, Bitcoin (or most of the cryptocurrencies) is also not backed by any gold or silver hence does not have any intrinsic value\\*. The value of any currency comes from the backing of the state and the trust that people have over the government. Hence, for any money to be established as an exchange of value within a network, it is important for the network to trust it regardless of who (or what) is backing it.\n\nElectronic mode of payment is simply lesser use of traditional currency and direct exchange of value between two parties through a digital medium. We have witnessed a sudden shift to electronic method of payment in recent years due to its ease, transparency and accuracy. Hence, it is easier to find the source. With the introduction of Payment apps or wallet apps like Paytm, Google Pay, PhonePe etc, cashless mode of transaction has caught massive traction. Cashless mode of payment is one example for The Network Effect. Network effect in economics suggests that the value of a good increases with more number of people utilizing it.\n\nCryptocurrencies solve these problems with its decentralized infrastructure making direct money transfers quick, traceable, transparent, and immutable. Complying it to the principles of the network effect, cryptocurrencies will get more value as adoption increases. Having a single phone is pretty useless as no calls can be made through it. But as soon as the number of phones increases, the value increases exponentially. Hence, with Bitcoin, adoption is the factor which will play the leading role in adding value to it.\n\nBeyond the layman\u2019s narrative, economics defines two essential characteristics for a commodity to have value \u2013 Utility and Scarcity. Scarcity means a finite supply of goods or services. Bitcoin and many cryptocurrencies are limited currencies. That means, there is just a finite number of the same available. Bitcoin, for instance, has set a cap of 21 Million Bitcoins. Analysts note that this scarcity feature of Bitcoin increases its desirability over other assets including gold. With gold, although the supply is limited, we aren\u2019t really sure of the total amount available. A sudden influx of supply will crash prices and may hurt overall markets. However, a similar Gold Rush isn\u2019t possible with Bitcoin as no hidden treasure is going to be ever \u2018discovered\u2019.\n\nBitcoin comes with the security of Blockchain which makes it difficult to counterfeit or to play around with. Another point here is that Bitcoin has a cap of 21 million units out of which 17.3 million are in circulation. The program used to create or mine bitcoin will simply stop once the set number is achieved. This makes Bitcoin accountable in itself. As mentioned above BitCoin has a value in itself. It is free from the worry of finding an appropriate store of the value that is there inherently in Fiat money.\n\nAdding to this, Today a cryptocurrency gets its utility as a mode of payment due to two key factors \u2013 **Transaction Costs and Transaction Time**. Cost to transfer a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is near minimal as the number of parties involved is technically only two. It\u2019s more like a cash transaction done digitally. This reduces the overall cost of transactions significantly. With the added security layer provided by Blockchain, this is perhaps the safest way to transfer value digitally.\n\nTransaction Time or time to realize the payment in the seller\u2019s account is in the tune of a few minutes at max with crypto-currencies. Compare this with days with traditional fiat currencies. A global e-commerce major like Amazon, which has millions of transactions in a day globally cannot afford such high costs as well as cash-flow challenges. Hence, today globally, many companies have started collecting payments using Bitcoin or similar cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs seamless as, the change has been from the traditional mode of exchange to electronic mode, Cryptocurrency has the potential to be as swift and seamless in adoption and as more and more people will accept it, its value will increase. It will be a strong alternative to money and has the potential to become a truly global currency.\n\nRight now I'm looking into a few young and refreshing projects: Kitty Cake, Studyum, Momento, Spores, Starcoin and Saitama inu. They have a lot of room t grow and the communities are really great.",

            "text": "Thanks to El Salvador's daring move, digital money is high on the radars of policymakers around the world.\n\n**On September 7, in a historic event, the small Central American nation of El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as its legal tender.**\n\nThe true significance of this day to the way people around the world exchange value and the meaning they attach to the concept of money will take some time to be fully reified and understood. However, what is already clear is that September 2021 will be next to January 2009 in the history books of the digitization of finance.\n\n**Surrounded by controversy, protests, a complicated deployment of infrastructures, what else? But also by the joy and optimism of millions of people around the world who see this great experiment with hope, \"Bitcoin Day\" marked the first case of a sovereign state that makes a decentralized digital asset its national currency. Was it a success, after all?**\n\n## Politics behind the scenes\n\nEl Salvador, a nation of less than 7 million people, has long given up on claiming its monetary sovereignty **. In 2001, it ditched the col\u00f3n, its national currency in use for more than a century, in favor of the US dollar.** The measure made a lot of sense from a practical point of view, since the share of remittances (a good part of them coming from Salvadorans living in the United States) in the country's gross domestic product exceeded 16% at peak times.\n\nAt that time, then-President **Francisco Flores P\u00e9rez's move** sparked protests and was condemned by detractors who claimed it was undemocratic and supposedly benefited the bankers and the wealthy.\n\n**Two decades later, President Nayib Bukele (a 40-year-old man who came to power at the head of a party called New Ideas) added another chapter to El Salvador's monetary novel, this time, complementing a foreign currency circulating in the country. with one without borders.**\n\nLike 20 years ago, **there have been negative reactions in relation to the Bitcoin Law.** However, **the same surveys showing a lack of support for Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a new means of payment suggest that a large portion of Salvadorans have a limited understanding of what it is and how it will affect their lives.**\n\nFurthermore, in many cases, resentment towards Bitcoin may be related to resentment towards Bukele, who, despite his strong approval ratings, remains a divisive figure whose alleged autocratic tendencies concern some international observers.\n\nIn summary, there are good reasons to believe that there is no powerful ideological opposition to the concept of decentralized finance in El Salvador, and any resistance that currently exists will likely dissipate further down the adoption curve (if the implementation turns out to be a resounding success).\n\n## The uproar in the country\n\n**Meanwhile, the somewhat hasty launch of the payments infrastructure was, unsurprisingly, far from perfect. The government-run Chivo wallet was down for several hours, and some retail workers didn't know how to process BTC payments.** Shortly after launch, the president himself took on the customer support role, tweeting updates on the status of the wallet's service.\n\nOverall, however, based on feedback from those who were there to witness El Salvador's first steps as a \"Bitcoin nation\", things started to calm down soon after a turbulent start. **Bart Mol, founder, and host of the \"** ***Satoshi Radio*** **\" podcast tweeted his experience from Chivo's ATMs not working to successful Lightning transactions to pay for pizza and coffee at different points of sale.**\n\nThe general feeling, Mol concluded, was to **\"witness history.\"**\n\n## International response\n\nThe institutions of the global financial system seem less enthusiastic. **The International Monetary Fund has been passive-aggressive regarding El Salvador's Bitcoin Law since it was passed earlier this summer. Perhaps, if this experiment yields favorable results, the IMF and other global financial organizations will jump on the bandwagon?**\n\nSome legal professionals are skeptical of this prospect. **During an \"Ask Me Anything\" (AMA) session on Discord with Cointelegraph Markets Pro subscribers last week, Cointelegraph General Counsel Zachary Kelman opined that global financial institutions are unlikely to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon as National currency:**\n\n\"The cited reasons (environment and transparency) for opposing the adoption of BTC by El Salvador are not the real reasons, which is the threat that the [development of cryptocurrency ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development)poses to the established global political order and the banking system. Therefore I don't think these international bodies are widely supporting Bitcoin. \"\n\nHowever, other nation-states are watching closely. It is true that El Salvador's position as the leader in remittances in the region, combined with its previous experience in outsourcing the national monetary function to a foreign currency, constitutes a rare combination. Most other countries have to rise to a higher bar, even if they could muster the political momentum to make a decentralized token recognized as legal tender.\n\nStill, the possible favorable effects of El Salvador's move could prompt other countries to consider Bitcoin more seriously as a means of payment. **Amanda Wick,** head of legal affairs at blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, **told Cointelegraph that** [**cryptocurrency development**](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) **is an ideal technology for remittances and is therefore well-positioned to serve economies that handle many remittances:**\n\n\"Many citizens \\[in El Salvador\\] do not have access to traditional financial services, and this could drive financial inclusion. These drivers can give us an idea of \u200b\u200bwhich countries can follow suit. In our research, we have found that these use cases are already popular in countries in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia in particular. \"\n\n**The acceleration of the digital currency research programs of the central banks of other countries, the push to define the legal status of cryptocurrencies in Ukraine,** and the discussions to make cryptocurrencies **a legal alternative payment method in Panama** can be seen as carryover effects of El Salvador's daring initiative.\n\n**Obviously, not all states are in a position to adopt Bitcoin as their national currency.** But on September 7, virtually everyone was driven to rethink their position on the world's digital money map.\n\n**Regardless of the outcome of El Salvador's experiment, the pioneering example of the Central American nation has already brought cryptocurrency to the mainstream political agenda more than it could achieve without the recognition of a sovereign state.**",

            "text": "We are at a critical point in history for two major reasons: our expedition of climate change, and the natural redistribution of wealth that is happening right now.\n\nIt is now scientific consensus that humans have contributed significantly towards climate change and caused irreparable ecological damage ranging from plastic in our oceans to habitat destruction. With this data and subsequent conclusions only decades old, we have yet to figure out a plan to heal. Global powers focus on reducing consumption and carbon taxes to do the heavy lifting. Large corporations invest in renewable energy and other technology. Municipalities create incentives to encourage sustainability through programs and other forms of investment. Common citizens can take incremental steps in their daily decisions, specifically the products that they purchase and the means of delivering them.\n\nWhat has accelerated humans to the top of the planet\u2019s custodial chain is our ability to adapt and evolve. Yet this is the same paradox that causes a lot of the problems we see today. We want more, quicker, faster and for less. We are evolving our processes and procedures for living at a faster rate than the Earth can currently support. This will be the same mechanism that will be the cause of our ultimate demise.\n\nAnother natural cycle that appears time and time again is the redistribution of power and wealth. Super powers come and go; wars, revolutions, natural events all prompting metachanges in the way we run our communities, countries and more recently, our planet.\n\nCryptocurrencies are providing an alternative to the archaic value structure that governs the world. Fiat currencies, such as USD, GBP, and EUR to name a few, are all inflationary and underwritten by basically nothing (ironically the same argument used by those afraid of crypto against cryptocurrencies). No longer is there a \u2018gold standard\u2019. No longer does that bank actually have enough physical cash to cover all its debts. When you scratch beneath the surface of our current financial system, the house of cards becomes painfully apparent.\n\nThe future of money is in shared value, and adoption. Yes, gold and silver are ultimately physical assets that have real world uses and are finite, but their extraction is harmful to the planet, and they do not underwrite the fiat currencies that run the world anymore. There is absolutely no reason why a cryptocurrency cannot fulfill the role of \u2018global store of value\u2019. Personally, I see these cryptocurrencies being those that are non-inflationary, or even deflationary by nature, such as Bitcoin. I see these more as assets, similar to \u2018digital gold\u2019 as has often been described before.\n\nBut Bitcoin in it\u2019s current form cannot fulfill the role of \u2018medium of exchange\u2019 of value. It is too slow, expensive and environmentally harmful to mine given the outdated proof of work system. This is where other blockchains come into their own. Again, ideally finite, but faster, cheaper, and greener, such as Elrond, Algorand, Cardano, and Ethereum, to name a few.\n\n[PlanetPay](https://planetpay.io/) bridges the gap between these two huge problems facing humanity today. PlanetPay will leverage blockchain technology for doing what it does best \u2014 removing middlemen from value transactions \u2014 most obviously in the financial space. Merchant fees will remain, albeit low, but instead of those fees going to banks, they will be redistributed to environmental causes. This approach costs the consumer absolutely no more than when using your credit or debit card today. Yet the planet stands to gain from every transaction you make.\n\nPlanetPay is starting life on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), to take advantage of its low fees and high speed. It is beginning as a community token to build a following and address the issues of awareness and adoption. This is referred to as \u2018Phase 1\u2019. The value of the PlanetPay token will be much lower at the start of life, and therefore at the beginning there is a 5% transaction fee in order to cover the project\u2019s development and to start building the environmental funds (this is broken down as a 2% development fee, 2% to the environmental fund, but also 1% redistributed to holders of the token as a reward for holding).\n\nPhase 2 will see the use of presale funds go towards bringing in top talent from the blockchain and traditional payment worlds. This is referred to as the \u2018project delivery\u2019 phase. With the $PLANET token being exchanged on the open market, its natural value will be derived over time.\n\nPhase 2 will offer an app wallet to store the $PLANET tokens, one for merchants and one for consumers. It is likely that there may also be an NFC enabled cash card too for early adopters, of course printed onto hard biodegradable materials such as card, not plastics. Merchants accepting $PLANET tokens will display a sign in their shop window or on their websites. And the rest remains largely the same for the consumer. You head to your favourite coffee shop or store that accepts PlanetPay and simply tap your card or phone to purchase your items, exactly the same as you do today. Yet 1% of the transaction will go to environmental projects as voted for by the community (being anyone that holds PlanetPay tokens). Imagine if that happened for every transaction, made by every person on the planet. Just think of the good that we could do!\n\nThe world is waking up to digital currencies. This idea is not new. Governments are in a race to create their own Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Admittedly these will be faster to be adopted due to governments imposing them upon their citizens. Yet these offer little to no security for the individual, with every transaction being scrutinised by the powers that be, and a real risk of confiscation should the ruling power decide that a debt is due. I see this as a Big Brother move, and that is why I personally will not be adopting CBDCs in a hurry, although they will have a role to play in the future of money. Decentralised, privately owned global digital currencies like PlanetPay (amongst others) offer a solution to the above problems.\n\nThe global team behind [PlanetPay](https://planetpay.io/) are all business-savvy entrepreneurs and developers. There is a wealth of experience we bring that is not often found in new BSC token launches, and much thought has gone into the project to date. This is not just an idea. There is a clear roadmap through Phase 1 and into Phase 2.\n\nThe stage is set. It\u2019s time to phase out the concept of traditional financial payment models in exchange for community enabled currencies that are not able to be manipulated by governments and authorities, and that solve two of the biggest threats we face as human beings today: the destruction of this planet we call home, and the demise of money as we know it.\n\n**Twitter**  \n[https://twitter.com/Planetpayio](https://twitter.com/Planetpayio)\n\n**Telegram**  \n[https://t.me/planetpayofficial](https://t.me/planetpayofficial)\n\n**Website**  \n[https://www.planetpay.io](https://www.planetpay.io/)\n\n**Whitepaper**  \n[https://planetpay.io/static/60952b05f3076157cb349c70/t/6114f2dd7a9cac0163c60781/1628762856906/PlanetPay.io+Whitepaper+v2.2.1.pdf](https://planetpay.io/static/60952b05f3076157cb349c70/t/6114f2dd7a9cac0163c60781/1628762856906/PlanetPay.io+Whitepaper+v2.2.1.pdf)",

I am a big believer that $PVM is going to re-shape the chain security landscape. On top of that Privateum is way better and safer than trusting your bank with asset management. Managing assest yourself is fun to do and much more transparent than having brokers doing investments for you. I was looking to optimize the return on my assets, found Privateum and they provide an excellent technological and legal solution-based community platform that enables private assets management.\n\nAnyone else having good experiences w/ Privateum so far?",

The coins and tokens bought and stored in wallets are not readily acceptable in your favorite Taqueria, pizza place or pub.  The wife calls and asks you to get almond milk on the way home, and the local bodega does not accept cryptocurrency. \nThis is where Goji\u2019s Payment Software as a Service platform comes in, an easily accessible plug-in to any brick and mortar business who wants to adopt cryptocurrency payments. This is the  last mile to mass adoption of cryptocurrency as a true medium of exchange in the real world. This is the realization of decentralized finance as it relates to real businesses and it\u2019s customers.\nCurrently, as news have started to trickle out, it is the Amazons and Walmarts of the World that are hiring blockchain/cryptocurrency leads, to build out their own system in-house, to take advantage of the emerging and, dare I say, inevitable cryptocurrency adoption in society. But what will you do if your company does not have the business development resources, what do you do if you do not even have the competency to hire a blockchain expert, let alone to build your own crypto-payment infrastructure. Enter GojiCrypto as an SaaS payment platform provider, a one stop solution for businesses who have neither the time, expertise, or the resource to build out its own crypto-payment system. GojiCrypto offers a transparent, auditable, and easy to use single pane dashboard for the business end to make and receive crypto-payments. It will come to be as simple as interfacing with a point-of-sale device while GojiCrypto takes care of the complex blockchain transactions at the backend, thereby  allowing existing Human resource to be maintained with minimal retraining. GojiCrypto will take care of the business so it can focus on what is most important, it\u2019s customers. \nSo when that traditional Taqueria in your community will finally take the leap into cryptocurrency, GojiCrypto will make it happen, welcome to the future.

            "text": " **CLAIMANT AND FEES STRUCTURE**\n\n With Inzura token, the claimant is leveraged to 5 times the Fixed Audited Price (FAP) value, making the investor's asset worth 5 times their purchase. User's crypto worth is estimated at the time of claiming the premium. Every successfully verified claim will be settled in the form of ETH or BTC in the value of USD to their registered wallet, in which the settlement mode may be changed on further discussion with the community members in view of beneficiary wellness consideration. Every claim settlement is subjected to variable GST of 5% of total settlement and 5% processing and service charge. GST percentage may vary according to the allocated slab which is variable. The coins that can be claimed are BTC and ETH. At the time of platform launch, users can expect these coins as an introductory to be able to purchase premium towards. Further addition of coins and tokens will be made with further discussions and meeting with the Inzura community and voting process. The hack and loss of coin is confirmed when the particular exchange that is hacked has officially confirmed about their hack and loss. The next process will be confirmation with the press release and media report. Backend data verification will be processed with the exchange and further investigation will be undertaken. User that are affected by the hack in that particular exchange should immediately report and claim the premium within 72 hours. Backend claim process will be initiated once the claim is submitted. The claim approval or rejection status will be notified within 1-2 weeks, which in some case the process of approval or rejection status may take even further unless clear documents and verification is confirmed. Premium maturity is 24 hours from the time of premium purchase. Users cannot claim the premium before their premium maturity. Premium maturity is implemented to avoid users from purchasing premium towards already hacked exchange which pertains to fraudulent activity \n\n **DOCUMENTATION**\n\n Documentation should be submitted for every premium that is purchased. Documents may contain screen capture with time and date. User should provide the username, email ID, and other necessary details for account verification. Documents will not include password, OTP, 2FA, private key, or other related details that may lead to user's asset access. In any given point in time, no members or representative from Inzura will ask for password or OTP (One Time Password) for verification or for any queries, do not share password or other related data. Users are responsible for their asset security. Users should report Inzura if any member pretending to be Inzura representative or member that tries to get password related information. \n\n**TOKEN MECHANISM** \n\n The Inzura token mechanism clearly explains the process involved in the Inzura ecosystem. The mechanism is a circuit like path where it starts with the user and ends with the user. The system is triggered when the user claims the premium. The necessary protocol is undertaken and sent to the verification team, where they verify all the resource available and cross verify each data available. If the claim is found to be not legit or suspicious of any fraudulent activity, then the system rejects the claim and sends the token back to the user's wallet with penalty. If the claim is legit and all resource is confirmed, then the claim will be approved and transferred to the sanctioning team. All necessary process will be done and the protocol settles the claimant to the user. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Webpage\n\n [https://www.inzura.world/#/home](https://www.inzura.world/#/home) \n\nThe WP\n\n [https://www.inzura.world/static/media/Inzura%20Whitepaper%20v1.2.1.93dfbde0.pdf](https://www.inzura.world/static/media/Inzura%20Whitepaper%20v1.2.1.93dfbde0.pdf) \n\nBounty0X ID: hllelek33",

Some of the services and applications are provided free of charge; others can be purchased or paid for through licensing agreements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Main components of the VALOR Platform**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsortium and public blockchain\n\nCertain circumstances require assets to be deployed on the VALOR Chain or another private blockchain - e.g. asset issuers' requirements, regulatory constraints. In other instances, assets can be deployed to a public blockchain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApp marketplace\n\nThird party providers or individual contributors can build applications on top of the VALOR Platform. The community can purchase or license these apps via the app marketplace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nICO platform with tokenization engine\n\nBuilt-in smart contract sub-modules combine and are parameterized to represent the asset to be tokenized. The existence, legal ownership and status of the underlying assets are ensured via a dedicated process during asset issuance. This includes checking legal documents, institutional audits and notary deposits. Appropriate safeguards (e.g. custody) are taken to check that the token model/smart contract is consistent with the asset.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTask marketplace\n\nThe VALOR Platform enables decentralized value creation. Contribute your Participants can contribute their expertise where they can, with coding, research, performance predictions and more. Positive reviews from the community, an accurate performance prediction, etc., will build their publicly verifiable reputation and increase their earning potential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGovernance and voting engine\n\nAs a decentralized network, the governance of a large proportion of the VALOR Platform is in the hands of the community, who can vote on decisions, contribute to polls, introduce petitions, and more. Some central responsibility is needed at the start of the platform's life, particularly around regulatory compliance matters. But once the community is big enough, with services capable of managing it, more decentralized governance will be sustainable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRewards and bounty programs\n\nActive stakeholders can earn rewards from participating in the VALOR Platform in a way that upholds what it stands for. Examples are engagement in opinion polls, being involved in governance matters, giving input on new assets being considered for listing, providing capital and liquidity etc. The reward program can also be deployed by asset issuers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDecentralized auctioning marketplace\n\nA smart contract-enabled auction marketplace facilitates price discovery and supports liquidity in infrequently traded assets, for both investors and asset issuers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLicensed exchange\n\nList and trade asset tokens and cryptocurrency on the VALOR exchange, which accommodates all regulatory constraints.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAuthentication and identity\n\nRobust protocols are in place to authenticate and manage user IDs. Multi-factor authentication is implemented.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecure custody for crypto assets\n\nHold your tokenized assets safely and securely in VALOR accounts or wallets.

This is a feature that meets the confidence part of the business. Therefore, smart contracts are particularly important for crypto money transfer. Things get mixed up when it comes to the technical information threshold. Because smart contracts are simple as functions, they have technically very complex structures. Blockchain Link is fully engaged here and makes smart contracts accessible.\n\nBlockmason Link Link is a project focused on the fact that smart contracts, which are one of the foundations of blockchain technology, can be accessed without the need for detailed technical information. Especially with the entry of blockchain technology into our lives, we can say that the need for smart contracts and project development processes is an innovation. Especially the vision of Blockmason Link is proof of how innovative the project is in terms of its scope.\n\nAlthough Blockchain technology has entered our lives, the development of blockchain is a medium that requires highly technical knowledge and coding to begin. Data science, coding languages, and the process goes on. On the ordinary user side that is not on the development side of the business, there are some difficulties such as wallets, transfer difficulties and security. Link is here to offer a range of solutions to users and developers.\n\nBlockmason Link's Features The first feature is the use of Link to say that you don't need any blockchain experience to use. In other words, Link is a new user-friendly structure. This is a very effective solution, especially for the technical part of the work that is intimidating.\n\nAs a second feature, for users and developers, Linux is no different from other web APIs. In other words, Link does not need to define the crypto coin or plug-in. This is a very important solution, especially for those who want to experience a smart contract.\n\nThird, Link offers users a simple and familiar application experience. In this way, users can overcome the technical information threshold, but the experience of using Link is provided.\n\n[https://blockmason.link/](https://blockmason.link/)",

I will say its pros and cons as I've been here since the start.\n\nThe pros: The website looks very professional which it's getting rarer in this pump and dump land. The Devs are constantly in the groups, very responsive and making marketing campaigns so more people know and want to invest into the token. They instantly burnt the LP after creating it and took the simple step of verifying the contract, so we can take a look at the launch.\n\nOne thing that is quite neat of this token is the liquidity and redistribution system. Every time someone makes a transaction, 2% of the total amount is locked into liquidity diluting the selling price impact and reinforcing the price floor.\n\nAlso, they will be adding NFTs and mining, I don't really know how but I'm here for the long run so we'll see if they make good on their promises.\n\nThe cons is that it's another token with safe tokenomics and doesn't have a use case at the moment, you just hold it waiting for the price to rise.\n\nThe team wants to stay anon, but I don't think that's good nor bad, this is crypto, none of you guys wants to be doxxed.\n\nSo, to finish this up. Why should we give them our money?\n\nWell, it's up to you really. I gave you my thoughts and will leave some info down below. I'm staying because I took a liking to the team and the token aesthetics.\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\nTotal supply: 1.000.000 \n\nDistribution System: 6% tax of each transaction, 4% redistributed among holders and 2% locked into liquidity. \n\nInitial liquidity: 98% of supply linked with 1 BNB\n\nTransactions: Capped at 0.5% of the total supply. \n\nDEV\n2% Supply linked to DEV wallet. \n\nContract: 0x69Af49E82eA59A97F3879547f67B913c216C3714\nVerified contract. \nVerified deploy wallet and its transactions. \n\nLP burned bscscan.com/tx/0x8881ffa13f94b09da33e8e34e72291dec19520b8ce340300ed5cd705105bd16f\n\n\nWeb: https://www.unitinetwork.com/\n\nMedium: https://unitiprotocol.medium.com/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/UNITiProtocol",

            "text": "\ud83c\udf19 Mooncoins (MNC): A Moonshot with Real\u00a0Utility\n\n*Deflationary coin with tokenomics designed for rapid growth and with sustainability achieved through utility.*\n\nPresale Countdown: [https://countingdownto.com/?c=3548882](https://countingdownto.com/?c=3548882)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Today is the day we take-off! \ud83c\udf16 17:00 UTC \\[17th April (Saturday)\\]\u23f0\n\n**The Mooncoin Vision**\n\nThe aim of [Mooncoin](https://moonwallet.org/) is no different from the original vision for blockchain and cryptocurrency: to provide a trustless, permissionless, fully decentralised, non-custodial store-of-value that can be transferred, traded, and transacted without the need for any intermediaries; To eliminate the intercession of any centralised authority; To ensure that this store of value is fundamentally protected from concerns such as inflation, achieved by placing hard limits on supply via provable mathematical algorithms.\n\nMooncoin aims to expand on these goals but in rather a modern way, building on top of more recent innovations in the cryptocurrency space. Mooncoin will provide a store-of-value that takes these principles yet further, ensuring that a truly decentralised system for wealth accumulation and spending is made available in a much more grassroots fashion than possible with more traditional cryptocurrencies.\n\n**About The Team?**\n\nThis is a fairly ambitious project for a moonshot/hype coin project but we have an experienced and talented team who have built and scaled tech companies and worked experience in big crypto projects like Polkadot. We also know and have worked with each other outside of the crypto world.\n\nMooncoin for us is a long-term project. It retains a marketing and development fund wallet which will be used to develop Mooncoin and ensure its growth and success. Our singular aim is to turn Mooncoin into a decentralised financial services powerhouse and thus generate enormous wealth for all its holders.\n\n**The Problem**\n\nRugs are almost a daily practice this day, with developer dumping being a common occurrence. As the popularity of the BSC chain grew the low gas fees attracted a lot of new incumbents into this space some of whom are just here to scam people.\n\nFurthermore, despite this rapid growth, these tokenomics have a strong tendency to go through significant \u201cdumping\u201d phases when those who have generated wealth decide to \u201ccash out\u201d on their positions.\n\nWhen the cycle of selling begins, it decimates the TVL of the cryptocurrency and also erodes investor confidence. These events can have the effect of starting an avalanche of investor-flight, killing the currency off entirely.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nMooncoin sets out to solve this by adjusting the tokenomics to more strongly discourage selling while providing utility for holders. The majority of tax (20% of the transaction amount) is derived from sellers. Buying transactions are taxed at half the rate (10%). This tax is split 50\u201350 between redistribution and providing liquidity.\n\nMooncoin adds utility to hodling by adding a payments system. This allows investors to accrue and hold Mooncoin and build wealth, but minimise sell transactions until they actually need to spend it. The spending features of Mooncoin payments are tax-free, encouraging users to take this route as opposed to losing 20% upon \u201cdumping\u201d mooncoin on the market and dropping the TVL and price for holders.\n\n**Mooncoin Ecosystem**\n\nThe Mooncoin Ecosystem has been designed from the ground up to embrace DeFi. It consists of three core financial products:\n\n\u25cf **Mooncoin:** The currency that serves as a deflationary store-of-value\n\n\u25cf **Moonwallet:** A DeFi wallet that locks-in savings and builds wealth through reflection auto-staking\n\n\u25cf **Mooncard:** A tax-free payments system to spend your mooncoin freely and conveniently\n\nWe have plans to provide our Moonwallet as an integration into the Mooncoin website at moonwallet.org and also as a standalone app. Moonwallet will be used to autostake Mooncoins, trade them, to mint and collect NFTs, and to trade and hold other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWe will further work with partners to integrate Moonwallet with other payment systems and providers.\n\n**Mooncoin NFTs**\n\nMooncoin NFTs will allow users to mint NFTs of varying denominations. These NFTs are reversible and can always be unminted, returning 95% of the original Mooncoin tokens consumed in the minting process.\n\nMinting NFTs takes Mooncoins out of circulation, creating added scarcity. A 5% tax is applied for each unmounting operation which has the added effect of permanently burning Mooncoins and increasing scarcity.\n\n**How To Find Out More?**\n\n\ud83d\udd35 Telegram Chat: [https://t.me/MooncoinDeFi](https://t.me/MooncoinDeFi)\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Website: [https://moonwallet.org/](https://moonwallet.org/)\n\n\ud83d\udd4a Twitter: [https://twitter.com/MooncoinDeFi](https://twitter.com/MooncoinDeFi)",

Due to regulations, some restrictions apply to regions or countries and may not be available. Information related to KYC, AML regulations will be published on our partner'S website. The registration itself requires an e-mail, password, and cell phone number for initial verification of the transaction.\n\nEach customer will have to undergo an authentication process that will allow us to increase withdrawal limits and allow us to provide the security and procedures required by law. Our support will work 24 hours a day and will constantly review all relevant issues. We also think about the possibility of a document verification process from Trulioo and Jumio.\n\nThen, after verification, the customer can open a special account or transfer to our Fiat account. Deposit from Fiat depends on the service or bank that the customer will provide us with an account. From time to time, the Security Department may suspect a failure or simply ask for another verification in a random selection - everything for security. 95% of the user funds are protected by additional security in the CoinCasso OU cold wallet. The token provides a higher level of protection against theft.\n\nThe security of Fiat protection is secured by banks cooperating with CoinCasso OU. The platform is to provide a security process for user accounts. Log in to the account after additional 2FA verification or post SMS verification has been performed. In some cases, there are more confirmations that are required for e-mail. The entire login history is available to users. All transactions made by our platform are saved and shared in a user-friendly format. Private data is encrypted. State-of-the-art technologies protect the server from falling and theft. Third-party servers will test interaction nodes and published results.\n\n[CoinCasso Website](https://coincasso.io/)\n\n[Whitepaper](https://coincasso.io/ENGLISH_CoinCasso_official_PLV1.pdf?v1.1)\n\nBounty0x username : Emrah0406",

It is distinctive in its Gold Rewards programme, whereby, users holding Gigzi Black at the end of a reward cycle are paid Gigzi Gold crypto-assets. This ensures users that invested in the Gigzi ecosystem also share in its success.\n\nThe Gigzi Metal is stable and secure; this is achieved by anchoring the price to precious metal. 1 Gigzi Metal is equal to 1 gram of its respective precious metal. The tokenisation of precious metals by Gigzi provides users with a stable asset in which to invest their wealth on the blockchain, as well as enabling users to hedge and limit exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe world-renowned Perth Mint has been chosen to provide the precious metal that backs Gigzi Metal crypto-assets.\n\nFor more information, please visit: https://www.gigzi.com/",

            "text": " \n\nThe veil is always an open crypto currency. In most crypto currencies, privacy is an option only in the user's wallet, meaning that the user can spend anonymously or in a more private way.\n\nTechnically speaking, the niqab project, like other Zeroco-focused projects, has two types of coins: bazcoins and zerocoins. In most other projects, users must manually fill their bazoco with zerocoins, if they choose. With napkin, bazcoins are automatically placed in Zerocoins above 10 bazcoins. In other words, when a user has at least 10 bascoines, it is automatically dipped into the zero-mine. The reason for the existence of two coins and the fact that each coin is not printed on Zero is because they are the same currency (veil), because they have an affordable cost of printing and spending on zero currency. Please note that an average user doesn't have to worry about eventually seeing a balance\n\nIn veil, bascoin operations are made anonymous using RingCT and secret addresses. RingCT is a method of making the sender's digital signature anonymous by combining the sender's digital signature with random other signatures from the block chain's history, creating a final, unique signature. Then, using a range proof, the amount of transactions is hidden. Eventually, the network does not recognize the sender or the amount in a transaction, but by using an encryption key image, miners can verify that the transaction is valid and that there is no double expense.\n\nNow, each 10 bazcoin automatically switches to 1 Zerocoin type, where only 10 napkins are available. This is the relationship of Veil between the logic of RingCT and Zerocoin. While RingCT anonymizes bazcoco, Zerocoin provides the highest level of privacy for the sender.\n\nWebsite :: [https://veil-project.com/](https://veil-project.com/)\n\nBTT : [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5065331](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5065331)",

Using JV you download the wallet and it is similar to cold wallets like Ledger etc. This way you can sleep easy.\n\n Because it's cryptocurrencies you keep your private key and you're on it, you have to be really careful and watch out for any Intruders. Not being online all the time helps you sleep easy. I have heard from a CEO that their platform was DDOS attacked although they were using Cloudflare which is supposed to prevent such attacks.\n\n What I like about JV is that they have finished a lot of their development and they seem to have a good team or did you working in a building. Their soft cap is high and it is about half a million dollars and usually, ICOs do not put that high of a soft cap. This clearly shows their confidence and gives me confidence in this platform.\n\n They're also using a new system where they only generate tokens as needed. This means that they will not be producing too many tokens and then burning the rest which is not sold. To be honest it is an efficient system and I applaud Javvy for it.I think they are going to do it just fine and use their knee system that is worth more than an exchange successfully. \n\nWebsite https://javvy.com/\n\nWhite paper : https://javvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/javvy_crypto-solution-white-paper.pdf\n\nBounty0x username : mstuna",

When someone creates a playlist, curates music content, vote for songs, or simply listen to music, they receive IMU Tokens into their wallets. To say it short, every type of known activity linked to digital music creation and management is compensated on the platform, while royalties collection and copyrights are tracked efficiently thanks to smart contracts issuance. So anytime the song of an artist is played on a third-party \u2014 TV, film, radio \u2014 artists can receive IMU Tokens into their digital wallet as imusify enables proper royalties tracking and management.\n\nSince IMU Tokens serve multiple utilities on the platform, the Tokens are likely to be in high demand as soon as imusify reaches mass adoption. IMU can be converted to most crypto exchanges including NEO, BTC, ETH. With a limited supply of 1,000,000,000, the imusify cryptocurrency will become scarce in the future. We can further imagine that IMU Tokens will serve new functions once imusify introduces new features.",

            "text": "\ud83c\udf19 Mooncoins (MNC): A Moonshot with Real\u00a0Utility\n\n*Deflationary coin with tokenomics designed for rapid growth and with sustainability achieved through utility.*\n\nPresale Countdown: [https://countingdownto.com/?c=3548882](https://countingdownto.com/?c=3548882)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Today is the day we take-off! \ud83c\udf16 17:00 UTC \\[17th April (Saturday)\\]\u23f0\n\n**The Mooncoin Vision**\n\nThe aim of [Mooncoin](https://moonwallet.org/) is no different from the original vision for blockchain and cryptocurrency: to provide a trustless, permissionless, fully decentralised, non-custodial store-of-value that can be transferred, traded, and transacted without the need for any intermediaries; To eliminate the intercession of any centralised authority; To ensure that this store of value is fundamentally protected from concerns such as inflation, achieved by placing hard limits on supply via provable mathematical algorithms.\n\nMooncoin aims to expand on these goals but in rather a modern way, building on top of more recent innovations in the cryptocurrency space. Mooncoin will provide a store-of-value that takes these principles yet further, ensuring that a truly decentralised system for wealth accumulation and spending is made available in a much more grassroots fashion than possible with more traditional cryptocurrencies.\n\n**About The Team?**\n\nThis is a fairly ambitious project for a moonshot/hype coin project but we have an experienced and talented team who have built and scaled tech companies and worked experience in big crypto projects like Polkadot. We also know and have worked with each other outside of the crypto world.\n\nMooncoin for us is a long-term project. It retains a marketing and development fund wallet which will be used to develop Mooncoin and ensure its growth and success. Our singular aim is to turn Mooncoin into a decentralised financial services powerhouse and thus generate enormous wealth for all its holders.\n\n**The Problem**\n\nRugs are almost a daily practice this day, with developer dumping being a common occurrence. As the popularity of the BSC chain grew the low gas fees attracted a lot of new incumbents into this space some of whom are just here to scam people.\n\nFurthermore, despite this rapid growth, these tokenomics have a strong tendency to go through significant \u201cdumping\u201d phases when those who have generated wealth decide to \u201ccash out\u201d on their positions.\n\nWhen the cycle of selling begins, it decimates the TVL of the cryptocurrency and also erodes investor confidence. These events can have the effect of starting an avalanche of investor-flight, killing the currency off entirely.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nMooncoin sets out to solve this by adjusting the tokenomics to more strongly discourage selling while providing utility for holders. The majority of tax (20% of the transaction amount) is derived from sellers. Buying transactions are taxed at half the rate (10%). This tax is split 50\u201350 between redistribution and providing liquidity.\n\nMooncoin adds utility to hodling by adding a payments system. This allows investors to accrue and hold Mooncoin and build wealth, but minimise sell transactions until they actually need to spend it. The spending features of Mooncoin payments are tax-free, encouraging users to take this route as opposed to losing 20% upon \u201cdumping\u201d mooncoin on the market and dropping the TVL and price for holders.\n\n**Mooncoin Ecosystem**\n\nThe Mooncoin Ecosystem has been designed from the ground up to embrace DeFi. It consists of three core financial products:\n\n\u25cf **Mooncoin:** The currency that serves as a deflationary store-of-value\n\n\u25cf **Moonwallet:** A DeFi wallet that locks-in savings and builds wealth through reflection auto-staking\n\n\u25cf **Mooncard:** A tax-free payments system to spend your mooncoin freely and conveniently\n\nWe have plans to provide our Moonwallet as an integration into the Mooncoin website at moonwallet.org and also as a standalone app. Moonwallet will be used to autostake Mooncoins, trade them, to mint and collect NFTs, and to trade and hold other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWe will further work with partners to integrate Moonwallet with other payment systems and providers.\n\n**Mooncoin NFTs**\n\nMooncoin NFTs will allow users to mint NFTs of varying denominations. These NFTs are reversible and can always be unminted, returning 95% of the original Mooncoin tokens consumed in the minting process.\n\nMinting NFTs takes Mooncoins out of circulation, creating added scarcity. A 5% tax is applied for each unmounting operation which has the added effect of permanently burning Mooncoins and increasing scarcity.\n\n**How To Find Out More?**\n\n\ud83d\udd35 Telegram Chat: [https://t.me/MooncoinDeFi](https://t.me/MooncoinDeFi)\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Website: [https://moonwallet.org/](https://moonwallet.org/)\n\n\ud83d\udd4a Twitter: [https://twitter.com/MooncoinDeFi](https://twitter.com/MooncoinDeFi)",

Following the incredible bull run of 2017, this year has been anything but bullish. Some crypto assets have completely failed and have reduced to dust. Others have struggled to keep their heads above water while others have seen this as a perfect year to launch their ideas at the bottom. \n\n Javvy is a Cayman Island registered crypto company who is part way through their Initial Coin Offering (ICO). CEO Brandon Elliott certainly hasn\u2019t let the current market conditions deter his company\u2019s vision as their ICO has already surpassed their soft-cap. With a hard cap of $8 million, it is only a matter of time before this ICO closes. \n\n Javvy has launched an all-in-one crypto experience which includes a universal wallet with a built-in decentralized exchange. It is designed to have quick & easy registration process, and provide a superior user experience for all that download the app. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Javvy](https://preview.redd.it/htcwm6wlqgc21.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d2fbac90ef9f52910ec928001b01bd9a159ca67)\n\n> ***Tremendous strides have been made to advance cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges into the exciting and disruptive industry that it is today. Yet, the desire remains for a user-focused experience to buy, sell, and use cryptocurrencies in a safe, convenient, and reliable application. This is the Javvy Solution.*** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n The Javvy solution provides convenient buy and sell options inside its wallet. Other features include: \n\n*  Supports use of FIAT (national currency) to buy and sell cryptos/tokens \n*  Complies with financial regulations across all regions \n*  ID Verification (when absolutely required) process tailored for ease-of-use \n*  Citizens of over 170 countries will enjoy nearly instant identity verification \n*  Removes the security risk of web-based exchanges \n*  Simplifies the experience of cryptocurrency exchanges ",

BankDex is built on a peer to peer architecture without the involvement from any third party APIs as the latter ones are the points of failure9 10. The underlying technology is a high-speed, fully decentralized and public blockchain platform that possesses Turing complete, autonomous Smart Contracts.\n\n**BankDex protocol**\n\nBankDex overcomes the scalability limits of current blockchain systems with the BankDex protocol that balances the trade-off between throughput and latencies. Thereby, enables the secure validation and confirmation of initial transactions in seconds, in place of minutes or even hours as in regular blockchain transactions. BankDex provides more than million transactions per second and data transaction per 0.1 seconds \u2014 1000 times faster than other decentralized exchanges. New decision consensus algorithm is based on secure data processing and multiple validation.\n\n**BankDex smart contracts**\n\nThe BankDex platform consists of fraud-proof & completely automated smart contracts with powerful business logic. They allow multiple transactions or order matching from multiple users at the same time at a fast rate. Smart contracts are responsible for: the assets storage and trade settlements execution; arbitrage for processing and keeping track of the transaction; wallet to wallet transactions. These contracts ensure easy methods for the creation and exchange of tokens, increasing their tradability and liquidity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ov770ec4lh31.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1473e304fc624cdf00ae4131a1e24d0142ceb86\n\n**Multi-currency E-Wallet**\n\nMulti-currency E-Wallet to support all kind of hardware and software wallets with no need to install various wallets on devices. Just one single BankDex secure wallet to store and transfer lots of cryptocurrencies. Multiple currency wallet facility enables the national currency transfer through compliant gateway operators.\n\nThis is truly a breakthrough achievement. Not only DEX don\u2019t support fiat. There are only several large CEX that do support the conversion to fiat: Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Coinmama, Bitstamp11. Credit/debit cards, as well as bank transfers, are the two most popular payment means on these platforms12. Others exchanges force traders to buy BTC/ETH from a \u2018gateway\u2019 exchange before transferring it to the crypto exchange to trade with. This process takes time as well incurring a fee for the transfer.\n\n**BankDex Gateways**\n\nGateways to allow trading crypto and fiat currencies as long as they are on the BankDex platform. In the initial phase of development, BankDex users could trade US Dollar/Euro along with other 50 cryptocurrency tokens. BankDex provides scalability with the provision to trade more than 500 coins in the future.\n\n**BankDex Interface**\n\nIntuitive one-stop-shop interface to buy, sell, exchange cryptocurrencies and fiat. Our team involved experienced graphic designers and did the best to set up a very user-friendly environment for all users. A wide range of main languages of the world is supported. As a result, all people interested in crypto trading can enter the exchange and easily carry out their business activities without any hitch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xi740qpq5lh31.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2cfcf16e4bb640ced334ae8e9f9b47012303f39\n\n**Near-feeless transactions**\n\nBankDex allows free trading, without any fees for the first 90 days. After the period, it imposes a nominal fee of 0.003USD.\n\n**Free Cancellation**\n\nUsers can cancel all type of orders without any penalties. Feel free to order and cancel whenever you want.\n\n**Unlimited withdrawals**\n\nBankDex decentralised exchange does not set a limit on the number of withdrawals to be carried out.\n\n**No KYC procedure**\n\nBankDex avoids the need for KYC procedure, maintain anonymity and thus preserving the privacy of traders involved in the trade. Also, without KYC you won\u2019t face the complexity of registration on the exchanges. This process takes up to a couple weeks13 as exchanges are unable to keep their new account opening facility open all the time due to the influx of people.\n\n**Account recovery**\n\nIn case of a lost account, BankDex has the built-in provision to enable account recovery to a new device.\n\n**Simulator Exchange**\n\nBankDex includes simulator exchange that helps to improve trading without risking real money.\n\n**Full Transparency**\n\nAll the details of transactions such as the details of the order book, deposits and withdrawal are all stored transparently on the blockchain.\n\n**Margin trading**\n\nBankDex enables margin trading for its users with the help of a protocol that provides the facility through smart contracts.\n\n**How it works**\n\nAlthough the exchange possesses a centralized order matching system, the order settling is carried out in a decentralized way in the Blockchain. Thus, provides protection from front-running by concealing the orders.\n\nThe orders are paired off-chain in a centralized server before being executed on the Blockchain.\n\nThe trade in the exchange is conducted by market makers and market takers.\n\nThe market maker creates an order for exchanging, say, Token A for Token B. The order contains the desired exchange rates along with the expiration time. It is signed with the maker\u2019s private key and submitted to the database for updating. The maker\u2019s account is then verified for sufficient balance and the order is added to the order book.\n\nThe market taker intercepts the order and matches it. The exchange then verifies the taker account for sufficient balance and if found, the signed transactions are updated in the database and added in the order book.\n\nThe actual fund transfer on the blockchain takes place during the order settling phase. After all the dependent and associated trades are mined, the transaction is transferred to the blockchain, where it is mined and contract balances updated to represent the trade.\n\nOnce the transaction has been mined, the makers and takers are able to withdraw their funds.\n\nWebsite : [https://www.bankdex.io/](https://www.bankdex.io/)  \nTwitter : [https://twitter.com/bank\\_dex](https://twitter.com/bank_dex)  \nFacebook : [https://www.facebook.com/bankdex.io](https://www.facebook.com/bankdex.io)  \nTelegram : [https://t.me/BankdexChatOfficial](https://t.me/BankdexChatOfficial)  \nWhitepaper : [https://www.bankdex.io/index.php/white-paper/](https://www.bankdex.io/index.php/white-paper/)  \nTechnical Paper : [https://www.bankdex.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Technical-Paper.pdf](https://www.bankdex.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Technical-Paper.pdf)\n\nBounty0x username : nefsim\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5q4uyxyx5lh31.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=2285b21f05ff975a71314c70bcbf29f23f21c2a3",

PMMSA will make regularly (weekly terms) ETH deposit of revenues to entire ORET Token owners.\n\n**Elevator Pitch**\n\nTheir target to create electric money that will fully be backed by a firm dedicated to the recovery of costly metals such as gold. The firm, PMM South Africa will allocate 45 percent of the net collection to all ORET Token owners. This allocation will be done on weekly terms regularly.\n\n**General Concept**\n\nPMMSA has made the ORET Token (digital asset) raise the needed funds for the acquisition of soil, concessions, and plants for taking out and recovery of the metal. ORET Token is one of the 1st choices in the world of digital money to invest and share the earnings of metal (gold) mining firm. Thanks to the block tech, the entire ORET Token owners receive their profits in ETH on weekly terms. Discovered by a native prospector in 96, PASO YOBAI is an emerging gold wealthy soil located in eastern Paraguay. The village of PASO YOBAI is almost 160 KMs east of the capital city, Asunci\u00f3n.\n\nThe land of the Association APM covers a full of 84 hectares land, that includes exploration concessions of the earlier mentioned soil. APM holds fully of exploration concessions that cover over 850 meters of the costly metal trend and is completely licensed for recovery.\n\nThe first holders of exploration (recovery) concessions done an wider exploration plan and significantly boosted the worth of the land via diamond drilling that returns more than 27 G \u2013 t of gold in 6.5 meters and by delineating a probable mineral deposit holding among 61,250 and 157,500 tons with an AVG of 4 g \u2013 t and 7 g \u2013 t of gold in open pit mine. Drilling to a depth of 150 meters will add 1,322,000 tons an AVG of among 5.5 g \u2013 t and 8 g \u2013t.\n\n**Revenues for holders**\n\n\u2022 Every expenses and taxes are paid.  \n\u2022 All the metal extracted by the corporation every week is sold in $ (US dollars).  \n\u2022 The corporation changes 45% of the paper Net Profits in Crypto assets (ETH) for allocation among all ORET tokens controllers.  \n\u2022 In order for ORET Token owners to obtain their profits, their ORETs have to be stored in an ERC-20 well-suited wallet that they have the personal key to.

This in itself may appear to be rather obvious to many that they could indeed interact like this but Plaza Systems are planning on using the power of the blockchain to help further the cause in new and innovative ways.\n\n**THE PLAZA ECOSYSTEM**\n\nThe Plaza ecosystem will be built to be scalable and decentralised to ensure stability and sustainability in the long term. The ecosystem will involve the following participants: foundation, platform, sellers, consumers, arbitrators, miners and chatbots. Each participant will interact with others as shown\n\nThe Plaza ecosystem is created through the intelligent integration of established and emerging technologies.\n\nPlazaMarket leveraging the AI powered metasearch engine does  the \u201cshopping\u201d for you by looking up best deals and allows you place  orders easily. There is also provisioning for you to make your purchase  using crypto coins as well as fiat currencies.\n\nIn a nutshell, PlazaMarket is one-stop hub for all ecommerce needs.  On the other, user-privacy is top-notch as there will be sort of  encryption that keeps users\u2019 data away from monopoly of ecommerce sites.\n\nDual Cryptocurrencies fuel the Plaza Ecosystem: The \"master\" PLAZA token will serve as the driver of the Plaza Ecosystem. It is a reusable ERC20 token that is freely transferable on the Ethereum blockchain and can be held within the Plaza integrated wallet or any ERC20 compatible wallet, at the discretion of the user. However, to synchronise the Plaza Ecosystem globally, stabilise prices, and create cross-market e-commerce compatibility, Plaza will issue a stable, fiat-backed cryptocoin, the PlazaDollar (PL$), to be used exclusively for Plaza marketplace transactions.\n\nCheck out more details about the project on their website.\n\n[https://plaza.systems](https://plaza.systems)\n\nBounty0x username: ibrash600",

            "text": "**5 Simple ways how you can prevent being scammed in Crypto!**\n\nWe probably all have been there: investing your money and finding out you have been scammed. Either you instantly lost your investment right after the launch or after a little bit of time. The website looked good, the team was active, advertising on multiple platforms, but still your money is gone.\n\nJust ask yourself how many scams you have seen in your last 15 investments. How much did you money lose? What about other members in your Telegram group? 10.000 or even more people are scammed on daily basis.\n\nWhat if you could prevent a scam and make sure your investments are safe and bring that desired return on investment?\n\nThis is the first of a series of educational articles to help you as an investor to prevent scams or rug pulls.\n\nPlease follow [Hoodrat.Finance](https://hoodrat.finance/) to secure your investment and of course leave an upvote and/or a comment. This motivates us to provide more information and details to secure your investments.\n\nThese are 5 red flags helping you from being scammed\n\n**1. THE INFLATED DEV WALLET.** Be very careful with investing when a dev wallet has over 2% of the supply. This allows the team to dump and take the whole liquidity.\n\n**2. BURNS**. A lot of investors are keen on token burns with the idea that it helps increasing the value and their investment as a result. If 50-75% of the token supply has been burnt and there is a wallet holding 2% (you can easily check this on Binance Smart Chain \u2013 BSC), it means that they actually own 4-6% of the remaining supply. This should always warn you.\n\n**3. AMAZING MARKETING**. All token owners promise amazing marketing and share with you some huge number of followers. Make sure to verify if there is real activity on those upvotes, followers or Telegram members. One of the easiest methods of making something bigger then it is, is to simply buy upvotes and members (bots) at a very low cost. It may provide you with a comfortable feeling about the numbers, but if you do not check for legit conversations the chances are high that it is an army of bots.\n\n**4. THE SO CALLED HONEY-POT.** A honeypot in where the developers have programmed a contract on purpose to not allow investors to remove their investment/profit. You can check if something is a honeypot by looking if there are any sales in the chart (red candles). Additionally you can buy a few dollars initially as a tester and see if you can sell it prior to investing a higher amount.\n\n**5. RENOUNCED OWNERSHIP**. Ownership renounced means the development team doesn\u2019t hold large amounts of tokens. Effectively it means that when ownership is not renounced the team could wait until the public buys a lot then sell their large amount of tokens. This way they take the entire liquidity pool and crashing the price to 0. As a result investors lose all of their money. Renounced ownership can be verified relatively simple. You can do this by checking BSC Scan, click on contract > contract owner. If it states a wallet that starts with 0x0000 it's a burn wallet.\n\nIn the next Reddit post more information will be shared about a $15 million heist and several other red flags when investing in crypto, so stay tuned. Make sure to follow [HoodRat.Finance](https://hoodrat.finance/) and secure your investments\n\n**About HoodRat**: Hoodrat is utility token. The team is building an anti-rug screening tool based on Machine Learning, which the entire crypto community can use to quickly audit risks of any BSC smart contract and pay for that service with Hoodrat tokens.

They combined the crowdfunding components of GoFundMe with the social aspects of Facebook and Instagram on a blockchain.

Donate your tokens, cash or withdrawal and spend how you want.\n\nMulti Wallet Token\n\nWatchUGot\u00a0takes a simple, user-friendly approach to integrating conventional Ethereum wallets. As users earn WUG, RIVAL and token-badges they\u2019re stored in a secure, blockchain wallet and accessed from the My Wallets tab \uf0e0 (user\u2019s) Account page. The streamlined approach allows users to automatically generate unique token wallet addresses upon registration-verification, then access features enabling; management, storage, purchasing and token exchange.\n\nNon Fungible Token\n\nFungibility refers to the value of a token being equal and interchangeable for use in settlements (similar to cash). WUG and RIVL tokens are fungible and conform to ERC-20 & ERC-223 protocol standards respectively and offer basic transfer and voting functionalities. ERC\u201320 tokens are Ethereum based and the standard protocol for a majority of ICOs. This\nproposed implementation allows for WUG and RIVL tokens to act as the platforms native currency and interact with the ERC-721 tokens associated to unique, transferrable, virtual items.\n\nThe Token\n\nThe Ethereum (ERC-20) WUG token is the official coin for use with the WatchUGot store and game environment. WUG is the primary, native currency for virtual and physical items exchanged on the WatchUGot application. It is also the exclusive currency for donations made toward charitable causes and the only token redeemable for cash-value. WUG was designed with the intent to enhance the user\u2019s experience by providing meaningful value and rewarding users for active participation. Eligible users are able to purchase WUG and RIVL tokens directly from the WatchUGot store or receive them as rewards for task completion and community activity participation. Users may choose to exchange their tokens for cash-value, crypto, virtual/physical goods in our store, or donate them directly to charitable foundations.\n\nhttps://watchugot.online\n",

            "text": "Today many people around the world make use of exchanges to invest and trade on daily basis. The two types of exchanges the are been operated now are distributed exchanges and centralized exchanges. This two exchanges have their own pros and cons. The distributed exchange is an exchange which is based on the distributed ledger technology. This distribution ledger technology make it run on its own without the help of people to either service or maintain its operations. Users of distributed exchange funds or tokens are safe because the exchange does not have access to it. In this type of exchange traders from every part of the world trade with each other and the exchange underlying technology guarantee each trade to go through on its own , cleared and settled correctly. Example of distributed exchanges are EtherDelta and BitShare. And in distributed exchange is a very secure exchange when it come to users fund and tokens. Also the cost of transaction is always very cheap and affordable. But the problem of distributed exchange are matching speed , terms of liquidity and flexibility. Also the centralized exchanges are expensive in terms of transactions cost and very slow in terms of deposit and withdrawals. This is why Daex bring a platform that will solve all this problem with new technology and mechanisms. Daex will be a crypto currency clearing service that will be based on distributed ledger technology. They will also have a wallet that millions of mobile devices ( android and iOS ) users around the world can easily make use of to store their digital assets.\n\nDAEX is a solution for the clearing ecosystem to trade crypto currencies. The goal of DAEX itself is to create better infrastructure in the crypto currency industry. ",

This does provide a far more secure marketplace, and by using a digital currency there is also no need to worry about differences in currency values at the point of purchase since everyone is working from the same base.\n\nAlso, the speed of transactions will also be impressive as the blockchain is known for being able to complete a large number of transactions at the one time, so this will generally lead to a more stable market that is easy to browse.

Profits are redistributed to the community through VTX, the local currency that is required to use any of the volentix decentralized applications.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough organization and governance will be distributed among members of the volentix community, the first development is supported by companies within the Volentix Development Network. Currently, these companies are Volentix Labs in Canada, Pythagorean systems in Greece and semantic labs in Bulgaria. More partners will be invited to participate in the Volentix development network to ensure maximum infrastructure development as a whole for the volentix community.\n\n \n\nThe core values of Volentix \u2014 the guiding principles that inform all decisions \u2014 are the following:\n\n* Decentralization of Governance\n* Decentralization of Profit\n* Open Source\n* Personal Privacy and Security\n* Community Transparency\n\nThe goals for distributing VTX are:\n\n* Adding population to the Volentix ecosystem\n* Increasing the value of VTX\n\n The Volentix Pillars consist\u00a0of:\n\nVDex\n\nThe next generation, expandable, customizable, decentralized currency exchange platform, called VDex, will first prioritize the financial and data security of its users (without the knowledge or presence of users). Instead of investing in a central Stock Exchange to trade, VDex users will always keep custody of their funds in their virtual wallet.\n\nVerto\n\nVerto is a multi currency wallet that allows access to Vdex. Private keys are stored in this wallet and are only accessible to the owner, so they prevent hackers from accessing another swap. When a transaction is made in Vdex, funds are temporarily locked until the transaction is completed and new funds are available or the transaction is cancelled and the funds are released again.\n\nVespucci\n\nSince Vdex is a non-central stock market, new currencies can be freely listed. To prevent the trading of worthless, non-existent or even dangerous crypto currencies, Vespucci protects and informs users by providing ratings and rankings for each currency. For this purpose, a comprehensive metric set of social, technological and market data is produced using mined, deep learning algorithms and artificial intelligence. These metrics are visualized as widgets that can be embedded in any site that requests transparent analysis of crypto currencies. The same criteria are used to sort all currencies to enable users to make more informed decisions.\n\nplace\n\nWith venue, anyone can win VTX for ventures that are compatible with the volentix deployment targets. Members of the volentix Development Network will send Awards and campaigns to venue for the jobs they need (for example, to correct errors, to create content, or to promote volentix), and anyone can request a reward in exchange for their efforts. Venue users will soon be able to compete with each other in a signature marketing campaign where a total VTX token pot will be distributed to the participants based on the number of forum posts displaying a volentix signature.\n\nMembers of the volentix community will also be able to offer to Dao via the site to be financed by VTX, if approved. The approval process requires the DAO to forward its proposals to a third party that will work for compliance with the core values and distribution objectives, and then return the third party's Research Findings To The DAO. If the findings of such a research are appropriate, the proposal will be submitted to the community for voting.\n\n \n\n[Website](https://volentix.io/)\n\n[Whitepaper](https://volentix.io/documentation/vdex-whitepaper/)\n\nBounty0x username : slimmm1",

Hence creating the much needed liquidity lacking in the present day DEX exchanges.\n\n\nAlso, as noted from the QUANTA white paper; https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fZZfydUyV_HqHdrMGxGf-ldj8NBrHQkz/view the Quanta DEX would be using a DUAL-LEDGER BYZANTINE FAULT TOLERANT CONSENSUS (DLBFT) and ON-CHAIN ORDER BOOK plus DISTRIBUTED MEMORY POOL which would help augment speed so much as to boost number of transactions from the average 25 tx per sec to over 5million tx per second.",

They function as verifiable proofs of authenticity and ownership within a blockchain network. NFTs are not interchangeable with each other and introduce scarcity to the digital world.\n\n2. What is Binance NFT Marketplace?\n\nBinance NFT Marketplace brings together artists, creators, and crypto enthusiasts on a single platform to create and trade top NFTs. The platform features 3 product lines:\n\n\u2022 Events: Buy premium and exclusive NFTs created by global leading artists.\n\n\u2022 Marketplace: Mint, purchase, and bid on NFTs from creators around the world.\n\n\u2022 Mystery Box: Stand a chance to win rare NFTs in a box full of surprises.\n\n3. How do create an NFT?\n\nClick [Create] and choose your file to upload. We currently support JPG, PNG, GIF, PDF, MP4, MP3, MPEG, AVI, WAV, and SVG. Please note that your NFT cannot be changed or revised once created. To create a revised/new NFT, you will have to start the process again.\n\n4. How do buy an NFT?\n\nFor NFTs with a fixed price, click the [Buy] button on the product page and complete the transaction. Once the transaction is successful, we will transfer the NFT to your wallet and the seller will receive the funds. For NFTs on auction, click [Make an offer], place your bid price, and confirm the offer. In the event of someone placing a higher bid than you, your funds will be unlocked. To join the auction again, you\u2019ll have to place a new bid.\n\n5. How do sell an NFT?\n\nTo list an NFT for sale, our team will first of all approve the content to make sure it\u2019s appropriate for listing. This process usually takes 4-8 hours. Upon successful approval, your NFT will list immediately on the Marketplace as either an auction or fixed price sale, according to your preference. Alternatively, you can also choose to list your NFT at a fixed time (with a minimum of 12 hours after approval).",

            "text": "1. Your Decentralized Option A decentralized exchange represents a marketplace which does not rely on a third-party service to hold the customer\u2019s funds. Instead, trades occur directly between users (peer-to-peer) through a semi-automated process. This supports a high level of security because of an absence of a central server, and provides anonymity & low fees; independent of country of registration.\n\n2. Unique Security Advantages: Following a wave of phishing, malware and cyber attacks on prominent exchanges, safety is the first thing on every traders mind and rightly so. Decentralized exchanges inherently include heightened security. Massive security attacks, such as the roughly $470 million that was stolen from Mt. Gox, were only possible because the centralized hot wallets of the exchange were targeted, which presented a single point of failure. In a decentralized exchange, each user is in private control of their own funds, so there is no central point of attack.\n\n3. Free Listing For The Collective\u2019s Clients:\nOne of the biggest issues faced by new companies in the space is finding a good quality listing. Top exchanges charge exorbitant listing fee and take months to list leaving many projects with no active secondary market. CDEX exchange will provide an avenue for promising companies who pass our due diligence process to be listed at no charge. Our aim is to provide our community access to some of the best companies available.\n\n4. The CDEXTrading Process:\na. A user creates a new order by choosing an ERC-20 token, the amount, the ETH amount in return, and whether it\u2019s a buy or sell order. \nb. Our system creates a secure cryptographic hash of that order. \nc. Our system utilizes a user's Ethereum private key to sign the order hash. \nd. Our system sends the full verified order off chain to await a trade. \ne. When someone wants to trade against the order, the order information is processed through a smart contract. \nf. The smart contract verifies the validity of the order's origin. \ng. The smart contract also makes sure the order is not expired or filled. \nh. Funds are transferred. \n\n5. Supported Wallets:\nDue to the decentralized nature of CDEX exchange, the users don\u2019t need to log on to the website or deposit funds with the exchange. CDEX will support all major wallets including MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, Ledger and MyCrypto. The users can stay in control of their funds without the need to store any private key on CDEX Servers.\n\nhttps://thecollective.io\nBounty0x Username: Osoname",

            "text": "Amateurs like me in the market who are finding ways to establish themselves in the crypto world after getting a taste of trading, are going towards easy mining.\n\nI use the term \"easy mining\" as it is convenient and relatively safe as compared to the traditional ways of mining which either require setting up capital intensive mining systems or getting into mining contracts with the mining companies sharing their computing power. This mining can be done on your home PCs and/or your mobiles and other devices like smart TVs (Yes I said TVs and now I am saying Smart Mirrors too, I have seen it)\n\nI would later describe why it is relatively safe but first I am going to tell you how my brother and few others in the family and friends lost money/faith. They bought mining contracts with GainBitCoin with promising returns. The early loaders were able to earn handsome amount and they brought in more people and this second wave of investors were the one who were exposed to huge risks. These people had less or nearly no technical knowledge of crypto or block chain, forget the mining. They were lured by the high returns that first batch people earned. They were promised monthly returns on their investments in the mining. \n\nInitially the returns were in BTC and then the company launched its own token MCAP and started giving them the tokens for mining payout. For just few months, the tokens were converted and then suddenly they stopped everything and gave everyone tokens to fulfill the contract terms. Now, everyone has that token which as per the company is valued at $15 and can be traded at their own exchange but there are no buyers. At C-cex exchange they are trading at $1.4 but buyers are not there. The guy they say is now in Dubai. God bless him.\n\nRead more on this : https://factordaily.com/amit-bhardwaj-gainbitcoin-mcap-ethereum/\n\nThis is just one of the many working on duping people of their hard earned money in the name of quick bucks. Investors are at fault but the poor legal system/government framework is not strong enough to deal with these. On top of this, India has not yet recognized Crypto currencies meaning they don't have any status of currency, assets. However, they are not illegal even.\n\nPeople started buying from Unocoin/Zebpay wallets and their buy sell difference was over 15% at any given point of time. You buy from them at 10K and sell them at 8K. Then enters Koinex and Coindelta, they were transparent (a lot than the wallets) and started trading various coins and were showing their order book openly. People started migrating from Zebpay and Unocoin to these exchanges and trading started to pick up. Now there are claims that their accounts are frozen by the banks due to various irregularities. Withdrawls and deposits were stopped for few days which initially was fine with the customers however, the extended days started worrying them. These crypto to fiat transactions are still under the cloud of regulations/policies which are not very clear and put the investors at further risk of losing.\n\nEasy Mining options:\n\nHadron.cloud - Hadron is a company which has touched upon the futuristic usage of the crypto technology by bringing in Artificial Intelligence. Terminators are not here yet but Hadron system is based on Artificial Neural Networks which work on the concept of Biological Neural Networks (google for more). In simple terms, the systems are designed to learn as they process more information. Rather than setting up the systems centrally, they have decentralized the mining/computing resources and are allowing people to mine/compute using web browsers on their PCs, mobile phone, tablets, etc.... and yeah smart mirrors too. \n\nHadron says that the idle power wasted in these devices could be put to good use. I got in their alpha testing and have done test mining. The system is smooth and responsive. Off-course I cannot compare this with any other mining as I haven't done or seen any yet but my assessment is based on the convenience, mobility and testing. \n\nMining is based on proof of work, with the major difference being the winner takes all approach is replaced with rewards that are distributed to everyone in ratio of their contribution to the mining. This means everyone can earn and your earning depends on your computation contribution. Phone and PC doesn't heat up during the process and I have done this for 14 hours straight with no errors. Hadron's whitepaper claims that iphone X, Huawei Mate 10 and Pixel 2 have embedded \"Neural chips\" so they ideally they should be able to do this faster.\n\nHadron claims that there technology is beneficial for the society when employed as it could help in early detection of diseases which could ultimately assist in improving the quality of life. Now we are talking some real purpose of a Blockchain. Now the next question is sustainability of the platform and real world usage - Who are the buyers and how are they going to use Hadron. \n\nRead on the \"Real world Usage\" here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2803699.msg28673541#msg28673541 \n\nWell, it seems that Hadron definitely has a strong and bright future.\n**\n\nPhoneum:\n\nPhoneum is a mobile only crypto currency aiming to target the e-commerce. which lets you mine using your mobile device. Phoneum is a cryptocurrency with 1.5% transaction fees (this might change in the final app) and the transactions are superfast. You click it and it's done. I have been using & mining on their testing app from Google play store and have sent Phoneum coins to other test users in the group to see the result instantly. Mining is done only using their mobile phone apps available on Google play store (testing app) and on Apple App store (test app to be launched on 14 feb). \n\nPhoneum claims that any mobile device on the planet can be used for mining and their technology is scalable and fast. For phone users who are worried about battery drain/damage, phoneum app claims to have a feature which monitors the phone temperature. If the temperature gets high the transactions are stopped until cool off to prevent any damage to battery or the phone. During this time the person still earns mining share as they are awarded for their time spent on the app.\n\nThe mining on Phoneum is based on Proof of Work and Proof of time. They are testing the app and are taking feedback for improvements. Phoneum founder claims to be working on a unique algorithm to block out computers and ASIC miners so that the platform is not abused by the high powered devices. The rewards are distributed equally for all mobiles on the network. The app is expected to be launched in April.\n**\n\nImportant thing to note is that both the platforms are eyeing general users for widespread adoption. This would ensure that the user base grows and improves the success of the platforms. This is a good way to cover up the die down aspect when people drop out of the platforms and not enough users are left to keep the platform/token/network running. \n\nAdditionally, by not employing high powered mining devices Hadron and Phoneum are also bringing Green Climate Friendly technologies for the people.\n\nAlthough both Hadron and Phoneum have different utility, they definitely look to resolve many shortcomings of the cryptos we store in our wallets today ! \n\n",

This is a result of media hype and media coverage of the crypto market, as well as its unregulated nature that has allowed vast participation by even the most uninformed of retail investors.\n\nThis is not surprising as the crypto market far outpaced other markets by staggering amounts. Some cryptocoins gained as much as 20,000% between 2016 and 2017.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE PROBLEM**\n\nThe lure of quick and supposedly easy money has not only caught the attention of genuine companies and investors in this space, but has also attracted nefarious entities who want to grab a share of this market. With no regulation to check what is coming into this market as an investment product, a lot of scams have taken over. This poses a real problem in the crypto exchanges and the market at large.\n\nWe now have a situation where many scam crypto exchanges are mostly common, and the majority of crypto investors are afraid, unsophisticated investors without the knowledge of how to decipher the scam crypto investments from the real ones.\n\nLack of regulation in the market and exchanges has also created a situation where there is no trust entity to validate the thousands of new cryptocurrency-based products that are entering the marketplace on a daily basis.\n\nTrusted and accurate information channels that can serve as valid sources of informative and educational content for the unsophisticated, retail investors are lacking.\n\nWhat is the end result? Many cryptocurrency traders have lost and are still losing money in the crypto market.\n\nHigh transaction fee after a successful trading is another challenge on the cryptocurrency exchanges, lack of security, liquidity, and so on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE SOLUTION**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2s6ukklrcb621.jpg?width=528&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=daea9e56088e342ceaf857ed0eff8033ccb25b94\n\nBy using the new design concept and leading technology to utilize the Bitcoin Air\u2019s unique Air Protocol technology, users can choose to off chain the value of their Bitcoin Air, immediately locking in the USD value. The off chaining capability will preserve the USD value of any burned coins in USDAP (USD Air Protocol) through a bilaterally operating side chain that will gain its supply through the action of off chaining your Bitcoin Air to USDAP. What this implies in essence is that, it maintains peace of mind, knowing that the value of your Bitcoin Air is securely guarded by the Air Protocol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE MISSION OF BITCOIN AIR**\n\nBitcoin Air\u2019s mission is to design and produce the first viable attempt at tackling the key issues associated with cryptocurrency, small business and environmental risks at hand today. By producing the first Carbon Credit Asset-Backed Dual-Chain Blockchain, Bitcoin Air leads the way in pioneering the adoptability, scalability, and overall benefits of using the Blockchain. By combining this technology with Green Initiatives and a viable means of Asset-Backing, Bitcoin Air creates the first Living Ecosystem dedicated to reducing the Human Footprint, lowering the cost of living, and increasing the overall quality of life.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6zktiuwtcb621.jpg?width=1123&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=240ab22e1d5e2539b7a259c13e38c31db627cdd6\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EXPLAINING HOW THE BITCOIN AIR PLATFORM WORKS**\n\nBitcoin Air is a bilateral dual-chain blockchain developed to deliver a means of indirect carbon emission reductions through decentralized, trust-less merchant or consumer interactions. Bitcoin Air plans to reduce carbon emissions through the development of a dual chain volatile/stable coin pair dedicated to creating the most versatile and scalable solution for merchant and consumer use. Merchants will be able to transact in cryptocurrency without the worry of profit loss due to fraud or technical issues within their conventional credit card processing equipment. Consumers will be able to transact in a multitude of ways including in person, over the web, or via AirCash Physical Currency!\n\nThe technology behind the Air Protocol was based on the idea of an off chain decentralized reserves system that could maintain the end value of a merchants earnings. Since the analysis of cryptocurrency shows that volatility has come to be the largest issue which is largely caused by market manipulation and in hand aided by low adoption, no regulation, and failed attempts at reserve systems. Bitcoin Air will defeat all of these issues by ultimately providing both a decentralized payment system and a decentralized reserves system that can operate 100% trust free and decentralized from any central power.\n\nThe storage of Air Protocol will be on a privacy focused side chain that will allow open access to your ledger. This in turn means that access to your ledger of mints/burns will be at your control at all times. Publicly permitted API\u2019s will be developed to allow for even the most common bookkeeping and accounting softwares to integrate with your private ledger. The act of reentry into the market will be as simple as *on chaining* your USDAP to Bitcoin Air. This event will occur through the burning of USDAP and the minting of Bitcoin Air at the current market rate. This action, called on chaining, will cause a rise in circulating supply, along with a rise in market capitalization to make sure no other holder takes a negative impact by reentry to the market. Simultaneously, the burning of USDAP will lower the circulating supply and lower the reserves available on the static value side chain.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01ibbyixcb621.jpg?width=789&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76c96950a2148922714a46acb51136199df7d6b5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE MARKET POTENTIAL OF BITCOIN AIR**\n\nBitcoin Air hopes to create the balance that will open the doors for mass adoption by all small businesses world wide. The current financial impact of small businesses on the United States GDP alone is 46%, that would put the potential market at upwards of $8.5 Trillion according to the current United States GDP. To think mass worldwide adoption would put that current number to shame, but to start small and possible, even 1% of that current market flooding to Bitcoin Air through ease of access would mean a market capitalization of $85 Billion. Bitcoin Air seeks to develop an easy, user- friendly, rapid payment system that is accessible and secure enough for everyday use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE UP AND COMING FORK OF BITCOIN AIR**\n\nThe official Bitcoin Air fork date will be announced at a later date as highlighted in the pre-fork road map (view the diagram under roadmap). The overall fork will take place by utilizing three different blockchains and in the end result creating two bilaterally operating blockchains.\n\nThe Peercoin Blockchain is what the entire development of this project will begin on, during this time, the Bitcoin UTXO will be added along with several core features including Lightning Network, Segregated Witness, and Atomic Swaps.\n\nUpon successful finalization of the first blockchain test fork, the Haven Protocol will be forked to create a new off-chain DPoS reserves system dedicated to holding static value without being effected by the volatile states of the market.\n\nThe Peercoin supply will not be added into the fork and this means that purchasing Peercoin will not get you Bitcoin Air during the snapshot. The only users receiving Bitcoin Air at the time of the fork will be holders of Haven Protocol (XHV) and Bitcoin (BTC) at a ratio of 1XHV:(XHV x Current Price of 1 XHV)AIR and 7.5BTC:1AIR. This in turn will put the circulating supply around 2,500,000 AIR to begin, and no cap on the max supply to be open for minting and burning based on the Air Protocol usage. Holders of Haven Protocol will receive USDAP that can be minted into Bitcoin Air at current market value at any time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jm6g5bi0db621.jpg?width=1038&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2025429a31bdbcee2e5e808b9bfffe3f6bb9a07e\n\nThis process will create new Bitcoin Air to create a private way for Haven Protocol holders to receive their Bitcoin without a need to expose their Private Keys to a public blockchain. This process would initially put our supply overall at around 5,000,000 AIR after the final holder of USDAP burns their USDAP and mints AIR on the side chain. At a later fork date, there will be additions to the Air Protocol including the ability to mint/burn into your local currency rate (EURAP, AUDAP, GBPAP, etc.) and mint to same value in AIR when needed.\n\n## \n\n## BITCOIN AIR PRE-FORK ROAD MAP\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g0v39352db621.jpg?width=1031&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41ec3beec769f1257114a908e42690562a80ff7f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yu1491d4db621.jpg?width=1030&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46e83f38a14ee615f9fe93ed37f2b0407caa5026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nBeyond the basic abilities, Bitcoin Air plans to be the first to implement \u201cAir Cash\u201d. Bitcoin Air will have the ability to mint off chain and make sure value is maintained as the team  plan to expand upon this idea extensively beginning with the ability to off-chain your Bitcoin Air to USDAP Air Cash. You will be provided a QR code to print out that can be handed over like real cash and swept into a Bitcoin Air wallet as Bitcoin Air. During this process, creating the Air Cash will burn circulating supply from Bitcoin Air, and mint equal USDAP on the side chain. This will in turn provide a randomly generated private key to the QR code that will hold the value of the USDAP. This balance will not be available in your wallet, and will instead be pegged to this piece of paper. The user can then hand it to a merchant to conduct a purchase, or hand it to any other party to conduct a in person trade. Upon the receiver sweeping the balance to their wallet, the private key and public address will be added to their wallet for usage permanently from then on. The paper document would then become useless, and the address can be disposed of along with the document. This will be the first approach to a fiat introduction for cryptocurrency.\n\n***Team is actively involved in this project and superb, Be part of this Revolution Now!***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h0zvdwo7db621.jpg?width=1017&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bb88e2f4af59efed4a97a3dc4d3bdbf18fea72c\n\nGet connected anytime with the Project using the links below for more information, updates and participation:\n\nWEBSITE: [https://bitcoinair.org/](https://bitcoinair.org/)\n\nWHITEPAPER: [https://bitcoinair.org/wp-content/themes/btc\\_air/downloads/ShortPaper.pdf](https://bitcoinair.org/wp-content/themes/btc_air/downloads/ShortPaper.pdf)\n\nANN THREAD: [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5044039.new#new](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5044039.new#new) \n\nDISCORD: [https://discord.gg/KWJUBy](https://discord.gg/KWJUBy)\n\nTWITTER: [https://twitter.com/BitcoinAirUSA](https://twitter.com/BitcoinAirUSA) \n\nGITHUB: [https://www.github.com/BitcoinAir](https://www.github.com/BitcoinAir)\n\nREDDIT: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinAir/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinAir/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1u5mzorfdb621.jpg?width=881&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26f1738987c1b0d5ae3c25faf392039e67bcde68\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WRITER'S DETAILS**\n\nBitcoinTalk Username: ***cryptoblezin***\n\nBitcoinTalk Profile URL: [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2178561;sa=summary](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2178561;sa=summary)\n\nETH Address: **0xC89b8Dd7e3E137DB108575EeAe301E52b6C72d9F**",

            "text": "So what's the difference between [Hot and Cold Wallets?](https://blog.kucoin.com/paper-wallet-crypto-sk-rd) Well to distinct things simply, Hot Storage or Hot Wallet is like the wallet that is carried around in pocket. Hot storage, in simple terms, is where cryptocurrency is kept in a device which is directly connected to the internet. This connection is what makes a device \u201chot\u201d. Think of exchange wallets, desktop clients, and mobile wallets (any wallet that exists on a device that will ever connect to the internet) as a hot wallet. It\u2019s easy to access funds on a hot wallet, and if someone lives somewhere that accepts cryptos for micropayments, there\u2019s nothing wrong with using one for day-to-day spending. Think of it like fiat (government issued) currency. Might wanna walk around with a portion of wealth in a wallet for convenience but the majority is it was kept secured away. Hot wallet should behave in the same way as a real-world wallet.  \n\nOn the other hand, the Cold storage or Cold Wallet is somewhat akin to anyone's savings bank account. It's where currency is kept in a device which is completely offline. For those seeking the most secure form of storage, cold wallets are the way to go. These are best suited to long term storage for crypto funds, who don\u2019t require access to their coins for months, or years at a time. Also, it provides a safety net against hackers and people with malicious intent since it is completely offline.  \n\nThere's no simple answer to this question whether to use Hot Wallet or Cold Wallet. Every cryptocurrency user needs to evaluate their requirements. Likely, if in any case someone is going for long term holding, considering the potential value of a paper wallet, which could create an extremely secure crypto storage can serve a viable long term solution without even paying a thing. Just try and utilize the different kinds of wallets to mitigate risk as much as possible, while maintaining the access for an ease of need.",

This means there is no need to invest into new computers, hardwares, housing, cooling, maintenance or any other operational costs.This will simply lead, eventually, to low Cloud Computing Service for customers since the cost at it's lowest already.\n\n\\- \\*\\*What Will Crypto Traders Get?\\*\\*Since HiveNet has its own coin (HiveCoin) that is used to pay for computing powers within the HiveNet network. Hereby an ongoing demand for HiveCoins is ensured by customers and will create one of the few cryptocurrencies with a real fundamental value & use case, which provides excellent short- mid and long-term opportunities for traders / investors.\n\n\\*\\*\u2022 HiveNet Task Management System (HTMS)\\*\\*The HTMS is the core technology of the HiveNet's decentralized cloud computing network.

This article is dedicated to the Atomic Wallet. In previous reviews, you familiarized yourself with the wallet and its functions. In this article, I want to present you the option of buying a BTC with a credit card in the wallet itself. \n\nVery interesting and functional, in my opinion, a wallet. A simple and intuitive interface that accommodates convenient options for storing and exchanging basic cryptocurrencies and many tokens. At the moment, it supports more than 300+ tokens and periodically adds new coins. The application constantly updates and improves security, for the safe storage of users' crypto active assets.  \nIn more detail, you can familiarize yourself with the project on their official website [https://atomicwallet.io/](https://atomicwallet.io/).  \nThere you can also download the wallet and subscribe to updates, the wallet is available for all major operating systems. At the moment, the latest version of the wallet is 1.39.1. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ztbypt2ptsw21.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=16ba61d3418ca61efe3ddb9b47b10bae3035e76a\n\n \n\nGreat app for storing your assets. According to the developers, the security of your funds is fully protected. Everything is under your control, passwords are stored with you, you can restore the wallet using the mnemonic 12 words that you write down during installation. Read more about this and how it works here [https://atomicwallet.io/what-are-private-keys-and-how-they-work](https://atomicwallet.io/what-are-private-keys-and-how-they-work)\n\nYour safety is completely in your hands. Do not store keys and mnemonic words on the computer.  \nCompliance with decentralization makes this wallet private and I think users will appreciate the development of a team of project professionals.\n\nThis video will help you understand how to buy BTC.\n\n[https://youtu.be/V9Igzp9K37k](https://youtu.be/V9Igzp9K37k)\n\n Cryptocurrency can be bought with a credit card. Consider a purchase, on the example of the card Simplex. Simplex is a company that provides secure payment processing worldwide, with minimal risk and no fraud. The technology of this company has proven itself on the market from the positive side and allows you to process online payments, for users, with great speed and increased conversion of declined transactions. Among the partners of the system are well-known exchanges Binance, Kukoin, and many other companies. In more detail, on the official website [https://www.simplex.com/](https://www.simplex.com/)  \nSimplex ensures that exposure to risk is reduced to zero and is responsible for returns in case of fraud. The project acts as a trusted guarantor of the transaction and makes a confirmation only when all parties report that the transaction was successful. The reputation of the platform can be judged by numerous well-known partners who cooperate with the company Simplex.  \nThe collection of personal information is used to provide exchange services and prevent unauthorized actions. Information of users does not apply to third-party resources, and operates only within the system and is provided to companies that participate in a trade operation. At any time, you can delete your data, for this you need to write in support of the site. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jkninkmutsw21.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ecd2061b23fa2f031f64de0331fa8f5d17457db\n\nWhen you first purchase BTC, you need to go through the verification process (only once). The minimum threshold for acquiring cryptocurrency is $ 50. Credit or debit cards, Visa and MasterCard are accepted.

            "text": "**CMC listing:** https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crowns/\n\nFrom **r/diamondhedge**, DD from **Infamous_Sympathy_91**\n\nMany of you have been waiting ages for my next investment call, and I've worked very hard to make sure I do not disappoint! Feel free to share my DD in any other subreddit or social media platform to raise awareness.\n\n**KEY DETAILS:** CWS/USDT (https://www.seascape.network/)\n\n**24h Trading Volume on MXC:** only 87,603 USDT\n\n**24h Trading Range:** $25-$28.267\n\n**Market Cap:** $26m (Audius was $27m when I first called them, it hit an ATH of $580m)\n\n**Investors:** Binance, LD Capital, Paka, Spark Digital Capital, Nabais Capital, M6, DU Capital, JRR Capital.\n\n**Partners:** Chainlink, Moonbeam, Opensea, Maker, Binance Smart Chain, Matic, Treasureland etc...\n\nI got in at $25 today for $25k so far invested. Seeking price target of $500 (20x on $26m mcap to $520m in less than 8 weeks). Likely they will be listed on Binance around $125m mcap or sooner. It's Alt Season now so they may increase quicker OR ath may be higher OR both. Remember Audius took nearly 4 weeks to double from my 22 cent call then it exploded to $4.99. Price increases are not linear.\n\nRecall, I developed a deep learning assisted bot to search the internet and work out which of these 1000s of silly coins will gain. CWS/USDT also popped up as another prime candidate gaining the traction metrics leading to organic big gains over the next few months. Add in a coordinated HODL at this volume level and you have a 20x-er. Untouched it has reached $50 by itself, **uncorrelated** generally to BTC, so its a prime alt season huge upswing candidate. Technicals also show a quick fib retracement to $50 within the next 2 weeks or sooner with good buying activity. No one was keeping track of what I said with Audius, this time, it may be different?\n\n**Special Considerations:** Becoming the STEAM game distribution platform for DeFi is a much more realistic proposition than becoming a massive AAA-game developer such as the Activision of DeFi, we are years away from seeing anything like that. I've overseen game production in my past and it's a tough business! Delays happen all the time, and its ends up being expensive and taking much longer than anticipated (even if you x2 or x3 your most conservative time length expectations). **Much better to be the picker and chooser of great games**. I also have contacts at Supercell (who made the great Clash of Clans) and I will hook these guys up. I spent the last few days talking to the founder of Seascape and drilled him for information and believe they are on the right track.\n\nLike Audius, this is a coin with a website that the GENERAL PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND with a product that can be used now, granted they only have a few games, they are developing their blockchain to make it very cost effective and scalable for much bigger game titles to use them as their **in-game coin economy** partner, even if they have better distribution than seascape now. Seascape is an **in-game economy technology partner first and foremost. They are doing the hard stuff, unlike Ultra, so that they later this year become the distribution partner of choice for DeFi game titles.** Ultra is just steam with tokens and they are already around $250m market cap right now, so you see, Seascape could blow them out of the water!\n\n**SEE BELOW FOR COMPETITOR ANALYSIS for when Seascape was JUST $528k mcap** at a $10m private investor valuation (when they first listed - they caught up to that private investor valuation within weeks and that was picked up by my crypto bot - very sorry for the few weeks lag, my bot still needs to crunch data, still working out how to find gems right when they first list but that's an extremely hard thing to do!!)\n\nHowever, as with Audius, I hope another 20x is good enough, BUT I picked this up much sooner than Audius after listing so 30x is my hopium target although I don't want to be too bold. I am seeking $750 take profit if this one keeps rising strongly after surpassing $500.\n\nNFTs: 25,000 NFTs minted on BSC and millions of dollars dropped to users through their LP mining game. Increase in its NFT economy alone could add an extra $50m-$100m to its mcap over the next few months.\n\n**Whitepaper:**\n\nhttps://f2be4719-641d-430b-92d5-747132d8c9bd.filesusr.com/ugd/061436_2d3e0cc2c8cc41a0a42e3cc2d57c7e3e.pdf\n\n**Remember:** this is a Reddit post, it is NOT financial advice, dispense your loads where ever you wish after doing your own DD and research and maybe throwing a dart at a wall. YOLO. I'm packing up to Mars. Audius already got us to the Moon! (x20 on x20 is x400).\n\n**Notes:**\n\npCWS is the bridged version of CWS (the currency of Seascape on ETH) on BSC (Binance Smart Chain). Users can bridge from ETH to BSC using poly.network bridge. 1 CWS = 1 pCWS as they are completely interchangeable. Here's a walk-through of Polybridge: https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1\n\n**Investors Verification:**\n\n1. https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-joins-seascape-network-to-take-defi-gaming-to-the-next-level/\n\n2. https://ldcap.com/ (under NFT portfolio companies)\n\n3. https://thecoinmagazine.com/massive-rewards-for-seascape-nft-hodlers-1000-each-to-139-addresses/\n\n4. https://www.sparkdigitalcapital.com/\n\n5. https://www.cypherhunter.com/en/p/seascape/ (Nabais Capital) \n\n6. https://medium.com/seascape-network/nabais-partners-with-the-seascape-network-73bb82be20b2\n\n7. https://jrr.group/\n\n**High number of coins in a few wallets:**\n\nAudius had a similar position where 84% of coins were held in 2 wallets. Seascape's token release schedule is structured to cause growth in their ecosystem and corresponding growth in their price to mitigate future inflation effects. Essentially new games will be backed by newly released CWS acting as collateral for newly minted game coin economies generated on the Seascape blockchain. This means, as a new game grows its user base and its in game economy grows in value, those additionally released CWS should in effect pay for themselves mitigating inflation effects. Interestingly, Audius had a similar reason for releasing new coins, i.e. to attract new artists, and it grew from $27m mcap to an ath of $580m.\n\n**Original post:** https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamondhedge/comments/mmgbd0/seascapenetwork_the_steam_of_defi20x_potential/",

I will give you some real life instances in this article. Enjoy reading! \n\nBlockchains and cryptocurrencies were envisioned as community-oriented open-source initiatives where the participants of a decentralized network have the power instead of a central authority. This has held true with the exception of dev teams that still have a significant say in the project. Often times blockchains have a leader that everyone believes in and follows, limiting the effects of decentralization, however, it is not that big of a deal.\n\nCentralized exchanges are the exact opposite of what has been mentioned above; there is a direct conflict between what they represent and blockchain values. \n\nOn the other hand, a truly decentralized exchange works in a distributed way through a blockchain, with orders and information routed in a peer-to-peer protocol. This way, you are entrusting a system of hundreds of independent nodes instead of a single centralized entity, like an exchange. \n\nCrypto exchanges have emerged the tool to profit from crypto asset ownership but they are far from being without their pitfalls. Majority of crypto exchanges are a single point of failure with lots of issues that traders experience on them among which are high transaction fee and withdrawal fee, lack of security, liquidity problem, lack of trust, unreliable and many more. Deex is a revolution to the crypto world where trading is concerned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6taladob9b621.jpg?width=1262&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce1202169e6a48d39d530878fb4bd74ffff4648b\n\nOn 26th of October year 2017, the presale of Deex tokens started. During the presale, team planed to raise funds in the amount of around $ 3,000,000 which then will be spent for Deex cryptocurrency exchange prototype MVP development, marketing and advertisement campaign for ICO.\n\nDeex exchange already listed some coins / tokens on the platform which of course are mostly popular cryptocurrency wallets and a trading capability of cryptocurrency pairs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# SOME SPECIAL FEATURES OF DEEX THAT MAKES IT STANDOUT FROM THE OTHERS\n\na. Referral rewards program: Stimulates the involvement of new participants by existing participants paying them an appropriate remuneration. The team plan to introduce a multi-level referral system on the Deex Exchange, which will be launch soonest.\n\nb. Transferable Named Accounts: Use of natural words to indicate the account\u2019s name instead of long and non-memorable characters as it is done in the Bitcoin network. Each name is unique, and that excludes any risks of its substitution.\n\nc. Delegated Proof-of-Stake Consensus (DPOS): Very stable and flexible protocol for confirming network blocks. DPOS is the fastest, most flexible and most efficient decentralized consensus model. DPOS uses the right to vote with the participation of stakeholders in resolving issues requiring common consent on a fair and democratic basis. All parameters of the blockchain from the payment schedules to the intervals and size of transactions can be coordinated through the delegates of the delegate community selected by all participants (they confirm the new network blocks). The deterministic choice of Delegates allows you to confirm transactions for a period from 1 to 3 seconds\n\nThe BitShares 2.0 platform allows to implement the following main functional of the Deex Exchange:\n\n* Creation of a secure cryptowallet which allows to transfer funds with a minimum commission for all counterparties;\n* Create an ICO mechanism (primary coin/token placement);\n* Buy and sell cryptocurrencies and tokens; \n* Make investments by buying tokens from prospective companies and participating in the distribution of expected profit; \n* Create your own crypto assets and trade them; \n* Ensure the highest security and reliability of all transactions in the blockchain network through the DPOS algorithm;\n* Use special gateways (Gates) as mechanisms for transferring funds between different trading platforms and payment systems for fiat funds input/output.\n* Create accounts with escrow;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p5ulafhj9b621.jpg?width=517&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60399558c6d092bbe78f9f05a6a3a784853036a0\n\n# WHY DEEX?\n\nThe profit in the Deex ecosystem will be formed from all operations on Deex Exchange (commissions for exchange transactions, for entering and withdrawing funds, and many others). The Deex Exchange will distribute 30% of the quarterly profit among the holders of the Deex.Core token. Deex.Core will be the fuel for the operation of the entire ecosystem.\n\nEvery time a user makes a payment, a commission fee of 0.1% of the transaction amount in the Deex Exchange is debited from his account and burned as a fuel for the transaction. Since all these operations will be displayed in the detachment, this mechanism can be called the most understandable and transparent without any hidden and incomprehensible commissions.\n\nThe possession of Deex.Core tokens creates a reserve which can be used as a fuel for future payments/transactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TEAM OF DEEX EXCHANGE\n\nDeex is led by Vladislav Sapozhnikov, the founder of Preprocessing Ltd and representative of Coinsbank in Russia. Other listed members of the team include Maya Zotova-Hess, Denis Soldatov, Yuri Milyukov, Andrey Girin, Ekaterina Tarasova, and Tatyana Maksimenko.\n\nUseful Official Links of DEEX exchange platform:\n\nWEBSITE: [https://www.deex.exchange/](https://www.deex.exchange/) \n\nWHITEPAPER: [https://www.deex.exchange/docs/DEEX\\_wp-2.0\\_eng.pdf](https://www.deex.exchange/docs/DEEX_wp-2.0_eng.pdf) \n\nTWITTER: [https://twitter.com/deex\\_exchange](https://twitter.com/deex_exchange)\n\nFACEBOOK: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/deex.exchange/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/deex.exchange/)\n\nREDDIT: [https://www.reddit.com/user/the\\_deex](https://www.reddit.com/user/the_deex)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBitcointalk Username: doglasslim\n\nBitcointalk Profile: [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2265600;sa=summary](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2265600;sa=summary)",

You can use this token to pay for goods  and  services on the Polka City platform.\n\nAccording  to the team, before the end of the first quarter of 2021,  the project  will witness DeFi and NFT platform launch. There would also  be public  and private sales for crypto enthusiasts to participate in the  project.  The team also posited that during the second quarter of 2021,  Polka  City will have a mobile app and the second version of its official   website. There would also be a Polka City wallet release, NFT special   edition release, and Referral platform release during the second quarter   of 2021.\n\nFor the referral  platform, as a user of the Polka City platform, you  would be able to  make extra income just by referring your friends or  family members to  also sign up. The details of the referral program and  how much you can  make via the program is still sketchy as of the time of  writing this  post.\n\nThe third and fourth  quarters of 2021 appear to have similar updates.

A minimum required holding is needed and will be revealed in the chat. Reason being, Gas fee is going to kill any reflection in BUSD. This BUSD will be reflected every 30min-1hr.\n\n**What makes a token good?**\n\nI don\u2019t care if you are Doge or VET or any other coins. You need to know and understand the fact that is always 30% Dev and Contract and the other **70% COMES FROM THE COMMUNITY WORKING TOGETHER.**\n\nWe are a bunch of degens that have been in the crypto space for a while, Join the tg group and I swear you will see all the familiar faces there. Amongst the degens, inevitably there are a couple of smart nerds with us, so here we are.\n\nWhat makes us stand apart from other Degens? We are the Diamond Holders for tons of big projects (I can\u2019t name them but join us and you will know), and we have never settle for 5x 10x or such shit it is always all or nothing for us.

After this, the Fees will be added to the Buyback wallet until the Liquidity is out of balance again.\n\n\u00b7 With the Buyback Fee the contract will accumulate BNB to use for a Buyback Event. In this event, the contract will buy Tokens and Burn them afterwards. Sell Fees will be doubled for the duration of 30 minutes to prevent people from dumping.\n\n\u00b7 5% of each transaction is converted into BUSD and sent automatically to the wallets of holders. No more hassle with claim functions!\n\nAnd you think this is the end of it? During the 1st hour, any sell will result in 30% tax per trade. If you don\u2019t understand the reason why.. go back to school.\n\n\\---\n\n\ud83c\udfeaMarketing:\n\nWe will reveal it in TG. Rest assured, we already have influencers ready to deploy.

And this is also\u00a0**beneficial to their respective communities**, potentially allowing them to grow as well.\n\nIn a nutshell:\n\n* [**Bitcoin Meister**](https://bitcoinmeister.eu/?ref=12)\u00a0is the very first \u2018***Digital currency Bank***\u2018 \u2013\u00a0***DcB***\u00a0\u2013 that allows users, amateurs, pros and novices to the world of Cryptocurrencies, to\u00a0***buy Cryptos***,\u00a0***in the simplest way possible***,\u00a0***with FIAT (Fiduciary) Currency such as Euro***,\u00a0***Dollar***, by allowing you to\u00a0***buy Cryptos directly via a bank transfer***. And all this \u2018**Custody Free**\u2018, you don\u2019t take any risk with your assets, and above all you remain the owner of them, all your Crypto are secured in your personal Wallets\n* [**HTMLcoin**](https://htmlcoin.com/)\u00a0&\u00a0[**Althash Blockchain**](https://www.althash.university/home) ***supports all ambitious projects that need Blockchain Technology***. Because Blockchain Technology has its place in any industry, which needs an \u2018element\u2019 of trust, without the need for a third party. As\u00a0[**Vincent Hoffmann**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincent-hoffmann-3376803a/)\u00a0(COO of\u00a0[**HTMLcoin**](https://htmlcoin.com/)\u00a0&\u00a0[**Althash**](https://www.althash.university/home)) says, \u201c***We are looking for people with good skills and abilities, who don\u2019t just \u2018Talk Big\u2019 but are able to \u2018Do Big\u2019, to take concrete actions***\u201c.\u00a0\n\nThe partnership between these two entities is primarily :\u00a0\n\n* [**HTMLcoin**](https://htmlcoin.com/)\u00a0offers a\u00a0**Blockchain solution**\u00a0to\u00a0[**Bitcoin Meister**](https://bitcoinmeister.eu/?ref=12)\u00a0with\u00a0[**Althash Blockchain**](https://www.althash.university/home), which allows\u00a0**transactions to be made at lower costs**\u00a0(i.e. an\u00a0**average of 0.004** [**HTML**](https://explorer.htmlcoin.com/) **\u2018gas\u2019 fee**). \u2013\u00a0*Unlike other Blockchains where fees can range from $20 to over $100!*\n* For its part,\u00a0[**Bitcoin Meister**](https://bitcoinmeister.eu/?ref=12)\u00a0offers the ability to\u00a0**buy and sell** [**HTMLcoin (HTML)**](https://explorer.htmlcoin.com/)\u00a0in a simple and secure way via its\u00a0[**platform**](https://bitcoinmeister.eu/?ref=12).\n\nAnd the second point of this partnership, and not the least, is the\u00a0**development of the NFT Market**\u00a0between\u00a0[**Althash Blockchain**](https://www.althash.university/home)\u00a0&\u00a0[**Bitcoin Meister**](https://bitcoinmeister.eu/?ref=12).\n\n[**Althash Blockchain**](https://www.althash.university/home)\u00a0is able to\u00a0***provide the necessary Smart Contracts for all NFT transactions***, which will make\u00a0[**Bitcoin Meister**](https://bitcoinmeister.eu/?ref=12)\u00a0the very\u00a0**first NFT Trading platform in Europe**.\n\nAs said before, the\u00a0**fees are extremely low**, unlike the platforms that run on the Ethereum Blockchain where users have to pay mind-boggling fees (gas) to buy NFTs.\n\n[**Althash Blockchain**](https://www.althash.university/home)\u00a0has completely redesigned the system to\u00a0**offer the lowest possible fees**. Unlike all other NFT selling platforms, the\u00a0*artistic creations*\u00a0(images, photos, videos ..)\u00a0*are not hosted on the Blockchain*\u00a0(while the fees are calculated on the file size),\u00a0*but on a totally secure external server*, and\u00a0*only the direct link to the NFT is hosted on the Blockchain*. So the lowest possible fees for NFT Minting.\n\n**This will undoubtedly offer more opportunities to artists**, and thus to the\u00a0**popularization of the NFT Market**.

Numerous new organizations are currently chipping away at this innovation, and vast organizations are trying it in shut systems to team up straightforwardly with one another without the requirement for mediators. Therefore, there is a great deal of undertakings that are beginning to utilize this new innovation.\n\nIn any case, not every one of them is justified, besides all the problems. We all need to study quite well, what each task is addressed to, what is its technical description, its certified consultants and much more. As I already mentioned, innovations in blockchain became popular due to public and transparent information about digital forms of money, which surprised many new companies that send their own cryptographic forms of money without even trying to convince them.\n\nThis pattern has risen in light of the fact that new participants have been progressively spry in receiving rising advances contrasted with occupants who are hampered by inheritance frameworks. Be that as it may, this aggressiveness and this favorable position appreciated by the new players might be fleeting, as no economies of scale are considered.

Clients who use KABN remove the headache of building their own application and speed up the compliance process for participants already known to the KABN network. \n\n **Flexible Whitelists**\n\nKABN is designed around the concept of whitelist membership. Whitelists on KABN are architected to support binary yes/no queries to allow or prevent restricted actions such as purchasing cryptotokens. Whitelists on the KABN network have a customizable set of compliance rules. Customers who join the whitelist and satisfy all the compliance rules are allowed to perform restricted actions. When a customer joins a whitelist, the customer is prompted to fill out information and upload copies of personal documents. KABN has the ability to render different web forms to accommodate different whitelist rules. KABN retains history across whitelists to avoid asking for the same information more than oncefrom the same customer. The KABN whitelist architecture accommodates compliance and scale across multiple financial touchpoints while serving individual client needs. \n\n**Always-On** **Compliance**\n\nKABN supports internationally recognized documents for Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. In addition, for issuers of private or early stage assets, KABN provides qualification for investors in the United States and Canada, and source of wealth verification for investors in Europe. To date, KABN has screened individuals in the following countries: Armenia, Australia, Bangladesh, Belarus, Canada, Ecuador, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Latvia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Philippines, Romania, Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America and Vietnam. Other countries will be added as they come on board.Customers on the KABN network receive ongoing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) monitoring and requests to confirm or update personal information that is expired or out of date. Financial technology startups can outsource this operational burden at no extra charge.\n\n**Blockchain Registries**\n\nIssuers of crypto-assets are required to allow or deny participation at the smart contract layer in self-executing code deployed on the blockchain network. KABN provides registry contracts  deployed on blockchain networks that manages and tracks which blockchain wallets are allowed to perform regulated actions. Customers who join a KABN whitelist are required to link at least one blockchain wallet to their account. When a customer is approved, KABN automatically grants access in the corresponding smart contract registry. KABN drives efficiency over existing solutions by allowing any clients who use a KABN blockchain registry integration to configure their whitelist and reference the registry contract in their own smart contract code. KABN provides a complete end-to-end on-chain compliance solution without the need to write any application code.  \n\n**Data Vault**\n\nIn order to provide compliance solutions, some information and documents are sensitive Personally-Identifying Information (PII) which KABN stores in encrypted database and object storage in Ireland in order to be GDPR compliant. Startups and issuers are, in management\u2019s observation, often ill equipped to handle this sensitive data. In many cases, employees at less experienced companies will store customer documents on personal computing devices. KABN shields all clients from handling sensitive data by providing customer-facing applications. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7fgklgbqinx21.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=796a6f44d03b935bd5d8f3c80fad6b72789d8870\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Based on management\u2019s current review \\(subject to change with respect to other companies\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/kzf6oemrinx21.png?width=999&format=png&auto=webp&s=b64162a7ea914fffa956a5d1eae1a818d6f9ae04)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n[Page](https://www.kabntoken.com/?ref=bty21)\n\n[WPaper](https://www.kabntoken.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/KABN-Company-Overview-Summary-V1.2.pdf)\n\nbounty0x: coin31733",

            "text": "  \n\nThere has been a lot of investment in the NFT/Metaverse/P2Espace recently. Many businesses are investing heavily in it, and it continues to grow. I recently learned that Saudi Arabia is considering investing $6.4 billion in the Metaverse, and Grayscale has dubbed the Metaverse a trillion-dollar revenue opportunity. With all of this going on, some developers are turning NFT-based games into cash-grabs, taking advantage of the hype surrounding NFT-based games, and creating games with no good gameplay or graphics whose sole purpose is to make money.\n\nThe majority of them are carbon copies of the Axie infinity concept, which is a game in which players collect, train, and battle digital creatures known as Axies, each of which has unique attributes that make them more or less valuable.\n\nI believe that to have a successful NFT-based game, we need to see more qualified and experienced game developers who can create a game that everyone can enjoy first and attract millions of players to invest in collectibles, art, and other virtual goods on a blockchain-powered gaming platform that runs on reliable technology and provides a seamless gaming experience.\n\nOthers include:\n\nSecurity - Security and the protection of developers and gamers are always the top priorities. For those who are unfamiliar with the blockchain concept, it is designed to be secure. This is always the case, and the implementation and settings have a huge impact on it.\n\nTransparency - In-game purchases are frequently one-time, non-transferable investments tied to a specific gaming environment. Gamers can claim ownership of their in-game assets by using the NFT game platform settings. Gamers can use blockchain technology to save in-game purchases, sell them to other players, and transfer them to other compatible games.\n\nStandardization - By expressing non-fungible assets on public blockchains, developers can create common, reusable, and inheritable standards. Ownership, transfer, and necessary access control are all standard primitives.\n\nImmutability - When a typical online game goes down, users frequently lose all of their in-game purchases. On the other hand, the NFT game website is built on the blockchain and is not tied to any specific gaming platform.\n\nUnfortunately, only free games, including Monster Galaxy, follow this model. A creature taming and combat game backed by 18 years of experience team in the global online anime community and gaming industry\n\nMonster Galaxy P2E is owned by Gaia Club, which has released several successful games, including zOMG and Lake Kindred. The Monster galaxy music Monster Galaxy P2E also shines bright thanks to a stunning soundtrack from Jeremy Soule and the band TREAT. And players will also enjoy an enhanced battle experience and also earn while they play thanks to an exciting new token-based economy!\n\nOther benefits are Players As Owners, Total Transparency, Free Exchange, Economic Returns. Players can earn these in-game tokens and MOGA NFTs by completing quests as well as battling monsters and fellow players and also stake their GGM token on the staking site.\n\nIs it likely that more projects will follow the proper gaming model, or will the cash-grabs craze continue?",

Many rare footballer and artwork assets were auctioned for hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2021, indicating that the market will continue to grow. The best way to profit technically is to invest in NFT and new crypto.\nI believe that customizable nfts for personal use or entertainment, rather than an ai-generated image, will be extremely popular. Only a few projects, such as the NFT avatar maker tool, which is a \"all-in-one\" avatar tool, are available.\n\n\n Users will be able to personalise their Avatars by selecting from a growing library of assets that includes billions of possible combinations and over 1200 unique assets such as Samurai Masks, Superhero Cowls, and Golden Skin.",

Very soon, people will be able to borrow funds and use these unique tokens as their collateral. \n\nYoung kids are making money from NFTs. It won't be a bad idea to introduce your kids to it at an early stage. It will give them the head start amongst their peers. A great way to introduce them is to use NFTs that are related to what they use. For instance, you could mint Anime NFTs from Goku for your kids, especially if they like Anime movies.",

Here are a few of the reasons why I think everyone should check it out.\n\n Because this generation is obsessed with video games, people are known more for their gaming names than their real names if they're interested in NFTs. I believe that metaverse and nfts will have a similar impact.\n\nSo, do you think it'll be financially beneficial? Consider the scenario below: In a video game, you have an NFT avatar. Will its value remain stable? Second, will the game developers put your NFT avatar through its paces with the rest of the game to see if it fits in?\n\n'Play and earn' is a new way to trade NFTS these days, with games allowing users to earn NFTS that can then be traded for a higher price on market places. This trend, I believe, will spread beyond gaming to other industries. Here's how I see things.\n\nI am confident that it will be a huge success. Only a few projects are available, such as the NFT avatar maker tool, which is a \"all-in-one\" avatar tool.\n\n Users will be able to customise their avatars by choosing from a growing library of assets. Samurai Masks, Superhero Cowls, and Golden Skin are just a few of the over 1200 assets available, with billions of possible combinations.",

The funds will be used for product  development, NFT  multi-chain ecosystem expansion, and the exploration of  NFT-Fi and  Metaverse.\n\nDeFine  has also become  one of the first NFT platforms to receive investment  from the Tron  Foundation. As Tron Foundation participates in this  investment as a  strategic partner, the two parties will work together to  develop the  First NFT marketplace in the TRON ecosystem and launch  auctions soon.\n\nEarlier   this month, DeFine and Tron formed a strategic partnership. With the   integration of DeFine on the Tron network, users and creators across the   globe will be able to enjoy the platform without worrying about   transaction speed and fees. Meanwhile, DeFine will explore bringing its   unique NFT-based social profile system to the Tron ecosystem.\n\n**About Tron**\n\nTron   provides an efficient, convenient, reliable, secure, and scalable   blockchain platform to millions of developers worldwide. In March, 2021   it launched the first NFT standard TRC-721 and improved the world\u2019s   largest distributed storage system BTFS, delivering a comprehensive and   efficient infrastructure to convert artworks as NFTs on blockchain.\n\n**About DeFine**\n\nDeFine   is the NFT social platform for all creators including artists,   musicians, influencers, gamers, and athletes. The platform facilitates   all social interaction, engagement and communication for creators and   their fanbase with digital assets like NFTs and social/fan tokens.\n\nGet the source [here](https://medium.com/define-platform/social-nft-platform-define-announces-strategic-investment-from-tron-foundation-5499934d9214).",

While in the physical world ownership is mostly represented as static records, in the digital world ownership can be programmable, composable and, of course, intelligent.\n\nImagine NFTs conversing naturally like AI. The NFT can answer your questions to tell you everything about it's creation. Even better a NFT that changes according to your mood and give you a catered experience. Take Mimirtoken for example what if a game can be catered to you and your setting? We should think about the intersection of intelligent digital ownership as something that is possible with today\u2019s AI and NFT technologies. NFTs are likely to evolve as a digital ownership primitive and intelligence should definitely be part of it.\n\nSo NFT is the time now? Or should I wait?",

This also comes as a surprise because 10 years ago who would have thought Jack would be to sell his tweet as an NFT for millions of dollars.\n\n This is the world in which we live today. Highly pixelated artworks are one of the most sort-after commodities on the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThis invariably translates to an amazing opportunity for artists. This is because who else has the creative ability to develop NFT art. This career path is a highly lucrative one and I believe every artist should consider this career path.\n\n To put things in perspective, Beeple, (Mike Winkelmann), who is one of the most famous NFT artists today sold his now-famous NFT collage, Everydays: the First 5000 Days, for $69 million.\n\n Also, Pak who is an anonymous artist formerly known as Murat Pak in early 2020, has generated nearly $92 million in sales were generated. \n\nMad Dog Jones, Once described as \u201cthe most expensive living Canadian artist\u201d sold his first NFT, Replicator, for a mouth-watering $4.1 million, Mad Dog Jones has skyrocketed into the top 10 best-selling NFT artists in the world.\n\nThe numbers indeed speak for themselves and at this point, I wish I had this creative ability. Sadly I don\u2019t and will continue minting, buying, and selling NFTs created by amazing artists on platforms like the suku world.",

I\u2019m a creator and I know for a fact, sorry to NFT fans that you have to hear this from me, that NFTs are overhyped, and therein the problem lies. \nI knew that the first hack will disrupt the market and upset market sentiment for a long time, here\u2019s why. \n\nMost people in the NFT market are here to make profit, no shame in that. The NFT market is built upon layers and layers of people, each of different expertise level in the NFT and artist community.\n\n At the farthest level, which holds the highest number of people, these are the resellers and flippers, people who take art and sell it. These people have no dog in this fight, they don\u2019t really care about art, they\u2019re here as hustlers, again no shame.\n The problem however is that, despite their extremely lucrative contribution to liquidity within the market, they walk a thin line, and that line breaks at the nearest obstacle. \n\nThis obstacle came with the hack of the OpenSea platform, which had drastic effects. Most people on the extremities of the market gave up on the market and moved on, yes in a few days, and NFTs were forever handed a bad reputation. \nThis is shameful to see and horrible to witness. All the creator friends of mine are upset because of recent events. \n\nOpenSea was a bad platform, I\u2019ll be the first to say it. Their security was weak and they would just about let anyone mint and creator whatever. This is not how you run an art platform, though they were making the highest returns. Different NFT platforms like Rarible or Yunometa for example, would make artists go through a verification process, and later offer these artists better rights and compensation. \n\nThere should be some sort of vetting process at the threshold, because you can\u2019t just let anyone mint and create lest open the doors to scammers shillers an abusers. I hope OpenSea can learn from this experience.",

You can start by using platforms that only allow verified artists, such as Yunometa or Rarible, these will only ever promote artists that have went through the verification phase and have proven their ability and worth. \n\nMore importantly, it is better to spread the word about this and warn the world of what is happening.

I learned this fairly recently and it has been a life changer for me. \nI now know where it is best to spend my time and how valuable it is to me and to my portfolio. \n\nFor starters, I know that day trading is a waste of time and effort and rarely sees any good results over any short or long period. It gives you the illusion of wealth and power, and that is something I am in no need of. I think it is better to also enjoy your time while you are making profit.\n\n Like for example when you play NFT games you get both pleasure and monetary value. Axie and Kitty Inu have taken off recently for a reason, and when I play these games I begin to understand the appeal. \n\nTime is money, and knowing where to invest either is a superpower that no one tells you about.",

Playing traditional games does not cut it out for me when I can play a blockchain game with a Play-to-Earn feature and earn revenue streams in the process. \n\nWhen I found out about Goku, an ANIME NFT platform with intriguing gameplay and play to earn feature, I started nursing the idea of kissing traditional games goodbye.

By tokenizing real-world assets such as gold, images, music, collectibles, etc., blockchain adds value to these assets and integrates them with the cryptocurrency world. One of the industries that blockchain can revolutionize is digital photography. Every photographer might know, digital photography is plagued with several limitations such as image theft, no credibility, no monetary rewards, etc., and blockchain can help resolve these issues.  \n\n**Blockchain revolutionizing Digital Photography** \n\nBlockchain has proved to be successful in tokenizing different assets and optimizing their functionalities. Here are few ways blockchain helps digital photographers: Decentralization Cost Saving Secure Ownership Better Monetary Opportunities  \n\n**Picnab \u2014 Stock Photos Marketplace** \n\nPicnab is the world\u2019s first blockchain-powered NFt marketplace designed especially for digital photographers and artists. The platform uses NFTs to secure every image uploaded on their network and makes its ownership immutable. Picnab aims to tackle the problems digital photographers face and help them take control of their photos without diminishing their value. \n\n**Picnab takes a three-pronged approach to give the power back to the photographers:** \n\n1. Picnab assigns NFTs to the photos so they can be securely sold on its global marketplace. \n\n2. As NFTs are immutable, the photographers will always retain ownership of the image even if it\u2019s sold on the marketplace. \n\n3. Picnab users can download copies of original images to use freely. In turn, creators are rewarded with PIC (reward token by Picnab) on every download.  \n\n[Read more](https://picnab.medium.com/how-will-blockchain-change-photography-f9e36c49f540)",

However, the combination of DeFi and the recently booming NFT industry seems to be garnering more attention as the days go by. A typical example would be Farming on [r/dontbuymeme](https://www.reddit.com/r/dontbuymeme/) and getting NFTs as huge as the one sold by Beeple recently; ok, maybe not as huge but since there's a partnership, anything is possible. But you get the point, I think combining DeFi with NFT has been the best move so far.",

This would not have been possible without the amazing Monster community.\n\nThis is the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for...A few days ago, the entire [Gravity Vault](https://docs.cake.monster/protocol/the-gravity-vault) has been staked for the first time in the [manual PancakeSwap Syrup Pool](https://pancakeswap.finance/pools), which now rewards consistent CAKE at every single block (**Stage 1**).\n\nEach time [the Kitchen](https://docs.cake.monster/rewards/kitchen) is used to make CAKE, the collected staking rewards are re-staked in the Syrup Pool and all the CAKE bought via the Kitchen is added to the stake as well.\n\nThis currently results in a weekly Gravity Vault staking reward of approximately 300 CAKE and rising (\\~30,000 CAKE staked).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2j85cohn0gl71.png?width=1171&format=png&auto=webp&s=12b0499de90e7645d1592f4dceed8b5a677d5998\n\n# Double Compounding \ud83e\udd5e\n\nStaking the Gravity Vault in the Syrup Pool gives MONSTAs a sweet \u2018double\u2019 compounding effect.\n\n## Check this out\n\n1. When the CAKE in the Gravity Vault increases from taxed MONSTA transactions, CAKE is auto-added to the Syrup Pool each time a chef uses the Kitchen *(see figure 1 for tx details).*\n2. When the Syrup Pool rewards CAKE to the Gravity Vault, the remaining portion after the (yet to implement) distribution of NFT dividends (**Stage 2**) is automatically added back to the Vault.\n3. When these additional staking rewards are combined with the general Gravity Vault growth (via tax/auto-cashout), constant MONSTA supply deflation and MONSTA price appreciation, the result is a CAKE APY that far exceeds simply staking CAKE on your own!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/btchsbku0gl71.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&s=432339a9e746e4591cf118eab5c0b2c14d79b41a\n\n# Rewarding the $MONSTA Community \ud83d\udcb0\n\nThe CAKE rewards from the Syrup Pool will be used to benefit the Cake Monster community in multiple ways. (**Stage 2**)  \n\n\n1. 75% of the staking rewards will be distributed **equally** to all limited Diamond Claw Level 5 NFT holders who have their NFT **ACTIVE** (by holding a minimum of 0.1% of the current MONSTA supply). For example, if there are 200 active Level 5 NFTs and the total dividend for NFT holders is 1000 CAKE per week, each NFT owner would initially receive 5 CAKE (\\~$120) per week. The dividends, of course, will **increase exponentially** as the Gravity Vault grows over time, and so will the staking rewards. ***Always remember: The higher the MONSTA price, the more CAKE the protocol buys and the more CAKE can be distributed!***\n2. 25% of the staking rewards are going to support the Gravity Vault growth and will be re-deposited back into the Syrup Pool to benefit **ALL** MONSTA holders. This means that your \u201cslice\u201d along with the claimable crumbs grows faster and faster per 1% deflation, whether you have an NFT or not!\n3. All unclaimed NFT dividends are returned to the Gravity Vault to support further Gravity Vault growth and increase everyone's slice and crumbs.\n\n## How to earn these CAKE Dividends?\n\nTo earn these dividends simply hold an **ACTIVE** Level 5 NFT, sit back, and watch your earnings grow. You will be able to claim the CAKE dividends every 3 days via their [dApp](http://app.cake.monster/) and you must claim within the following 3 days or your dividends will be sent back to the Gravity Vault.\n\nMONSTAs who wish to obtain a Level 5 NFT to participate in dividend distribution (and other benefits) can purchase one [**HERE**](https://treasureland.market/collection/0x69988cd7d86151244e9b2a2a80d0925195055f48) on TreasureLand.\n\n*Make sure you are only purchasing the VERIFIED NFTs (Look for the blue medal icon with \u201cV\u201d in the center).*\n\nIf you do not hold a Level 5 NFT don\u2019t fret \u2014 ALL users benefit as a portion of the staking rewards (25%) is deposited in the Gravity Vault and added back to the Syrup Pool for additional compounding, which increases your slice and your crumbs.\n\n## MONSTA Timeline:\n\n**Rewards/Dividends will be released in two stages**\n\n**Stage 1** (Deployed)\n\n* 100% of Syrup Pool rewards are deposited in the CAKE Gravity Vault and are restaked with the added CAKE from the Kitchen.\n\n**Stage 2** (Friday, September 10)\n\n* 75% of the Syrup Pool staking rewards are awarded to active Level 5 NFT holders.\n* NFT dividends become available every three days and are claimable via the [dApp](https://app.cake.monster/). You have to claim your dividends before the next round starts.\n* The remaining 25% of the Syrup Pool staking rewards and any unclaimed dividends after three days will be deposited in the Gravity Vault.\n\n# Effects on the Cake Monster Ecosystem \ud83d\udcc8\n\nCurrently, a Level 5 Diamond Claw NFT requires a Monster to hold 0.1% of the total MONSTA supply to receive its benefits. If there are 200 of these NFTs active, this would mean that **20% of the MONSTA supply (200 x 0.1%) is locked up and technically out of circulation**. This has a huge stabilizing effect on the MONSTA price as NFT holders have an incentive to hold on to their MONSTA if they want to earn a steadily growing passive CAKE income.\n\nAdditionally, valid whitelist entrants who claimed all 5 airdrops were eligible to mint a Level 5 NFT. Approximately 200 of those have been minted thus far, but these remain inactive until the owner purchases the required $MONSTA, or sells the Level 5 NFT to someone who has enough funds to activate it.\n\nIf all of the Level 5 NFTs are activated this would lock up **over 40%** of the supply in the wallets of \u201cDiamond Hands\u201d (not counted Level 1\u20134 NFTs)!\n\n## Supply Shock\n\nAnyone who wants to purchase enough MONSTA to activate their Level 5 NFT will have to do so from the PancakeSwap liquidity pool. Currently there is only enough MONSTA left for sale (\\~150M) to activate an additional 16 NFTs, which would cause a supply crisis and send the price parabolic.\n\nThe reason for this dynamic is the [auto-cashout](https://docs.cake.monster/protocol/auto-cashout) function, buying MONSTA of inactive wallets and burning the acquired MONSTA out of the LP.\n\nThis is causing a serious supply squeeze which translates to a higher token valuation. The Diamond Claw NFTs locking up substantial amounts of supply plus a supply shock in the liquidity pool is a highly explosive combination! \ud83d\ude2e\n\n# What else?\n\n* With Staking Stage 2, MONSTA will publish an adjustment of the daily cash out limit from 30 to 40 per day. The cash out timings will be adjusted to 10 cash outs every six hours (0,6,12,18 UTC). This will give much better chances to Monsters worldwide in any time zone.\n* Technical [webpage](https://cake.monster/)/[dApp ](https://app.cake.monster/)improvements\n* Added a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section in their MONSTA documentation.\n\nJoin the community on [Telegram](https://t.me/cakemnstr)!",

Partly because they are afraid to take risks, but more likely because they don\u2019t thoroughly understand NFTs. As their CEO nudges them to \u201cdo something in NFTs,\u201d they react impulsively and kick off a project in earnest. Mostly they do it just because everybody else is doing it. I recently came across Atpay, real token that adds value. These marketing firms should do more research and get to the real coins. Instead of randomly making NFTs now.",

I love how I can relate to the artworks, it's not just about minted abstract unemotional pieces, if an artiste cannot send a message to his audience through his work then maybe he's not doing something right. But when it comes to the $MEME and Enjin projects from their different companies respectively. You can tell they're very particular about their pieces, but of course one can't get too emotional with these things, so emotions aside, Please comment and let me know what you think.",

In addition to the  vast wealth of experience and wisdom she  brings as an industry expert,  Carol\u2019s appointment as our second  independent director will help us  further strengthen our corporate  governance, a key element in our  planned uplisting to a senior  exchange.\u201d\n\nAn  internationally  recognized authority on and pioneer in legal issues  involving  cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, Ms. Van Cleef is  Chair of  the Blockchain and Digital Assets practice at Bradley Arant  Boult  Cummings LLP. With a focus on regulatory, compliance, and  enforcement  matters, Ms. Van Cleef has built a global reputation as a  leading  attorney, counsellor and problem solver working extensively  across the  financial services industry and throughout the cryptocurrency  and  blockchain communities. She represents virtual currency exchanges,   blockchain developers, NFT creators and platforms, and various types of   financial services and fintech companies.\n\nIn   addition to her legal practice, Ms. Van Cleef serves as CEO of  Luminous  Group, a blockchain technology, growth advisory and risk  management  solutions company that also develops and delivers anti-money  laundering  and sanctions compliance training through the AML Training  Institute.  She also serves as an advisor to a number of early-stage  companies in  fintech and blockchain-related technologies.\n\n\u201cI   am excited to join the BTCS board,\u201d commented Ms. Van Cleef. \u201cI  believe  my background and legal experience will be an asset to BTCS as  it  continues to grow its operations. BTCS was the first U.S. public  company  to mine bitcoin in 2014 and the first to launch a digital asset   treasury strategy in 2017. I look forward to working closely with   management as they continue to execute on their vision for long-term   success.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe plan to appoint a  third  independent director shortly,\u201d continued Allen. \u201cA third  independent  director would make the majority of our board independent, a  key  requirement to list on a national securities exchange such as  Nasdaq.\u201d\n\n[Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/01/2203275/0/en/BTCS-Welcomes-New-Independent-Director-to-Strengthen-Corporate-Governance-in-Preparation-for-Planned-Uplist-to-Senior-Exchange.html)",

NFT utility, as long as the contract hasn\u2019t been coded by a complete numpty, can be completely backended as the metaworlds that accommodate them are built out on the blockchain. The code that comes with your grinning, perfect ape can, ultimately, be used as registration (secure as any private key held in crypto) for anything that the person requiring it wants.  \n The NFT market is currently valued at $7 billion, according to JP Morgan. Never before, not even with Bitcoin, were so many analysts calling it a bubble. Everyone is waiting for the story to end and the market to crash and the rich to win again. Yet right now, the NFT market is churning out winners, and the show is going on. With the rise of the metaverse and the NFT tokens that will open their doors, the bubble might be more resistant than detractors think. We are all ultimately apes, caught in the crossfire of a gas war, our meagre sentiment gushed into one little jpeg for the hope and meaning it provides \u2014 and the future it will unlock.   \nWhat you guys think?   \n[More](https://medium.com/onomy-protocol/key-in-how-nfts-are-the-fad-thatll-define-the-future-7f4fdc91afd2)",

Big companies like FACEBOOK & GOOGLE have our precious data at their fingertips to be able to use it anytime for their own purposes. This thought has got me thinking if there were any alternatives to centralized social networks.\n\nWith much due diligence and time spent surfing the internet, I have discovered that there actually exists a social networking revolution that is built on the Polkadot network which enables users to freely and securely use social networking in such a way that our data is safe from any third party companies. The discovery is known as the Subsocial Network.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty dope site wherein, they will soon integrate an NFT marketplace and all. It's basically like Reddit at its infancy stages but of course, decentralized. You can make your own \u201cSpaces\u201d which are basically the equivalent of Subreddits. Even made my own space and first blog post on it!\n\nFor the more in-depth technicalities of its tech, check out this link to a video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO1KFndiAMk&t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO1KFndiAMk&t=3s)\n\nMake sure to check it out for yourself at\n\nWebsite:\n\n[https://subsocial.network/](https://subsocial.network/)\n\nTwitter:\n\n[https://twitter.com/SubsocialChain](https://twitter.com/SubsocialChain)",

Many people prefer getting more golden eggs and they have  been rickrolling with their Polkacity assets: \n\nAs the Mandalorians say, [this is the way](https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29888972/the-mandalorian-this-is-the-way/). Keeping your passive  income-generating asset and getting more would only help your future  self. Many people see their future selves as separate person and this  prevents them from having large gains while smart folks see their future  selves as a part of their persona today, and invest in their future.\n\nThere  are always risks involved in cryptocurrency projects, or in any asset  for that matter, but would you think investing in ETH when it was 1.5  USD was risky and give up? People who rickrolled, or \u201cnever gave up\u201d on  Ethereum made it. As our team of engineers is working hard on the  Polkacity platform, we are releasing new assets continuously at cheaper  prices, and letting small investors join the fun!\n\nThis [3D Augmented Reality skateboard NFT](https://www.polkacity.io/skateboard) costs only 150 POLC and gives you an 8 % monthly return:\n\nIt is customizable and you can select the Rugged version as you see above, or grab the Polka, City, or the Taxi version.\n\nWe also have the Lambo in various colors including the Gold color:  \n All our taxi drones are sold out, but you can still get the remaining  assets. 2D assets are also on sale, and they will be swapped to 3D  before the game launches. We have been burning the unsold 2D assets, so  you may not get another chance to get a hot dog stand or a Limo. The  Polkacity future is bright and we are expecting to release the game soon  with more centralized exchanges according to our roadmap.",

We are excited to welcome Decentralized Vulnerability Platform (DVP), Piction Network (PXL), Umbrella Network (UMB), and Kryptos Capital as the latest members of our ecosystem.\n\nThe Korean Polkadot Alliance is a non-profit consortium of industry-leading projects that include Polkadot-based cross-chain protocol RAI Finance, synthetic asset issuance platform Standard Tokenization Protocol, and leading Korean blockchain community Cobak. They are joined by prominent Asia-based cryptofunds NGC Ventures and GBIC.\n\nKPA\u2019s mission is to facilitate and accelerate the development of the Polkadot ecosystem in Korea. The exciting addition of these new partners to our ecosystem will provide all members of our organization with support in the fields of security, NFT product development, and off-chain data fields.\n\nFurther to our mission of incubating a better Korean Polkadot ecosystem, our future plans include bidding for a parachain slot on Polkadot and facilitating Parachain Lease Offerings (PLOs) by helping members to prepare for the parachain auction process. We will organize talks, discussions, meetups, and other events focused specifically around the Polkadot ecosystem in Korea.\n\nWe encourage blockchain projects, teams, and developers who are building on the Polkadot network to join us on our mission! We also happily welcome international projects and teams who are currently looking to tap into the Polkadot ecosystem in Korea.\n\nRead more [here](https://kpalliance.medium.com/the-korean-polkadot-alliance-kpa-welcomes-four-new-members-5e7b88e84db).",

The average sports fan justifies the passion they have for an athlete, a sports organization, or a team by rehashing the same excuse: It's more than just sports. And while there is some truth to this, it is hard to convey the logic behind such a statement to non-sports individuals. However, with the emergence of NFT sports implementation, every avid sports follower has one more argument to back up their love for one or more franchises, athletes and teams.\n\nNew Project ITSMYNE is being launched soon in the field of sport.

            "text": "Non-fungible tokens (NFT) are digital assets that represent a wide range of unique tangible and intangible items, from collectible sports cards to virtual real estate and even digital sneakers. \n\nUnlike regular cryptocurrencies, NFTs cannot be directly exchanged with one another. This is because no two NFTs are identical \u2013 even those that exist on the same platform, game or in the same collection. Think of them as festival tickets. Each ticket contains specific information including the purchaser\u2019s name, the date of the event and the venue. This data makes it impossible for festival tickets to be traded with one another. \n\nNFTs have become hugely popular with crypto users and companies alike because of the way they revolutionized the gaming and collectibles space. Since November 2017, there has been a total of $174 million spent on NFTs.  Thanks to the advent of blockchain technology, gamers and collectors can become the immutable owners of in-game items and other unique assets as well as make money from them. \n\n**About PolkaCity**\n\n \n\nPolkaCity is a first-of-its-kind NFT, DeFi and contract-based project with overwhelming support from the virtual reality community. PolkaCity brings a viable platform where an ordinary individual can access the virtual city, invest in the city, and make passive income without cumbersome processes. Investors in the virtual city can invest in such things as taxi services, gas stations, hotels and essential services, all in one place.\u00a0 \n\n The project team takes a truly innovative approach in the NFT world. As proof of this, you can look at the under development 3D & AR NFT, pictured below. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uetbpn7pvtp61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b20405f01848ac6274b33a4aaa3ca1144f074b6b\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***The POLC token of the polkacity project continues its steady rise.
