            "selftext": "We keep hearing horror stories of people losing large sums of money investing in Terra Luna. Some of those people were early investors who believed in the project and couldn't possibly foresee what was about to happen. But what we're not hearing a lot about are the people who invested in Terra while it was collapsing. To be honest, I almost became one of them. When the price of Terra fell below $10, I was seriously thinking about throwing a grand into it in hopes that some miracle would happen and the price would go back up. But then I looked closely at the supply and realized that this was not the same Terra that was valued at over $100 per coin. At the time, the supply was approaching 1 billion. Now there are over 6 trillion in circulation. Even if I had waited until the price fell to one cent, I would have lost that entire grand. I'm sure there are some people on here who made that mistake and are now regretting it. So, let's hear your stories!",
