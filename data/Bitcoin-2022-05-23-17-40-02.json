Welcome to the community! \n\nBitcoin can't go negative, it doesn't work like that. Hypothetically, bitcoin can go to zero, in which case you'll lose your $100. This is not very likely, it hasn't been close to zero since 2011. The most likely case is that bitcoin price will go down for a bit before going back up. It hit a high price last November, which means it'll be a few years before it starts going up again. \n\nSo, if you put in $100 today, what will happen? The likeliest scenario is that it'll go down to $80 or even $60 over the next year or two, then jump back up to $200-300 in about 3-4 years. But honestly, no one knows for sure, we can only estimate based on how it moved in the past.",
