So can we as humans with our asset holding decisions.\n\nThe profitability for miners in the next hundred years will depend on the price of bitcoin, it will not necessarily decrease. Opening lightning channels will always require on-chain transactions. LN will probably never be used for large transactions.\n\nSleep peacefully!",
