Here are a few reasons given:\n\n\"The blockchain is sometimes slow\" - Umm.. no the transaction doesn't even have a hashID, it's not out on the blockchain yet, there's no transactionID - it's in Coinbase que as pending.\n\n\"It's a bug on our end\" Ok I can buy that, agent said he has no idea when it will be fixed.\n\n\"Our system has multiple phone accounts with your phone number and the system doesn't know which to send it to\" Really? So when I asked 10+ times to investigate the other account as it is a fraud, your agents never said anything about opening an investigation. Weird right? I can send you 3 PDF's of chat where you can see them ignoring my request to investigate the supposed duplicate phone number.\n\n\"Clear your history and cookies\" Mind you this was told to me, the receiver who sees NOTHING about any transaction pending or being delayed. What do cookies have to do with it? I cleared them anyway, no change. Laughable.\n\n\"Just cancel the transaction, sometimes this happens\" ....\n\nTO BE CLEAR.. this pending transaction would've been worth $900+ USD as I would've received it, cashed it into USD and that was the current value. If I cancel it now, it would be worth $500, ya owe me $400 due to your error.\n\nThis was a COINBASE to COINBASE customer transaction. Both accounts KYC'd. Sender sent it to my phone number... transactions are supposed to be instant. Fix your issue, also... fix your customer service agents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo your best: \n\nCase# 11853432\n\nCase# 11853815\n\nCase#11680663\n\nand 10+ other calls that we didn't get the case #'s to",

Coinbase customer service said they could not see that the requests had been made. For the ones which did go through, it was within a few minutes. Apparently, if it does not transfer after some period, Coinbase just shrugs and forgets about it, without keeping any record if the failure. This is not businesslike. There should be an acknowledgement by email when a transfer fails because of network congestion or whatever. Customer service should be able to see requests, and there should be an accessible listing on Coinbase of successful and unsuccessful requests.",
