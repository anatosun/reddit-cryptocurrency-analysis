Microsoft is using DIDs with their Sidetree implementation on the Bitcoin Blockchain (did:ion). Similar technology exists for Ethereum, and the DID spec is likely to be solidified in W3C soon. \n\nThe most common application for DIDs today is for digital signatures, and DIDs are commonly used for identifying a person or organization signing Verifiable Credentials (another W3C standard which is already in use in the market today). Governments around the world are beginning to explore DID and VC standards for digital licenses and other important documents.",

I know it's proof of stake but are there any transactions happening on that layer ?  If not, what are the stakers validating ?   \n\n\nAlso, will we still have both an EL and a CL after the merge ? I'd love to understand it in more detail (give me some maths <3) but I think I need a broad understanding beforehand.   \n\n\nThanks",

You can see more here: http://beaconcha.in\n\nIt\u2019s already securing billions of dollars worth of value, and is waiting for The Merge to be triggered.\n\nTransactions don\u2019t happen on this layer, just block validation/production.\n\nYes we will still have EL and CL after the merge (previously described as ETH1 and ETH2 in merge documentation).",
