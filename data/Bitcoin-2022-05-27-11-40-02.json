Therefore this flight would produce 5.9 tonnes of CO2.\"\n\n\nSource: https://www.bbc.com/news/59135899\n\nMine I calculated with \"carbonfootprint.com\" can't tell how reliable it is, but it is 5.48 (using data such as anual costs in each category such as food and detailed energy bill) [yes I am a climate conscious person].",

Today you assume your government wouldn\u2019t let companies lie about their products to you to make profits). \n\nThat\u2019s also how btc spreads - some people with authority understood how it works, other follow (sometimes blindly). \n\nIt\u2019s ok to have authorities (politicians, scientists, economists, spiritual leaders, enterpreneurs etc.), but yep, it is up to us to screen them constantly to see if they are honest with us. That\u2019s a challenge for sure. But still - those authorities are those with responsibility imo. If they missuse it, they are bad actors and responsible for the damage they did to people who were listening to them.\n\nEdit: my solution to this problem is a system where those bad actors are punished once their bad intentions are disclosed, so trusting is easier in general. But this is a political view ofc.",

This is why it is \"total control of humans\" instead of the marketing term \"improve the planet\". We all want to improvement the planet, but there should be a choose or options that can be debated and chosen.  Worse is that the rich will just pay there way out of it, and middle class and the poor will suffer the most.

We already know jets, boats, vehicles already contribute greatly but to have the tool available that one could check their own personal footprint. There's nothing wrong with that. You are now more understanding of the universe around you personally.  I know I'd look at it. I want to be able to track this like I can track the weather. A useful app even if I flew on jets. If I could afford one I'd be getting one that is more energy efficient for sure.",
