Im not using the account, im officially below the poverty line now. They absolutely CAN give it back to me, i want to close the account and i want my money back. I dont know why they are gojng to force me to make a stink about it but i will file a report to the appropriate agency if i have to - they have 360 dollars of eth that i desperately need.",
