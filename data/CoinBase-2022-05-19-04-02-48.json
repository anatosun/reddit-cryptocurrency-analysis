            "selftext": "I set up my Coinbase account normally with a regular phone number, but now I don't want to keep that phone account and would rather switch to a VOIP phone number (trying to save on costs), but, trying to update my new VOIP phone number on my Coinbase Account, I am notified that VOIP #'s (like Google Voice) are not accepted.  \n\n\nSo, I'm going to have to keep paying for my very expensive phone service in order to be able to continue accessing my Coinbase account? Can we REMOVE the NECESSITY for having a phone number associated with the Coinbase account altogether? I'm not a huge fan of \"mandatory\" safety for my own good. Why don't you folks allow me the privilege of deciding how safely and securely I'd like to operate?",

In addition to that they can number spoof and geo spoof. Your active phone number is part of identifying you as being from a particular country or region.\n\nThe more you make a fuss about it and not just do what normal people do and get a government regulated phone number attached to your name, the more of a scammer you look to everyone else, hence the massive backlash against you here.\n\n99.999% of people would simply add a cell number or fixed line number. If you claim not to have one, have access to one, and refuse to use one, and having been told by coinbase that you need one, then there's fuck all you can do here by throwing a temper tantrum like an angsty teen who's doing shady things behind his parent's backs.",
