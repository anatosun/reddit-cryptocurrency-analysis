Just tried twice to transfer some bitcoin to two different wallets and it just seems to have vanished with no record in my Coinbase history and no sign of it in either wallet. Should have been paying more attention but my balance has decreased by the amount I sent so it must have left my wallet. Fully appreciate I might be being an idiot here but any advice would be appreciated.",
