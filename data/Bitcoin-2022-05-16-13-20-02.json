As for the drug dealer part, I don't think Ulbricht really did a whole lot of that himself. Silkroad was a marketplace, not a seller.\n\n> SAT of 1460\n\nWhich according to the SAT website puts him in the 96th percentile of people who have taken the SAT test. Quite high, but not necessarily genius level.\n\n> If you look at Satoshi\u2019s earliest post he asks for a lot of advice and help.\n\nThe very first public communication from Satoshi was the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper. By then, he had already solved the key issues surrounding distributed consensus that had blocked previous attempts at a decentralized currency. Sure, he asked for help with implementation details later on, but when Satoshi entered the scene, the actual genius-level stuff was already done.",

All my crypto-activity is noted. It helps me stay calm and it also keeps me away from just doing dumb stuff because I have the barrier of noting it down (yes, it made me lose opportunity but it also prevented me from stupidity, so I personally am very happy).\n\nNow.\n\nA bit less than a week ago now (am still puzzled) I sent some BTC to the exchange because I wanted to trade for a coin I expect more upside of. Let's say, I had X BTC, and I sent X/2 to the exchange. Now what happened was, I didn't have X/2 in my Ledger-Wallet left, but X+X/2 BTC!! It just ADDED what I sent.... And also, my whole Ledger history adjusted everywhere with +X/2 !!\n\nI have SO MANY questions... And as said, I keep track very eagerly and I checked everything... And it is just as I described... I also checked the transaction stuff... There's NO additional transaction and the transaction numbers count up to what I *should* have (X/2) but still it shows me more.\n\nWhat should I do? I am afraid that if I send it to the exchange, it vanishes also what I *really* have left on my Ledger. Idk. I am very confused especially because it just casually adjusted the whole history.\n\nAm very very grateful for any help or advice. And thanks for reading!",
