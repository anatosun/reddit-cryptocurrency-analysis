So ledgers can be cold storage where coins can't be send without the physical device (or the seedphrase). For your ledger you don't need to expose your seedphrase you can just use their software which ensures that your seedphrase is never written out onto a computer which is an additional level of distance between your seedphrase and the internet.\n\nIf you had a mobile wallet that is considered hot as the device is almost always connected to the internet and it doesn't require anything else in order to send and your wallet was most likely created on that device which is connected to the internet so there is higher risk associated with it.\n\nAirgapped means that the device doesn't directly connect to the internet. So things like using a cold card with an SD or a paper wallet could be considered airgapped where it was created entirely disconnected from the internet and in theory would never have to be directly connected to a computer in order to use the wallet.",
