This market was created to ensure privacy  and Facebook is in direct violation of that.\n\nFacebook is known for profiting off of our personal data through monetizing it by selling it to advertisement companies all without our consent. And this would be disastrous if implemented in the crypto market.\n\nWe need to start seeing more projects that fight this. I think there are protocols like Ocean known for letting people have full control of how they monetize their personal data. So far they\u2019re using it for scientific purposes only but I think they have a lot of room to expand on this and maybe inspire other projects to start doing the same to end up fighting Facebook\u2019s unwelcome intrusion into this market.\n\nI swear to god nothing ever good came from Facebook or Mark Zuckerberg.",
