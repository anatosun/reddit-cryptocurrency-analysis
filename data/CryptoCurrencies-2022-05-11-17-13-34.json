They want that when you take profits, that you create a taxable event.\n\nUm, currently in the US, every time you swap one crypto for another its a taxable event.  Stable coins actually cost the tax man money as they have no chance for apperciation.\n\nSo swapping XBT for XET would be taxable.  Going from XBT to  any stable would be a taxable event.  \n\nGoing from a stable coin to another coin is taxable but generates no tax as there is no capital gains.\n\nFiat has nothing todo with any of this.",
