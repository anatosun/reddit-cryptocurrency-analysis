I download my photo of the ID, but the next step is always making me download it again instead of moving forward with verification. It\u2019s just going in circles. Coinbase support is also sending me copy and paste answers, saying my account has to be secured, and that my birthday does not match with my photo ID. That is ridiculous. And it\u2019s not true. Then they send me the link to update my personal info, and the link says that I should contact support. So it\u2019s going in circles",
