It might be that ledger is waiting for an number of confirmations before displaying it.  When you did the send did you confirm your receive address on the ledger? It\u2019s one of the nice features of the ledger device it makes it a lot easier to be sure you\u2019re using the correct address.  Pretty sure in ledger live desktop you can drop down advanced in receive and change the derivation path to the previous one to see the last address it used.  Not sure if there is another way.  Be sure to check the address you sent to in exodus.",
