            "selftext": "Even after showing unparalleled potential, De-Fi and cryptocurrencies, including BTC, aren't sustainable as per ECB.     \nAs per Daily Coin, BTC and other digital assets have no economic value or future. The body is issuing warnings frequently to implement regulations and stop the growth of the market.  However, the demand for Cryptocurrency isn't stopping and growing exponentially.    \nThe reason behind it might be the promising future of crypto. Utility based projects like Ripple and TokLok are still expanding the community more. Ripple has taken the place of payment gateways due to its speed and transaction fees. While TokLok is a messaging app that provides over-the-par privacy by deleting all data for its servers and keeping it confidential to users only that has topped that sector surpassing signal too.   \nThere are numerous other contributing projects to the expansion of De-Fi. ECB might remain successful in convincing regulators of countries to implement restrictions.   \nBut, looking at the craze, it seems impossible to regulate any massive change or hinder the growth of cryptocurrencies.BTC and markets are near to their all-time-lows of the last three years. It seems the community is used to crashes now, and sentiments are the market will even grow to new heights after downfalls like it is doing again and again.That is my opinion what is yours?",
