Most of the time they change headline for the same garbage.\n\nI would highly recommend to ignore these guys or anything you see published by them. They are nothing but bunch of nayers keeps spreading unbiased articles in my opinion.\n\nA while ago they kept pumping Bitgert day and night to trap weak mind investors. Then they went after SHIB to trash, and now turned onto Dogecoin to spread lots of negativity. On Goggle news tab you see them posting 80% or article that is nothing but JYD (Junk Yard Dog)\n\nPlease stay strong, and ignore those articles. Better stay away from most news articles.\n\nStay Strong and HODL.",
