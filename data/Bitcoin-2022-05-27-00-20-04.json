I remember going to fancy dress parties where people would dress as the Jamaican Bobsleigh Team, with legit good bodysuits, and black/brownface as well.\n\nThere was no hint of racism, cultural appropriation, prejudice or anything. Everyone thought it was brilliant, and IMO it wouldn't have been as impressive if their faces looked white. \n\nAlso the infamous Aladdin photo was taken many years ago. \n\nI really don't get why some people can't tell the difference between legitimate prejudice against POC (like using blackface to humiliate/make black people look dumb or silly like 'minstrels) I agree that that is wrong, but context is very important. Just rewatch Tropic Thunder to try and understand the nuances.\n\nIt seems to me that most people arguing about this aren't even really involved. I remember a few recent instances of alleged \"cultural appropriation\" which were ridiculous. E.g. the celebrity that dressed in a kimono, where loads of white Americans went mental, but lots of Japanese thought it was great that their traditional clothing was being worn by other races. \n\nAlso the whole backlash of casting ScarJo as Motoko Kusanagi in the Ghost in the Shell remake. (not a great remake, but I digress). Nearly everyone who was saying they should have cast a Japanese actor:\n\nWere not Japanese, didn't understand that the original manga/anime was based in a fictional version of Hong Kong, not Japan. And also in the anime, the races of the characters are vague. Motoko looks a bit Asian, but also looks a bit white, and actually her cyborg body shell is technically a mass produced Caucasian body.\n\nTL;DR people need to stop worrying about stupid trivial shit, especially when it's in the past",

The entire list of restrictions has been scientifically proven not to work, just like those \"jabs\" that do not stop from being infected or from spreading infection. However these mandates are killing the society and giving people long term physical stress (cortisol). Cortisol on long term basis destroys the entire body because it goes directly to the cell and damages it. People are being physically, emotionally tortured. How you don't get it is beyond me. Perhaps you are completely autistic or just a psychopath not to understand it. So fuck off now.",

That's just a fundraising platform being used by organizers. A regular Bitcoin address would work great too, like they did with the Tonga disaster relief fundraising efforts. I suppose you would prefer every single trucker post their bitcoin address? That would be pretty cool.\n\nI don't think it's a scam, but you don't need to donate. Vaccine efficacy aside, medical choices are very personal and should not be forced upon people by government.\n\nThe post is on topic because it has to do with government censorship of financial transactions that are intended to protest government oppression.

The thing with Bitcoin is, once you understand it it's hard not to go a little bit off the rails from awe and excitement hence why you get people acting like fanatics, even if it is in jest. Still, do your own research and keep your head on your shoulders. There's a lot of good research done on Bitcoin by smart people, just stay away from all the hyperbole \"influencer\" YouTubers. I like Robert Breedlove, the What Bitcoin Did podcast, Andreas Antonopoulos and Trader University on YouTube for calm, factual information on Bitcoin. Jeff Booth's interviews are also great to listen to IMO and I really enjoy [Gigi's writings](https://dergigi.com/) as well. They get a bit philosophical but that's why I like them!\n\nI don't think you can just \"get\" bitcoin over a snappy 2 minute video even if the core idea can be summarised in a brief paragraph. At least for me it took a year of reading and listening to allow the idea to rejig my view of the world and money to accommodate this new angle.",
