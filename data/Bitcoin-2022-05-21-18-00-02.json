They are confiscating your wealth and distributing it to the industry in their best interest. Income tax just takes from you to give to someone else. It doesn't \"fix\" money supply hyperinflation. The only thing that can is turning off the faucet (money printer) and you know that will never happen. All they do is reduce inbound which makes consumers think their dollar is safer because it isn't collapsing as quickly as it was before the reduced faucet.

Show something that demonstrates that the stabilization of global currencies is inevitable and not just a doom cycle of:\n\n1. print money\n2. inflation goes up\n3. interest rates go up to counter inflation\n4. increases to interest rates increase the country's deficit (rate at which the country loses money due to interest payments on their country's debt)\n5. printing money to pay the deficit\n\nThis invariably leads to a switch to another currency.  What's bananas is that there are countries that think that a CBDC's financial control over people's bank accounts will actually solve things.  What it will do is create a phenomenal level of instability.  Like, phenomenal.\n\nI wonder if they've even thought this far down the road.  I mean, do we still imagine there will be elections when the existing party has the power to defund the other one?  Good luck.  What about people that don't appreciate the current government?  Their finances are safe?\n\nNo, I think you're stuck a couple years back before the M2 supply punched the nail in the coffin.",

                    "response": ">How can btc be going down if the market is also down\n\nBecause, btc's correlation to the US stock market is high (0.88 to 1 on the S&P when I last checked) & because more than 40% of btc ownership is in the US.\n\nBTC is a risk asset like a lot of stocks. When the stock market goes down people want to decrease their risk.\n\nPrices go down to find buyers. It doesn't necessarily mean it's leaving the market. Institutions have been accumulating while retail individuals like you and me have been panic selling. As bitcoin grows in adoption \n\nYou can't use bitcoins fundamentals as a factor in its price anymore. Most know its fundamentals and now want to see how they can extract the most from its use case to their advantage. Nowadays it's price driven by investor sentiment from whales especially, open interest on futures contracts, bots and probably governments as more seek to adopt it.",
