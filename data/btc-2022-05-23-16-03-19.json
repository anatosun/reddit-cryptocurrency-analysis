The Cashscript /next fork has it, but it isn't released yet. \n\nI think it's possible to code an on-chain faucet contract in about 7 lines of Cashscript that pays out 5000 sat to the first person to hit it over an interval.  I think a perpetuity can be done in about 12 lines. I think there is going to be exciting things happening on BCH directly.",
