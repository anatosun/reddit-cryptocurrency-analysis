Earlier this week I went to go pay my rent and put in my amount and much to my chagrin, I am able to spend it for nearly a full week. There are no other indications of something changing that are obvious to me. \n\nIs this just a recent policy change that I missed the memo or about? Or is there something I can actually do to go back to instant usage? I don\u2019t think my account is \u201climited\u201d in any way.",

Now, After about two months,  every deposit has a wait from 3-5-8 days. I noticed the more deposits I made, the longer the wait time would be. For example, I deposited $100 and it was available in three days, a couple days later I deposited $100 more and it says 5 days, I added more about a week ago and now its on hold for 8 days. \n\nI guess they are doing something on the back end to limit liability but 8 days is kinda nuts for funds to clear when they have been deducted from my bank and cleared for 5+ days.",
