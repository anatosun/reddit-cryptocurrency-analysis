($8.5B in the last year)\n\n[https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/metrics/protocol\\_revenue](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/metrics/protocol_revenue)\n\nI'm wondering where does all this ETH go? A DAO? ETH miners? Thanks!",

A small tip is given to miners currently, but will go to stakers after The Merge.\n\n\nBy burning the base transaction fees the value in effect is going to all ether holders through deflationary pressure.\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that 'burning' in this case doesn't mean sending it to a burn address, but rather it is completely removed from the network.\n\n\nYou can watch the burn at https://watchtheburn.com/.",

That are 30\\*24\\*3600secs/13secs \\~200k ETH in 30 days with 13 seconds block time. Those go to the miners.\n\nMiners can also earn tips (part of the transaction fees). \n\nThis is all independent of the mentioned burned ETH which might positively impact the price.\n\nNote however that the supply will significantly decrease when Ethereum switches to Proof of Stake (estimate a 80%-90%reduction in newly minted ETH) due to a different reward scheme.",
