For many people this means that Ethereum is not a sensible chain to use for just sending tokens from one place to another, but this is clearly something that a lot of people do with about $29.2 billion just transferred per day [https://money-movers.info/]. \n\nMore obviously valuable are the opportunities available in DeFi [https://defillama.com/chain/Ethereum], with things like decentralized exchanges, lending and borrowing platforms, futures trading etc potentially generating vastly more return than the cost of ether required to use them. People spent almost $2 million in ether just using UniSwap in the last 24 hours [https://cryptofees.info/].\n\nSo the simple answer is that you're right that you have to give up ether to use the network, but if what you're doing generates more profit than you spent doing it then you can just use that to buy back more ether than you started with anyway.",
