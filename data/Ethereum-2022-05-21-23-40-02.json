This will however be addressed with the implementation of sharding and this is exactly what I\u2019m so bullish about honestly.\n\nSharding will help L2s scale even better than they are right now (which they already are doing one hell of job with)\n\nSharding will be of utmost importance to the chain especially now that Ethereum is focused so much ZK tech and is already shifting towards it.  \nThis is very apparent when you see how much Vitalik os fond of Polygon.\n\nWith more than billion dollars allocated towards ZK technology development and more than 4 ZK based scaling solutions in Polygon\u2019s arsenal (Polygon Miden, Polygon Zero, Polygon Hermez and Polygon nightfall), I think that sharding will be implemented very easily later on since the infrastructure is already there for it. It just needs to be implemented after a couple upgrades that come before it (one of which is obviously merging)\n\nEthereum has been around since 2015 but it looks like its only just begun right now. We\u2019re only getting start and the road to ETH2.0 is slowly but surely starting to become clearer and clearer.",

Sharding will initially give Ethereum \\~2 orders of magnitude more data availability. This is still very low for most web2 apps. No significant ecosystem could completely migrate to Ethereum after sharding. Think of the storage requirements of twitter, reddit, facebook, youtube etc'. Sharding won't do even for a single one of them. At most, it will enable some aspects to become decentralized/immutable/user-owned, like karma on reddit.\n2. Excellent data-availability solutions already exist (mostly in theory, but some with applications), and can/are integrated into the existing Ethereum ecosystem. Validity on computations can be proven on-chain, while data stored by a comity, or optionally by users. These solutions are scaling Ethereum today, and sharding will have to enter an environment with multiple existing alternatives (with trade-offs).",

The bet is that your specific shard will not be 64x as popular, but will be 16x as popular, one of 256 services, so a 4x discount on gas price.\n\nMaking up numbers, as it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019re going to be a power of two, but I hope it illustrates the point",
