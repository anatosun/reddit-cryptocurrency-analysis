Making electric cars better and pushing the market forward so that large companies will switch much sooner than they would have without Tesla\n2. Building re-usable rockets something that saves NASA and other space agencies around the world billions of dollars annually\n3. Plans to colonize Mars so that we can start exploring the solar system. For the goal of it one day being a self sufficient colony. And if something bad happens on earth and we go extinct at least the human race might survive if ppl are on the moon, mars and potentially over on other planets too depending on when and if a catastrophe occurs.\n4. Actively promoting crypto and crypto adoption, which imo is also a good thing for humanity but I admit that that is subjective depending on each person's viewpoint on crypto.",
