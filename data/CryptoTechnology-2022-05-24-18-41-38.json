I am not so sure.",

Exchanges love bots, volume is volume, fees are fees regardless who places the orders hence they offer APIs for this.\n\nEach of these bots is a different strategy of automated earning. I could explain the basics of every one of them but unless you are particulary interested, i would just give some advice.\n\nDont trust bots on the internet, github, etc.\nIf a bot is that good, you wount see it out there and nobody will share their profits with you if they are indeed so peofitable.",

All trading, crypto or not, is full of bots now. There have been situations where whole markets crashed because of bots reacting to other bots in a feedback loop.\n\nThe point of a bot is if you have some idea for a trading strategy, but it would require you to spend all day watching and waiting for particular circumstances and then react very quickly, a bot is a way to use that strategy without putting in the work. Or to make decisions based on logic you believe in, but can't bring yourself to stick with because your emotions get the better of you. Having a bot doesn't mean the strategy is good or will make money though. Unless you are already able to be successful with trading and understand it really well there isn't much point in using a bot. Check out r/algotrading for people discussing what works and what realistic expectations might be.",
