            "selftext": "Since Binance is currently facing a lot of pressure from various governments to give up user data, I decided that my data is no longer safe with this company and wanted to delete my account. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's when I realized that they removed the option to delete the one's Binance account. Merely the option to disable your account is still available. This, however, merely restricts the access on the user level and has no effect on the storage of your data. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI messaged the support about this, but they didn't or couldn't answer my questions and kept referring me back to the 'disable account' option. Here is a screenshot of the chat with the support: [https://gyazo.com/b3cb3293ea2de01540c7da6dca732c89](https://gyazo.com/b3cb3293ea2de01540c7da6dca732c89)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not a legal expert, but I'm pretty sure that what they are doing is illegal and violates the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You can't just take away people's option to close their accounts without telling them beforehand. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt would be nice to know what the rest of the community thinks about this.",
