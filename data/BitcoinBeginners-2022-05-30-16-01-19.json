I am now at about 70-69% as my account is positive, but at what point should I repay or cash out? I gained enough now from something else to repay. If I repay I get to keep all the coins I bought on margin right? Any penalties for short term as I started it Sat night. Thanks for helping a noob \ud83d\ude0e",

Especially as it keeps dropping \u201crisk\u201d and value keeps increasing. Thanks and do you think crypto will crash again. Kind of feel it\u2019s time for the bull market to take charge",
