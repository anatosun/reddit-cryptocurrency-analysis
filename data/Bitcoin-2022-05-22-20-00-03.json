Other people lose/spend resources. So yes some will be scammed, which is definitely horrific and terrible. And they should get a hold on that. But the world doesn't stop spinning. fuji keeps putting water in bottles and people keep buying it. The person buying the water spends the money the person selling the water gets the money, and over time some people end up having more and some end up having less. And some get scammed, definitely the more you get scammed the harder it will be to accumulate a significant amount of resources, because of this, over time, resources appear to shift from less intelligent people to more intelligent people. Not because the intelligent people are scamming the less intelligent people, but because the intelligent people don't get scammed as much, and the less intelligent people keep getting scammed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo things persist. Resources persist. Money persists. Whether people are getting scammed for their gold or not, some people are accumulating more gold and becoming richer and some people are accumulating less gold and not increasing their resources at the same rate. But scamming doesn't mean gold just goes away. It only means those with enough money to secure their gold will do better. Or those with a clever enough strategy to secure their gold. And I don't argue that its somewhat dystopic. Yes it is mildly troubling. But thats life. 1 lion kills a antelope and maybe he turns his back and another lion takes it. That doesn't mean antelopes won't be a thing anymore. It just means the people who don't have their food stolen will have an easier time and that easier time will give them more flexibility and that flexibility, over the course of decades, will probably result in a life where more resources were accumulated than the other. Im speaking more proportionally of course.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe takeaway here is not take anyones antelope by the way. Its keep your eye on the prize. The antelope is symbolic, and scamming or dishonorable behavior is a gradient. People can legally screw you over. The takeaway is keep your eye on the prize.",
