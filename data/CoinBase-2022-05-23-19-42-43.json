I have 2 different cb wallets and i cannot connect my active wallet to uniswap because my other wallet is still connected. When i log into my new cb wallet and go to uniswap it still shows my previous wallet.  Wtf is going on w coinbase wallet.  Customer service is ridiculous.  Like how are these people getting paid to be Customer service when they don't know a damn think about ANYTHING coinbase related.  Everytime i call no one knows ANYTHING.  It's absolutely horrendous.  Get your shit together Coinbase!!!!!!",
