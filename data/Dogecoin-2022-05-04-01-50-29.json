NEVER listen to financial advice from anyone other than a professional financial advisor! That includes on reddits posts and comments. \n\n---\n\nEdit: The posts above can be edited any time by the people who wrote them. If you feel there is a serious error or mistake please send modmail and I will remove the post and ask the OP to sort it out.\n\n---\n\nEdit Edit.. This post was refreshed in April 2021, June and November. Once a post gets a few months old and reddit stops comments. We can't have that! I have rearranged the posts above in order of the last time they were updated so the most updated posts are at the top.\n\nWARNING. Do NOT fall for hype. Don't think you're going to get instantly rich. Don't trust random people offering financial advice. Cryptocurrency is the wild wild west of investing and many people want to take your money and run. You must 'educated' yourself with the good and the bad. You must understand what you're doing.",

While the points above are useful, I'd just like to add a reminder for those reading the comments that it's also not really good practice to go around encouraging others to buy constantly with overconfident price predictions. Better to just let people form their own evaluations of whether they should put some money in or not. Some people out there will believe random posts like that and buy in with FOMO; they are vulnerable to being hurt.

Fast and cheap transactions.\n\nYou use your dollar to buy stocks and have no problem with it not being dollars.\n\nYou can buy NFTs with doge. You can convert doge into any other asset that you want to invest in and when you're done with it, convert your profits back to doge. \n\nDo not look at doge like another crypto, look at doge like another dollar. \n\nYou use doge to buy things.

That's the whole point of a marketplace isn't it? \n\nEven an information marketplace.\n\nThe real sticking point here is who get's to define what type of content constitutes spam. \n\nI would suggest unlocking verified user status to only those people who link a crypto wallet address with at least 1 verified transaction on the BC. Obviously, the more seriously you wish to be taken on the platform the more you would have \"staked\" or literally invested to that ID. This should be public as it is a public square.\n\nCombine this semi anonymous ID with the current way Twitter already works. \n\nI theorize this could keep natural self edited global conversations with a high degree of community engagement while ensuring that bad-faith actors can be filtered based on a persistent but not inescapable ID linked to an actual investment of reputation in the form of DOGE.\n\nThose who Do Only Good Everyday will even potentially benefit through tips from users who seek to raise the profile of superior content generators.\n\n\nSome may be bad faith actors but we actually already have laws in most places prohibiting fraud, libel etc. Verified users who run afoul of these laws in whatever jurisdiction may have their accounts locked in that jurisdiction at the pleasure of whatever sovereign chooses to govern there but that all involved entities, plaintif, defendant, judge, jury, counsel, etc. would also risk their staked investment and credibility in the global information marketplace and begin to lose actual value they risked on their public credibility for overzealousness. \n\nThe difference is that only verified accounts may 'tip' using ideally DOGE which adds actual monetary value to those creating whatever type of content the community deems tippable rather than using nominally valueless concepts such as \"Likes\". \n\nThis removes the prevalence of false sanctimony/virtue signaling while maintaining a free and accessible forum for the exchange of ideas where real virtue can be rewarded and exchanged on/off the platform in exchange for whatever currency is most convenient for the person behind the account.\n\nI think this strikes a balance between personal security, public credibility, monetization for Twitter, ethical concerns, and information density. \n\nBut I'm just a DOGE \n\nARF ARF\n\n\nMUCH WOOOF\n\n\n\nwow",

The numbers are arbitrary, exact numbers should be tuned by game theory so there is no arbitrage.\n\nEDIT: This kind of mechanism is not likely to make things better, because it will turn microsocieties on the site into bubbles and censor opposing views, so, something like the failure reddit is.",

Fiat is 7% per year on average and has increased massively just recently. Dogecoin is literally quite similar to the supply of gold. It's in the midpoint of crypto supply rates - polkadot, solana, cosmos and many others - are all much higher 7-10% per year.\n\nCompare to everything else that exists.\n\nPrice is determined by buyers and sellers at any given time. You don't need to add 'x money' to move the price up 'x amount', or hold it there, you just need more buyers than sellers.\n\nIn an appreciating asset class, miners don't always sell their coins straight away. In bitcoin for example, a lot of the 'tops' have been sold off my miners holding onto coins. The first and 2nd top in 21, were both triggered by mining pools. They waited for maximum profits.   \n\n\nSo I wouldn't assume all coins are going straight into the market. In my estimation, by the time crypto slows it's rapid growth, dogecoin will be close to 2% which is economic growth (the amount of extra productivity each year).   \n\n\nAnd in any case, fiat is outpacing dogecoins supply anyway.",

IMO, doge never makes it as a GLOBAL currency without him.\n\nThere's too much competition w/in the crypto space, and Doge is not taken as a serious project by many. However, with it being accepted for Tesla merch, and potentially on Twitter for 100s of millions of users, people are starting to HAVE to take it seriously. (He accepts it directly too, ala Tesla merch, unlike these other companies that accept through Bitpay, which is not really accepting it).\n\nStrictly speaking, Billy and Jackson are the fathers of Dogecoin. Idc what people want to call Elon, but he has comtributed to the project and continues to do so... and I will heap praise (NOT WORSHIP, just praise) on anyone that does. Whether that's Elon, the devs, (Patrick, Michi, Ross, Timothy, etc.), foundation member's, meme-makers, small businesses that accept, pretty much anyone that contributes to it's success. I won't accept slander that attempts to minimize people's roles, which is what I feel these recent posts about Elon have been about. He is the most discussed person on this sub, but I think that is for good reason. The BIGGEST thing that's holding cryptocurrencies like Doge back rn is not development - it's adoption, and he's bringing that in force. Putting Doge leagues above other cryptos. \n\nTldr; it's mostly just a jumbled mess of a rant about why Elon is important to Dogecoin, especially right now.",

Give them a few dogecoin.\nMaybe you see an insightful post that helped you understand something better? Give them a few dogecoin.\nMaybe you see a charity you'd like to donate to.

I\u2019ve been holding since .0057 so accumulating at low cost isn\u2019t the actual concern. Better things to do with my 50k especially when I bonds have an interest rate above 8%.

If we want to go to the moon, the network must be active; we must buy, tip, and donate DOGE, and companies of all sizes must accept it.\n\nIf the DOGE drops in a natural process that is ok, I guess but having exchanges or whales shorting our coin, it is not cool.

            "selftext": "So once Twitter does the official announcement that Twitter is allowing tipping with Dogecoin, Dogecoin will start to climb to its new all-time high to 80 cents. During the climb, it's going to spark Mass adoption from all the other social media platforms, dating websites, and other apps, for example OfferUp tinder plenty of fish and others.\n\nFacebook will even give up on their s*** coin that they're making and will submit to dogecoins charm. Once all the other platforms adopt crypto people will see how important cryptocurrency is and we will see the crypto market cap climb. \n\nThink about it, the whole world is not trading crypto right now. We just need that one little spark that's going to have all the apps and all the platforms feeling obligated to make a cryptocurrency option for their payments for anything when it comes to tipping paying for memberships all that.\n\nI say it's going to take about 6 to 8 months for this whole Dogecoin tipping to come through. Also I have a crazy wild prediction that if the power starts going out in America and other countries, starlink will be there to help make transactions possible still if need be and make Dogecoin even more popular. \n\nTherefore I am super bullish on Dogecoin and we have a legitimate use case, speed, and cheap transactions. Good luck ladies and gentlemen, buckle up your seat belts because we will be getting to a dollar but first I believe we're going to hit 80 cents. After that, will crab and eventually hit $10 once all the platforms adopt it.",

Robinhood wasn\u2019t the only one that halted trading. Without getting into it the SEC requires a certain amount of cash on hand during trading. When trading increases cash reserves need to increase and when trade slows most brokerages want to invest that money to earn more. Robinhood along with the majority of the other major brokerages didn\u2019t foresee the flood of people jumping into GME and didn\u2019t have enough cash reserves to maintain the increasing amount of trades happening with GME or other meme stocks. And because they couldn\u2019t maintain the cash reserves required by the SEC they had to halt trading to come up with the money. So if you really want to be upset about it you should be upset with the SEC and not the brokerages as they were just following the SEC rules.",

The insanity hasn't even begun.  I suggest go out and purchase some big boy pants, cause it's not going to get any better.  You need to be selective about what you digest from the sub. Try and be the change you want to see.  You can make 8 non-Elon posts per day.  If just 5 or 10 of you non-fans did this, it would go along way in balancing the content.  Ever think of that? Come on shibe!  Even Elon fans get sick of all the reposts/redundant Elon stuff... Be the solution.",

When driving away from home, Russian soldiers stopped us on a small road in a rural area. They demanded us to give all our electronic devices etc. They were all in a backpack, as well as my cold wallet. We were scared as hell so gave everything in a heartbeat.\n\nIn the beginning of the war, I used about 90% of my real money to buy crypto (mainly USDT but also a little bit BTC). I did it to prevent it from a possible hyperflation from the Ukrainian hryvnia and possible theft. I placed all on a Legder Nano S to keep it safe.\n\nThe most important thing is we are still alive but I'm desperate about my money. It was about 30k USDT and 5k in BTC. The chances I got to see my cold wallet back are 0%. Is there any other way I can access my USDT and BTC? When the war is over I've got nothing anymore.\n\nSorry for possible bad English, it's not my main language.",

Period.\n\nGo to any of these xyz token forums and you'll see speculators and traders whine about utility, demanding devs add more utility just so they can keep gambling on those useless tokens and feed on their hype addiction. \n\n\"Go make more convoluted utility to feed the hype (and hopefully I can sell on the pump)\".\n\nThere is already pDoge and RenDoge that exists.

Assuming you\u2019re on a current version, the DUMPWALLET command will do that for you. Then go into the resulting text file and add comments for the wallets with coins in them. You can ignore reserve wallets for now. Just use them as required later.\n\nThis file and a local copy of coinb.in is all you need. Put them on removable media, make copies, and store them in safe places so they don\u2019t all get destroyed in a disaster.\n\nThen you can pick one wallet, with a suitable amount of coins, and copy it to your mobile device. I have one with about ten bucks in it in Notes on my iPhone for example. If you do use an iPhone, you won\u2019t be able to run a local copy of a website, so you\u2019ll need to use the live site, but the risk is low with only a few bucks at stake.\n\nYou could also import this wallet into a client if you really want to. I wouldn\u2019t, for several reasons. Foremost is that clients will send change to new wallets and not tell you. That\u2019s what all those change wallets in Core are, and why there are a hundred reserves.",

This sparked an alt run for those experiencing fomo of bitcoin gains. The timing was perfect, and I dare say planned by Elon or others to coincide. Doge may have only topped out at 10-40 cents naturally, but the elon effect and snl exposure arguably boosted it much higher. Doge has also been a top 3 crypto prior to SNL, during the 2017 bullring. It's no wonder Elon attached himself to it when it was back in the top 40-50 trading under a penny during a cryptobullring that had just started ramping up.\n\nEdit: autocorrected bullrun to bullring, leaving it \ud83d\ude06",

It blows my mind that people hate dogecoin and we have so many people against something so good. \n\n  Just wanted to share and say I will never be posting for moons and contribute more and more to this page.

Back in 2020 when Doge really hit big, we, as a community put forth effort to buy Doge and help raise its price as a #1 internet currency. We talked about holding and p were proud to show how much they had, then when Doge hit .50 and higher, all I started seeing was \u201cbought my lambo or finally got me this.\u201d Basically, it was a show off on how people sold their Doge and spent the paper money instead of hodling like they were preaching. This right here is a prime example of what happened back then. Try hodling from .02 or less and have kept it that way until we\u2019ll after the .75 cent peak. Not gonna happen because a vast mofority of the ppl here are just paper hands!",

We have seen alternatives pop up and they never gain enough traction to be anywhere close to competitive. People believe that because of this, these platforms should be protected under the first ammendment. And to be frank, I would have to agree with them to a certain degree.

And if things go wrong, there is absolutely nothing to recover.\n\nWhen a company fails, there are assets. Cash. Stock. Buildings. Vehicles. Furniture. And companies generate cash flows and profits.\n\nCrypto does none of that. And values are completely ethereal, based on peoples\u2019 sentiments. Like the current spike caused by something that has absolutely nothing to do with us.\n\nSo, sure, get some Doge. Use it. It\u2019s a currency after all. And trade it. Because the skills trading Doge will teach you are fully transferable to any other kind of trading. Cheapest education possible, since you can play with as little as a dollar.\n\nBut don\u2019t for a moment think you\u2019re \u2018investing\u2019. And definitely don\u2019t take your eyes off the ball, because it will bite you.\n\nCase in point, I went to my postbox yesterday, for the first time in months thanks to lockdowns and so on (it\u2019s half an hour away from me). Last night I opened all the letters and pulled out a couple hundred bucks worth of dividend cheques and notices. Two payments from some of the companies, so it\u2019s been ages since I\u2019d done this, clearly.\n\nI would NEVER ignore my crypto holdings for six months like this. Because you can\u2019t just set and forget like you can with shares, or gold, or anything else. This is an active, volatile space. Either you\u2019re in it, or you\u2019re not.

See details below on how you can track this information. Obviously big news with Elon and Twitter - but this is the best way to catch these moves\n\n**Tracking Mechanics**\n\n* The algorithm pulls data from multiple social platforms. For Twitter, we use the Twitter API. It looks at tweets, comments, likes, and impressions.\n* The change in these metrics is displayed as well as the underlying posts that feed the dashboard, so you can drill into the individual tweets for transparency and sentiment purposes.\n* There is also tracking for Reddit and Stocktwits - though Twitter usually has the largest reach.\n\n**Trending Overview** \\- Change in Tweets, Comments, Likes, and Impressions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/042mp3p0trv81.png?width=1469&format=png&auto=webp&s=53c70a03b8e591b75ec54ab57a9d4a2e316aa89d\n\nHopefully, you find this useful.

DOGE.   Psst: The Musk man is deep in Stripe. How come you all don't know that tid bit? Casey didn't even seem to know.  \n\nMusk likes DOGE. Musk is invested in Stripe. Musk bought Twitter. Stripe/Twitter announce embedding payment systems. Musk has been talking monetizing Twitter and sell Validation \u2705\u2705 check marks and subscriptions services.  Sounds like we may pay 5, 10, 100 DOGE to get us on Musk's Twitter, soon?   \n\nDOGE NEEDS REAL WORLD USE.  MUSK is building real world use.\n\nWhat are you doing?  Me? I'm thinking.

It was created by Jackson Palmer and Billy Marcus in November 2013. Billy Marcus claims that the coin was built in about 2 hours.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Dogecoin has one of the biggest and most responsive community support in the crypto space.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Elon Musk called himself the dogefather. In May 2021, he also tweeted that SpaceX will launch satellite Doge-1 to the moon in the upcoming year. It will make Doge the 1st crypto in space and the 1st meme in space. The mission will be paid in Doge.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Snoop Dog is also a big Dogecoin supporter. Snoop Doge, you might say.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Dogecoin has an unlimited supply of coins. Dogecoin is Cheap. Transactions are cheap, and that attracts a lot of new Doge users.\n\n\ud83d\udccc 2.6 % of payments on CoinGate are made via Dogecoin, and it's the 7th most popular crypto in our services.\n\nWhich is your favorite dogecoin fact?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4d7zd6jkg9x81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e130aac90b2132aa2e82da464da830463c79bbb",

All of the mining was handled in browser or with an desktop app. You used to get paid weekly and they would put your earning on the wallet website which you could also cash out to another wallet or anytime.\n\nFor the life of me I can't find the site or any mention of it on forums etc. The ui was super intuitive as well with a neat night mode. Any chance anyone remember this site? \n\nMuch love. Do only good everyday peeps!",

For example, each month I would have buckets of cash for the month, and rather than leaving it in the bank I would \"store\" it in dogecoin and withdraw when I needed the cash, using the peoples crypto as I think it should be used - as a currency.\n\n9 times out of 10, when I've withdrawn the crypto I've always withdrawn some profit.\n\nI hope you've all had a lovely day / continue to have a lovely day, I look forward to speaking to you all again.",

            "selftext": "Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, has been tweeting on how to deal with the platform's spam bot problem. He has stated that he will \"attempt\" to fix the spam problem. Last week, Twitter agreed to sell the firm to Musk for $44 billion. \n\nMark Cuban, an American billionaire entrepreneur, made one recommendation. He is the owner of the NBA franchise Dallas Mavericks and a celebrity on the business reality television show Shark Tank. \n\nCuban urged that everyone put up one dogecoin (DOGE) for unlimited tweets on Twitter in a tweet early Sunday morning. If a human certifies that a post is spam, the person who flagged it gets the spammer's DOGE. He went on to say that spammers must post 100 times as much dogecoin. However, if the post is not spam, the flagger loses his dogecoin.\n\nAt the time of writing, Cuban\u2019s tweet has been liked more than 9K times. Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus said, \u201cI like this.\u201d Musk replied, \u201cNot a bad idea.\u201d\n\n\nMany advocates of Dogecoin believe Cuban's suggestion is a smart one, noting that it is quite bullish for DOGE. Some people, however, are suspicious of its viability, questioning the obligation to begin paying for what is presently a free service and compelling consumers to use the meme money as collateral to avoid spamming. \n\nSome people mentioned the issue of unethical users profiting from the system. \"Nah,\" one Twitter user responded to Cuban. You didn't consider everything. How do you handle dishonest actors flagging spam that isn't spam and humans confirming it is spam just to get the'spammers' dog coin?\" \n\nTesla's CEO has vowed that Twitter will see \"major changes.\" He called crypto spam bots the \u201csingle most annoying problem on Twitter.\u201d Prior to the social media giant accepting his buyout offer, he said if his Twitter bid succeeds, he \u201cwill defeat the spam bots or die trying.\u201d\n\nBoth Musk and Cuban have been pro-dogecoin. Musk is often called the Dogefather. In August last year, the two said that dogecoin is the \u201cstrongest\u201d cryptocurrency for payment surprisingly over Ethereum which fuels many projects including green efficient projects like Hydrominer, Cycled and Nature Vault. Cuban\u2019s NBA team, the Dallas Mavericks, accepts DOGE for merchandise and the Shark Tank star has also been encouraging people to get into crypto via dogecoin.",
