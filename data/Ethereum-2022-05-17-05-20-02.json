B3 aims to offer national crypto exchanges a myriad of services.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.*",

You need someone who knows what they are talking about, someone who can inform others. \nYou might have said earlier that you can buy from the crypto ATMs. Crypto dispensers are not the way this will be trusted by a community.

There are just too many of them and each of them is just too small of a scam to be worth an article. Besides, scammed people feel too much more ashamed than angry to tell the tale on public with a journalist. \n\nWith crypto, all scams are public by default. You don't need people to tell you anything about it. \n\n>Where do you usually go to get a loan, or pull money from your account. Your bank. It has a location, people inside. It is real.\n\nI can retrieve money without getting to any place, even with a bank. \n\nI can even have a credit card and spend cryptocurrencies using it to pay people who want fiat. \n\nLet's be clear: crypto doesn't need people. Some people need crypto, nothing more. Once people will see the benefits, they will use it. No need to force adoption or anything: it's not a Ponzi. If people want to make sure they don't interact with crypto, it's their loss, not yours.\n\nFor those who are interested about crypto, there already are physical events where it's talked about, where there are \"salesmen\", even though it's more about awareness than it is about selling something. It's not a company with products (though some companies are doing exactly that, but they're not building about decentralization anyway, by design).",
