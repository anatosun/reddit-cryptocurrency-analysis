            "selftext": "My case support number is 12005676.  I understand that according to Coinbase that it takes three to five business days once a payment has been processed and received for approval of restrictions to be lifted on an account, and the reason there's an added wait time on top of the wait of having your payment transactions processed is done for no other reason than to sociopathically inconvenience and infuriate every unfortunate soul that becomes a victim to this crap.\n\nYou guys received your money. I've been using Coinbase Pro for over two years now, and the first time I use your Instant USD deposit that is anything but instant, the transactions get rejected by my bank despite me having enough money in my account to cover the deposit, and I get these arbitrarily indefinite restrictions on my account. I paid one payment I owed Coinbase and the other with USD. I know for a fact that both of them have been paid and the USD payment was debited from my checking account last night.\n\n Please don't make me go through this nightmare where you tell me you will stop holding my money hostage I'm three to five days and then entire weeks go by without anything being resolved. \n\nI don't understand why you guys simply receiving the money I \"owed\" you isn't good enough to give me access to my cryptocurrency again. Why does there have to be a three to five day approval process? You got your money, it has officially been processed and debited, now stop holding my money hostage you have no moral right to be doing what you guys are doing!",

The two transactions were for $10 and $60. I paid the $60 I owed to Coinbase with my Bitcoin balance, and I paid the $10 with USD from my bank. I saw in my online account history that $10 was debited some time yesterday to Coinbase, so I now know for a fact I have paid off what I owe in order to have the restrictions on buying, selling, converting, and withdrawing lifted from my account, but for some reason the restrictions are still there despite Coinbase having officially received the payments.",
