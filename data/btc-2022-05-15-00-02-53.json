How many projects depend on the price of BTC for their success? Arguably none. It seems manipulated- maybe there\u2019s some way to leverage different coins against each other so they have a tendency to move with BTC? Or maybe the top 50 coins are all more manipulated than we know. The entire marketcap of these tokens is pretty small. Probably easier to rig crypto markets than traditional ones.",

Large, mid, small caps and then by use(privacy based coins for example). This is similar to how stocks move within the market as well...certain sectors strong while others are weak and cycling through under and overvalued relative to each other.\n\nFor the most part, these coins are priced in USD, so X/USD being the fraction. You have the individual coin's worth/USD...meanwhile USD can move up or down in strength which can impact movement though USD is more stable in value than the coins for the most part. \n\nSo BCH can move with it's own behavior if there are factors that lead it's  valuation to change in the midst of a market wide move. This type of logic can be used when looking at charts of X/BTC compared to X/USD. Say BTCUSD is moving up, as is the rest of the crypto market. You can look at the X/BTC pairings and through analysis..see which crypto coins are stronger or weaker relative to BTC. So if BTCUSD is pumping along with BCHUSD, but BCHBTC is pumping, that would mean that BCH would be the stronger asset at the moment. Can be used in relative value analysis as well. \n\nDoes that make sense?",

If a bunch of scammers chose to fork it (&/or support the fork), then that just set back its development as cash by several years. LN etc is merely delaying the inevitable. If BCH can't be supported as a speculative **SOV**, then it should die, so that big-blockers can get back to work on turning the real Bitcoin into cash. There's a chance of smartBCH becoming a massive scam, and bringing BCH down with it (financial suicide may be a better option).",
