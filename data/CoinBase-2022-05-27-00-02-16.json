I have about $180 eth in the wallet...should be enough to cover miner fees.  Any advice? Is it solar flares? Is there a coin that yeilds high enough miner fees to make it worth it? Are they just putting it low in cue cause the transfer isn't worth it ?",

Usually once you\u2019ve added cash from a linked bank account, those funds are immediately available for buying and selling on Coinbase. However, due to security reasons, you will not be able to immediately cash out or send these funds, or use them to make a payment with your Coinbase Card. If you need more detailed information on your card limits and spending delays please file a case at: https://help.coinbase.com/en/contact-us/ and our email support will assist you further. Thank you.",
