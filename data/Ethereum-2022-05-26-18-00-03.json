Otherwise if he screws up through no fault of your own you'll be on the hook for some of the slashing penalty.\n\nBeen a while since I read up on why there needed to be a pool participant with 16 Ether, though, I might be misremembering. The other pool members can contribute smaller portions of the stake, though presumably won't be getting as big a percentage of the rewards as the 16 Ether contributor since they're not risking as much or doing the actual work of running a validator.",

At some point the coordination overhead gets problematic.\n\nHaving validators \"fall asleep\" and keeping only a defined set active would avoid the problem. E.g. 1/4 validator would only need 8 ETH and be active 25% of the time.\n\nHowever, I do not see such an upgrade in the near (1-2 years) future, since it is not mission critical and the bare necessities already eat up all the development time.",
