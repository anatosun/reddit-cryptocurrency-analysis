Make sure you writedown exactly what you input (case sensitive and spaces do matter)\n\nThan you will want to store your backups in this manner -\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/g42ijd/faq_for_beginners/fouo3kh/\n\n\nDone\n\nIf this is too complicated for you than just buy a 60 dollar trezor one",

While I'm a reasonably competent developer, I don't have a formal computer science education. \n\nI've become fascinated (obsessed, really) with bitcoin over the last year and I'd like to dedicate the time to understanding it as deeply as I can. This means learning some of the fundamental aspects of the technology like cryptography and distributed systems, but going back to school isn't something I'm interested in. I've got the time to learn, I just don't really know where to start or what to focus on.\n\nI do have a copy of Jimmy Song's book \"Programming Bitcoin\" and I'm a few chapters deep and enjoying it a lot. Are there any other technical resources anyone can recommend? Any tips on how to best spend my study time? \n\nIdeally, I'd like to be able to understand the details of the latest BIPs, what the core devs are doing, and generally be as informed as I can to become a better steward of the network. Maybe in a perfect world I'd land a job in the space one day.",
