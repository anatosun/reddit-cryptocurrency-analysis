I get to part where I generated the keys to 3 wallets and have to connect to a wallet with 96 testnet eth. I went to the suggested faucet and was only able to get 6.25 testnet eth. Other faucets offer 0.05. Surely there is an easier way? There are now 300k+ mainnet validators .... Did they all through weeks/months of waiting to access the testnet?",

Not sure about getting three funded though\u2026.",
