You can reuse any of your old addresses (they are all yours forever).  The other advantage is nobody can use your addresses to see your balance.  \n\nHowever as they say \u201cNot your keys not your crypto\u201d so technically Coinbase has your money. If you moved to your wallet it\u2019s harder to hide IMHO (not anonymity) but assets because someone can just look at your address and see how much you have and try to track what you do even though they might not know who you are.  \n\nPros and cons for each (exchange/custodial wallet vs non-custodial wallet) with regard to privacy.",
