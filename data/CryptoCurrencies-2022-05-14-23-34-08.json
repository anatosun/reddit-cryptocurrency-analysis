It seems that it all started when the stablecoin or stable cryptocurrency Luna suffered a big shock that affected TerraUSD and spread to all digital currencies. \n\nThe best known, Bitcoin, was also affected. In about 24 hours, more than 200 billion dollars were lost and many people lost everything they had invested. Panic set in among investors.\n\nHowever, to say or assert that this market is a 'money loser' or that a 'crisis' is looming is a totally wrong statement. For despite all the red panaroma, the blockchain world and development does not stop and continues to receive countless amounts of money, as is the case of Ethereum 2.0 who is still standing on the blockchain development, Solana in its technological race with the aforementioned, Zetrix in the implementation of the cross blockchian or Terra in the race for its ecosystem.\n\nThis week, Bitcoin fell below $28,000 and Ethereum (ETH) lost the $1,800 level, down about 60% from the November 2021 highs, and the tenth major correction in the last decade.\n\nBut can a crash in cryptocurrencies turn into a financial crisis? Currently, the market capitalization of the entire cryptoasset class is $1.3 trillion, which is equivalent to less than 1% of the global bond or equity markets. \nThis market marked its highs in November 2021, close to $3 trillion, but the volatility that has set in this 2022 has caused it to lose about $1.7 trillion.",

It could easily be ballooned into the 10s of trillions of dollars.\n\nAnd that's not even considered cascading leverage failures and margin calls.\n\nSo yeah, crypto could absolutely cause a financial crisis if it cascades into something larger. My bet is that tether blows up first, which provided that it makes up 60% of BTC volume, will blow up bitcoin, which will in turn blow up the entire crypto ecosystem. All the hedge funds leveraged 25:1 on the crypto space blow up next, and all the hedge funds invested in those other hedge funds blow up next, and then the banks blow up, and boom. Full blown financial crisis.",

You\u2019re most probably using Linux right now cause almost 85% of all smartphones are based on Linus and around 96% of the top 1,000,000 servers in the world run on Linux.\n\nWhat this means exactly is that Cartesi might be one of the top contenders in the crypto market to make it to the mainstream.\n\nHaving an engine that operates on Linux will give developers the opportunity to builds crypto dApps on Linux for the first time and give Cartesi (along with the rest of the crypto market) a ton of exposure.\n\nThis alone, in my opinion, is exactly why I think Cartesi is so underrated right now and is bound for a huge pump pretty soon.",

But on Bittrex i only got around 5k Coins which would be around 2 Dollars worth on any other exchange. Is there something i simply dont understand?",
