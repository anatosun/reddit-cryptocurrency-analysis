For instance, NFT major OpenSea smashed through 1,5 million active users milestone in late Q1, 2022.\n\n**Move-to-Earn**\n\nWith the hype around Stepn (GMT), the euphoria of Move-to-Earn products took over the markets. Move-to-Earn refers to a class of products that compensates users for their physical activity; running, doing yoga, jogging, and so on. Such applications have very low entry barriers: no previous cryptocurrency experience is required to start earning passive income with Move-to-Earn.\n\nTechnically, Move-to-Earn is all about microtransactions. In the segment, dApps need to send their users thousands of small transactions in a lightning-fast manner to ensure fair, inclusive and democratic participation.\n\n**SocialFi**\n\nWhat [DeFis](https://getblock.io/blog/decentralized-finances-def-explained-shortest-manual-you-will-ever-find/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) made for banks, SocialFi applications are going to make for social media platforms. Through a set of blockchain-based instruments, SocialFi apps allow users to monetize their content, interact with each other, and earn crypto through marketing integrations.\n\nAlso, SocialFi applications are going to address major censorship and centralization issues that plagued Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nJust like Move-to-Earn protocols, SocialFi apps prioritize microtransactions: they serve as a crypto-backed analogs of likes and upvotes. Also, SocialFi apps should be flexible and adjustable.\n\n[Source](https://getblock.io/blog/getblock-offers-baas-infrastructure-for-all-major-trends-of-2022-details/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo)\n\nAre there any missed out that you would add?",
