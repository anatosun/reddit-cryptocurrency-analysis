Russia is a sufficiently large economy that they will be able to do that, and solve the problem once and for all, for everyone else too.\n\nTherefore, I suspect that one important long-term consequence of the war in the Ukraine will be that the entire sanctions regime will totally collapse and become completely unusable.",

Wel, I guess business is booming and he is not obliged to care.",

Every crypto tool claims that it\u2019s easy to use but it\u2019s not the truth. I used CoinTracker and TaxBit before moving on to Cointelli. Both tools were calculating my gains differently. That was really frustrating. I was asking for recommendations from my friends and one of my colleagues suggested I should try Cointelli. I did research about it before jumping into it. I was hesitant to use it because I\u2019d never heard of it before. I shared the problems via e-mail that I was facing with other tools about how they can help me with that. I was impressed when Cointelli\u2019s cofounder responded to me and then I got to know that actually, he is the one who directly deals with customers' issues. He guided me through it (I\u2019m not sharing the details it could get boring). I used it for free to see if I can get my calculations right. And luckily I did ad then I bought their package to download my report. \n\nIt was a roller coaster ride but finally, it\u2019s over. Hope it could help you guys next season. Which tool do you find the best, share your thoughts? I want to see if there\u2019s a better option than Cointelli. I would love to explore.",

Also, has a lot of blogs to support your understanding of everything in regard to crypto taxes\n\n\\- Supports the widest range of exchanges\n\n\\- Easiest imports with the least amount of errors\n\nHope this helps",

I just send her w-2s and all of our income stuff, All of my retirement accounts and stock sales, and then crypto on top of that. It would probably take me 2-4 hours at least to do my taxes myself with all I have and even then I wouldn't have confidence that I wasn't messing something up. She also is finding me tax loopholes as much as possible and finding write offs for me and reducing my tax burden overall. \n\n$550 so I don't have 4 hours worth of work is well worth the price for me. \n\n>What's the guarantee that CPA will not do any mistake.\n\nI have a contract with her that as long as I do not falsify records and as long as I give her everything that I know exists, she provides audit protection and her firm will come out of pocket for any damages or mistakes she makes while filing.\n\nGot my taxes back probably three or four weeks ago now.

Also if you don't have as much activity on cryptocurrency, stocks or what have you then your taxes are simpler anyways so you wouldn't necessarily need a CPA. \n\nI just assumed that you were needing a cryptocurrency tax program because you were making a lot of cryptocurrency moves and therefore had a bunch of capital gains as well. I always try to account for my tax burden for the next year which includes my tax preparation fees when I'm deciding if I'm using any money from my capital gains in the first place. Basically remember to set aside money for Uncle Sam when you make any sales. CPA fee is the cost of doing business, but yeah $550 isn't anything I'm missing relative to my income.",
