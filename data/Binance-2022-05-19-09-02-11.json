So it usually spreads really quickly near schools, and I\u2019ve had friends (quarantined for exposure) not following quarantine rules cuz their phones aren\u2019t tracked, so they could technically go outside without punishment.\n\nAnother problem why cases are so high is cuz for the first 2 years, the cases here have always stayed in the double digits, so it makes lots of sense for an outbreak to happen now. \n\nAlso, my trader friend who does TA a few weeks back did joke about cases potentially breaking out pretty soon, ofc I didn\u2019t think it was possible because of rising gas prices, but what\u2019s crazy is that the economy here has been roaring for the past 5 years. But now are spending a lot more than last year because of the stimulus checks (not anymore tho).\n\n*well at least I\u2019ve been getting a 15% every year and mcdonalds meals here have stayed the same for a long time now, so inflation isn\u2019t an issue here*",
