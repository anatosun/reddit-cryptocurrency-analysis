In a recent conversation with Time magazine, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, stated that Dogecoin is a far superior cryptocurrency in daily transactions.\n\nIn the middle of the massive decline in the price of Terra, Elon Musk, the most renowned crypto influencer for a few cryptocurrencies, has said that he will assist in renewing the price of a memecoin, Dogecoin. Due to the red signals in the cryptocurrency market, crypto investors are extremely tense. With the support of Elon Musk, Dogecoin may be able to enhance its price as a memecoin.\n\nDogecoin was created as a memecoin to mock the most popular cryptocurrencies. However, it has become a popular cryptocurrency because of its innovative features. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and the most recent owner of Twitter, is a key crypto influencer and a proponent of Dogecoin in the cryptocurrency industry. He is recognised for using the Musk effect to impact the masses with his cryptic tweets.\n\nShareholders in Dogecoin have begun to rely on Elon Musk to allow the cryptocurrency to be traded on Twitter. Elon Musk said during the Terra crash that Dogecoin, as a meme coin, still has the potential to be a powerful cryptocurrency. Several cryptocurrencies, such as Faith Tribe, Threedium, Metaloop, MetaTokyo, and others, can be collateral for cash loans.",
