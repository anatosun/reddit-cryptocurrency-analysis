Nevermind, it's a rhetorical question. LN doesn't scale except with big hubs. Which will be run by banks or the equivalent. Of course they consider they should earn the fees and not the miners who secure the foundation.",

If customer A is cashing a check at teller X, but teller X has insufficient cash in her drawer, teller X can get it from teller Y, etc.  Cash on hand is fungible throughout the bank, all tellers can use it.  Reserve funds (whether 100% or fractional) are not dedicated to individual user accounts or tellers).  However, there are more complicated banking situations, starting with branch banks and reserve banking, where some of the liquidity problems do indeed resemble LN rebalancing issues.  Decades ago I recall a conversation with my Uncle who was CFO of a large Philadelphia bank where he talked about sending checks by helicopter each night to the Fed in New York.   \n\nBitcoin prevents hidden inflation by blockchain transparency.

If a node is offline by accident or censors you (you can't distinguish the two), it won't be included in the payment route (a single payment is routed via multiple channels at once). If a node is offline for longer periods of time, your wallet will close channels with that node and move the funds to your other channels or open new ones to more reliable nodes (who will earn fees instead).\n\n> 51% of LN liquidity will suck mining fees out of BTC in an ever increasing amount until the LN liquidity owners take over (buy up) the hashrate majority. BOOM. Mission accomplished. So why should the LN operators earn the fees. Nevermind, it's a rhetorical question. LN doesn't scale except with big hubs. Which will be run by banks or the equivalent. Of course they consider they should earn the fees and not the miners who secure the foundation.\n\nYou lost me here. You want miners running massive mining operations to earn fees, but you don't want miners who are also LN node operators to earn fees too?",

Nothing breaks [...].\n\nCorrect. On LN a \"censoring\" node is indistinguishable from one being offline. Your wallet will ignore offline/unreliable nodes while routing payments and remove them over time, moving funds to your other channels. The \"victim\" does not know or care.\n\n> You can't effectively censor anything with 51% hashrate. Or even 80%. As soon as you start orphaning uncensored blocks, the entire network will be aware of your attack invalidate your blocks and fork you right the fuck off.

Your only remedy is to change the mining algo. No big deal.\n\nSo your hashrate attack scenario affects every user, involves massive coordination, manual invalidation of individual blocks and a change of the mining algo. The LN liquidity attack on the other hand is not noticeable by most, hurts the attackers (they lose out on fees), incentivizes circumvention (those who provide online channels will earn the fees instead) and the process is already automated by some wallets.",

There are lots of technical areas in a software client that need improvement to unlock the additional capacity. From storage, to network protocols etc.\n\nOn BCH we have active research on those scaling areas and are actually testing larger block sizes (256MB, 1GB) to find bottlenecks etc. I'd love you to point me at discussion of similar tests on XMR.\n\nOn BCH we also know that scaling isn't simply a matter of the protocol, it's the network around it too:\n\nhttps://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/assessing-the-scaling-performance-of-several-categories-of-bch-network-software/754",
