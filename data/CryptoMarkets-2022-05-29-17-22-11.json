Earn **Gemz** ([BattleMechs price today, GEMZ to USD live, marketcap and chart | CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/battlemechs/)) while playing the game. It is based on the Zilliqa blockchain [r/Zilliqa](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zilliqa/) ([Zilliqa price today, ZIL to USD live, marketcap and chart | CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zilliqa/))\n\nWhitepaper: [https://whitepaper.battlemechs.co/](https://whitepaper.battlemechs.co/)\n\nBattleMechs is a revolutionary play-to-earn blockchain game bridging the gap between mobile gaming and crypto. Via a custom build software development kit for the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/), BattleMechs creates a smooth user-experience akin to traditional mobile games.\n\nBattleMechs has integrated with the [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/854415cf3d214371a7b60cf01ead0918) and [Zilliqa blockchain](https://zilliqa.com/). Upon starting the mobile app players are automatically generated a Zilliqa and Ethereum wallet. There are no requirements to use additional blockchain wallets and or extentions such as Metamask or Trust Wallet.\n\nHaving all blockchain related wallets and transactions directly managed from within the BattleMechs app allows for a traditional mobile gaming experience, in addition to making the process of interacting with the blockchain a lot more approachable for non-technical users. Powered by [BLOX-SDK.com](https://blox-sdk.com/) .\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 Play-for-free, no deposit required  \n\ud83d\udcf7 Earn rare NFT loot and $GEMZ by mining\n\nPowered by **Zilliqa** and BLOX-SDK\n\nIt's on Google play store currently, not available on iOS as of yet.\n\n**If you use my code**: **Memz** you get free 10 GEMZ in-game, here it is: [BattleMechs](https://battlemechs.co/referral?code=memz)\n\nEdit: It is currently still in development, but the game allows you to mine ever 6 hours and everytime you complete it, you earn 2 Gemz. Which equals to $1.30 every 6 hours of mining. Which I think is amazing. So potentially you're looking at $5 daily earning without even doing anything.\n\nEnjoy!",
