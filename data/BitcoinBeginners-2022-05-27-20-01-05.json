I did notice that service was unavailable at certain times when shit was going down with the market. \n\nAs to Kraken I've had no issues at all and remember the CEO tweeting about how govts could and would force them to limit transactions and to beware (this was at during the controversy about crypto being availble to Russian citizens). Which is either very good PR or just integrity given that you would expect such an admission could hurt his business. I think I trust Kraken.",
