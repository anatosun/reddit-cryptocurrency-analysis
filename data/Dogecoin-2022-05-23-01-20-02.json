They are all crypto experts off of Reddit who get all of their news from either this platform or yahoo news, until I ask them: What do you do if somebody hands you a stack of $100 bills? \u201cPut it in my bank obviously!\u201d Okay true. Now what happens if someone hands you a huge stack ($100,000) of dogecoin? They ALL said \u201cI\u2019d trade it!\u201d Why? Because crypto is meant to be traded. You all hold and buy and buy and expect the price to sky rocket but that\u2019s not how this works. If you love something then let it go so it can grow and come back, that\u2019s what this is all about. Want Doge to hit $1? Trade it\u2026 CRYPTO IS MEANT TO BE TRADED, NOT HOARDED. Thank you all for your time.",
