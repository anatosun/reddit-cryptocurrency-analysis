Small businesses that are struggling to make ends meet, not big depersonalized financial capital. This is what inspired me. This is my dream.\n\nIn the eyes of the original broad community vision, the tools of a cryptocurrency should allow people to do economic activity whatever the business size, geographic location, or interest rates set by big players.\n\nThe tools should allow people to make contracts (digital, self-enforcing, reasonable smart contracts) regardless of the differences in jurisdictions, traditions, followed business practices, etc.\n\nI hope Ergo will be helpful here. Thousands of small cooperatives and individual entrepreneurs are much more critical to healthy and sustainable wealth growth around the globe compared to a couple of corporations hiding profits in offshore heavens.\n\nLet's consider the use and integration with communities, cooperative federations, nonprofit foundations, and philanthropic trusts.\u00a0\n\nLet's try to create grassroots finance.\u00a0\n\nYes, many other things can be built, but I think my goal should not be forgotten. Smart contracts that help create value and protect the common people\n\nRead more at\nhttps://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/",
