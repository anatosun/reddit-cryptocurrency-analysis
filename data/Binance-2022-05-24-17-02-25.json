BSC projects were absolutely massive in 2021. But it was also a haven for rugs and scams, so I feel like people may have slowly pulled away from the platform and started looking at other networks/coins.\n\nI'm not saying BNB is anywhere near dying or dead. No way whatsoever. I'm just unsure about explosive growth after the shit storm that was 2021 on the BSC network. But that's what company strategies and road maps are for. So as long as Binance push for growth and utility on BSC, as well as controlled burning, the price should/could theoretically keep going.",
