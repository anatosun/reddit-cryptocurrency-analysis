There's no better business model than earning profit off other people's money!\n\nBut when the market turns and your investments start to lose money ... well, now you've lost other people's money, and they're going to be pissed if they find out.  So now you have two choices: 1) come clean, declare bankruptcy, close the business, return what you can to investors, and maybe go to prison; or 2) start dancing and singing and trying to distract people from the truth and hope either the market turns or you can get your fake identities established and move enough assets to numbered accounts somewhere to spend the rest of your life hiding on a tropical beach.",
