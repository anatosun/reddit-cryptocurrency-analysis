How would they \u201credeem\u201d their own supply, exactly?\n\nDo you think Tether owns a bunch of their own coins and is \u201cdestroying\u201d them and taking the real assets off the balance sheet?   i.e. doing what any other coin holder would do?\n\nOr is Tether actively using their reserve assets to buy back their own coins?  Which would be exactly what happens if an investor wants to \u201credeem\u201d the coins anyway\u2026\n\nEither way it seems like they\u2019d be getting rid of real assets in order to \u201cdestroy\u201d some coins, which \u2026 makes no sense here.\n\nSo \u2026 what??",

The total withdrawn is now, allowing for minor fluctuations in the stablecoin\u2019s peg, about one-eighth of the entire reserves of the company.\n\nThis is what the article is based on - that Tether is being burned. No other evidence is mentioned, including comparison of reported backing reserves over time. Even if they had, they only have line-items on a balance sheet and little stopping them from \"adjusting\" the value of \u201cother investments\u201d or any other line item without any asset sale to back it up. \n\nAnd yes I'm assuming that Tether might control a large un-dispersed supply of their own token that they can burn or sell depending on market conditions - that doesn't seem like an unreasonable assumption.",
