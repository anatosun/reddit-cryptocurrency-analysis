And 4 Corners itself has a very very long and stellar history of covering weighty issues that matter.\n\nAnd anyway, they interviewed me last year, and I was really impressed with the end result. Which was good, because I was expecting a bit of a hatchet job based on how other media was reporting at the time.\n\nSo check it out. It is available on iView, both through the app (where sadly you have to register and log in) or live on the https://iview.abc.net.au/ website. But do be aware of time differences. We\u2019re UTC+10 here.",
