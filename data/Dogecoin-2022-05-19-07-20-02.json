Because 100% gain now would equate to Doge being up over 220x from a year today.\n\nEven if Doge hit its ATH again that's only 2.55x it's current price. So if you're new please don't expect to be getting rich of Doge now.\n\nTL;DR Doge has already Mooned, and hate on other cryptos is uncalled for.",

And to point out it's current gains over the last year and to have the opinion that it will not have the same gains in terms of percentage is not steerig people away, it's pointing out that past growth is not an indicator of future gains. \"and your breath stinks\" are you actually 12?",

This is assuming mass adoption which takes doge into the top 3 or so per market cap. Not saying happening tomorrow/ever but certainly possible.",
