            "selftext": "Hi, I recently created an open-source Ethereum miner for Xbox. You can look at it here:\n\n[https://github.com/kgrossnickle/eth-box](https://github.com/kgrossnickle/eth-box)\n\nI know what you're thinking-- and yes, this is for real and --not a scam-- !! I have a background in software engineering and masters in statistics and used that knowledge in the fun world of open-source crypto and Etherum :P \n\nUnfortunately, it only gets around 3 MH/s on my Xbox Series S right now. BUT with the help of the open-source community, I think it is possible to reach around 15 MH/s on the series S (possibly higher) and 30 MH/s on the series X.  No idea on the Xbox One.\n\nAlso as of right now, I haven't made it available to mine without building from source (AKA doing super nerdy software stuff to run the miner). If people help me increase the MH/s to make this really usable as a miner, I'll create a downloadable, easy to install Xbox miner. \n\nI made this as a Proof of Concept to get around all the hardware (Xbox, PS5 etc.) that is not user-configurable and is actively anti-crypto. Since the POC is done, I don't have major plans on making the miner better and easy to use, but I did put my ether wallet up on the github page. If I get donations I'll spend some time making it better. I've already put \\~200 hours in this so I'm kinda done ATM so I would need some motivation to keep working on it lol. However, I will merge good PRs etc from open source community regardless <3\n\nIf you like this idea, please please give it a star on Github so we can increase visibility. And if you are a developer  (especially HLSL shader developers!!!), please take a look at the code, make a PR and make this miner feasible.\n\nAsk here for any questions!",
