I am wondering how to make a low-risk investment.\n\nSo.  \nFor example, I bought 1 Eth for 2000$ and want to set an order to sell it if (or when) the price goes up to 2050, or drops below 1950, and about selling low, I would like to automatically rebuy it when the price is 1950 again. Is it possible and how? Thanks.",

But, for the sake of answering your question, there are limit orders you can set, but its not automatic. You would have to manually set your limit sell and limit buy orders and wait for them to hit. \n\nThere are trading bots out there that you can link to your accounts that automate based on your requirements.",
