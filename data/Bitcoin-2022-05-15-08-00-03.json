This has the following benefits:\n\n- This makes taxes easier.\n- Lets you use technological advancements like apple pay/ upi in india/ and other mobile payments networks.\n- Lets you take benefits like purchase protection/ extended warranties/ credit card discounts.\n\nNow Ill say what I think adoption really is. People holding bitcoin for what bitcoin is. Incorruptible, unconfiscatable property. If a person is keeping his long term savings in bitcoin, he is doing much more to further adoption than Gucci accepting bitcoin.\n\nMetrics to measure this kind of adoption would be %population holding bitcoin and average time bitcoin is held. Also market cap moving average is a loose indicator of this.\n\nSome events that would definitely mark an increase in adoption would be:\n- More countries allowing people to use bitcoin without capital gains taxes.\n- Apple letting you hold bitcoin in their wallet app.\n- Bitcoin friendly President in the US.\n- A G2 nation holding Bitcoin reserves.\n- Also if gifting bitcoin becomes a thing. People tend to hold on to gifts longer than the things they buy.",
