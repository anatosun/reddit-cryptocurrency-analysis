This has the following benefits:\n\n- This makes taxes easier.\n- Lets you use technological advancements like apple pay/ upi in india/ and other mobile payments networks.\n- Lets you take benefits like purchase protection/ extended warranties/ credit card discounts.\n\nNow Ill say what I think adoption really is. People holding bitcoin for what bitcoin is. Incorruptible, unconfiscatable property. If a person is keeping his long term savings in bitcoin, he is doing much more to further adoption than Gucci accepting bitcoin.\n\nMetrics to measure this kind of adoption would be %population holding bitcoin and average time bitcoin is held. Also market cap moving average is a loose indicator of this.\n\nSome events that would definitely mark an increase in adoption would be:\n- More countries allowing people to use bitcoin without capital gains taxes.\n- Apple letting you hold bitcoin in their wallet app.\n- Bitcoin friendly President in the US.\n- A G2 nation holding Bitcoin reserves.\n- Also if gifting bitcoin becomes a thing. People tend to hold on to gifts longer than the things they buy.",

The lower it is, the easier it is to 51% attack the network. Just look at all the crappy chains that have been attacked. Obviously the more decentralised the mining power the better, but to call it superficial is stupid. \n\nI don\u2019t even know how to approach the last part of your comment. It shows such a poor understanding it\u2019s difficult for me to even know where to start correcting you. First of all what is a mining address?! Second it doesn\u2019t matter what the difficult is, blocks rewards will always be spread between miners based on their share of the hash rate with obvious variance.\n\nIf you come on the r/bitcoin sub telling people they have no clue, you better make sure you know what you\u2019re talking about.",

At the same time i now own a bigger part of the pie which automatically decreases security. It's nowhere near 51% but it is closer to it than it was before. Hence i am not increasing network security but rather decreasing it. If that added hashrate were to come from multiple miners instead of just me then the distribution would be better and the portion of the pie that each one of us get is smaller so security remains similar despite the fluctuation in hashrate.\n\nSecond and this is the best part, network difficulty is by definition an algorithm. That's it. The current volume of satoshis minted at every transaction block is very specific, doesn't change and only change once in a few years after what we call a \"halving\". The \"halving\" decreases block rewards by half to decrease the minted coins and provide deflation. The difficulty algorithm does one thing and one thing only. It makes sure that the exact number of satoshis minted as reward per block is propely distributed between mining adresses. That's it, that simple. Whenever total hashrate fluctuates the difficulty algorithm adjust and provides more or less rewards per address based on if the hashrate is higher or lower than before. From a technical standpoint difficulty has absolutely nothing to do with security, it's all about reward distribution from solved transaction blocks. That's basically how every network in the crypto market works and everyone with the technical knowledge necessary can confirm this.\n\nYou can go into any sub, literal go on copy this OP post on any sub and people will laugh. So i repeat, whoever posted this has no clue.\n\nThe problem is this sub used to be quite tech savvy a few years ago and now it has turned completely into a meme/fomo sub where everyone just copies shit or in this case charts made by financial \"gurus\" rather than actual engineers.",

The scale of modern religious conflicts does not compare to the scale of the Crusades and other religious wars of the Middle Ages.\n\n2. Israel and the wars in Africa are tied directly to government, as Dave said. You seem to have excluded the part immediately after where he says \"[...] anymore, unless there's governments who are in bed with religion who are trying to impose themselves on other governments.\"\n\n> Look at polls from back then. It didn\u2019t start becoming unpopular until 2012. 88% support November 2001.\n\nThat's his point...it would not have been popular had the war been financed with taxes directly. And if it *would* have been initially popular, it definitely would have fallen out of favor much quicker if people were continually paying for it.\n\n\"First seek to understand, then to be understood.\"",
