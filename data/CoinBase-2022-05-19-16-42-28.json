Coinbase allows you to trade instantly, but taking it off the platform is delayed until the transaction is officially complete by your bank.  This time period will vary depending on fast your bank is, but some debit cards are usually instant.  \n\nMore here: https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/buying-selling-or-converting-crypto/how-long-does-a-purchase-or-deposit-take-to-complete\n\nLet us know if that helps clear things up or if you're still having issues.",
