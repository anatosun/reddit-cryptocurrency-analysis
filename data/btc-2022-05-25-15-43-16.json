It's also unnecessary. What phones can do is severely limited by the power available to them, in the form of their batteries. If you were to run a live, full-node on a phone, it would chew through the battery extremely quickly. You'd basically need to keep the phone plugged in all the time. At that point you'd be better off just running your full node from a regular PC that's more suited to the task.\n\nYou can run a full node on very cheap and low-power computers, like a Raspberry Pi. If you're concerned about privacy and security, you can have your wallet app on your phone interface with your self-hosted node sitting at home (or wherever else). There's no need to run full nodes on phones.",

Mining contributes to secure the network. A nonmining node might be handy for personal use, or fun, but doesn't benefit security.",

Miners have a financial incentive to send their winning block only to other miners, so that their peers validate, accept and then begin mining on top of their block. So miner don't want to send their blocks to full nodes because it is a waste of their time.\n\nMiners only want to listen to other miners, and not full nodes. Any hostile full node can send a steady diet of fake blocks. The miner must then validate and reject those blocks and ignore those nodes, when it would rather have only valid blocks from mining peers. If a valid block has been discovered and recorded by a peer, then the miner wants to get their hardware started on the next block ASAP.\n\n----\n\nIf a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound. Effectively, if you run a full-node, or there are thousands of full nodes, and no miners are listening to those nodes, it doesn't matter what consensus rules they run. Miners only mine on valid blocks and they can't afford to listen to full-nodes for their critical data, i.e. the next block.\n\n... The \"only case\" is the need for applications (client side) or services (server side) programs to have access to chain data. The full nodes offer no other benefit besides a localize copy of the chain for immediate access. This is like a local cache and is necessary, because to my first point, miners don't really want to serve up data to non-miners. Miners want to emit their new blocks to other miners, because they want those other miners to start building on their new blocks quickly to avoid orphans. Sure, they would also like to emit them to some full-nodes, but their outbound bandwidth is prioritized for other miners or pool participants\n\n---\n\nTherefore, miners don't really connect to full nodes, as a malicious full node could spout an endless supply of junk blocks, which the miner would have to waste its time validating. A sort of denial-of-hashing ... scenario. Very strong game-theory arguments have been made that full nodes should be ignored and are largely counter productive and waste resources. The only case for them seems to be if you're running an application or service that requires immediate access to blockchain data.",

A full node can't produce a block at all. The only way for it to produce a block would be to locally reset the difficulty. But as soon as the full node sends the header, the mining node will reject it because the difficultly is too low.\n\nThis idea that there shouldn't really be full nodes is kind of a BSV thing. They've gone so far as to knock most of their nodes off the network, creating exactly the sort of hypercentralized system the BTC maxis thought BCH would turn into.\n\nIn fact for mass adoption we will need plenty of nodes to serve SPV clients.

(hmm, that kind of sounds like BSV). But fee revenues, and the coin's prosperity (value), require miners to capitulate and actually provide service by recording and transmitting transactions.\n\nThen aside from whitelisting select reputable retailers, exchanges or service providers, what incentive exists for communicating with arbitrary, non-mining peers? What stops a miner from simply rejecting all traffic outside those miners and reputable peers in their whitelist? From another perspective, if you operated a full node to support your trade or service, what incentive do *you* have to serve other full-node peers? *So any insights would be helpful in identifying my missing incentive that could motivate a miner to serve all full nodes, rather than selected peers.*",

It's a byproduct of both network optimization and defense. I would expect these forces to play out in any distributed system. With that, I offer a counterpoint, that whitelisting is a deliberate effort to avoid hashpower segmentation, and hence the need to prioritize mining peers.\n\n> You don't have to be a full node to DoS a miner.\n\nCorrect. The DDoS I mentioned was a general attack, not specifically coming from other full nodes. Although an effective attack would likely include first masquerading as legit nodes before dropping the hammer. It's simply that access by pedestrian full nodes would be the first casualty of any DDoS event. Over time hard decisions are made about firewall policies, and unfortunately solutions involve some sort of reputation management tools.\n\n> Mining is fundamentally anonymous. We only think we know who mines what block, but that's because they voluntarily put a message in the blocks they mine.\n\n**This is strong point.** How can you whitelist miners, or blacklist non-mining peers, when all connected peers are homogeneous?\n\nI think they start out as anonymous actors but the benefits of forming cartels outweigh the need for anonymity. Mining pools and at-scale miners benefit more from being well known.\n\nSo perhaps it's better said; miners (will eventually) prioritize their network peers and traffic, starting with well known highly available mining nodes down to anonymous pedestrian nodes. This means *low-bandwidth anonymous nodes, mining or not, are the last served by the network.* It's not to say that it's required (as BSV), only that it's the effect of prioritization by mature network operations.\n\n> They're into MinerID where every miner is KYCed \n\nThey're bonkers.

Are you aware of any?\n\n**Edit:** I learned that there is a phone with 1tb+ of memory, aka storage.\n\nVery few people, IMO, would be interested in maintaining a full node on their phones. Currently the BTC blockchain is over 407GB in size, the BCH blockchain is 216GB. SPV wallets are good enough for mobile phones.\n\nIt really astounds me when individuals (usually BTC Maxis) put forth the idea that everyone should run a full node, but seem to forget that their mobile phones simple cannot do this.\n\n**Edit:** OK, some of them can do it. But, running a full node would likely take a massive amount of electricity since it is always sending/receiving data, effectively making your mobile device tethered to a wall outlet.",
