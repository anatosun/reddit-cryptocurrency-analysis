            "selftext": "How can an Ethereum project stop the contract from selling and still power the buyback without killing the project\u2019s momentum? The solution is PYESwap, the only exchange to utilize ETH to power buyback functionality.\n\nThe biggest obstacle for developers building projects with tokenomics on all chains is the tokens automatically build up in the contract and then they're dumped on the market to power the buyback. Thus creating negative impact on the charts.\n\nCurrently running on the Binance Smart Chain, PYE is coming to the Ethereum chain this Tuesday, May 17, via presale. Instead of taking the tokens, PYESwap collects the fees upfront in BNB, and soon ETH as well, absolving the negative impact that swaps such as Uniswap or Sushiswap currently have on projects.\n\n\u2b50This creates a net positive impact for those on Swap 2.0 Routers!\n\nReady to migrate your token project to Swap 2.0?\n\n1. Go to [MoonForce.com](https://moonforce.com/) (which is powered by [PYESwap](https://pyeswap.com/)) and click *Platform*.\n2. Select *Create Launch* to launch a project on MoonForce.\n3. Click *Create My Presale* and then connect your wallet.\n\nJoin PYENation on Discord to learn more!  \n[https://discord.gg/YdaAjnTR](https://discord.gg/YdaAjnTR)",
