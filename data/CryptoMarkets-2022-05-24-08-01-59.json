Which means you did your research on them and hopefully didn't invest.\n\nThere are true gems out there that have nothing to do with scams or ponzi schemes but you have to either be lucky or spend a long time looking at different projects to find one.\n\nI have a good example of an undervalued defi coin. Unidx\n\nIt's the token of the [Unidex platform](https://unidex.exchange/). A multi chain aggregation layer for all of defi.\n\nAll unidx tokens that will ever exist (4 million) are already in circulation and holders of the unidx token receives 50% of the platforms fee revenue in USDC on fantom. No staking or anything. Just hold the token.\n\nIt's still a smallcap token and the trading volume through the platform is not massive but it's moving in the right direction and is in no way a ponzi scheme.\n\nI know this comes off as shilling and I am indeed a holder of Unidx token, but anyone who reads this should do themselves a favor and go check it out. Even if you don't want to buy the unidx token, doing your defi trades through unidex will most often result in a better price and more tokens for you. At worst it'll be the same price as the dex you would otherwise have used.",

One was some solar energy company from Australia, another was something to do with shared supercomputing.  Anyways you get the point, I thought that made more sense than blindly buying. Ya, no..... All the coins (think I invested in 5-6 companies) are totally worthless now. I have not logged into my Binance account in over a year.  I'm not upset about the money I lost as it was only a couple hundred, but more so the fact that companies with real business models and plans to offer something not many others were, turned out to be the dumb thing to do.
