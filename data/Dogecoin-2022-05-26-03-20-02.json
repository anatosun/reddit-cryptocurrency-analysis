I signed up for their wallets so i could send it to my personal wallet out of RH. Last time I checked i was like #30,000 on the waiting list 2 months ago. Now I dont see any waitlist anymore  and still dont have the option to send my doge. Anyone facing a similar issue. Also I live in NY so not sure if there is any regulation going on in this state that may play a part.",
