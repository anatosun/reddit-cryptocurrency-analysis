I am looking for the most efficient way to do this (least fees)\n\n I have seen that this option is available via credit card but buying BUSD costs $1.015 translating into a 1.5% fee for each transaction. I have seen that buying crypto directly also induces some fees due to a purchasing price higher than that of the market.\n\nI am trying to implement a simple DCA strategy. What is the most efficient way to automate all that in Binance?",
