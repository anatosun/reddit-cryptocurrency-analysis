That's just a question of centralization of mining. No doubt there are economies of scale here. But these apply to all mining, even Monero's if that network becomes widely adopted and valuable.\n\nArguably an application specific integrated circuit is better because it will not lead to a squeeze on general purpose computing resources (similar to squeeze on GPUs observed during past bull markets where GPU-mined alts rose).\n\n> Sweden use a lot of electricity in the winter. for heating.\n\nCPU mineable POW is less energy efficient. When the currency becomes successful, this fact blows up in its face / comes back to haunt it.",
