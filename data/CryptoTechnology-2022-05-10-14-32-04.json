When it comes to my field you learn how to properly read code and tell what a program does by looking at it but when it comes to writing my own stuff. Found out that it is a whole other ball game. I've learned Python, rust and solidity. I also learned a ton about developing on web3 from start to finish through Polygon's hackathons and developer resources. As someone who learns by doing, I highly recommend some workshops and hackathons.\n\nI haven't really found any web3 projects yet as this is kind of a side project but I constantly hear about how much in demand Solidity and web3 developers are right now. There's a massive amount of money to be made. My question to you is this, do you think this is just another fad? or could solidity be the new Python or Java? Something that becomes the industry standard. Rust by itself already feels like the new Python if I'm going to be honest.\n\nI personally believe this is the next step forward for a ton of facets of technology. I believe game development is going to move to the blockchain. Security is going to move to the blockchain, web3 hosting, etc. I genuinely don't think this is something that's going to get hype and die out, you might as well get a head start on the learning.

A technology needs to provide some benefit -- it must make life better/easier for some set of customers.  Silk road made buying illicit drugs and hiring assassins easier.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the only thing blockchain tech has made easier is running *bigger fool* scams.  Providing value to conmen (and only conmen) is not a good thing.\n\nSmart contracts for real estate escrow would be a real innovation but that seems farther off than all automobiles in the USA being self driving cars.",
