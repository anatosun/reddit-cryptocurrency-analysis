If your going to invest id certainly consider learning about these 2, then decide for yourself if its for you.  \n  \nOther than them 2 id look at the other top 20 coins, research them, check white papers, road map, usecase, who are the team behind them, are they transparent. Any of them you like then maybe consider them.  \n  \nLooking for a moonshot??  \nThese kind of investments have highest rewards but also the highest risk.  \n  Do your own research in all cases.  \n\n  \nTreat crypto like a casino, you may win big, you may lose it all, so only throw fun/beer/drug money at it \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d  \n  \nEnjoy the ride.",
