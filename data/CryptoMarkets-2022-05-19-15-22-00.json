Personally I am a developer and I want to dedicate the next few or a couple of months developing something for web3 but I am kind of skeptical with the options I am having.\n\nSee if I decide to join the likes of Google (the big corps that are driving web2), it's going to be the same old vicious cycle that we are in at the moment. I want a platform that is independent, has a vision for itself and we as devs and most importantly one that I get to keep rights for all my content.\n\nWhat do you guys recommend I should check out? Any platforms close to your heart?",
