            "selftext": "Rich countries have incentive to hold onto their fiat currency. The poorer nations and individuals who discover the power of Bitcoin are incentivised to ditch fiat for a better alternative. \n\nThe longer the rich nations hold out with their fiat the longer the poorer nations will have to accumulate and hence bring the wealth gap closer together during eventual bull markets. \n\nThe arrogance of the rich and powerful is in essence the very thing starting to destroy them and re distribute this power to the people. It\u2019s very ironic and I love it.\n\nThis is also a main argument against the banning of Bitcoin. Like sure, go ahead, but you\u2019ll be missing out and you\u2019ll regret it when everyone else has it and rides the bull into the sunset.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, I get the current distribution of bitcoins isn\u2019t any better. However, I am suggesting rich nation states will slowly lose their power and we could transition into an era where individuals can accumulate their wealth in a capitalist society. No more bailouts either; it\u2019s all fair game and we should see the wealth gap stop exploding.",

The politicians are always available to be wooed into a mutually beneficial agreement that essentially prints money into their pockets.  With Bitcoin, the Pareto distribution will still hold, but anyone that chooses to save their wealth will still be able to, and no amount of manipulation can generate infinite Bitcoin for the politician to distribute as he pleases.  The distribution of wealth will be based much more on the amount of value you provide to the world, and there will always be individuals more willing and able to do this than others.  These people make it easier (cheaper) for the rest of the world to live, thus making it easier for everyone to save their Bitcoin by lowering prices through increased efficiency.  \n\nWe do not need to fix the wealth gap.  We need to allow rational markets to exist.  Everything improves as a result, and the poorest people benefit without having to do any of the work.  If at any point they are willing or able to provide more value, their efforts will provide them with ever increasing rewards in the form of cheaper and higher quality products and services.  Victims of circumstances outside of their control, the sick and disabled, benefit too from this.  It is cheaper to help them, so the goodwill of people willing to do so goes much further in rational markets.",

If rich people earn their money honestly, then they are adding value to the world by doing so.  If they earn it dishonestly, then under a Bitcoin dominated economy it will be much harder to keep it.  Using fiat money, the ultra rich can stay wealthy using essentially 0% interest loans and other unnatural market conditions to keep their momentum going.  Yes, there will always be rich people.  Under a stable currency the poorest people will do much better, and they will have a much better time saving and investing their own money to change their circumstance.",

If only the small guy can loose how will they ever catch up even if they are right and the big guy wrong. Historically wealth was lost within 3 generation. It's just nature, the kids grow up without any worry but they still have their parents to instil the values that built the company but as you get further and further into the generations these ideas slowly disappear and the company, investment or whatever crumbles. Others see their mistakes, pick up the rubble for cheap and the cycle repeats. This goes away with too big to fail. Once your in that class your set forever. \n\nNow I disagree that the world no longer uses a class system. It does just by a different name and rules of enforcement. \n\nI don't see an issue with rewarding the most productive but we need to let them deal with their own consequences, good or bad.",

If you haven\u2019t read The Bitcoin Standard I highly recommend it.  The fiat system rewards people for acting irrationally, and for establishing corrupt ties to the government.  Bitcoin doesn\u2019t make this impossible, but it does fundamentally change the rules of the financial system in favor of the average person over the wealthy elite. It evens the playing field.  \n\nIn a fiat system corruption and irrational markets is a feature of the system.  It creates bogus rich people and severely punishes poor people or anyone that tries to save their money instead of using it as leverage to borrow more.  Without this mechanism, rich people will not have the same advantages they do today over poorer people.  There will not be near 0% interest rates to borrow Bitcoin and pay it back 10 years in the future, which is what we have today.  Imagine someone wanting to borrow 10 Bitcoin from you today, and will pay you back 10.5 Bitcoin in 10 years.  Nobody will take that deal because we expect Bitcoin will be worth much more in the future.  With fiat, this is what rich people have access to because when a bank loans 10 dollars, they can print 9 more out of thin air.  They are incentivized by the system to continuously loan out more and more money.  But poor people pay 18% on credit cards.  \n\nI can\u2019t recommend more highly that you read The Bitcoin Standard.",
