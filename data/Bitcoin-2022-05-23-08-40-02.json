The poorer nations and individuals who discover the power of Bitcoin are incentivised to ditch fiat for a better alternative. \n\nThe longer the rich nations hold out with their fiat the longer the poorer nations will have to accumulate and hence bring the wealth gap closer together during eventual bull markets. \n\nThe arrogance of the rich and powerful is in essence the very thing starting to destroy them and re distribute this power to the people. It\u2019s very ironic and I love it.\n\nThis is also a main argument against the banning of Bitcoin. Like sure, go ahead, but you\u2019ll be missing out and you\u2019ll regret it when everyone else has it and rides the bull into the sunset.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, I get the current distribution of bitcoins isn\u2019t any better. However, I am suggesting rich nation states will slowly lose their power and we could transition into an era where individuals can accumulate their wealth in a capitalist society. No more bailouts either; it\u2019s all fair game and we should see the wealth gap stop exploding.",

If only the small guy can loose how will they ever catch up even if they are right and the big guy wrong. Historically wealth was lost within 3 generation. It's just nature, the kids grow up without any worry but they still have their parents to instil the values that built the company but as you get further and further into the generations these ideas slowly disappear and the company, investment or whatever crumbles. Others see their mistakes, pick up the rubble for cheap and the cycle repeats. This goes away with too big to fail. Once your in that class your set forever. \n\nNow I disagree that the world no longer uses a class system. It does just by a different name and rules of enforcement. \n\nI don't see an issue with rewarding the most productive but we need to let them deal with their own consequences, good or bad.",

The people that became involved with Blockchain didn't understand the tech and were ignorant of the ecosystems philosophy and duplicated the same egregious failures they created in the traditional economy. \n\nWhy?\n\nDevBros didn't document shit and if they did: its on github. Good luck with that. What a shit show. \n\nAnd the documents that did get filed, are now missing, deleted, broken links, and/or these projects use the buzzwords I give them:\n\n- Store of Value \n- Gold like Value (where'd that go huh?! Lol.)\n- Utility... (do they even understand what that actually means?)\n\nThey're marketing buzzwords that are approximate in definition to the message & meaning they attempt to convey. I'm not doing it to make fun of them. I say it because we, others and myself included have been trying to guide the knuckleheads. \n\nDon't give up on that dream, but I no longer share it with you:\n\nTime to move forward and on.
