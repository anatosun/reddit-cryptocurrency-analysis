As many may know, when LTC was a top 10 crypto the LTC community dubbed it \"the silver to bitcoins gold\". As LTC was once larger/ more popular than DOGE it was also said to be 'supporting' DOGE and the DOGE community seemed to be quite happy literally being the underdog \ud83d\ude0e\n\nNow DOGE has flipped/ stayed above LTC for sometime and DOGE is the top 10 crypto the reverse logic ought to be true so I thought I'd have a bit of fun with that.. but apparently someone's not so happy to be the underdog \ud83e\udd37\n\nI've been a bit disappointed in Litecoin slipping away and been considering selling out for a while. One of the things I have loved about the LTC community us it's ability not to take itself too seriously and also not feel too threatened by whatever else is going on (a bit like DOGE!) This was a sort of test post in LTC to see if that ethos still existed at least.. but sadly/ apparently not.\n\nJust joined the Dogecoin community \ud83d\ude00\n\nNever take yourselves to seriously Dogecoin even now you've become serious! \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4d",
