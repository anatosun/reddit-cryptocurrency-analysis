Coinbase will issue an IRS form called 1099-MISC to report miscellaneous income rewards to customers that meet the following criteria:\n\nYou're a Coinbase customer AND\nYou're a US person for tax purposes AND\nYou've earned $600 or more in miscellaneous income such as rewards or fees from Coinbase Earn, USDC Rewards, and/or staking in 2021\n\nIt\u2019s important to note: you\u2019re responsible for reporting all crypto you receive or fiat currency you made as income on your tax forms, even if you earn just $1. If you earn $600 or more in a year paid by an exchange, including Coinbase, the exchange is required to report these payments to the IRS as \u201cother income\u201d via IRS Form 1099-MISC (you\u2019ll also receive a copy for your tax return).\n\nSo if you have earned anything in 2021 it is important to make sure you make it notified to avoid anything happening in the future \n\n Here's a helpful resource on tax documents: https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/taxes-reports-and-financial-services/taxes/do-I-qualify-for-coinbase-tax-forms\n\nYou can find your history of IRS forms in the Documents section of your Coinbase Tax Center, including a digital copy of your 1099-MISC for 2021, if you received one (you'll also be mailed a paper copy unless you opt to go paperless in the Preferences section of the Tax Center). \n\nHope this helps!",
