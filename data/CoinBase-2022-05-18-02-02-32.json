Making coinbase nonzero responsible for trading losses since they could have reasoned before the crash, that LUNA crash must happen at some point simply by understanding Luna's inadequate UST wormhole instead of collateral like the top 10 cryptocurrencies now.  The vulnerability that caused the feedback loop leading to LUNA return to near zero value is fundamentally the same thing that puts a hard max size limit on a ponzie and causes the sudden death.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y\\_otSD3LYCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_otSD3LYCA)\n\nShame Coinbase.  Shame.\n\nAnd before you say: \"Mistakes happen, nobody really could have known\" that's not true.  See above video for proof, it was made when LUNA was still trading between $80 and $120.\n\nA few phonecalls to congress might be the ammo they need to shut this whole carnival clownshow down for the same reason they plucked Bernie Madoff out of his crystal fortress.  WLUNA was and still is a textbook ponzi that returns to intrinsic value when destabilized or it consumes every buyer on the planet, making its continuation impossible.\n\nThe scheme of: \"give me a dollar so that 2 other fools can give you $1 each\" works perfectly until base layer of the pyramid can't find more buyers.  That concept is the core that puts a hard max limit size to how many billions of dollars all the WLUNA shares could ever command within reason.\n\nThe WLUNA market price says it took the world roughly 72 hours to pick up what I'm trying to lay down here.",

Coinbase will issue an IRS form called 1099-MISC to report miscellaneous income rewards to customers that meet the following criteria:\n\nYou're a Coinbase customer AND\nYou're a US person for tax purposes AND\nYou've earned $600 or more in miscellaneous income such as rewards or fees from Coinbase Earn, USDC Rewards, and/or staking in 2021\n\nIt\u2019s important to note: you\u2019re responsible for reporting all crypto you receive or fiat currency you made as income on your tax forms, even if you earn just $1. If you earn $600 or more in a year paid by an exchange, including Coinbase, the exchange is required to report these payments to the IRS as \u201cother income\u201d via IRS Form 1099-MISC (you\u2019ll also receive a copy for your tax return).\n\nSo if you have earned anything in 2021 it is important to make sure you make it notified to avoid anything happening in the future \n\n Here's a helpful resource on tax documents: https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/taxes-reports-and-financial-services/taxes/do-I-qualify-for-coinbase-tax-forms\n\nYou can find your history of IRS forms in the Documents section of your Coinbase Tax Center, including a digital copy of your 1099-MISC for 2021, if you received one (you'll also be mailed a paper copy unless you opt to go paperless in the Preferences section of the Tax Center). \n\nHope this helps!",
