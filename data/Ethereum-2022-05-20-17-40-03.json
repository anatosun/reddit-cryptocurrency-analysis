When I look on opensea and ledger live I can see the ENS token in my wallet, but when I view my account in the ENS app it says that my address doesn\u2019t own any domains\u2026 if I search the name it lists my address as the controller but not the registrant. The name had expired and was purchase with a premium, premium period had around two days left. Is there just a delay for it to show up in my ens account or did I do something wrong? Thanks",

Inside the (chaindata) i can see 11.72 GB in which contain: (log and a lot of files ending as follows 292900.ldb etc. \n\nAlso there is a folder name (testnet) in which is 282.4 MB and inside that folder i can see other folder as follow: chaindata-nodes-dapp-nodekey.\n\nMy question is: \n\nwhat's the easiest way to access this ether or try to recover any ether from there. I honestly don\u2019t know if there is anything there but i do remember back on those days try to mining ether/bitcoin with my MacBook pro and experimenting a bit with Ethereum.  \n\nI don\u2019t even remember the name of the software that i did install. I did notice the file right now because i was cleaning the MacBook Pro and notice 12.01 GB of data and i could see the files contain this information. \n\nAny idea how can i find out if there is anything there? - The close thing i remember was playing with https://www.myetherwallet.com/ \n\nThank you so much for your time. \n\nPS: Honestly, i don\u2019t know what to expect from this. Thanks guys.",
