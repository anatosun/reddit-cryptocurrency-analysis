Yesterday out of the blue thousands of my funds disappear. I check my new account and I only see $0.01USD and $0.50SOL...\n\nI contact support and they said the transfer is pending, although when I asked how much is pending they did not know how much, one support said only $200.... even though I had thousands. Which is leading to believe support stole my funds.",
