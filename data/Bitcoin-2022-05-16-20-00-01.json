A channel requires two on-chain transactions for open and closing, everything else is hidden.\n\n1. you first create one or more direct connections (= \"channel\") with peers. This moves Bitcoin to a multisig wallet in an on-chain transaction.\n2. assuming that at least one of your connections is connected has further outgoing connections, you can now \"route\" payments anywhere in the \"lightning network\", e.g., you \\[A\\] -> your peer \\[B\\] -> someone else \\[C\\] -> someone else \\[D\\] -> destination \\[E\\].\n3. payments change the internal balance of your connection. (Routing through multiple hops is done via lending, e.g., A pays B, B pays C, C pays D. You get no information about what else B and C have done, so it's much more private.)\n4. Closing the channel moves the appropriate remaining balance in an on-chain transaction to the two participants. No information gets released about any of the L2 transactions.",
