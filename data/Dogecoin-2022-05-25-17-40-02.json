            "selftext": "Hey, r/Dogecoin, today we\u2019ll tell you about the steps & issues you may face while creating the Dogecoin Crypto Wallet.   \nTechnically, it is necessary to develop a website where users can create wallets for themselves, receive, store, and send DOGE.\n\nThe simplest and most relevant solution, as it seems, is to buy a dedicated server, run a Dogecoin node on it, and connect to it locally via RPC. But this option initially did not work out for 2 reasons.\n\nFirstly, due to the cost of the server, a server with the necessary parameters costs about $50 per month. Your project may not be originally intended to be commercial. \n\nSecondly, node support requires a qualified specialist in this field, and this is also an additional cost. You can try using our own resources to raise the Dogecoin node, but it can be extremely unstable \u2013 it often hangs up or appears out of sync with the main network, which can be frustrating.\n\n[Dive in to get answers to this questions on working with a foreign node:](https://nownodes.io/blog/the-journey-to-creating-a-crypto-wallet/)\n\n1) How to create addresses and where to store keys?\n\n2) How to receive new transactions?\n\n3) How to generate new transactions?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/90ecpj6cbn191.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=179024857203ee3a35c6907802cb27e9e89d6d3b",
