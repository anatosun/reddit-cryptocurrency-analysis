That mean half as much taxes are paid. Because:\n\nPeople tend to buy some things every week no matter what the price, gas, food, diapers, medicine, electricity, water. This is where his logic twists just a bit, people will STILL buy 2# of food regardless if it\u2019s $10 or $20, they will just find 2# of something else to eat, like tuna casserole and meatloaf instead of steak and chicken breasts. \n\nTherefore the industry providing the most value will thrive, where as the industry already overvalued will have to figure out a way to compete, and well as their entire supply chain.

The Fed is an independent network of private banks. They have a \u201cFederal Open Market Committee\u201d (FOMC), consisting of 12 members who meet and decide on the direction of Fed policy. Five of these committee members are rotating Fed Presidents. Seven are \u201cgovernors\u201d chosen by the president. The governors don\u2019t actually have any direct control over the banks. But by convention, the Fed banks generally do what the FOMC decides.\n\nThe Fed is the Treasury\u2019s bank (both as a deposit institution and an investment bank), so the government is really a customer of the Fed. The Fed doesn\u2019t have to do what the Treasury wants. They never buy Treasury bonds direction from the Treasury.  They do buy Treasuries from other banks and institutions on the open market. They sell them on the open market too. The balance of buying and selling acts as a huge force on bond prices (and hence interest rates), since the Fed is the only institution in the world with the power to create U.S. dollars out of nothing, backed by nothing. \n\n\u201cInflationary fiat\u201d is a very hand wavy term since it can refer to money created by both the Fed and by private banks. Most of the dollars in the world are created by non-Fed private banks. These banks are subject to a very complex set of regulations and constraints that are supposed to ensure their liquidity. When the Fed creates dollars, they are called Reserves, and they can never leave the Fed system. They are held in deposit accounts for all the private banks and institutions that have accounts at the Fed. The amount of Reserves a bank has determines its ultimate ability to pay back the bank\u2019s creditors, hence the Reserve balances of individual banks play a vital role in determining a bank\u2019s liquidity.\n\nGenerally speaking, banks used to hold much smaller Reserve balances than they do today. But then the 2007-2008 financial crisis happened, and there was a *massive* shortage of Reserves. This happened because a bunch of supposedly smart people created very complex financial derivatives that concealed the true level of bank liabilities, and most importantly the volatility of those liabilities. A large dip in the housing market began making banks all over the world insolvent.\n\nThe Fed ultimately responded by buying up Treasuries and mortgage backed securities at unprecedented levels. This is what has come to be known as \u201cquantitative easing\u201d. The Fed had always bought and sold Treasury bonds but it used to keep its net balance of Treasuries rather low. The big change with QE was that the Fed began the practice of holding Treasuries on its balance sheet, permanently. This has allowed the U.S. government to create even larger and larger amounts of debt, and has allowed banks to buy that debt and sell it to the Fed for more than they paid. Whenever there is an impending deflationary crisis (especially 2011, 2015, 2018, and 2020) banks have been able to sell whatever Treasuries they are holding for an attractive price in order to secure more Reserves to ensure their regulatory liquidity requirements.\n\nWith an inflationary crisis like now, it\u2019s quite different. The real value of old debt is falling fast, so people and institutions aren\u2019t generally having liquidity problems. Increased prices are creating economic strains though, especially with the production of new debt (which is becoming more expensive). The Fed was late to realize that consumer inflation had increased dramatically, but they have now acknowledged it and are not buying Treasuries and MBSs at the rates they previously were. This will continue to drive rates up, but that means new loans will become harder and harder to come by, and the economy will slow. Consumers and businesses won\u2019t be able to spend at the rate they have been, and inflation will decrease.",

We recently had realistic concerns about Russia bombing it. Point is, I can see why countries would \"kill nuclear.\" Some things like wars and natural disasters just can't be controlled. The effects are obviously insane- widespread and horrific. We aren't ready for it man. \n\nJust a ramble but I really want to see nuclear take off. Really don't want the world all fucked up with radioactive gas.",

I mean, when I was a kid, I was terrified of nuclear. I heard all kinds of awful things, and when we'd drive by the plant I'd hold my breath and worry that it was going to explode. Seriously. But compared ruining the world with climate change from fossil fuels, or killing the fish with hydro, or just having inconsistent power with wind and solar, nuclear's downsides are manageable imho and getting smaller with every generation. As far as longterm potential, nuclear is right up there with fusion and geothermal, probably ahead of them since it's practical almost anywhere at this point.",

Nuclear is literally the safest form of energy production, [in terms of deaths caused](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/safety-of-nuclear-power-reactors.aspx). Fossil fuels obviously cause a huge amount of deaths via pollution, but perhaps surprisingly, hydro power has occasional catetrophic accidents that level towns and kill many people in flood waters. \n\nBy contrast, there have literally only been 3 nuclear accidents in human history. Only one of those accidents had any confirmed deaths (Chernobyl). Airplane crashes make the news because they basically never happen and are way safer than cars. Car crashes happen every minute of every day and don't make the news because they're so common. Same thing with nuclear. Coal kills people constantly. So why are we so worried about a source of power that has only killed people once and we only even have to worry about once per decade at most? Its silly. Its sensationalist news and idiotic propaganda. \n\nBack in the day, the masses imagined that nuclear power plants could maybe blow up like nuclear bombs. This simply isn't possible. Do people still think that's possible? Probably. I don't know. But its ridiculous. It takes a lot of specific engineering to make a bomb, and power plants don't do those things. \n\nNuclear waste is the other commonly sited thing. Nuclear waste is really dangerous and will last 1000s of years? Well, don't drink it. Don't swim in it. Properly stored nuclear waste won't seep into ground water. Its not hard to make sure of that. Also, part of the reason we even have toxic nuclear waste is that we stopped researching nuclear technology in the 1970s. If we hadn't, we would have breeder reactors now that would process that nuclear waste so it only lasts 50 yeas instead of 1000 and would be way less radioactive (and therefore less dangerous). \n\nThe nuclear energy detractors are working off of rhetoric that is literally dozens of years old, and they can't seem to think for themselves. Its super frustrating.",

                            "response": "Being a reserve currency wouldn't on its own. But if bitcoin was the world reserve currency, it would very likely also be widely used as a normal currency as well. In the case a significant fraction of a nation's transactions are done in bitcoin, it would do the following:\n\n* It would limit the ability for the nation's central bank to create money. Eg if 35% of the nation's transactions are done in bitcoin, it means that every printed unit of fiat currency results in 50% more inflation (1/(1-35%) and the nation could only print 65% as much money with the same consequences for the national fiat currency. \n* It would change the dynamics of credit and debt. A similar thing to the above would happen in this realm as well. Central bank levers like QE and interest rate manipulation would be 35% less effective. There would be less credit running around, possibly 35% less if no significant amount of bitcoin is lent out. Bitcoin would probably wouldn't start being lent out until the vast majority of the credit subsidized by fiat money creation is gone. \n* Also, people would need to borrow less money because they would be losing less money via inflation (at least those using bitcoin).\n* Speaking of which, it seems quite likely to me that bitcoin at this point will have stopped trending with the stock market. Bitcoin would likely have stopped having wild increases and dips, and people would have begun to trust it as a stable and boring store of value, rather than a potential get rich quick scheme. This would decouple it from the whims of the stock market a bit, and it would probably act rather more like government bonds, gold, and cash does now, where in recessions money flows from investments (now seen as overly risky and overpriced) into safer forms of investment, which then of course increase in value (the dreaded</sarcasm> deflationary \"spiral\"). If this happens, many people will have a good chunk of their retirement in bitcoin, a good chunk of their normal savings in it, and will have a cusion against bad economic environments. As jobs become scarcer and profits dwindle in an economy that realized its been inefficient (that's what a recession is), people can fall back on the slightly rising value of their savings to cusion the blow. This is a natural way to tide over these kind of times, but inflation destroys our ability to save for the future in this way (and other ways).\n* The national currency would have to compete with bitocin in very real ways, which would probably make most national fiat currencies more restrained, more stable, and generally better. The ones that don't do this would see hyperbitcoinization faster as people see the fiat currency can't compete.\n\nYou might at this point be asking: why is it a good thing to remove the central banks' ability to help the economy. Well this comes down to your point of view on economics. I don't think there's any evidence to show that central banks' manipulation of the economy has helped us. When I think about things logically, I can only conclude that kind of massive market manipulation has been enormously harmful. \n\nWhen a central bank looks at an impending recession they seem to always think \"Silly investors, silly consumers, they don't realize that things are fine! They should be buying more and putting more money into the stock market. Let's artifically make that happen by creating new money and directing where it goes.\" Another way of putting this is that they think that everyone is just overreacting and that stimulating the economy a little bit will compensate for this overreacation.\n\nBut investors and consumers are acting rationally to market conditions as fast as market signals can travel. Central banks don't have any special powers to see the future of the market. They can't see market signals faster than anyone else. Arguably they see them much slower because they have to gather information from everyone else - whereas you can think of the market as a whole as a giant supercomputer acting on signals as soon as they're received. \n\nImagine market signals as akin to packets of light - photons. Photons travel at a speed: the speed of light. Nothing can travel faster than photons. Light from the sun takes about 8 minutes to get to earth. If the sun dimmed by 20% for 30 minutes and we had a centrally planned sun committee to correct for these kinds of things, the equivalent would be that as soon as the Sun Committee saw the dimming, they would fire a huge laser into the sun to stimulate it to get brighter. Let's say that laser does in fact make the sun get brighter.\n\nIt would take 8 minutes for the signal to get to earth, then it would take 8 minutes for the laser to hit the sun. So 16 minutes. At that point, the dimming period is already half over. But the Sun committee doesn't know that yet. So they wait until the Sun gets brighter, which it will 8 minutes later. So far so good. But 6 minutes later, the sun would get 20% brighter because the dimming period would end. And now we have an overheated sun, so the Sun Committee shuts off their laser, and 16 minutes later we get back to normal.\n\nSo let's recap. The earth gets:\n\n* 24 minutes of cooler sunlight,\n* then 8 minutes of normal sunlight again,\n* then 16 minutes of hotter sunlight,\n* then back to normal until the next aberation. \n\nWas this worth it? We got 40 minutes of abnormal sunlight instead of 30. We had more discontinuous changes that make the sun temperature harder to predict. And what if the sun cooled down because it was *already* too hot (this is stretching this metaphor a bit).\n\nThere are a number of things about this that is worse for the central bank money scenario:\n\n* Central Banks don't really know that their lasers work. Sure they can screw with the economy, but they don't really know with any substantial precision what affects their levers have - especially the more recent ones like QE and money printing.\n* Central Banks don't have any idea what the right sunlight temperature is. They don't know how hot markets should be running. Their goal is only stability, not rationality or efficiency. Stability is often at odds with efficiency because sometimes it makes sense to scale back and grow slower.\n* Central banks don't even know how to properly measure the sunlight temperature. Their measures of the economy are incredibly rough and sometimes [outdated](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gdp-is-the-wrong-tool-for-measuring-what-matters).\n* The speed of light of markets is a lot more complicated than C. Different signals travel at different speeds, and neither central banks nor economists have good models to take those speeds into account. \n* The central bank laser weakens the sun. When central banks make debt cheaper, they increase unsustainable debt levels, making it harder to end the stimulus. Really they never do. Inflation itself is \"stimulus\", and since 2008 the US Federal Reserve has been massively stimulating the economy in various ways because we can't scale back to where we were anymore without putting tons of people into default (and risking creditors getting pissy about their risky lending schemes blowing up and asking their corrupt politician friends to bail them out). \n\nAnd even if the above weren't true and central banks had perfect tools for manipulating the economy, knew exactly how to measure the health of the economy and how hot we want it to run at any given time, and exactly how to measure and predict the speeds of market signal propagation, the simple fact that market signals take a significant amount of time to propagate means that they cannot be successful without being able to predict the economy 2-7 years into the future, which they certainly cannot do whatsoever. And with the host of other issues, I have very little doubt that the market manipulation of central banks is harmful cargo cult behavior. And that's not even to mention the moral hazard and perverse incentives of having money you can print and give to your government buddies for whatever they want to do with it to further their careers (and your own).\n\nTo put this into more concrete terms for economics, price signals can take 6 months, 2 years, sometimes 7 years to fully propagate (and they really don't know for sure - those are large error bars). A part of the reason for this is the time it takes for businesses to go from just started to exitable - that's usually a 5-10 year process. And its not just startups. Any big project can take that amount of time to go from inception to profitability, whether they're at big or small, old or new companies. Predictability is very important for startups to be able to succeed - unexpected things kill businesses. We saw that in the US after 2008, the housing construction industry was destroyed - housing construction reduced by 85% in the following decade. \n\nA central bank's actions will ripple through the economy for years after their manipulative actions, well beyond the time the economy is actually considered to be in a recession. The result is that we don't avoid most of the recession, but we do overheat the economy, extend the amount of time the economy spends doing inefficient things, and because of that we then reach the next recession faster and its bigger when it comes.",

What's important is that asset allocation needs to be spent wisely, not sprayed and prayed hoping to hit something.

Let's completely ignore the fact that such an inflationary system allows a middle man to reallocate a significant portion of the economy into their own pockets, which is already an enormous problem by its own right.  Because resources were spent haphazardly and compulsively, you've wasted all the work of your previous years trying to simply maintain the work that would have otherwise just held its value - if you did nothing.\n\nThink of it this way.  You're peddling faster and harder, moving the economy faster and harder, just to move at the same speed you were before.\n\nWhat you should really be looking at is real distance covered, not number of spins of your foot pedal.  So in such a system, yes, you are pedaling less, but you're also covering more ground, because you're not losing all that stored energy, whilst an inflationary system is forcing that energy to dissipate into other areas just to maintain the same value.",

It may be that the only way to find out if this system works is to test it somehow. The real question is, is bitcoin reversible if turns out not to fix the problem of debt cycles, but instead exacerbate them by removing those monetary controls? I'd argue that it's not, that bitcoin is inevitable, antifragile, and possibly an infohazard, and the direction the world is going is already set in stone.

BAD.\n\nIts not a slowing of every part of the economy.  If there are goods that are worth trading for, those trades will still occur as people will find value in making those trades.  Where the slowing down happens will be in those parts where assets are overvalued.\n\nSlowing down overvalued/zombie corporations is a very healthy thing for an economy.  You want to slow down or even remove cancer cells.  Unlimited unchecked growth in the wrong areas are a sign of weakness not strength.\n\nInflation leads to a misallocation of resources because it encourages spending that would otherwise not have occurred.  \n\nGrowth for the sake of growth is not just wasteful, in some cases its unhealthy.  Its like saying you're going to send fat cells to grow your pancreas by 10x because your body needs to grow.  No. sometimes you need to slow, even shrink parts of the system in order to keep the overall system healthy.  Resources need to be allocated properly, not just spent whenever something asks to grow.\n\nMaybe what we need is a feedback loop of slowing that slows these non-beneficial growths to a grinding halt.",

Everything in life is risk vs reward, i.e. gambling. The problem comes when gambling incentivizes others to gamble, i.e. cheaper credit, and not gambling disincentivizes others from gambling, i.e. expensive credit. Cheaper credit stimulates the economy, which in turn causes cheaper credit. More expensive credit slows the economy, which in turn raises the price of credit. \"Normally\" the government uses monetary controls like money printing and interest rates to temper both these situations, to break the feedback loops, or at least lessen their impact. The question to bitcoin is, how will these natural debt cycles and feedback loops be tempered without government interference? I've seen the argument here that it is government interference which causes the debt cycle in the first place. Now THAT is a gamble. If it's not true, then bitcoin will cause booms and busts to be inevitable and massive, creating not bubbles but explosions, and causing not dips but implosions.",

I do think it's important to note that the 1929-33 depression was caused by the credit expansion of the Fed in the 20s that brought on the boom before 1929 and the bust in 1929 and 30s. It lasted until 1939, not 1933. The economy slows, prices decrease and people are incentivized to save. What can help a depression is not more consumption, but, on the contrary, less consumption and more savings (and more investment). Falling prices encourage greater savings.\n\nFDR believed that the Depression was a result of under consumption, and artificially raised prices as well as wages. Raising wages and fucking with supply and demand actually caused more unemployment. Supply and demand were not allowed to make the price mechanism work the way it would in a free market, so employment, net investment, and production all faltered for a prolonged amount of time. Government action stopped prices to send the proper signals.\n\nThat book mentioned above is a free pdf and a great look into austrian business cycle theory. Cheers.",

As the courts have now affirmed and reaffirmed several times, police have no duty to protect. As such, police generally avoid any risk associated with keeping the public safe except where there's significant political pressure. Thus they become proactive and adopt active safety procedures only where there's a political mandate to do so. They still only do enough to satisfy that political demand at minimum risk to themselves.\n\n>Thus, the public is \"lulled\" into a false sense of security wherein we think we have an institution responsible for keeping us safe, but really have no such thing, instead just a weird quasi-political/para-military institution which spasmodically attempts to address public safety via violence and surveillance.\n\n>Second, police have largely co-opted the courts, taking it upon themselves to judge in the moment when and if a crime has been committed and thereby what corrective measures are appropriate. They're immunized from most consequences of getting it wrong and hailed as heroes when public opinion thinks they got it right. Courts basically never balk when police fail to properly process a case and render it to them for judgment as they're typically already overloaded/under-resourced, and have basically no ability to prosecute officers for violations except in the most egregious cases.\n\n>This second, expanded police powers/judge-jury-executioner function, is far more attractive to recruits looking for a power trip and forms both the core and increasingly the outer shell of police culture and practice, turbocharged by the history of the War on Drugs.\n\n>The end result is police officers basically entirely unwilling to expose themselves to risk for public safety, who just want to LARP as the Punisher or, more realistically just clock in day in, day out occasionally soaking up hero worship before retiring.\n\n>America's police forces have more in common with the former Afghan National Army than America's own military as far as willingness to perform their duty is concerned, and they predictably perform about as well.",

Value being \u201cenergy\u201d in my analogy. The contract is based on a nominal amount of units that have some  of that value in it. This is \u201cbattery shells\u201d in my analogy. \n\nLet\u2019s say you and I each have an xbox controller. These controllers require 2 AA batteries to be powered. I have 2 AA batteries that have enough energy to power this controller for 10 hours. You don\u2019t have any batteries, so I give you mine for tonight since I don\u2019t need them tonight, but you need to return 2 batteries to me with the same amount of energy that I loaned to you, so I am made whole. I still want my 10 hours of playtime. That would be an example of trading based on energy, rather than value. \n\nThe system we operate in is equivalent to me loaning you 2 batteries with 10 hours of xbox controller power and you paying me back with 2 batteries with less hours of controller power. You can do this because the contract wasn\u2019t based on the amount of energy the batteries contain, it was based on the number of batteries loaned.\n\nSo, instead of working at mcdonalds for 10 batteries an hour regardless of the energy in it, I should be working at mcdonalds for 10 batteries an hour with each battery having 5 hours of xbox controller power.",

If they need more L2 units of account, they simply change the translation algo, and call it a day.",

He wanted to hike it high enough to 1) stop the inflation, and 2) to make himself some room to lower the rate again when recession hit.\n\nThe inflation was his sh*t when he brrrrrrr last few years, now he wants to cover his as* by hiking rates. But by hiking rates he sh*ts recession; then wants to cover his recession as* later by lowering rates \u2026 eventually he will end up with the worst \u2014 stagflation.\n\nThe problem is this entire Bowel movement, I mean Powell, began when he started brrrrrrrr, and he just didn\u2019t recognize the world has changed and he was still using his very old school tactics to due with the current world. Fed has no weapons other then playing with the rates, but for that to work, he needs time. He needs time to hike the rate enough to slowly kill the inflation, and he then needs time to boost economy by lowering rates. Yet, we are live in a robust world with so many different options, people react so quickly that the rates simply won\u2019t do the job effective enough.\n\nIt actually makes Bitcoin the way for us to escape this government failure. Even the Fed wants to play down all crypto at this moment (as they have no control over it), as long as other countries, especially some developed country with freely traded currencies, allow Bitcoin, the Fed will have to face it and accept it.\n\nLosing USD to Bitcoin is not losing to another country, and it\u2019s much better than losing to other country such as China. AND Bitcoin is still largely held by US hodlers, so to certain extent US still has its grip on global economy. Just hope it won\u2019t be too late when they recognize that.",

There is nothing in this earthly world that man cannot do. How is it possible for a human being to live without food for 200 years, to hear all the 400-year-old ascetics? Most importantly, it controls the cells of its body. According to his researchers, he was able to activate only 30% of the brain! Man is able to do everything, you who say that costs do not go down, there is a management problem, it reaches a small percentage, with a complete and comprehensive plan, both the customer can be satisfied and a good profit can be made. Put some pressure on your brain in this regard, maybe you could solve the riddle\n \nOf course, I read half, I do not continue what is not in my mood\n                      \n                   Nadir",
