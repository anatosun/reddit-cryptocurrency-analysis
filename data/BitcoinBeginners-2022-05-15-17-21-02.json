Some metrics even show that the majority of mining is done on renewable energy.\n\nThis is why the narrative of \"bitcoin is killing the environment\" is false.\n\nEven with regularly supplied electricity, fossil fuels, some places energy is so costly that no it wouldn't be profitable to mine but other locations have very cheap energy making it profitable in those locations.",
