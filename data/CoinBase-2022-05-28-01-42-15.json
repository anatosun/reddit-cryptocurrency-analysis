            "selftext": "Hello! I am new to trading and such and I\u2019m afraid I might\u2019ve been scammed. Can someone please verify that BW as a trading platform is legit? I made profit this month on the platform and when I tried to withdraw, they told me my account was subject to a 10% tax fee on my earnings of the month. After speaking with my brother who has some knowledge on trading and such, he said he hasn\u2019t heard of this platform and that he found it strange that the \u201ctax\u201d had to be paid separately as they won\u2019t take it automatically from your earnings as coinbase does. I might be getting this all wrong, someone please help, I find little to no info online on the platform but last month I successfully withdrew about 100 bucks to test it. So now I\u2019m not sure if they are simply stalling due to the problems happening with bitcoin currently,or if I\u2019m straight up being scammed.",

Someone I\u2019m getting to know, which raises even sketchier energy lol i learned that the platform is based in Singapore though, but that makes me feel even more uneasy. The platform itself has been smooth sailing until this. But I found it so strange that I withdrew with no issues last month and now all of a sudden there\u2019s a \u201ctax\u201d? But I assumed it\u2019s because my profit was so much larger this month. Idk what to think. I feel stupid for even doing this at all without doing some more research beforehand",
