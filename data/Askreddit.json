            "text": "The Powerball\u2122 is a lottery offered by a total of 44 states (and a few other places) in the US. Recently, the jackpot for Powerball\u2122 grew to a record USD $1.3 Billion*. The next drawing for the Powerball\u2122 is on Wednesday January 13. The odds of winning this jackpot are 1 in 292,201,338. To put it in perspective, you are more likely to be elected president, or struck by lightning while drowning than you are to win the Powerball\u2122 Jackpot.\n\nPlease post top level comments as questions. To respond, reply to that comment as you would if it were a thread. This post will be in suggested sort: new so that new questions have equal exposure. We will be removing other posts about the Powerball\u2122 lottery (and lotteries in general) since the purpose of these megathreads is to put everything into one place.\n\n---\n\n*Other currencies (for your convenience):\n\n|Currency|Value|\n|:---|:---|\n|Euros|\u20ac1.19 Billion|\n|Canadian Dollar|CAN $1.84 Billion|\n|Chinese Yuan|\u00a58.53 Billion|\n|Indian Rupee|\u20b986.96 Billion|\n|British Pound|\u00a3895.29 Million|\n|Bitcoin|BTC 2.92 Million|\n|Zimbabwe Kwacha|ZMK 14.3 Trillion|\n|Dogecoin|\u00d07.937 Billion|",

Instead of working to pay rent I'd just be working to buy food and whatever gas is needed to get to work. That's like being given $15,000 a year for the rest of my life. As someone who's lived on under $20,000/year for most of his adult life that's an insane amount of money.\n\n\nI could go on an incredible vacation multiple times per year, or save up for a few years and then spend *years* traveling. Or I could skip the traveling and focus on finding a job that I really truly enjoy instead of one that pays enough to live on. Or I could work fewer hours and spend the rest of my life focusing on maximizing my happiness through hobbies. Or I could retire early. Or I could skip the condo and just get three university degrees (mine cost me $40k so that's a good estimate, sorry Americans with six figure degrees). I'm sure i could wrangle a high-paying career out of that.\n\nOne hundred thirty thousand dollars would be **goddamn life-changing**. \n\n\nAnd you know how much $130,000 is out of $1,300,000,000? (Let's also ignore the fact that I'm Canadian so I'd actually just be asking the winner for around $95K USD)\n\n\nIt's 0.01 percent. 0.01 percent of all the money I have in savings is less than a dollar. Would I expect a family member to give me less than a dollar if that dollar could be goddamn life-changing for me? Fuck, the Chinese takeout my family bought me on my birthday was like $15 and I damn well expected them to buy that for me (it's tradition! And also I'm poor!) ",

I spent the first few years partying, then started a couple of businesses and worked as a consultant part-time.  I'm pretty much retired now and live a nice but not extravagant lifestyle.  The payments end in a couple of years (this was before you could get lump sum) but I'm prepared to keep up this lifestyle for a while.\n\nThe experience has been like 98% positive-- I was raised to be pretty hard working and frugal, so even my wild times haven't been too out of control.  It's definitely given me the chance to chase some dreams and spend more time cultivating my relationships with friends and family.  So yeah, I definitely recommend winning the lottery!\n\nAnd yeah, I'm buying tickets for the Powerball.",

You likely live in and grew up in an area where crime is low to nonexistent.  \n\nIf you amassed your wealth over the course of your life (say, running a successful business), your network of friends is likely in a very similar position -- successful, wealthy people who have no need for your money since they have plenty of their own.   Any family members or old acquaintances from your \"pre-wealth\" days who would try to hit you up for money were probably cut out of your life a long time ago.  \n\nIn both of these cases, you most likely have the means, resources, and education necessary to manage and protect your money.  \n\nLottery winners do not have such resources.  You're talking about someone going from eating Ramen noodles to having a 9 figure bank account in the course of a day.  They have no idea how to manage their money.  They have no idea who to look for to help them manage their money, and have no idea if the \"financial planner\" they're talking to is reputable or a con artist himself.   Their financial advice is coming from their half-drunk uncle Jim.  \n\nTheir friends and family are still dirt poor, jealous, in some cases desperate.   They all have their hand out.  Give to one and everybody else wants a piece.  And they know how to find you.  They are more likely to come from higher crime areas, and would have no problems stabbing you in the back (literally and figuratively) if they believe they'll somehow get even a piece of your money.  \n\nThese people are much more likely to have family members who think that \"Hey, cousin bob just won the lottery! He's gonna help out all of us!\", and get pissed when he finds out that the winner's generosity doesn't extend to their creepy cousin that they see twice a year.   Or that crazy neighbor.  Maybe a couple of gang members from the 'hood, or their local pot dealer.  Or that friend that they *thought* they could trust, but is now suing them because they tripped on a stair, stubbed their toe, and are hoping you'll just settle quickly for a couple million.  \n\nAnd the most dangerous person a lottery winner has to face?  Themselves.  You're giving a person who likely can't even balance their checkbook properly a nine-figure bank account.   They have no idea how to handle that kind of money.  They do not have the experience or education necessary to handle that kind of money.  They do not have the knowledge necessary to hire the people needed to manage that kind of money vs. hiring someone who's working in their own best interests or is a straight-up con man.  They're diving head-first into a sea of money with cement shoes tied to their ankles.  It's not a surprise that a good chunk of these people drown.\n\n\n\n",

I don't care who you are or who you work for......here comes a guy wearing clothes that probably cost him less than you spent today on lunch.  He tells you that he now has hundreds of millions of dollars and clearly doesn't have the first clue how to manage said money and would have absolutely no way of knowing if you're taking him to the cleaners.  \n\nYou could literally rip this guy off for millions of dollars and he'd probably never even know, and could easily be long gone even if he did find out.

This is listed in powerball FAQ. Side note, the FAQ are worth looking up as they're written fairly entertainingly. \n\nAs far as how much you can get from the lower lump sum vs annuity, people always say you can invest the lump sum but they also forget you can invest the annuity as you get it as well. Think of it this way-the annuity is like you invest the lump sum in a way that is guaranteed to double over 30 years, and then you also get to invest each payment as you get it on top of that. \n\nWhen you run the numbers it ends up being really close depending on your state's tax rate, the amount of money you plan to spend, and the investment interest rate you think you can get. It really ends up being a decision of whether you can trust yourself with all the money at once. ",

Assuming you bought every possible permutation (292,201,338 * $2/chance), you'd spend $584,402,676.  You still have to account for taxes on your winnings, and for you to be the only winning ticket holder (otherwise you're splitting it).  So, even at double the highest drawing it's ever been at, it's still a huge risk that you'll break even.",

Facebook would be the first thing to go, then probably this reddit account. So if this account gets deleted on Thursday, you know why. All of my account passwords would be changed to something significantly more challenging then they are now for no reason other then early on-set paranoia. \n\nThen I would secure a lawyer. I'd probably go to des moines and find a lawyer for a national law firm and make sure I'm working with a partner at that firm and not some JR Lawyer. I want the full attention and professionalism of somebody near the top. Get trusts setup for family, I would also secure legal services for them because shits about to get messy. Establish a PO Box and then wait. Why wait? I'm not in any sort of Hurry at this point. \n\nAbout 3 months after my numbers were drawn I'd cash in. During those 3 months I'd worth with my lawyer, a real-estate agent, and a contractor to coordinate the building of a new home. This may be tricky without money up front for designs and whatnot but I'll try my best. I then have a giant moving sale at my place advertising that I'm moving across the country or something and don't want to take anything but some clothes with me. Box up the stuff I would like to keep (personal items) ahead of time and store them for safe keeping. Maybe have this sale going for a week or so in the spring when all the good garage sales are in progress. \n\nNow the day has finally come. It's april or may at this point. I quit my job ( I don't want to but I know I couldn't keep working with the amount of harassment is coming my way) and head off to Clive IA to collect my winnings. Since I know my information is going public the next steps are key. I cash out, my name and face is plastered all over the place and my contact information is public record. I cash the check with my lawyer and divvy up trusts to those designated family members. I then cut a check to the construction company to break ground on the house, setup my brother or dad to act on my behalf for the construction of the home. pay all my debts. Lock the doors and sit infront my door with a shotgun all night.\n\nNext day I sell my car, hire a contractor to remodel my current home. Shotgun infront of the door is now done in shifts. Purchase plane tickets and leave. I'd just travel around the world for about 6mo-1yr. Likely wouldn't spend more then 2 weeks in any one location. When I came back I would sell my old home, go to my new home which will be fully furnished, nice gate around it. At this point things would start to suck. Year 2 would be one of the worst as I try to manage the constant harassment and requests for money. ",

My first is why would a lawyer agree to pick up your check? Won't they know that they might possibly be at risk as well if their face is shown?\n\n\nSecond, what stops a lawyer from taking your winning ticket and claim the money as his/hers. I'm guessing some sort of contract would have to be made to prevent this.\n\n\nLastly, if you can't afford one of the best lawyers how would it be possible to pay them before having access to your money? Do you just tell them \"hey can you pick up my check in about 3 months when things have cooled and I promise I'll pay you then\".",

The Multi-State Lottery Association will query their records, and if it finds no winning numbers purchased, the next drawing will be on Saturday.

To be clear, I won't use your comments in my story without talking to you directly about it first, and getting your name and other basic information just to identify you in our work. I've already reached out to the moderators to ask permission to post this thread. If you want to talk outside this thread, you're welcome to pm me or email me at ogarcia@ap.org.\n\nAbove all, thanks for your insight!",

I have always assumed anything that is transmitted on the internet can and may be intercepted.  As such I've always maintained all my data myself.  Cloud storage?  Nope.  If I need a cloud I will set up my own Owncloud server with verified credentials, use https and/or ssh tunnels. I use Linux, but short of writing all the code myself, I have to trust somebody at some point.  Is there a backdoor someplace along the line?  Maybe, but having the source code open to audit decreases the likelyhood.\n\nFacebook?  Yes, use it, but only post things that I don't mind if my mom sees :-).  Everything else I consider information leakage, like when I am away from my home (vacation), when I am out, when I am in.  If I go on vacation, facebook doesn't get that information until well after I am back.  I don't know who is profiling me/us and I consider information on a need to know basis.  I don't use encrypted email, because it is inconvenient for my recipients.  Again, I consider email to be insecure and as such, no credit cards, passwords, or information of a contextually or temporally sensitive nature.\n\nI think the biggest weak points are credit card records, purchasing profiles etc.  I don't like that fact that Amazon and credit card companies probably turn over everything.  I assume they do, and I don't think there's much I can do about it.  I certainly am not going to go off grid, just on the off chance that my purchasing habits are being profiled.\n\nMy biggest concern is that this information is being hoarded for use at a later date.  I can imagine corporations and politicians paying top dollar for information on their rivals to either embarrass or gain an advantage over them.  Being a little older than most redditers, I come across people all the time who brag about knowing someone in the FBI or other government organization.  I can imagine a friend getting inside information on someone else in order to gain an advantage in some way.  Hey, dude, can you do me a favor.  I need some dirt on my ex-wife to get custody of my kids.  You're my friend, right?  Remember, your government organization is only as strong as your lowliest desk clerk.  Bradly Manning and Edward Snowden were not top officials, yet they had access to very sensitive information.  If they had wanted to destroy someone or enrich themselves, they could have.\n\nShort of going off-grid, I don't think there's much you can do.  Of course, going off-grid makes you even more of a target of scrutiny, doesn't it.",

The computer works on it, and submits the results.\n\nSome diseases are caused by proteins that fold improperly (Alzheimer's, Huntington's, Parkinson's, etc). Folding@Home provides more information about the structure of these proteins, as well as possible drugs that may interact with them. \n\n[Even back in 2008](http://folding.typepad.com/news/2008/12/new-fah-results-on-possible-new-alzheimers-drug-presented.html) they gained results from the program that could possibly help with Alzheimer's. Basically there is a specific protein that is bad for you when you have Alzheimer's. By moving it around a bunch they figured out that a certain drug could possibly disable it. There are many other things they have done, but that's just one example.\n\n(Also, your ex wasn't a very good biology student if she didn't realize the potential of a program like this.

And that's not counting the hours off the life of your capacitors and system.\n\n**Edit:**\n\n New York costs $0.181 per kilowatthour. 24/7 computer costs $47 per month\n\nCalifornia costs $0.152 per kilowatthour. 24/7 computer costs $40 per month\n\nHawaii is $0.332 per kilowatthour. 24/7 computer costs $86 per month\n\nLondon is \u00a30.179 per kilowatthour. 24/7 computer costs \u00a347 per month\n\n[Source](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/10/27/141766341/the-price-of-electricity-in-your-state)\n\n**Edit 2:**\n\nBased off these numbers, the best way to earn/save money with your powerful computer is to turn it off. \n\n**Edit 3:** \n\n[This system admin](http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/how-to-get-rich-on-bitcoin-by-a-system-administrator-who-s-secretly-growing-them-on-his-school-s-computers) uses 15 computers at his job to mine for bitcoins without his company knowing. He makes 60 bit coins a year, or 4 per computer. A bitcoin is worth $7 so he makes $28 a year off each computer which uses $360 in electricity for each computer each year. (granted i'm assuming they are powerful i7 computers and working 24/7 with no other purpose) **Subedit** - Article is 2 years old. Bitcoin is now worth $110 per coin.  So if he still has a job, he makes $400 a year off $360 in electricity for each computer.\n",

It's just that the US government was the world's leading supplier for most of the 20th century.

Some private suppliers have stepped up, but are not likely to produce enough to bring the market prices back down since helium reserves represent a huge up front investment for a long term return, and they're making money hand over fist at the moment, and will receive less profit per unit if they spend too much on a new reserve.

My goal is to reach LA without spending a single dollar. So far I haven't had any car troubles, till now. I'm in a Safeway parking lot at 28th and Arapahoe in Boulder. I have a donut but no jack. My firebird is really low so the jack point is only about 4-5\" above the ground - I probably need a floor jack. Can anyone help me get one, or pay for me to be towed and repaired? I will pay you back with Bitcoins at the exchange rate of 8.25 BTC = 1USD. Email me at plato at subvert.me or DM me on twitter @TheRealPlato to get in touch with me instantly, I'll keep an eye on this thread too.\n\nThanks guys,\n\n-PLATO",

The recent hack of the largest Bitcoin exchange isn't helping.\n\nBeyond that, many have speculated that the Bitcoin market is being managed as a pump-and-dump scheme. People who got in early have *huge* stockpiles of Bitcoins which they hope to sell once prices get high enough. Because the trading volume is so low, these big investors can easily manipulate the market with only a fraction of their holdings.\n\n> What do people use it for?\n\nIllegal/illicit transactions, mostly. The anonymous drug market Silk Road seems to be the one place you can trade Bitcoins for real products, but last I checked the prices were pretty high. And it's a probable that some of the users on there are FBI agents. In fact, the Silk Road itself might be operated by the FBI.",

The probability to find such hash is 1/2 (2^255 / 2^256 ). For any given difficulty the probability equals 1/2 ^ (leading zero bits, LZB).\n\nInitial bitcoin difficulty (used when first blocks were generated) was 32 LZB. Its single hash probability was 0.5^32 or 1/4294967296. One should calculate 2^32 hashes for 50% hit probability.\n\nLess significant bits could be used to fine adjust difficulty. Current difficulty of 8078 (times initial difficulty) is described as (44LZB)1000000111001101001(remaining zero bits to 256). It requires 2^32 * 8078 hashes for 50% hit probability.\n\nBitcoin real time parameters are available at [blockexplorer](http://blockexplorer.com/q)",

                    "response": "Hi /u/TheTrashDad,\n\nI'll try to explain in three points why I think Bitcoin is a big deal.\n\nBitcoin is the first solution to a long-standing problem in computer science which has (until now) prevented the existence of a functioning \"digital cash\" system. It's known as the [Byzantine General's Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance), which, loosely stated, describes the difficulty of getting distributed nodes to reach consensus while *not* being able to trust each others messages.\n\nWhat does this mean in a practical, real-world sense for us?\n\n1. The Bitcoin network grants the ability to send *any amount* of money anywhere on the planet, *instantly*, for no fee (well, around 1 cent). Even better, it:\n\n    a. Clears in around 10 seconds\n\n    b. Confirms (can be fully trusted) in about 1 hour\n\n    c. Cannot be stopped/frozen\n\n2. Bitcoin cannot be artificially inflated (devalued) by printing more of it. There is a hard-coded limit to the amount of Bitcoins that can exist (21 million). They're released slowly over time. And before you say \"but 21 million isn't enough!\" remember that a single Bitcoin can be infinitely subdivided  (think of a stock split), so there isn't practically a limitation in number of units available.\n\n3. Bitcoin is a push system, vs. a pull system like credit/debit/ACH. This means you must \"push\" the money to your recipient, and your recipient can't later \"pull\" money from you like in the current system. Hacks like the Target data breach don't work with Bitcoin. Now there *are* other vulnerabilities (like in any system), but widespread massive identity loss is impossible with Bitcoin.\n\nThere are a lot of other benefits but I don't want to bore you. Hopefully this is a good primer.\n\nJust remember: in the end, all money is just essentially a giant ledger system, keeping track of who owes who how much. Bitcoin is just a digital version of a gigantic Excel spreadsheet detailing the account balances of everyone using it.",

You can push a button and send a quadrillion dollars from one place to another just like that. Moving to a cryptocurrency is just a matter of dispensing with the formalities of hard currency.\n\nC) Dispensing with the formalities of hard currency can be tricky, people like holding hard cash. The Fed has to allot for it when it's calculating the effects of OMOs. I used to be a server. Getting hard cash was a joy to me, because it was all tax free. Now this will be a little shady......but a lot of people use that principle of the service industry to launder drug money. You just declare your drug earnings as tips, and deposit it worry free. A move from hard/electronic hybrid currency to crypto currency is gonna cause some interesting ripple effects my friends. Very interesting indeed...",

I have a system to maintain this for myself, but in case of my permanent inability to share this information with someone, those accounts are permanently locked. \n\nNow, I'm as healthy as an apple a day, but accidents can happen, so how would I go about creating a system in which my next of kin would gain access _only_ in the case where I am permanently unable to disclose that information at will?\n\nI would prefer a system which is not based on trust, meaning I wouldn't like a \"Last will\" stored with a lawyer or anything like that. I don't want to depend on any service or person being available nor any company being solvent (this may be relevant in 50 or 100 years). \n\nI want a system that can be frequently updated with new information. For passwords alone, I have 10-15 patterns which I use to generate unique passwords for perhaps hundreds of services, with more appearing daily or weekly. And that's just for passwords. \n\nI can't give this information to my wife now because I have no idea whether she'll be able to use the information. It may just as well be that we both expire in a plane crash. \n\nI've briefly discussed this already, and to answer a few questions to clarify:\n\n- I need to think long-term (let's say up to 100 years) because an accident may leave me in a coma for any amount of time, and I do not want to trust anyone to determine whether I will eventually wake up as if nothing happened.\n\n- I don't want an 'app' or service because although these services may have the best of intention or even be around in 100 years, given that amount of time, any security system is likely going to be broken. \n\n- In a perfect system, I would be able to define rules of disclosure. For example, if I land in a coma for 5 months, I want a certain piece of information, for example a certain set of passwords or private keys to money, to be released to my wife, but only if she is still alive and can utilize the information. However, she should not get access to my email, if such a thing exists at that time, until 10 years have passed. \n\nSo... In short... How do 'modern' people prepare for disaster?",

            "text": "EDIT: Some history below. \n\nMy mother was pregnant with me for about 4 months, during the Iran vs Iraq war. During the time she was pregnant, she was literally a mile away from rockets and missiles bombing her city, which threw her and her family flying in her house. She was scared to death and crying most of the time. I mention this fact because I think that it might have caused me to have anxiety from birth.\n\nMy anxiety started back when I was 14 years old. I remember being in my cousins house, watching them play video games on the N64, while I sat on the couch eating gummy worms. My mother and aunt were chatting with each other, and it seemed like a normal day. \n\nAll of a sudden, I had a tingling feeling in my hands, feet, and stomach. Soon I started to feel anxious, scared, and even started to hyperventilate. I got a small erection, but it felt as though my muscles were tensing up and I couldn't control my body function. I started to throw up and cry in panic. And I slowly started to shrivel up. My mother was so scared that she drove me to our family doctor. On the way there, I was in the back, gagging to throw up but I had nothing left in me. My hands and feet became numb, and I could barely catch my own breathe.\n\nAs soon as we got there, my doctor tried to see what was wrong with me but I couldn't even lay down. My stomach felt like it was clenching into a fist. So he sent us to the emergency hospital. When we got to the hospital, they put me down on the list and gave me a wheel chair to sit in while I waited for them to help me. I felt so nauseous and sick from it all, that I had to use the bathroom and poop it all out. After that, I felt a lot better and things calmed down. \n\nTwo hours pass by and they finally help me. They take me in, do the regular procedural stuff and put me on a bed. They stick an IV in me and after that, I don't remember them doing much. All I remember is some lady coming and asking me some questions. I stayed the entire night, and once I was out, they diagnosed me with \"too much gas\".\n\nThis happened to me about 2 more times later on down the years, when I was 17 and 20. The second time it happened to me was when I started taking Accutane for my acne. I stopped taking it after the first 6 months because it literally felt like it changed how I felt on te inside. My stomach and body do not feel the same at all anymore, and I am very sensitive to foods since then. The last time it happened, I was home playing World of Warcraft, when all of a sudden I started to puke and poop out everything I ate the night prior (I got food poisoning from the food the night before). I begged my parents to take me to the hospital. They charged five thousand dollars for what I just explained up above. They even told me that they couldn't help me if I didn't pay some of the money up front. I didn't have any insurance, and my parents believe that everyone should pay their own debt. But anyway, that's a different story.\n\nAfter my last visit to the hospital, my parents took me to a psychiatrist who charged me 100 dollars every visit, and would basically tell me to lay down and \"let me know what's on your mind\". I really felt awkward and didn't feel like saying anything. And whatever I said was in agreement with what he thought about what I said. In the end, he prescribed me Alprazolam (5mg Xanax) and I took one anytime I had any anxiety. This helped me out a few times, but the more time passed on by, the more it went from me taking it only when I needed it, to me taking it once every night (which I do now). \n\nEven with me taking Xanax at nights, I would still have episodes during the morning or afternoon. So my parents decided to take me to a Psychologist this time. And this man suggested I do Neuro-feedback Therapy. NFT in a nutshell is them sending positive feedback to your brain to eliminate negative thoughts, and they do this by strapping you to a machine while you play video games that reward you for doing stuff. I did this for 6 months. And it actually helped me a bit. He also spoke to me about some of the aspects in my life. This man was a good talker, so it actually relieved me to share some of my experiences with him.\n\nIn those years, up until just 3 months ago, I worked at IKEA. Over at IKEA, I made some really good friends, which I never really had before. It was a part time job, and since I didn't go to school, it was more of a social bonding experience than work to me. I went to work every day and people talked to me, laughed with me, argued with me, and generally I was part of something.\n\nOn my birthday night, I met my would be girlfriend. And we have been together for 9 months. Everything is going great, as I've confessed my love for her. She really is the perfect girl for me. But I slowly started to not hang out with my friends anymore. And most of them have stopped contacting me, especially my best friend.\n\nEver since then, I have gotten a new job, and gone back to school. And I still take Xanax once every night, and I still have episodes here and there. Also, over the past year, I have joined in on Reddit and have learned, laughed, and shared some awesome stuff on this site.\n\nNow I'm writing to you guys because for some reason, I see Reddit as the biggest help out there on the internet. From what I've read, this site carries one of the most brilliant minds out there. And some of the warmest hearts. Even the trolls! (which I have to admit, I sometimes am) I might not get any responses, and I honestly don't care getting karma or front page stuff for this topic. I just wanted to get all of this out there.\n\nBut if you do read this, and if you do comment... what do you make out from all of this?\n\nI'm sorry for the wall of text, Reddit. And I also want to thank you.",

You seem to thrive on the attention of your parents and therapists which is fairly unhealthy by itself but couple that with your drug dependence...\n\nGet off Reddit and go experience life for a change.  Your parents hopefully won't let you live at home forever and you might as well make the transition before they boot you out.",
