However, the issue NFT bros like to ignore is that just like anytime you buy art - that doesn't mean the artist has sold you the rights to their art, so A) They totally could sell another copy, as any conventional artist could after selling a painting, nonfungible is laughable bullshit and B) That doesn't mean you own the IP that is the art, it means you own that piece, you can't neccesarily use it as say, your business logo without their permission",
