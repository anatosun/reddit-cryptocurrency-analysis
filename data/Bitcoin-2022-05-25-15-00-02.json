They charge 20% on loans while providing you 0.02% interest for letting them leverage your money for those loans. When they fail to invest properly, they default but instead of collapsing, the central government bails them out.\n\nAll related to money printer go brrrrrrr.\n\nIf money printer stopped printing, they would have to be more responsible with your money. So as it should be, you work, you get paid, your labor holds its value, you buy things you need/want but your savings is protected. Unfortunately with fiat that's not the case. Your labor is worth less every minute that passes after you get paid. So banks pay you a sliver of a portion they're baking off debt to others to incentivise you not to immediately spend your inflating garbage currency. Bitcoin fixes this. You can literally just set it and forget and watch while everything else gets more expensive yet Bitcoin buying power offsets those other expenses over time.",

You're lending Bitcoin, and usually for lent-out cryptocurrencies aren't insured - you're not lending for \"reliability\" because of the risk you are incurring from losing your Bitcoin.\n\nRather than directly mentioning services, I'd advise you to look through the market so that you get a good idea of the average APY, and then make a decision. But again by lending out your BTC, you should accept the fact that you could lose that Bitcoin",

If it was only a buy and sell option ? When they short , they short big.  They borrow in bulk.   This is why you see those crazy instant drops out of nowhere.  They see that there isn't much in the order book, or \"buying pressure\", then sell tons of coins all at once. \n\nPlease spread the word.  Those APY paying platforms do not have our best interest , they bank on the fees ,  obviously don't give a shit a out the price.",
