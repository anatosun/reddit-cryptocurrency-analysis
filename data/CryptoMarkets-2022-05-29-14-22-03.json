After all, Terra Classic (LUNC-USD) is now trading for less than a penny. This project was among the most valuable projects in the world just weeks ago.\n\nThe launch of Terra 2.0 brings about a new ecosystem, without the now-notorious algorithmic stablecoin. The old LUNA crypto now trades as LUNC, also taking on a new name, Terra Classic.\n\nWrapped LUNA Classic, or WLUNC, is a derivation of the LUNA token, which allows it to be traded on the Ethereum (ETH-USD) blockchain. Accordingly, this token has gained some attention, as there still may be use cases for wrapped LUNA on Ethereum. Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem is the largest in the crypto world. Perhaps some demand will provide upward mobility for this overlooked crypto.\n\nIm heavy in ETH, MATIC, WLUNA, and the relatively new coin RBIF  r/roboinu\n\nCheers and best of luck.",

Price dumps asides, the quality of developments that were going on in the blockchain, especially with tfm powering it prior to the Luna crash should not be overlooked. By any chance, if there is a way for them to come back on board and keep delivering at top level, it's worth it.",
