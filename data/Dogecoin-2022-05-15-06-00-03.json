Now I\u2019m at half of my original investment and feeling the stress of our upcoming wedding expenses. My fianc\u00e9 and I are paying for everything ourselves, mostly relying on my savings. We wanted to have a somewhat nice wedding because all of my family and friends will be traveling from quite far away to celebrate with us. Now I\u2019m here searching for used wedding dresses and how to make diy decor/flower arrangements at midnight because I just want to make this work for us. \n\nAnyway, that being said, I\u2019m holding. But hopeful that the universe will help this girl out soon.",
