            "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI was wondering if a viable attack vector on BTC would be a miner collusion to alter the POW difficulty. As far as I understand it, the puzzle difficulty is adjusted roughly every 2 weeks, while \"the upper limit for each difficulty epoch is a +300% change, while the lower is a -75% alteration. This rule is put in place to eliminate any abrupt changes in mining difficulty.\"\n\nWhile mining is to some extent distributed we can all assume that because of economics of scale a majority of the hash power is concentrated among a few large miners (see below). Suppose, these mining pools collude to shut down their mining right on time for a difficulty adjustment. The hash power will drop significantly but not more -75% every two weeks. Say the miners shut down for 1 month and difficulty will fall by a cumulative 94%.\n\nWhen miners then resume the hash power will increase very fast and far exceed the current difficulty level. Block time will be much faster than 10 minutes, hence more block and more block rewards. If difficulty increases by 300% in the subsequent 2 adjustment periods difficulty will still only be 50% of the initial difficulty after 2 adjustments.\n\nThe back of the envelope math goes as follows:\n\n**Week 0: Difficulty level: 100 --> miners collude and shut down --> hash rate drops significantly**\n\n**Week 2: Difficulty level drops at max. -75% --> 100 x 0.25 = 25**\n\n**Week 4 Difficulty level again drops at max. -75% --> 25 x 0.25 = 6.25 (down from 100) --> Miners ramp up and start mining far below a 10 minute block time as the hash rate far exceeds current difficulty**\n\n**Week 6: Difficulty level adjusts upward at max. + 300% --> 6.25 x 3 = 18.75 --> block time still far below 10 minutes**\n\n**Week 8: Difficulty level adjusts upward at max. + 300% --> 18.75 \\* 3 = 56.25 (still down from 100)**\n\n**Week 10: Difficulty adjustment catches up.**\n\nMiners could exploit weeks 2 to 10 and mine many more blocks than just one every 10 minutes, thereby stealing profits from the future supply schedule.\n\nCan someone please debunk this?!\n\n*Annotation: Obviously this attack comes with the opportunity cost of not mining blocks for lets say 4 weeks but the back of the envelope math suggests mining this way would be more profitable as blocks rewards from the future could be stolen by decreasing the block time far below the 10 minute goal. Secondly, this wouldn't \"break\" Bitcoin as the total supply is still capped at 21 million but it would corrupt the supply schedule.*\n\n[Hashpower by mining pool \\(https:\\/\\/www.coindesk.com\\/layer2\\/miningweek\\/2022\\/03\\/26\\/is-miner-concentration-once-again-jeopardizing-bitcoin-not-exactly\\/\\)](https://preview.redd.it/2zdrbo1ll8091.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=02af597467833a70224233a145ea03cb22d9e08b)",

                    "response": "The interval between difficulty adjustments is measured in blocks, not in actual time. When there's a block every 10 minutes (on average), this 2016 block interval will be exactly 2 weeks.\n\nIn your scheme, once the colluding miners stop their hardware, the rate of new blocks being found will decrease and the time until the next difficulty adjustment will increase. Suppose 75% of the miners (measured by hash power) collude. That means the difficulty adjustment interval will be 8 weeks instead of 2. During these 8 weeks, non-colluding miners will continue to earn income at the normal rate, while colluding miners earn nothing.\n\nWhen the difficulty has dropped and the colluding miners rejoin the network, the next difficulty adjustment will come much sooner than 2 weeks. It'll come once 2016 blocks have been mined.\n\nNote that in your calculation, you've only counted a 200% maximum increase. A +300% change is a factor 4 as a multiplier. This is symmetric with the maximum decrease in difficulty (factor of 1/4).\n\nSo if colluding miners spend 1 difficulty adjustment interval not mining and 1 interval catching up, by the end of those 2 difficulty intervals, the difficulty is back to where it was. But with the numbers I used above (75% hashrate controlled by colluding miners), that means this period lasts for 8.5 weeks. During this, non-colluding miners mined 2016 + 0.25 * 2016 = 2520 blocks while colluding miners mined 0.75 * 2016 = 1512 blocks.\n\nWithout the attack, over the same period of 8.5 weeks (so 8.5 / 2 adjustment intervals) non-colluding miners would've mined 8.5 / 2 * 2016 = 2142 blocks while colluding miners would mine 6426 blocks.\n\nThis is for the shortened scenario where colluding miners only turn off their equipment for 1 adjustment cycle. They can repeat it for multiple cycles like in your example and the numbers will change, but the conclusion remains the same.\n\nSo the proposed attack would negatively impact the miners who participate in it while it would benefit the miners who keep mining. Once again demonstrating that Bitcoin financially incentivizes players to play by the rules.",
