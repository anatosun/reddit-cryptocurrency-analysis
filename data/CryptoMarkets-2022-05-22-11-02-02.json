But one of the most important functions of POW is Blockchain authentication.  When a new node first connects to the network, the next thing it must do is identify the correct Blockchain.  POW makes this easy because the genuine Blockchain has more work put into it than any fake can match.  Staking doesn't do that so POS blockchains require a different, and probably less secure, method of authentication.",
