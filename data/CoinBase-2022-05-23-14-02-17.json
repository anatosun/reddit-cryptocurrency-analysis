Extremely suspicious.  \n\n\nI start a case, it gets closed by your team with no assistance what so ever. Pretty suspicious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI start another case, it gets closed again by your team with no assistance. Very Suspicious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery time I call, I get no information on this other than \"a team is looking into it\" can't contact this team though and they'll apparently reach out by email, oh but look, the case gets closed. It kind of feels like I'm being lied to.   \n\n\nI create a formal complaint but all you do is point me to 7.1 from the TC. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat the hell is going on here. Do you expect me to sit and die like a good dog while you steal my life savings, blocking me out of them and closing all my support cases? Just avoiding communication or support me in any way what so ever?  Or is someone actually going to communicate with me.",

Poor dude has heard all this shit before. \n\nAlso, most new crypto users typically don't understand the concept of custodial vs non-custodial wallet, or that your balance on a CEX like coinbase is basically an IOU. Does that mean they deserve to lose it all? If you think so, then I would argue that *you* deserve to lose it all - because we all need mainstream adoption of crypto. Which means, new entrants who aren't all CS experts. You trying to humiliate them is not doing yourself, nor me, any favors, so just keep scrolling.\n\nSo my dude u/QuestofMiren, Coinbase and all centralized exchanges do this every crash. Likely because they don't have enough liquidity to service everyone panicking at once. The short-term fix, unfortunately, is to just sit tight for a while.\n\nIf you are worried about crypto sinking further, you may be able to at least convert it to USDC (at least \"on paper\" in their database) - but when this happens you often can't get anything out depending on the specific asset, i.e. transfer to a real address or cash out to your bank account. Because they just don't have the asset on-hand.\n\nAnd they won't answer the phone because, what are they going to say? \"Sorry we don't have the money?\" Fuck no, that would make everything worse! So they just pretend to not be home until their friend Jerry pays them back for the drugs from last week. And give you \"mysterious error messages\" when you try to cash out.\n\nIt happens every crash.\n\nSo that's the short-term fix, which I'm sorry isn't great, but at least you almost certainly haven't lost your life-savings, long-term.\n\nThe long-term fix is much of what some of the jerkwads are bleating about, but with more empathy:\n\n- Once you get this problem fixed, in general never leave too much money on Coinbase or any centralized exchange. Only use it to move money in or out, to one or ideally more wallets you control the keys to. (I.e. a software wallet like Exodus, and/or Metamask, and/or hardware wallet like Trezor.)\n    - You *can* use CEXes for cheap and rapid trading (ironically *because* trades aren't committed to any blockchain), just don't do it with any more money at a time than you can afford to have suddenly frozen randomly for days or weeks at a time and possibly lose much of the value of during that time.\n\nSo, good luck. Coinbase did this to me many years ago, also when I was new. It was scary. Fortunately it wasn't *too* much money. Kraken did the same thing more recently, not even during a crash. (But notoriously over Monero liquidity.) Coinbase is worse than Kraken, but none are innocent. Binance is just an outright scam.",

They are accountable, believe me.  \n\nThat being said, and I hope this post ages well, I trust CB. They\u2019ve never done anything crippling or long term hazardous to me and I\u2019ve been with them almost since the beginning (I\u2019m not American, and have had 6 figures sitting in their custody) Sit tight bro.

What actions have I done to disqualify my victimhood. I've been using coinbase completely fine for years, and out of no where I'm blocked with stone cold silence? Why am I to blame here?  \n\n\nI want to make it clear that my frustration lies with the lack of communication. I was frustrated on the actual day they blocked it, but it clearly said \"temporary\" it could've been some sort of security reason, so I thought \"hey, it is what it is, but it will be back on within a day or so\" I was definitely not expecting to not know a thing about what is happening and to be treated with not just silence, but complete rejection with them closing my cases. **What am I to think here if this is what I'm being met with?**",

I use coinbase and others frequently, but they never have my life savings. Wake up, mate. We're not talking about Blackrock or The Vanguard Group here; we're talking about the crypto world. As exchanges go, CB is more reliable than most. But, it's still a crypto exchange...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They have my assets and they're not allowing me access to my account\n\nThey have your assets because you gave them custodial control over your assets (your \"life savings\", actually).  You've already said that they're a \"reputable company\", so there's likely a reputable reason they've locked your account temporarily.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>why should I \"know better\"\n\nWhy should you know better than to put your entire \"life savings\" at great risk and under the custodial control of a crypto exchange ? Why should you know better than to keep a large amount of coin in a crypto exchange?  I can't help you if you don't understand the basic reasoning behind that. Do some research before you invest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>does every single coinbase user log on to buy and then immediately move their assets?\n\nMany do exactly that and most would never leave more than they were willing to lose (or lose access to) on any single exchange.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>your saying that everyone that doesn't do this is to blame for using a globally recognised and supposedly trusted company?\n\nIt's \"you're\" and what I'm saying is you're at fault here for giving any crypto exchange complete control of an investment so large that losing access to it places you in financial jeopardy. CB may be at fault for errors or slow, inept support, but you put yourself in this position. I do not accept that you're a victim of anything other than your own actions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What am I to think here if this is what I'm being met with?\n\nCB has a long reputation of slow support response. You are no different. You could reasonably conclude that their silence is not some deep conspiracy, but rather just inept support and a lethargic resolution process. A rash decision on your part does not constitute an emergency for coinbase. They'll get to you when they get to you. Ranting and threatening them will not endear you to them. You'll only get referred to Section 7 of the User Agreement.\n\nI once sent a moderately large amount of coin to an exchange wallet. It got lost. The exchange support eventually said they'd be happy to help, but it might take 4-6 weeks. It took 8, but I got my coin back. A bit of patience and no drama helped.\n\nI'm not defending CB or any crypto exchange. They may well have no reason whatsoever for locking your account. It may indeed be a tragic act of incompetence on their part.  It's unfortunate and while I'm not devoid of all sympathy for your situation, you voluntarily placed yourself in this precarious position and you should've known better. Perhaps now you do.",
