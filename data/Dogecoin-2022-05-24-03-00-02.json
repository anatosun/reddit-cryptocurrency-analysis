Unlike exchanges for example where everything is hidden offchain on private ledgers.\n\nSo, you register on the website or by messaging the bot. Then you really want to grab your keys off the website. Because this means you can handle the wallet yourself like any other text wallet if the bot is down.\n\nThen it\u2019s just a matter of funding the wallet, sending and/or receiving tips. If you end up with a fortune in there that you want to sell, then you can move the coins yourself using coinb.in, since you have the keys. Pretty easy, really.\n\nDo search Reddit for \u2018text wallet\u2019 and have a read.",
