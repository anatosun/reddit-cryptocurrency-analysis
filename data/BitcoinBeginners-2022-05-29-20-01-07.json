            "selftext": "I know absolutely nothing about Bitcoin but I figured I\u2019d come here to get my question answers. My friend made an instagram post about making $10,000 in a couple of hours after investing only $1,000 into Bitcoin. She also posted an image showing the balance of her bank account. \n\nMy friend told me that she had someone trade her money for her so I got in touch with the person responsible for trading. The following is the message I got from the trader:\n\n\u201cThis is how it works you have to purchase bitcoin then I will send you the company master broker wallet to send the bitcoin and after I will send you a link to your broker account to see how your trade is going, your profit balance will be there and also withdraw after 3 hours of mining\u201d\n\nIs this a scam?",
