It would greatly lower the cost for Gemini of loaning Bitcoin when they are using other people\u2019s coin, and Blackrock/Citadel won\u2019t be able to harvest on the shorts from the dip in BTC they created. In this. Without the profit from the short Blackrock/Citadel simply won\u2019t do it.\n\nEven if governments really want to collapse the crypto market, they can\u2019t do it by vaporizing their own money, especially under current economic situation.
