It is very hard to climb from the current market share all the way to top 10 not to mention to become the biggest crypto. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for these years.

Centralized.**\n>>\n>> **trakums:** WHAT'S WRONG WITH BIG HUBS? They still obey all Bitcoin rules and can not prevent....\n\n\nA reason for large hubs is they make the routing problem far more tractable, and seem to arise naturally.\n\n\nBut most of your later replies involve a more decentralized evenly distributed p2p mesh which is a far less tractable problem and importantly as pointed out by LovelyDayHere **not what we see in the real World** and hence why that first statement of yours is on shaky ground - LN routing with everybody connected to a single super hub obviously works regardless of network size, at the other end of the scale where we have just a p2p mesh of users with say 5 connections each - at some network size routing becomes a real problem. as noted (2017) by Rusty Russel (Blockstreams Lightning Guy)\n\n\n>> **Rusty Russel:** All channel updates are broadcast to everyone. How badly that will suck depends on how fast updates happen, **but it's likely to get painful somewhere between 10,000 and 1,000,000 channels.** [link](https://archive.ph/UnTnX#selection-1937.0-1937.187)\n\n\nI will attempt to address your points regardless\n\n\n> $62 changes nothing.

[link](https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1133735055115866112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n\nAnd he's on your side!\n\n\n> And 62$ are far away. \n\n\nYou do know that the most Maxi of Bitcoin Maxi's (rBitcoin F\u00fchrer) only six years ago thought that a $1 fee was [unthinkable](https://archive.is/2LEcO#selection-2075.0-2075.291) enough to comment that '**a hard fork to 2MB would be a no brainer**'\n\n\n\n> And I believe my node will be able to migrate to dark-net without closing my open channels when something as dumb as KYC nodes happen. \n\n\nIf you are connected to a KYC node how do you close (migrate) that channel and open up another one with a different channel partner say, Mr Random behind tor without an on chain fee involved?\n\n\n> **The possibility of nodes going dark** will prevent even a slightest chance of implementing KYC because that would make situation even worse for those who wanted it in the first place. \n\n\nYou have to explain how nodes going dark can happen without incurring the prohibitive on chain fee (by design) before this becomes a real threat add in the fact that finding a route through an inherently dark network will be even harder than the already large hub forming LN that we observe today.\n\n\n> Asking nodes to implement KYC is as impossible as asking miners to only accept KYC transactions.\n\n\nNot really, Large hubs (remember that's where we came in) are likely to be connected to Banks, Amazon.... \n\n\n\n> Also there are protocols that would allow multiple Lightning channels to be opened or modified with a single on-chain transaction (can be implemented via a soft fork).\n\n\nyep batching many channel openings in 1 transaction, but each of those channels still has an onchain footprint of at least 43 bytes (taproot) perhaps a 10 fold increase in density which is excellent so only $6 to open a channel, still out of reach for those who live on $2 a day even the cheap scaling solution to using Bitcoin excludes 700,000 of the poorest people in the World. Go Figure!\n\n\nBut lest we forget you cannot apply the same batching trick to *trustlessy* close many channels at once. the transactions have already been created and swapped just not broadcast so $62 to close your channel. **better choose your channel partner well**\n\n\nThe best you could do to close your channel if both parties are willing and responsive is to **somehow** find other like minded channels that want to close also and aggregate all your signatures but for N channels you would still have 1 signature and N inputs + 2N outputs maybe a ~50% saving (generous) so only $31. \n\n\nAlso pooled UTXO's (channel factories) the cost of opening a channel goes down with the number of participants but the likely hood of a force close incurring an on chain fee **for everybody** goes up with the number of participants, also a good reason to **choose your pooled UTXO partners carefully**.\n\n\n> So yes they absolutely can prevent me from making a transaction but that can only be an accident because they don't know who I am or who I am paying.\n\n \nYou seem to be missing the point and incidentally where we came in. \n\n\nIn your idealised LN world everybody is an equal peer and there is no need to go through centralised hubs - this is not what we see is happening.\n\n\nIf your payment **has** at some point to go through a large **well connected** centralised hub then that hub **can choose** not to route the payment until it has the complete knowledge of from where and to whom the payment goes, how does you hiding behind tor force them to route your payment if they require KYC?\n\n\nPerhaps large non KYC hubs can work, but if everybody is dark how do you find a route?\n\n\nAt the end of the day it's the large on chain fee (by design) that puts a stake through the heart of L2 solutions as far as I can see.\n\n\nGood Luck!",

I am led to believe routing to be a hard problem at scale (when you don't have an accurate global map) through an evenly spaced network (all peers having similar connectivity) especially when roads can be only one way and you don't know until you get to them. It's quite amazing what the LN guys have done so far (I keep meaning to look into the exact heuristics they use). needless to say the difficulty without large nodes (signposts) goes up exponentially with scale, twice the channels is not just twice the difficulty but much more and World scale is probably a 1000x more scaling than today with the added exponential difficulty. (apologies for the dense somewhat rambling text)\n\n\nI believe hubs will be necessary for World scale, but as you know my thing against this scaling is the high on chain fee (by design) that the man in the street won't be able to afford. I cannot see any way round that, hence BCH.",

Unlike other coins it actually [has decentralised management](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/faqs/BCH/how-does-BCH-governance-work), it has SIX full node dev teams instead of just 1 and they recently did some very strong upgrades (plus the SmartBCH teams), it has a huge array of projects.\n\nIt sounds like the price decline is depressing you and that's fine, it is actually best you sell and leave so I support that.  But you should at least be honest with yourself that that is your reasoning, because if you actually believed in the metrics you said then you should absolutely love BCH and I have no idea where you would find a better coin.\n\nIf your use case is trying to speculate in fiat to get rich, which you also say it is, then there is a lot of better options and you will be happier with them definitely.",

It's the internet equivalent of a decentralized gold standard, while BTC is a less decentralized version (due to congestion, it's closer to heavy bullion).\n\nAnother issue is the lack of wide support for **USDT (SLP)**. So lots of us are using TRON or BSC instead (I only use Tron).\n\nIt looks like instead of truly supporting Bitcoin & its forks, most ppl chose to maximize potential profits by supporting something else instead. Hence we're left with over-valued bullion!",
