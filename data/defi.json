The use case is for those that like the idea of single staking their stable coins at a high % without having to convert it to UST or bridge over to Terra. \n\nA thing to note is that the UST deposit % will be dropping slowly in the near future and Orion's rates will therefore be dropping as well. \n\nPersonally, as a staker and holder of Luna for longer than most, I don't really have a positive look on the protocol as they leverage the Anchor APR without allowing it to have it's intended effect(spread UST adoption). They also bribe people to stake with their validator with Orion tokens, which has allowed them to be the largest delegated validator even though they don't provide any benefit to Terra and are essentially leaches. That's just my opinion though.",

So, essentially what is happening with Terra right now is that there\u2019s a large pot of money in Anchor that people deposit into and that others can borrow from by locking up LUNA or ETH.\n\nWhen you do this from the borrow side, you mint bLUNA or bETH which gives you an amount of UST that you can borrow from at an interest rate that\u2019s pretty high (~13% last I checked). You can\u2019t burn your bLUNA or bETH back for LUNA or ETH (unlock it) unless you pay back what you borrowed.\n\nIf you can\u2019t pay back what you borrowed, you\u2019re able to burn your collateral LUNA or ETH (in forms bLUNA or bETH) to pay it back. In crypto terms this is actually a relatively safe way to borrow more than you have in order to see a gain that\u2019s greater because you\u2019re *leveraging* UST to expand your capital base.\n\nThis is further amplified by Mirror Protocol (which allows premium, synthetic shorting) and other Terra-based protocols including Astroport.\n\nIn short: borrow UST on margin to make more money. If you can\u2019t, they take your collateral in the form of LUNA or ETH that\u2019s bonded. This is generally known as leveraging.",

What I mean by this, there is a lot of US government attention that focused on crypto after the Coinbase books had to be opened for their DPO and since it seems that the current administration is going after stable coins (possibly for a CBDC) then they could easily shut down Circle which in turn basically rugs YOU or at best temporarily freezes the assets. \n\nThat's absolute worst case scenario imo. But watching the state of US politics, monetary policies, and the looming regulations due to the governments debt (yeah I think they want our money to pay off their negligence) I wouldn't say USDC is any safer than MIM or UST.

                    "response": "I'm new to this whole thing as well, let's learn together.\n\nMy understanding so far:\n\nIf you borrow crypto against crypto and crypto goes up in value, you won't get liquidated, but to pay back your borrowing it'll be more expensive. Not advised unless your borrowing apy is less than supply apy, usually will only be the case if you're being rewarded the platforms coin for the borrow apy. If the value of the platforms coin goes down in value your borrow APY will be more than supply APY and at some point your outstanding will be more than you have supplied and  then you'll get liquidated. You're kind of locking in the current valuation of your crypto.\n\nIf you borrow crypto using stablecoins, you're kind of shorting the crypto, hoping value of said crypto will go down over time. Because if it goes up in value, you owe more than you borrowed over time and risk of liquidation goes up.\n\nIf you borrow stablecoins using crypto, you're long the crypto. If crypto price goes up, you can borrow more in the future or payback using increased value of crypto giving you a net gain.\n\nIt all comes down to what your end goal is. Francium on Solana Network has some interesting yield farming and delta neutral strategies if you're just looking to gain some yield on your crypto, I believe there are quite a few defi platforms out there that do something similar.\n\nIf you're looking to get some cash against your holdings without losing your original position, the safest bet is to borrow stablecoins against crypto. Your risk is here crypto loses value and you get liquidated. But technically you only lose the gap in your borrowing and liquidation threshold ( usually 20% since max. Borrowing in most platforms is 75 max borrowing and 80 liquidation).\n\nAdd on top of this the fact that you can use leverage by borrowing and supplying back into the same token and then borrowing stablecoins against it, you're in a highly risky territory where you'll have to make spreadsheets and charts to understand at what crypto value do you risk losing it all. We end up being no different to TradFi in 2008 crisis where loans were packaged with more loans and one default crushed the entire economy.\n\nSorry for the word vomit, this is where I've landed in my learnings so far.",

                    "response": "The risk is an equivalent of a bank run where everyone just sells, the Static or Tomb token loses its peg and the deflationary bond mechanic won't work if people choose not to buy back in because they lack faith that the peg will restore. (Because of this, I would classify this as a degen play)\n\nCharge is a lot newer and had an exploit not too long ago, but they've since fixed it and have set up a way to generate charge for victims.\n\nTomb has lasted a lot longer and did have an exploit to the gatekeeper tax mechanic that has since been removed. The exploit led to people selling out of fear (probably) and nobody bought back bonds to restore the peg. They've since been bought over by a VC who is almost the de-facto spokesperson of Tomb Finance whereas Charge DeFi remains pseudonymous.\n\nThe rebase mechanic only generates yield when the stablecoin is above peg, it doesn't generate you yield if it's below. But for the most part, they tend to hold above peg most of the time (which is what u want if u want to farm the rebases). \nYou could also farm the Liquidity pairs which have really good APRs.\n\nThe yield here is real because it's a reallocation of value to stakers (compared to just inflating a token and redistributing to practically everyone which doesn't generate any real yield). The problem is that demand is the driver of pushing the stablecoin above peg, so this only makes money when the demand is sufficiently high. During debt phases, u could always farm the Liquidity pairs for more consistent yield.\n\nWhen u use auto-compounders, u also add the additional platform/smart contract risk.",

Lol. \n\nNow I pay my parents to help me with my business lol. \n\nIf you have real convictions for ETH, then this shouldn't matter bud. \n\nI believe in ETH and have been stacking it since 2016 man. I ALSO bought at near 5k but I always buy regardless of the price because I believe in ETH. \n\nETH isn't like any other crypto atm that I can see. It's a protocol it's not a crypto. We BUILD on ETH. \n\nYOU GOT THIS DUDE, learn from this and keep on growing my dude you GOT THIS\n\nAlso IF and WHEN ETH is POS the price will go up just because of its nature changing. So I mean hopefully he held it lol my friend got into ETH at 3 and sold at 300. He bought a massive farm and he's happy but you KNOW he's kicking himself when he bought back in at 500 instead of holding.

Given the threat of loss of all or a portion of your stake, it is in your best interest to not cheat the network and on the other hand would be extremely cost prohibitive to try to cheat the network\n\nAnother confusing problem you will run into on this sub in particular is that many people conflate \"staking\" which refers to participating in the consensus mechanism of a proof of stake protocol with depositing your crypto tokens into a centralized crypto bank/money market that lends out your crypto to other parties and gives you a percentage of the yield.

                    "response": "My early impression of this gamefi is that trading card and RTS games are the most easy to design or port into this sector. These games really are just Defi platforms with a game UI. The economy centers around purchasing products, staking, and buying/selling in-game assets. Take Splinterlands for example: initial steps to play/generate income require the purchase of an in-game product. From there, the players may play for free to slowly accumulate rewards, or can participate in the game's NFT marketplace to buy or rent better cards to generate better rewards faster via grinding through ranked play.\n\nThe rewards of the games native currency can then be staked or placed into LP's for further rewards. It's a staking, nft market place, and lending platform, built around a trading card game. Gods Unchained has a similar experience, albeit with richer gameplay. \n\nIts these aspects that allow a game to be a functional Defi vector. I can see these games getting exponentially richer and satisfying once AAA developers enter the frey. Further, just like the rest of the crypto sphere, I see early adopters reaping huge benefits for embracing gamefi. \n\nKeeping reading news sources for hints of big developers partnering with networks. I myself am vigilant for the first signs of Wizards of the Coast partnering to develop any of their games for web3.",

For example, the AXS token of the blockchain game Axie Infinity rose by more than 1500% in three months, breaking into the top 50 assets in terms of capitalization and making it into global financial media.\n\nUh, sure, but you're neglecting to mention that \"gaming\" tokens also crashed, including AXS, and in fact did worse since November than Ethereum or other safe bets.\n\nThe problem is, these \"gaming\" tokens have nothing to do with actual games. There's no actual players.\n\nTo be clear, if you're paying someone to do something, it's not a game it's a job, and they're not a player, they're an employee. If you pay people to do something, *obviously* people will do it, but that doesn't make money for your platform, it just creates fake involvement.\n\nA real game has actual players, who are playing the game *for* *fun*, not *for* *money.* And the way a real game makes money is that people are willing to *pay* to play it. Let's get this straight: in a real game, payers pay the game maker, not the other way around.\n\nEvery single game or game platform mentioned in this thread is just minting coins and paying people to do worthless tasks so they can pretend they have high player numbers, but that's just a lie. All these games and game platforms have close to 0 actual players. These platforms are *losing* money, not making it, and the only reason their coins have ever gone up in value is that there are suckers willing to speculate on the coins because they don't understand what's going on.\n\nOf course, there's plenty of potential for a game to start that doesn't do this stupid play-to-earn crap, but so far even the most promising games (even Gods Unchained, sadly) have all fallen into this trap.\n\nTL;DR: These coins are *terrible* investments. If you don't get out while they're up, they'll go down and never come back.",

The use case is for those that like the idea of single staking their stable coins at a high % without having to convert it to UST or bridge over to Terra. \n\nA thing to note is that the UST deposit % will be dropping slowly in the near future and Orion's rates will therefore be dropping as well. \n\nPersonally, as a staker and holder of Luna for longer than most, I don't really have a positive look on the protocol as they leverage the Anchor APR without allowing it to have it's intended effect(spread UST adoption). They also bribe people to stake with their validator with Orion tokens, which has allowed them to be the largest delegated validator even though they don't provide any benefit to Terra and are essentially leaches. That's just my opinion though.",

So, essentially what is happening with Terra right now is that there\u2019s a large pot of money in Anchor that people deposit into and that others can borrow from by locking up LUNA or ETH.\n\nWhen you do this from the borrow side, you mint bLUNA or bETH which gives you an amount of UST that you can borrow from at an interest rate that\u2019s pretty high (~13% last I checked). You can\u2019t burn your bLUNA or bETH back for LUNA or ETH (unlock it) unless you pay back what you borrowed.\n\nIf you can\u2019t pay back what you borrowed, you\u2019re able to burn your collateral LUNA or ETH (in forms bLUNA or bETH) to pay it back. In crypto terms this is actually a relatively safe way to borrow more than you have in order to see a gain that\u2019s greater because you\u2019re *leveraging* UST to expand your capital base.\n\nThis is further amplified by Mirror Protocol (which allows premium, synthetic shorting) and other Terra-based protocols including Astroport.\n\nIn short: borrow UST on margin to make more money. If you can\u2019t, they take your collateral in the form of LUNA or ETH that\u2019s bonded. This is generally known as leveraging.",

                            "response": "The only downside I could see with USDC is that Circle is attempting to be a publicly traded company through the Concord Acquisition SPAC. What I mean by this, there is a lot of US government attention that focused on crypto after the Coinbase books had to be opened for their DPO and since it seems that the current administration is going after stable coins (possibly for a CBDC) then they could easily shut down Circle which in turn basically rugs YOU or at best temporarily freezes the assets. \n\nThat's absolute worst case scenario imo. But watching the state of US politics, monetary policies, and the looming regulations due to the governments debt (yeah I think they want our money to pay off their negligence) I wouldn't say USDC is any safer than MIM or UST. MAI won't survive imo.\n\nBut the remaining on this list are great. BUSD, USDP, TUSD, DAI.",

It isn't despite the markets being so volatile, young people are hanging around, but rather...Young people are hanging around *because* markets are so volatile.\n\nMost of the discussions with my students boil down their understanding (prior to my lessons on cryptocurrencies) that these are gambling instruments that are only interesting beyond the stock market for 3 reasons:\n\n\\- Access to crypto is far easier for minors than access to the stock market is\n\n\\- Because the capital they control is tiny, they need big swings in price to reach their nominal goals (I'd be more than happy with a 10%+ return on investment over the course of a year, but that seems like nothing when you only invest $1000 you got working at Taco Bell after school)\n\n\\- Distrust in \"the system\" is high among a lot of teens and the idea of a trustless system like crypto gives them the illusion of themselves being in control. There is a strong narrative that retail drives cryptocurrency prices (though we know that institutions and the same old money capital of the stock market have their hands deep in this world too), so they feel as though they are able to invest AND buck the system at the same time, which is appealing in a way that the stock market isn't\n\nWould love to hear what other peoples' anecdotal experiences are with actual kids and crypto.",

A high interest rate is directly related to the risk-free asset and increases the cost of capital and risk aversion. Any project, no matter how good, will become more expensive.\n\nI disagree that there will be \"less money available to borrow\". There will be money available yes, but it will cost more. The question is: Is a project good enough to be paid with more expensive funds? There are many out there that really are.\n\n2- I agree with \"soon there won't be enough liquid capital for these xxx% APY\u2019s\". Some platforms will vanish since they are not sustainable, but others will prevail. My bets are (few examples): Circle (over 20B of AUM last time I've seen), SwissBorg (an Unicorn), Yield App (launched a new platform, growing fast with 450M AUM) and Nexo (huge variety of assets).\n\n3- I disagree. FED does not scare me. Jerry (Jerome Powell) needs to do something, right? It's his job. FED is fighting the highest inflation in 40 years. But he has a huge problem called mainly \"USDC\". Issued by Circle, closer to regulatory boards, audited by a Top5 and becoming hugely popular with the total supply surpassing USDT on Ethereum for the first time. This is going to be even tougher to him after DeFi 2.0 that will surely increase digital asset's adoption.\n\n4- It makes two of us for this: \"I have a \u201csafe\u201d job and a \u201csafe\u201d amount of money invested into traditional stocks and ETFs\". I hodl so many ETFs that I can't remember how many, mainly on disruptive technology, AI and ML. ARKF, ARKK, IHF, IXN and many stocks. I go with Buffet for this one: \"Never bet against America\".\n\n5- \"I mainly use crypto as a high interest savings account\". I have no idea what you are talking about, man. The words \"high interest\" and \"savings\" just blew my mind out :)\n\nI like your strategy with NEAR protocol, but I didn't have enough time to make a deep research on it. Maybe you could diversify more. Exactly because of this that I'm using multiple platforms (Swiss, Circle, Yield...)  and the highest APY I have comes from USDC on Yield (18% + 12% on locked YLD). I have a double-digit inflation where I live and staking is the only way.\n\nLet's hodl our ETFs, stocks and crypto strong and keep enjoying those APYs.",

Everything about a coin can be great, and something unforseeable can come along and cause the coin to fail.

The best analysts know they're fallible and diversify, and so should you.\n\n>Ref will grow linearly with NEAR and automatically diversity across and entire L1.\n\nREF *will not* grow linearly with NEAR. Look at [these tokenomics](https://guide.ref.finance/tokenomics). You're looking at 50% dilution over the next 4 years. And if NEAR grows, other DEXs will launch on NEAR, which will split the subeconomy.\n\nAnd REF won't diversify across the entire L1. The REF coin staking is a bet on *trading volume*, not on *price,* and it's quite possible for coins in the ecosystem to go up in price without a lot of trading volume. If anything, a downward market causes more trading volume than an upward market: look at the graph on the right side of [this page](https://info.uniswap.org/) and you'll see more volume the last few days due to panic trading than in any previous weeks.\n\nMake no mistake, you're not diversified. You're in two coins (NEAR and REF) staked in two pools that depend on transaction and trading volume on one chain.\n\nI am not sure I'd even invest in this strategy *at all*, let alone put my entire crypto bags in it. It's not an insane strategy as part of a diversified portfolio, but I don't like those REF tokenomics.

The smart contract code will exist forever (it cannot be destroyed). The only way for LP tokens to move out of the pool is for liquidity providers to withdraw them.\n\nNot all protocols function like that. Sushiswap LP pools work exactly as described above, however their farming contracts have a \"migrate\" function that an admin cal call. This allows the admin to move all LP deposited in the farming contract to a different address. People accept this risk as they trust that Sushiswap is not going to steal their tokens, however Sushiswap can steal user tokens deposited in their farming contract if they choose to do so.\n\nThat's why security audits exist - if you read an audit it will tell you all the (known) risks associated with admin controls. Audits are not perfect and they often miss fatal bugs, but they're still useful.\n\nHere are some high level checks you must perform to make sure that a protocol can't disappear with your tokens:\n\n* Is the code audited (they may have an audit of a previous version, that doesn't mean that the new version is safe)\n* Is the smart contract on chain verified, and does it 100% match the audited code\n* When using the protocol do you interact with the smart contract directly, or with a proxy? If it's a proxy can the proxy implementation be changed? If yes the proxy admin can take all user funds.",

With DeFi you should at least be able to follow through the maths in a whitepaper and check onchain activity to determine where the value is coming from. This lets you know if assets are being loaned out, or if an inflationary token is being used to support it or whatever. You've at least got a chance to tell if a protocol is sustainable or not.\n\nWith a centralized platform like an exchange you've basically got no way to know other than what they decide to tell you. CdC are probably not doing anything particularly scammy, but the fact that you can't verify that and just have to trust them should feel a bit outdated compared to using DeFi platforms.\n\nIf you keep considering questions like this before using platforms then I think you're likely to avoid some of the tempting traps that naive investors fall for in crypto.",

There is no location that can burn down, no company going out of business, which would stop you accessing your funds. The two risks are exploits of the smart contract (such as flashloan attacks) and your carelessness. The former become less likely the longer a project has been running, as presumably possible hacks and exploit vectors would probably have been found after years of operation and huge numbers of users. \n\n\nIf you stick to big, well used platforms (like Curve, AAVE etc) then your actions represent almost your entire source of risk. Signing transactions you haven't checked, losing your private keys/seed phrase, using fake links, having your PC compromised, being fished, all of these are risks.

Use historical eth/btc ratios to throw in the calculator to gauge how much IL you might encounter. Is LPing worth it? Depends on the time horizon and LP APR (rewards+fees). If you can get 20%+ on eth/btc, it's probably worth it.\n2. You can LP eth/btc other places or just lend eth and btc individually so no IL. DM if you want suggestions for fantom/avax/ethereum defi apps to throw it in (note I won't shill scams or small garbage projects, only trustable big names with $100M+ liquidity).\n3. I don't know algorand but I wonder how the native eth and btc is custodied. Note that many bridges have been hacked/exploited lately leading to $1B+ in losses...something to consider. Also this goBTC/ETH, make sure you understand the risks and liquidity for that. You may try to make 25% but those coins de-peg and you lose 5-20% immediately, something to consider.\n4. Another option to consider is throwing it in aave/compound and their forks and borrowing stables against them to farm with. You would only want to borrow like 50-60% LTV so not as efficient and needs maintenance/watching to prevent liquidation, but no IL.\n5. Personally not a fan of CeFi apps, they are probably fine but I'm sure some are degens and lose user funds at some point.\n\nHere's another point..\n\nIf you're scared of IL, you can hedge it to reduce downside risk. Simply re-balance your tokens after a certain threshold, let's say after a 20% change in the pair price. So if you start with 1 btc and 1 eth (just making these numbers up) and then through IL you have 1.2 btc and 0.5eth, sell some btc to eth to get back to 1:1.  If the ratio returns to where you entered, you end up losing here though but if pair keeps diverging then you hedged the downside. There is no silver bullet, you can hedge as often as you want and mitigate downside risk while likely eating away at your yield.",

The borrow APR is 0%, but there is a repayment fee of 0.5%, which is amazing if you plan to keep it there for a while. You can only borrow their own stablecoin called MAI though, but it seems to be pretty well used on many different DEXs. You can also convert the MAI to any other coin (stable or otherwise) to farm or stake to your own liking.\n\nAnother benefit is that they incentivise borrowing by paying a certain percentage APR relative to your loan. So if you deposit say $1000 worth of wBTC and borrow $500 worth of MAI (collateral ratio ~50%) you will earn around 12% per annum in Qi (the platform's own token) paid out every week. These percentages change based on votes by the DAO, so some weeks I earn a lot less Qi because the DAO chose to incentivise borrowing against other coins than my own.\n\nThe platform is much smaller than Aave and probably has a higher chance of hacks or exploits, but to me the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nNot financial advice btw!",

OP conveniently forgets the events of black thursday or w/e it was called when $DAI collapsed and needed to be bailed out via emergency $MAKER auction\n\nDAI was pretty young at that time, and they were able to get it to recover pretty quickly. I remember seeing my UST holdings last March iirc go down to $0.94 and some hedge fund or something bailing UST out. Both DAI and UST have added additional mechanisms to bolster their pegs since both of their run on the pegs. DAI is definitely a lot more battle tested than UST though.\n\n>$DAI is a wrapper for $USDC now, the project completely lost its trajectory and original mission - it's not even pretending to be decentralized anymore\n\nAround 60% according to your image linked above. I agree that it is too much, but it also isn't all that it is.\n\n> it cannot scale, much like many collateralized assets\n\nIn what respect can't it scale? Its market capitalization scaling, or tps?",

The only outgoing transactions (per-approval) that were made were to:\n\n* RenBridge (RenVM), for renBTC (mint + approval);\n* Paraswap v5: Augustus Swapper Mainnet, to exchange renBTC for wBTC;\n* Wrapped BTC (wBTC) contract approval;\n* zkSync wBTC deposit;\n\nThe last outgoing transaction was made \\~2 days ago from OP's address to [a Laundering Intermediary Address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb4942daa4af61eedf014e4955d697e070cdf7b7a) (LIA), or an address that was made for the specific purpose of diverting stolen funds through contracts while remaining pseudonymous and 'relatively unsuspect' (due to 'low balances' and 'few transactions').\n\nThe LIA withdrew the Ether in the quantity of \u039e0.061159733395561 ($208.10) and swapped the balance for Wrapped Ether (wETH) via UniSwap V3 and the MetaMask Swap Router, after approving the Curve Token Contract to 'wash' the tokens (which is all traceable, so ????)\n\nThe LIA sent a value of \u039e0.043 ($142.47) to another LIA (we'll denote it as LIA-2). The LIA-2 address is viewable [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xeba6726793e1356e7040bb544ec1d911191717a2).\n\n**The LIA-2 sent the funds to a potential** [**Laundering Hub Address**](https://etherscan.io/address/0x077d360f11d220e4d5d831430c81c26c9be7c4a4) **(LHA)**. The LHA has a nominal value of \\~$110.65k at-time-of-writing in ETH and an additional $5.59k in various tokens including, but not limited to, Tether USD, Chainlink, Wrapped Bitcoin, Ankr, USDC, and random non-value coins.\n\nThe LHA is where OP has tracked the money to. From here, anybody willing to investigate into this potential LHA should look at one or both of the following:\n\n* [Incoming Transaction Log](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x077d360f11d220e4d5d831430c81c26c9be7c4a4&f=3) \\- to view if funds were stolen from other addresses\n* [Outgoing Transaction Log](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x077d360f11d220e4d5d831430c81c26c9be7c4a4&f=2) \\- to view where the laundered funds are sent to\n\nYou will see the potential LHA has 2,000 pages of outgoings here. By sampling from the first ten pages, you can find several unique addresses and contracts that may be of use when investigating these types of fund thefts.\n\n* ENS addresses - [fooled.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b8de1551a96c67e5ba5eaafc41fbc8d87484e95), [bendreary.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3a2548af0f22204eec8da7b2d002f0b01f9cdab8), [4mradik.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb72a7e658a8a9a63e8b89b9bde8177a427aa6342), [astalil.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0ef955288ab7fe8e490800ad49858dbdb7c1e275), [ixpartay.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a3e14702ae60c8b7fc5957990518233ff752634), [ethereumte.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7462fd2fadb7f2850ce1a960e672adfb3e29877f), [buford.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x92fe601f2e42f80ec784a7e76b22201504d108bb)\n   * One common trend includes funneling money through OpenSea's Wyvern Exchange.\n* Various Non-ID'd Contract addresses - [Contract A](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd41d0a45672ee52656ebc191a26ae3088225e2c4), [Contract B](https://etherscan.io/address/0x763ec4e70882555c6f1bc1a5e769dc31d5fddfc3), [Contract C](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcbafde962280277e8cbd703aa42abf7eec2c2e42), [Contract D](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7bd6dc4266dc4ce74b6bb0e982ae4e006d17105d), [Contract E](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0a1820f0ff7dc9fce0a4f0b589ee14ddae88233c)\n   * Contract A sends money through Gemini Exchange contracts which doesn't allow viewability of private addresses.\n   * Contract B sends money to a non-ID contract which creates Forwarder addresses.\n      * A Forwarder address, in simple terms, means that whenever Ethereum is sent to the contract, it will send money via the Forwarder Contract to addresses outlined in the contract.\n      * The creator of this contract is [this address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbf0c5d82748ed81b5794e59055725579911e3e4e) which owns \\~$4.2m in ETH and >105 tokens (mostly Dai, Chainlink, UniSwap, USDT, USDC, Wirex Token, 1INCH, wBTC, and way more).\n      * The contract uses a functionality called Flush Forwarder Tokens which removes the ERC-20 tokens in a Forwarder contract. Basically, they're cashing out (mostly in Dai).\n   * Contract C is a non-ID contract that sends money over to Loopring.\n      * Decompiling the Contract Byte code was actually the first request of this. You can view the decompiled contract here by selecting \"[Decompile Bytecode](https://etherscan.io/bytecode-decompiler?a=0xcbafde962280277e8cbd703aa42abf7eec2c2e42).\"\n      * There are 21,796 EXACT matches of Bytecode with this specific Contract [viewable here](https://etherscan.io/find-similar-contracts?a=0xcbafde962280277e8cbd703aa42abf7eec2c2e42&lvl=5).\n      * The contract is actually very short and only uses storage + \\_fallback() payable functions.\n   * Contract D sends money to Contract B.\n      * Contract D also has not been decompiled before. [Viewable here](https://etherscan.io/bytecode-decompiler?a=0x7bd6dc4266dc4ce74b6bb0e982ae4e006d17105d).\n      * There is a larger subsample of Exact-Match Bytecode ([1,536,686 contracts](https://etherscan.io/find-similar-contracts?a=0x7bd6dc4266dc4ce74b6bb0e982ae4e006d17105d&lvl=5)).\n      * This contract calls to a parentAddress (which uses storage 0 reference) and then flushes the tokens with a \\_fallback() payable.\n   * Contract E has a different address creator, which was an interesting find as an address related to Contract B - [here's the address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x604df452158e7ddf3e44338308edc079a953c9da).\n      * The address routinely sends money to Forwarder Factories and the Contract B address using flushForwarderTokens() and creates Forwarder Contracts with 0 wei code viewable on the contract.\n      * Given its high amount of Ethereum relative to other tokens, it's possible this is the equivalent of a truck designed to move money from A (sending address) to C (contract address) acting as point B (gas middleman).\n      * [This contract is actually quite long](https://etherscan.io/bytecode-decompiler?a=0x0a1820f0ff7dc9fce0a4f0b589ee14ddae88233c). It's important to note that it still uses the same safeMode() and \\_fallback() payable functions.",

It could happen that at the time your request has finally been processed and executed, you\u2019ve lost money because the market, as always, can change in just a matter of seconds.\r  \n\r  \nThere are apps that can help you with that. In my case, I use SupraFin, which is available for Android and iOS. The app lets you know which coins you should buy by evaluating your profile and reading the market along with the latest movements in prices and pools. It\u2019s very convenient. However, you\u2019ll have to look them up and see whether they are what you were looking for. Don\u2019t buy at first sight and do some research. The token or coin might be what you wanted, but also might contain vague projects, a shady schedule, and a basic code that only stands out for its simplicity.\r  \n\r  \nYou need to take into consideration many details before picking a new project.",

                    "response": "IL occurs when volatility happens between asset A and B and you are in an LP pair A-B. The greater the relative volatility, the greater the IL.\n\nPairing two coins is the general move here if you are pairing two volatile assets. The best way to assess this is to take the price delta of A and price delta of B and see how much they deviate (\u03c3) over a given time period. The number you receive as a ratio >1 or <1 is a general indicator of how great of an IL you may suffer - or *not* realize.\n\nWhile the strategy to pair positively-correlated A-B is generally correct, you still experience IL if the *price deltas of A and B are not the same*. This is a challenging behavior to work with if you're \"pool diving\" since two assets can both rise, but if one experiences a greater increase in %-price-change, you experience IL nonetheless.\n\nTL;DR? Make sure if you pair A-B that their changes-in-price (price \u25b2) is net zero %.\n\nExample:\n\n* In a BTC-ETH pool (hypothetically), the deposit value is 1:1 at values $40,000 and $4,000.\n* If both prices double to $80,000:$8,000, you experience no IL.\n* If BTC hits $65,000 and Ethereum hits $4,500, you experience IL - because the percentage increase of BTC was 61.5% (of $40,000) and the percentage increase of ETH was only 12.5%.\n\nWhile the changes in price are, percentage-wise, large, the IL experienced is \\`-1.67%.\n\nThis is also why delta-neutral strategies are hot hot hot right now. Take X amount of positively correlated assets and LP them. Earn fees while minimizing or neutralizing downside risk. (Then it's basically not delta neutral anymore, in totality, but I digress as it's late here.)\n\nUse this calculator for toying around with IL values: [https://whiteboardcrypto.com/impermanent-loss-calculator/](https://whiteboardcrypto.com/impermanent-loss-calculator/)",

So, essentially what is happening with Terra right now is that there\u2019s a large pot of money in Anchor that people deposit into and that others can borrow from by locking up LUNA or ETH.\n\nWhen you do this from the borrow side, you mint bLUNA or bETH which gives you an amount of UST that you can borrow from at an interest rate that\u2019s pretty high (~13% last I checked). You can\u2019t burn your bLUNA or bETH back for LUNA or ETH (unlock it) unless you pay back what you borrowed.\n\nIf you can\u2019t pay back what you borrowed, you\u2019re able to burn your collateral LUNA or ETH (in forms bLUNA or bETH) to pay it back. In crypto terms this is actually a relatively safe way to borrow more than you have in order to see a gain that\u2019s greater because you\u2019re *leveraging* UST to expand your capital base.\n\nThis is further amplified by Mirror Protocol (which allows premium, synthetic shorting) and other Terra-based protocols including Astroport.\n\nIn short: borrow UST on margin to make more money. If you can\u2019t, they take your collateral in the form of LUNA or ETH that\u2019s bonded. This is generally known as leveraging.",

The GOV might mandate censorship, USDC and USDT are on centralized smart contracts and they can freeze adresses. DAI is built on top of theses two so if they assets are frozen DAI becomes undercollateralized. MIM dosen't have an interest rate and is subjected to possible bank runs & depeg.\n\n\\- Inflation is high, likely 20%+. The yield will likely only cover inflation.",

When luna hit $90 it means a ton of people traded their UST for your Luna in your liquidity pool, so you end up with more UST and less Luna. But because the price of LUNA went up and UST remained stable, you still make a gain ($360 vs $250), the gain just isn't as big as if you had held your LUNA and UST instead.\n\nConversely, if Luna dipped to $25 when you broke your LP position, you would end up with a lot more Luna and less UST, as your LP position will DCA buy more Luna as the price drops.\n\nWhen people say stablecoin pairs are safe they mean stablecoin + stablecoin LP, eg UST/USDC, USDT/DAI, etc. Typically you wouldn't get more than 15-20% apr on those pairs.\n\nImpermanent loss is minimised where you pick two tokens that correlate in price action (eg ATOM/OSMO). Here you picked one volatile token and one token that is fixed at $1, so the risk of impermanent loss is quite high.",
