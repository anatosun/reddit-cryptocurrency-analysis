They stake Eth through Lido and get stETH in return which they deposit into Aave and borrow more ETH and restake it into Lido until they achieve the targeted rate. The automated protocol seems pretty secure with relatively low risk. For further yield you can deposit the icETH into a G-UNI LP on uniswap v3 which has an automated balancing protocol and since icETH is pegged to ETH in the LP, you have minimal risk of impermanence loss and low slippage.",

The use case is for those that like the idea of single staking their stable coins at a high % without having to convert it to UST or bridge over to Terra. \n\nA thing to note is that the UST deposit % will be dropping slowly in the near future and Orion's rates will therefore be dropping as well. \n\nPersonally, as a staker and holder of Luna for longer than most, I don't really have a positive look on the protocol as they leverage the Anchor APR without allowing it to have it's intended effect(spread UST adoption). They also bribe people to stake with their validator with Orion tokens, which has allowed them to be the largest delegated validator even though they don't provide any benefit to Terra and are essentially leaches. That's just my opinion though.",

Maybe it\u2019s actually harder to keep a big coin stable because you need more money to do it. I\u2019m not saying this is the case, but being big is not directly linked with being safe.",

Large liquidity outside the terra ecosystem as well as nearly half of Luna locked in staking for 21 days is what will absorb the initial impact.  After that, arbitrageurs will come in to play when the price action slows down.  Continuous exit pressure from the terra ecosystem is less likely as UST expands further outside its own ecosystem.  Btc reserves are not yet fully implemented but getting that in place will provide another cushion for the fall.

I\u2019ve been paranoid and I\u2019ve been wrong, and I\u2019d rather be paranoid! \ud83d\ude1c\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not criticizing your choice of linear price appreciation, as it\u2019s better than no data at all as you suggest. I\u2019m quite impressed with your analysis as a whole and the nice thing is that you can modify the model as you see fit to assess the impact on results.\n\nRegarding the halvings, I have considered how to represent this before and I\u2019m just not sure. It almost always leads me to something that looks logarithmic though.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve come to is that there are competing effects\u2026namely the reduction in block reward driving scarcity of supply pitted against (assumed) ever-increasing institutional adoption. I think as the former progresses, it will drive demand up especially in light of the significant amount of institutional accumulation that has and will continue to happen. That said, with that accumulation, we could see a reduction in volatility due to the broader/mainstream market recognizing a more stable valuation versus fiat as compared to today\u2019s sentiment that crypto is still largely a speculative asset.\n\nI could go on and on, but I still don\u2019t think I know enough to know (nor does anyone, right?), so testing various approaches in your model may have the effect of bounding the cases in the very least and I believe that is still a valuable message to convey.\n\nLooking forward to your future work!",

                    "response": ">Has anyone succeeded long-term with \"Buy Low, Sell High\" (selling major All-Time-High points and rebuying the dips)? If so, with what part of your portfolio you do it (10-30-100%?).\n\nA common allocation to trading (whether short- or long-term) is generally 10% of the net value of your portfolio. In my fund, I use a flat amount. You can make money with any amount trading but you will see exponential returns with higher base capital amounts, naturally.\n\nLearning trading via market-making isn't cut-and-dry. Buy low and sell high requires the equivalence of securities analysis to do consistently - and consistency is reliant on your methodology. To answer your question, I have had more than several trades that have returned 2x+ and others that return less and some that are losses. Trading is a different discussion.\n\nI disagree with the other user about consistently profiting off trading. You have to do it a lot and be prepared to risk a lot of capital and understand that in long-form you're not profiting as much as if you would have held as-an-investment. The purpose of trading is to market-make for profit.\n\n>If you side with the \"HODL/Staking\" strategy, what are your arguments against \"leaving all that money\" on the table? If so, please elaborate (with personal experiences/math) beyond simply \"it's less risky\".\n\nYour example doesn't account for rate changes, for one. Secondly, most interest rates are calculated on the quantity of tokens owned and not the dollar value associated with it. For example, if you are lending Bitcoin at 18%, but you only have 1 Bitcoin, you're earning 18% on the quantity of 1 and not $45,000. It's only marginally better than keeping it liquid. I don't really need to tell you the math on this one.\n\nHowever, keeping the asset liquid is beneficial if you want to set a limit order *or* keep it ready to buy for opportunities. I can't tell you the amount of times I saw an opportunity to buy something and had to wait days for my lend-for-yield unlock. It's awful, and I often would miss the price buy-in.\n\nAll of this really depends on your temperament. I enjoy being active with my trades and investments, in a way, tinkering and refining the process. Not everyone likes this. (Contrary to your belief, you don't always have to tune into news or chart-watch or draw TA lines - in fact, I avoid nearly all of those and only use a few indicators to make a decent profit - it isn't the highest yield, but certainly a learning process.)\n\nConsider that you could, fundamentally speaking, earn a near-equivalent yield with two different strategies. You could do both but this requires more work and more capital...which is the point.\n\nAnyways, let me touch on your strategies briefly:\n\n>HODL with DeFi Interest/Staking\n\nAssuming you're diversifying strategies across holding (as-liquid) / LP-farms / staking-for-in-kind-interests:\n\n* Liquid capital doesn't earn but allows for opportunistic buys on-demand. If you have price targets you can lend for variable time-periods.\n* LP-farms with volatile assets subjects your portfolio to a degree of impermanent loss unless you develop a sophisticated near-delta-neutral strategy.\n* LP-farms yield consistent fees on certain protocols with high volumes and rates are variable.\n* Staking offsets dilution-of-assets related to inflationary protocols. For non-inflationary assets (e.g. Bitcoin), again, lending on the quantity of the asset needs to be mathematically weighted against lending against the dollar value of the asset. (e.g. what's more profitable - lending 1 BTC at 6% or 3 ETH at 6%?)\n\n>\"Buy Low, Sell High\"\n\nAssuming you're using multiple trading horizons from <1 year (short-term) to >1 year (long-term):\n\n* Even a decent strategy for short-term trading will outweigh fees - these ones are lower-risk. The best strategies are higher-risk and in both cases, risking a greater amount of capital yields more income.\n   * I recommend tracking profits based on principal capital, price of cost basis per-share, and theoretical gains per-share per-bps (basis point). There's actually some sweet spots for this - try running simulations on assets that are $0.10 vs. $1.00 for your base capital and then applying the volatility simulation (bps).\n   * Trading *takes practice*. I don't like the sentiment that trading isn't viable (especially without algobots) that proliferates on crypto subreddits. You have to be willing to put down $1k and watch it drop to $850 in a flash, maybe even $0. Yes, it sucks. Go again. Most people don't stick it out to this point and either quit or settle for algobots.\n* Another pro of trading *in tandem with investing* is that you can generate more capital because you are doing more work (by market-making). You can therefore create a more robust portfolio this way.\n* A recession is the *best* opportunity to repurchase into the market and effectively buttress it. That is why you have liquidity on-hand even if \"it doesn't make anything.\"\n   * This also applies to your comments about inflation. Over sustained periods of time, yes, your cash is going to lose purchasing value, but it's a complex topic; is the increase of goods and services you purchase affecting your cashflow? To give you an example - Warren Buffett is notoriously very minimalistic in lifestyle (as are many other wealthy individuals). If \"losing purchasing power\" means \"cannot go out to eat every weekend\" then it may be, personally, for you, for the better.\n* The USDT risk is nonsense, personally, and if you're that worried about USDT go drop your money in Anchor and call it a day. Don't like that? USDC is reputable, and so is Dai.",

Similarly i also staked DAFI in dump.\n\nBTW this works for me as i only go with my long term choices so i have more conviction to hold \n\nNow i will sell my rewards or take out intials and ride with the profits",

Since you are mostly a BTC staker, I reckon, then stable coins with promising rises in the future are best suited for you. Stable coins\u2019 APY is pretty nice, especially if you have a lot saved up, but they don\u2019t keep up with physical currencies\u2019 inflation. Also, platforms that offer high APYs also contain high gas fees. In my experience, you don\u2019t lose money, but your gains are almost unnoticeable. I\u2019d say ONE Harmony is a better pick for you. NEAR protocol too.\r  \n\r  \nSince you don\u2019t seem acquainted with most tokens, try using an intelligent portfolio app, like [SupraFin](http://suprafin.io) , that evaluates what\u2019s coins you should buy. It uses your portfolio as a basis and works with factual data. Why? Beliefs and cryptos are always entwined together. Despite the fact I have facts to support why ONE should be your 2nd project, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m right about it. On the other hand, a portfolio uses facts to report your investment history, so it becomes a safer choice.\r  \n\r  \nThat doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t listen to advice. In fact, ask as much as you can, but take everything with a pinch of salt.",

So, essentially what is happening with Terra right now is that there\u2019s a large pot of money in Anchor that people deposit into and that others can borrow from by locking up LUNA or ETH.\n\nWhen you do this from the borrow side, you mint bLUNA or bETH which gives you an amount of UST that you can borrow from at an interest rate that\u2019s pretty high (~13% last I checked). You can\u2019t burn your bLUNA or bETH back for LUNA or ETH (unlock it) unless you pay back what you borrowed.\n\nIf you can\u2019t pay back what you borrowed, you\u2019re able to burn your collateral LUNA or ETH (in forms bLUNA or bETH) to pay it back. In crypto terms this is actually a relatively safe way to borrow more than you have in order to see a gain that\u2019s greater because you\u2019re *leveraging* UST to expand your capital base.\n\nThis is further amplified by Mirror Protocol (which allows premium, synthetic shorting) and other Terra-based protocols including Astroport.\n\nIn short: borrow UST on margin to make more money. If you can\u2019t, they take your collateral in the form of LUNA or ETH that\u2019s bonded. This is generally known as leveraging.",

But watching the state of US politics, monetary policies, and the looming regulations due to the governments debt (yeah I think they want our money to pay off their negligence) I wouldn't say USDC is any safer than MIM or UST.

Although I'm not denying the possibility, there are reasons to use it. First of all, there are pairs on CEXs mostly that only have USDT. Second, sometimes you get better rates converting to USDT.  Thirdly, it's used by giant market makers like Alameda and Cumberland despite being shady. I guess they know something that put them at ease using Tether?! Lastly, there are no perfect stables at the moment. **NONE** of them has been audited. There have been only attestation reports which Tether has one too.\n\nPersonally, I'd stay away from anything centralized so it doesn't freeze my crypto whenever it feels like it or government tells it to.",

None of these have any way of blocking assets of users (ie. blacklisting the tokens at a certain address from being moved), which is extremelly important imho.

Fundamentally bitcoin doesn't want or have support the turing complete smart contracts that are common (EVM style) to all the other \"defi\" chains.

I'm happy it's not reliant on some third party \"oracle\" which can be tricked, or a contract written by an average developer.  There are many eyes on bitcoin code, other chains... Not so much, things sneak in (deliberately or not), exploits get... exploited.\n\nSmart contracts on bitcoin, with all the scams and rugs you see elsewhere?  No thanks.  Bitcoin doesn't need an APR or inflation rate to be useful. You can do enough stupid shit with it, without adding more, such as interacting with some smart contract you've never read.\n\nIf you're not comfortable with putting your bitcoin on that CeFi provider or exchange, you don't use them, simple.  Bitcoin is immune to many of the \"crypto\" \"hacks\" that happen, you can get a hard wallet, and sleep safe, can you *really* do that with anything in DeFi?\n\nI don't want my life savings in a browser extension, although I'm happy to use it for day to day stuff, bitcoin is, quite frankly boring, it just sits there, but like a savings account, I'm happy I have it, and I'm happy it's boring.",

Buy only 1 to 4 nodes to begin with. Higher earnings if your vpnd is below 4,999. \nThen autocompound on day 7. \nYou'll get both the autocompounding and diamond hands level 2 bonuses, increasing your daily earnings quite a bit per day. \n\nThis is why vapornodes is the best for stable passive income. Cheapest nodes, good strategies to increase earnings from a small investment, and they've proven they will have a longer sustainable shelf life. \n\nEven buying 1 node, with the strategy above, you can earn up to $10 per day. Not bad for a $60 investment. By day 7, you'll already have earned most of your initial investment back. With Diamondhands and Autocomp, you increase your profit and will have your initial investment back by day 8 or 9. Continue to follow this strategy and do this every 7 to 14 days on each node. Every day you earn more passive income, which is now 100% profit after day 8. Use the same strategy on all 4 nodes and don't combine them until you understand how much it'll decrease your daily profit compared to keeping them separate bc lower tiers make more.\n\nIt's been a good stable investment for me. Here's my referral link if you'd like to try. Don't feel you have to use my referral code / link. I'm not trying to shill it. \n\nhttps://app.vapornodes.finance/nodes?invite=0x0a763B204ce0638Eb80860a96221D5766D96926D\n\nI've been helping many ppl understand defi and how to make real money with different protocols on this channel and other socials, as I've been in Crypto and defi for many years, with lessons learned. \n\nHope this helps!",

Therefore the only possible collateral is DeFi property, like bETH and bLUNA. It just so happens that Anchor chose bETH and bLUNA because they're not only valuable, but they actually yield $UST. So by keeping them locked up, they only only back the loans, they also drop UST into Anchor's wallet. So Anchor gives that earned amount out by managing minting and burning of another token, aUST, that's managed in a way that allows UST accounts to gain value at about 19% per year.\n\nThis was all actually done partially in order to design a compelling DeFi system that would make a case for DeFi people using Terra (it was mainly intended for CeFi use due to its ability to mint multiple stablecoins), and it's indeed attracted a lot of attention to the blockchain, since high adoption of its stablecoin drives up the value of Luna due to the minting mechanism, and high value of Luna in turn makes it easier for the stablecoin to keep its peg, as well as making validation/staking more profitable.\n\nThere are other creative uses of yield-bearing assets. As I've mentioned, aUST is used internally by Anchor to make its accounts earn 20% without needing any deposits (the increases simply appear as UST locked in the account and can be withdrawn at any time by burning aUST). Stader made a similar coin, LunaX, that represents having made a Luna stake; the value of the LunaX token is supposed to increase over time to represent the gain from the staking. The Nexus project has tried to raise funds using a new kind of token that automatically produces $PSI coins, which in turn you should sell as fast as you can because they lose value constantly (that wasn't intended, but it's reality, NEVER hold PSI tokens); Spectrum Finance set up an autocompounder which last I checked is the only single-asset autocompounder for anything aside from staking rewards, so that's kind of cool.

You can lock CRV for four years (haven't done this, personally), receive veCRV, and collect a percentage of trading fees the platform collects in USDC. It's described as being \"like a dividend\" (-ma boomer Dad).\n\nMAI finance - borrow against your collateral at 0%, pay back 0.5% more later ($5 on a $1000 loan). Indefinite tem loans. On polygon, they payout weekly in QI token, on the amount of MAI you've borrowed, at a rate that differs based on your collateral type. On other chains (polygon included), you can borrow against receipt tokens from deposits you've made on other protocols (like Aave, where you're earning a yield), and use that as the collateral you borrow against. Your collateral goes up in value as it earns yield on the first protocol, and you can sell it, to pay back your loan, or borrow more against it. Ideally, you do all of this without getting liquidated. It's a game. It's fun.\n\nAvalaunch (XAVA token) - I don't really know what it does yet, but it sounds cool. I might participate. I'm waving my hands here, but I think it allows me to act as a baby VC. I help new projects on Avalanche raise funds, and I receive their tokens at a deep discount (like a presale), when they launch. Projects are vetted by the Avalaunch team. I believe I do this by simply holding the XAVA token. I might be wrong here.\n\nKeep searching. Seek the wisdom of \"CT\"!

I did this with Taiki Maeda. He's autistic, whether he knows it or not. I like him. CalculatorGuy is also great. Avoid TikTok. I dunno about Instagram. FTMalerts has a great YouTube channel, and he'll respond to DMs on Twitter. I like him also. Regarding the Terra ecosystem, dank_ru uploads really good vids, with really good explanations, regularly. Check him out. Discord, Twitter, and Telegram are your new favorite apps.\n\nYou're gonna be the best grandad ever, when you leave the grandkids a bunch of tokens. I'm glad you made it this far.

It's just a matter of time when people will realize that crypto and DeFi have more power to make them good returns in a safe manner without the high risks involved.\n\nYou already mentioned CRO, NEXO, YLD... Those are perfect examples of how easy and fruitful staking can be. Card payment options and fiat on/off ramps will make things even easier. I moved away from the banks a while ago and tried to avoid them whenever I could. So far, so good I would say. \n\nStablecoin yields on YieldApp are good and maybe they will add more assets when they launch v2. Gonna move some stables to Crypto.com as well, just to diversify a bit and will continue using Freeway for some other assets that are not available on the other ones.",

Taking Sol as an example: Solana is currently averaging 5x bitcoin+ethereums max tps. Like so are many other chains do. So thats no option. Do you go by market cap? Then you're always underperform the market; as investors make money by buying before the rise and selling before the drop.\n\nPersonally I highly recommend a diversified (30+) portfolio with getting in early at every project in your portfolio. However, it saves a lot of mental energy to just limit oneselves attention to those projects that have already 'won' (btc and eth). And that's a valid strategy too. However, I've never touched btc with a 9 foot pole and never will. \n\nThe fact is; there will be no clear winner. Just like no set of servers of datacenters has won the internet. It's infrastructure, they'll be interoperable and interconnected and the BTC infrastructure is in no way going to be able to keep up. BTC won't go away though, it'll just be wrapped and transacted on the other chains because those infrastructures won't be broken or stuck in 2011. \n\nI'm mostly curious how trustless wrapping of BTC is going to be achieved, or whether that will be the actual BTC killer.",

                    "response": "I'm new to this whole thing as well, let's learn together.\n\nMy understanding so far:\n\nIf you borrow crypto against crypto and crypto goes up in value, you won't get liquidated, but to pay back your borrowing it'll be more expensive. Not advised unless your borrowing apy is less than supply apy, usually will only be the case if you're being rewarded the platforms coin for the borrow apy. If the value of the platforms coin goes down in value your borrow APY will be more than supply APY and at some point your outstanding will be more than you have supplied and  then you'll get liquidated. You're kind of locking in the current valuation of your crypto.\n\nIf you borrow crypto using stablecoins, you're kind of shorting the crypto, hoping value of said crypto will go down over time. Because if it goes up in value, you owe more than you borrowed over time and risk of liquidation goes up.\n\nIf you borrow stablecoins using crypto, you're long the crypto. If crypto price goes up, you can borrow more in the future or payback using increased value of crypto giving you a net gain.\n\nIt all comes down to what your end goal is. Francium on Solana Network has some interesting yield farming and delta neutral strategies if you're just looking to gain some yield on your crypto, I believe there are quite a few defi platforms out there that do something similar.\n\nIf you're looking to get some cash against your holdings without losing your original position, the safest bet is to borrow stablecoins against crypto. Your risk is here crypto loses value and you get liquidated. But technically you only lose the gap in your borrowing and liquidation threshold ( usually 20% since max. Borrowing in most platforms is 75 max borrowing and 80 liquidation).\n\nAdd on top of this the fact that you can use leverage by borrowing and supplying back into the same token and then borrowing stablecoins against it, you're in a highly risky territory where you'll have to make spreadsheets and charts to understand at what crypto value do you risk losing it all. We end up being no different to TradFi in 2008 crisis where loans were packaged with more loans and one default crushed the entire economy.\n\nSorry for the word vomit, this is where I've landed in my learnings so far.",

(Because of this, I would classify this as a degen play)\n\nCharge is a lot newer and had an exploit not too long ago, but they've since fixed it and have set up a way to generate charge for victims.\n\nTomb has lasted a lot longer and did have an exploit to the gatekeeper tax mechanic that has since been removed. The exploit led to people selling out of fear (probably) and nobody bought back bonds to restore the peg. They've since been bought over by a VC who is almost the de-facto spokesperson of Tomb Finance whereas Charge DeFi remains pseudonymous.\n\nThe rebase mechanic only generates yield when the stablecoin is above peg, it doesn't generate you yield if it's below. But for the most part, they tend to hold above peg most of the time (which is what u want if u want to farm the rebases). \nYou could also farm the Liquidity pairs which have really good APRs.\n\nThe yield here is real because it's a reallocation of value to stakers (compared to just inflating a token and redistributing to practically everyone which doesn't generate any real yield). The problem is that demand is the driver of pushing the stablecoin above peg, so this only makes money when the demand is sufficiently high. During debt phases, u could always farm the Liquidity pairs for more consistent yield.\n\nWhen u use auto-compounders, u also add the additional platform/smart contract risk.",

The use case is for those that like the idea of single staking their stable coins at a high % without having to convert it to UST or bridge over to Terra. \n\nA thing to note is that the UST deposit % will be dropping slowly in the near future and Orion's rates will therefore be dropping as well. \n\nPersonally, as a staker and holder of Luna for longer than most, I don't really have a positive look on the protocol as they leverage the Anchor APR without allowing it to have it's intended effect(spread UST adoption). They also bribe people to stake with their validator with Orion tokens, which has allowed them to be the largest delegated validator even though they don't provide any benefit to Terra and are essentially leaches. That's just my opinion though.",

The version of eth that was before 50% of the network decided to fork will become a new token and nodes will be able to transition between the two during the merge. Whatever one becomes the most popular becomes eth and the other one gets a similar name (like what happened with previous btc hard forks)",

This results in you receiving UST back after 2 weeks. Then use the UST to do a long farm on the same asset. It\u2019s a variation of a delta neutral play as you get the rewards from both sides and not exposed to price of the underlying synthetic asset. \n\nThe thing that appeals to me is the Anchor protocol is one of the safest protocols around and the reward is received in UST, not some farming token. \n\nToo many exploits still happening all over the place. Li Finance, Deus Finance, Agave and Hundred Finance all within the last 2 weeks, it\u2019s just not acceptable",

Someone using the money in their bank account to buy Cash 5 doesn't mean the concept of banking is a joke.  Imo people get way too wrapped up in this stuff.\n\nTo my knowledge, like Ethereum and Hedera haven't stopped development because some people are into memecoins.  It's not a thing.  It's like rejecting e-commerce because there's a site that sells whoopie cushions and fart bombs.\n\nSure some people will get burned but who cares?  Their money, their choice.  Some people bought Enron stock and got burned.  If that made them be like *all investing is a sham and every company is a scam*... I mean it impacted nothing and there are more investors today than ever before.\n\nIt's not a real thing to me.  Crypto is coming whether people like it or not.  Adoption numbers point to this.  If people want to miss out, let them.  Who cares?  It's their money.  People missed out on the internet too.  Missing out on stuff is a part of life.",

In preparing for a worst case scenario, I ''invested/gambled'' ''pocket change'' into Shiba.\n\nThat was a one off. Currently hold no memecoins. I usually do thorough research into projects before buying their coins. Have a bunch of projects nowadays in my portfolio, such as Matic, Avax, Lox, Dot to mention a few.\n\nAt the end of the day though, it's up to everyone to make choices about what they think is best for them.",

As a noob I did stake a fairly low amount a matic, realized I got burnt with gas fees, I  left it there and I am leaving it there until the Eth upgrades are done and see if the gas fees are any better, glad I did because its been my longest HODL, its done pretty well. So why not just hold Eth where ever you have it now and just wait 3 months, the price is certainly going to pump in the lead up. Then just buy into a lower gas chain like Fantom, there is allot of Defi action going on in Fantom right now. But my personal favorite is Harmony, its fractions of a penny gas fees. Every other chain  (besides ETH) including polygon is good for low $ investors like you and I if you are not making many transactions. Why I like Harmony is that I am into Defi Kingdoms and few other defi sites. On DK I am in a staked pool that generates Jewel everyday, so I can claim that $1-$2 a day and restake it in x-jewel and when it builds up to a decent amount take it out, trade jewel for something else, put it in another defi site.  I have assorted sites where I am claiming and or restaking and it costs pennies, if that.\n\nBut to add another thing you can do about the eth gas fees, two actually.\n\nEth gas varies by transaction volume, is there always a high volume ? if no then when is it lower ? Good question.  If you look at the average gas price by time of day on this page:\n\n[https://ethereumprice.org/gas/](https://ethereumprice.org/gas/)\n\nYou will see that times like late saturday night and early sunday morning are lowest. I have no life and get up early so they work for me. :-)\n\nYou can check the actual gas fees: [https://etherscan.io/gastracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker)\n\nof course you can check the gas fee when if you set up a swap in your wallet but not commit.\n\nSpeaking of your wallet, did you know that you can change the gas fee ?  you can first of all pick the low speed (if you dont see this you can simply input the low fee) but you can low ball the fee and see if it takes So back a few months ago I wanted to buy Illuvium, the gas price was around $60, on Sunday morning it was down to $45, I started with inputting $20, it failed but it took $25.\n\nif you are using metamask you can look up how to change gas fees and such, if you dont have a wallet then get one. You can actually buy eth in metamask, it takes you to moonpay I think or transak but they are ok to use, it will be cheaper then transferring it from an exchange",

I'm not affiliated with the project in any way; this is my M.O. for auditing and researching new projects. Open for comments.\n\n===== GENERAL OVERVIEW =====  \n**dApp / Project (Token):** *Backd* (DAO token **BKD** is not yet released.)**GitHub:** [https://github.com/backdfund/webapp](https://github.com/backdfund/)  \n**Contract List:** [https://developers.backd.fund/contracts.html](https://developers.backd.fund/contracts.html)  \n**Network**: Ethereum  \n**Safe Link:** [backd.fund](https://backd.fund)\n\nAlways exercise caution when visiting new DeFi protocols. I recommend setting up an alt-wallet with no funds if you'd like to see viewables.\n\n===== FINANCE OVERVIEW =====  \n**TVL:** $93.9m | ATOW  \n**Main Protocols Used:** Convex Finance, Aave, Compound. The latter two are viewable in their contracts under:  \n\\>>> backdfund / webapp / src / lib / contracts /  \n**Core Strategies:** Current strategies revolve around Convex (which is a Curve-based yield platform: see [https://www.convexfinance.com/](https://www.convexfinance.com/)) in the form of **BkdTriHopCvx**, **BkdEthCvx**. The strategies are outlined in the GitBook here: [https://docs.backd.fund/protocol-architecture/pools/strategies](https://docs.backd.fund/protocol-architecture/pools/strategies). ~~Strategy specs are 403 Forbidden (inaccessible without permissions)~~ **\\[edit: these have been updated by Max.\\]** and contracts are Solidity-based (.sol), which are linked but result in dead links (404). The current strategies (Cookbook Recipes) are viewable here: [https://docs.backd.fund/community/cookbook](https://docs.backd.fund/community/cookbook), though they do not outline the aforementioned strategies. All currently posted Recipes involve incurring leverage against BTC or ETH (borrowing money with BTC / ETH as collateral) **\\[edit: Recipes are demonstrative of how one can interact with Backd\\]**.\n\n===== DAPP OVERVIEW =====  \nThe liquidity overflow is as-follows:\n\n1. LPs deposit liquidity into Backd Pools. Additionally, they can stake their LP tokens to Register Backd Actions, where user parameterization (arguments) are defined to 'react' to market conditions, thereby allocating your capital to a more efficient strategy. In this case, that's you, the reader.\n2. LPs earn yield from strategies, BKD (governance token rewards), and Action Fees. You need to load your wallet with ETH and stake LP tokens to register Actions. This isn't available yet.\n3. Backd uses Keeprs, which are off-chain bots that monitor registered liquidity and execute Backd Actions when needed. When a Keeper successfully executes an Action (which is again, predefined by the user via Backd), the Keepers are allocated Backd rewards in the form of LP tokens / BKD. Claiming isn't available yet.\n4. Performance fees are charged on profits and are sent to those who stake BKD, who receive a share of platform fees.\n\n===== RISKS =====  \nContracts are open-sourced, but are not audited. Manual auditing needs to be done by the user before engaging with the dApp.\n\nUsing leveraged positions as core strategies runs the core risk of default by Backd strategy strategists. Additionally, longer-running interest and gas fees may incur cuts into overall profit, in addition to profit cuts taken by Convex Finance.\n\n~~The TriHop strategies are not publicly viewable which incurs a risk to any user not using Discord.~~\n\nGenerally speaking, strategies using >2 asset pools, e.g. tricrypto2 on Curve Finance ([https://curve.fi/](https://curve.fi/)) generate a broad exposure for the end-user. For an average Backd user who deposits cash, they are exposed to roughly 4-7 assets, namely: Curve, Convex, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Compound, Aave, and 3pool (USDT, DAI, USDT) positions. This results in a diversification strategy that reduces generic risk and reduces generic returns.\n\nLP-based strategies always expose users to impermanent loss. An average Backd user is exposed to IL quadratically. For more information on Quaratic Payments and Risks, please read this article by Vitalik Buterin: [https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html)\n\n===== NOTES =====  \nConvex takes 17% of user fees generated via Curve Finance from users who irreversibly stake Curve with Convex in the form of cvxCRV. As a repayment, users receive 10% of Convex LP's boosted CRV earnings, and the CVX governance token.\n\nTherefore, the Backd core strategies abstract the general user from their yield by the fourth degree, or that, after depositing, a user earns \\[Yield - {Curve Fees -} (Convex Fees - Backd Fees) - Gas / Contract Fees\\]. The higher # of degree-abstraction, the more yield is theoretically sifted from the user.\n\nGenerally speaking, this is why I do not think any strategy using Convex Finance is good unless they allow users to retain ownership of tokens. Convex uses collective gauge voting which benefits group power after Convex-platform's power using a more user-friendly interface. This statement's resultant with regards to Curve Finance itself is yet to be seen with how Curve governance will play out.\n\nThe strategy is modified by an exponential degree (*n+1) \\* lnx* where *n* is the amount of of degrees that separate a user from their yields. *n* has a minimum of 1 as it relies on Backd to perform yield-functions for you. *n* increases with the amount of protocols that it directly interacts with - loosely speaking (as fractional usage is possible).\n\n===== TL;DR =====  \nIn its current form, there are better dApps for your money. Yields for DAI, ETH, and USDC are on par with market rates and function similarly to yearn's optimization and market rates (which also use Convex and degrees of leverage, e.g. flash-and-fold strategies on Dai). There is asymmetrical downside risk due to a lack of audits, leverage, and a claim button that is 'Coming Soon.' Abstracting your money in the aforementioned way (diluting your money through various protocols) exposes users to both IL risk and extra fees.\n\nGo-to-direct on Curve or Aave for greater yields.",

As outlined in that blog we are taking our time to establish everything properly. Hence why actions are not available yet. There is tremendous room for growth in adding new Actions and we want the community to be able to propose any Action possible. As you have sensed, ultimately Backd will be a market place of liquidity automation, yield, DeFi Actions, etc.  \n\n\nAnother differentiating factor is that Backd keepers will be decentralized and open source. Of course there is incentive not to do this (keep the fees internal), but through decentralizing it we can build a more robust and efficient network for liquidity delegation.   \n\n\nAlso, regarding your initial comments on protocol security, audits are on the way. But I do understand your remarks, considering that we deploy strategies which always have an inherent risk.   \n\n\nIf you have time and ever want to talk more about Backd feel free to reach out to me over in the Backd Discord.

I'm making over 400% apy the last 2 months with a modest bag of $2500. Recovered gas cost in a little over a week. Tbh I think everyone complaints are greatly exaggerated. \n\nYou have to be more deliberate with the decisions you make because the gas is higher. But that just made me DYOR more intensely. Which I don't think is a bad thing. The TVL exposure on ETH is just many times higher than any other chain at the moment. So if there is the project or pool you want and it's not available anywhere else. Its worth it imo.",

Lol. \n\nNow I pay my parents to help me with my business lol. \n\nIf you have real convictions for ETH, then this shouldn't matter bud. \n\nI believe in ETH and have been stacking it since 2016 man. I ALSO bought at near 5k but I always buy regardless of the price because I believe in ETH. \n\nETH isn't like any other crypto atm that I can see. It's a protocol it's not a crypto. We BUILD on ETH. \n\nYOU GOT THIS DUDE, learn from this and keep on growing my dude you GOT THIS\n\nAlso IF and WHEN ETH is POS the price will go up just because of its nature changing. So I mean hopefully he held it lol my friend got into ETH at 3 and sold at 300. He bought a massive farm and he's happy but you KNOW he's kicking himself when he bought back in at 500 instead of holding.

If I recall BSC its about 30 cents per transaction , but I could be wrong about that. You can look at bscscan to get rough overview of how much transactions cost. \n\nDepending on the exchange you use you can hold your keys relatively easily, just an FYI. For example if you are using gemini , its the only exchange I know that has decent cost to withdraw your crypto. First 10 being free each month, so you could buy at gemini than withdraw whenever you want to your HW with no cost other than the fees to buy your crypto. .25%-.35% depending on the type of order. With my rough napkin math you would have to do at least 120 dollar order to equal amount you would be paying at a cex.  Another thing to keep in mind with DEX not all of them have the ability for limit orders so you will only be able to do market orders. \n\nWith all that being said if you still want to go bep20 route I think best option is to buy your crypto at binance international, binance us only does bep-2 if I recall correctly and that isn't compatible with bep20 you would have to do another conversion using trust wallet or something.  You can look at this [chart](https://www.binance.com/en/fee/cryptoFee) for the fees to withdraw from binance into bep20 form. If it were me I would buy some BNB to pay for fees, I think its total .18 cents to withdraw bnb from binance , and you can buy busd and withdraw as bep20, which if that chart is correct is free. You can buy whatever you want on the other side with your busd and you can use BNB to pay the fees per transaction. \n\nI hope I understood your question correctly, btw you did mention using eth its also costs .18 cents to withdraw eth from binance in bep20 form. It will bep20-eth if you do that.",

Security\n\nIt's considered easy to do one of these things very well if you sacrifice the other two. It's considered difficult to do two of these things very well. It's considered *extremely difficult* to get all three of these things done very well. No blockchain today has achieved it. The closest ones are Bitcoin (does 2 and 3 extremely well) and Ethereum (we can debate this one but I'd argue it does 3 extremely well, 2 pretty good, and 1 maybe average).\n\nThe reason to understand this is that all of these projects you see people shilling in here in many cases SACRIFICE number 2 and often number 3. Sure, they can scale and low fees...but so what? They are vulnerable to exploits, bugs, regulation, centralization risk, etc. \n\nFrom a observer standpoint, it's cool to see new things built. But I'm here to make money. Would I ever invest in these new \"DeFi\" (which as I mentioned they're not decentralized at all)? HELL NO.\n\nI say the only projects you should legit keep an eye on are the front runners for scaling solutions for BTC and ETH. That's it. I personally like ZkSync a lot for ETH, but I haven't seen anything that's caught my eye yet on BTC besides Lightning Network.",

Fantom, Avalanche, Binance, Solana, etc.  but there is only one chain that prioritizes decentralization and security over scalability.  The only way to break the trilemma is to modularize the blockchain and separate execution (performance of the smart contracts), data storage (chain history), and consensus (decentralized validation).  The Ethereum road map prioritizes security and decentralization by maintaining consensus on the main chain.  If you then outsource execution to Layer 2s and shard data history, you get all 3.  Layer 2s on Ethereum will long term be cheaper and faster than any monolithic blockchain can hope to be.  On top of that you do not sacrifice any security or decentralization.  This modular approach is the only current way known to both have low fees and nation state level security.\n\nIf you want to read more, I recommend:\n\nhttps://blockcast.cc/news/co-founder-of-bankless-why-modular-blockchain-design-is-the-future/?amp",

It's not single staking, instead it's a group of tokens in the same vein as tricrypto. But it rewards you with WETH. So it's limited IL and rewards in WETH, on arbitrum later 2 which is much lower fees than ETH but higher than polygon. \n\nFor single lending or staking, check out autocompounders like beefy finance or lending protocols like cream finance, alpha finance, etc on multiple chains",

Given the threat of loss of all or a portion of your stake, it is in your best interest to not cheat the network and on the other hand would be extremely cost prohibitive to try to cheat the network\n\nAnother confusing problem you will run into on this sub in particular is that many people conflate \"staking\" which refers to participating in the consensus mechanism of a proof of stake protocol with depositing your crypto tokens into a centralized crypto bank/money market that lends out your crypto to other parties and gives you a percentage of the yield.

Buy only 1 to 4 nodes to begin with. Higher earnings if your vpnd is below 4,999. \nThen autocompound on day 7. \nYou'll get both the autocompounding and diamond hands level 2 bonuses, increasing your daily earnings quite a bit per day. \n\nThis is why vapornodes is the best for stable passive income. Cheapest nodes, good strategies to increase earnings from a small investment, and they've proven they will have a longer sustainable shelf life. \n\nEven buying 1 node, with the strategy above, you can earn up to $10 per day. Not bad for a $60 investment. By day 7, you'll already have earned most of your initial investment back. With Diamondhands and Autocomp, you increase your profit and will have your initial investment back by day 8 or 9. Continue to follow this strategy and do this every 7 to 14 days on each node. Every day you earn more passive income, which is now 100% profit after day 8. Use the same strategy on all 4 nodes and don't combine them until you understand how much it'll decrease your daily profit compared to keeping them separate bc lower tiers make more.\n\nIt's been a good stable investment for me. Here's my referral link if you'd like to try. Don't feel you have to use my referral code / link. I'm not trying to shill it. \n\nhttps://app.vapornodes.finance/nodes?invite=0x0a763B204ce0638Eb80860a96221D5766D96926D\n\nI've been helping many ppl understand defi and how to make real money with different protocols on this channel and other socials, as I've been in Crypto and defi for many years, with lessons learned. \n\nHope this helps!",

You learn about tokenomics, how lending and borrowing works, what a collateral is, you learn about inflation and a whole lot of other useful things you will also find in traditional finance. \n\n2) DeFi protocols are not a black-box like many traditional financial products. They are based on code, executed very fast by computers and anyone can check the code. Big, big plus. \n\nDeFi will roll over traditional finance like an avalanche in the upcoming years.",

                    "response": "My early impression of this gamefi is that trading card and RTS games are the most easy to design or port into this sector. These games really are just Defi platforms with a game UI. The economy centers around purchasing products, staking, and buying/selling in-game assets. Take Splinterlands for example: initial steps to play/generate income require the purchase of an in-game product. From there, the players may play for free to slowly accumulate rewards, or can participate in the game's NFT marketplace to buy or rent better cards to generate better rewards faster via grinding through ranked play.\n\nThe rewards of the games native currency can then be staked or placed into LP's for further rewards. It's a staking, nft market place, and lending platform, built around a trading card game. Gods Unchained has a similar experience, albeit with richer gameplay. \n\nIts these aspects that allow a game to be a functional Defi vector. I can see these games getting exponentially richer and satisfying once AAA developers enter the frey. Further, just like the rest of the crypto sphere, I see early adopters reaping huge benefits for embracing gamefi. \n\nKeeping reading news sources for hints of big developers partnering with networks. I myself am vigilant for the first signs of Wizards of the Coast partnering to develop any of their games for web3.",

For example, the AXS token of the blockchain game Axie Infinity rose by more than 1500% in three months, breaking into the top 50 assets in terms of capitalization and making it into global financial media.\n\nUh, sure, but you're neglecting to mention that \"gaming\" tokens also crashed, including AXS, and in fact did worse since November than Ethereum or other safe bets.\n\nThe problem is, these \"gaming\" tokens have nothing to do with actual games. There's no actual players.\n\nTo be clear, if you're paying someone to do something, it's not a game it's a job, and they're not a player, they're an employee. If you pay people to do something, *obviously* people will do it, but that doesn't make money for your platform, it just creates fake involvement.\n\nA real game has actual players, who are playing the game *for* *fun*, not *for* *money.* And the way a real game makes money is that people are willing to *pay* to play it. Let's get this straight: in a real game, payers pay the game maker, not the other way around.\n\nEvery single game or game platform mentioned in this thread is just minting coins and paying people to do worthless tasks so they can pretend they have high player numbers, but that's just a lie. All these games and game platforms have close to 0 actual players. These platforms are *losing* money, not making it, and the only reason their coins have ever gone up in value is that there are suckers willing to speculate on the coins because they don't understand what's going on.\n\nOf course, there's plenty of potential for a game to start that doesn't do this stupid play-to-earn crap, but so far even the most promising games (even Gods Unchained, sadly) have all fallen into this trap.\n\nTL;DR: These coins are *terrible* investments. If you don't get out while they're up, they'll go down and never come back.",

If you don't mind me sharing a few examples. Not shilling just giving you some real world examples I personally have experienced and seen recently. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* A few of my friends who were totally anti-crypto started playing a Play2Earn game called DogemonGO ([https://twitter.com/DogemonGoApp](https://twitter.com/DogemonGoApp)) similar to PokemonGo but for Crypto. They are hooked and this led to them wanting to learn more about the metaverse, NFTs etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* My cousin is a gamer. Loves Dota. He came across a project via an add on Twitter called Ulti Arena ([https://ultiarena.com/app/play-to-earn](https://ultiarena.com/app/play-to-earn)) that allowed him to earn money while playing Dota based on his performance in the game. Imagine when they add more off-chain games like League of Legends & Counter Strike how many people who are not in the crypto scene will jump on as they can basically play their favorite game and earn while doing so!\n\nInterested to hear other real world examples from the rest of you folks!",

Real farmers just chase the yield for short term. For 90% of the retail market out there is as long as it pumps, it will be  a good coin, regardless it is decentralized or not.

The bonded asset is then locked and the UST is borrowed at a protocol defined LTV rate which is currently 40% max.  Anchor Protocol works using a liquid staking mechanism.  Staking rewards earned by borrowers in bLUNA are liquidated by the protocol to UST allowing depositors to achieve target returns of up to 20%.\n Even though 20% APY sounds too good to be true, it's real.  Anchor protocol can provide at least 24% stake income on deposits as a result of 12% annual LUNA stake yield and maximum LTV rate.  Also, the loans are over-collateralised, which means betting rewards are magnified, further contributing to the higher interest rate.  Even though the system can provide returns above 20%, by fixing it at 20%, Anchor provides a reliable and stable return.",

But I was surprised to see such strong effects within my simulation using TVLs close to reality. Of course, in the real world other forms of arbitrage can be exploited in situations like the one I wrote about affecting the outcome. A closed system assumption is usually only useful for exploratory analysis.\n\n> If you substitute all mentions of \"DEX\" in your article for \"Coinbase trading pair\" the analysis will still hold\n\nYou're correct, the analogy holds, though it's harder to quantify since order books can be more easily changed without any transaction really going through (ex: order cancellation).",

                    "response": "I'd be very, very careful with using Youtube for a source of information on potential investments. This is for 2 main reasons:\n\n* Human feelings can be influenced with music and sounds, from repetitive church songs and religious chanting to the way movies guide a viewer on an emotional journey. This can be used to make you feel more positive about a project than you would otherwise.\n\n* Watching a video is a passive activity that takes you through a presentation at a pace determined by the creator. If you were reading something you would naturally stop and think about or check things you aren't sure of. With a video, stopping requires you to actively decide to pause it, which though theoretically a low barrier, in reality many more falsehoods or questionable claims will slip pass your natural bullshit detecting abilities.\n\nMy advice would be to pick projects to research one at a time. Go through their whitepapers, looking up anything you don't understand. It makes sense to start with Bitcoin, just because the white paper is pretty short and not particularly complicated. It will also give you some idea of what to look for in terms of legitimacy. It explains what the issue is that the project tries to solve and then how it works.\n\nWhere you go from there is up to you, but my suggestion would be to try your best to avoid listening to anyone's opinion on a project and instead dig into the fundamentals as much as you can yourself. If you understand how something works better than most other people you have a chance to make investment choices better than them. If you follow others you'll always be behind them.",

Make sure you have at least a rough understanding of:\n\n* public-key cryptography and blockchain\n* proof of work and the consensus mechanism used by e.g. bitcoin\n* proof of stake and the consensus mechanism used by e.g. polkadot\n* hardware and software crypto wallets\n* evm, erc-20, nfts\n\nthese are the drop dead basics of the technology you would be investing in. You'll also want to make sure you understand the common ways that people get scammed and lose their ass:\n\n* notable pyramid schemes, hacks, and rug pulls that have happened in the crypto space\n* phishing scams; clipboard address manipulation; fake websites, wallets, and browser extensions\n* how to secure your keys/seed phrases and under what circumstances you should ever enter them\n\nand assuming you're here because you're interested in defi:\n\n* decentralized exchanges and automated market makers\n* liquidity pools\n* liquidity providing, impermanent loss\n* autocompounders and yield farming\n\n[this guy](https://www.youtube.com/c/Finematics/videos) has some good introductory videos on these topics\n\nnow you should know enough to dive in to those top 50 cryptocurrencies you were talking about. I would approach it like this:\n\n1. for each of those projects, get a quick and rough understanding of what they're about by reading the landing page of their website or the coinmarketcap overview summary\n2. figure out which projects you are interested in. Join subreddits for those projects, look for youtubers talking about it, check out the project's site in more detail. If it's an app, connect your wallet and look around the interface\n3. pick which projects you want to invest in. Make sure you understand the sites and software used with the project. If you want to be diligent, read the project's whitepaper, documentation pages, and audit reports if they have them. It might also be a good idea to throw in a smaller amount to play around with first and get comfortable",

                    "response": "I've learnt a few things the wrong hard way and I believe we - investors - all have the responsibility to share as much practical and honest knowledge to newcomers as possible. So here goes:\n\n\\- We all come to the markets to make profit, and with that in mind you'd benefit from learning some trading fundamentals (I can recommend watching some of the Trader's Realiy youtube streams for that). The basics are: setting up your Tradingview account and enabling the technical indicators that I find most useful to guess action price - Volume candles and Divergences (in RSI and MACD mostly). Those two will tell you where to expect prices to go and when a trend change in price action may happen.\n\n\\- In regards to DeFi, you can consider reading the Medium pages project descriptions of some of the most promising projects out there and consider staking / farming their tokens for a while. Check the top chains on DefiLlama site, and check the top protocols (by TVL) hosted there. For instance under Terra Chain you have Astroport Protocol with good farming incentives - if you add some money to the ASTRO-UST pool, you'll be earning 66% APR + the benefit of ASTRO token speculative action - many of us, including myself, think that this project has it all to perform well in the markets and make you some money, specially as it is still such a new project waiting for price discovery mode. Other promising DeFi projects may include Reactor Money, Yeti Finance etc - but read their medium pages and check their discord channels (and if you have the technical knowledge also their whitepapers) to judge them by yourself.\n\n\\- Lastely, please understand that the whole crypto market - DeFi included obviously - is heavily dependent on the performance of Bitcoin. So if it goes up, the whole market will go up and vice versa. Bitcoin should therefore be the top coin you're analysing everyday on TradingView to make up your mind in regards to market health/momentum.\n\n\\- Extra tip: don't fall for emotions, don't fall for youtubers/twitter guys backing coins based on generic creative reasonings, don't follow people who claim to be leaders in trading. This will be a lonely journey of self learning and emotional control, and that's how it goes for everyone. Good luck and happy profits, I hope you'll nail it soon.",

What I would suggest is you start by watching the first few MIT videos on crypto led by Gary Gensler so you get a basic understanding of Bitcoin, the Blockchain and crypto in general (a simple Google search will find it).\n\nNext, I suggest you subscribe to Coin Bureau on Youtube and search for videos on investing, how to choose cryptos to invest in, and so on.\n\nFinally, setup an account on a crypto exchange of your choice and buy a little bit of BTC and/or ETH to get acquainted with the process. As you do this, you'll come across things that will prompt you to do further research (e.g. gas fees, choosing networks to send crypto on, etc.) So you can develop a better understanding of crypto. I started off by using Shakepay to buy cryptos, however the Crypto.com app should also be easy to use.\n\nGood luck OP and have fun!\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention one of the most important things for crypto noobs to learn: please, please research crypto scams and how to avoid them. I like to think I'm pretty smart and cautious, but I STILL got scammed very early on. Don't assume you won't fall for it. Inform yourself and you won't get rekt.",

I will honestly tell you that to make that potential 5x you have to look beyond the top 50 cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere are other areas of the crypto market you can look at ranging from NFT to gamefi to web3. I will want to recommend Cometh which allows you stake MUST on its dex Comethswap and still be able to play strategic card games to earn rewards like the $30,000 rewards for april.\n\nThis and many more are opportunities you might decide to explore during your crypto journey.",

Commit 40 hrs a week to learning, understand DeFi, NFTs, Metaverse etc. and you will be good to go. I did that, and was up to speed, and I was able to buy the likes of BTC, ETH , SOL, ALGO, CHR, AXL, RFOX, SPOOL.\n\nAnd most importantly, I keep doing my research on any project before investing, Good luck",

Just type the name of protocol + docs. I've started researching kalmy and beefy but now I'm also using pancake and curve.

The use case is for those that like the idea of single staking their stable coins at a high % without having to convert it to UST or bridge over to Terra. \n\nA thing to note is that the UST deposit % will be dropping slowly in the near future and Orion's rates will therefore be dropping as well. \n\nPersonally, as a staker and holder of Luna for longer than most, I don't really have a positive look on the protocol as they leverage the Anchor APR without allowing it to have it's intended effect(spread UST adoption). They also bribe people to stake with their validator with Orion tokens, which has allowed them to be the largest delegated validator even though they don't provide any benefit to Terra and are essentially leaches. That's just my opinion though.",

                    "response": "Arbitrage is the exploitation of market-inefficient miniscule price differences resulting in profit.\n\nInvestopedia is a great resource for reading about financial concepts as-an-introduction. Read more here: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp)\n\nYou can use any type of exchange to perform arbitrage on two different markets, including DeFi. The simplest example of correctional arbitrage is on stablecoins.\n\nTake, for example, stablecoin Dai, whose peg errors around 1/1000th on accuracy:\n\n* When Dai drops below its peg, say, $0.9995 / DAI, purchasing it results in an effective 1.000500250125063 Dai. For simplicity, we'll round to 1.0005 Dai per-unit, not accounting for price impact on purchasing.\n* When Dai pulls above its peg, say, $1.0005 / DAI, selling it results in an effective profit of \\~$0.001 for 1 unit of Dai. Again, this doesn't account for price impact of purchasing or selling (as purchasing a large lot may result in pushing it over its peg and vice versa) which will affect the relative profit (it will diminish by purchasing larger lots, and you must account for fees in your model).\n\nTo answer your question, yes, you can make money on arbitrage. You can run it across multiple markets, but for beginners, work with stablecoins on 1-2 markets to maintain its peg. This is how Coinbase, for example, was able to offer 2.00% on Dai versus USDC (as Dai has more volatility). TerraUSD, as an alternative example, was pricier to purchase in lots recently, with a peg at $1.0005, resulting in better sells and more expensive purchases. Arbitrage is actually quite important right now given how every stablecoin uses a peg with a 1/1000th degree of accuracy.\n\nYou will need to calculate maximal efficiency of arbitrage to a very fine detail which can be achieved with models that utilize calculus (integration calculus to start). You can then code or fork a bot that is designed for arbitrage and then integrate it into multiple exchange APIs or DeFi apps. \n\nIf you want to test your model, you can go to r/algotrading and get some feedback on backtesting them.",

I\u2019m quite impressed with your analysis as a whole and the nice thing is that you can modify the model as you see fit to assess the impact on results.\n\nRegarding the halvings, I have considered how to represent this before and I\u2019m just not sure. It almost always leads me to something that looks logarithmic though.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve come to is that there are competing effects\u2026namely the reduction in block reward driving scarcity of supply pitted against (assumed) ever-increasing institutional adoption. I think as the former progresses, it will drive demand up especially in light of the significant amount of institutional accumulation that has and will continue to happen. That said, with that accumulation, we could see a reduction in volatility due to the broader/mainstream market recognizing a more stable valuation versus fiat as compared to today\u2019s sentiment that crypto is still largely a speculative asset.\n\nI could go on and on, but I still don\u2019t think I know enough to know (nor does anyone, right?), so testing various approaches in your model may have the effect of bounding the cases in the very least and I believe that is still a valuable message to convey.\n\nLooking forward to your future work!",

So, essentially what is happening with Terra right now is that there\u2019s a large pot of money in Anchor that people deposit into and that others can borrow from by locking up LUNA or ETH.\n\nWhen you do this from the borrow side, you mint bLUNA or bETH which gives you an amount of UST that you can borrow from at an interest rate that\u2019s pretty high (~13% last I checked). You can\u2019t burn your bLUNA or bETH back for LUNA or ETH (unlock it) unless you pay back what you borrowed.\n\nIf you can\u2019t pay back what you borrowed, you\u2019re able to burn your collateral LUNA or ETH (in forms bLUNA or bETH) to pay it back. In crypto terms this is actually a relatively safe way to borrow more than you have in order to see a gain that\u2019s greater because you\u2019re *leveraging* UST to expand your capital base.\n\nThis is further amplified by Mirror Protocol (which allows premium, synthetic shorting) and other Terra-based protocols including Astroport.\n\nIn short: borrow UST on margin to make more money. If you can\u2019t, they take your collateral in the form of LUNA or ETH that\u2019s bonded. This is generally known as leveraging.",

Also due to the Anchor protocol being heavier on the lend side than borrow side, and the UST degenbox pool on abracadabra.money, it's only a matter of time before the \"bank run\" happens. The reason I say that about the abracadabra.money offer is because it leverages loops. So instead of 20%/yearly you can get upwards of 100%+ after leveraging. It's known to be draining the rewards pool right now.\n\nMAI is simply I don't know enough about it, which means I stay away.\n\nKeep in mind it seems like every defi protocol has some new stable coin. Most of these will fail due to the tokenomics or lack of adoption but they all want to be the \"DAI killer\".\n\nAlso no stable coin are 100% \"stable\". They all fluctuate slightly, and UST/USDC/MIM all have large amounts of money still locked. It's just a matter of time that we go through a stable coin shakeout.

Thirdly, it's used by giant market makers like Alameda and Cumberland despite being shady. I guess they know something that put them at ease using Tether?! Lastly, there are no perfect stables at the moment. **NONE** of them has been audited. There have been only attestation reports which Tether has one too.\n\nPersonally, I'd stay away from anything centralized so it doesn't freeze my crypto whenever it feels like it or government tells it to.",

None of these have any way of blocking assets of users (ie. blacklisting the tokens at a certain address from being moved), which is extremelly important imho. No matter what you do with your stablecoins, I believe supporting and using properly non-censorable options should be high on everyone's priorities list.\n\nAny algorithmic stablecoins are yet to fully prove themselves, though FRAX is looking good so far (only partially algorithmic afaik).",

The ecosystem is pioneering CosmWasm development and adoption.\r  \n\r  \nJuno as a layer 1 smart contract network solves the first generation smart contract bottlenecks which are limited scalability, high cost for deployment and execution and offers an easy environment for developers across the globe to deploy scalable, secure decentralized applications efficiently.\r  \n\r  \nCosmWasm, enables WebAssembly (WASM) virtual machines (VMs). WebAssembly allows for software written in many languages to run securely on a blockchain. WASM serves as an intermediate language that compiles the developer\u2019s language of choice into a portable virtual machine. This means that you can have a simple, secure and fast virtual machine set up to sandbox or partition your application\u2019s actions for better testing, security, performance and speed.\"\n\n[https://www.junonetwork.io/](https://www.junonetwork.io/)\n\nThe team has also delivered many2 cool toolings such as:\n\n1. Junotools -  a multi purpose dApp for interacting with various smart contracts on Juno Network\n2.  Juno Swap Dex - a DEX built on Juno\n3.  DAO\\_DAO - a DAO that builds DAO tooling for anyone\n4.  DAO\\_UP - the crowdfunding platform for DAO\n5. (de)ns - Decentralized DNS on Juno network",

Security\n\nIt's considered easy to do one of these things very well if you sacrifice the other two. It's considered difficult to do two of these things very well. It's considered *extremely difficult* to get all three of these things done very well. No blockchain today has achieved it. The closest ones are Bitcoin (does 2 and 3 extremely well) and Ethereum (we can debate this one but I'd argue it does 3 extremely well, 2 pretty good, and 1 maybe average).\n\nThe reason to understand this is that all of these projects you see people shilling in here in many cases SACRIFICE number 2 and often number 3. Sure, they can scale and low fees...but so what? They are vulnerable to exploits, bugs, regulation, centralization risk, etc. \n\nFrom a observer standpoint, it's cool to see new things built. But I'm here to make money. Would I ever invest in these new \"DeFi\" (which as I mentioned they're not decentralized at all)? HELL NO.\n\nI say the only projects you should legit keep an eye on are the front runners for scaling solutions for BTC and ETH. That's it. I personally like ZkSync a lot for ETH, but I haven't seen anything that's caught my eye yet on BTC besides Lightning Network.",

We may see some idle funds yield farming if it is in highly liquid investments, similar to money market funds. However, large corporations are typically risk averse and focus more on preservation of capital than earning a return on it. Catch my drift? We'll get there eventually, but insurance needs to grow massively, and the overall safety of DeFi needs to improve for these large caps to get involved.",

There is a strong narrative that retail drives cryptocurrency prices (though we know that institutions and the same old money capital of the stock market have their hands deep in this world too), so they feel as though they are able to invest AND buck the system at the same time, which is appealing in a way that the stock market isn't\n\nWould love to hear what other peoples' anecdotal experiences are with actual kids and crypto.",

A high interest rate is directly related to the risk-free asset and increases the cost of capital and risk aversion. Any project, no matter how good, will become more expensive.\n\nI disagree that there will be \"less money available to borrow\". There will be money available yes, but it will cost more. The question is: Is a project good enough to be paid with more expensive funds? There are many out there that really are.\n\n2- I agree with \"soon there won't be enough liquid capital for these xxx% APY\u2019s\". Some platforms will vanish since they are not sustainable, but others will prevail. My bets are (few examples): Circle (over 20B of AUM last time I've seen), SwissBorg (an Unicorn), Yield App (launched a new platform, growing fast with 450M AUM) and Nexo (huge variety of assets).\n\n3- I disagree. FED does not scare me. Jerry (Jerome Powell) needs to do something, right? It's his job. FED is fighting the highest inflation in 40 years. But he has a huge problem called mainly \"USDC\". Issued by Circle, closer to regulatory boards, audited by a Top5 and becoming hugely popular with the total supply surpassing USDT on Ethereum for the first time. This is going to be even tougher to him after DeFi 2.0 that will surely increase digital asset's adoption.\n\n4- It makes two of us for this: \"I have a \u201csafe\u201d job and a \u201csafe\u201d amount of money invested into traditional stocks and ETFs\". I hodl so many ETFs that I can't remember how many, mainly on disruptive technology, AI and ML. ARKF, ARKK, IHF, IXN and many stocks. I go with Buffet for this one: \"Never bet against America\".\n\n5- \"I mainly use crypto as a high interest savings account\". I have no idea what you are talking about, man. The words \"high interest\" and \"savings\" just blew my mind out :)\n\nI like your strategy with NEAR protocol, but I didn't have enough time to make a deep research on it. Maybe you could diversify more. Exactly because of this that I'm using multiple platforms (Swiss, Circle, Yield...)  and the highest APY I have comes from USDC on Yield (18% + 12% on locked YLD). I have a double-digit inflation where I live and staking is the only way.\n\nLet's hodl our ETFs, stocks and crypto strong and keep enjoying those APYs.",

Everything about a coin can be great, and something unforseeable can come along and cause the coin to fail. This is why even the best analysts *often* make incorrect predictions, and I doubt you're one of the best analysts. If NEAR fails, your entire plan is gonna fail. The best analysts know they're fallible and diversify, and so should you.\n\n>Ref will grow linearly with NEAR and automatically diversity across and entire L1.\n\nREF *will not* grow linearly with NEAR. Look at [these tokenomics](https://guide.ref.finance/tokenomics). You're looking at 50% dilution over the next 4 years. And if NEAR grows, other DEXs will launch on NEAR, which will split the subeconomy.\n\nAnd REF won't diversify across the entire L1. The REF coin staking is a bet on *trading volume*, not on *price,* and it's quite possible for coins in the ecosystem to go up in price without a lot of trading volume. If anything, a downward market causes more trading volume than an upward market: look at the graph on the right side of [this page](https://info.uniswap.org/) and you'll see more volume the last few days due to panic trading than in any previous weeks.\n\nMake no mistake, you're not diversified. You're in two coins (NEAR and REF) staked in two pools that depend on transaction and trading volume on one chain.\n\nI am not sure I'd even invest in this strategy *at all*, let alone put my entire crypto bags in it. It's not an insane strategy as part of a diversified portfolio, but I don't like those REF tokenomics. And it IS an insane strategy if you're closing your savings account and putting it all in this.",

But I was surprised to see such strong effects within my simulation using TVLs close to reality. Of course, in the real world other forms of arbitrage can be exploited in situations like the one I wrote about affecting the outcome. A closed system assumption is usually only useful for exploratory analysis.\n\n> If you substitute all mentions of \"DEX\" in your article for \"Coinbase trading pair\" the analysis will still hold\n\nYou're correct, the analogy holds, though it's harder to quantify since order books can be more easily changed without any transaction really going through (ex: order cancellation).",

Your closed system analysis can be expanded to MEV as these arbitrage actions happen entirely on chain and exist within a transparent closed system (1 block).\n\nAnyway, that's just an idea for a future article.",

This is for 2 main reasons:\n\n* Human feelings can be influenced with music and sounds, from repetitive church songs and religious chanting to the way movies guide a viewer on an emotional journey. This can be used to make you feel more positive about a project than you would otherwise.\n\n* Watching a video is a passive activity that takes you through a presentation at a pace determined by the creator. If you were reading something you would naturally stop and think about or check things you aren't sure of. With a video, stopping requires you to actively decide to pause it, which though theoretically a low barrier, in reality many more falsehoods or questionable claims will slip pass your natural bullshit detecting abilities.\n\nMy advice would be to pick projects to research one at a time. Go through their whitepapers, looking up anything you don't understand. It makes sense to start with Bitcoin, just because the white paper is pretty short and not particularly complicated. It will also give you some idea of what to look for in terms of legitimacy. It explains what the issue is that the project tries to solve and then how it works.\n\nWhere you go from there is up to you, but my suggestion would be to try your best to avoid listening to anyone's opinion on a project and instead dig into the fundamentals as much as you can yourself. If you understand how something works better than most other people you have a chance to make investment choices better than them. If you follow others you'll always be behind them.",

I would approach it like this:\n\n1. for each of those projects, get a quick and rough understanding of what they're about by reading the landing page of their website or the coinmarketcap overview summary\n2. figure out which projects you are interested in. Join subreddits for those projects, look for youtubers talking about it, check out the project's site in more detail. If it's an app, connect your wallet and look around the interface\n3. pick which projects you want to invest in. Make sure you understand the sites and software used with the project. If you want to be diligent, read the project's whitepaper, documentation pages, and audit reports if they have them.

                    "response": "I've learnt a few things the wrong hard way and I believe we - investors - all have the responsibility to share as much practical and honest knowledge to newcomers as possible. So here goes:\n\n\\- We all come to the markets to make profit, and with that in mind you'd benefit from learning some trading fundamentals (I can recommend watching some of the Trader's Realiy youtube streams for that). The basics are: setting up your Tradingview account and enabling the technical indicators that I find most useful to guess action price - Volume candles and Divergences (in RSI and MACD mostly). Those two will tell you where to expect prices to go and when a trend change in price action may happen.\n\n\\- In regards to DeFi, you can consider reading the Medium pages project descriptions of some of the most promising projects out there and consider staking / farming their tokens for a while. Check the top chains on DefiLlama site, and check the top protocols (by TVL) hosted there. For instance under Terra Chain you have Astroport Protocol with good farming incentives - if you add some money to the ASTRO-UST pool, you'll be earning 66% APR + the benefit of ASTRO token speculative action - many of us, including myself, think that this project has it all to perform well in the markets and make you some money, specially as it is still such a new project waiting for price discovery mode. Other promising DeFi projects may include Reactor Money, Yeti Finance etc - but read their medium pages and check their discord channels (and if you have the technical knowledge also their whitepapers) to judge them by yourself.\n\n\\- Lastely, please understand that the whole crypto market - DeFi included obviously - is heavily dependent on the performance of Bitcoin. So if it goes up, the whole market will go up and vice versa. Bitcoin should therefore be the top coin you're analysing everyday on TradingView to make up your mind in regards to market health/momentum.\n\n\\- Extra tip: don't fall for emotions, don't fall for youtubers/twitter guys backing coins based on generic creative reasonings, don't follow people who claim to be leaders in trading. This will be a lonely journey of self learning and emotional control, and that's how it goes for everyone. Good luck and happy profits, I hope you'll nail it soon.",

What I would suggest is you start by watching the first few MIT videos on crypto led by Gary Gensler so you get a basic understanding of Bitcoin, the Blockchain and crypto in general (a simple Google search will find it).\n\nNext, I suggest you subscribe to Coin Bureau on Youtube and search for videos on investing, how to choose cryptos to invest in, and so on.\n\nFinally, setup an account on a crypto exchange of your choice and buy a little bit of BTC and/or ETH to get acquainted with the process. As you do this, you'll come across things that will prompt you to do further research (e.g. gas fees, choosing networks to send crypto on, etc.) So you can develop a better understanding of crypto. I started off by using Shakepay to buy cryptos, however the Crypto.com app should also be easy to use.\n\nGood luck OP and have fun!\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention one of the most important things for crypto noobs to learn: please, please research crypto scams and how to avoid them. I like to think I'm pretty smart and cautious, but I STILL got scammed very early on. Don't assume you won't fall for it. Inform yourself and you won't get rekt.",

So, quickly I'm just going to make an assumption that this is post-tax 10m just to make the calculations easier.    \n    \nTo start us off, I will need regular cash flow to be able to function as a human and to be able to continually invest to maintain my wealth so I would put **2.25M into stablecoin staking and LP pools**. The majority would be in Anchor protocol and beefy finance, which I pretty confidently could achieve around *14-18% APR* which would be between **315k-405k p/a**. This would be roughly 10-12x anything I have earnt, so living on this would be incredibly easy for me.    \n    \n**1M would automatically go to various family and friends to help pay off any debts any of them have.** I also would get them gifts to show appreciation to them because life is short and if I can't treat the people I love with the money I earn then what's the point.    \n    \n**1M would be split between eth and BTC,** mainly because they are just the 2 biggest blue chips in crypto and will not be going anywhere very soon. With eth merge coming in June, I really don't see eth's potential slowing down.    \n    \n**1M would be for Luna,** I have been a part of the Terra community since around this time last year and have seen the Terraform labs move from strength to strength to protect the integrity of the peg of UST and to push for more developers to build on the chain. I believe their history of payment management with Chai will prove vital for them when stablecoins see mass adoption.    \n    \n**4M will be for moving to Monaco.** Absolutely beautiful place with lovely weather all year round, most importantly for me: *zero income tax, zero capital gains tax and zero wealth tax.* Not only this, but I am a huge fan of F1 and being able to enjoy the spectacle of the Monaco GP every year would be a dream. The reason why so much is because to become a resident you need at least 500k in a Monaco bank account, private medical insurance and a residence (which can be anything from 1.5-2.5m for a  decent place).    \n    \n**350k would be for ETFs.** This would just be a range to cover different sectors of the market. I\u2019d most likely go for S&P500, FTSE100, Global Clean Energy, Emerging market, Tech, Silver etc. These are literally the safest investments in the market, it would be a set it and forget it investment.    \n    \n**104k would be for regular DCA of altcoins,** this would be so I could have about 2k a week to invest in random altcoins I find interesting or present new technology or are in the early stages of development. This would be with the money I'm okay with losing - to an extent - but could see potential upside if I am able to get into a project relatively early.    \n    \n**For the remaining 296k,** I would just treat myself to whatever I wanted. I really like a *Mercedes SL 73 AMG,* a beautiful convertible car with a v12 engine. Would be nice to drive around Monaco. I'd also let my inner 10-year old enjoy having all the games consoles I want and a nice new PC, I mean we don't have to be completely sensible about everything we spend.    \n    \nBit lengthy, but this is a rough template of what I would do if I suddenly got 10m. I have treated my family and friends, gained 6 figure salary, and millions in assets with a great likelihood of gaining in value, I get to move to Monaco and I get to treat myself. Not much more you could ask for IMO.",

They charge 15% fee for things like customer support and some unique products (like lending / staking). If you're in to Liquidity Mining you can achieve the same thing in a non custodial fashion using the [DeFiChain Lite Wallet](https://defichain.com/downloads) and earn a higher yield (47.05% APR / 59.75% APY for ETH/DFI), plus you will receive payments every few minutes. I moved from CakeDeFi to DeFiChain native (first the Windows wallet now the iOS wallet) over a year ago and I'm very impressed with it all. There's also a [sub for DeFiChain users](https://reddit.com/r/defiblockchain)",

I've also had good success with LinkedIn for applying to jobs. \n\nThe pay is significantly higher, but the risk is exponentially higher as well. You're basically one exploit away from being unemployed, entire chains can become unprofitable overnight, platforms disappear, CEO's rob people, etc. There's a reason the pay is better it's the Wild West. \n\nPersonally the more I think about it the less I'm tempted by it, but still doing the interview since I'm curious what the founder has to say.",

Feel free to check out [https://cryptocurrencyjobs.co/](https://cryptocurrencyjobs.co/) or similar sites\n\nFrom my perspective, it's really important to:  \n1. Understand the field. You can use something like [https://www.odysseydao.com/articles/what-is-bitcoin](https://www.odysseydao.com/articles/what-is-bitcoin) to get started\n\n2. Understand what you are good at/who you want to be based on your experience. Read descriptions carefully to find a perfect match according to your skills. You want to be sure you are motivated not only by industry vibe or salary, but by everyday tasks\n\n3. Double-check the company. How old the company is, what are the reviews, how management treats you during the interview - it's all important",

Older tech in schools isn't necessarily all that bad, you still get core information that you will use your entire life. Speak up when your school is too far behind the times, they may adjust their curriculum.\n\nI'm no crypto expert but I have worked in the IT industry for 20+ years at many levels and have  a couple IT degrees. The biggest advice I can give anyone that plans on going to college is do not expect what you learn at school to push you into the industry full tilt because you will most likely be disappointed. Now don't get me wrong, pretty much any degree is a REALLY good thing, but what I am saying is, do your research, pick where you want to land, and while going to school and passing your classes, do independent research and studies to excel at what you really want to do. You will still have to get in on an entry level but your chances of quickly moving up the ladder will greatly increase if you walk in pretty much ready to rock and roll. Beyond that, experience will become your greatest job hunting asset. I suggest starting off by finding a public project you really like, and getting involved even in the most basic level (documentation, user support, whatever you can pull off that helps).\n\n\"in schools they teach very old and traditional stuff\": You are right! BUT, always remember that older core stuff will be the foundation upon which you build everything else. Although syntactically there are differences between programming languages, the core tools used in programming are the same. Things like variables, constants, objects, arrays, classes, methods are pretty much universal for every programming language.\n\nAlso, when you see the school is lacking in an area, say something. When I started my IT courses back in 2000, I complained that there was no Linux in the curriculum. I had some pretty decent Linux experience at the time and told them it is the future (and now look, almost everything \"smart\" is using a form of Linux/Unix). I wound up spending the entire next year maintaining their new Unix/Linux lab because the instructors only knew what the book taught them to teach. I did it for free and I learned a LOT by unbreaking machine after machine. We then convinced them to move to Vmware the next year. You can influence the quality of education for future students in a big way doing stuff like this. Just be respectful when you communicate where they are lacking.",

The self-taught ones often pick things up much quicker, because they've taught themselves how to learn new things quickly and efficiently.\n\nTeaching yourself makes you figure stuff out on your own, which is an invaluable skill to have when programming. You can definitely go to college and be a fantastic programmer, but I've been seeing wave of self-taught people that seriously outpace all the college kids. Maybe I'm biased since I was also self-taught.\n\nEdit: with all that said... learn mathematics. Math will always be useful, especially if you want to target DeFi.",

If you convert to USDC or a stable coin you eliminate the possibility of your underlying asset appreciating in price and then solely rely on lending/staking APY.

The XLM is for the extremely low withdrawal fee.  I also only hold about $20 of BNB and KCS and use them strictly for paying lower fees.  Also even though there is a lot of selling, I rarely have any gains/losses by the time I get to UST because I buy and sell the XLM at the same limit price after transferring.  Just make sure you buy the XLM after the ACH waiting period so you can transfer it immediately, negating the volatility.",

                            "response": ">How do the projects without private sale & seed funding successfully create the liquidity pools though?\n\nYou go to an AMM protocol that supports your token standard and then seed the pool with your own funds. For example, if you want to pair your new ERC-20 token with wETH, you can create a factory on UniSwap and seed it with initial liquidity of token + wETH. UniSwap is one example - you can do this on virtually any platform that offers permissionless factory creation (Curve, Astroport)\n\n>Knowing that most DEXs operate following the a \\* b = k formula, how do new projects successfully create liquidity pools without significant funds.\n\nYou can seed the pool with a very tiny amount of money which I don't recommend because of MEV risks. See above answer re: seeding pools / factories.\n\n>If we have a new coin - ShitCoin and we want to create a ShitCoin / USDC LP for it. If with a total supply of 1,000,000 we dedicate 10% of ShitCoin into that pool (100k) and all we have left is 10,000 USDC, we end up with the following scenario:  \n>  \n>100,000 (a) \\* 10,000 (b) = 1,000,000 (k)\r  \n\r  \nObviously this scenario could result in high slippage due to a low amount of USDC. How do new projects without significant backing manage those situations?\n\nDepends on what the new project is doing. If they want to rug their participants, they distribute the SC to people and ask them to buy more via the SC / USDC pool using USDC. CPMMs rebalance and allocate USDC to LPs based on factory parameters and token values allowing extractable value from the pool in USDC up to a maximum extractable value.\n\nIf it's legitimate, then you are asking a much more nuanced question. The concept is to allow free market trading without exploitation of the pool. The token must have value. If user A buys SC with USDC, granting them 1,000 tokens, then the 1,000 tokens have to generate value that will increase the token value. Then, the purchaser may sell their token (exit) for profit, increasing the intrinsic value of the token in that time period assuming no other changes to the system.\n\nMaking a new token is basically developing a new digital-only product if it's legitimate. Without significant backing, the risk of a bot or user extracting legitimate value from the LP exists, meaning that the factory creators can't necessarily insure their purchasers from soft exploits as described.\n\n>What is the right strategy to have the right ratio in the pool to be successful for a new project?\n\nThis is a business question first. Deep liquidity offers low slippage and is generally less likely to be [MEV-exploited](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/mev/). We don't know what kind of business the asker is wanting to develop, so answers will be nebulous at best.\n\n>Lastly, when other people are incentivized to provide liquidity into the pool doesn\u2019t it have an impact on the k, which is supposed to remain constant? I\u2019m a bit confused about all those details.\n\nYes. Depositors create a price impact on the pool because it forces a rebalance on (*x, y*) values for *k*. The idea of *xy = k* as a constant is an invariant designed to generate predictable behaviors in a dynamic system. Depositing into a pool changes *k*, which was previously determined by every other previous LP in the form of (*x, y*). It doesn't mean that *k* is supposed to remain equivalent to its value previously, that is, changes in *k* as (*k1, k2*).\n\nIncentivizing liquidity deposits means deeper liquidity for lower slippage, creating an attractive AMM product. If there's no trade volume on a pool with deep liquidity, it's just idle money.",

Like, if you are subscribed to a group, and you have an immediate question, you can go there and ask and be pretty sure you're going to get a helpful answer. HOWEVER, as soon as you do, you will see all the scammers come out, and they are thick as thieves on Telegram. You have to be very diligent about your online security in these places and learn how to block them.  They usually have a pinned comment regarding current events, but the chat runs continuously and can be quite non productive. \n\ndiscords can be more organized, you can find specific threads of information if they have been setup and maintained, they have announcements, and pinned current info to quickly catch up on the latest, but its still not great.\n\nThis is the problem, there is not one place to get actionable info, its all over the place, and its a minefield of shills and scammers, one should spend A LOT of time reading and understanding the landscape before deciding to put ANY money down. These people understand the art of FOMO, they will make you feel like you have to get in now before its too late or you will miss the opportunity. Don't fall for it. If your getting that info from these places, it's already too late. Someone is running up the price so they can exit with your money.  This is truly wild west territory filled with many financial dangers designed to separate you from your money. The more smiley, and kind, and helpful, they are, the more skeptical you should be of any \"opportunity.\"  Good luck.",

Thats not just borrowing anymore, that turns it into leverage.\n\nI keep my LTV for btc/eth at 80%, to answer succinctly, but thats because I can pay it back in 1 minute's notice and have a contract set up to sell very small amounts of my collateral to repay the loans in case of an overnight crash. YMMV, but if using the loan for an illuquid asset, an 80% LTV is pretty much gauranteed liquidation.",

Your scenario is different than people borrowing but keeping it all in crypto so they can just sell what they bought pretty easily and repay the loan.\n\nOn the flipside, I feel like getting a traditional loan to buy a house is Plan A.  Plan B is selling your WBTC to buy a house.  Plan C is borrowing against your house to buy a house.  Even if you did get liquidated, it's kinda like you just transitioned from plan C to plan B so it might suck that you take a 5 to 10 % penalty but it's kinda *who cares*?\n\n40% is pretty safe though.

With DeFi you should at least be able to follow through the maths in a whitepaper and check onchain activity to determine where the value is coming from. This lets you know if assets are being loaned out, or if an inflationary token is being used to support it or whatever. You've at least got a chance to tell if a protocol is sustainable or not.\n\nWith a centralized platform like an exchange you've basically got no way to know other than what they decide to tell you. CdC are probably not doing anything particularly scammy, but the fact that you can't verify that and just have to trust them should feel a bit outdated compared to using DeFi platforms.\n\nIf you keep considering questions like this before using platforms then I think you're likely to avoid some of the tempting traps that naive investors fall for in crypto.",

They estimate that insurance companies lose like 30% of their revenue due to bureaucracy. Smart contracts = unprecedented capital efficiency.\n2. Higher demand for stablecoin loans: Non-pegged crypto (BTC, ETH) is, as we all know, volatile. Volatile currencies are less suitable for exchange and harder to collateralize via a smart contract, so stablecoins are preferable. Imagine you take out a loan that is worth $50,000 one day and $30,000 two weeks from then? Not great.\n\nEssentially, stablecoins offer the same benefits of non-pegged crypto and fiat (gov currency) to create the most easily exchangeable (small purchases to large loans) currency.\n\nThis is why on custodial (BlockFi, Celsius) and non-custodial (Gelt Finance) you can earn a lot with stablecoins.",

There's a bit more to it when you start to look at the tokenomics behind AMMs and LPs but it's just what happens when a system is fair and everybody gets their fair share. That is why I am a huge proponent of decentralization of all things. It's just better. Also depending on the tokenomics some models are in fact sustainable long term. This is due to loans being overlevereged, the mint and burn mechanism, and liquidity pools. Not too knowledgeable on all of it but that's what I picked up so far.",

                    "response": "What backs a currency? USD, for example. Simple: faith. Currencies are not backed by metals anymore. If there is a lot of faith on some currency then its investors will believe (faith again) on the ability of central bank to honor its debts (aka bonds), so they'll ask for lower interests since the risk is supposed to be low.\n\nBut if we are talking about the Russian Ruble, for example, the investors will ask for higher interests. There is no guarantee that Russian central bank will be able to honor its debts, mainly outside the Swift.\n\nI believe that the main reason is that while many stablecoins guarantees that they are pegged 1:1 with some currency, we can never know for sure and there can be a huge risk here. Other explanation is that the demand for stablecoins are much higher than supply. Actually, it's huge. Many companies are already using USDC instead of USD or EURX instead of EURO. \n\nMy point is: embrace DeFi now.",

The borrow APR is 0%, but there is a repayment fee of 0.5%, which is amazing if you plan to keep it there for a while. You can only borrow their own stablecoin called MAI though, but it seems to be pretty well used on many different DEXs. You can also convert the MAI to any other coin (stable or otherwise) to farm or stake to your own liking.\n\nAnother benefit is that they incentivise borrowing by paying a certain percentage APR relative to your loan. So if you deposit say $1000 worth of wBTC and borrow $500 worth of MAI (collateral ratio ~50%) you will earn around 12% per annum in Qi (the platform's own token) paid out every week. These percentages change based on votes by the DAO, so some weeks I earn a lot less Qi because the DAO chose to incentivise borrowing against other coins than my own.\n\nThe platform is much smaller than Aave and probably has a higher chance of hacks or exploits, but to me the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nNot financial advice btw!",

In my experience working with investors, most of them don't really care about working with the DeFi backbone - if they give me money, they just want a return. (which I personally kind of hate, but that's my job, so I guess it's hard to complain.)\n\n>What if there were simple & secure Defi rest APIs that dealt with all the complexities behind the scenes, and allowed neobanks, institutional funds, and fintech apps to provide their customers exposure to Defi? Wouldn't this prevent their customers from moving away to crypto banks (like Celsius) or even self-managed wallets?\n\nThis is exactly what I've been curious about lately. It is important to give customers accessibility to work with DeFi itself - Web3 wallets exist, hardware wallets exist, and it's possible to integrate both. Then, people can work with the protocols themselves.\n\nI am highly in pivoting to a neobank-type model for my business. It simply makes more sense for what I'm doing. However, the biggest hurdle I've been hitting is that there are no simple ways to introduce this to clients and investors.\n\nFor example, as a roleplay client:\n\n* If I want to invest in cryptocurrency without doing it myself, what are the best options?\n   * Option A : Exchanges (which take a huge % of commission - e.g. Coinbase takes 20% on ATOM, and Kraken takes 100%, purely for liquidity purposes, resulting in 5% - 10% lower APY)\n   * Option B : talk to someone who knows something about DeFi and invest with them as a broker-service.\n* If I go with Option B, how do I go through a redemption? (this is a huge pain in the ass for both of us)\n\n>The idea seems too obvious. Do you folks know of any obvious market risks? Have there been any past attempts?\n\nMarket risks are all protocol-related in this regard, given that your question is abstracting complexity away from customers to interact with DeFi. I don't actually think there is a need to give customers this functionality *unless* they want a neo-brokerage service (such as Fidelity for regular clients). It's more efficient to use DeFi directly.\n\nThere is also the obvious one regarding compliance and how an entity operates in the space which is why I'm very interested in this - there are a lot of directions to take, it's a matter of deciding which one.",

The use case is for those that like the idea of single staking their stable coins at a high % without having to convert it to UST or bridge over to Terra. \n\nA thing to note is that the UST deposit % will be dropping slowly in the near future and Orion's rates will therefore be dropping as well. \n\nPersonally, as a staker and holder of Luna for longer than most, I don't really have a positive look on the protocol as they leverage the Anchor APR without allowing it to have it's intended effect(spread UST adoption). They also bribe people to stake with their validator with Orion tokens, which has allowed them to be the largest delegated validator even though they don't provide any benefit to Terra and are essentially leaches.

Maybe it\u2019s actually harder to keep a big coin stable because you need more money to do it. I\u2019m not saying this is the case, but being big is not directly linked with being safe.",

Large liquidity outside the terra ecosystem as well as nearly half of Luna locked in staking for 21 days is what will absorb the initial impact.  After that, arbitrageurs will come in to play when the price action slows down.  Continuous exit pressure from the terra ecosystem is less likely as UST expands further outside its own ecosystem.  Btc reserves are not yet fully implemented but getting that in place will provide another cushion for the fall.  All these intermediate steps break the downward momentum that is apparent in all death spirals.\n\nEdit: I sleep with staked luna",

The latter will pay you a %, but instead of these being denominated in the token you deposited, it will be specific to that pool. For example, there\u2019s a Lido pool that pays tAPR in LDO tokens, and Curve adds to this with CRV awards. In that case, you would earn some [usually lower] % paid in the form of the tokens deposited, and in addition another % [usually higher] paid in the form of LDO and CRV\n\nThe catch? The tAPR requires you to deposit AND stake in the gauge. Staking in gauge can be skipped and you can stake other places [convex being my personal choice] and earn other tokens instead of CRV and LDO. In addition, the tAPR is generally a range, say 2.1% \u2014 14.5% [made up figures] and the way you get the higher range is to vote lock or vote escrow CRV tokens and then vote for your pool to receive emissions.  Vote Escrowed CRV becomes basically out of touch and most gauges won\u2019t be affected by small lungs of veCRV, as larger teams / protocols / criminals dominate the CRV gauges [FRAX and UST via Convex, to be precise], making it generally better to deposit on curve and then stake the LP token on convex. \n\nAll that said, convex has some pretty good rates on staked stables. \n\nSurprisingly, Balancer will show some good % on stables here and there, honestly though I haven\u2019t checked it recently.",

There is no location that can burn down, no company going out of business, which would stop you accessing your funds. The two risks are exploits of the smart contract (such as flashloan attacks) and your carelessness. The former become less likely the longer a project has been running, as presumably possible hacks and exploit vectors would probably have been found after years of operation and huge numbers of users. \n\n\nIf you stick to big, well used platforms (like Curve, AAVE etc) then your actions represent almost your entire source of risk. Signing transactions you haven't checked, losing your private keys/seed phrase, using fake links, having your PC compromised, being fished, all of these are risks. Natural disasters and fires are only a danger if they occur in your home and destroy your only wallet access backups.",

Exchanges and the like operate as custodians of your funds, so stuff like cold storage applies to them, but DeFi is completely different.\n\nJust as an example take Maker. They are one of the biggest and oldest names in DeFi, allowing users to lock up ether to mint the DAI stablecoin. There is currently around $15 billion worth of value locked in the Maker smart contract ecosystem.\n\nThey have a nice front end that looks at first glance like any other website, it allows you to connect your wallet to the platform and interact with the smart contract, but when you do so you're not sending your ether to a company somewhere, you're just sending it to a contract running autonomously on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIf everyone involved in building Maker quit tomorrow, all their computers spontaneously caught fire, the United Nations blocked their website in every country on Earth, and aliens raided their offices to steal everything that survived the fires... you'll still be able to use Maker, set up new vaults, recover your ether etc. As long as Ethereum blocks are being produced somewhere Maker will exist. To access it you might need to interact with the contract directly (https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f8f72aa9304c8b593d555f12ef6589cc3a579a2#writeContract) until someone builds a new pretty front end for it, but the contracts will be useable.\n\nThere are some really fundamental differences between DeFi and what you're used to. I'm happy to continue this thread if you have questions, but to be honest I think your best bet is to put in a bit more reading and learning time to get to grips with the differences in risk and security with this kind of thing. DeFi is fantastic and I honestly believe it will replace the legacy financial world eventually, but you need to have a bit of understanding before jumping in with a significant investment.",

Couple of checks i personally perform before i APE-in:  \n\n\n1. check APY & TVL (for stables try to aim for 15%+, and at least >1m TVL)\n2. check APY stability, unless you want to actively manage on a daily basis\n3. explore risk and potential mitigants \n\nFor example how  i used this for evaluating Anchor:  \n\n\n1. Anchor boost great APY of 19,45%( [https://app.anchorprotocol.com/earn](https://app.anchorprotocol.com/earn)). TVL is in the billions - **so check**\n2. Anchor is well known for their APY stability (although this may decrease in the future due to semi-dynamic Earn rate - max -1.5% on a monthly basis but announced in advance) - **so check**\n3. Anchor uses the terra native stable coin: UST. There is some FUD about potential de-peg due to bank run/liquidity issues. Just this week another stablecoin USDN depeggged.  \nThere is a mitigant for de-peg risk >> UST-depeg insurance -  which costs around 1.85% annually (fluctuates a bit check here: [https://app.brightunion.io/coverages?coverable=UST%20De-Peg](https://app.brightunion.io/coverages?coverable=UST%20De-Peg)), **leaving a 17.60% de-risked APY - still above 15% so check**\n\n  \nBased on the above i have happily put a significant chunk of my DeFi yield portfolio into Anchor (dont forget to diversify kids..)",

From what you're saying you've got an earning issue and if you don't rectify that any issues come up and then you'll be liquidating the little bit you have in crypto and constantly trying to chase yield to make up for the lack of capital invested.",

I was trying to make a long explanatory post but there is just too much stuff and I only now realize how complex this world can be. So I'll just write down a few things that you should keep in mind and take my word for it while you do your own research because explaining them would took too long. Just take them as safety advices and keep in mind that none of what you hear from me, or from I guess everyone around here, is financial advice. As I am not trained for it and am self-tutored etc etc etc.\n\n  \nFirst off NO. Crypto is not a free ticket to money. 99% of people who jump into crypto lose a shitton before actually starting to earn something. Sure, there's tokens that go 100x and can make you 100$ in 10k, but, as someone said earlier, it's a lottery ticket and it will not happen overnight.  \n\n\nI got into crypto last october after losing my job (but with about 5k$ of cash) hoping to be able to make a living out of this world. Then november and then january crash happened and i ended up down abou 80% of my initial investments. Then I slowly began to learn and now I managed to get back to about -50% in a couple of months. Which is actually impressive, but unfortunately, thinking of doubling your capital every month is delusional. It can happen, but it's very more likely that you will just lose it all.\n\nIt's all about risk-reward. You have 100k$ to invest? You can easily get 20% yearly (which is about a low salary in europe) with very little risk.\n\nAre you trying to turn 100$ in 1000$ in a month? It's possible but it's WAY more likely to turn them into 10$ than into a thousand, especially when everything is new. (personal experience)\n\nI think that the best (if not the only) way to learn how to invest in crypto is having a stable income and dedicating a small % of it each month to crypto. I got rekt financially and emotionally after losing my job and thinking I was better than others to move in this world and I would not advise others to do the same. Though I entered this market right before btc started crashing down while now it's looking way more healthy.  \n\n\nLook up videos on youtube from Coin Bureau he's a great Guy. \n\nWish you the best of luck and stay safe",

Put ONLY WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE, and i mean lose it all, and try testing with it. If you can make some money then you can compound the profits and just make experience.Also patience is key. When you are new to something you just want to keep buying and selling and you check the price 50 times a day but sometimes it'd be better to just leave it be an work on higher time frames.\n\nWhatever you do I'd say play it small for at least a month and gradually increase your investments when you see you can pull it off.   \n\n\nThere's also some cool discord groups you can join and you'll find literally some of the best communities of the web. Not sure if r/defi has also a discord tbh",

I honestly often dont even care what the price of BTC is. Im just making money.\n\nThere are hundreds of plays you can play, depending on your risk tolerance and overall outlook.",

So you're effectively getting a nice return on your main coin.\n\nExample:\n\nSupply $100 in Bitcoin, borrow $50 in ShitCoinXYZ. Then farm with ShitCoinXYZ at 50%. You're effectively earning 25% on your Bitcoin there and you have no effective exposure to ShitCoinXYZ. Whether the price goes up or down, you're just going to pay back the loan with it.",

Get interest on stablecoins - but what if it\u2019s not enough? Well then, get a loan collateralized by the receipt token, then use the borrowed asset to make more money. Perhaps by depositing the borrowed asset back into the mechanism that produced the collateral of the loan (\u201clooping\u201d, see Abracadabra docs for a visual explanation).\n2) Perhaps you\u2019re long on an asset like Ethereum or Luna. You can find different places to gain yield on it. One of your options is to use your asset as collateral to loan out stablecoins, then use those stablecoins to get more money.",

Made really handsome profits. I never expected Shiba to explode the way it did last year. I expected either a 10X at most, OR the coin dumping to zero in a worst case scenario. In preparing for a worst case scenario, I ''invested/gambled'' ''pocket change'' into Shiba.\n\nThat was a one off. Currently hold no memecoins. I usually do thorough research into projects before buying their coins. Have a bunch of projects nowadays in my portfolio, such as Matic, Avax, Lox, Dot to mention a few.\n\nAt the end of the day though, it's up to everyone to make choices about what they think is best for them.",

If you tried to work on your taxes in good faith, they are lenient in their dealings. What they don't like is people hiding shit. If they found that out, that is when shit hits the fan. If you do get audited, the worst that can happen is they go through a few years of your returns, I think 7 is the max. Just keep your records straight, send them what they request, wait for the result, settle up if they found some discrepancies. They're going to hit you with some penalties if you owe something. The price of paying them late in their eyes.  \n\nDepending on the amount of trades, some app will be better than others. Koinly is highly recommended here, I compared 3 myself and found Koinly to be the best of them. I suggest trying out a few too to see which one works for you. Bonus is the practice will give you an idea if your are doing it right. If they are all showing the same thing or close enough, you know you are on the right track.  \n\nHopefully you've done your taxes before, if not, once again, try different software to see which you like better and to make sure you aren't making any mistakes. Turbo tax is user friendly but I usually get less refund than other solutions.  \nGoodluck man.",

OP conveniently forgets the events of black thursday or w/e it was called when $DAI collapsed and needed to be bailed out via emergency $MAKER auction\n\nDAI was pretty young at that time, and they were able to get it to recover pretty quickly. I remember seeing my UST holdings last March iirc go down to $0.94 and some hedge fund or something bailing UST out. Both DAI and UST have added additional mechanisms to bolster their pegs since both of their run on the pegs. DAI is definitely a lot more battle tested than UST though.\n\n>$DAI is a wrapper for $USDC now, the project completely lost its trajectory and original mission - it's not even pretending to be decentralized anymore\n\nAround 60% according to your image linked above. I agree that it is too much, but it also isn't all that it is.\n\n> it cannot scale, much like many collateralized assets\n\nIn what respect can't it scale?

I remember seeing my UST holdings last March iirc go down to $0.94 and some hedge fund or something bailing UST out. Both DAI and UST have added additional mechanisms to bolster their pegs since both of their run on the pegs. DAI is definitely a lot more battle tested than UST though.\n\nNo, $UST reclaimed its peg automatically - it didn't need a bailout. Unless you have a source to back up that claim?\n\n The goal of algorithmic stablecoins (well, the good ones at least) is not only to maintain but to REGAIN the peg through self sufficient methods - not through a direct monetary bailout when in trouble...\n\n> Around 60% according to your image linked above. I agree that it is too much, but it also isn't all that it is.\n\n$USDC is such a huge percentrage of collateral that it makes no sense to even hold $DAI over $USDC\n\n> In what respect can't it scale? Its market capitalization scaling, or tps?\n\nCollateralized assets need to constantly seek out new or additional collateral to meet market demand - if a 'decentralized' project needs to pump centralized backing to meet this demand, then what are we even talking about? It's a charade through and through - just get $USDC...",

I started in crypto last January had a big loss when the market dipped and without knowing of the game sold my coins at a loss a few days later it dipped even more I had the courage and bought back the coins (ETH) then I learned about solana and bought a decent number of coins. Now I am staking both ETH and SOL and I have also gotten into the DeFi, been reading and learning so much and know I still got a lot more to learn. One thing is for sure, I\u2019m not longer afraid of crypto IDMOR and go for what I believe in along with some diversification. Mining crypto is something I want to learn about to see if it is financially worth we might go for solar energy and have some space in the basement so there is that possibility if not, I\u2019m still happy with my involvement in crypto, the best financial decision I\u2019ve ever made. Somebody said: the first best moment to get into crypto was when it first started, the second best moment to get into crypto is NOW!",

I've worked in education for years and as someone who likes to develop curriculum, I set out to get an insight into what we should be teaching students based on what their world would look like. I started with next gen tech. I became quite excited by the coming satellite cell service and the government opening up more bandwidth and spectrum sharing...IoT. Then I found Blockchain. This blew my mind. I became obsessed. I did the Gensler MIT course and became certified through Duke University. Now I simply can't go back to education because it's too slow to adapt and too corrupt to change. So yeah, now I'm in it to replace my income but I love the tech and I'm fascinated by the privacy but mostly I'm excited by the efficiency and giving value back to the community. I just hope that it takes several decades before becoming the oppressive controlling system that history tells it will eventually become. I plan on fully enjoying the golden years of crypto.",

As for history repeating, I think that humans will continue to organize in groups and those groups can easily become centralized for good reasons but eventually, human nature will find a way to create hierarchies and greed for power is always at work. I can see the possibility of a more equitable world as human energy is transferred to machines.

I tend to prowl forums like Reddit and recently Twitter to see what people are saying. Then moving against the herd in some way.\n\n**Example 1**: Terra (LUNA) has been floating around $90 for a month now. It spiked a few days ago to $100+ when Do Kwon (founder) announced he'd be buying $1b in Bitcoin to act as reserves for Anchor - [this has been in discussion for longer than a few days](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1503296630396645376), which can be learned by interacting with networks. If you wanted that news, you'd follow him on Twitter, and if you wanted it sooner, you'd be on Anchor reading governance proposals and asking how 19.5% is sustainable and what people would do to keep it that way. If you go to [CMC's news page](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/news/), all reports are three days late, which means you, as an investor or trader relying on news, are three days late to a 2-week+ long discussion.\n\n**Example 2**: Crypto Twitter is flooding my timeline with talks of the Merge in Q2 causing price increase. Ethereum has increased in price, but the speed at which it increases won't hit maximum price until all of Ethereum is staked (we're rounding about 10% max supply right now). There are services like Lido which offer liquid-staked-ETH. Do you know the target price point for Ethereum down the road? One seed investor in Coinbase has been [touting $10k for a while now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo58qEoThSs) \\- but the velocity of money pushing Ethereum up is not necessarily linear until more Ethereum is staked.",

I recommend looking into the LHA address and Contract B addresses below.**\n\nThe public address for OP is [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4cc0b402732e73973187e24353815e126fa5af84). The only outgoing transactions (per-approval) that were made were to:\n\n* RenBridge (RenVM), for renBTC (mint + approval);\n* Paraswap v5: Augustus Swapper Mainnet, to exchange renBTC for wBTC;\n* Wrapped BTC (wBTC) contract approval;\n* zkSync wBTC deposit;\n\nThe last outgoing transaction was made \\~2 days ago from OP's address to [a Laundering Intermediary Address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb4942daa4af61eedf014e4955d697e070cdf7b7a) (LIA), or an address that was made for the specific purpose of diverting stolen funds through contracts while remaining pseudonymous and 'relatively unsuspect' (due to 'low balances' and 'few transactions').\n\nThe LIA withdrew the Ether in the quantity of \u039e0.061159733395561 ($208.10) and swapped the balance for Wrapped Ether (wETH) via UniSwap V3 and the MetaMask Swap Router, after approving the Curve Token Contract to 'wash' the tokens (which is all traceable, so ????)\n\nThe LIA sent a value of \u039e0.043 ($142.47) to another LIA (we'll denote it as LIA-2). The LIA-2 address is viewable [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xeba6726793e1356e7040bb544ec1d911191717a2).\n\n**The LIA-2 sent the funds to a potential** [**Laundering Hub Address**](https://etherscan.io/address/0x077d360f11d220e4d5d831430c81c26c9be7c4a4) **(LHA)**. The LHA has a nominal value of \\~$110.65k at-time-of-writing in ETH and an additional $5.59k in various tokens including, but not limited to, Tether USD, Chainlink, Wrapped Bitcoin, Ankr, USDC, and random non-value coins.\n\nThe LHA is where OP has tracked the money to. From here, anybody willing to investigate into this potential LHA should look at one or both of the following:\n\n* [Incoming Transaction Log](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x077d360f11d220e4d5d831430c81c26c9be7c4a4&f=3) \\- to view if funds were stolen from other addresses\n* [Outgoing Transaction Log](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x077d360f11d220e4d5d831430c81c26c9be7c4a4&f=2) \\- to view where the laundered funds are sent to\n\nYou will see the potential LHA has 2,000 pages of outgoings here. By sampling from the first ten pages, you can find several unique addresses and contracts that may be of use when investigating these types of fund thefts.\n\n* ENS addresses - [fooled.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b8de1551a96c67e5ba5eaafc41fbc8d87484e95), [bendreary.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3a2548af0f22204eec8da7b2d002f0b01f9cdab8), [4mradik.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb72a7e658a8a9a63e8b89b9bde8177a427aa6342), [astalil.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0ef955288ab7fe8e490800ad49858dbdb7c1e275), [ixpartay.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a3e14702ae60c8b7fc5957990518233ff752634), [ethereumte.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7462fd2fadb7f2850ce1a960e672adfb3e29877f), [buford.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x92fe601f2e42f80ec784a7e76b22201504d108bb)\n   * One common trend includes funneling money through OpenSea's Wyvern Exchange.\n* Various Non-ID'd Contract addresses - [Contract A](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd41d0a45672ee52656ebc191a26ae3088225e2c4), [Contract B](https://etherscan.io/address/0x763ec4e70882555c6f1bc1a5e769dc31d5fddfc3), [Contract C](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcbafde962280277e8cbd703aa42abf7eec2c2e42), [Contract D](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7bd6dc4266dc4ce74b6bb0e982ae4e006d17105d), [Contract E](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0a1820f0ff7dc9fce0a4f0b589ee14ddae88233c)\n   * Contract A sends money through Gemini Exchange contracts which doesn't allow viewability of private addresses.\n   * Contract B sends money to a non-ID contract which creates Forwarder addresses.\n      * A Forwarder address, in simple terms, means that whenever Ethereum is sent to the contract, it will send money via the Forwarder Contract to addresses outlined in the contract.\n      * The creator of this contract is [this address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbf0c5d82748ed81b5794e59055725579911e3e4e) which owns \\~$4.2m in ETH and >105 tokens (mostly Dai, Chainlink, UniSwap, USDT, USDC, Wirex Token, 1INCH, wBTC, and way more).\n      * The contract uses a functionality called Flush Forwarder Tokens which removes the ERC-20 tokens in a Forwarder contract. Basically, they're cashing out (mostly in Dai).\n   * Contract C is a non-ID contract that sends money over to Loopring.\n      * Decompiling the Contract Byte code was actually the first request of this. You can view the decompiled contract here by selecting \"[Decompile Bytecode](https://etherscan.io/bytecode-decompiler?a=0xcbafde962280277e8cbd703aa42abf7eec2c2e42).\"\n      * There are 21,796 EXACT matches of Bytecode with this specific Contract [viewable here](https://etherscan.io/find-similar-contracts?a=0xcbafde962280277e8cbd703aa42abf7eec2c2e42&lvl=5).\n      * The contract is actually very short and only uses storage + \\_fallback() payable functions.\n   * Contract D sends money to Contract B.\n      * Contract D also has not been decompiled before. [Viewable here](https://etherscan.io/bytecode-decompiler?a=0x7bd6dc4266dc4ce74b6bb0e982ae4e006d17105d).\n      * There is a larger subsample of Exact-Match Bytecode ([1,536,686 contracts](https://etherscan.io/find-similar-contracts?a=0x7bd6dc4266dc4ce74b6bb0e982ae4e006d17105d&lvl=5)).\n      * This contract calls to a parentAddress (which uses storage 0 reference) and then flushes the tokens with a \\_fallback() payable.\n   * Contract E has a different address creator, which was an interesting find as an address related to Contract B - [here's the address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x604df452158e7ddf3e44338308edc079a953c9da).\n      * The address routinely sends money to Forwarder Factories and the Contract B address using flushForwarderTokens() and creates Forwarder Contracts with 0 wei code viewable on the contract.\n      * Given its high amount of Ethereum relative to other tokens, it's possible this is the equivalent of a truck designed to move money from A (sending address) to C (contract address) acting as point B (gas middleman).\n      * [This contract is actually quite long](https://etherscan.io/bytecode-decompiler?a=0x0a1820f0ff7dc9fce0a4f0b589ee14ddae88233c). It's important to note that it still uses the same safeMode() and \\_fallback() payable functions.",

When you use \"DeFi\" contract, you need to know that they have been audited and have been used by others for months. If you don't take those precautions than you need to read the contract code yourself and make sure that you are not approving something that you don't understand.Edit: a cold storage won't help you if you approved a malicious contract to move your funds out of the cold storage wallet.",

That said, you state that the risk of defi farming is very low to none, which seems suspicious given my limited experience in defi and the general community sentiment.\n\nCan you comment on how you assess the defi farming risk to be that low? Are you think of specific approaches for the 18% APR you\u2019re assuming? What are they?\n\nAlso, is there an alternative model for btc price appreciation? I do like u/nested_dreams suggestion of logarithmic, which would show progressive reduction in rate of appreciation as adoption increases but still a reasonable increase in price versus time over the long term.",

I am using specific DeFi services for that, correct (can let you know more in PM), but I trust it, yes (and \"trust me\", I am the paranoid type. :) )\n\nYour point about a possible logarithmic appreciation is quite valid and indeed I must explore it. It's shameful how naive the current \"extrapolation\" is, but hey, some data is better than none.\n\nIn case more people are interested, I can try to construct a logarithmic one too (and also, more importantly, one which takes into account the halvings in 2024 and 2028 too).\n\nThank you for sharing your thoughts!",

I\u2019ve been paranoid and I\u2019ve been wrong, and I\u2019d rather be paranoid! \ud83d\ude1c\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not criticizing your choice of linear price appreciation, as it\u2019s better than no data at all as you suggest. I\u2019m quite impressed with your analysis as a whole and the nice thing is that you can modify the model as you see fit to assess the impact on results.\n\nRegarding the halvings, I have considered how to represent this before and I\u2019m just not sure. It almost always leads me to something that looks logarithmic though.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve come to is that there are competing effects\u2026namely the reduction in block reward driving scarcity of supply pitted against (assumed) ever-increasing institutional adoption. I think as the former progresses, it will drive demand up especially in light of the significant amount of institutional accumulation that has and will continue to happen. That said, with that accumulation, we could see a reduction in volatility due to the broader/mainstream market recognizing a more stable valuation versus fiat as compared to today\u2019s sentiment that crypto is still largely a speculative asset.\n\nI could go on and on, but I still don\u2019t think I know enough to know (nor does anyone, right?), so testing various approaches in your model may have the effect of bounding the cases in the very least and I believe that is still a valuable message to convey.\n\nLooking forward to your future work!",

                    "response": ">Has anyone succeeded long-term with \"Buy Low, Sell High\" (selling major All-Time-High points and rebuying the dips)? If so, with what part of your portfolio you do it (10-30-100%?).\n\nA common allocation to trading (whether short- or long-term) is generally 10% of the net value of your portfolio. In my fund, I use a flat amount. You can make money with any amount trading but you will see exponential returns with higher base capital amounts, naturally.\n\nLearning trading via market-making isn't cut-and-dry. Buy low and sell high requires the equivalence of securities analysis to do consistently - and consistency is reliant on your methodology. To answer your question, I have had more than several trades that have returned 2x+ and others that return less and some that are losses. Trading is a different discussion.\n\nI disagree with the other user about consistently profiting off trading. You have to do it a lot and be prepared to risk a lot of capital and understand that in long-form you're not profiting as much as if you would have held as-an-investment. The purpose of trading is to market-make for profit.\n\n>If you side with the \"HODL/Staking\" strategy, what are your arguments against \"leaving all that money\" on the table? If so, please elaborate (with personal experiences/math) beyond simply \"it's less risky\".\n\nYour example doesn't account for rate changes, for one. Secondly, most interest rates are calculated on the quantity of tokens owned and not the dollar value associated with it. For example, if you are lending Bitcoin at 18%, but you only have 1 Bitcoin, you're earning 18% on the quantity of 1 and not $45,000. It's only marginally better than keeping it liquid. I don't really need to tell you the math on this one.\n\nHowever, keeping the asset liquid is beneficial if you want to set a limit order *or* keep it ready to buy for opportunities. I can't tell you the amount of times I saw an opportunity to buy something and had to wait days for my lend-for-yield unlock. It's awful, and I often would miss the price buy-in.\n\nAll of this really depends on your temperament. I enjoy being active with my trades and investments, in a way, tinkering and refining the process. Not everyone likes this. (Contrary to your belief, you don't always have to tune into news or chart-watch or draw TA lines - in fact, I avoid nearly all of those and only use a few indicators to make a decent profit - it isn't the highest yield, but certainly a learning process.)\n\nConsider that you could, fundamentally speaking, earn a near-equivalent yield with two different strategies. You could do both but this requires more work and more capital...which is the point.\n\nAnyways, let me touch on your strategies briefly:\n\n>HODL with DeFi Interest/Staking\n\nAssuming you're diversifying strategies across holding (as-liquid) / LP-farms / staking-for-in-kind-interests:\n\n* Liquid capital doesn't earn but allows for opportunistic buys on-demand. If you have price targets you can lend for variable time-periods.\n* LP-farms with volatile assets subjects your portfolio to a degree of impermanent loss unless you develop a sophisticated near-delta-neutral strategy.\n* LP-farms yield consistent fees on certain protocols with high volumes and rates are variable.\n* Staking offsets dilution-of-assets related to inflationary protocols. For non-inflationary assets (e.g. Bitcoin), again, lending on the quantity of the asset needs to be mathematically weighted against lending against the dollar value of the asset. (e.g. what's more profitable - lending 1 BTC at 6% or 3 ETH at 6%?)\n\n>\"Buy Low, Sell High\"\n\nAssuming you're using multiple trading horizons from <1 year (short-term) to >1 year (long-term):\n\n* Even a decent strategy for short-term trading will outweigh fees - these ones are lower-risk. The best strategies are higher-risk and in both cases, risking a greater amount of capital yields more income.\n   * I recommend tracking profits based on principal capital, price of cost basis per-share, and theoretical gains per-share per-bps (basis point). There's actually some sweet spots for this - try running simulations on assets that are $0.10 vs. $1.00 for your base capital and then applying the volatility simulation (bps).\n   * Trading *takes practice*. I don't like the sentiment that trading isn't viable (especially without algobots) that proliferates on crypto subreddits. You have to be willing to put down $1k and watch it drop to $850 in a flash, maybe even $0. Yes, it sucks. Go again. Most people don't stick it out to this point and either quit or settle for algobots.\n* Another pro of trading *in tandem with investing* is that you can generate more capital because you are doing more work (by market-making). You can therefore create a more robust portfolio this way.\n* A recession is the *best* opportunity to repurchase into the market and effectively buttress it. That is why you have liquidity on-hand even if \"it doesn't make anything.\"\n   * This also applies to your comments about inflation. Over sustained periods of time, yes, your cash is going to lose purchasing value, but it's a complex topic; is the increase of goods and services you purchase affecting your cashflow? To give you an example - Warren Buffett is notoriously very minimalistic in lifestyle (as are many other wealthy individuals). If \"losing purchasing power\" means \"cannot go out to eat every weekend\" then it may be, personally, for you, for the better.\n* The USDT risk is nonsense, personally, and if you're that worried about USDT go drop your money in Anchor and call it a day. Don't like that? USDC is reputable, and so is Dai.",

The XLM is for the extremely low withdrawal fee.  I also only hold about $20 of BNB and KCS and use them strictly for paying lower fees.  Also even though there is a lot of selling, I rarely have any gains/losses by the time I get to UST because I buy and sell the XLM at the same limit price after transferring.  Just make sure you buy the XLM after the ACH waiting period so you can transfer it immediately, negating the volatility.",

In my experience working with investors, most of them don't really care about working with the DeFi backbone - if they give me money, they just want a return. (which I personally kind of hate, but that's my job, so I guess it's hard to complain.)\n\n>What if there were simple & secure Defi rest APIs that dealt with all the complexities behind the scenes, and allowed neobanks, institutional funds, and fintech apps to provide their customers exposure to Defi? Wouldn't this prevent their customers from moving away to crypto banks (like Celsius) or even self-managed wallets?\n\nThis is exactly what I've been curious about lately. It is important to give customers accessibility to work with DeFi itself - Web3 wallets exist, hardware wallets exist, and it's possible to integrate both. Then, people can work with the protocols themselves.\n\nI am highly in pivoting to a neobank-type model for my business. It simply makes more sense for what I'm doing. However, the biggest hurdle I've been hitting is that there are no simple ways to introduce this to clients and investors.\n\nFor example, as a roleplay client:\n\n* If I want to invest in cryptocurrency without doing it myself, what are the best options?\n   * Option A : Exchanges (which take a huge % of commission - e.g. Coinbase takes 20% on ATOM, and Kraken takes 100%, purely for liquidity purposes, resulting in 5% - 10% lower APY)\n   * Option B : talk to someone who knows something about DeFi and invest with them as a broker-service.\n* If I go with Option B, how do I go through a redemption? (this is a huge pain in the ass for both of us)\n\n>The idea seems too obvious. Do you folks know of any obvious market risks? Have there been any past attempts?\n\nMarket risks are all protocol-related in this regard, given that your question is abstracting complexity away from customers to interact with DeFi. I don't actually think there is a need to give customers this functionality *unless* they want a neo-brokerage service (such as Fidelity for regular clients). It's more efficient to use DeFi directly.\n\nThere is also the obvious one regarding compliance and how an entity operates in the space which is why I'm very interested in this - there are a lot of directions to take, it's a matter of deciding which one.",

The borrow APR is 0%, but there is a repayment fee of 0.5%, which is amazing if you plan to keep it there for a while. You can only borrow their own stablecoin called MAI though, but it seems to be pretty well used on many different DEXs. You can also convert the MAI to any other coin (stable or otherwise) to farm or stake to your own liking.\n\nAnother benefit is that they incentivise borrowing by paying a certain percentage APR relative to your loan. So if you deposit say $1000 worth of wBTC and borrow $500 worth of MAI (collateral ratio ~50%) you will earn around 12% per annum in Qi (the platform's own token) paid out every week. These percentages change based on votes by the DAO, so some weeks I earn a lot less Qi because the DAO chose to incentivise borrowing against other coins than my own.\n\nThe platform is much smaller than Aave and probably has a higher chance of hacks or exploits, but to me the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nNot financial advice btw!",

It would be nice to pay the lowest rate on borrowed stable.\n3. This is something I thought about :) I was looking at borrowable tokens on AAVE to see which one has a high possibility to depreciate against fiat, but you can not be sure about any of them. But, yes good idea and maybe a reason to go with not so reputable platform like u/dyingflutchman suggested having debt in tokens that have a higher chance to flop :)\n4. Yes, it is. But BTCB is very transparent which I find attractive.\n5. It is around 2,5% per year on amount, 100 ETH assets = 2,5 ETH in insurance. It can be worth it if they really pay on a claim.\n6. Maybe, but I do not trust Nexo, BlockFi, or Celsius. Very aggressive marketing and rates, and only a small amount of assets are insured if I understand.\n\nThank you for your remarks.",

The use case is for those that like the idea of single staking their stable coins at a high % without having to convert it to UST or bridge over to Terra. \n\nA thing to note is that the UST deposit % will be dropping slowly in the near future and Orion's rates will therefore be dropping as well. \n\nPersonally, as a staker and holder of Luna for longer than most, I don't really have a positive look on the protocol as they leverage the Anchor APR without allowing it to have it's intended effect(spread UST adoption). They also bribe people to stake with their validator with Orion tokens, which has allowed them to be the largest delegated validator even though they don't provide any benefit to Terra and are essentially leaches. That's just my opinion though.",

I recommend looking into the LHA address and Contract B addresses below.**\n\nThe public address for OP is [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4cc0b402732e73973187e24353815e126fa5af84). The only outgoing transactions (per-approval) that were made were to:\n\n* RenBridge (RenVM), for renBTC (mint + approval);\n* Paraswap v5: Augustus Swapper Mainnet, to exchange renBTC for wBTC;\n* Wrapped BTC (wBTC) contract approval;\n* zkSync wBTC deposit;\n\nThe last outgoing transaction was made \\~2 days ago from OP's address to [a Laundering Intermediary Address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb4942daa4af61eedf014e4955d697e070cdf7b7a) (LIA), or an address that was made for the specific purpose of diverting stolen funds through contracts while remaining pseudonymous and 'relatively unsuspect' (due to 'low balances' and 'few transactions').\n\nThe LIA withdrew the Ether in the quantity of \u039e0.061159733395561 ($208.10) and swapped the balance for Wrapped Ether (wETH) via UniSwap V3 and the MetaMask Swap Router, after approving the Curve Token Contract to 'wash' the tokens (which is all traceable, so ????)\n\nThe LIA sent a value of \u039e0.043 ($142.47) to another LIA (we'll denote it as LIA-2). The LIA-2 address is viewable [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xeba6726793e1356e7040bb544ec1d911191717a2).\n\n**The LIA-2 sent the funds to a potential** [**Laundering Hub Address**](https://etherscan.io/address/0x077d360f11d220e4d5d831430c81c26c9be7c4a4) **(LHA)**. The LHA has a nominal value of \\~$110.65k at-time-of-writing in ETH and an additional $5.59k in various tokens including, but not limited to, Tether USD, Chainlink, Wrapped Bitcoin, Ankr, USDC, and random non-value coins.\n\nThe LHA is where OP has tracked the money to. From here, anybody willing to investigate into this potential LHA should look at one or both of the following:\n\n* [Incoming Transaction Log](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x077d360f11d220e4d5d831430c81c26c9be7c4a4&f=3) \\- to view if funds were stolen from other addresses\n* [Outgoing Transaction Log](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x077d360f11d220e4d5d831430c81c26c9be7c4a4&f=2) \\- to view where the laundered funds are sent to\n\nYou will see the potential LHA has 2,000 pages of outgoings here. By sampling from the first ten pages, you can find several unique addresses and contracts that may be of use when investigating these types of fund thefts.\n\n* ENS addresses - [fooled.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b8de1551a96c67e5ba5eaafc41fbc8d87484e95), [bendreary.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3a2548af0f22204eec8da7b2d002f0b01f9cdab8), [4mradik.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb72a7e658a8a9a63e8b89b9bde8177a427aa6342), [astalil.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0ef955288ab7fe8e490800ad49858dbdb7c1e275), [ixpartay.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a3e14702ae60c8b7fc5957990518233ff752634), [ethereumte.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7462fd2fadb7f2850ce1a960e672adfb3e29877f), [buford.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x92fe601f2e42f80ec784a7e76b22201504d108bb)\n   * One common trend includes funneling money through OpenSea's Wyvern Exchange.\n* Various Non-ID'd Contract addresses - [Contract A](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd41d0a45672ee52656ebc191a26ae3088225e2c4), [Contract B](https://etherscan.io/address/0x763ec4e70882555c6f1bc1a5e769dc31d5fddfc3), [Contract C](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcbafde962280277e8cbd703aa42abf7eec2c2e42), [Contract D](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7bd6dc4266dc4ce74b6bb0e982ae4e006d17105d), [Contract E](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0a1820f0ff7dc9fce0a4f0b589ee14ddae88233c)\n   * Contract A sends money through Gemini Exchange contracts which doesn't allow viewability of private addresses.\n   * Contract B sends money to a non-ID contract which creates Forwarder addresses.\n      * A Forwarder address, in simple terms, means that whenever Ethereum is sent to the contract, it will send money via the Forwarder Contract to addresses outlined in the contract.\n      * The creator of this contract is [this address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbf0c5d82748ed81b5794e59055725579911e3e4e) which owns \\~$4.2m in ETH and >105 tokens (mostly Dai, Chainlink, UniSwap, USDT, USDC, Wirex Token, 1INCH, wBTC, and way more).\n      * The contract uses a functionality called Flush Forwarder Tokens which removes the ERC-20 tokens in a Forwarder contract. Basically, they're cashing out (mostly in Dai).\n   * Contract C is a non-ID contract that sends money over to Loopring.\n      * Decompiling the Contract Byte code was actually the first request of this. You can view the decompiled contract here by selecting \"[Decompile Bytecode](https://etherscan.io/bytecode-decompiler?a=0xcbafde962280277e8cbd703aa42abf7eec2c2e42).\"\n      * There are 21,796 EXACT matches of Bytecode with this specific Contract [viewable here](https://etherscan.io/find-similar-contracts?a=0xcbafde962280277e8cbd703aa42abf7eec2c2e42&lvl=5).\n      * The contract is actually very short and only uses storage + \\_fallback() payable functions.\n   * Contract D sends money to Contract B.\n      * Contract D also has not been decompiled before. [Viewable here](https://etherscan.io/bytecode-decompiler?a=0x7bd6dc4266dc4ce74b6bb0e982ae4e006d17105d).\n      * There is a larger subsample of Exact-Match Bytecode ([1,536,686 contracts](https://etherscan.io/find-similar-contracts?a=0x7bd6dc4266dc4ce74b6bb0e982ae4e006d17105d&lvl=5)).\n      * This contract calls to a parentAddress (which uses storage 0 reference) and then flushes the tokens with a \\_fallback() payable.\n   * Contract E has a different address creator, which was an interesting find as an address related to Contract B - [here's the address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x604df452158e7ddf3e44338308edc079a953c9da).\n      * The address routinely sends money to Forwarder Factories and the Contract B address using flushForwarderTokens() and creates Forwarder Contracts with 0 wei code viewable on the contract.\n      * Given its high amount of Ethereum relative to other tokens, it's possible this is the equivalent of a truck designed to move money from A (sending address) to C (contract address) acting as point B (gas middleman).\n      * [This contract is actually quite long](https://etherscan.io/bytecode-decompiler?a=0x0a1820f0ff7dc9fce0a4f0b589ee14ddae88233c). It's important to note that it still uses the same safeMode() and \\_fallback() payable functions.",

When you use \"DeFi\" contract, you need to know that they have been audited and have been used by others for months. If you don't take those precautions than you need to read the contract code yourself and make sure that you are not approving something that you don't understand.Edit: a cold storage won't help you if you approved a malicious contract to move your funds out of the cold storage wallet.",

Are you think of specific approaches for the 18% APR you\u2019re assuming? What are they?\n\nAlso, is there an alternative model for btc price appreciation?

It's shameful how naive the current \"extrapolation\" is, but hey, some data is better than none.\n\nIn case more people are interested, I can try to construct a logarithmic one too (and also, more importantly, one which takes into account the halvings in 2024 and 2028 too).\n\nThank you for sharing your thoughts!",

I\u2019m quite impressed with your analysis as a whole and the nice thing is that you can modify the model as you see fit to assess the impact on results.\n\nRegarding the halvings, I have considered how to represent this before and I\u2019m just not sure. It almost always leads me to something that looks logarithmic though.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve come to is that there are competing effects\u2026namely the reduction in block reward driving scarcity of supply pitted against (assumed) ever-increasing institutional adoption. I think as the former progresses, it will drive demand up especially in light of the significant amount of institutional accumulation that has and will continue to happen. That said, with that accumulation, we could see a reduction in volatility due to the broader/mainstream market recognizing a more stable valuation versus fiat as compared to today\u2019s sentiment that crypto is still largely a speculative asset.\n\nI could go on and on, but I still don\u2019t think I know enough to know (nor does anyone, right?), so testing various approaches in your model may have the effect of bounding the cases in the very least and I believe that is still a valuable message to convey.\n\nLooking forward to your future work!",

Probably just approvals, contract signing, etc.  Not sure.\n\n2) amount in or 3) amount out but none that are a typical transaction like trade, transfer, buy, sell, stake, interest, mining, etc.\n\nI still need to go through and look for swaps I suppose.

Also, you earn the same coin that you deposit... deposit usdc earn usdc and it isn't effected by what other people deposit (no pool dilution).\nSo, how can they offer these rates, well it's all to do with their clever mechanics/tokenomics and how they Incentivize borrowers through giving rewards after they successfully repay their debt.\n\nEasy to use UI and available on Fantom FTM blockchain so transactions are cheap and fast.\n\nThere is also, $GEIST $SCREAM $TAROT which all offer similar things and are worth comparing.",

Yes, I like one project over another and that's because the one provided better ROI than the other one. I have invested and created nodes in at least 30 projects. So that's why I have an investor's point of view. It is hard to be excited about a project when you invested $1000 and you are getting $1.50 per day in rewards, and the opposite is also true when you invest $1000 and get $30 per day in rewards. Which project you would be excited about and try to really dissect the path they took. This is my take and I will be making a video discussing all of these points.

Can you elaborate on how the NFT Marketplace DeFi projects work? Is it that the investor are investing into the marketplace not through the NFTs themselves, but the tokens from the marketplace in which they stake and earn APY, and the marketplace generate returns through the NFT transaction fees themselves? And if so, where does the real incentive lie - in buying the marketplace tokens, or transacting NFTs on this marketplace? (The latter would make more sense for project longevity, no?)",

So the way I believe Alpha Nodes marketplace will work is that it will list the NFTs using the Alpha coins as a currency (similar to ETH) and as usual 10%-20% of the listing price usually is collected by the Marketplace when buy/sell takes place. I am not sure if the Alpha will be burned right away or collected in separate account and burned once a week, something that UNIV has been doing. Also people inherently love trading and that's why just collecting fees from Alpha NFTs can bring initial revenues, this wont last too long probably 2-3weeks before the volume will start to dwindle and then probably it will be up to the Alpha team to promote their marketplace to invite new projects similar to what LOOKS did. Again at this point I can only speculate exactly how Alpha will work. Also I dont think there will be staking, probably it will be more of a node type of project when you forever give up your ALpha tokens and given Node/NFT that will yield daily rewards.",

So for instance I bought a token at $5, then I will sell 25% at $10, next 25% at $20 and next 25% at $40, this way I make multiples of my initial but I derisk myself very early in this trade. The last 25% i use to create nodes, because we might have another 5x there but not from price appreciation but from rewards collection over a long period of time. Hope this helped",

We may see some idle funds yield farming if it is in highly liquid investments, similar to money market funds. However, large corporations are typically risk averse and focus more on preservation of capital than earning a return on it. Catch my drift? We'll get there eventually, but insurance needs to grow massively, and the overall safety of DeFi needs to improve for these large caps to get involved.",

It was later that I realized that the discord is where the real party is. They even have an academy there where noobs learn basic stuff. \n\nIt was there I eventually got to learn some fantastic stuff about DeFi in general.

I dont want to roast you but to educate new users and let them know that they should not do that unless they understand the risks.\n\nTLDR: no diversification, no risk management, including a ponzish project, not sustainable.\n\nFirst of all, you should not think you have learned everything in just 3 month. It is a very short timespan, and clearly you are still lacking experience. Yes it may be working right now but this is a recipe for disaster. I mean, if you are aware that what you are doing is gambling then it is all fine but you are presenting it like a solid investment. \n\nSecond the DOs and DON'Ts are correct i am not arguing about that, but it doesnt require a Genius to know that \"you should buy low and sell High\" or \"do not FOMO in\". I mean, duh? \nIf the purpose of this post was to get advice from more experienced users about your strategy okay, but you are suggesting this crap to new users who doesnt know anything about defi and can't the real risk of what they are doing.\n\nOf course i will explain why in my opinion this is not a good strategy. Then you can do what you want with it. \n\nFirst, you made and example with 100k but you never say what is your total net worth in this example: if you are a millionaire then putting 100k in this strategy is completely fine. I wouldnt do that but if you lose it all you can just move on. On the other hand if those 100k are all your money, well you are risking way to much. \nYou understand that 90% of your asset is on Anchor, which is a new protocol on the almost 1y old Terra blockchain. This is so risky, from UST depeg to hacks. \nBut lets imagine this will never happen, Anchor is relying on TFL money to give its 20% APY. Nobody knows how much it will last and what the % will be when it will be self sustainable. \n\nI was pretty excited about YieldNodes, i really like ponzi schemes. They are the best way to make money (if you create them of course). But hey i think that betting 10k in a casino is way funnier and you get free drinks too!\n\nThe fun part is that you put 200$ in \"degen plays\" without realizing that this whole strategy is a degen play.\n\nI can go on, but its getting too long. If you have any questions feel free to ask. And of course you are free to do whatever you like, just be aware that you are risking a lot by doing this and even if the best case scenario it wont last for long. \n\nIMHO if you had 100k to invest in defi you should put at least 20% in a stablecoin pool (USDC-BUSD for example). Another 20k in stable-crypto pool (ETH-USDC)\nDo not you just one protocol, say you put 10k on curve, 10k on aave, 10k on compound, etc.\nThen you can deposit a good chunk (like 30%? depends on your risk profile) in anchor and/or cefi to get higher rates. \nNow you can use those 15k left for various LP, if you really like degen plays 5k should do. You can't really invest in microcap with 200$.\n\nThats it.",

It's interesting to read what you wrote just couple of months ago. Eg. in Nov I was super bullish on TIME/MEMO, for the same reason everyone was. Now just 3 months later, I can see what a scam that guy was pulling off and I had suspended my reasoning in favor of FOMO.

But, I didn't realize, there are many nuances to what \"being early\" really means.   \n\nI didn't realize at first that there are people who are given private access to project resources earlier than I am.  I initially thought project launch means, they turn it on and everyone has an equally random chance of getting access to the tokens.  \n\nHowever, there are whole groups of people that are given access before any \"retail\" are even allowed to buy in.  These are developers, \"Influencers\" etc.  They are \"whitelisted\".  They get \"pre-sale\" access to buy in early, etc.  Some are just \"given\" bags of tokens as a reward for shilling the project to retail on social media and then they are able to trade/sell before anyone else.  Their profit is guaranteed because they will be able to sell their pre-launch assets to all the retail as retail floods in on launch.  You don't want to get caught in that as \"retail\" you become the bag holder as the price runs up, and eventually settles over the course of hours, days, weeks to some much lower level of \"price discovery\"  Many of these \"insiders\" will be able to sell into the initial demand run up and profit handsomely, while retail is FOMO in trying to get a piece of the action. If they are fast enough, and have the right \"slippage\" they can get in and out with some initial profit.  If there are some contract restrictions or taxes that prevent them from quickly selling, they may get stuck holding the bag. \n\nTypically retail fomos in, gets a price that they will never see again, and then when price goes down, they are discouraged and sell out at a loss, only to potentially see prices rise over a long period of time as project matures and price improves, and then they get in later at a higher price to participate in the yield being thrown off as others dca in over time.  \n\nIt's a fascinating game to watch happen.",

Some of the best advice I\u2019ve heard that is indeed universally applicable: you need to simply be here and have money partitioned across multiple safe, trusted, & top-10/20 chains & their top protocols. This means no APEing; this means no chasing; this means buying premier blue-chips when the market is horribly red & down; this means not utilizing leverage nor options; this means responsibly but comprehensively allocating to chains\u2019 top protocols, but esp those without tokens, which is to say in those where an airdrop appears imminent.\n\nAdditionally, make the most of what you have: stake and/or farm. But, crucially, yes, be wary of farm tokens\u2014they trend to zero.\n\nBonus tip: if a chain isn\u2019t within, say, the top 10, but you believe it will soon be (total transactions & unique addresses are 2 phenomenal sentiment indicators; they are available freely upon a chain\u2019s explorer, where they are typically labeled as *statistics*), see what its dominant protocols are (the top one shall always be an AMM) and place a small percentage of your overall holdings of the chain\u2019s coin into that protocol\u2019s token. Yes, it is a farm token, technically, but there is a huge difference between, say, $UNI and a distant competitor\u2019s 56th largest AMM\u2019s token on the same (ETH, in this case) chain.",

It\u2019s kind of like building a crypto version of dividend growth portfolio.\n\nHowever, going all in on anchor is a really bad idea. There is way too much chance that Luna/Anchor will have a big set back, or just not be able to sustain the high 20% rate of return.\n\nI think a better idea is to find 10 opportunities that make between 15 - 30% income and put 10k in each. Ideally diversified across chains. This doesn\u2019t provide the same protection against falling token values, but I would sleep a lot more comfortably without all my money in one protocol.\n\n10 ideas for a decent yield are:\n- uniswap stable coin/ Eth pools - there is enough churn in the pool to expect a return higher than 15%\n- osmosis eeuro/osmo pool or ust/osm pool (noting the risk of more exposure to UST as with anchor)\n- anchor\n- VVS Cro/usdc pool\n- Trader joe wavax/usdt pool\n- solarbeam glmr/usdc pool (this one might be a little early)\n- pancake swap - bnb/cake\n- pancake swap - busb/bnb\n- curve/usdn - yearn (Eth)\n- wbtc - yearn (ftm)\n- stake Juno \n- cefi staking stable coins (Celsius/Nexo/Crypto.com)",

This way you reduce your risk by 50% while also having great exposure to gains.\n\nOne good example is ANC/UST from Terra which you should know. You can use the auto-compounding pool from Spectrum and make over 100%/year: https://terra.spec.finance/vaults\n\nThere are only two major risks in my eyes to this - ANC crashes to near 0 or Spectrum smart contract gets hacked. Both very unlikely. ANC is the most important altcoin in Terra ecosystem after Luna. So the risk/reward ratio is worth it. \n\nThe beauty of using yield farms with one stablecoin is that you reduce your losses when market tanks since half of your position always stays in a stablecoin. You do suffer from impermanent loss, particularly if the crash is severe, but if the shitcoin is sound like ANC, it should recover. Just don't enter at the top! \n\nNote that the ANC APY is so high due to inflation which will reduce with time as ANC has a clear release schedule. Just don't ape into shitcoins with NO max supply like... Wonderland scams. \n\nAlways do your research. I also recommend LQTY stacking, pays rewards into LUSD and ETH... around 20% APY/year right now. Will be higher in a bull run, see here more: [https://dune.xyz/dani/Liquity](https://dune.xyz/dani/Liquity)\n\nIf you liked my reply, hit a follow on twitter: https://twitter.com/DU09BTC",

Essentially you need to:\n\n1. figure out an exchange that supports both your tokens (e.g., uniswap)\n2. move all your assets to a network that supports the exchange you found in step 1 (e.g., polygon), it\u2019s possible that this will require you to first exchange your assets into an intermediary token (e.g., ETH)\n3. perform the exchange\n4. optional: move assets back by reversing step 2 if the bridge supports your target token\n\nThe moving in between chains is doing through something called a \u201cbridge\u201d. Bridges only support a handful of tokens to be bridged, hence the necessity to go to an intermediary token. Various different bridges exist, some with questionable security. My recommendation here would be to always check the official website of the chain first to see if they recommend any. E.g, polygon has an official ethereum => polygon bridge on their website.\n\nAs you can see it can get quite complicated \u2026 and costly. This is why you probably want to stick to 1 or 2 chains that support a wide variety of tokens and exchanges.",

Because of the fact that you are providing liquidity to many crypto assets at once, you are extremely exposed to impermanent loss.

The only exception is when you approve your tokens to a pool/stake that has a lock period during which you can't withdraw, but that should be clearly indicated on the protocol's website. Most often you can take tokens out of the pool whenever you like.\nYou keep full custody, so yes a hardware wallet would greatly reduce your risk and if it's about more money than you can lose without caring, I'd strongly advise getting a hardware wallet (been using Trezor with metamask for DeFi, works great).\nYou're trusting the smart contracts that you approved a transaction to. These are open source and can be reviewed. Generally using apps that have been around for a while with a lot of users (say Aave, Sushiswap, Curve, YFI, Balancer) is much more trustworthy than newer apps with a more niche userbase (way too many examples). I'm sure a lot of those new apps are in fact good and trustworthy, but as most people don't know how to review the open-source smart contracts for fishiness it's easier to use an app that's been around for some time if you're new to DeFi yourself. After a while you'll figure out what's legit and what's a ponzi waiting to implode (hint: 100000% APY yields are not sustainable, ever)",

These are the cheapest and quickest to transfer.\n5. In Kucoin click 'deposit' to get your XLM wallet address and the memo. Then on Coinbase click withdrawal, select XLM, then input your Kucoin wallet address AND the memo. The memo is crucial when sending XLM. \n6. Once received in Kucoin, make sure the XLM are in your \"Trading Account\" then go to 'Spot Trading,' select the XLM-USDT trading pair, then sell your XLM for USDT. Then select the USDT-UST pair, and sell your USDT for UST. For these steps just use the market sell option.\n7. Once you have the UST in your  Kucoin account, go to withdraw, select UST. Then copy your Terra Station address, and make sure to select Terra as the network. Send a small amount to test first. Each withdrawal costs $4, but it's worth it. I've had some withdrawals go through in a minute, others take 6 hours...\n8. Once received in your Terra Wallet, go to the Anchor website, connect your wallet, go to \"Earn,\" then click deposit. Make sure to leave $5 or $10 in UST as you'll need these for gas fees to do anything on the Terra network.\n\nIf you ever want to cash out of Anchor and get the money back into your bank account, you basically do this same process except in reverse.\n\nGood luck and let me know if you run into any problems!",

Go to a reliable exchange (Kraken, Coinbase, Binance or Binance US for example) and set up an account to buy crypto with fiat.  You will need to provide ID, etc.  Then deposit your USD or euro or whatever currency you are using and buy UST or LUNA.  If the exchange doesn't carry these then buy any other well-known crypto or stable like BTC or LTC or USDT, and then send it to another exchange (I use [simpleswap.io](https://simpleswap.io)) that offers UST.  In the meantime you set up your Terra wallet and open the account on Anchor.  Send the UST over to the wallet, and once it's there Anchor can connect to it and then you deposit the UST and get aUST tokens back in the wallet.  You can use these elsewhere, like Mirror, as collateral for loans and so multiply the yields even further.  I always move a small amount first, and then prove to myself that I can get it all the way back out, before venturing in with more.  Like right now I'm still trying to figure out how to get UST and aUST back out of Mirror where I'd put them into long and short farming...",

Hopefully, a lot of technology is coming out in addition to the one you mentioned to solve this problem. I think Plugnet's Otto blockchain was built to be be both secure and scalable (KYC and PoS).

The most important aspect is going to be accurately reporting any trades through KYC'd exchanges, as those are more likely to not slip through the cracks. When it comes to defi, I really doubt tax agencies have the capacity to track or enforce that *right now*\n\nSeems like most people agree that it's practically impossible to file taxes without having to \"simplify\" things, and even being as meticulous as possible won't make them any more accurate. For example, different crypto tax software will give different results.\n\nIn my \"not a tax professional\" opinion, the most important thing is going to be making a honest effort to pay your share of taxes, however it's done. If you allegedly cut some corners to make filing easier and still pay roughly the same amount, then I don't think it would even be worth the effort for them to try and dispute it.",

There are a few things that they do really well, and a few things that still need work. On the whole I like them. I haven\u2019t tried everything , so I can\u2019t say definitively where they stand relative to many others. I especially like their tax loss harvesting dashboard. If you keep up with your transactions throughout the year, they help easily identify tax loss harvesting opportunities. I\u2019m not sure if those opportunities will exist next year, though. \n\nAlso, many redditors use and recommend koinly.

But with that, comes real risk. The cryptocurrency market *as a whole* has grown leaps and bounds over the last decade, but many individual coins have come and gone. Crypto is in its infancy, but infant mortality is a thing. :)\n\nIf you've put your life savings in one coin, you may, in fact, be screwed permanently. Bitcoin cash? Probably screwed. Litecoin? Probably screwed. Tron? Probably screwed. Safemoon? Don't make me laugh. PancakeBunny? Titan? IronFinance? Cryptocurrencies sometimes disappear. Sometimes they get hacked, sometimes they just slowly bleed out due to lack of interest or bad tokenomics. If you bought one of these coins at the top it's unlikely you'll ever get your money back.\n\nThe simplest thing you can do to avoid this is diversify. Never put more than 10% of your money into any one coin--I'll maybe make an exception for very established coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Chainlink, but you still need to have a variety of coins in your portfolio. If you put all your money into Bitcoin cash at the top in 2018, you're down around 80%, but if you split 50/50 between Ethereum and Bitcoin cash at the same in 2018, you're up 40%. You might ask, \"why not just put it all in Ethereum?\" The answer is simple: in 2018 you didn't know that Bitcoin Cash would shrink and Ethereum would grow. You will never pick 100% winners, but with a diversified portfolio of well-chosen cryptocurrencies, it's likely you'll pick a few winners that will bring your portfolio up above the losers.\n\nI have a friend who picked 10 cryptos in March 2018 and put $1000 into each for a total of $10,000. 9 out of 10 of them lost value, but the tenth coin was ChainLink and his investment of $10,000 was worth $185,000 when he decided to cash out of ChainLink. That's the power of diversification: you can pick a bad coin 9 out of 10 times and still come out ahead.",

EOS, NEO, LSK, are examples I remember. Going back further, take a look at Namecoin and Peercoin: Peercoin literally invented Proof of Stake, a *huge* innovation which is the foundation for a lot of cryptocurrencies today, and that still didn't translate into them being a successful coin.\n\nEDIT: Found one that completely died. Bitshares PTS was CoinMarketCap #6 in November of 2013, trading at $7.62, currently trading at $0.00016.\n\nThe problem here is that people only look at the winners. You have people pointing out that even if you bought Bitcoin or Ethereum at the top of the 2018 high you'd be up now. That's true, but if you pick a random coin from the top 25 at a date close to the peak in 2018, your chances of coming out ahead are actually pretty bad. CoinMarketCap has a very useful [Historical Snapshots](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/) feature which lets you see what was going on in years past.\n\nThis might sound like I'm making an argument for only investing in the top few coins, but it's really not. For one thing: I don't think we can see another 100x gain on Bitcoin, because that would put it at an entirely unrealistic market capitalization, so I think there are better gains to be made investing in micro cap coins. There's historical precedent for very-established coins being unseated: Litecoin held the #2 spot for a long time, and now isn't even in the top 10, so I wouldn't be entirely sure that Ethereum can't be unseated. As for Bitcoin: there's no precedent for it not being the top dog, but I don't think it can continue to not innovate and stay #1 forever.",

AVAX is fine but the transaction fees are in the tens of cents, so a bit more expensive again.",

Maybe it\u2019s actually harder to keep a big coin stable because you need more money to do it. I\u2019m not saying this is the case, but being big is not directly linked with being safe.",

Large liquidity outside the terra ecosystem as well as nearly half of Luna locked in staking for 21 days is what will absorb the initial impact.  After that, arbitrageurs will come in to play when the price action slows down.  Continuous exit pressure from the terra ecosystem is less likely as UST expands further outside its own ecosystem.  Btc reserves are not yet fully implemented but getting that in place will provide another cushion for the fall.  All these intermediate steps break the downward momentum that is apparent in all death spirals.\n\nEdit: I sleep with staked luna",

World of warcraft was only the biggest game because of the timing, the internet was scaling and there was an mmo that you can play that was \"high quality\" the barrier to entry (monthly subscription) was a little MORE negligible than now right? Back then if you paid 40 dollars and 15 dollars a month it was like \"alright but all this game I get!\" \n\nNow in the world of fortnite and all these gaming changing free games coming out I am gonna guess that the HUGE games that we will see will be similar to fortnite where ANYONE can join but youre just another person, it isn't until you get the battle pass or buy a skin that you start to form our digital identity ALL WHILE playing the game you enjoy. \n\nRight now we have so many choices and so many free-expensive games, the thing separating them are the experiences or what they give in those terms. Elden ring for example is for a small set of gamers but OH BOY does it deliver to those gamers who want to go ALL OUT the whole game. But a more carefree gamer can't get into it right?\n\nSo if games in the future are going to require a purchase or knowing people in a game before a person can join YES I can and maybe will do well. But nothing along the lines of mass adoption. Being in an exclusive club is cool and it will always be a thing but gaming I feel will reach towards the \"free to start, earn digital assets by playing, cashing those assets out by selling them whenever you want\" \n\nI could be entirely wrong but a majority of people I know who game will NOT put money down to try a game out unless it's a AAA brand name game. And then those same people are weary of free games that kinda miss the hit, like halo infinite. \n\nI think blockchain gaming is a HUGE move forward but we have to make it worth to a regular person. \n\nLike how fortnite was like \"I mean I'll give it a try\" almost EVERYONE tried it. I think those will be the bog blockchain games personally. The ones we didn't know had NFTS until that last \"oh by the way you can sell your assets you get\"\n\nI've played a few nft games and most you have to pay to start and I did, but I totally recognize I am the minority when it comes to that. Most people won't and don't care and will prolly laugh at the idea. \n\nBeen bringing it up for a while now, regular people LIKE THE IDEA of owning their digital assets, they just cant picture how we can do it yet.",

There is also Sifchain and Emeris, and JunoSwap is live but doesn\u2019t have incentives yet. \n\nJunoSwap is finishing an audit which will likely be done this month, so incentives will go live then and likely be very high due to the low TVL. It will be launching a token called RAW which will be the main token for JunoSwap governance and incentives, however the DEX itself will be running on Juno Network (smart contracts network for IBC, JunoNetwork.io) and so require Juno for gas. I\u2019d recommend next Juno telegram \n\nhttps://t.me/JunoNetwork,\n\nJuno Discord, \n\nhttps://discord.gg/XYRKGWqR\n\nAnd Cosmos Airdrops telegram \n\nhttps://t.me/CosmosAirdrops\n\nThere are a whole lot more, join those communities and ask questions and people will either help you or direct you to the right place. Again, DYOR, do your due diligence, lmk if I can help any other way, and good luck sir :)",

Yes, I like one project over another and that's because the one provided better ROI than the other one. I have invested and created nodes in at least 30 projects. So that's why I have an investor's point of view. It is hard to be excited about a project when you invested $1000 and you are getting $1.50 per day in rewards, and the opposite is also true when you invest $1000 and get $30 per day in rewards. Which project you would be excited about and try to really dissect the path they took. This is my take and I will be making a video discussing all of these points. More than welcome to follow and leave the same comment there.",

Can you elaborate on how the NFT Marketplace DeFi projects work? Is it that the investor are investing into the marketplace not through the NFTs themselves, but the tokens from the marketplace in which they stake and earn APY, and the marketplace generate returns through the NFT transaction fees themselves? And if so, where does the real incentive lie - in buying the marketplace tokens, or transacting NFTs on this marketplace? (The latter would make more sense for project longevity, no?)",

So the way I believe Alpha Nodes marketplace will work is that it will list the NFTs using the Alpha coins as a currency (similar to ETH) and as usual 10%-20% of the listing price usually is collected by the Marketplace when buy/sell takes place. I am not sure if the Alpha will be burned right away or collected in separate account and burned once a week, something that UNIV has been doing. Also people inherently love trading and that's why just collecting fees from Alpha NFTs can bring initial revenues, this wont last too long probably 2-3weeks before the volume will start to dwindle and then probably it will be up to the Alpha team to promote their marketplace to invite new projects similar to what LOOKS did. Again at this point I can only speculate exactly how Alpha will work. Also I dont think there will be staking, probably it will be more of a node type of project when you forever give up your ALpha tokens and given Node/NFT that will yield daily rewards.",

All the others use the term \"nodes\" to mean some artificial thing you can buy that magically creates a fixed yield... So you do your math to figure out how long until it pays itself back, never bothering to think about where all that yield comes from... Naturally it's from other people buying in after you do, and eventually it all comes crashing down with all but the early adopters left holding the bag. \n\nBut I digress...

I dont want to roast you but to educate new users and let them know that they should not do that unless they understand the risks.\n\nTLDR: no diversification, no risk management, including a ponzish project, not sustainable.\n\nFirst of all, you should not think you have learned everything in just 3 month. It is a very short timespan, and clearly you are still lacking experience. Yes it may be working right now but this is a recipe for disaster. I mean, if you are aware that what you are doing is gambling then it is all fine but you are presenting it like a solid investment. \n\nSecond the DOs and DON'Ts are correct i am not arguing about that, but it doesnt require a Genius to know that \"you should buy low and sell High\" or \"do not FOMO in\". I mean, duh? \nIf the purpose of this post was to get advice from more experienced users about your strategy okay, but you are suggesting this crap to new users who doesnt know anything about defi and can't the real risk of what they are doing.\n\nOf course i will explain why in my opinion this is not a good strategy. Then you can do what you want with it. \n\nFirst, you made and example with 100k but you never say what is your total net worth in this example: if you are a millionaire then putting 100k in this strategy is completely fine. I wouldnt do that but if you lose it all you can just move on. On the other hand if those 100k are all your money, well you are risking way to much. \nYou understand that 90% of your asset is on Anchor, which is a new protocol on the almost 1y old Terra blockchain. This is so risky, from UST depeg to hacks. \nBut lets imagine this will never happen, Anchor is relying on TFL money to give its 20% APY. Nobody knows how much it will last and what the % will be when it will be self sustainable. \n\nI was pretty excited about YieldNodes, i really like ponzi schemes. They are the best way to make money (if you create them of course). But hey i think that betting 10k in a casino is way funnier and you get free drinks too!\n\nThe fun part is that you put 200$ in \"degen plays\" without realizing that this whole strategy is a degen play.\n\nI can go on, but its getting too long. If you have any questions feel free to ask. And of course you are free to do whatever you like, just be aware that you are risking a lot by doing this and even if the best case scenario it wont last for long. \n\nIMHO if you had 100k to invest in defi you should put at least 20% in a stablecoin pool (USDC-BUSD for example). Another 20k in stable-crypto pool (ETH-USDC)\nDo not you just one protocol, say you put 10k on curve, 10k on aave, 10k on compound, etc.\nThen you can deposit a good chunk (like 30%? depends on your risk profile) in anchor and/or cefi to get higher rates. \nNow you can use those 15k left for various LP, if you really like degen plays 5k should do. You can't really invest in microcap with 200$.\n\nThats it.",

It's interesting to read what you wrote just couple of months ago. Eg. in Nov I was super bullish on TIME/MEMO, for the same reason everyone was. Now just 3 months later, I can see what a scam that guy was pulling off and I had suspended my reasoning in favor of FOMO. Since crypto moves so fast, you'll be amazed at how much you'll think differently in only a few months!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep learning, keep sharing!",

But, I didn't realize, there are many nuances to what \"being early\" really means.   \n\nI didn't realize at first that there are people who are given private access to project resources earlier than I am.  I initially thought project launch means, they turn it on and everyone has an equally random chance of getting access to the tokens.  \n\nHowever, there are whole groups of people that are given access before any \"retail\" are even allowed to buy in.  These are developers, \"Influencers\" etc.  They are \"whitelisted\".  They get \"pre-sale\" access to buy in early, etc.  Some are just \"given\" bags of tokens as a reward for shilling the project to retail on social media and then they are able to trade/sell before anyone else.  Their profit is guaranteed because they will be able to sell their pre-launch assets to all the retail as retail floods in on launch.  You don't want to get caught in that as \"retail\" you become the bag holder as the price runs up, and eventually settles over the course of hours, days, weeks to some much lower level of \"price discovery\"  Many of these \"insiders\" will be able to sell into the initial demand run up and profit handsomely, while retail is FOMO in trying to get a piece of the action. If they are fast enough, and have the right \"slippage\" they can get in and out with some initial profit.  If there are some contract restrictions or taxes that prevent them from quickly selling, they may get stuck holding the bag. \n\nTypically retail fomos in, gets a price that they will never see again, and then when price goes down, they are discouraged and sell out at a loss, only to potentially see prices rise over a long period of time as project matures and price improves, and then they get in later at a higher price to participate in the yield being thrown off as others dca in over time.  \n\nIt's a fascinating game to watch happen.",

Some of the best advice I\u2019ve heard that is indeed universally applicable: you need to simply be here and have money partitioned across multiple safe, trusted, & top-10/20 chains & their top protocols. This means no APEing; this means no chasing; this means buying premier blue-chips when the market is horribly red & down; this means not utilizing leverage nor options; this means responsibly but comprehensively allocating to chains\u2019 top protocols, but esp those without tokens, which is to say in those where an airdrop appears imminent.\n\nAdditionally, make the most of what you have: stake and/or farm. But, crucially, yes, be wary of farm tokens\u2014they trend to zero.\n\nBonus tip: if a chain isn\u2019t within, say, the top 10, but you believe it will soon be (total transactions & unique addresses are 2 phenomenal sentiment indicators; they are available freely upon a chain\u2019s explorer, where they are typically labeled as *statistics*), see what its dominant protocols are (the top one shall always be an AMM) and place a small percentage of your overall holdings of the chain\u2019s coin into that protocol\u2019s token. Yes, it is a farm token, technically, but there is a huge difference between, say, $UNI and a distant competitor\u2019s 56th largest AMM\u2019s token on the same (ETH, in this case) chain.",

It\u2019s kind of like building a crypto version of dividend growth portfolio.\n\nHowever, going all in on anchor is a really bad idea. There is way too much chance that Luna/Anchor will have a big set back, or just not be able to sustain the high 20% rate of return.\n\nI think a better idea is to find 10 opportunities that make between 15 - 30% income and put 10k in each. Ideally diversified across chains. This doesn\u2019t provide the same protection against falling token values, but I would sleep a lot more comfortably without all my money in one protocol.\n\n10 ideas for a decent yield are:\n- uniswap stable coin/ Eth pools - there is enough churn in the pool to expect a return higher than 15%\n- osmosis eeuro/osmo pool or ust/osm pool (noting the risk of more exposure to UST as with anchor)\n- anchor\n- VVS Cro/usdc pool\n- Trader joe wavax/usdt pool\n- solarbeam glmr/usdc pool (this one might be a little early)\n- pancake swap - bnb/cake\n- pancake swap - busb/bnb\n- curve/usdn - yearn (Eth)\n- wbtc - yearn (ftm)\n- stake Juno \n- cefi staking stable coins (Celsius/Nexo/Crypto.com)",

This way you reduce your risk by 50% while also having great exposure to gains.\n\nOne good example is ANC/UST from Terra which you should know. You can use the auto-compounding pool from Spectrum and make over 100%/year: https://terra.spec.finance/vaults\n\nThere are only two major risks in my eyes to this - ANC crashes to near 0 or Spectrum smart contract gets hacked. Both very unlikely. ANC is the most important altcoin in Terra ecosystem after Luna. So the risk/reward ratio is worth it. \n\nThe beauty of using yield farms with one stablecoin is that you reduce your losses when market tanks since half of your position always stays in a stablecoin. You do suffer from impermanent loss, particularly if the crash is severe, but if the shitcoin is sound like ANC, it should recover. Just don't enter at the top! \n\nNote that the ANC APY is so high due to inflation which will reduce with time as ANC has a clear release schedule. Just don't ape into shitcoins with NO max supply like... Wonderland scams. \n\nAlways do your research. I also recommend LQTY stacking, pays rewards into LUSD and ETH... around 20% APY/year right now. Will be higher in a bull run, see here more: [https://dune.xyz/dani/Liquity](https://dune.xyz/dani/Liquity)\n\nIf you liked my reply, hit a follow on twitter: https://twitter.com/DU09BTC",

Cosmos has always been about interoperability and are the leaders in that department it's akin to what Chainlink is in for oracles. Personally I'll say look into Kaddex for knowledge gathering and research purposes https://kaddex.medium.com/ it's the only one so far that is based on proof of work built on kadena which runs 480k TPS at zero gas fee.

Bad for bag holders to some degree, but great for people just wanting to do defi.  One of the few chains where you could be someone that only makes $500 USD a year and feel that the gas fees were reasonable.\n\n**Binance Smart Chain** isn't the cheapest by far, but they have an advantage of being attached to a centralized exchange.  There are tons of wrapped versions of tokens to play with in their ecosystem.  Venus is their top money market and to my knowledge, it's literally the only money market where you can use: BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA, MATIC, DOT and a bunch of other tokens.  The ecosystem has wrapped versions of AVAX, LUNA, FTM, and ATOM as well.  It's the only defi chain with the potential to let you use basically every L1 token worth mentioning.  It has centralization issues to a high degree as a con, but it has undeniable pros as well.\n\n**Solana** is cool but it's kinda limited right now in liquidity despite the high total TVL.  But I do like how similar sized many of it's protocols are.  It's not all clustered into 3 or less things.  It's just that none of those things are particularly big right now.  It's still a growing and developing platform.\n\n**Terra** is cheap enough to use and the fee structure is such that the gas token, LUNA, appreciating in value does jack shit to increase fees, unlike basically every other chain.  It's just a very \"top heavy\" chain.  Tons of liquidity mostly in like 3 protocols and it's logarithmic ranking.  In a lot of chains, the top protocols are within a similar range.  #3 on Terra is like only 25% of what #2 is and #2 is only half of what #1 is.  What it does is super cool but the ecosystem isn't as thriving as the total TVL would suggest if you're thinking it's like all the other chains.\n\n**Avalanche** is cool but it's pretty expensive to use when AVAX starts mooning.  The eco system is nice.  It has multiple money markets and dexes which is a good thing.\n\n**Polkadot** and **Cosmos** are too small right now for my liking.  God bless the people on them and I actually have bags of them, but I don't like to get into defi until there's billions of dollars in protocols.  Let other people be the stress test and experience the defi growing pains.\n\n**Cronos** has the Polkadot/Cosmos issue of being too small for my liking on top of the chain being stupid expensive.  Doing smart contract stuff might be like 5 CRO.  That's already pricey as hell and CRO is only like $0.50 USD.  It's going to be nightmarish when it's worth a dollar or more.  Do you know what it's like to pay 7 CRO for a failed transaction?  I do and it isn't a fun experience.  That was a side of guac or queso at Chipotle.\n\n**Fantom** isn't bad but the fees in FTM can be a little steep sometimes.  The #1 protocol ultra dwarfs everything else, but like 2 through 6 are well matched in TVL.  I used beefy on it to farm my FTM bag.\n\nI mainly use **Polygon**.  Good mix of trusted protocols, liquidity, speed, and low fees.  Plus it's EVM so I don't have to download another wallet to interact with it.  It's not the worst thing in the world to be non-EVM but it's super convenient to have everything under one roof, all at the same address.  I haven't used Solana yet because I just don't feel like going through the process for the APYs I've seen.  I do use Terra and they aren't EVM.  Steady 19% to 20% on UST on Anchor was worth the hassle and you can bridge easily from BSC, which is important for me because a lot of CEX in the US won't let you withdraw to non-Ethereum chains so I'm usually having to send stuff into Binance.us then withdraw to BSC to get assets into the defi ecosystem at non-crazy ETH prices.",

You definitely can\u2019t catch me sleeping on any of these opportunities that will begin to show up in crypto projects. Despite how big I am on ETH, I am taking a huge bet on some other of these projects. \n\nFor example, projects like DAFI and YLD caught my attention with their APY but the attraction has gone past APY now. DAFI had partnered with a lot of projects to adopt  their synthetic token mechanism whereby these projects make a one-off payment by purchasing DAFI token off the open market which in turn is then distributed to the staking pool. If DAFI goes on a parabolic run this year, it wont come as a surprise to me.",

Where the Networks will organise their staking model by themselves\n\n\\- The NFT META sector under working\n\n\\- The GameFI with the first integration as SuperStaking adopter\n\n\\- The SuperStaking itself for the DAFI investors that is giving so huge long term APY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's see where can go in a few months! Also waiting bigger partners on implemetation after this test phase ;)",
