If it were held by a small number of people lets say a few million and they all pulled their bags off exchanges, yes that would be significant. But the distribution of coins is not uniform and most, sadly, are held by whales and exchanges. So some tiny bag holders like you, I or anyone one else in here will make no difference. Its a fantasy. It amazes me that people think that shorts are the main cause of what we are seeing. The knee jerk reaction is \u201cpull your coins\u201d, \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d etc. The whole damn market is down and not because of shorting. \n\nHere\u2019s a question for you, if you pull all the coins off the exchange where will people wanting to short buy coins? If no one can buy coins how do you get price action? It amazes me that people think limiting supply to this extreme will be good for their investment. Price, liquidity and volume are all directly related to availability. Its basic stuff my dude.",
