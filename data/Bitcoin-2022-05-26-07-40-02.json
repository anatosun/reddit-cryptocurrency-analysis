Message comes from Josh Gausden's IG account financejosh or the one I had the message from financejozh as your finance expert\n2. He will advise you to sing up an premium account by paying $20K and he becomes your account manager.\n3. Interactions are done only through the Live support team on Union Bazaar or via WhatsApp \n4. Josh will encourage you to buy SEC signals at $1200 each/10 per week for the 24 hour trade etc which I did. Eventually the SEC signals started $1800 each.\n\n5)Target will be set at $1M\n\n6) Once the target is achieved, you will be asked to pay 20% upfront fees\n\n7) You will be asked to download a version of blockchain 6.34.4 where they will access the account, deposit $1M into you account etc.\n\n8) The deposit is done under non-spendable Bitcoin means its of no use. And they will set up minute by minute deduction on the same account and transfer it back to [www.unionbazaar.com](https://www.unionbazaar.com/)\n\n9) Any negative reviews by you will be deleted by [www.unionbazaar.com](https://www.unionbazaar.com/) in seconds. and all of the recent 5 star reviews are done after I caught them out.\n\nI was scammed by Josh Gausden or someone impersonating him. But all of my interactions with both IG accounts proves that it Josh indeed. I have screenshots to prove it. Overall, I had lost $600K or more under this scam. Maybe I should just post the whole whatsapp chat with Josh here.\n\n\\#joshgausden #scam #unionbazaar #beware #personalfinance",
