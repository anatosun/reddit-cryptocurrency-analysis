            "selftext": "\\>Now of course the title is I will admit it a bit of a clickbait however the question is can mining crypto and crypto in general become more environmentally friendly and what are the ways to achieve this, 100 percent is hard to be achieved but 80 percent could do.  \n\n\nBitcoin mining alone actually consumes  enough energy to power entire countries, the carbon footprint of the mining is several billion tonnes of carbon monoxide a year, hardly eco friendly right.  \n\n\nNow one way to mitigate this is to find new more efficient ways to mine crypto which some are experimenting on right now  the other way is to switch our attention more to crypto/blockchain projects that focus on renewable energy sources like (WePower, Ledger, Empowa etc) or projects that focus on the common good  that could in the long run, although  not directly, develop communities making it possible for them to switch to more eko friendly energy sources (Giant, World Mobile Token ) that focus on developing and connecting underdeveloped regions of the world.  \n\n\nWith our climate and well the world in general going to hell, it is of paramount importance we find new and innovative ways to better our society and I believe that cutting back on carbon emissions and finding new and better ways to produce energy and combat global warming are the ways to go.",

There is no point in selling when it costs nothing to hold and you just create more wealth. PoW fixes this issue by miners having to sell some of what they mine in order to pay for their costs of securing the network, and by doing so distributing wealth. This is the main issue with PoS as there is no incentive to actually do anything with the tokens that are created or distribute wealth because the people with the biggest wallets who are generating the most have no incentive to sell as they control/secure the networks with literally zero work.\n\nPower is only as dirty as its source and as we move into the future and move away from dirty energy by reducing the cost of renewables, we will have no problem maintaining PoW networks.

I can't for example in my apartment. You need to figure out storage, expensive hardware, cooling, sound isolation, figure out running costs, electricity etc etc etc\n\nSo what's the result:\n\n - PoS: the system doesn't punish you by diluting your coins because it makes it incredibly easy to participate in the issuing mechanism and it's fair to everyone. Everyone's wealth is constant.\n - PoW: the system punishes most small holders by diluting their coins because only the very fortunate and with big pocket$ can afford to run mining operations at a profit and acquire more coins (selling is a very small %, big miners operate at very large profits). Economies of scale make it so that only the largest mining coroporations earn all the newly issues cost: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/29/marathon-digitals-record-purchase-of-bitcoin-miners-will-cost-879m/",

This also requires a massive increase in demand response on the grid. Bitcoin will fill the gap and basically help subsidize renewable energy development by becoming a demand response solution that effectively \u201cprints money\u201d when we are overproducing solar/wind. Furthermore, as more and more of these demand response programs come on effectively using \u201cfree energy\u201d that can\u2019t be used otherwise it will drive up competition and push out miners using energy that is more in demand or less efficient, which is a good thing.\n\nEdit: non-biased source - https://www.iea.org/reports/demand-response\n\nAnd remember that to a grid, POW is literally pure demand response.",
