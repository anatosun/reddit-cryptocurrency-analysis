At the moment, Coinbase will only support BUSD as an ERC-20 token and all of the same token there is. There are currently no updates of supporting basic BSC tokens but will definitely let you know if there's any news to share. We suggest checking the [Coinbase Blog](https://blog.coinbase.com/) and the [Coinbase Help Center] (https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase) for more information and future updates. Thank you!",
