Imagine a world where alts didn't exist... where would we be?\n\nThat idealism seeds the discontent.  Then combine that with the fact that 99% of alts are,  without a doubt,  pure scams... \n\nI own alts, and i understand there was no way humans would all work on btc. We have too much ego and greed to be so intensely and loyally collaborative.  But i wish vitalik and all the good devs of actual good alts focused their abilities on btc, 1st layer, 2nd layer, etc. We are still not sure this whole thing is going to work and be accepted.

You are wrong,  but fine, another consensus chain would be necessary. \n\nLook.  Empty your biases. Btc, the world,  etc would be better off if everyone in crypto worked on the same chain. The argument against that is weak.

The flip side of that argument is,  btc base layer is more decentralized than eth, primarily due to the existing complexity of eth which gives it native smart contract functionality but also bloats the main chain reducing node count, increasing initial sync etc. Some people argue that functionally those things don't matter, eth is decentralized despite being built on low full node count.. that's mostly accurate.  That same argument applies to defi on btc. The trust model may be weaker, but functionally it will prove to not matter. Is there a functional difference between the federated model and what eth base layer is today? Not really... and thats ok. Eth still works. Rootstock probably will too",

You have the good premise, it's just that you didn't bring it to the end of the reasoning. \n\nMiners mine to ensure that one person bringing 51% of the hash rate is way too expensive. That's why the Bitcoin network doesn't want to lower the target difficulty. In a sense, the network locked itself into a mechanism of high security and high expenditures. And this will worsen as BTC's price will increase.\n\nThe weird part is that BTC's security is way higher than it was in its beginning. At some point, I would have believed the network would have wondered how much is too much. But I guess now they're simply too afraid of change itself. They have to much and don't want to lose it.",

It's a matter of considering what can be changed by the system. Incentives themselves can't be changed (unless if you consider changing the nature of the incentive, but that would mean replacing PoW and I'm pretty sure the Bitcoin network isn't ready for that). And I agree that reorg also is part of the threats, but uncle management isn't something new or impossible. It can't be a reason in itself. \n\nIf the block reward were 0, mining would entirely depend on fees and would need high enough and stable enough fees to justify mining. In practice, that's what awaits BTC long term.\n\nI see what you mean: mining would then be done by less people with less mining rigs, which would reduce global consumption. You're right, I think. \n\nThat said, the system requires enough electricity to be consumed to guarantee no one can attack it with 51% of the hashrates. Whatever they do, they'll have to find a way to keep costs high.

            "selftext": "Alongside some of the other [recent paradigms](http://block.auction/) for decentralized exchanges that we have seen emerge, I thought that I would offer a third alternative. This borrows some ideas from [Nick Johnson's proposal here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/54l32y/euler_the_simplest_exchange_and_currency/), albeit with many simplifications, and is also very similar to how prediction markets like those in gnosis and augur operate already. \n\nThe main challenge that I see with the MKR market, etherdelta and other markets right now is the high spreads, often 10% or even higher. A large part of this is that market making is very expensive, as creating an order and removing an order both take gas fees, even if the orders are never \"finalized\". State channel-based solutions could theoretically resolve this, but are far from being implemented. My proposed solution is to use the style of \"on-chain automated market maker\" used in prediction markets in a decentralized exchange context.\n\nThe mechanism would look something like this. The market contains an internal state, `PRICE`, which is the current market price. It would also have two parameters, `FEE`, and `DEPTH`. If a user wants to buy `ORDER_AMOUNT` coins, they would raise the price to `PRICE + ORDER_AMOUNT / DEPTH`, and pay `ORDER_AMOUNT * (PRICE + ORDER_AMOUNT / DEPTH / 2) * (1 + FEE)`. Essentially, this constitutes buying an infinitesimal number of coins at every price point between the old price and the new price.\n\nNote that this is not risk-free to set up: it requires an initial deposit of both coins and ETH, and if the price jumps around too quickly it could get exploited. One way to reduce the risk is to put orders into a queue for X blocks and while an order is in the queue other users could \"snap up\" the order, offering to pay a more favorable rate than the original offeror; however, this has complexities of its own and could be left to a later version.\n\nUsers have the ability to \"invest\" in the market. Investing and divesting are proportional: for example, if the market currently contains 2000 ETH and 400 tokens, then an investor would need to provide 2000 * p ETH and 400 * p tokens, which would increase `DEPTH` by a factor of 1 + p and give the investor a `1 / (1 + p)` \"share of the market\". When the investor wants to divest, they are entitled to take out a `1 / (1 + p)` share of whatever ETH and tokens are in the market out at that time (perhaps with a few-hour delay to prevent divesting itself from being subject to front-running during crashes). The theory is that in most cases, the fees collected will be larger than any losses from front-running attacks against the market maker, and the specific mathematical structure of the market maker ensures that risk of loss, while present, is strictly bounded, and in any case investors are the party that will bear the risk.\n\nOne concern of the above scheme as given is that the market would have to have a \"maximum price\" after which it runs out of tokens to sell. One solution is that at some point (eg. when `PRICE` is more than half the maximum price) instead of increasing `DEPTH`, the market simply keeps the depth the same and holds the tokens so as to increase the maximum price that the market can sell at. The market may even choose to _decrease_ depth automatically. One stronger solution is to make depth itself proportional to `1 / PRICE`, and change the formulas accordingly, but this leads to the opposite problem if the price goes too low; hence, some kind of dynamic balancing is going to be necessary in any case.\n\nThe advantage of this scheme from an efficiency perspective is that it offers very low spreads, but at the same time only requires a blockchain transaction for actual trades, not placing or cancelling orders. The design is also relatively simple to understand and implement.\n\n**Edit**: for those looking at this thread in the future, I thought I would add a simplification suggested by Martin Koppelmann. The mechanism would be a smart contract that holds A tokens of type T1, and B tokens of type T2, and maintains the invariant that A * B = k for some constant k (in the version where people can invest, k can change, but only during investment/withdrawal transactions, NOT trades). Anyone can buy or sell by selecting a new point on the xy=k curve, and supplying the missing A tokens and in exchange receiving the extra B tokens (or vice versa). The \"marginal price\" is simply the implicit derivative of the curve xy=k, or y/x.",

I believe it addresses most if not all the issued raised here as well as offer additional utility.\n\nThe solution is based on user-created \"Bancor-enabled tokens\" (BETs) which hold other standard ethereum tokens (reserves), with a user-defined \"Constant Reserve Ratio\" (CRR) for each of the held reserves in a specific BET. BETs autonomously issue themselves in exchange for reserve tokens, and transfer reserve tokens to holders destroying BETs. The price is calculated continuously according to the CRR and the reserve balance, so the market-cap of a token with a 10% CRR in ETH would be its [ETH balance] / [ETH CRR]. \n\nA token with multiple reserves calculates its own market-cap, in each of its reserves. When the calculated market-caps are not equal in value (i.e. do not match the external market-prices) an incentive to arbitrage and realigned them is created. \n\nBETs holding multiple reserves totaling 100% CRR would function as decentralized ETF, while BETs with less than 100% CRR function as new currencies, creating new credit gradually as they grow, and are intrinsically liquid.\n\nWe would be happy to get any feedback and comments on the first draft of the whitepaper. \n\n[Bancor Protocol Whitepaper](https://goo.gl/1WNx2l)\n\nhttps://www.bancor.network",

It's also a bit weird that after someone does a market buy order, a new investor will put in less of the token that was sold and more of the token that it was bought with. Getting close to running out of tokens on either side is a big risk like this.\n\nTo fix these issues, I think it would be good to have separate depth for both buy side and sell side, and ability to invest to either side separately or to both in whatever proportions. When someone does a market order to buy `x` percent of the tokens `A` in the system for token `B`, the depth on the sell side would decrease by `x` percent and increase similarly on the buy side. Also anyone who had a share `Ps` of the sell side and 0 of the buy side before that market order would continue having the same share of the sell side (with now less depth), and now have share `Ps*y/(1+y)` of the buy side (with increased depth), where `y` is the percent of increase of tokens `B` in the system. Any fees should be added to the sell side depth.\n\nDoing it this way should make it more interesting for traders and speculators to participate if they lean even slightly to either the bullish or bearish side. Another benefit is increasing incentive to invest on the sell side and decreasing incentive to withdraw your investment from it when the price increases, and vice versa for the buy side. This would help with keeping the sides balanced.\n\nI have to admit I was lazy and didn't do the math on whether that actually works without exploit possibilities, but if it does, it would make sense to do it like this right? It could more closely mimic normal exchanges I think. Maybe some of you folks with ultra high IQ here can instantly see that this doesn't work lol...\n\nEDIT: in the first paragraph, `Ps*y/(1+y)` instead of `y/(1+y)`.",
