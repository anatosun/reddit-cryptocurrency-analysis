            "selftext": "Micha\u00ebl van Poppe, a known crypto trader, said it\u2019s been a few days since he marked $28.4K as his target area on Bitcoin, and he is still watching to see how the market will react.  Notably, prices were rejected at $29.4K, so Poppe will see how the lower ranges will play out. \n\nA flip of $29.4k could trigger a move up to $32.8k.  He said that he is still monitoring the situation and will update his viewers if anything changes. $28.4k is the line in the sand for Bitcoin marked a few minutes prior.  The market has been consolidating around $30k since last week also having its impact on most other altcoins including new projects like LuckyBlock, Bitgert, Bobcoin, etc, and it looks like a move lower could be seen in the next few days. His target area of $28.4k, which is where he expects to see some serious buying interest emerge.  Prices are likely to fall further below $28.4k, resulting in a drop to $26k or lower. \n\nThe crypto trader advised his viewers to take note of the $29.4k as a key level for Bitcoin prices, which have been consolidating around $30k lately. A move below $28.4k could trigger a further decline towards $26k, according to the crypto trader.  Source: https://coinquora.com/michael-van-de-poppes-take-on-bitcoin-today-btc-surge-soon/",
