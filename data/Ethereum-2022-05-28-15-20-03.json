The daily gwei and bankless are some good recourses to follow to translate lots of the technical jargon for normies like us. (I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve never sat through more than a few minutes of an allcoredevs call, but if you follow the right people it\u2019s not too hard to at least have a general pulse of where progress is at.) \n\nAnd we\u2019re so fucking close.

It's 3 mega upgrades packaged into one.\n\n**First: Issuance**\n\nBitcoin halvings are catalysts for bull runs, every time. \n\nThe Merge contains the equivalent of **three halvings all at once**.\n\nPlus, whatever ETH is issued post-merge is locked for at least 6 months. \n\nPlus, we have ETH being burned on-chain, so ETH is highly deflationary for at least 6 months. And if gas is >30 gwei, it's deflationary no matter what (which has been >99% of the last year). Gas usage is trending down - so at worst Ethereum is inflationary by 0.1% (a 99% reduction).\n\n**Second: PoS**\n\nRegardless of the merits of PoW - it isn't popular. Forget what you know of PoW vs PoS, it's the narrative that counts (where price is concerned). A switch to PoS will bring tremendous appeal in terms of ESG and institutions.\n\n**Third: Staking**\n\nValidators will receive nominal, baseline inflation of 1200 ETH/day, plus fees from transactions. \n\nEthereum will be the *only* blockchain that is self-sufficient, aside from BNB. Both Ethereum and BNB earn enough fees to forgo block subsidy. All other chains dilute holders, including Bitcoin.\n\nThe staking queue has been full for months. Imagine post-merge? I think the staking contract will absorb an unimaginable quantity of ETH.\n\n**Bonus: Technical complexity**\n\nSome have compared the merge to \"changing an airplane's engines mid-flight\". Indeed, the merge is one of the most technically challenging endeavors in blockchain tech *ever*, and a major bug could derail it badly. Many are sideline, waiting for confirmation of a successful merge. While I think this is illogical, it could make the merge a \"buy the news\" event.",

I secretly fantasize about going through my log of Reddit comments after the merge happens and posting a \"how about now?\" Snarkpost on each of those months-old threads when it happens.\n\nI've worked on giant software projects on several occasions throughout my career, and I would have *dreamed* of having the ability to say \"this isn't actually ready yet, I'm not 100% sure it will work\" and then actually having the schedule slip to accommodate that. Sure, eventually it'd reach the point where the remaining work and testing is just spinning wheels and the trigger needs to be pulled regardless, but Ethereum's clearly not reached that point yet so the delays have been good things. This project is trying to produce an absolutely bulletproof release.\n\nThe one thing that I'm expecting post-merge that will make me pull out my hair is the anticipated stream of \"why did it take so long? That was *simple!* And why haven't the fees gone down like we were promised?\" ignorance that will replace it. It'll be Y2K all over again, all the work that went into making the release smooth and seamless will by its very success make people question whether it was worth it.\n\nBut oh well. I barely care any more. The merge is coming and all the ignorant yammering about it can have exactly zero impact on it at this point in the process.",
