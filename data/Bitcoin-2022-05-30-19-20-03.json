I'd tell a friend how TV brainwashes people, and get a typical response like, \"Yeah, but I don't let it affect me.\"  To which I would reply with the first few words of a famous commercial \"jingle\"/message... and they'd know the rest, without even trying.  I'd repeat that for several famous jingles/messages.  I'd then ask them, \"When did you sit down and decide to memorize all that?\"  Never.  Before today, you didn't realize that people paid to have their message stored permanently in your brain.  Now, consider how much other bullshit has been permanently parked in your brain without your consent, without your knowing it...  An intellectually honest person will \"get it\" and agree right away -- but those kind of people are few and far between in my experience.  \n\nStill, people are slowly stumbling upon and trickling into Bitcoin.  \n\nWhen the shit hits the fan, there will be a mad rush to board this lifeboat.  At that point, people who already own Bitcoin will be greatly and financially rewarded.",
