We have clarified with our wallet specialist that when using the QR scanner to send your assets outside of your wallet account, it will only show the first and last characters. Unfortunately, there isn't a way to expand and view the full address of the recipient. We will take this a feature request to improve the Coinbase wallet app.\n\nAlternatively, if you still wish to view the full address, you'll have to complete the transaction and get a hold of the hash ID. You can use blockchain explorers to view the transaction and you should be able to view the full address from there. Thank you!",
