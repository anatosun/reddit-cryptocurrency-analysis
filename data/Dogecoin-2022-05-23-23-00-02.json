If you have access to the coins and enough money, you can literally hijack the coin and take the price wherever you want. Supply & Demand becomes irrelevant. You can control supply and demand with coins you haven't even purchased yet. This is a real problem for the crypto market because this is practiced religiously in the Stock Market. This is EXACTLY what's going on with GME and AMC. We must take a similar approach and remove coins from exchanges. \n\nOne of the biggest issues I see with crypto is there is no protection from things like this. They can still get away with it in the stock market but they have things like SSR to \"limit\" the amount you can short a stock in a day. With coins like #dogecoin there is no such thing. If they raise enough money they can theoretically short it down to Shiba numbers with little blowback from regulations. This is a huge problem. Outside of owning our actual crypto, we need regulation. There has to be a standard we hold exchanges and HF with. Otherwise, we will find ourselves in the age-old battle between ethics and legality. Technically, they're not doing anything illegal even at this moment but is it ethical? If we don't set concrete terms they will play with boundaries to line their pockets and maintain control.
