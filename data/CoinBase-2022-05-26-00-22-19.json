            "selftext": "Of course I bought just $2 worth of Arpa Chain crypto when I saw this - just wanted the $5 Bonus really. No Bonus showed up. The promotion appears right at the top of the app, on my Assets page, and has a little button to push to go get your $5 Bonus for buying any amount of crypto. When you push the button, it takes you to the purchase screen - so I purchased $2 worth of crypto. The $BTC didn't show up, I didn't get any email or verification about it - nothing. So I called the number for help. I feel like that was a mistake because the girl didn't speak very good English, she had never heard of the $5 promotion, and I feel like she's just going to do something to get my account locked or something. I can't post a screenshot here? Ugh. And Coinbase has no help email. Super. Anyone else?",
