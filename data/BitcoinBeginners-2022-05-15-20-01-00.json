Even if one is convinced, the evidence only supports the claim that the **dominant miner may have generated significantly less than a million bitcoin in our view. Perhaps 600,000 to 700,000 bitcoin** is a better estimate.\n\n>**None of the above says much about whether the dominant miner was Satoshi**, although we know Satoshi mined block 9, which we have allocated to the dominant miner in our analysis. **However this is in a slope of just 11 blocks, so it\u2019s certainly not conclusive**. Whoever the dominant miner was, it is of course **possible the keys have been lost or discarded by now**.\n\nThus block 9 and genesis block was created by Satoshi 100%, and the evidence reflects he might have mined 11 blocks at least in addition to the genesis under these assumptions .\n\nThis means the evidence suggests we definitely know satoshi mined 2 blocks , and likely mined 11 blocks, and that **perhaps** there was a dominant miner who mined between 600-700k bitcoin(not blocks). **There are other explanations for the extranonce pattern that do not point to a dominant miner. Simply a similar software setup can cause this.**\n\nSince there was over 5 days between the genesis block being mined and block 1 and difficulty was 1 it would be safer to assume satoshi waited for other miners to start mining before joining in .You can check this by looking up any block explorer between block 0 and block 1",

Even if Satoshi mined, he mined alongside other people who joined the network. Some people like Hal Finney, disconnected later because the fan got too noisy. But again, everyone was free to join and leave.\n\nPremine means unfair - the creator gives chance to nobody and creates the coins without paying for the energy like the rest of the miners. Similar what (for example) Vitalik did when he created 72 million coins for free and let the miners to work on the other 40 million over the years.",
