            "selftext": "L2 adoption is increasing at a good pace, but it still has mountains to climb. Many of the major centralized exchanges still only support L1 transfers, forcing users to pay expensive bridge fees to on/off ramp, or just not participate in rollups at all. Beyond that, Optimistic L2 fees are still magnitudes higher than competing EVM compatible L1s and sidechains such as Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche.\n\nI mentioned Optimistic Rollups because ZK Rollups with EVM compatibility aren't ready for production yet. I actively use Arbitrum and Optimism and love the the experience, don't mind the fees although I live in a 1st world country, I can see how they can still be a barrier of entry for people living in less financially fortunate countries.\n\nAll things considered, the issue that bothers me the most is that still, so many large dapps I want to use are  either only available on L1, or very limited on L2. One example of this is Abracadabra. What's holding dapps back from integrating rollups?\n\nThere's so much innovation out there on other L1s and sidechains, I want to see that innovation in Ethereum L2s as well. I used dapps on Terra daily, sadly Terra is in the gutter now but it had an awesome DeFi ecosystem with a ton of TVL (excluding Anchor). Solana also has many promising projects that only deployed on Solana, yet it's often congested to almost a halt. Yes, Terra and Solana contracts are written in Rust, but Solidity is still the mainstream smart contract language, there must be other reasons why L2s aren't developer's first pick, specially as there's a ton of innovation on Ethereum as well but that doesn't fall back to L2s.\n\nFinally, can we the community do anything to help increase L2 adoption?",

                    "response": "I think there's a problem of liquidity transfer.\n\nLet's say you have a DApp on the L1. And you want to offer the same service on the L2. Many people have their liquidity on the L1 Dapp. They're earning money or anything else from it (various services) and removing their funds would mean a loss. Without already other people on the L2, they'd presumably not earn as much.\n\nAs such, there's a *coordination* problem.\n\nSo, to me, what is lacking is a DAO for users to show their *commitment* to have their funds transfered to the L2 DApp if a given *threshold* of other funds get transfered too. \n\nIt's just the same problem as any crowd funding use case. You want to fund, but only if it means the project will then have enough funds to have any realistic possibility of becoming successful.\n\nSo, that's what these Dapps should do.\n\nThe only other alternative I'd see would be to only offer upgrades on the L2 and stop any upgrade on the L1. At some point, people would prefer the L2 to the L1, notably new users and any older user who would find the upgrades really helpful or much needed. But even then, you can't really prevent anyone who wants to to offer an L1 DApp upgrade or competition and postpone this kind of resolution.",
