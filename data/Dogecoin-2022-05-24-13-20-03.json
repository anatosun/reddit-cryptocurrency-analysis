You don\u2019t know your keys, or even what wallets you have. And unless you back up after every transaction, not all your coins would be recoverable in case of disaster.\n\nDo yourself a favour and get your keys out and turn them into text wallets. Then you can throw the client away.\n\nJust go into the console and use the DUMPWALLET command to create a text file with all your wallets in it. Put this file and a copy of the coinb.in website on multiple removable media and store them in safe places. Problem solved.\n\nThe file will contain at least 100 wallets, in three categories.\n\n* Named wallets are the ones you\u2019ve requested or imported.\n* Change wallets are where excess coins are sent when you move coins. And you\u2019re not told about them, which is a risk.\n* Reserve wallets are unused, spare wallets.\n\nNow, as for how to use wallets. Allocate one wallet for every entity or purpose you interact with, and never mix coins because this will permanently link them together in the blockchain. Thus compromising your privacy.\n\nJust add a comment to the end of each line saying what that wallet is for. So for example you might have wallets marked sodogetip, RobinHood, Coinbase or whatever. And then you would move coins to/from these wallets only for those services.\n\nThere is absolutely no need to generate new wallets for every transaction. That\u2019s a pretty screwed up idea that came from Bitcoin paranoia. Just don\u2019t lose your keys, don\u2019t let anyone else see them, and don\u2019t mix coins and you\u2019re good to go.",
