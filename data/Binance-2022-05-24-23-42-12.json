While the amount stolen was mostly insignificant, about 9usd worth, it is still an annoyance having a balance of 0 since that makes me unable to pay fees until I buy more.\n\nIs there a lesson to learn from this? besides buying a hardware wallet... TXN hash is 0x83f8bbdf3c5bbcd7f8fc5e29796d5112b49a8221be21ca63ff661311421828da in case someone wants to see it, not sure if this would help anyone in anyway but yeh, just wanted to share o/",
