            "selftext": " So, long story short, my account has been \"Under review\" since February, after a year of normal usage. So, I cannot use buy, sell, convert, send or receive. Basically, all of my assets are locked on Coinbase. No explanation was ever given. This is the final update after my last attempt to contact them.\n\nI've tried literally everything, to no avail. I had never even thought of this being a possibility. Like, what would happen if your financial institution just locked all of your assets, and contacting them was completely useless? I'm guessing this cannot be legal.\n\nI've just received an automatic email telling me that support closed my ticket, again, yet nothing is resolved. AGAIN. My account is still \"under review\" and all of my assets locked.\n\nI've been more than patient. When it all began, I've waited a few months, then I've tried to get help via the online support twice then I've called also twice, then I came on Reddit and even spoke directly to a Coinbase rep here. I've worked in customer service for years so I know what I'm talking about when I say that I feel like I have been a great customer to deal with. I truly don't understand how a company's service can be so bad on so many levels.\n\nUntil my issue is resolved, I'll be initiating legal actions. I'm not trying to be a dick, I just really don't know what else to do. I've tried everything, literally, and not only have I not been able to get help but I don't even know why my account has been put under review after nearly a year of casual use (only buys, no sell).\n\nThank you Coinbase for teaching me what I've been reading online for years but never TRULY understood : not your keys, not your coins.",
