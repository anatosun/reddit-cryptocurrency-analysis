Maybe it\u2019s just for day traders but even so, if TA was accurate every investor would be making millions. Also how does TA predict when bulls and whales are buying and when bears are selling? Wouldn\u2019t everyone be able to play the market and be profitable if TA worked? Disclaimer, I don\u2019t know much but ik a lot of people that talk about it and they are usually wrong.",

All of the indicators like RSI, Bollinger Bands, EMA, MA... whatever the fuck you want... they are all PRICE ACTION and VOLUME over time information.\n\nThe second aspect of viewing the market is the FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS, or FA... In that data you look at the underlying dynamics of the asset. In case of BTC, network usage, Exchange ratio, Whale ratios, Hash Rate... and so on... many numbers go into it.\n\nFinally, you get the third piece and that is your own perception of the market and how YOU interpret the data.\n\nIt's an art form and I know many artists that paint wonderful market analyses... one's that I hope to get to one day.",

Most people don't even know what it is, most who do use it poorly.\n\nEven those who are good analysts and try to trade will fail, often because successful trading is mostly about risk management.\n\nThink of TA like play calling in football.  There are all kinds of ways to do it, and you only get ahead if you figure out a way to outsmart the other guys.",
