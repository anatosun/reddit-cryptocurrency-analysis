Whether the people living in Russia are for/against the war, the currency has taken a hit impacting everyone's financial security and future.\n\n\nBitcoin simply offers borderless payments to anyone, anywhere for any amount.

Harder for people online to call it out as fake when the place in question is \u201ca shop outside Nairobi\u201d instead of a specifically identifiable place in a major city. \n\nAnd like, duh, of course nobody is going to want to use BTC in commerce. Its strongest proponents bang the drum continuously about how the price is only going up. So either you don\u2019t believe in BTC, and therefore you don\u2019t spend any because you don\u2019t have any. Or you do believe in BTC, and so you don\u2019t spend any because you believe it will only be more valuable in the future. \n\nThe commerce angle is just a non-starter, I think.",
