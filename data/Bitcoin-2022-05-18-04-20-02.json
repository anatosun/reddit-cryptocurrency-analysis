However, the FDIC only insures the USD funds in exchanges. This is due to crypto exchanges being prone to hackers. For storing bitcoin and cryptocurrencies long-term, we\u2019d heavily recommend using a reputable hardware wallet.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.
