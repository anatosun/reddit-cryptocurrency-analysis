I really don\u2019t mean to be the guy who says \u201cim in it for the tech\u201d but I really appreciate a project with high quality technology and use cases.\n\nAfter using so many chains and services, I found that Polygon is actually one of the most diverse in its use cases.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t just settle as a scaling solution. It literally has an entire ecosystem going on that is capable of competing with entire L1s. This is even evident by the fact that at some point Polygon had more daily active users than Ethereum itself.\n\nAside from the fact that they\u2019re currently highest performing scaling solution, they also have a bunch of deals that expand their use cases.\n\nTheir partnership with Stripe is one great example. The fact that the 5th most used payment app in the US chose Polygon as their scaling solution speaks a lot.\n\nSo you can basically use Polygon for payments, NFT minting, P2E games, private transactions (nightfall) and many more use cases to come.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Polygon can do it all. And the fact that Polygon is this jack of all trades makes me really bullish on it long term cause we\u2019ve yet to see a chain with this much diversity in its use cases and overall presence in the market.",
