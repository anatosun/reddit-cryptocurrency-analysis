From my poor understanding, a delay in blocktime just means block gets pushed back and mined later?",

Solana is designed differently and therefore there is the issue that the calculation of the current time no longer matches the time of the real world if block time differs. dapps rely on this time and will therefore use a timestamp that does not Match the current time. thats not an issue for many dapps, but some need the correct time and will potentially fail or not work that well anymore.",

In practice this means that the block timestamp is a fairly reliable indicator of the time the block was mined to within a tolerance of a minute or so, although miners can game it a little bit.\n\nSolana seems to have a lot of quite bold design decisions like assuming block creation will never be delayed. I don't know it well enough to say whether they're very clever or very stupid.",
