We don\u2019t like people talking to our contracts.\n\nCI/CD? we only deploy to test by running javascript/python scripts locally. No one deploys on main network, that\u2019d be stupid, have you seen the gas prices? \n\nNext week we\u2019ll have a summit where we\u2019ll decide if we fork ethereum and deploy it on amazon. We\u2019ll call it Ethereum DeDecentralised.\n\nIf the proposal passes we\u2019ll make a startup and integrate ethereum with it.",

One like \"hey, you're family's dead. What? Why are you taking it so seriously? It was a joke! \"\n\nPro tip: for it to be a joke, you'd first need to show the lack of seriousness. If you're not aware of it, there are many people here who are dead serious when they're asserting any unbacked claims like yours. \n\nAs such, your behavior is completely identical to theirs from the point of view of an oursider. Don't be surprised if you're treated like they are.",
