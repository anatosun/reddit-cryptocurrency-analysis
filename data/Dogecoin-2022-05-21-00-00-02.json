They will re buy your coins at the discount and repeat over and over again. \n\nDon\u2019t fall for it. You buy the dip. And if you don\u2019t have money to buy, you hold. Your fellow shibes will pick you up. \n\nStrength in numbers.",

Please my fellow doges buy your dogecoin on Binance, Gemini, or Kraken.\n\nWe need to be honest as a community. Most people in the dodge community own it on platforms like robinhood. There are different levels of custodianship that allow you to truly own your dogecoin and gift it to others or buy things with it. We can not be hypocrites and claim to be dogecoin evangelist. When many if not all whales on this sub-Reddit own it in Robinhood. They say dogecoin has all these great use cases beyond just the community but they don\u2019t practice what they preach.\n\nThey all post Robinhood screenshots and leave all the dogecoin in the hands of corrupt brokerage apps like Robinhood. Why should we give you any recognition for your gain porn when you don\u2019t buy anything with dogcoin like the Maverick\u2019s merch and go support local businesses that accept it as payment. \n\nYou can't do any of these wonderful things because Robinhood won\u2019t let you withdraw it and use it as a currency. You definitely are too greedy to cash out and get real doge to avoid taxes. You are no better than the elite and corporations that do the same tax evasion. You post everyday to pump your bags of Robinhoods trash iou of fake dogecoin. I swear if I see another dogecoin millionaire screenshot from Robinhood I'm going to vomit.\n\nYou are misleading the younger naive generation of doge investors. You think it\u2019s okay to buy glorified shares of dogecoin and not true crypto but make fun of them for calling dogecoin shares.\n\nIf you are a doge whale hating on my post. Remember grimy people like you dumped on the beautiful do only good everyday community on the day you deemed as dogeday. We struggled to get past .420 what irony and trolls you are. I will never forgive greedy people like you that hate to see the truth.",

In fact, I bought Doge with $90 that didnt know what to do with (at 5\u00a2).\n\nBefore I knew if I was buying more and getting caught up in the game.  However, once I realized what the platform was I figured I'd wait for a dip and cash out.  That was when that whale was dumping million at 32\u00a2.    I made sure I was \"even\" so I didn't have any capital gains and then I bought Doge on Binance.  \n\nIt was a painful learning curve. Moving money around takes forever and I \"lost\" about 2500 coins in the process.   Now I'm working my way back up to 10k coins and buying on the dips. \n\nNow that I'm on binance it has opened a whole new world of trading (metamask, pancake swap, alt coins, P2P trading, etc).\n\nIt's not easy so make your plans carefully but it needs to be done to make Doge go to the moon. Eventually you'll want to buy your Tesla with Doge and that's not going to fun when it's stuck in robinhood.",

Just follow the KYC aka know your customer rules of kraken to verify your identity because you know Uncle Sam wants some of those gains. After you set up your account you can add your checking account. Once your account and bank are all setup you should be able to purchase dogecoin on Kraken and you can transfer out to a dogecoin wallet you own. You can use free wallet software like Multidoge, Dogecoin core, and the android app dogecoin Wallet. For super security you can get a Ledger or trezor device and store there as well.\n\nI honestly trust Kraken 1 million times more then robinhood so if you don\u2019t plan on buying things with dogecoin or giving it to family to spread the love and spark their interest. You can simply leave in on the Kraken exchange. You always have the freedom to take it out unlike robinhood.",

They want to conserve their winnings/earnings but most will buy back in when the dust settles. Problem is if smaller (cash strapped) investors is the majority of holders wheres the panic stop.  We need the heavyweight holders to ride the inevitable panic selloff or we need to educate the majority that this is a real coin and $1 is just the beginning.

When you sell $1B in 15 minutes, the price should come down. If small retailers panic sells, then the price comes down even faster, and the whale's proceeds will be smaller. \n\nNow the problem is when whale panic sells. \n\nA sophisticated whale should sell when there is enough limit buy order to back up his/her sale. \n\nBy the same token, buying the dip is also very difficult. If you watch it in real-time, you will see that massive sales when there are enough buy limit orders are filled almost instantaneously with buy limit order, so no market order can match it.",

If the price falls you will have money to buy more. The cheaper you buy, the more coins you get\n\n2-If the system allows you to \"program\" the buys (like buy when it reaches X price), schedule several buying orders for when the price is going down with the rest of your funds\n\n3.- have patience and buy only what you can spend\n\nMy english is not that good, but I hope it's understandable",

Like 5-10 grand sick. That\u2019s right when doge got exciting. I cashed out around 6-8 cents, doge literally saved my dogs life. His name is Cairo and he is the happiest 6 month old chow chow puppy you have ever seen. So that was fair. Now i have 100k doge. I learned my lesson. I\u2019m never selling my doge again.

If he has a skit about Doge, which he probably will due to it's current popularity, it will take some time for the casual fan to figure out how to go and buy it. \n\nI predict it will spike on Friday, dip a bit, then slowly rise on Saturday. Post SNL broadcast a bunch of people will sell causing the price to drop, but they are missing the fact that those who watched the show and are now intrigued won't be buying until at the very least Monday when they can complete a wire transfer to various exchanges and make the purchase. \n\n\nIt's history is Spike, dip to about half of the ATH and then hang stagnant for a while, then spike, then dip to half that ATH, lather rinse and repeat.",

At some point one of these coins is going to be the first to be worth WAY more than all the rest before it.  If Doge hit $100 thats what we are talking about, it would be not only the largest market cap of any crypto ever, it represents a digital currency then worth more than the GDP Of most places.   That would be an absolutely stupendous feat  and an event creating a huge amount  millionaires beyond the many already projected to get there by NOW $1 $5 or $10.  I feel like $10 is a reasonable long term goal.  Is Doge going to break records and create a world economy impacting amount of wealth?  I dunno.  Im sure going to Hodl and find out.  \n\n1 Doge = 1 Doge",

I've tried to sell little bits high and buy little bits low. Today is the first time I did it right. I gained 19.5 doges for free (sold at around \u20ac0,58 and bought at around \u20ac0.48). As I said, smol amounts. In hindsight I wish I'd done that with my entire stack but that's too much risk of losing all doges. I've got 100\u20ac waiting that I might put back in if it dips below \u20ac0,40 and if it's to the moon from here that's just profit. \n\n(no that does not make up for what I lost but it does make me feel good about today. Earlier an automatic sell order I forgot about yeeted nearly half of my coins in my sleep for 10 cents and the higher it gets the less I'm over that).",

You have to HODL and trust the process. There will be spikes and there will be a days of consolidation/stabilization. These days of stabilization are critical. So just take a breath, wait and HODL. \n\nAlso - This Saturday is just another day. Don\u2019t think too much into SNL. It will spike and/or it will dip. Happens every time.

For those new here, we typically see one massive dip a day then momentum towards the upswing through out the day and some resistance level touches around 8pm to 2am but we also see some high gains during this time.\n\n\nMomentum continues to push forward to the upside. Determining factors that are just news now are the following\n\nA few perspectives I have: \n\nSaturday: SNL\nIcons/staples promoting: Elon Cuban and such others. We keep hearing doge on CNBC as well. The more people talking about it and more conversation the better our resistance levels will hold.\n\n\nValue or expensive: This is still super inexpensive \u201ccoin\u201d lottery\u2019s ticket however you want to classify this as. Yes as long as people win that\u2019s all I care about. \n\n\nPlatforms: we are seeing doge is getting accepted on other platforms to buy and sell the \u201ccurrency\u201d can someone list all platforms where you can buy and sell doge on? \n\nI still have mine on Robin Hood sadly but I always put a new sell limit order 30-60% above current price just incase Robin Hood \u201ccrashes\u201d and or glitches again.  \n\nAcceptable forms of payment: keep an eye out on who is accept doge \u201ccoin\u201d \u201ccrypto\u201d as a form of payment just like the baseball team and etc\n\nMarketing: keep seeing marketing Ads about doge, on apps websites and nyc billboards and etc. please keep looking for doge marketing \n\n\nDoes anyone know if AMC looking into doge or anything along the lines for payment ? Can someone give a list or a resource of what companies or news on what or who is accepting doge?\n\n\nCurrently I have 9,996 coins of doge at .25 cent average costs.\n\nI\u2019ll be putting $500 once a day on dips till Saturday, if we see huge upswing before Saturday or on Saturday and before and after SNL it\u2019s most likely a huge liquidation coming from people that have 20k + in coin taking profits or someone that has more money then god playing around.\n\nNo way we can tell how this will go but we should all be aware, if we are a real community people will help and set new standards.\n\n\nI see this outlandish pipe dreams of it getting to $10 which in all honestly would be a god send for a lot of people but as a whole community and family we should think of realistic goals first of getting to a $1 which we will then trying to work our way to 1.50 or 1.75 etc etc etc. we need to have a plan and process to get to $10 we can just say $10 and grabs our ankles and bend over.\n\nNothing in the world works that way, we all need to put in effort and understand the more effort we put in collectively the more we can raise the price of doge.\n\nFomo is a real thing in life, this is real in a fake currency situation.",

Here is the best advise: HODL\n\nIn case you forget keep in mind:\n\n1. **DOGE is becoming main stream - it will survive in long term**\n2. **$1 is not the floor - it is still cheap - wait and watch**\n3. **FOMO is high - so everyone is grabbing whatever amount they can - so HODL**\n4. **NEVER SELL - remember a lot of early adopters of BTC sold when it hit $1 - now they regret.**\n5. **Learn from DOGE creator - in 2015 he sold off his entire share of DOGE to fund a used Honda Civic purchase - now he regrets.**\n6. **SPEND - Buy 100 and spend 5 to keep DOGE usable (credit:** u/EvilLinux **)**\n7. **DIPS - Dips are buying opportunities - if it dips DO NOT SELL buy BUY MORE.**\n\nThere are some Shibes here who want to sell for legitimate reasons (like paying off debt) - to whom I will say if you can hold off it will be great for you and the DOGE.\n\nI do not have an ultimate target but $1 is in sight, $10 is very much possible $100 is not impossible and anything beyond that is an achievable target.\n\nfeel free to copy and repost anywhere.\n\nHODL",

Here is the best advise: HODL\n\nIn case you forget keep in mind:\n\n1. **DOGE is becoming main stream - it will survive in long term**\n2. **$1 is not the floor - it is still cheap - wait and watch**\n3. **FOMO is high - so everyone is grabbing whatever amount they can - so HODL**\n4. **NEVER SELL - remember a lot of early adopters of BTC sold when it hit $1 - now they regret.**\n5. **Learn from DOGE creator - in 2015 he sold off his entire share of DOGE to fund a used Honda Civic purchase - now he regrets.**\n6. **SPEND - Buy 100 and spend 5 to keep DOGE usable (credit:** u/EvilLinux **)**\n7. **DIPS - Dips are buying opportunities - if it dips DO NOT SELL buy BUY MORE.**\n\nThere are some Shibes here who want to sell for legitimate reasons (like paying off debt) - to whom I will say if you can hold off it will be great for you and the DOGE.\n\nI do not have an ultimate target but $1 is in sight, $10 is very much possible $100 is not impossible and anything beyond that is an achievable target.\n\nfeel free to copy and repost anywhere.\n\nHODL",

However, they aren\u2019t on here and apart of the community, nor believe in.\n\nAlso the people making exaggerations about it going to 1 mil. a coin, don\u2019t listen to that as well. Focus on growth, realize there will be dips and if you want this to have a shot to make money, buy on dips and hold. \n\nYes this is risky, but it\u2019s up to us the value of a Doge. Elon and Cuban will boost it. If Bezos gets on board and it becomes accepted by major retailers it\u2019s a new game and who knows what can happen. I\u2019m willing to take the risk. Again, this is not advice, but my personal outlook. I\u2019m dropping more money on the 7th and 11th because that\u2019s how slow deposits up. Heads up, eye forward.

It could crash like 4/20, then again, this could be the tipping point that pushes it onward and upward.\n\nMy thoughts. IF the do an SNL skit, it brings recognition. People pour money into it, drive it up and the people holding a ton of coins sell, it drops and people drop and we see a crash, more people buy and here we go back to what this week was. This seems to be cyclic IMO with Elon. Boost up, drop down, boost up.\n\nEnjoy the ride. Anything could happen. So far it\u2019s pretty much put all financial analyst who talked negative to shame. So we will see.\n\nAbout my opinion on price. Under $1.00 = huge steal. Hit $1.00 and stabilize still a steal and $3.00-$5.00 seems reasonable. If you put shares at $1.00 and it goes to $2.00 you still may be able to double your money.\n\nThe more stability Doge proves, the better. Predicting is good if you are trying to actively buy and sell but if you are long game, focus on long game. For me with my shares, letting it ride is way more exciting than walking a way with a few thousand profit. Why? Because having hope is kind of fun. It could go either way. I have no idea but it\u2019s fun to see if you caught the wave before everyone else knew it was coming or ignored it. Good night y\u2019all! Rest easy, don\u2019t stress, have fun.",

If that happens then the price might hit close to 0.40, in which case we should buy in if it does happen. And if it does happen it'll also not just be people who sold off at a dollar who bought in, but NEW buyers too. Then the price after that will go all the way up to maybe $2 a coin. BUT..... *what if* no one sells... and it does get way passed $1 and hits $2 or $3.... Everyone that got scared and sold off out of speculation lost their opportunity to double or triple their gains.   \nWe all need to come to an agreement and steer the conversation to **HODL**ing even at a $1. *Temptation* and *FEAR* is the enemy. The only way we get this over $1 is by holding. People will buy in if Elon does help because the coin *is affordable regardless*. We must succeed at HODLing.",

Todays events are mild and really quite reassuring. Keep your cool if you've jumped on the  Doge Rocket and remember, you are a participant and your actions will contribute to reaching out mutual goals with Doge -- just standing by and watching will not help us push forward. That said, as always, NEVER invest more than you're  willing to lose. DON'T listen to buy or sell commands in the feed. DO your research, follow your gut, and be VERY wary of panic. \n\nSecondly, and in order ... when we get dips like this  and people (THANK YOU SHIBES WHO DO THIS) who watch whale activity post reports that whales  are dumping in large increments, that is the time  to buy. Selling your coins in a panic will allow whales to horde more at your expense. Dips are a good time to get in if you were already planning on it, the more the  currency spreads out to us small-timers, the better.  One of the primary concerns from big-time supporters was that there is too much concentration of Doge in a handful of wallets. If we buy during those periods (and NOT panic sell) then the currency by proxy gets a bit more  stable  as it is spread more  evenly. \n\nAlso keep in  mind the intentions of the community. Yes, money is a centerpiece, but we also want to build legitimacy, applicability in society, and promote charitable activities. The wider the adoption, the more interest, the more investors. \n\nHell of a ride guys and gals! I'm glad to be on this adventure with all y'all! Much love.\n\n\\-Sincerely, Shibe #42069",

Here is the best advise: HODL\n\nIn case you forget keep in mind:\n\n1. **DOGE is becoming main stream - it will survive in long term**\n2. **$1 is not the floor - it is still cheap - wait and watch**\n3. **FOMO is high - so everyone is grabbing whatever amount they can - so HODL**\n4. **NEVER SELL - remember a lot of early adopters of BTC sold when it hit $1 - now they regret.**\n5. **Learn from DOGE creator - in 2015 he sold off his entire share of DOGE to fund a used Honda Civic purchase - now he regrets.**\n6. **SPEND - Buy 100 and spend 5 to keep DOGE usable (credit:** u/EvilLinux **)**\n7. **DIPS - Dips are buying opportunities - if it dips DO NOT SELL buy BUY MORE.**\n\nThere are some Shibes here who want to sell for legitimate reasons (like paying off debt) - to whom I will say if you can hold off it will be great for you and the DOGE.\n\nI do not have an ultimate target but $1 is in sight, $10 is very much possible $100 is not impossible and anything beyond that is an achievable target.\n\nfeel free to copy and repost anywhere.\n\nHODL",

Here is the best advise: HODL\n\nIn case you forget keep in mind:\n\n1. **DOGE is becoming main stream - it will survive in long term**\n2. **$1 is not the floor - it is still cheap - wait and watch**\n3. **FOMO is high - so everyone is grabbing whatever amount they can - so HODL**\n4. **NEVER SELL - remember a lot of early adopters of BTC sold when it hit $1 - now they regret.**\n5. **Learn from DOGE creator - in 2015 he sold off his entire share of DOGE to fund a used Honda Civic purchase - now he regrets.**\n6. **SPEND - Buy 100 and spend 5 to keep DOGE usable (credit:** [u/EvilLinux](https://www.reddit.com/u/EvilLinux/) **)**\n7. **DIPS - Dips are buying opportunities - if it dips DO NOT SELL buy BUY MORE.**\n\nThere are some Shibes here who want to sell for legitimate reasons (like paying off debt) - to whom I will say if you can hold off it will be great for you and the DOGE.\n\nI do not have an ultimate target but $1 is in sight, $10 is very much possible $100 is not impossible and anything beyond that is an achievable target.\n\nfeel free to copy and repost anywhere.\n\nHODL",

However, even if you or someone watching SNL on Saturday comes in and wants to buy Doge at $1, it\u2019s still not a high price to throw whatever they/you feel comfortable with. It\u2019s all relative. People will buy at $1 and figure that they can ride the dips then. So, don\u2019t worry about whether or not you\u2019re too late to buy now. Do it if you have the funds available.",
