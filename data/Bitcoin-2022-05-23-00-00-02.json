Without knowing it, many people are playing the greater fool game, even those who eschew altcoin scams and refuse to dabble in futures gambling because it leaves others holding the bag.\n\n**Fact**: if you and everyone else believe something will increase in value consistently, you will never get rid of that valuable thing until it hits absurd levels, and then *someone* will dump back into fiat (maybe not you), collapsing it all.  You become a beanie baby enthusiast.  You are entering into a greater fool system of value.\n\nTo break out of this, there must be differing viewpoints on the value of the item - more people must believe it has intrinsic value (such as banking oneself, international payments, etc) than simply \"hodl value\".  This sub either forgets this (since those who sodl are mocked) or believes ourselves to be the chosen group who can ride the gravy train, while the masses must deign to use BTC as actual currency.  Because if you truly think 100% of humanity should hodl, you don't math.\n\nBitcoin's value vs fiat is rising for a variety of reasons, but we must make sure that one of them is **because it is - not can be - used as money**.  Hodling is fine, that's what a savings/checking account is.  But you still spend from it.  Circulate the coins so non-Bitcoiners get exposure *as consumers*, not \"investors\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd one more thing before you kids get off my porch - when BTC/USD goes *up*, we tend to say \"it's an inflation hedge\", but when it goes *down*, we don't say the USD inflation improved, for obvious reasons.  So let's stop saying Bitcoin **today** is an inflation hedge, as it is not there yet.  Change the language slightly - Bitcoin *will become* an inflation hedge based on its properties.  The **spot** increase and decrease in BTC price today is not so directly related to inflation (one may argue that the 5 or 10 year trend is, but the 50-90% dips which happen in a month and are reversed in 6 months have 0 to do with inflation, and the weekly prices ditto)",

Hearing old school bitcoiners talk about the early days they say things like \"we still weren't sure what it was\".  Looking to the future, there doesn't seem to be a strong idea of where we are headed exactly, even under the assumption that hyper bitcoinization is the end state; lightning for instance is an interesting platform, it offers this \"infinite liquidity\", but opening and closing channels still requires on chain action, so if 50 million people are using lightning it would be technically impossible for them all to settle monthly.  I had an interesting response to this on a mentor Monday, I was told eventually there would be no need to settle, I don't think there is a crystalized idea of how this will be possible if channels are only bidirectional.  Say we had channel factories, that solves opening channels bit not closing them, so the answer I have gotten is that we won't close channels in the distant future.  I am hopeful if not confident that we will resolve these issues, but to the best of my knowledge we haven't yet, and it appears that the original predictions that on chain settlements would only be for large institutions is going to come to fruition.  I am hoping to start a lightning wallet and run my own node soon, I don't think I have a sufficient conceptual idea of how it works, so maybe I just misunderstand the issue.  With that in mind, I am of the belief that we (like, even hardcore bitcoiners) are not exactly sure what the future of the protocol will look like.  If this is the case, its reasonable to assume that the future may be malleable to the desired use, for better or for worse.",

I think it is more likely to just be used by the powers that be to continue the status quo.\n\nI.e., the only way bitcoin gains mass adoption is through institutions abstracting away the complexity of ownership, through L2 and maybe L3 solutions for transactions, etc...

I have long loved lightweight programs that just work, or protocols that just work; look at IPV4 or IPV6, its not by government decree nor divine law that these protocols are ubiquitous, its just very good at what it does, and the reasons why match bitcoin in some senses like having limited design scope and highly refined code.  No other coin really makes sense, its like attempting to lead a revolt against IPV6 when it already does its job flawlessly and perfectly neutral, unbiased and ubiquitous.  This is what I want from bitcoin, it to do a narrow task extremely, extremely, extremely well, and let the rest (Netflix, google or Lightning, stike) Be built on top.  I believe in it's ability to transform our economy in many ways, least and soonest of all is eating into the asset market, jewelry, collectors cars, paintings etc. Are cheap replacements for the value you added to acquire them.  Traditionally, wealth would imply vast pools of money, today it implies all your money is tied up in investments that you hope are keeping up with inflation; bitcoin is a better asset, its liquid and fast, its value tracks economic output rather than lags inflation, even if its hopeium then at least there's a fixed supply.  Banks will chew it up as a tradable reserve asset, skip ACH.  Governments will want it to replace their failing currencies.  At small but unimaginable scale its already happening.\n\nOf course, it all comes down to who makes the decisions and how they are decided on, even bitcoiners with the best intentions will murder the protocol if discourse isn't conducted rationally.",

While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party",

                    "response": "In developed countries the usage is more of investment or savings account, as the local currency usually does not have 70% inflation and there is no dictator in charge. In less developed countries people use Bitcoin more as a every day currency if their own currency is shit and/or the government bans people from using local currency or tries to confiscate the money from people. There are several cases, for example women in Afghanistan, that Bitcoin is the only method for them to really own anything, as the Taliban takes from them everything they can.\n\nPoint is that anyone can use Bitcoin in anyway they want. There is no one single use case or one single method of how everyone should use it.",

A ten dollar fee for settling a billion dollars between banks is orders of magnitude more efficient than how's it's currently done. Customers won't even know they are using Bitcoin. \n\nLightning network can become the P2P payments network. Again settling every block on the BTC network for pennies a transaction. As mentioned in the comments Nic Carter has done great work on this idea.\n\nMore and more will settle on the network over time because it's the only non corruptable  ledger we have ever had. Bonds and real estate are the big fish we all hope for. \n\nThe cherry on top is it acts as a lifeboat for inflation giving us all a real option to fiat if money supply is managed poorly. My guess is this in time will force central banks to better manage their balance sheets as people can now run away from bad actors. (I think the future involves fiat for a long time so I don't think much about a BTC standard as much as the path to get there)\n\nYou are buying a piece of that network today at ridiculous value, even if price dips in the short term.",
