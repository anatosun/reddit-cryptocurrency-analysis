Projects that could improve every area of life developed like the ones that concentrate on renewable energy ( empowa, Legder), Sustainable telecommunications in Africa (World  Mobile Token, Giant) just to give you a sense of what blockchain is capable of and of course the application most known to us, crypto currencies with BTC, ETH being the most reputable ones.  \n\n\nHowever instead of harnessing the full potential of crypto, companies that started minting coins are now engaged in what is the absolute opposite of what the original creators of BTC meant for it to be, actions like insider trading with some individuals having knowledge of which coins will be listed in order to buy them before and sell them when their price skyrockets is more of the same stuff we have now in banking, stocks etc and it sickens me to my stomach.  \n\n\nDo you believe that companies who are found to be engaged in this trading should have their coins delisted from exchanges and banned for life for destroying the purpose of crypto ?",
