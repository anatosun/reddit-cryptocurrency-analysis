It shouldn\u2019t be seen as trash and in a place that\u2019s cleaned often (like that junk drawer)\n* Not near your other valuables. Because clearly, it\u2019s now valuable by association.\n\nWhen in doubt you can always [add a passphrase](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/what-is-a-bip39-passphrase) too.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in more tips, check us over at /r/seedstorage",

What do you think they do when someone stops paying for their box, or when they have a lawful search warrant, or when they have reason to believe there's something dangerous in one but the owner isn't willing or able to present the second key? Leave it sealed in the vault forever? No. If they don't have the second key they remove the cores and open the box.",

Any hiding place involves a trade-off between security and access. Hiding something in the sewer main beneath your floor and it's secure, but good luck getting to it. Hide something in your sock drawer and it\u2019s easy to get to but hardly secure. The best hiding places are easy to get to but tough to find.

I had my big ass safe stolen before and a paper somewhere hidden can always disappear and we are in 2022\u2026 Anyone who finds some words will know this is a crypto wallet phrase. \n\nThe best place is your electronic devices such as email, cloud and so on but that\u2019s too risky so this is how I solved it:\n\nI made my own cypher that I know of by heart and wrote my words electronically and saved multiple copies under a normal usual password too. I can give u some ideas and u can come up with as many as u want. \n\nUse alternate odd numbers for letters way: so if A is 1 then B is 3 and C is 5 and so on. The word ABC would be 1-3-5. Now save that. \n\nAnother way would be even numbers. A third way would be backward or backward even or backward odd. U can use shapes and so on. \n\nU can even use mixes of all. Like first word is even then it\u2019s odd and so on. As long as u know the way then it\u2019s cool. \n\nThis is my opinion and no one roast me please. It\u2019s just a suggestion coz we r all stuck to our phones and devices. I hardly can find where I put my passport let alone a piece of paper with some words!",
