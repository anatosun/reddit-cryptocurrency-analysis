Because essentially exchanges lend out coins to people who short doge . Watch David mitchells latest video on YouTube because he goes into more detail about it but it really does make sense and he makes good videos . If everyone who holds dogecoin holds it in personal wallets and not on exchanges it will impact the price in a good way dramatically . The math adds up .
