Removing your dogecoin from the exchanges and storing them in personal wallets like trustwallet ect will prevent the amount of people being able to short dogecoin because the exchanges won\u2019t be able to lend to the people who want to short . Because essentially exchanges lend out coins to people who short doge . Watch David mitchells latest video on YouTube because he goes into more detail about it but it really does make sense and he makes good videos . If everyone who holds dogecoin holds it in personal wallets and not on exchanges it will impact the price in a good way dramatically . The math adds up . Share the video in as many doge groups so people can be some more aware of how simple but effective it would be to do this .",
