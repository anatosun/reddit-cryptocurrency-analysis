In received messages I found this message with account information and I logged it just to check if the password works, pure curiosity. \n\nI managed to log in and the balance was 50btc indeed. I got really scared. The website DutchCoin.vip is very hard to reach, I mean I can not find anything on google about it and you can visit the site only if you type correctly (capital D and C).\n\nWhat is happening? I am really scared.\n[photos](https://we.tl/t-vjgllBSPEw)",
