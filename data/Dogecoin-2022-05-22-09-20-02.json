Many people have had coins disappear without their knowledge over the years.\n\nA much better approach is cold storage. In the form of text wallets, with multiple copies on removable media you can put in safe places so they don\u2019t all get destroyed at once. Search for \u2018text wallet\u2019 and have a read.\n\nAs for why to move your coins, it\u2019s quite simple.\n\nDon\u2019t listen to the \u2018short\u2019 people. They\u2019re spreading misinformation based on lack of knowledge of how things actually work. It\u2019s always easier to make up imaginary threats than to educate yourself after all. And haven\u2019t we seen many examples in the real world, in so many fields?\n\nNo, the real reason again comes down to risk. If you don\u2019t have the keys, then you don\u2019t control the coins. And you are at risk of losing them if the people holding them manage to lose them.\n\nThis has happened many, many times, in all sorts of ways. Some exchanges were elaborate scams. Some failed. Some had technical issues. Some were hacked. Some were robbed by their own employees. And in every case, the losers were the customers.\n\nThis is why we keep repeating ***\u201dNot your Keys, NOT your Coins\u201d***. You really don\u2019t want to leave your money in someone else\u2019s pocket and then hope they give it back when you ask.\n\nPlus, specifically with RH, they put a variety of hurdles in your way. You have to meet their demands to be allowed to request that they send your coins to you. They charge fees, which although admittedly very low, are still twenty times higher than they should be. They have arbitrary limits on how much you can withdraw. They take hours to fill requests. And they have outages especially when things are hopping.\n\nReally, do yourself a favour and get your coins while you can. And stay away from any client, including this new one that everybody is hyping up.",
