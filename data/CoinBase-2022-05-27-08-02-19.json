I saw a message that I needed to identify my Identity or else my account would be limited to withdrawals if I did not respond by July 17, 2022. I then contacted Coinbase and they told me to create a temporary account using a different email which I did so they can update my phone number. They then asked me to upload my Identity document and take a selfie which I did. I was then told to provide 3 months of bank statements which I did and answer 3 other questions which I did.
