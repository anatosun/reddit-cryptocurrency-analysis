Because of many factors, the dollar prices of homes have steadily climbed, the price of stocks have steadily climbed, the prices of most commodities are increasing, etc. The cost of homes priced in Bitcoin have dropped over the last 10 years. Does the real estate property actually have more or less economic value now versus 10 years ago? No, typically real estate has the same economic potential now versus 10 years ago: people can live there or do work there, same then as now. An acre of land is still dirt, plants, etc. The dollar price increases we see have a lot to do with currency debasement. The increased price is not so much about 'an acre can be used to create more economic value now versus 10 years ago'. In his extended interviews, Michael Saylor explains this far more elegantly and more clearly than I am able to in a Reddit comment. His interview with Lex Fridman is probably the clearest and most accessible explanation I have ever heard on the differences between the economic values of fiat currencies and Bitcoin.",

So on the point about stable purchasing power and the velocity of money, it is the case that BTC is changing... for the better.\n\nBTC often 'tracking' with NASDAQ shows that traders are using Bitcoin like a bubble, and harvesting the volatility like a bubble. Hodlers aren't doing this, though.\n\nBitcoin being used as collateral at many financial institutions shows us the solid core on the inside of this bubble, and the core is growing and also is going to keep growing. Because of this I prefer to see BTC as a growing peach rather than a bubble. The solid collateral core is the peach pit and the fleshy peach food is the bubblishiousness that all assets are experiencing to different degrees.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting point in all of this, is that some people (and some countries) are fomo'ing into a bubble and are unknowingly buying real, hard money that could financially save them, if they hodl their BTC.",

Well over 67% of stakers are in cushy first world jurisdictions like the EU and have already doxxed themselves to their respective, FATF compliant, governments. POS stakers are sitting ducks.  \nVitalik, joe lubin and crew either never considered a regulatory censorship attack or they actually welcome them because the legacy financial world wants censorship. Ethereum leaders have been in bed with [legacy finance](https://protos.com/consensys-lawsuit-jpmorgan-owns-critical-ethereum-infrastructure/) and [authoritarian regimes](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/02/ethereum-leaders-are-slowly-courting-persian-gulf-royals-and-investors/) since day 1. Ethereum is a trojan for tyranny.   \nBitcoin can't be stopped and that's why China banned bitcoin mining instead of using their 70% hash to do the 51% attack as described by pos shills like vitalik. Many EU politicians are now actively promoting POS coins over POW for the same reason. The reason is that POS can easily be censored and Bitcoin is almost impossible to censor.",

It strengthens the anti-Bitcoin positions of politicians in *other countries/regions*, like the US, and some fence-sitters will take the anti side now.  AU/NZ/GB obviously too.\n2. Nodes in the EU will likely be banned as well (most easily sniffed out anyway, they're public and unencrypted comms).  After all, they are technically supporting an illegal activity.  If because of #1 it's illegal in some States or countries, ditto there.\n3. Cash ramps are regulated heavily, and will just have to shut down for citizens in those countries, meaning you can't easily convert to/from cash.  You are limited to P2P, and likely it will be small amounts.  For safety, but also because the only people left using Bitcoin are in developing nations, and don't have a spare $50,000 to just hand over, or black market in nations that banned Bitcoin, which are almost all mostly *cashless* already.  Wiring money is clearly a non-starter unless you're already committed to being a structured black market entity.\n4. You end up holding a resource that won't be spendable in a wide adoption future, and you can't get rid of it without doing something illegal.  You won't dare travel to another country for an in-person trade, because the counterparty can just take your HW wallet and you can't complain to the authorities (the old sex worker conundrum).\n5. The government may do a pennies on the dollar cash-for-guns type deal where you send your BTC to them for small recompense.  Or they may not, because fuck you.  Governments be governmenting.\n\nWhat survives can be called \"Bitcoin\", but 90% of the people in this thread would have sold before #3, when the price dipped into the 20's **for a reason**, rather than FUD.\n\nSo instead of an echo chamber chorus of \"Screw them!\", go out and convince people why the energy FUD is just that, **starting with this reddit**.  Lots of new users who just see this trainwreck and think \"Bitcoiners == apes\".  Vote for the right people, campaign for the right people, and prevent those possibilities from even seeing the light of day.",

Let\u2019s call it $425 then add $25k for furniture/moving etc.  \n\nI would then buy my daughter a condo, something small, $150k range. \n\nThat puts me at $600k down.  \n\nTo retire, I\u2019d put 2 mil into sp 500 mutual funds, hoping for a 6% return a year.  That should give me $120k a year salary to live on the rest of my life.  It\u2019s a lot but i live in an expensive city and want to travel. \n\nThat leaves me with 1.4 million.  I don\u2019t see myself buying much more than 6-8 btc depending on price.  I wouldn\u2019t really need to invest and make money, it would be more of a safety net and hedge.  I still carry the mindset that crypto is volatile enough that i wouldn\u2019t invest more than i could afford to lose.  I put that sum around $300k given this windfall. \n\nThe rest of it?  I\u2019d buy a nice car, enjoy life a bit, and probably put some in a safety net like treasury bonds in case i fuck up.  \n\nAlso, whores would be involved.",

Get a second citizenship in a tax shelter somewhere in the world and buy real estate there. Pay off the mortgage and put the rest in BTC.  Some would go into an earn/interest program. If a dump happens and I'm bullish use a home equity line of credit to buy more and pay off as soon as the market recoups. The four years of cash gets me through a decent bear cycle with little risk.\n\nI love what I do so I'd just keep working as well. At 10million net worth I probably start living a little larger but I feel like the world is collapsing around us and where you were set for life as 3x millionaire it's now much more to protect from what might be coming.",

If you run a node but still have your coins on Coinbase, or don't have any coins at all, or have your wallet connected to someone else's node - you don't have \"a say\" on anything. It's not a democracy where [a particular number of nodes](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/opelu3/stupid_question_am_i_helping_the_network_by/h64ztod/) decides something, as you correctly point out.    \n\n> the blocksize wars were primarily a propaganda marketing operation by Calvin Ayre and Ver  \n\nHow does Ayre come into this? I don't remember him being around at that time, or at least he didn't play any role in any of that.   \n\n> resulting in a hardfork when some of the 99 percent became node runners.  \n\nWhat are you talking about?  \n\n> Anyone who remembers the blocksize battles will tell you that they were brutal. But what if I told you the next battle will be ten times worse?  \n\nI would say chill out and have a deep breath :)  We are far, far away from a type of situation that led up and culminated in the 2017 wars. Bringing celebrity trolling and terrorist attacks into this as an analogy is just.. bizarre. I'm not sure what the point of this post is supposed to be overall? What are your exact concerns with BIP119? Technical things, activation concerns?",

Pick green on the roulette wheel, or the 1000/1 outsider....\n\nOnly put in what you can accept never seeing again. All these crypto subs are full of hopium, much of it is very delusional.

On the other hand we have an impending recession headed our way because the fed can\u2019t cut rates enough to stop inflation and not crash the economy at this point.

Not sure about other countries. \n \n>Even good youtube videos/channels to watch to learn more.\n\nDon't listen crypto influencers, please. Most of them get paid to promote shitcoins. \n\nInvest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard is a must read. \n\nAlso, **don't reply any DMs**, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick and read this short guide, please:\n\nCongrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.\n\nPrice wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, nor next week. Statistically, it's less than four years from now. Anyone who bought Bitcoin at any point in the past and held it for 4+ years is in profit. \n\n**Try \"Bitcoin ONLY\" strategy for at least first year**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to.\n\nGoing DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. \nBitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for SATs. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://amber.app/calculate-your-investment/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference.\n\nNow, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at etoro, RH, PayPal or similar, get the real thing. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) \n\nInstall (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.\n\nA few good wallet choices:\n\n[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \\- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial\n\n[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \\- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial (although, Lightning is custodial!)\n\n[https://www.wasabiwallet.io/](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/) \\- Excellent privacy, Open Source and Non-Custodial\n\n[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \\- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets.\n\nLightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):\n\n[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \\- Phoenix \n\n[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \\- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza\n\n[https://muun.com/](https://muun.com/) \\- Muun, simple and elegant LN wallet\n\nHardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):\n\n[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \\- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.\n\n[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \\- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.\n\nThere's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. \n\nMake sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different than the first set, you're safe to use it. \n\nFind an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. \n\nThis little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.\n\nWelcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey.",

They already have more gold, and probably have more bitcoin, tho the latter is undeclared and probably being actively accumulated as we speak.\n\nAnything less than this will see the demise of the US as the world reserve, and they would be fools to give that up.

If property rights were upheld and government was out of the picture you wouldn't see them polluting at all because you would have angry customers, neighbors, and concerned citizens right outside their front doors with pitchforks. Militaries are the number 1 polluters. The ultimate scorching of the earth and poisoning of the water and loss of life. The massive amount of fossils fuels they consume keeps them on self destructive conquest for more fossil fuels and more war. A never ending cycle until we are all dead.

They banned and failed- they can try again but the result will not change.\n\n2. Your dad is right - if internet shuts down in the world then bitcoin will shut down too. But the possibility of that happening is one in 1 billion trillion. I will not bet on that little of a possibility.\nLet\u2019s say for the sake of an argument - the internet shuts down- but when it comes back up - bitcoin will also be back up in a new avatar. So what is the point shutting it down in the first place.\n\nJust tell your dad - \u201cNo power in this world can stop the idea whose time has come\u201d. \n\nAlso other way to kill bitcoin is to come up with a better technology, when that happens people will abandon bitcoin for something better.

Take a look into the China and India situation and look into the El Salvador situation. And look into the US and Europe situation.\n\n\nNote the differences in Government and economies. It's opinion but I see China as controlling. So they ban Bitcoin. El Salvador is a nation with a lot of issues and desperation. So they are trying Bitcoin as something new. The US wants to remain a technological power. So they will not be banning Bitcoin. They will try to regulate it and we see a clashing of money laundering laws and restrictions with growth of industries that are going to be US-first.\n\n\nAnd there it is.

It would have to be a goddamn big war to knock out all internet everywhere.\n\n\nEven if internet everywhere is knocked out, P2P networks like Loranet can't be stopped. Radio communication could still be used to keep the blockchain moving, albeit there might be some chain splits if it becomes too fragmented.\n\n\nBut, like, google bitcoin satellite.

Also, forgetting that Russia shipped most of the fertilizer that the World's farmers use to grow food without  anticipating making more in the USA and EU first. And then we have the electric car insanity here in the USA. If we stopped all production of gasoline powered cars electricity will also ramp up higher in price than gasoline is now. Also, the USA promised to help the EU with natural gas and is now sending some to them but not producing more... thanks Biden and company. We also don't have enough ships to carry the amount of natural gas the EU will need for heating. And, lets not forget the odd factory and food storage facilities going up in flames by coincidence.

Also because I lived in it two of the last five years I didn\u2019t have to pay any capital gains tax on the sale. \n\nIf I still want to invest in real estate I can do that in the stock market. Right now based on my life circumstances it makes more sense to rent because I\u2019m not sure where I will be in the next 2-5 years.\n\nI put 33% of the earnings from the sale in cash for now - will hold for 6-12 months before I make a decision on that cash. I put 20 percent of earnings to add to the Bitcoin I already had, and the rest I put into an index fund for a long term hold",

It just means that they are likely much less important, and therefore more trivial.\n\nThat also doesn't mean that I will sell my house and all of my other assets and borrow against my future assets to bet on the future value of bitcoin.  It just means that I can articulate a logical explanation for my conviction in the likelihood of bitcoin's significant appreciation in value over the long term.",

The end goal should be borrowing against your existing appreciating assets to fund the acquisition of additional appreciating assets. If your one Bitcoin goes to a million dollars, you want to borrow against that for the money for a down payment for a mortgage to buy a house. That way you captured the profits you've made in the form of a loan but don't have to pay taxes, and using that money you leveraged it to make more money. As the price of Bitcoin rises more, you can take out a new loan at the new valuation to pay off the old loans and repeat the process.",

So instant buying with cards on exchanges bought more bitcoin than market rate. Buy bitcoin with card, sell for cash, repeat. 5% profit per cycle at banks expense. This is caused by the fact that banks have UAH rate fixed at 30, but market rate is 32.5.\n\nYou can still buy bitcoin in Ukraine, just not with card \"purchase\", but with P2P, online exchanges or cash.\n\nNot only this, this was also done to prevent people buying dollars at that fixed rate in revolut or wise. I've been doing this arbitrage myself. It was so easy. Just buying dollars with card at 30, wiring it here, selling for 32.5.",

Thankfully, Wyoming is leading the way with serious pro-crypto state laws they have adopted over a number of years including some relating to the WY SPDI.

El Salvador with its pro bitcoin monetary policies and laws clearly is more advanced than the United States in this regard.  \n\nYet it's also necessary to have low earth orbit systems that have been developed by companies like Blockstream, SpaceChain, and others.  All these systems create unique forms of both insulation from adverse terrene regulation as well as providing redundant forms of security.  \n\nThanks for your comment.",

I am not moving anything, as I already have all my bitcoin on a hardware wallet, as proper opsec dictates. I can access my BTC any time, and I will.

The moment my german and belgian banks start asking inappropriate questions (which will be surprising for a bitcoin bank) I will have to use my swiss accounts. I do have an exit plan ready, although I do not believe I will ever need it. I suggest you do the same, if you have significant amounts of money there.",

Gresham's Law states that, given two monies with equal face value, people will prefer to spend the money with lesser commodity value and hoard the money with greater commodity value. It was relevant back in the days of bimetallism, when a \"dollar\" was defined both in terms of a mass of silver and in terms of a mass of gold. As the relative market values of gold and silver fluctuated, at various times gold dollars would be under- or over-valued relative to silver dollars, and so the \"bad money\" would drive the \"good money\" out of circulation. Gresham's Law has no application to Bitcoin because bitcoins have no face value by which to be under- or over-valued relative to fiat.",

Bitcoin is typically more restricted legally which does obfuscate whether the principle is at work, but wouldn't the idea be that as bitcoin is hoarded/valued more fiat is saved less and less and used first for transactions until nobody saves it and turns it straight to bitcoin and then people skip to not accepting fiat for transactions and demand bitcoin up front? So bitcoin fades from circulation as fiat is forced out of savings and then dropped as a medium of exchange?\n\nPresumably bitcoin volatility effects this, but we have long periods of sideways at the moment with drops and rises in-between the big swings. In a halving or two this may become unnoticeable for day to day use, would this apply then?",

Thus, people hoard silver eagles and spend paper dollars. The bad money (paper dollars) drives the good money (silver eagles) out of circulation.

Well over 67% of stakers are in cushy first world jurisdictions like the EU and have already doxxed themselves to their respective, FATF compliant, governments. POS stakers are sitting ducks.  \nVitalik, joe lubin and crew either never considered a regulatory censorship attack or they actually welcome them because the legacy financial world wants censorship. Ethereum leaders have been in bed with [legacy finance](https://protos.com/consensys-lawsuit-jpmorgan-owns-critical-ethereum-infrastructure/) and [authoritarian regimes](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/02/ethereum-leaders-are-slowly-courting-persian-gulf-royals-and-investors/) since day 1. Ethereum is a trojan for tyranny.   \nBitcoin can't be stopped and that's why China banned bitcoin mining instead of using their 70% hash to do the 51% attack as described by pos shills like vitalik. Many EU politicians are now actively promoting POS coins over POW for the same reason. The reason is that POS can easily be censored and Bitcoin is almost impossible to censor.",

Surely someone who can understand the latter has 0 confusion over the former?\n\nIs your audience general, or do they have a background in cryptography already?\n\nIf the former, perhaps strike out #5, #7, #8, #9, #10 - that's just not needed.  And #6 isn't so much a misconception as it is a diverse topic, because you are already not focusing on Bitcoin alone based on your course title, I presume.  Once you count other cryptos, you will find that actually ASIC mining is the outlier, not the standard.\n\nAbout the BTC focus - I think #3 is wrong for some non-UTXO cryptos.  And the way you have written it, your clause \"**since** wallets do not store your coins\" makes it sound like the reason a transaction doesn't send/receive coins is precisely because of the wallet's structure.  Well that isn't true.  It is because of the UTXO nature of Bitcoin and other currencies that a transaction changes ownership of existing UTXOs rather than \"sending\" them somewhere.  The wallets for *all* cryptocurrencies don't store coins, because a wallet is as you point out elsewhere a keypair with some sugar, hook to the blockchain, and UI poured on top of it.  The tokens are on the blockchain just like my $ is in the bank's database despite me having my bank's app on my phone to see it and interact with it (god willing).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt almost seems like your list isn't really \"misconceptions\" but \"miscellany\".  Even the 21m BTC item is on your list as a trivia point relative to ETH rather than a myth clarification (the myth being, \"Anybody can just change the software and make more BTC\" or \"How do I *know* there's only going to be 21m?  Who decides?\")\n\nIf that's the case, consider separating it into categories of miscellany like \"Cryptography in Bitcoin\", \"Economic factors behind mining\", \"NFTs and who the fuck cares really ;)\", and \"Token growth schedules, burning, and the merits therein\".\n\nIf going for true myths, check out the Bitcoin wiki for examples to get the juices flowing.",

Your clustering of topics was confusing for me to read through, even as an educator in the space, but now I get that you were intending to kind of \"checklist\" all the statements you were making that you wanted community validation on.\n\nI would really recommend, given this spread of topics and the amount of time you have available to cover it, that you link each new concept with a real world example that the students can follow up with. For some of these, like forks, a more anthropological view (Bitcoin blocksize wars or ETH rollback after the DAO hack) would be appropriate; for others like multisig, a hands-on experiment setting up multisigs on Bitcoin testnet and having students try to \"behave maliciously\" would be great.\n\nFinally, if you haven't already thought of this, doing a test run on your modules with a single listener of approx the same technical level as your pupils, and scribbling down any questions they have which indicate gaps in your explanation, can be super helpful with such a complex interdisciplinary topic.\n\nThanks for clarifying, and happy teaching!",

                    "response": "https://armantheparman.com/why-bitcoin-only/\n\nI want to start by stressing that it all comes down to scarcity. Without scarcity, cryptocurrency may as well be fiat. Good money is scarce. The biggest weakness of cryptocurrencies is that they can be created easily from nothing. All alts are like this. But Bitcoin is different. It has miraculously been born and has gained a huge lead in network effects. This can not be copied. Thus, it has gained scarcity. It is extremely decentralised, and has by far the greatest hashing power on the planet, and distribution of full nodes, which makes it not possible to tamper with the monetary policy. Bitcoin has scarcity due to network effect lead and \u201cun-tamper-ability\u201d.\n\nThe Lindy effect will only make it stronger as day after day it doesn\u2019t die. It can\u2019t be eradicated, just like a cancer that has spread too far.\n\nThe copies cannot compete with this. It needs the majority to not only leave Bitcoin, but mostly leave to the same choice. There are thousands of choices, so those few people that abandon Bitcoin will not all go to the same choice. In other words, defectors will disperse, not concentrate. The only way this could theoretically happen is if there is some fatal flaw with Bitcoin, AND it can\u2019t be fixed, AND an altcoin can, AND only one altcoin can.\n\nE.g. let\u2019s say Bitcoin\u2019s privacy weakness (really it\u2019s a trade off, not a weakness and any other coin with privacy just chooses a different trade off) is suddenly critical and everyone is exiting. Where will they go? Monero, Zcash, DASH, some to ETH and XRP (not private btw), Cardano\u2026. Can they all be money? Money printer go brrrr much?\n\nSo how else can an Altcoin take over? Remember that people will save in the best money. An Altcoin must become fundamentally better. In the open source world, how is that possible? It\u2019s like thinking it\u2019s possible for a better operating system to exist than the dominant open source one today (GNU Linux). The open source leader just gets better and better. All new ideas get absorbed.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine another currency finds a good use case. Let\u2019s say smart contracts. First that\u2019s like saying paper is money and valuable because contracts can be written on it. No, you need to make good money first, not find other uses for it. Aluminium has more uses than gold but it\u2019s less valuable because it is not money. It can\u2019t be money because it is not scarce. But even if smart contracts makes a cryptocurrency into good money, there are too many: ETH, Cardano, TRON, Iota, probably others.\n\nAs soon as any becomes valuable, it will invite competition and it will be copied. There is no scarcity. For goodness sake, ETH doesn\u2019t even work yet. Its Turing completeness is not even used. Bitcoin has smart contract capability and I understand nearly everything ETH is doing program-wise can be done with Bitcoin. Let\u2019s face it, it is competing with Bitcoin as a money and is far far behind and has no credibility. What will Vitalik Buterin do with the monetary policy next?\n\nETH is just another fiat with a central banker. That is not a true cryptocurrency. Remember why Bitcoin was born \u2013 we are fighting central banking and trying to separate money and state, not shoot ourselves in the foot by losing focus, trying to get rich by improving on the solution we already miraculously discovered. Bitcoin is that: a miracle \u2013 and we should embrace it.\n\nAlso, you mention ROI. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist so you can buy it and sell it for more fiat later. It is a REPLACEMENT for fiat. You buy and NEVER sell. You spend once it achieves its true value. You don\u2019t need an exit strategy. You just save in Bitcoin. With alts, you need to time your exit and sell to a greater fool, because alts are scams, holding forever will get you rekt. Just DCA Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s like picking up gold off the ground before anyone else realises it will become money. Don\u2019t pick up pebbles or seashells (alts), your pockets have limited space. Finally, the most important problem to solve is separating money and state. All other problems are tiny in comparison. We don\u2019t need to replace the legal system with smart contracts. We don\u2019t need a token for everything. We don\u2019t need to put bananas on a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is an invention that solves a humanitarian problem. Altcoins take a solution (blockchain) and try to find a problem. Remember that.",

If you Google about digital wallets, you will see many results where they claim that a digital wallet is an analogue of a physical wallet: It stores, sends, and receives cryptocurrency. When you define it like that, you end up with many forensics investigators who seize a suspect's laptop and think that if they keep the laptop turned off, suspect's cryptocurrencies stay in the laptop because they are stored in their wallet. I met more than 10 people like this. So we should be clear that a wallet does not store Bitcoin, it is stored in the blockchain.\n\nRegarding 7: A multiplication for an algebraic group (or field) is defined on group (field) elements. When you say 4P, you are not multiplying two points of an elliptic curve because P is a point but 4 is just an integer there. You are just adding P to itself 4 times.",

As we need to become more independent from Russian gas, renewable incentives are ever more important.\n> \n> To illustrate the above in a very simplified way, please consider this: Electricity usage of a country is not constant, we could build renewable generators for median usage and supplement with gas and oil at peak hours, or we could build for peak usage, and let excess energy at off peak hours goes into proof-of-work. This shorten the return on investment significantly and give us a way to build enough capacity for tomorrow.\n> \n> Further data:\n> - Global gas flaring (thrown away energy) can power 5.5 time the Bitcoin network\n> - Renewable curtailment (thrown away potential energy at off peak hours) in China alone can run 80% of the Bitcoin network \n> Source: \n> https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index/comparisons\n> \n> Please ask the ECON Committee to oppose Amendments ALT A and ALT G. \n> \n> This is important for the future of renewable, energy innovations and energy independence in Europe\n> \n> Kind regards\n\n**Here is the complete list of all German member emails, just copy paste:**\n\nchristine.anderson@europarl.europa.eu, rasmus.andresen@europarl.europa.eu, katarina.barley@europarl.europa.eu, gunnar.beck@europarl.europa.eu, nicola.beer@europarl.europa.eu, hildegard.bentele@europarl.europa.eu, larspatrick.berg@europarl.europa.eu, stefan.berger@europarl.europa.eu, gabriele.bischoff@europarl.europa.eu, michael.bloss@europarl.europa.eu, damian.BOESELAGER@europarl.europa.eu, patrick.breyer@europarl.europa.eu, markus.buchheit@europarl.europa.eu, klaus.buchner@europarl.europa.eu, udo.bullmann@europarl.europa.eu, delara.burkhardt@europarl.europa.eu, martin.buschmann@europarl.europa.eu, reinhard.buetikofer@europarl.europa.eu, daniel.caspary@europarl.europa.eu, anna.cavazzini@europarl.europa.eu, oezlem.demirel@europarl.europa.eu, anna.deparnay-grunenberg@europarl.europa.eu, christian.doleschal@europarl.europa.eu, lena.duepont@europarl.europa.eu, christian.ehler@europarl.europa.eu, cornelia.ernst@europarl.europa.eu, engin.eroglu@europarl.europa.eu, ismail.ertug@europarl.europa.eu, markus.ferber@europarl.europa.eu, nicolaus.fest@europarl.europa.eu, romeo.franz@europarl.europa.eu, daniel.freund@europarl.europa.eu, michael.gahler@europarl.europa.eu, evelyne.gebhardt@europarl.europa.eu, alexandra.geese@europarl.europa.eu, jens.geier@europarl.europa.eu, helmut.geuking@europarl.europa.eu, sven.giegold@europarl.europa.eu, jens.gieseke@europarl.europa.eu, andreas.glueck@europarl.europa.eu, svenja.hahn@europarl.europa.eu, henrike.hahn@europarl.europa.eu, martin.haeusling@europarl.europa.eu, niclas.herbst@europarl.europa.eu, pierrette.herzberger-fofana@europarl.europa.eu, monika.hohlmeier@europarl.europa.eu, peter.jahr@europarl.europa.eu, petra.kammerevert@europarl.europa.eu, ska.keller@europarl.europa.eu, moritz.koerner@europarl.europa.eu, dietmar.koester@europarl.europa.eu, maximilian.krah@europarl.europa.eu, constanze.krehl@europarl.europa.eu, joachim.kuhs@europarl.europa.eu, sergey.lagodinsky@europarl.europa.eu, bernd.lange@europarl.europa.eu, katrin.langensiepen@europarl.europa.eu, peter.liese@europarl.europa.eu, sylvia.limmer@europarl.europa.eu, norbert.lins@europarl.europa.eu, david.mcallister@europarl.europa.eu, erik.marquardt@europarl.europa.eu, joerg.meuthen@europarl.europa.eu, martina.michels@europarl.europa.eu, marlene.mortler@europarl.europa.eu, ulrike.mueller@europarl.europa.eu, hannah.neumann@europarl.europa.eu, norbert.neuser@europarl.europa.eu, angelika.niebler@europarl.europa.eu, niklas.nienass@europarl.europa.eu, maria.noichl@europarl.europa.eu, jutta.paulus@europarl.europa.eu, markus.pieper@europarl.europa.eu, dennis.radtke@europarl.europa.eu, guido.reil@europarl.europa.eu, terry.reintke@europarl.europa.eu, martin.schirdewan@europarl.europa.eu, christine.schneider@europarl.europa.eu, helmut.scholz@europarl.europa.eu, sven.schulze@europarl.europa.eu, joachim.schuster@europarl.europa.eu, andreas.schwab@europarl.europa.eu, ralf.seekatz@europarl.europa.eu, nico.semsrott@europarl.europa.eu, sven.simon@europarl.europa.eu, birgit.sippel@europarl.europa.eu, martin.sonneborn@europarl.europa.eu, sabine.verheyen@europarl.europa.eu, viola.voncramon@europarl.europa.eu, axel.voss@europarl.europa.eu, marionerika.walsmann@europarl.europa.eu, manfred.weber@europarl.europa.eu, rainer.wieland@europarl.europa.eu, tiemo.woelken@europarl.europa.eu, bernhard.zimniok@europarl.europa.eu",

From the elliptical math, to the difficulty adjustment, the elegant simplicity was many decades worth of seemingly unrelated work that composed. Whoever was bitcoin's main contributor was almost certainly quite old, had likely done Nobel quality work since his genius was discovered at an early age, and had an excellent cross-discipline understanding of economics, mathematics, game theory, and cryptography. He already had money, he already must've had recognition too, and was far too old for any of it to matter. That's just my opinion, but the Nobel quality work that went into bitcoin makes cheap script protocols (and their founders who are happy to bask in the limelight and hold the microphone) look like $3 steaks, just embarrassing.",

To transact on lightning, you simply exchange non-broadcasted transactions with each other signatures which are redeemable on the blockchain at any moment. But until the channel remains open, your funds will remain locked in that 2 of 2 multisig. That\u00b4s basically why you can be equivalent to staking, especially because if you have several lightning channels open and you are forwarding transactions between them, you can take a small fee. (You don\u00b4t have tto, for example I charge 0 for routing payments as I want to help the network.)\n\nI think once you undertstand fully the underlying workings of LN, you will be able answer your own questions, here is a great video that might help:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKdK-7AtAMQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKdK-7AtAMQ)\n\nOr if you are more of a book person, you can selectively read [Mastering the Lightning Network by Antonopoulos](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook)",

Lightning Network does not yet support taproot. It's not even in any BOLTs, let alone implemented in actual LN clients. There are years worth of work ahead until this changes.\n2. Public channels have their funding txid announced in the gossip, which is public (and is publicly inspectable, e.g. on 1ML or Amboss). Even with taproot, your public channel funding txid is permanently linked to your LN node and it will be 100% obvious that txo is a Lightning Network channel.\n3. If at any time both channel parties have owned at least 1% of the channel funds, then channel closing will *always* give *both* parties an output. If you close your channel and your channel peer subsequently uses their output from the channel to fund a new public channel, **even private channel funding txes will be identifiable as a LN channel**.\n\n\n\nAlso:\n\n > The Lightning Network does not increase the privacy of payment, it makes payments 100% private. Absolutely and unequivocally private. End of.\n\nAgain completely untrue. Payments are routed across the network as HTLCs, which requires that each LN node along the route sees the same payment hash with an ever-decreasing payment amount (as fees get deducted along the way) and CLTV (lock time). This makes it very easy to trace transactions across the network, and leaks lots of information that can be used to deduce payment source/destination, e.g. `cltv_expiry`s on incoming HTLCs, round payment amounts, timing of payment attempts, and more.\n\nWhen taproot is properly implemented in LN (some years away) it will be possible to upgrade from HTLCs to PTLCs, which do not have the same problem with shared payment hashes. That will significantly improve LN payments privacy, but it does not solve all the problems I described here.\n\n**LN payments privacy is way better than on-chain txes but VERY far from \"absolutely and unequivocally private\"!**\n\n>  What in essence you have done is an ad hoc CoinJoin which severs the relationship between your KYC account and your Bitcoin. (As along as you do not use the same address as you opened the channel with, it goes without saying).\n\nCompletely untrue. Again, both channel peers will get one output from the channel closing tx. Regardless of what address *you* use, when *your peer* subsequently spends their UTXO--e.g. to fund a new channel from their node--it will be 100% clear who owns which UTXO. This is **not** a CoinJoin and does **not** provide the same privacy benefit. Even if it did, a CoinJoin with only one other party gives very little privacy benefit.",

[...] it's literally all there in Chapter 10 of Mastering the Lightning Network.\n\nYou should read that book more carefully and try operating a routing node for a few months. Please keep in mind that while the sphinx padded payload scheme makes it *possible* to obscure the total route length and where you (the routing node forwarding an HTLC) lie along the route, it does not totally obscure all information that can reveal the source and/or destination of the HTLC. I'll explain in more detail:\n\n\n1. `cltv_expiry`. Each HTLC along the route has a corresponding expiry blocktime, called `cltv_expiry` (see [this section](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/develop/10_onion_routing.asciidoc#update_add_htlc) of the chapter you linked). Each channel has a `cltv_expiry_delta` which varies widely; my node shows the most common values are 40 (~121k channels), 144 (~12k channels), and 34 (~7500 channels). Finally, each node has a `min_final_cltv_expiry` that it encodes into the invoice, typically 19. I believe it's possible for the sender to fuzz the CLTV expiry values, but I am not aware of any implementation that does. This means that if you forward an HTLC with an outgoing `cltv_expiry` of 19 (blocks relative to the current longest chain), you can be quite sure the next node is the destination. If you forward an HTLC with an outgoing `cltv_expiry` of 53 (relative), you can be reasonably confident the next node is one channel hop away from the destination, with that channel having `cltv_expiry_delta` of 34.\n2. Round payment amounts. If I forward an HTLC that sends exactly 100000000msat to the next node, I can be quite sure that the next node is the payment destination. This has nothing to do with how the packets are routed--your payment amount can itself leak information about the destination.\n3. Timing. It takes time to forward HTLCs across nodes, but no LN implementation [does anything to prevent timing correlation attacks](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/5288). If you send me an HTLC, I fail it, then get a new HTLC from you very quickly (say, 0.1s), I can be very sure that you're the payment source. Similarly, if I forward an HTLC to you, and get the preimage back very quickly (say, 0.1s), I can be very sure that you're the payment destination. This vulnerability was treated in more depth by Elias Rohrer and Florian Tschorsch in [their paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12143.pdf). The money quote: \"We find that controlling a small number malicious nodes is sufficient to observe a large share of all payments, emphasizing the relevance of the on-path adversary model. Moreover, we show that adversaries of different magnitudes could employ timing-based attacks to deanonymize payment endpoints with high precision and recall.\"\n4. Other ways. If I see repeated incoming HTLCs with the same payment hash coming from my channel with you, I know you are likely the source of the payment. Timing information can provide further confirmation.\n\n> The only way that payments could be traceable as you describe would be if nodes start collaborating and colluding together and exchanging information. Almost all nodes are pseudonymous with no contact information attached to them, so this would completely unfeasible in practice. \n\nThe pseudonymous nature makes it easier to [Sybil attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack). A single entity can run multiple nodes. Chainalysis has likely spun up many ostensibly-independent LN nodes just to increase their chance of lying on a payment path and gathering information in at least the ways I've described and probably more.\n\n\nI'm sorry to be so negative, but you frankly do not have a deep enough understanding of the Lightning Network and you haven't given this issue nearly sufficient thought to make extremely bold and *dangerous* statements like, \"it makes payments 100% private.  Absolutely and unequivocally private.\"",

You will pay slightly higher routing fees than if you had your own node, but other than that, there is no difference whatsoever. Download Muun wallet, and I'll send you some sats to show you.",

However, Lapps don't usually suffer from this because they are usually sending 1 sat with encrypted messages, so 1 sat almost always get transferred. And if a business wants to accept lightning, it's their responsibility to make sure they are well-connected, and simply by connecting to a few of the largest nodes on the network they won't face this issue.

Ethereum started with a 72 million ETH premine, but that doesn't mean people can't make money with it. A lot of people even made money with bitconnect, dogecoin, and shiba inu lol so as long as suckers keep buying it then the price can keep going up. Institutional investors have no interest in ETH and [this report titled \"An Investor's Take on Cryptoassets\" details why](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor's+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf). That report even explains that when the fees get too high and things don't go as planned, users will (and are) switch to a different cryptocurrency. You can already see this happening right now with all of the \"eth killers.\" That report also explains what makes BTC attractive to them.\n\nOver 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as Bitcoin. Satoshi created Bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without the trust or permission of anyone else. Bitcoin had no premine, no developer fund, no developer tax, and no leader. Satoshi never sold, made no profit, got no fame for his real identity, removed himself from the project, and he gave a two month heads up about before he launched Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized and trustless with the full nodes in control of the protocol, and it has no leader or company leading it.\n \nCryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. People use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their Bitcoin stack or even their Ethereum stack if they don't understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Gambling on altcoins can still be very profitable during a bull run, but making a profit is not guaranteed and you can easily lose BTC when gambling on altcoins. \n\nSatoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that Bitcoin was launched fairly:\n\n* No premine (Satoshi didn\u2019t grant himself any coins)\n\n* Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network (no sudden release and no mining before release)\n\n* Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely (it's not even possible for an altcoin to replicate this)\n\n* Satoshi never cashed out (unlike every altcoin founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)\n\nEthereum launched with 12 million ETH for the developers, and 60 million ETH for sale as an \"initial coin offering\" during the presale. They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine and ignoring the 60 million that they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after Ethereum developers and the Ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security, because that's what it is according to the [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp).\n\n[Here is a clip of Joseph Lubin describing how they allowed whales to use multiple fake identities to buy as much ETH as they wanted during the Ethereum presale.](https://i.imgur.com/HpBR7C5.mp4) \"A person can buy with any number of different identities. We may limit the unit size of a single sale to make it easier to disguise. So that nobody scares people with an enormous initial purchase.

Ethereum started with a 72 million ETH premine, but that doesn't mean people can't make money with it. A lot of people even made money with bitconnect, dogecoin, and shiba inu lol so as long as suckers keep buying it then it can keep going up. Institutional investors have no interest in it and [this report](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor's+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf) details why. It even explains that when the fees get too high and things don't go as planned, users will (and are) switch to a different cryptocurrency. You can already see this happening right now with all of the \"eth killers.\"\n\nOver 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as Bitcoin. Satoshi created Bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without the trust or permission of anyone else. Bitcoin had no premine, no developer fund, no developer tax, and no leader. Satoshi never sold, made no profit, got no fame for his real identity, removed himself from the project, and he gave a two month heads up about before he launched Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized and trustless with the full nodes in control of the protocol, and it has no leader or company leading it.\n \nCryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. People use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their Bitcoin stack or even their Ethereum stack if they don't understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Gambling on altcoins can still be very profitable during a bull run, but making a profit is not guaranteed and you can easily lose Bitcoin when gambling on altcoins. \n\nSatoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that Bitcoin was launched fairly:\n\n* No premine (Satoshi didn\u2019t grant himself any coins)\n\n* Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network (no sudden release and no mining before release)\n\n* Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely (it's not even possible for an altcoin to replicate this)\n\n* Satoshi never cashed out (unlike every altcoin founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)\n\nEthereum launched with 12 million ETH for the developers, and 60 million ETH for sale as an \"initial coin offering.\" They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine and ignoring the 60 million that they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after Ethereum developers and the Ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security, because that's what it is according to the [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp).\n\nJust a few days ago the Chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler, even said that several cryptocurrencies are actually non-compliant seucurities. And Ethereum is one the two cryptocurrencies that the SEC is first focusing on. Even though etherians always say that the SEC said it's not a security.

Ethereum started with a 72 million ETH premine, but that doesn't mean people can't make money with it. A lot of people even made money with bitconnect, dogecoin, and shiba inu lol so as long as suckers keep buying it then it can keep going up. Institutional investors have no interest in it and [this report](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor's+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf) details why. It even explains that when the fees get too high and things don't go as planned, users will (and are) switch to a different cryptocurrency. You can already see this happening right now with all of the \"eth killers.\"\n\nOver 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as Bitcoin. Satoshi created Bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without the trust or permission of anyone else. Bitcoin had no premine, no developer fund, no developer tax, and no leader. Satoshi never sold, made no profit, got no fame for his real identity, removed himself from the project, and he gave a two month heads up about before he launched Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized and trustless with the full nodes in control of the protocol, and it has no leader or company leading it.\n \nCryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. People use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their Bitcoin stack or even their Ethereum stack if they don't understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Gambling on altcoins can still be very profitable during a bull run, but making a profit is not guaranteed and you can easily lose Bitcoin when gambling on altcoins. \n\nSatoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that Bitcoin was launched fairly:\n\n* No premine (Satoshi didn\u2019t grant himself any coins)\n\n* Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network (no sudden release and no mining before release)\n\n* Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely (it's not even possible for an altcoin to replicate this)\n\n* Satoshi never cashed out (unlike every altcoin founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)\n\nEthereum launched with 12 million ETH for the developers, and 60 million ETH for sale as an \"initial coin offering.\" They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine and ignoring the 60 million that they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after Ethereum developers and the Ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security, because that's what it is according to the [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp).\n\nJust a few days ago the Chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler, even said that several cryptocurrencies are actually non-compliant seucurities. And Ethereum is one the two cryptocurrencies that the SEC is first focusing on. Even though etherians always say that the SEC said it's not a security. But they've really already disregarded that previous claim made by Bill Hinman, former director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance, who suggested that offers and sales of ETH are not securities transactions. Gary Gensler, the current Chair of the SEC, has now said that \"a lot of crypto tokens, I won't call them cryptocurrencies for this moment, are indeed non-compliant securities.\"\n\nVitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot and he knew better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to investors. Another example is pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETH, now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but \"rich statefulness.\" \n\n[Gregory Maxwell: \u201cVitalik Buterin Ran A Quantum Computer Scam\u201d](http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/08/17/gregory-maxwell-vitalik-buterin-ran-quantum-computer-scam/)\n\n[Quantum Computing and Bitcoin with Vitalik Buterin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkUpZkeqhF4)\n\n[Vitalik\u2019s Quantum Scam](https://medium.com/bitcoinerrorlog/vitaliks-quantum-quest-9e6af6570f23)\n\nThe Ethereum community has endorsed radical changes and pivots, trying to find narrative fit and the Ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit. They've literally tried world computer, dapps, crowdfunding, NFTs, DeFi, open finance, radical markets, store of value, and more. Ethereum is an aggregator of these narratives, trying each one out over the years in an attempt to seduce people that are uneducated about cryptocurrency. But there is no persistence of a singular narrative when it comes to Ethereum and they are still trying to find product market fit even after all this time.\n\nEthereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. What purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems? They also advertised immutability and unstoppable contracts that were then immediately reversed with multiple hard forks. \n\nUnlike Ethereum, Bitcoin's inflation distribution rate and maximum supply are clearly defined and they will never change. The inflation distribution rate and final algo of Ethereum is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and it basically amounts to faith in Vitalik and his team. While at the same time newbies are misled into believing that Ethereum is decentralized. Meanwhile, Vitalik has full control over the whole project. Do you even remember the DAO contract? Someone found a way to drain ETH and some of Vitalik's buddies lost a ton of ETH, so he rolled back the entire blockchain because Ethereum is centralized, Vitalik is the leader of it and everyone in the Ethereum community agrees with him and he can do whatever he wants. He chose to change the name of the real Ethereum blockchain to Ethereum classic and calls his rolled back blockchain Ethereum. Not long ago ETH miners said they weren't going to follow Vitalik into adding a ponzi style transaction fee burn, so Vitalik, leader of Ethereum, called their consensus a 51% attack and changed the rules. Vitalik can only control Ethereum because it's centralized.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has switched over to staking rewards also has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your ETH being staked will expose users to legal tax obligations. Exchanges for example must send a 1099-MISC to the IRS on behalf of any American user earning $600 in a year. Proof-of-Stake also makes it so the already rich whales control the network and will be collecting compounding interest to dump on the open market.\n\nEthereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch and I have no expectation that the new Ethereum will be any more successful than the current one. This can only be done because Ethereum is centralized. Ethereum 2 will still be a centralized scamcoin controlled and ran by scammers.  \n\n[Vitalik is already laying the groundwork for some more hype and suggesting a re-brand to Ethereum 3.0!](https://i.imgur.com/mxIzBYK.mp4)\n\nEthereum scam part 1 - [Here we focus on the Ethereum token pre-sale which to anyone with any financial experience, is an obvious sale of an unlicensed unregistered security.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUVlatCvp0)\n\nEthereum scam part 2 - [Here we take a look at the value & business proposition of Decentralized Smart Contracts and why it's one of the dumbest ways to make your business more efficient.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCiHTJRbIf4)\n\nEthereum scam part 3 - [The Ethereum scam part 3.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgFXqVpGDNg)\n\nhttps://medium.com/startup-grind/i-was-wrong-about-ethereum-804c9a906d36\n\n[Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are Scams and so are the developers that build on them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtVLjCxPDU)",

It's like watching TV, but without the TV.  \n\nSit still, in a room without interruptions (you might sit in the shower if your home is full of interruptions/other people/noises).  \n\nFocus on one thing.  Some like to stare at candle flame.  I like to close my eyes and listen to the sound of the shower water.  \n\nLet your thoughts go silent.  This part can take a few days to learn, or maybe you'll get it right away.  Focus on your \"one thing\" and be silent inside.  If you find yourself thinking about anything else, just let it go.  It's okay, keep letting it go.  It becomes easy within a few days.  If there's a song in your head, let it go.  If it comes back, let it go.  Focus on your one thing.  \n\nBreathe all the way in, then exhale fully and slowly.  As you exhale, relax your muscles.  Some people like to start by relaxing their feet, ankles, legs... face, scalp, or the reverse.  Keep taking deep breaths.  Keep relaxing, keep your focus on your \"one thing\".  \n\nThat's it.\n\nSit down, breathe, relax, focus...  It is important to do this every day for several days.  You'll see what I mean.  You'll eventually find yourself in a wonderful, blissful state - your breathing will automatically be very deep, you'll be more relaxed than you knew was possible.  Your ability to focus will increase.  \n\nSo, how does this help you to not spend/sell your Bitcoin?  When you feel the urge, you'll be able to sit down, take a deep breath, relax, and focus on your \"one thing\" (even if you have to imagine its there).  That is, over time, you will replace your bad habit/thought-pattern with something healthy.  \n\nIt's called the Relaxation Response.  You condition yourself to relax.  \n\nPrice of Bitcoin changes a lot, deep breath, relax, nobody is going to harm you, not even you.  \n\nThis ability, as you'll find, comes in handy in all kinds of situations.  \n\nThing is, you can't start learning to relax while you're in a stress situation -- you must learn to relax in a controlled environment, and then learn to use it in other situations.",

Here is my advice.\n\n1. Make a written plan. I am doing X for Y reasons. Z is my goal. Print this out. Carry this in your pocket. It will make you think before you spend money. \n2. Goals=lifestyle. Having tons of btc and living a life you don't like won't work. Personally my goal is not to have a lambo-it's to have investments that can generate 7,000 month income without touching the principle. That is what keeps me focused.\n3. Your goals should be realistic and I believe being the goal is freedom younger. I'd rather be kind of rich at 42 then really rich at 50. I'm 38. I know 42 year olds who cannot get their time back. Time and freedom is everything. I know people with tons of $ but no plan-you need to have an exit strategy for yourself-this doesn't mean sell-it means a plan. .\n4. Have rewards in your plan-have one vice. Traveling, clothes you like, restaurants, partying-have one vice. Embrace your reward and enjoy life within reason. I know someone who makes $250k a year, has no family, has no vices, and looks at his bank account for happiness. Not a good plan. I also know that the longer I prevented myself from enjoying some wealth the more I would binge.\n5. Trading is very difficult. I have bought options and still once in a while do. Overall it's lost me money. The ultimate trade was buying houses and selling before the crash then rebuying between 09-11. I know ZERO people who did this. Be wary of people who tell trading stories.\n6. There is nothing wrong with exploring trading, but I'd keep it at 5% of your net worth. Assume trading goes to zero and be okay with that.",

Taproot indeed enables much simpler scriptless scripts (=script-like things that can be done without scripts) than what was possible before. They can also be done more privately (without revealing e.g. fallback clauses that still need real scripts).\n\n> which can allow for turing complete smart contracts\n\nNo, Bitcoin script is not turing-complete. Scriptless scripts also don't really permit doing anything that wasn't possible with script; they just permit a number of specific things to be done without using script at all.\n\n> to be built on top of the lightning network.\n\nThat's unrelated. The lightning network is a payment settlement network. It *uses* scripts (or scriptless scripts). Certainly things can be built on top of LN too, but it's hard to see how on-chain script rule changes would affect things there.\n\n> So for example we can have decentralised autonomous organisations   \nrunning on top of lightning, and because they run on top of lightning   \ninstead of on the main chain there are no scalability issues as is the   \ncase with ethereum.\n\nThere are lots of possible developments that could enable powerful things to be built, but that's more related to changes *in* bitcoin script (e.g. more powerful opcodes) than taproot (which mostly changes *how* scripts are written, not what they can do) or schnorr (which makes it easier to do complicated things with signatures) or LN.",

If all parties agree, the money can be released however you want, everyone must sign the agreed transaction.\n2. The protocol must operate within the limits of the n-of-n address. If you have more money, then your partner has less.\n3. The protocol should practice atomicity: that is, any off chain activity must not be considered completed until all the steps are completed.\n4. Each atomic action must end with spend transactions that reflect the agreed final state of the address. (bob gets 1BTC, alice gets 0.5BTC)\n5. It is SUPER important that no one can get a valid signed transaction before someone else gets theirs because it would allow parties to hold each other's funds hostage. (We solved this for the Lightning protocol)\n\nThe protocol itself can be anything, as long as you make sure that even before funding the multi-sig address, that they have a signed transaction that will give them their money back, and the protocol creates new transactions that replace it along the way in a proper, trust minimised (trustless if possible -- LN is basically trustless), atomic way, you only need the people you want to start a funded contract with to agree on the protocol.\n\nI can't imagine my own protocol, but I understand that LN is so generic a protocol, it could just be the base layer that gives us more high level functions at L3 that people could imagine building on without being a rocket scientist first.\n\nSo it's not the same thing as what we have on ETH, but that's a good thing IMO. \n1. You gain privacy by not having the state of your contract open, \n2. you may not be able to add people ad-hoc onto your contract without some further on-chain activity, but that's also better than ETH where everything your contract does costs gas fees so its cheaper, \n3. It doesn't bloat the blockchain\n4. These smart contracts are not Bitcoin, just as they are not ETH, so you shouldn't trust a secondary protocol JUST because it runs on Bitcoin. This clear separation will make that more obvious.\n\nHoly shit, I've just reframed the LN network in my head. I initially thought of it as a network of channels, which it is, but you can also think of it as a network that you can join by creating a channel with somebody already on the network. I'm gonna chew on that.",

Quite frankly, I consider it to be unusable.\n\nStill, the MW coin payment protocol is not a scriptless script.\n\nIt is an experimental base-layer blockchain protocol.\n\nThere are lots of good ideas that emerged from this superb experiment and its whitepaper! The main experiment itself, however, has in my opinion not (yet) succeeded. \n\nThey manage to achieve other things that are very interesting. For example, they don't store history. That is a really good thing for privacy. However, we cannot just easily retrofit this feature back to the Bitcoin blockchain. Maybe one day we find a way to achieve the same effect of automatically dropping all stale history?\n\nIt is this particular experiment that encouraged Andrew Poelstra to figure out how to do scriptless scripting.

It just needs to know that the conditions are now met to authorize the payment.\n\nSo, how does it work in practice?\n\nYou organize the construction of a dealerless Shamir-secret-sharing-style common private key in which 2 of the 3 participants can reconstruct the complete secret. Next, the payer wires the funds to the address associated.\n\nFor example, Monero already implements exactly this. In fact, without scriptless script approach they could not support multi-signature because they do not support blockchain scripting.\n\nTheir solution is cryptographically perfectly secure.\n\nOriginally, I thought of their solution to be just a clever trick. A judicious workaround. Some kind smart hack.\n\nAs things now turn out to be, scriptless scripts are much more than that! Off-chain protocol design is truly superior to blockchain scripting. You can do a lot more with off-chain protocol design than with blockchain scripts. It is not just a workaround! \n\nWhat has happened is that unusual and experimental blockchains, that do not support scripting, have gradually and painstakingly turned their necessity into a virtue.",

This is accomplished by making Bitcoin's blockchain as lightweight as possible.\n\nThe more nodes there are on the network, the harder Bitcoin is to take down or manipulate. This is important because Bitcoin only acrues monetary premium from being extremely difficult to destroy and create (much like gold).\n\nBitcoin is, by far, the protocol for which it is easiest to spin up a full node. It needs nothing other than a Raspberry Pi 4 or an old laptop with a modest internet connection. All other protocols require nodes with higher bandwidth and processing power to achieve their stated aims (unless they are new or ghost chains that see little use).\n\nI should also mention that some projects twist the meaning of what a full node is to downplay this fact.\n\nIf you like, Bitcoin's strategy is to use the base chain to secure the most important monetary properties (such as scarcity) and not much else. Extra features like instant payments are offloaded from the main chain and onto second layers (such as Lightning).",

You can cryptographically check that eS truly signs message M, even though you do not know the encryption secret t.\n\neS is called an *adaptor signature*.\n\nSo, now you almost have the money.

There is no such thing as \"intrinsic value\".  This assumption has been a plague on economic theory since Marx.  Value is aligned with demonstrated preference.  Human preference is demonstrated through how they act.  For example, people have demonstrated a preference for bitcoin over other uses of capital such as going to a movie.  The other uses to which the capital could have been put are the opportunity costs.  Value is a personal hierarchy of wants.  By demonstrating preference for bitcoin over the dollar (you purchased the bitcoin right?... and not something else) you value bitcoin higher than the dollar.  You \"value\" the bitcoin higher than the dollar.  \n\nThe reason bitcoin is succeeding is because individuals prefer bitcoin against the dollar.  This trend is growing and that is the primary reason bitcoin will replace the dollar.  It just works better to satisfy ends than the dollar does.",

The nation state as an organizational unit made sense from the 1600s up to the early 1990s when there was no Internet (and even then they were often run by corrupt, murderous psychopaths).

Before P2TR, we've always had two distinct script constructions for \"simple payments\" and \"advanced scripts\" (first P2PKH and P2SH, later P2WPKH and P2WSH). Even as a \"simple payments\" user, this reveals some information gratuitously to the world: the fact that you're not doing something more advanced (e.g. not multisig, not Lightning, not ...). It's a minor point, but I believe it counts, especially as more and more on-chain usage is related to more advanced constructions, it's important to not let the world know exactly what you are doing. P2TR merges these two into one output type that is usable (and efficient) for both, and even when they are spent, they often remain indistinguishable.\n\nOf course, it needs to be said that P2TR is different from P2PKH/P2SH/P2WPKH/P2WSH, and the introduction of a new address/output type does mean you're now revealing that you're using taproot. That's only a temporary effect, and one has a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem: while most usage is pre-P2TR, switching to it is something of a reduction too.",

But lots of people want to sell puts and there are comparatively few buyers like you, so I think you'll not have a ton of trouble buying some if that's what you want. I'd put in limit buy orders at reasonable prices on the strike/expiries you're interested in, and with a bit of patience the orders will probably get filled :)",

See the way off-chain smart contracts work is we create transactions for a shared address (multi-sig) to a script address that puts conditions on the final settlement to ensure that there is time (a timelock) to react if there is any fraud identified between parties of the contract. We call this update transactions and the final withdrawal of funds is called a settlement transaction.\n\nUntil now, it has been inconvenient to make an update transaction on top of another on top of another, because if I broadcast an old update transaction, then the script transaction will have a clause that says: \"the next update transaction will take precidence over any settlement transaction\". The problem is that if there are 10 more update transactions, you need to broadcast all of them in order, each costing a miner fee.\n\nThe current Lightning protocol got around this by just implementing \"penalty transactions\" that basically just said: If you have proof that the update tx broadcast isn't the latest, then just let the victim withdraw everything. It's a big hammer solution.\n\n\nEdit: changed the word Taproot to Eltoo here because I was mistaken:\nEltoo (an upgrade that I expect will be coming to bitcoin in the next few years) will enable us to change the update transactions, changing \"I will give precidence to the next update transaction\" into \"I will give precidence to any update transaction newer than this\". That means we only need to broadcast the last update transaction to fix the situation, we don't need to publish every update transaction between the old and the new.\n\nWhen we don't have penalties, we can start to do contracts between more than just 2 people (penalties don't work if only one person can claim the rewards in a group of 2 victims out of 3 parties).\n\nMy point is that these updates coming will make smart contracts smarter and cheaper, but we could always TECHNICALLY do them; it just wasn't very economical to do it until now. Hope this makes you bullish, it makes me super bullish.",

The hard part of isn\u2019t coming up with a better technology or simply the act of creating it, the hard part is getting people to adopt it and trust it. The problem is, as much as everyone wants to say that ethereum is the coin with the most utility, the reality is that\u2019s at odds with the numbers. The facts are the bulk of ethereum is not being transacted, but instead held for its speculative potential. To make matters worse for ethereum, the percentage of bitcoin being transacted, out of the total supply of bitcoin, is much much more than ethereum. This really flies in the face of the whole \u201cbitcoin is speculative while ethereum actually has utility\u201d narratives. The reality is the actual numbers show the opposite. The numbers show that much more ethereum is stagnant and not being used to transact value compared to bitcoin. This is where the \u201cutility super contract bla bla\u201d vapor ware story starts to break down. I\u2019ll admit it sounds good and the website is remarkable polished, but at the end of the day ethereums biggest success is it\u2019s marketing. The reality is everyone holding ethereum has one thing in common. They\u2019re waiting for the smart contract super highway to finally whisk them away towards neverland, but not a single one of them is actually USING ethereum. I hope more Americans wake up to this troubling issue because I think the world will be waiting a long time. Not to mention the long term negative effects on society which PoS would have. That\u2019s if they could ever successfully implement PoS though. If you haven\u2019t noticed they keep kicking the can down the road. \n\nHonestly ethereum is being run like a political campaign.

This practice didn't stop, of course, because it was so easy to get this \"extra\" money so they continued the practice for about 300 years, until the coin was essentially worthless.\n\nSound familiar? It should.

I do not believe bitcoin fits the definition of #1, in fact it's quite the opposite. That's what fiat fits the definition of.\n2. Yes, buying bitcoin can have a high risk of loss if trading (which only a few can resist the pull of), especially over a time frame under 3 years.\n\nBitcoin went under 5k last year...but...there have been no dca holders who have bought over the last 3 years, hell even 4 years at the top of 17, who are at a loss. For the people who fomo'd in or simply started at 60k, yes, right now they are at a loss.\n\nWhat makes bitcoin, in the long term, go up? To me, it's NOT the dollar. It's central bank balance sheets, social unrest/wealth inequality, and digitization.\n\nRight now bitcoin is not going up to the old levels because the stimulus bills are a maybe. Sounds like Manchin will not sign off. This means MUCH less central bank balance sheet expansion (still expanding, but slower).\n\nGo to zero? No. This has been said for the last decade. \n\n90% of people in Academia, Central Planning, or the old system will say no out of ignorance or fear. I have yet to find someone who has spent 5-10 hours educating themselves and asking questions about bitcoin who says it's still going to zero. I do hear these arguments from ignorant people. Remember ignorant doesn't mean evil-it means undecuated.\n\nThe way I see it is that it's accumulation time. Getting to two coins makes one, imho, very wealthy in the new world. Crypto is here to stay. Janet Yellen is nearly dead, is incompetent or pure evil, and will fight this till she croaks. She would ban it if she could. She can't. The next decade will see mass adoption.",

You gotta realize the sentiment and fear would be horrific at that point. Everyone would be expecting it to get to zero.

It\u2019s kind of a wasteland at the moment. People are too narcissistic and brainwashed to be challenged by anyone, so people downvote anything that makEs them uncomfortable.\n\nThis sideways action is just consolidation in a range. Nothing to get sad or excited about. The longer it goes on the more explosive the decision will be. \nIf I had to guess we will get rallies through the 45-47k and to around 52k area max mid year before the end of the year, then a recession of some sort with a heavy correction. \n\nThis is pretty much what the data says.

Now we are so far in debt, we won't be able to service the debt once interest rates rise, and interest rates are bound to rise with the higher inflation we are now facing, and (2) Back in the 70's when we had nominal inflation around 12%, you could earn 7% interest on cash you held in bank savings/MM accounts, so really you were only losing about 5% of purchasing power annually to inflation.  Today we have true inflation > 10% (officially 8.5%) but you earn 0.002% interest on your cash accounts.  So the situation today is actually worse for your average household.",

I had ideas about creating my own coin, to solve the 'proof of work is inefficient' \"problem\" with bitcoin.\n\nI have P and NP tattooed on m wrists. These are famous computational complexity classes, the subject of an open question in theoretical computer science (does P = NP?) and, i think, one of the most interesting questions people have ever asked.   I was obsessed with this question for a long time, hence the tattoos.\n\nI had really been excited about the possibility of building a coin that might 'solve' the problem using a clever workaround: build a database of solutions to NP complete problems.   It seemed so poetic, i was in love with the idea. I _had_ to do it. But of course i didn't want to rip off a bunch of people who were investing in what might not work. So i had to first confirm to my satisfaction that i could actually deliver this thing.\n\nSo i started looking into bitcoin even more, to better understand exactly how it works. How does block difficulty adjustment work? How are the nodes agreeing on how much to adjust the difficulty? What exactly prevents different attacks on the longest chain from succeeding?  _why_ does proof of work actually work?\n\nAnd eventually it became clear that even though i previously _thought_ i understood bitcoin, i really hadn't.  I hadn't gotten just how tightly it all fits together, and how removing any one piece of the design - like the requirement that you can't start work on block n+1 until you have full knowledge of block n - makes the whole thing fall apart.\n\nAt that point i went full maxi.",

But it would still be a centralized scam even if it was created without the massive 72 million ETH premine. \n\nEthereum started with a 72 million ETH premine, but that doesn't mean people can't make money with it. A lot of people even made money with bitconnect, dogecoin, and shiba inu... So as long as suckers keep buying ETH then its price can keep going up. But institutional investors have no interest in ETH and [this report titled \"An Investor's Take on Cryptoassets\" details why](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor's+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf). That report even explains that when the fees get too high and things don't go as planned, users will (and are) switch to a different cryptocurrency. You can already see this happening right now with all of the \"ETH killers.\" That report also explains what makes BTC attractive to them.\n\n[Click here and listen to a few minutes of Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song talk about Ethereum and Vitalik.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&t=47m24s) \n\nJimmy worked directly with Vitalik from the beginning, back when Vitalik was still working on rootstock for Bitcoin.\n\nOver 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as Bitcoin. Satoshi created Bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without the trust or permission of anyone else. Bitcoin had no premine, no developer fund, no developer tax, and no leader. Satoshi never sold, made no profit, got no fame for his real identity, removed himself from the project, and he gave a two month heads up about before he launched Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized and trustless with the full nodes in control of the protocol, and it has no leader or company leading it.\n \nCryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. People use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their Bitcoin stack or even their Ethereum stack if they don't understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Gambling on altcoins can still be very profitable during a bull run, but making a profit is not guaranteed and you can easily lose BTC when gambling on altcoins. \n\nSatoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that Bitcoin was launched fairly:\n\n* No premine (Satoshi didn\u2019t grant himself any coins)\n\n* Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network (no sudden release and no mining before release)\n\n* Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely (it's not even possible for an altcoin to replicate this)\n\n* Satoshi never cashed out (unlike every altcoin founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)\n\nEthereum launched with 12 million ETH for the developers, and 60 million ETH for sale as an \"initial coin offering\" during the presale. They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine and ignoring the 60 million that they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after Ethereum developers and the Ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security, because that's what it is according to the [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp).\n\n[Here is a clip of Joseph Lubin describing how they allowed whales to use multiple fake identities to buy as much ETH as they wanted during the Ethereum presale.](https://i.imgur.com/HpBR7C5.mp4) \"A person can buy with any number of different identities. We may limit the unit size of a single sale to make it easier to disguise. So that nobody scares people with an enormous initial purchase. If you are a whale and you plan on investing several million US dollars worth, then you can do so with with multiple identities.\"\n\nVitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot and he knew better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to investors. Another example is pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETH, now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but \"rich statefulness.\" \n\n[Gregory Maxwell: \u201cVitalik Buterin Ran A Quantum Computer Scam\u201d](http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/08/17/gregory-maxwell-vitalik-buterin-ran-quantum-computer-scam/)\n\n[Quantum Computing and Bitcoin with Vitalik Buterin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkUpZkeqhF4)\n\n[Vitalik\u2019s Quantum Scam](https://medium.com/bitcoinerrorlog/vitaliks-quantum-quest-9e6af6570f23)\n\nThe Ethereum community has endorsed radical changes and pivots, trying to find narrative fit and the Ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit. They've literally tried world computer, dapps, crowdfunding, NFTs, DeFi, open finance, radical markets, store of value, and more. Ethereum is an aggregator of these narratives, trying each one out over the years in an attempt to seduce people that are uneducated about cryptocurrency. But there is no persistence of a singular narrative when it comes to Ethereum and they are still trying to find product market fit even after all this time.\n\nEthereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. What purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems? They also advertised immutability and unstoppable contracts that were then immediately reversed with multiple hard forks. \n\nUnlike Ethereum, Bitcoin's inflation rate and maximum supply are clearly defined and they will never change. Ethereum's inflation rate, maximum supply, and final algo are not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and it basically amounts to faith in Vitalik and his team. While at the same time newbies are misled into believing that Ethereum is decentralized. Meanwhile, Vitalik has full control over the whole project. Does anybody else here remember the DAO smart contract? Someone found a way to drain ETH and some of Vitalik's buddies lost a ton of ETH, so he rolled back the entire blockchain because Ethereum is centralized, Vitalik is the leader of it, and everyone in the Ethereum community agrees with him, so he can do whatever he wants with Ethereum. He chose to change the name of the real Ethereum blockchain to Ethereum Classic and calls his rolled back blockchain Ethereum. Not long ago ETH miners said they weren't going to follow Vitalik into adding a ponzi style transaction fee burn, so Vitalik, leader of Ethereum, called their consensus a 51% attack and changed the rules. \n\nThe fact that Ethereum has switched over to staking rewards also has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your ETH being staked will expose users to legal tax obligations. Exchanges for example must send a 1099-MISC to the IRS on behalf of any American user earning $600 in a year. Proof-of-Stake also makes it so the already rich whales control the network and will be collecting compounding interest to dump on the open market.\n\nEthereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch and I have no expectation that the new Ethereum will be any more successful than the current one. This can only be done because Ethereum is centralized. Ethereum 2 will still be a centralized scamcoin controlled and ran by scammers.  \n\n[Vitalik is already laying the groundwork for some more hype and suggesting a re-brand to Ethereum 3.0!](https://i.imgur.com/mxIzBYK.mp4)\n\nEthereum scam part 1 - [Here we focus on the Ethereum token pre-sale which to anyone with any financial experience, is an obvious sale of an unlicensed unregistered security.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUVlatCvp0)\n\nEthereum scam part 2 - [Here we take a look at the value & business proposition of Decentralized Smart Contracts and why it's one of the dumbest ways to make your business more efficient.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCiHTJRbIf4)\n\nEthereum scam part 3 - [The Ethereum scam part 3.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgFXqVpGDNg)\n\nhttps://medium.com/startup-grind/i-was-wrong-about-ethereum-804c9a906d36\n\n[Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are Scams and so are the developers that build on them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtVLjCxPDU)\n\n\"The Ethereum blockchain growing 85 terabytes per year is totally fine. If you have even one person that just keeps buying like a hundred dollar hard drive like I think once every month then they can store it.\" \u2013 Vitalik Buterin\n\nSource: https://i.imgur.com/1FZdLC5.mp4",

I didn't even get any party hats because I thought they were stupid. You used the party cracker on another player, and one of you would get the hat and one of you would get a random item of middling value... The hats of course developed their own economy, and were already the most expensive item in the game within a few short months.\n\nA couple of years later, someone found a way to duplicate the party crackers through a bug, so there was an explosion of new crackers and party hats on the scene. The bug was quickly patched, but still, I thought it was stupid so grabbed a couple for novelty, but sold them on pretty quickly, because they didn't have any 'intrinsic value' and I would rather spend my in game cash on weapons and armour.\n\nFast forward a few more years and the prices are outrageous. Annoyed with myself for being late to the party I resigned myself to get some damn party hats.\n\nI created a dueling character with a tricky name, with jacked up magic and created a very similar character that when you looked up the stats of the character on the public hiscore list you would see a character with shit magic stats , and tricked poor innocent people into staking their belongs to me. After 6 months of dirty in game behaviour, and a bit of trading, I had managed to get two full party hat sets, already worth hundreds of millions of GP.\n\nI loved the parallel, because now no one disputes the party hat economy. One day no one would dispute the bitcoin economy. Party hats are completely ubiquitous with Runescape, and last time I checked, those party hats would be worth actual real money in real life, somewhere to the tune of probably $100k USD for my full sets now.\n\nAlas, I didn't log on for over 15 years by the time you could cash in items for really money on a dark but authentic black market, my passwords long lost, and the credit cards I used to pay for membership from my mother, long forgotten. The email addresses I used, I don't even remember. Twenty years on, who knew that I'd actually spent hundreds of hours doing something that was worth real money. The fact I lost them, for my downright sneaky winning methods is a hilarious form of karma in a way.\n\nIf anyone has any idea how I would go about recovering those accounts, with literally no information but the usernames, let me know!",

So it's a shame for them to send people to Changelly and experience such awful things. I've asked Ledger in one of their Youtube video if they are aware that Changelly is problematic and screwing their customer and we should share the word that they are shady af and to not use their horrendous services. Let's hope you get your money back tomorrow tho, I feel positive that they will eventually give them back to you.",

Basically they are unsure what legal liability they are opening up to themselves by releasing your funds to you. It is insane that they don't make this clear before your transaction. But that would explain the insane long \"review\" time. I don't know if legal counsel could \"speed\" things up? But it would be pricy and possibly not resolve the situation quicker? I understand the situation sucks but from the way they have responded you it seems they are not intent on being helpful to you as a customer, but rather to themselves. \n\nMy reasoning for suspecting the above is because my friend applied for a service in his bank that has a review time of 10 weeks. Because he mentioned crypto in his application, the application was treated as having a potential high risk of money laundering liability, and has taken over 8 months to review because of long back logs.\n\nI don't know if any of this is useful information to you.

You should be able to tell them to refund you immediately if they can\u2019t verify you. \n\nEdit: I have sent a message to Nexo, Where I have a large sum of money, who deals with Changelly. Here is the message I sent. Hopefully this will help shine light on your problem.\n\n-I am concerned with your relationship with Changelly and the purchase of Nexo tokens. Although I haven\u2019t had any problems, this post is concerning to me. Until this, my only issue was the excessive fees they charge, but  this is VERY concerning to me. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/u04zex/changelly_kyc_scam_they_are_holding_my_19800_btc/-",

On their Twitter platform. On the BitcoinTalk forum. The crypto community must be protected from this pest of an exchange. Exchanges scamming with impunity should be outed publicly and community-wide to prevent them from stealing more assets and hurting crypto users.\n\nNext time OP, if you MUST use such an exchange, do it in small increments. Like $1k at a time even if it takes forever to complete the conversion to DAI.",

It's absolutely genius. I understand that the \"digital gold\" people are upset it wasn't yet another corporation who hodls Bitcoin on their balance sheet, but holy fuck are those people blind to how much bigger this is.\n\nEven I first underestimated the possible effect until someone who is actually affected by this as a merchant pointed out that the fee is 3% off the full price, but since the margin is probably always lower, it will be significantly more money the merchant gets by this. As an example, if the margin is 10%, then that means 30% more gains. This is so much, that they will go out of their way to make sure the customer uses LN and not credit cards anymore.\n\nThis has a decent chance to establish LN as the default payment network, and with it Bitcoin as the reserve currency because it's the native bearer asset. A lot of people don't see that and completely underestimate this move.",

Obviously, BTC can be compared to gold / silver, and fiat to brass:\n\n>*It has often struck our notice that the course our city runs*  \n>  \n>*Is the same towards men and money. She has true and worthy sons:*  \n>  \n>*She has good and ancient silver, she has good and recent gold.*  \n>  \n>*These are coins untouched with alloys; everywhere their fame is told;*  \n>  \n>*Not all Hellas holds their equal, not all Barbary far and near.*  \n>  \n>*Gold or silver, each well minted, tested each and ringing clear.*  \n>  \n>*Yet, we never use them! Others always pass from hand to hand.*  \n>  \n>*Sorry brass just struck last week and branded with a wretched brand.*\n\nObviously, even in ancient times, though the poem claims they \"never used\" gold and silver coins because they were \"too valuable,\" they didn't just sit on them forever... those coins simply were worth more than the going rate for brass coinage and so they either held the real gold coins or traded them far above the going coinage rate for the cheaper brass stuff.\n\nSo it is with BTC as well. Nobody is gonna pay using BTC when BTC is expected to keep gaining value and dollars are expected to decline. \n\nThis is a looooong ride, boys. It'll take a while to chase out all the bad money. \n\nKeep stacking.",

Only a relatively small number of btc will be taken out of the market by strike since they will be used for the settlement only which can be done million of times with the same btc.

A cheaper payment could have also be done by any other (centralized) systems like paypal is using for example.~~\n\nEdit: Delete #4.

If he's attacking something he does not understand, that shows him to be a fucked up piece of shit like Pena (\"bit fuck is going to ZERO!!\").  If he does understand Bitcoin, but attacks it anyhow, it shows he's a no-good lying piece of shit.  Certainly, he's *not* the wonderful genius the lying mainstream media wants you to believe.\n\nI've known people who have followed Buffett and his advice for many years.  They're not rich yet.  To be fair, they're not broke, either.  Some of the things Buffett says are actually good advice, but you'll hear the same thing from other, legitimate role models.  For example, \"be patient\".\n\nBitcoin is not a stock.  Bitcoin is a form of money.  If you're holding Bitcoin in order to merely increase your supply of fiat currency, you're not understanding what Bitcoin is.  \n\nAlt coins are scams.  Just stick with Bitcoin.

Since you are asking the questions you are asking, I think you in particular would find lots of answers to questions you are now having.\n\nOne point relevant to you thread I want to mention: Dalio talks about how we as individuals are very good at understanding change and evolution that has happened during our lifetime. However, there's lots of change and evolution that happens less frequently than once in a lifetime and we are very bad at understanding those. Effectively, they take us by surprise and we are unprepared.\n\nWe have all seen how tech companies evolve and fight for market share etc. But none of us have seen the shift of a reserve currency. To think that Bitcoin is like a tech company and cryptocurrencies the tech industry is enourmously misinformed. Bitcoin is like a currency.\n\nNow, the US dollar's status as a world reserve currency is on the decline. There is absolutely no doubt about that, virtually every metric is pointing that out. However, to replace a reserve currency, not only needs the old one to be in decline, but a new one needs to take it's place. The real question is: what will it be?\n\nDo you think the Chinese Renminbi is poised to take that position? How about the euro? Maybe gold?\n\nNone of the answers seem particularly convincing. Really makes you think...",

Surely someone who can understand the latter has 0 confusion over the former?\n\nIs your audience general, or do they have a background in cryptography already?\n\nIf the former, perhaps strike out #5, #7, #8, #9, #10 - that's just not needed.  And #6 isn't so much a misconception as it is a diverse topic, because you are already not focusing on Bitcoin alone based on your course title, I presume.  Once you count other cryptos, you will find that actually ASIC mining is the outlier, not the standard.\n\nAbout the BTC focus - I think #3 is wrong for some non-UTXO cryptos.  And the way you have written it, your clause \"**since** wallets do not store your coins\" makes it sound like the reason a transaction doesn't send/receive coins is precisely because of the wallet's structure.  Well that isn't true.  It is because of the UTXO nature of Bitcoin and other currencies that a transaction changes ownership of existing UTXOs rather than \"sending\" them somewhere.  The wallets for *all* cryptocurrencies don't store coins, because a wallet is as you point out elsewhere a keypair with some sugar, hook to the blockchain, and UI poured on top of it.  The tokens are on the blockchain just like my $ is in the bank's database despite me having my bank's app on my phone to see it and interact with it (god willing).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt almost seems like your list isn't really \"misconceptions\" but \"miscellany\".  Even the 21m BTC item is on your list as a trivia point relative to ETH rather than a myth clarification (the myth being, \"Anybody can just change the software and make more BTC\" or \"How do I *know* there's only going to be 21m?  Who decides?\")\n\nIf that's the case, consider separating it into categories of miscellany like \"Cryptography in Bitcoin\", \"Economic factors behind mining\", \"NFTs and who the fuck cares really ;)\", and \"Token growth schedules, burning, and the merits therein\".\n\nIf going for true myths, check out the Bitcoin wiki for examples to get the juices flowing.",

Your clustering of topics was confusing for me to read through, even as an educator in the space, but now I get that you were intending to kind of \"checklist\" all the statements you were making that you wanted community validation on.\n\nI would really recommend, given this spread of topics and the amount of time you have available to cover it, that you link each new concept with a real world example that the students can follow up with. For some of these, like forks, a more anthropological view (Bitcoin blocksize wars or ETH rollback after the DAO hack) would be appropriate; for others like multisig, a hands-on experiment setting up multisigs on Bitcoin testnet and having students try to \"behave maliciously\" would be great.\n\nFinally, if you haven't already thought of this, doing a test run on your modules with a single listener of approx the same technical level as your pupils, and scribbling down any questions they have which indicate gaps in your explanation, can be super helpful with such a complex interdisciplinary topic.\n\nThanks for clarifying, and happy teaching!",

                    "response": "https://armantheparman.com/why-bitcoin-only/\n\nI want to start by stressing that it all comes down to scarcity. Without scarcity, cryptocurrency may as well be fiat. Good money is scarce. The biggest weakness of cryptocurrencies is that they can be created easily from nothing. All alts are like this. But Bitcoin is different. It has miraculously been born and has gained a huge lead in network effects. This can not be copied. Thus, it has gained scarcity. It is extremely decentralised, and has by far the greatest hashing power on the planet, and distribution of full nodes, which makes it not possible to tamper with the monetary policy. Bitcoin has scarcity due to network effect lead and \u201cun-tamper-ability\u201d.\n\nThe Lindy effect will only make it stronger as day after day it doesn\u2019t die. It can\u2019t be eradicated, just like a cancer that has spread too far.\n\nThe copies cannot compete with this. It needs the majority to not only leave Bitcoin, but mostly leave to the same choice. There are thousands of choices, so those few people that abandon Bitcoin will not all go to the same choice. In other words, defectors will disperse, not concentrate. The only way this could theoretically happen is if there is some fatal flaw with Bitcoin, AND it can\u2019t be fixed, AND an altcoin can, AND only one altcoin can.\n\nE.g. let\u2019s say Bitcoin\u2019s privacy weakness (really it\u2019s a trade off, not a weakness and any other coin with privacy just chooses a different trade off) is suddenly critical and everyone is exiting. Where will they go? Monero, Zcash, DASH, some to ETH and XRP (not private btw), Cardano\u2026. Can they all be money? Money printer go brrrr much?\n\nSo how else can an Altcoin take over? Remember that people will save in the best money. An Altcoin must become fundamentally better. In the open source world, how is that possible? It\u2019s like thinking it\u2019s possible for a better operating system to exist than the dominant open source one today (GNU Linux). The open source leader just gets better and better. All new ideas get absorbed.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine another currency finds a good use case. Let\u2019s say smart contracts. First that\u2019s like saying paper is money and valuable because contracts can be written on it. No, you need to make good money first, not find other uses for it. Aluminium has more uses than gold but it\u2019s less valuable because it is not money. It can\u2019t be money because it is not scarce. But even if smart contracts makes a cryptocurrency into good money, there are too many: ETH, Cardano, TRON, Iota, probably others.\n\nAs soon as any becomes valuable, it will invite competition and it will be copied. There is no scarcity. For goodness sake, ETH doesn\u2019t even work yet. Its Turing completeness is not even used. Bitcoin has smart contract capability and I understand nearly everything ETH is doing program-wise can be done with Bitcoin. Let\u2019s face it, it is competing with Bitcoin as a money and is far far behind and has no credibility. What will Vitalik Buterin do with the monetary policy next?\n\nETH is just another fiat with a central banker. That is not a true cryptocurrency. Remember why Bitcoin was born \u2013 we are fighting central banking and trying to separate money and state, not shoot ourselves in the foot by losing focus, trying to get rich by improving on the solution we already miraculously discovered. Bitcoin is that: a miracle \u2013 and we should embrace it.\n\nAlso, you mention ROI. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist so you can buy it and sell it for more fiat later. It is a REPLACEMENT for fiat. You buy and NEVER sell. You spend once it achieves its true value. You don\u2019t need an exit strategy. You just save in Bitcoin. With alts, you need to time your exit and sell to a greater fool, because alts are scams, holding forever will get you rekt. Just DCA Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s like picking up gold off the ground before anyone else realises it will become money. Don\u2019t pick up pebbles or seashells (alts), your pockets have limited space. Finally, the most important problem to solve is separating money and state. All other problems are tiny in comparison. We don\u2019t need to replace the legal system with smart contracts. We don\u2019t need a token for everything. We don\u2019t need to put bananas on a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is an invention that solves a humanitarian problem. Altcoins take a solution (blockchain) and try to find a problem. Remember that.",

When you define it like that, you end up with many forensics investigators who seize a suspect's laptop and think that if they keep the laptop turned off, suspect's cryptocurrencies stay in the laptop because they are stored in their wallet. I met more than 10 people like this. So we should be clear that a wallet does not store Bitcoin, it is stored in the blockchain.\n\nRegarding 7: A multiplication for an algebraic group (or field) is defined on group (field) elements.

Think of christianity when it was a radical jewish sect of loudmouths willing to die for an idea. Or rap music coming out of the late 80s which was banned at my school and in my household. Consider vegans or even CrossFit when it was called a cult by the NYT. This is the *intransigent minority*, and bitcoin is no different, except bigger, because what it endeavors to do is separate money from State. It aims to be the honest base layer of the global financial system (which is so badly missing), which everything will build itself around, in layers, like everything properly built is, like planets, atoms, human bodies, and pizzas--layers. The time for bitcoin to die was back when it was weak and fragile, back when governments et al busied dismissing it as tulip mania (an episode which lasted only 6 months btw). 13 years in, the network has achieved staggering acknowledgement, and we're still so early. Bitcoin isn't going away, because the knowledge it's imbued so many with (finance, currencies, inflation, manipulation, etcetera) is permanent. It's like a reinterpretation of Fight Club's ending, except peaceful. A global *Project Mayhem*. As for you, I'd concern myself more with bitcoin the network than I would bitcoin the price--which is an emergent phenomena. The amount of trust (and thus value) it absorbs over time won't be anything short of staggering.",

One user who disliked those hexagon images made a browser plug-in to automatically block users with them. Another had a similar idea, tweeting, \u201cI\u2019m going to block every single NFT profile picture I see.\u201d\n\nAre these two anti-cryptocurrency people?\n\nNot exactly.\n\nThe first, the one who made the browser plug-in, an American software developer by the name of Andi McClure, is indeed anti-crypto. But the second isn\u2019t.\n\nThe second user is Francis Pouliot, who heads the Montreal-founded brokerage Bull Bitcoin. It\u2019s just that he doesn\u2019t like other cryptocurrencies or applications of bitcoin\u2019s blockchain technology, such as NFTs.\n\nThe wider world often uses terms such as \u201cbitcoin\u201d and \u201ccrypto\u201d interchangeably. But Mr. Pouliot finding common cause with Ms. McClure shows just how far apart different camps in crypto can be.\n\nInvestors should take note of that. It might be time to appreciate some of Mr. Pouliot\u2019s nuance and view bitcoin as distinct and separate from the rest of cryptocurrency.\n\nLast week, Mr. Pouliot spoke at Bitcoin 2022 in Miami, a major conference for the industry. To the outside world, it might be a \u201ccrypto\u201d event, but these guys hate that word. At the panel Mr. Pouliot was on, one speaker, when asked what the biggest threat to bitcoin is, replied \u201ccryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nLast year, at Bitcoin 2021, boxer Floyd Mayweather was booed when he showed up promoting a crypto project that was not bitcoin. The bitcoiner Jack Dorsey, who left Twitter before its NFT integration, tweeted this week he had \u201czero interest in cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nThere didn\u2019t used to be such a stark division. The project Mr. Mayweather was promoting was based on the blockchain network Ethereum, which more or less represents the non-bitcoin crypto world. That network was founded by Toronto\u2019s Vitalik Buterin, who also founded the industry publication Bitcoin Magazine, which organizes the Bitcoin conferences.\n\nBut Mr. Buterin\u2019s founding of the magazine had been back in 2011, only two years after bitcoin was introduced to the world, rising from a primordial pool of cypherpunk ideas and libertarian economic discourse. In those early days, \u201cbitcoin\u201d was indeed synonymous with \u201ccryptocurrency,\u201d for there wasn\u2019t much else aside from it.\n\nAnd bitcoin does only one thing. It enables direct transfers of value without a central organization overseeing it, and because of that it is resistant to control by any one party.\n\nSoon, though, the tent grew. More people took notice, and they sought to use bitcoin\u2019s blockchain technology for other purposes. This precipitated the birth of Mr. Buterin\u2019s Ethereum network, introduced to the world in 2014.\n\nThat, in turn, was the beginning of the crypto world we know today, in which anyone, including central banks, can create their own coin, NFT or blockchain application. Amid all those developments, Mr. Buterin sold Bitcoin Magazine, which turned bitcoin-only in 2018 \u2013 in a way symbolizing the split between the one-track bitcoin and the rest of crypto mushrooming in all directions.\n\nThe more stringent of the bitcoin-only folks are often called \u201cbitcoin maximalists.\u201d They want only the one thing bitcoin does. They see the pictures of apes selling for hundreds of thousands, those coins based on dogs, and the rampant thievery and fraud \u2013 and they share the disdain of mainstream crypto critics. It\u2019s just like how it is with Mr. Pouliot and Ms. McClure and NFTs.\n\nThe maximalists are not wrong, in a way. Thirteen years is a long time for crypto. With every boom-bust cycle, hot new use cases for blockchain and bald-faced scams have come and gone. So have thousands of shiny new coins. Bitcoin is still standing.\n\nBut the point isn\u2019t so much whether the maximalists are right or wrong. It\u2019s also how Mr. Buterin\u2019s Ethereum, with its ether coin, is one of the few non-bitcoin crypto projects to have lasted as long as it did. Its longevity comes not from trying to do what bitcoin does \u2013 which it can\u2019t \u2013 but by going around that and doing what bitcoin does not do, such as being the platform for NFTs and higher-ambition blockchain computing. Bitcoin and the rest of crypto serve different purposes.\n\nOne caveat is that the prices of most cryptocurrencies still have some correlation with bitcoin. But so do all related companies or commodities: gold and silver, Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp., oil and gas.\n\nYet they are so different that, in 2009, Ovintiv Inc., then known as Encana and based in Calgary, spun off Cenovus Inc. to make one gas company and one oil company, so that investors could focus on one or the other.\n\nIt helps to look at bitcoin and the rest of crypto through that lens.",

                                    "response": "Ethereum is a centralized scam that totally revolutionized scams and is the future of pyramid schemes (how many ERC20 pyramid scamcoins run on top of Ethereum again?) But it would still be a centralized scam even if it was created without the massive premine. \n\nEthereum started with a 72 million ETH premine, but that doesn't mean people can't make money with it. A lot of people even made money with bitconnect, dogecoin, and shiba inu... So as long as suckers keep buying ETH then its price can keep going up. But institutional investors have no interest in ETH and [this report titled \"An Investor's Take on Cryptoassets\" details why](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor's+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf). That report even explains that when the fees get too high and things don't go as planned, users will (and are) switch to a different cryptocurrency. You can already see this happening right now with all of the \"eth killers.\" That report also explains what makes BTC attractive to them.\n\n[Click here and listen to a few minutes of Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song talk about Ethereum and Vitalik.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&t=47m24s) \n\nJimmy worked directly with Vitalik from the beginning, back when Vitalik was still working on rootstock for Bitcoin.\n\nOver 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as Bitcoin. Satoshi created Bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without the trust or permission of anyone else. Bitcoin had no premine, no developer fund, no developer tax, and no leader. Satoshi never sold, made no profit, got no fame for his real identity, removed himself from the project, and he gave a two month heads up about before he launched Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized and trustless with the full nodes in control of the protocol, and it has no leader or company leading it.\n \nCryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. People use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their Bitcoin stack or even their Ethereum stack if they don't understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Gambling on altcoins can still be very profitable during a bull run, but making a profit is not guaranteed and you can easily lose BTC when gambling on altcoins. \n\nSatoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that Bitcoin was launched fairly:\n\n* No premine (Satoshi didn\u2019t grant himself any coins)\n\n* Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network (no sudden release and no mining before release)\n\n* Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely (it's not even possible for an altcoin to replicate this)\n\n* Satoshi never cashed out (unlike every altcoin founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)\n\nEthereum launched with 12 million ETH for the developers, and 60 million ETH for sale as an \"initial coin offering\" during the presale. They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine and ignoring the 60 million that they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after Ethereum developers and the Ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security, because that's what it is according to the [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp).\n\n[Here is a clip of Joseph Lubin describing how they allowed whales to use multiple fake identities to buy as much ETH as they wanted during the Ethereum presale.](https://i.imgur.com/HpBR7C5.mp4) \"A person can buy with any number of different identities. We may limit the unit size of a single sale to make it easier to disguise. So that nobody scares people with an enormous initial purchase. If you are a whale and you plan on investing several million US dollars worth, then you can do so with with multiple identities.\"\n\nVitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot and he knew better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to investors. Another example is pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETH, now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but \"rich statefulness.\" \n\n[Gregory Maxwell: \u201cVitalik Buterin Ran A Quantum Computer Scam\u201d](http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/08/17/gregory-maxwell-vitalik-buterin-ran-quantum-computer-scam/)\n\n[Quantum Computing and Bitcoin with Vitalik Buterin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkUpZkeqhF4)\n\n[Vitalik\u2019s Quantum Scam](https://medium.com/bitcoinerrorlog/vitaliks-quantum-quest-9e6af6570f23)\n\nThe Ethereum community has endorsed radical changes and pivots, trying to find narrative fit and the Ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit. They've literally tried world computer, dapps, crowdfunding, NFTs, DeFi, open finance, radical markets, store of value, and more. Ethereum is an aggregator of these narratives, trying each one out over the years in an attempt to seduce people that are uneducated about cryptocurrency. But there is no persistence of a singular narrative when it comes to Ethereum and they are still trying to find product market fit even after all this time.\n\nEthereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. What purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems? They also advertised immutability and unstoppable contracts that were then immediately reversed with multiple hard forks. \n\nUnlike Ethereum, Bitcoin's inflation rate and maximum supply are clearly defined and they will never change. Ethereum's inflation rate, maximum supply, and final algo are not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and it basically amounts to faith in Vitalik and his team. While at the same time newbies are misled into believing that Ethereum is decentralized. Meanwhile, Vitalik has full control over the whole project. Does anybody else here remember the DAO smart contract? Someone found a way to drain ETH and some of Vitalik's buddies lost a ton of ETH, so he rolled back the entire blockchain because Ethereum is centralized, Vitalik is the leader of it, and everyone in the Ethereum community agrees with him, so he can do whatever he wants with Ethereum. He chose to change the name of the real Ethereum blockchain to Ethereum Classic and calls his rolled back blockchain Ethereum. Not long ago ETH miners said they weren't going to follow Vitalik into adding a ponzi style transaction fee burn, so Vitalik, leader of Ethereum, called their consensus a 51% attack and changed the rules. \n\nThe fact that Ethereum has switched over to staking rewards also has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your ETH being staked will expose users to legal tax obligations. Exchanges for example must send a 1099-MISC to the IRS on behalf of any American user earning $600 in a year. Proof-of-Stake also makes it so the already rich whales control the network and will be collecting compounding interest to dump on the open market.\n\nEthereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch and I have no expectation that the new Ethereum will be any more successful than the current one. This can only be done because Ethereum is centralized. Ethereum 2 will still be a centralized scamcoin controlled and ran by scammers.  \n\n[Vitalik is already laying the groundwork for some more hype and suggesting a re-brand to Ethereum 3.0!](https://i.imgur.com/mxIzBYK.mp4)\n\nEthereum scam part 1 - [Here we focus on the Ethereum token pre-sale which to anyone with any financial experience, is an obvious sale of an unlicensed unregistered security.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUVlatCvp0)\n\nEthereum scam part 2 - [Here we take a look at the value & business proposition of Decentralized Smart Contracts and why it's one of the dumbest ways to make your business more efficient.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCiHTJRbIf4)\n\nEthereum scam part 3 - [The Ethereum scam part 3.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgFXqVpGDNg)\n\nhttps://medium.com/startup-grind/i-was-wrong-about-ethereum-804c9a906d36\n\n[Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are Scams and so are the developers that build on them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtVLjCxPDU)\n\n\"The Ethereum blockchain growing 85 terabytes per year is totally fine. If you have even one person that just keeps buying like a hundred dollar hard drive like I think once every month then they can store it.\" \u2013 Vitalik Buterin\n\nSource: https://i.imgur.com/1FZdLC5.mp4",

It was seriously just explaining how he built hype and then sold you on buying a few pamphlets that explained how he got you to buy a few pamphlets. Make something people think they want and sell it to them. I appreciate how honest it was just laid it all out.\n\nEdit iirc the content literally started with \"How did I make a million in 24hrs?

The official data is kept purposefully low, as acknowledging true inflation (well over 10% right now in terms of real loss of purchasing power) would lead to issues with entitlement/SS COLAs that would send us even deeper into debt.\n\nWhen we had the inflation before (1970s) there were 2 key differences between then & now: (1) We were not $30 Trillion in debt back then.  Now we are so far in debt, we won't be able to service the debt once interest rates rise, and interest rates are bound to rise with the higher inflation we are now facing, and (2) Back in the 70's when we had nominal inflation around 12%, you could earn 7% interest on cash you held in bank savings/MM accounts, so really you were only losing about 5% of purchasing power annually to inflation.  Today we have true inflation > 10% (officially 8.5%) but you earn 0.002% interest on your cash accounts.  So the situation today is actually worse for your average household.",

I had ideas about creating my own coin, to solve the 'proof of work is inefficient' \"problem\" with bitcoin.\n\nI have P and NP tattooed on m wrists. These are famous computational complexity classes, the subject of an open question in theoretical computer science (does P = NP?) and, i think, one of the most interesting questions people have ever asked.   I was obsessed with this question for a long time, hence the tattoos.\n\nI had really been excited about the possibility of building a coin that might 'solve' the problem using a clever workaround: build a database of solutions to NP complete problems.   It seemed so poetic, i was in love with the idea. I _had_ to do it. But of course i didn't want to rip off a bunch of people who were investing in what might not work. So i had to first confirm to my satisfaction that i could actually deliver this thing.\n\nSo i started looking into bitcoin even more, to better understand exactly how it works. How does block difficulty adjustment work? How are the nodes agreeing on how much to adjust the difficulty? What exactly prevents different attacks on the longest chain from succeeding?  _why_ does proof of work actually work?\n\nAnd eventually it became clear that even though i previously _thought_ i understood bitcoin, i really hadn't.  I hadn't gotten just how tightly it all fits together, and how removing any one piece of the design - like the requirement that you can't start work on block n+1 until you have full knowledge of block n - makes the whole thing fall apart.\n\nAt that point i went full maxi.",

But it would still be a centralized scam even if it was created without the massive 72 million ETH premine. \n\nEthereum started with a 72 million ETH premine, but that doesn't mean people can't make money with it. A lot of people even made money with bitconnect, dogecoin, and shiba inu... So as long as suckers keep buying ETH then its price can keep going up. But institutional investors have no interest in ETH and [this report titled \"An Investor's Take on Cryptoassets\" details why](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor's+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf). That report even explains that when the fees get too high and things don't go as planned, users will (and are) switch to a different cryptocurrency. You can already see this happening right now with all of the \"ETH killers.\" That report also explains what makes BTC attractive to them.\n\n[Click here and listen to a few minutes of Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song talk about Ethereum and Vitalik.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&t=47m24s) \n\nJimmy worked directly with Vitalik from the beginning, back when Vitalik was still working on rootstock for Bitcoin.\n\nOver 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as Bitcoin. Satoshi created Bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without the trust or permission of anyone else. Bitcoin had no premine, no developer fund, no developer tax, and no leader. Satoshi never sold, made no profit, got no fame for his real identity, removed himself from the project, and he gave a two month heads up about before he launched Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized and trustless with the full nodes in control of the protocol, and it has no leader or company leading it.\n \nCryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. People use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their Bitcoin stack or even their Ethereum stack if they don't understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Gambling on altcoins can still be very profitable during a bull run, but making a profit is not guaranteed and you can easily lose BTC when gambling on altcoins. \n\nSatoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that Bitcoin was launched fairly:\n\n* No premine (Satoshi didn\u2019t grant himself any coins)\n\n* Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network (no sudden release and no mining before release)\n\n* Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely (it's not even possible for an altcoin to replicate this)\n\n* Satoshi never cashed out (unlike every altcoin founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)\n\nEthereum launched with 12 million ETH for the developers, and 60 million ETH for sale as an \"initial coin offering\" during the presale. They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine and ignoring the 60 million that they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after Ethereum developers and the Ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security, because that's what it is according to the [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp).\n\n[Here is a clip of Joseph Lubin describing how they allowed whales to use multiple fake identities to buy as much ETH as they wanted during the Ethereum presale.](https://i.imgur.com/HpBR7C5.mp4) \"A person can buy with any number of different identities. We may limit the unit size of a single sale to make it easier to disguise. So that nobody scares people with an enormous initial purchase. If you are a whale and you plan on investing several million US dollars worth, then you can do so with with multiple identities.\"\n\nVitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot and he knew better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to investors. Another example is pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETH, now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but \"rich statefulness.\" \n\n[Gregory Maxwell: \u201cVitalik Buterin Ran A Quantum Computer Scam\u201d](http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/08/17/gregory-maxwell-vitalik-buterin-ran-quantum-computer-scam/)\n\n[Quantum Computing and Bitcoin with Vitalik Buterin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkUpZkeqhF4)\n\n[Vitalik\u2019s Quantum Scam](https://medium.com/bitcoinerrorlog/vitaliks-quantum-quest-9e6af6570f23)\n\nThe Ethereum community has endorsed radical changes and pivots, trying to find narrative fit and the Ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit. They've literally tried world computer, dapps, crowdfunding, NFTs, DeFi, open finance, radical markets, store of value, and more. Ethereum is an aggregator of these narratives, trying each one out over the years in an attempt to seduce people that are uneducated about cryptocurrency. But there is no persistence of a singular narrative when it comes to Ethereum and they are still trying to find product market fit even after all this time.\n\nEthereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. What purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems? They also advertised immutability and unstoppable contracts that were then immediately reversed with multiple hard forks. \n\nUnlike Ethereum, Bitcoin's inflation rate and maximum supply are clearly defined and they will never change. Ethereum's inflation rate, maximum supply, and final algo are not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and it basically amounts to faith in Vitalik and his team. While at the same time newbies are misled into believing that Ethereum is decentralized. Meanwhile, Vitalik has full control over the whole project. Does anybody else here remember the DAO smart contract? Someone found a way to drain ETH and some of Vitalik's buddies lost a ton of ETH, so he rolled back the entire blockchain because Ethereum is centralized, Vitalik is the leader of it, and everyone in the Ethereum community agrees with him, so he can do whatever he wants with Ethereum. He chose to change the name of the real Ethereum blockchain to Ethereum Classic and calls his rolled back blockchain Ethereum. Not long ago ETH miners said they weren't going to follow Vitalik into adding a ponzi style transaction fee burn, so Vitalik, leader of Ethereum, called their consensus a 51% attack and changed the rules. \n\nThe fact that Ethereum has switched over to staking rewards also has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your ETH being staked will expose users to legal tax obligations. Exchanges for example must send a 1099-MISC to the IRS on behalf of any American user earning $600 in a year. Proof-of-Stake also makes it so the already rich whales control the network and will be collecting compounding interest to dump on the open market.\n\nEthereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch and I have no expectation that the new Ethereum will be any more successful than the current one. This can only be done because Ethereum is centralized. Ethereum 2 will still be a centralized scamcoin controlled and ran by scammers.  \n\n[Vitalik is already laying the groundwork for some more hype and suggesting a re-brand to Ethereum 3.0!](https://i.imgur.com/mxIzBYK.mp4)\n\nEthereum scam part 1 - [Here we focus on the Ethereum token pre-sale which to anyone with any financial experience, is an obvious sale of an unlicensed unregistered security.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUVlatCvp0)\n\nEthereum scam part 2 - [Here we take a look at the value & business proposition of Decentralized Smart Contracts and why it's one of the dumbest ways to make your business more efficient.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCiHTJRbIf4)\n\nEthereum scam part 3 - [The Ethereum scam part 3.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgFXqVpGDNg)\n\nhttps://medium.com/startup-grind/i-was-wrong-about-ethereum-804c9a906d36\n\n[Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are Scams and so are the developers that build on them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtVLjCxPDU)\n\n\"The Ethereum blockchain growing 85 terabytes per year is totally fine. If you have even one person that just keeps buying like a hundred dollar hard drive like I think once every month then they can store it.\" \u2013 Vitalik Buterin\n\nSource: https://i.imgur.com/1FZdLC5.mp4",

There would be better investments, good businesses and cash flowing or high demand properties, but for safety Bitcoin is a good get.\n\nNow do you want to buy a piece of that? Does that sound like something you would like to own?\n\nBitcoin excites me because if that prospect, yes of course people who are early adopters will be rewarded for taking on the early risk (as will you if you buy at 40k) but the coolest thing is that even people of that era will get tremendous benefit from Bitcoin!\n\nYou are not too late to asymmetrically benefit from Bitcoin in a big way.\n\nNo one will be too late for Bitcoin.",

On top of that you have a $250 trillion real estate market that will be tokenized and a $200 trillion stock market that will experience the same which won't all go into bitcoin but bitcoin will be the main currency its sold and traded for with fiat experiencing high inflation for the coming decade.\n\nThe 18 years is based on a 30 year technology bull cycle that every major tech advancement has experienced from the railroad to radio, tv, internet  smartphones which all have reached their peak within 30 years untill the next major advancement comes along. 12 years have already passed so 18 more years.",

I want it to be like the Super Bowl. That means we\u2019re getting to the moon, to mainstream adoption. Welcome to capitalism!",

This project has plenty of supporters of all kinds, the skeptical people vary as well. Many people aren't even traders nor have any desire to invest so assuming they missed out on something they would've never done in any context is also just a fallacious argument.\n\nPeople are being forced to see and get past all this stuff they don't want at all in previously unrelated things like VR and it's being shoved in their faces as a \"certain future\" with many irrational arguments, so they have every right to be pissed off.\n\nThere must be places to criticize financially incentivized positions and it should be welcomed and nothing is perfect. Yes, it will often be inaccurate just like shilling is often inaccurate, but it's necessary.\n\nMost people aren't under a dictator's regime and do not see or experience censorship pretty much ever, they just want to feed kids and go to work to be able to do that. They recycle trying to do the tiniest thing for the environment. So it's completely reasonable when they question something they do not personally need, want, believe in, nor agree with what it costs.\n\nYou say it's about NFTs or random tokens? May I remind you those were invented on Bitcoin? Maybe it wasn't promoted via hiring Paris Hilton telling people it's collectable art, yet there's plenty of awkward history.",

It is clearly part of the Darwinian elimination process. That is why the banks should confiscate harder and more often. In a Darwinian biology system, not everybody is supposed to survive.

Maybe this isn't a huge deal when shopping online from home, and it isn't a problem for crowdfunding truckers, buying a large ticket item, or paying your friend for a meal, most of which all bitcoiners have done for years. But for unit-of-account activities, and POS transactions, it's non-sensical. And when we're in a Taproot world (full integrations coming soon), the LN will actually be more private than L1 is. With Taproot address scripting and signatures, they're interoperable with the LN via PLTC's. Basically wallets will make everything frictionless, and everyone will have L1 and the LN at their whim.

I had ideas about creating my own coin, to solve the 'proof of work is inefficient' \"problem\" with bitcoin.\n\nI have P and NP tattooed on m wrists. These are famous computational complexity classes, the subject of an open question in theoretical computer science (does P = NP?) and, i think, one of the most interesting questions people have ever asked.   I was obsessed with this question for a long time, hence the tattoos.\n\nI had really been excited about the possibility of building a coin that might 'solve' the problem using a clever workaround: build a database of solutions to NP complete problems.   It seemed so poetic, i was in love with the idea. I _had_ to do it. But of course i didn't want to rip off a bunch of people who were investing in what might not work. So i had to first confirm to my satisfaction that i could actually deliver this thing.\n\nSo i started looking into bitcoin even more, to better understand exactly how it works. How does block difficulty adjustment work? How are the nodes agreeing on how much to adjust the difficulty? What exactly prevents different attacks on the longest chain from succeeding?  _why_ does proof of work actually work?\n\nAnd eventually it became clear that even though i previously _thought_ i understood bitcoin, i really hadn't.  I hadn't gotten just how tightly it all fits together, and how removing any one piece of the design - like the requirement that you can't start work on block n+1 until you have full knowledge of block n - makes the whole thing fall apart.\n\nAt that point i went full maxi.",

But it would still be a centralized scam even if it was created without the massive 72 million ETH premine. \n\nEthereum started with a 72 million ETH premine, but that doesn't mean people can't make money with it. A lot of people even made money with bitconnect, dogecoin, and shiba inu... So as long as suckers keep buying ETH then its price can keep going up. But institutional investors have no interest in ETH and [this report titled \"An Investor's Take on Cryptoassets\" details why](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor's+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf). That report even explains that when the fees get too high and things don't go as planned, users will (and are) switch to a different cryptocurrency. You can already see this happening right now with all of the \"ETH killers.\" That report also explains what makes BTC attractive to them.\n\n[Click here and listen to a few minutes of Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song talk about Ethereum and Vitalik.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&t=47m24s) \n\nJimmy worked directly with Vitalik from the beginning, back when Vitalik was still working on rootstock for Bitcoin.\n\nOver 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as Bitcoin. Satoshi created Bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without the trust or permission of anyone else. Bitcoin had no premine, no developer fund, no developer tax, and no leader. Satoshi never sold, made no profit, got no fame for his real identity, removed himself from the project, and he gave a two month heads up about before he launched Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized and trustless with the full nodes in control of the protocol, and it has no leader or company leading it.\n \nCryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. People use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their Bitcoin stack or even their Ethereum stack if they don't understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Gambling on altcoins can still be very profitable during a bull run, but making a profit is not guaranteed and you can easily lose BTC when gambling on altcoins. \n\nSatoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that Bitcoin was launched fairly:\n\n* No premine (Satoshi didn\u2019t grant himself any coins)\n\n* Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network (no sudden release and no mining before release)\n\n* Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely (it's not even possible for an altcoin to replicate this)\n\n* Satoshi never cashed out (unlike every altcoin founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)\n\nEthereum launched with 12 million ETH for the developers, and 60 million ETH for sale as an \"initial coin offering\" during the presale. They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine and ignoring the 60 million that they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after Ethereum developers and the Ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security, because that's what it is according to the [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp).\n\n[Here is a clip of Joseph Lubin describing how they allowed whales to use multiple fake identities to buy as much ETH as they wanted during the Ethereum presale.](https://i.imgur.com/HpBR7C5.mp4) \"A person can buy with any number of different identities. We may limit the unit size of a single sale to make it easier to disguise. So that nobody scares people with an enormous initial purchase. If you are a whale and you plan on investing several million US dollars worth, then you can do so with with multiple identities.\"\n\nVitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot and he knew better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to investors. Another example is pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETH, now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but \"rich statefulness.\" \n\n[Gregory Maxwell: \u201cVitalik Buterin Ran A Quantum Computer Scam\u201d](http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/08/17/gregory-maxwell-vitalik-buterin-ran-quantum-computer-scam/)\n\n[Quantum Computing and Bitcoin with Vitalik Buterin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkUpZkeqhF4)\n\n[Vitalik\u2019s Quantum Scam](https://medium.com/bitcoinerrorlog/vitaliks-quantum-quest-9e6af6570f23)\n\nThe Ethereum community has endorsed radical changes and pivots, trying to find narrative fit and the Ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit. They've literally tried world computer, dapps, crowdfunding, NFTs, DeFi, open finance, radical markets, store of value, and more. Ethereum is an aggregator of these narratives, trying each one out over the years in an attempt to seduce people that are uneducated about cryptocurrency. But there is no persistence of a singular narrative when it comes to Ethereum and they are still trying to find product market fit even after all this time.\n\nEthereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. What purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems? They also advertised immutability and unstoppable contracts that were then immediately reversed with multiple hard forks. \n\nUnlike Ethereum, Bitcoin's inflation rate and maximum supply are clearly defined and they will never change. Ethereum's inflation rate, maximum supply, and final algo are not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and it basically amounts to faith in Vitalik and his team. While at the same time newbies are misled into believing that Ethereum is decentralized. Meanwhile, Vitalik has full control over the whole project. Does anybody else here remember the DAO smart contract? Someone found a way to drain ETH and some of Vitalik's buddies lost a ton of ETH, so he rolled back the entire blockchain because Ethereum is centralized, Vitalik is the leader of it, and everyone in the Ethereum community agrees with him, so he can do whatever he wants with Ethereum. He chose to change the name of the real Ethereum blockchain to Ethereum Classic and calls his rolled back blockchain Ethereum. Not long ago ETH miners said they weren't going to follow Vitalik into adding a ponzi style transaction fee burn, so Vitalik, leader of Ethereum, called their consensus a 51% attack and changed the rules. \n\nThe fact that Ethereum has switched over to staking rewards also has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your ETH being staked will expose users to legal tax obligations. Exchanges for example must send a 1099-MISC to the IRS on behalf of any American user earning $600 in a year. Proof-of-Stake also makes it so the already rich whales control the network and will be collecting compounding interest to dump on the open market.\n\nEthereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch and I have no expectation that the new Ethereum will be any more successful than the current one. This can only be done because Ethereum is centralized. Ethereum 2 will still be a centralized scamcoin controlled and ran by scammers.  \n\n[Vitalik is already laying the groundwork for some more hype and suggesting a re-brand to Ethereum 3.0!](https://i.imgur.com/mxIzBYK.mp4)\n\nEthereum scam part 1 - [Here we focus on the Ethereum token pre-sale which to anyone with any financial experience, is an obvious sale of an unlicensed unregistered security.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUVlatCvp0)\n\nEthereum scam part 2 - [Here we take a look at the value & business proposition of Decentralized Smart Contracts and why it's one of the dumbest ways to make your business more efficient.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCiHTJRbIf4)\n\nEthereum scam part 3 - [The Ethereum scam part 3.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgFXqVpGDNg)\n\nhttps://medium.com/startup-grind/i-was-wrong-about-ethereum-804c9a906d36\n\n[Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are Scams and so are the developers that build on them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtVLjCxPDU)\n\n\"The Ethereum blockchain growing 85 terabytes per year is totally fine. If you have even one person that just keeps buying like a hundred dollar hard drive like I think once every month then they can store it.\" \u2013 Vitalik Buterin\n\nSource: https://i.imgur.com/1FZdLC5.mp4",

I agree that nodes are still anemic, which is telling of how much growth there is, but consider the LN is growing parabolically in terms of nodes and BTC in channels, even with a 50% BTC price drawdown over the last 6 months. TX's are exploding as well. Very encouraging. The real problem is that Taproot hasn't percolated yet. When that happens, everything changes. Much easier, faster, and private. \n\nThis wasn't a conference Jordan Peterson should've been at. He doesn't know the space or nuance enough to apply his macro, at least not yet.

I had mentioned in another post that there were a few names on their \"front and center\" list that didn't belong anywhere near a Bitcoin conference but didn't want to name them out of fear the conversation would turn political.  Seems I was right to be skeptical.  Do you think their presence was overall helpful, in the sense that it drew attention and brought new audiences to Bitcoin?  Or did the negative outweigh the positive?",

Also it kinda shows how we're still a little bit underground and on the edge. It's neutral money, it's just that the left (I'm left-leaning) hasn't fully woken up to it, but they will when they sense the green energy explosion miner's will require to stay ahead of the difficulty adjustment. More on that in a different post.\n\nLummis is important as well. All she needs to do is get a bill through, even if she compromises with what's currently written in her bill, because bitcoiner's will rapidly figure out all the ways around the bill's bad shit, implement the changes, then basically bitcoin companies (most are run by hardcore bitcoiners) will have free-reign to go out into the world and plug it into anything that resembles an outlet. Open source money isn't something government's will be able to get a handle on once they make the foolish decision of drafting any bill that effectively legalizes it.

So it's a shame for them to send people to Changelly and experience such awful things. I've asked Ledger in one of their Youtube video if they are aware that Changelly is problematic and screwing their customer and we should share the word that they are shady af and to not use their horrendous services.

Basically they are unsure what legal liability they are opening up to themselves by releasing your funds to you. It is insane that they don't make this clear before your transaction. But that would explain the insane long \"review\" time. I don't know if legal counsel could \"speed\" things up? But it would be pricy and possibly not resolve the situation quicker? I understand the situation sucks but from the way they have responded you it seems they are not intent on being helpful to you as a customer, but rather to themselves. \n\nMy reasoning for suspecting the above is because my friend applied for a service in his bank that has a review time of 10 weeks. Because he mentioned crypto in his application, the application was treated as having a potential high risk of money laundering liability, and has taken over 8 months to review because of long back logs.\n\nI don't know if any of this is useful information to you. But I really hope your issue is solved asap.",

OBTC has low liquidity but only 0.5% annual fees. Just make sure to buy with a limit order.\n\nI know there are also \"Bitcoin IRAs\" that buy Bitcoin on your behalf, but the premiums and fees made this inferior to the two options above the last time I checked.\n\nIf you are a hardcore \"Not your coins not your crypto\" person, there is only one option of course: self-directed IRA.",

That's a guaranteed 20% or more loss. Over the past 10 years Bitcoin has increased *significantly*, and will probably make up for that 20% loss pretty quickly, but there's a chance it could take a long time or maybe we don't see the same gains that we've seen in the past.\n\nPersonally for me I would figure out what % of my net worth I want to have in Bitcoin, go with option 2, and DCA as aggressively as I can into Bitcoin (without missing out on any 401k matching the new employer offers) until I reach that %.

So honestly you\u2019ll know the answer before you even ask it lol. This is a personal choice. Do you think it\u2019s a good idea? Do it. If it is, you\u2019ll reap the rewards. If it\u2019s not, you\u2019ll deal with the consequences. Nobody in this sub is going to have to deal with a loss (if you unfortunately have that happen). The guys who hype you up and tell you it\u2019s the greatest idea ever aren\u2019t going to feel a thing if Bitcoin made you declare bankruptcy. (Not that it will of course, I\u2019m just talking in hypotheticals to get the point across). In my personal opinion, no. You should not take money out of retirement to buy Bitcoin. Yes you pay taxes and fees but you\u2019re also pulling from what should be your MAIN retirement fund. In MY opinion, Bitcoin is a side investment. Not a \u201cI\u2019ll put every dollar I have in Bitcoin wooooo yolo\u201d. Again, that\u2019s just me. When investing Bitcoin only invest what you can afford to lose. If you REALLY want to buy Bitcoin that badly, why don\u2019t you pick up some overtime at work and use that to buy it? Sure it may take a while but if you want to be a whole coiner it\u2019ll work and the only thing you potentially lose is your time. All the rest of your money is diversified in other investments like your 401k. Also, being a \u201cwhole coiner\u201d is a nice milestone but it\u2019s not like that\u2019s the magical number that you\u2019ll now strike it rich. Best of luck bro. Again, all this is MY opinion.

Bitcoin won't become a medium of exchange and stabilize until merchants start demanding to be paid in it because otherwise clients will just prefer to hodl and pay in depreciating fiat as they currently do (Gresham's law).",

Computers become exponentially more powerful allowing for new kinds of software that weren't possible even a decade earlier. We're building things our grandparents couldn't have dreamed of building. This is all true.\n\nAnd yet... Bitcoin is forever. Trustless decentralized digital assets peaked in 2008. Cryptocurrency is immune to the Exponential Age, I guess? We won't use all of that magical science fiction hardware that's coming down the pipe to build a new thing we \"never could have dreamed of\" in the cryptocurrency space?\n\nI'm pro-Bitcoin (and my money is very much where my mouth is). But I'm also fully aware that Bitcoin is just the \"lightbulb\" in comparison to future innovations that we don't even see coming. In the next two decades there's no reason to think we couldn't see new innovations that absolutely disrupt and redefine the crypto space and leave Bitcoin in the dust. If you think this isn't a concern then you don't actually believe in your Exponential Age and its implications.\n\nThis is why I laugh whenever I see threads about what happens after the last Bitcoin gets mined. The idea that Bitcoin will be important over a century from now is delusional. Predictions about Bitcoin's importance twenty years from now can't hope to be accurate. Predictions about its importance ten years from now might be close to accurate, but that's pushing it. I say all this because I actually believe that we are in the Exponential Age. Bitcoin isn't exempt from being steamrolled out of nowhere by runaway progress.\n\nPosts like this one are part of why Bitcoin isn't taken as seriously as it should be (though this post is still better than most of what gets upvoted in the crypto subs). Bitcoin needs sober analysis that takes all the risks and unknowns very seriously, not breathless cheerleading full of bolded text like those pamphlets you used to get in the mail from crackpots trying to rally people to some cause or other. The latter will convince the teenagers who are DCA-ing their way to a whole 1/10th of a coin, but it doesn't convince the grown-ups of the world who can put real skin in the game and propel adoption to the next level. They can smell the willful blindness to risks and unknowns all over this thread and it reinforces their impression that crypto is for kids.",

Insofar as s2f has good explanatory powers it is a reliable model.  However it factors supply not demand, which will change with adoption (people using) and the proportion of wealth they hold (penetration).  As a result it will prove in the fullness of time to be an underestimate (given hyperbitcoinization) and (IMHO) in the short/medium term exhibit periodic tendencies to over-estimate - these tendencies will diminish as value stabilises and therefore speculation opportunities fall",

Surely someone who can understand the latter has 0 confusion over the former?\n\nIs your audience general, or do they have a background in cryptography already?\n\nIf the former, perhaps strike out #5, #7, #8, #9, #10 - that's just not needed.  And #6 isn't so much a misconception as it is a diverse topic, because you are already not focusing on Bitcoin alone based on your course title, I presume.  Once you count other cryptos, you will find that actually ASIC mining is the outlier, not the standard.\n\nAbout the BTC focus - I think #3 is wrong for some non-UTXO cryptos.  And the way you have written it, your clause \"**since** wallets do not store your coins\" makes it sound like the reason a transaction doesn't send/receive coins is precisely because of the wallet's structure.  Well that isn't true.  It is because of the UTXO nature of Bitcoin and other currencies that a transaction changes ownership of existing UTXOs rather than \"sending\" them somewhere.  The wallets for *all* cryptocurrencies don't store coins, because a wallet is as you point out elsewhere a keypair with some sugar, hook to the blockchain, and UI poured on top of it.  The tokens are on the blockchain just like my $ is in the bank's database despite me having my bank's app on my phone to see it and interact with it (god willing).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt almost seems like your list isn't really \"misconceptions\" but \"miscellany\".  Even the 21m BTC item is on your list as a trivia point relative to ETH rather than a myth clarification (the myth being, \"Anybody can just change the software and make more BTC\" or \"How do I *know* there's only going to be 21m?  Who decides?\")\n\nIf that's the case, consider separating it into categories of miscellany like \"Cryptography in Bitcoin\", \"Economic factors behind mining\", \"NFTs and who the fuck cares really ;)\", and \"Token growth schedules, burning, and the merits therein\".\n\nIf going for true myths, check out the Bitcoin wiki for examples to get the juices flowing.",

Your clustering of topics was confusing for me to read through, even as an educator in the space, but now I get that you were intending to kind of \"checklist\" all the statements you were making that you wanted community validation on.\n\nI would really recommend, given this spread of topics and the amount of time you have available to cover it, that you link each new concept with a real world example that the students can follow up with. For some of these, like forks, a more anthropological view (Bitcoin blocksize wars or ETH rollback after the DAO hack) would be appropriate; for others like multisig, a hands-on experiment setting up multisigs on Bitcoin testnet and having students try to \"behave maliciously\" would be great.\n\nFinally, if you haven't already thought of this, doing a test run on your modules with a single listener of approx the same technical level as your pupils, and scribbling down any questions they have which indicate gaps in your explanation, can be super helpful with such a complex interdisciplinary topic.\n\nThanks for clarifying, and happy teaching!",

                    "response": "https://armantheparman.com/why-bitcoin-only/\n\nI want to start by stressing that it all comes down to scarcity. Without scarcity, cryptocurrency may as well be fiat. Good money is scarce. The biggest weakness of cryptocurrencies is that they can be created easily from nothing. All alts are like this. But Bitcoin is different. It has miraculously been born and has gained a huge lead in network effects. This can not be copied. Thus, it has gained scarcity. It is extremely decentralised, and has by far the greatest hashing power on the planet, and distribution of full nodes, which makes it not possible to tamper with the monetary policy. Bitcoin has scarcity due to network effect lead and \u201cun-tamper-ability\u201d.\n\nThe Lindy effect will only make it stronger as day after day it doesn\u2019t die. It can\u2019t be eradicated, just like a cancer that has spread too far.\n\nThe copies cannot compete with this. It needs the majority to not only leave Bitcoin, but mostly leave to the same choice. There are thousands of choices, so those few people that abandon Bitcoin will not all go to the same choice. In other words, defectors will disperse, not concentrate. The only way this could theoretically happen is if there is some fatal flaw with Bitcoin, AND it can\u2019t be fixed, AND an altcoin can, AND only one altcoin can.\n\nE.g. let\u2019s say Bitcoin\u2019s privacy weakness (really it\u2019s a trade off, not a weakness and any other coin with privacy just chooses a different trade off) is suddenly critical and everyone is exiting. Where will they go? Monero, Zcash, DASH, some to ETH and XRP (not private btw), Cardano\u2026. Can they all be money? Money printer go brrrr much?\n\nSo how else can an Altcoin take over? Remember that people will save in the best money. An Altcoin must become fundamentally better. In the open source world, how is that possible? It\u2019s like thinking it\u2019s possible for a better operating system to exist than the dominant open source one today (GNU Linux). The open source leader just gets better and better. All new ideas get absorbed.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine another currency finds a good use case. Let\u2019s say smart contracts. First that\u2019s like saying paper is money and valuable because contracts can be written on it. No, you need to make good money first, not find other uses for it. Aluminium has more uses than gold but it\u2019s less valuable because it is not money. It can\u2019t be money because it is not scarce. But even if smart contracts makes a cryptocurrency into good money, there are too many: ETH, Cardano, TRON, Iota, probably others.\n\nAs soon as any becomes valuable, it will invite competition and it will be copied. There is no scarcity. For goodness sake, ETH doesn\u2019t even work yet. Its Turing completeness is not even used. Bitcoin has smart contract capability and I understand nearly everything ETH is doing program-wise can be done with Bitcoin. Let\u2019s face it, it is competing with Bitcoin as a money and is far far behind and has no credibility. What will Vitalik Buterin do with the monetary policy next?\n\nETH is just another fiat with a central banker. That is not a true cryptocurrency. Remember why Bitcoin was born \u2013 we are fighting central banking and trying to separate money and state, not shoot ourselves in the foot by losing focus, trying to get rich by improving on the solution we already miraculously discovered. Bitcoin is that: a miracle \u2013 and we should embrace it.\n\nAlso, you mention ROI. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist so you can buy it and sell it for more fiat later. It is a REPLACEMENT for fiat. You buy and NEVER sell. You spend once it achieves its true value. You don\u2019t need an exit strategy. You just save in Bitcoin. With alts, you need to time your exit and sell to a greater fool, because alts are scams, holding forever will get you rekt. Just DCA Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s like picking up gold off the ground before anyone else realises it will become money. Don\u2019t pick up pebbles or seashells (alts), your pockets have limited space. Finally, the most important problem to solve is separating money and state. All other problems are tiny in comparison. We don\u2019t need to replace the legal system with smart contracts. We don\u2019t need a token for everything. We don\u2019t need to put bananas on a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is an invention that solves a humanitarian problem. Altcoins take a solution (blockchain) and try to find a problem. Remember that.",

If you Google about digital wallets, you will see many results where they claim that a digital wallet is an analogue of a physical wallet: It stores, sends, and receives cryptocurrency. When you define it like that, you end up with many forensics investigators who seize a suspect's laptop and think that if they keep the laptop turned off, suspect's cryptocurrencies stay in the laptop because they are stored in their wallet. I met more than 10 people like this. So we should be clear that a wallet does not store Bitcoin, it is stored in the blockchain.\n\nRegarding 7: A multiplication for an algebraic group (or field) is defined on group (field) elements.

                    "response": "> Digital wallets do NOT store your cryptocurrencies. They simply store your private/public keys\n\nAnd addresses. Public keys are not addresses. This oversight point to a flaw in your research. You've never made a Bitcoin transaction  \n\nYou read what you read, and then one day you open up a wallet file to see what's inside. There's always a list of transactions. The wallet's role is to store everything necessary to make it convenient to build and sign a transaction. It's not convenient to reach out to the node network for a transaction history every few minutes  \n\nIt's true, the coins are stored on the public blockchain. The wallet also stores transaction history, so it contains a copy of every coin relevant to all the wallet's addresses\n\n> secp256k1 is NOT a NIST Curve\n\nIt is a SEC curve, but not one of the SEC curves recommended by NIST for use by USA government agencies. \"NIST curve\" is ambiguous nonsense\n\n> A transactions simply changes the ownership of coins and writes this info to the blockchain\n\nI think the white paper gives this impression, but this is one element where Bitcoin diverges from the wording in the white paper  \n\nA Bitcoin transaction spends one or more coins, and creates one or more new coins. Change of ownership is not coded anywhere in the software. A coin can only be spent once, can only be spent completely, no partial spends. A Bitcoin coin has a simple history. It is created, it is spent, in that order  \n\n.  \n\nYour Ethereum factoids are also incomplete. Ethereum may or may not change to proof-of-stake, depending on whether the continuously delayed project eventually succeeds, or is eventually abandoned as a bad idea. Ethereum may also follow through on an announced intention to limit the total supply",

Here's how it works: your cold storage is just a private key, and one or more addresses to receive BTC.  Only you have the private key, and it allows the funds to be transferred *out* of the receive addresses.\n\nIt's kind of tricky to get your head out of the \"money in a bank account\" analogy, and into the \"money on the bank's ledger, allocated to my account\" analogy, and the fact that we use the term \"wallet\" makes it even harder.  But remember that no one possesses any Bitcoin - they just possess a private key that allows the BTC to be transferred out of one or more addresses.\n\nSo, your Coinbase and your cold storage will each have receive addresses you can send to - in that way, they're basically the same.  However, Coinbase is never going to divulge your own private key to you, because it isn't really yours, in the same way \"your\" dollars in \"your\" bank account aren't really \"yours\", but just an allocation on the bank's ledger.\n\nAs far as fees, there will be a fee each time you make a transaction.  It's not very expensive, unless the network is very congested.  But you can cut your fees in half if you transfer only once instead of twice, as long as Robinhood is giving you an actual address to send your BTC to.\n\nI'm not expert on the tax implications but I can't imagine any reason you'd be taxed more by virtue of transferring it twice rather than just once.  Having said that, no reason to transfer twice if you don't have to.\n\nI hope that's a little helpful!",

You can generate seed, export your watch-only skeleton wallet file into your software wallet of choice. Then, using a microSD card, you can load a partially signed bitcoin transaction generated by your software wallet of choice ( I use Electrum on my PC, connected to my own full node), sign it back by plugging the SDCard to the Coldcard reader, and broadcast the transaction back on the software wallet. All while your Coldcard is only connected on your phone charger. Its pretty awesome. You can also use it with a microUSB cable for convenience like you would use a Ledger and such.

Make sure to note your seed phrase and place somewhere safe, not online! I suggest the metal punches.... Make sure you also store your cold wallet somewhere safe from damage! Like a safe or safety deposit box, or create 2 back ups and place 1 in each location....Self custody is the safest from cyber criminals but it comes with risks as well!\n\nAlso and this is big... DO NOT buy your cold wallet off Amazon, eBay or anywhere 2nd hand, buy direct from source. \n\nAlso, if you can DCA into your coin, if you want it fast do it daily, if not in a huge rush, weekly and just divide the total by the speed of entry...for example you want the whole coin before the end of this month? $2100USD/day. Helps even your entry. Just a suggestion. \n\nHope that helps",

Maybe check out this YouTube vid on hardware wallets. Worth subscribing to Coin Bureau as Guy has great and honest crypto content, news and info.\nhttps://youtu.be/_t3Brlb0qzQ\nIf you are able to purchase btc directly through a local service that allows bank deposits then it simplifies matters and you can avoid exchanges. Use one that deposits your btc directly into your btc addresses, that you provide. Consider storing your hardware wallet seed keys on multiple password encrypted USB flash drives. And store them in multiple physical locations. \nOnly buy hardware wallets from the manufacturer. Use Wikipedia to verify all crypto products web addresses, like https://trezor.io\nOnce you've successfully stored your keys and have a small amount of btc in your hardware wallet, then reset (clear/delete) your hardware wallet. Then restore it using your backed up seed keys. This is for peace of mind and confidence for if/when you lose your hardware wallet. If you accumulate a lot of funds then consider setting up a new set of seed keys and wallets. Perhaps on a different brand of hardware wallet. Like Ledger.\nGood luck. And welcome to the world of self custodial finance. Where you get to be the adult, and the rewards and consequences that come with that responsibility. \nSet up dollar cost averaging using your hardware wallet address/es. You don't need the hardware wallet for deposits. In fact once you have the addresses you can store the hardware wallet away in a safe and not easy to get to place. To check transactions and balances yous your btc address/es with an online block explorer.",

If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for SATs. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://amber.app/calculate-your-investment/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference.\n\nNow, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at etoro, RH, PayPal or similar, get the real thing.

Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. \n\nThis little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful.

It's not like a password reset.\n\nLike I mentioned, if the exchange is shut down and your BTC is with the exchange, you may not be able to get it back, but if you moved your BTC off the exchange and are accessing it via your Ledger, it will live on the blockchain forever. \n\nPeople will argue one way or another as to when it makes sense to use a cold wallet, so DYOR.

So if you hold BTC via your own non-custodial wallet, it means you are holding the keys to your own BTC vault.\n\n- When you leave your BTC exposure in an exchange / custodial account, the BTC stays under the control of the exchange / custodian. In some cases it stays in their vault, whereas in some cases they may lend it out to third parties to profit from some interests.  What you retain is a promise by the exchange / custodian that you are the beneficiary for some of the BTC under their control.\n\n- You might feel leaving you BTC exposure with an exchange is similar to leaving stocks with a stockbroker or leaving fiat with a bank.  However, BTC is not regulated like a security, and exchanges are not regulated like banks.  Thus although conceptually somewhat similar, the risks involved with leaving BTC with a third party is significantly higher.\n\n- One example - if your account is assessed by their system as tripping some internal rules the exchange has implemented, you can find that your access to the account and the holdings within suddenly suspended pending investigations.  If the trigger was regulatory related, often they won\u2019t (can\u2019t) even tell you _why_ the suspension occurred and all you could do is wait and hope that their investigations will eventually conclude it\u2019s a false alarm and you account will then be unsuspended, days/weeks/months later.  Leaving substantial BTC in an exchange account exposes your holdings to the ongoing risk of being caught up by the evolving rules that the exchange implements to meet their own reasons.",

Lose both and, unless you remember your seed phrase by heart, you\u2019ve lost your BTC.

Just look at Mt Gox hack.  That was the first of many hacks that have happened.  Also, when you leave your crypto keys on a exchange, you are asking a third party to keep your crypto safe.  as others have said and will say\" not your keys, not your coin\"",

What if they feel like it\u2019s not quite as important as gaining new customers. What if they\u2019re caught lacking?\n\nNow that I\u2019m off the exchange, I have a peace of mind. It\u2019s very very easing to think, I don\u2019t NEED to check up on it. I have my seed phrase with me and if anything happens, I\u2019ll just re establish my relationship with my crypto by simply using the phrases. \n\nNow, I have the privilege of time. What I mean by that is I dont have exchange apps on my phone. I\u2019m not constantly checking prices. On DCA days, I quickly log in and buy some crypto to get my dopamine fix. Done, done, and done.

We'll call it \"Property Tax\". - 1.1%\n\nAdd to that, that if I have major expenses, on let's say the house, I can't deduct that from my taxes unless it's more than x percentage of my total income.\n\nYes, this is a gross oversimplification but it serves to make a point.\n\nThe 1% on the other hand, have their incomes and properties, hidden as Company assets, which enables them to deduct every little expense they can think of.\n\nAnd if they do get caught, they get off with a \"settlement\". if we get caught, our property is taken away, or we get thrown in jail for something like \"Tax Evasion\" or \"Tax Fraud\".\n\nNow, I know what you're going to say - \"Vote and make your voice heard\", but that doesn't work if the people in charge of the government determine who gets to run.\n\nYou think that's just conspiracy talk? Then why is it, that every politician that is voted into office, never follows through with their major campaign promises? Sure, they will throw us scraps, but that's about it. They are all members of the same club.\n\nWhy is it, that when the economy goes to crap, the majority of the bail-out money, goes to Corporations and banks, which caused the issue in the first place? And then after receiving the bailouts, these same Corporations turn around and announce huge layoffs, and/or moving production facilities out of the country. Hell, even the stimulus checks, were routed through the banks, so they could get their cut of that money, due to \"Fee's\"\n\nAll this is to say, yes, this is the Capitalist way, but just because a person wants to play the same game the 1% play, does not mean that person is a \"Fuk\".  It simply means he refuses to be milked by the 1% without trying to fight back.",

I'm surprised that you found it and started using it, there are now a bunch of better ones including their own Phoenix Wallet which is miles better for everyone.\n\nYou can think of Eclair as an experimental wallet, testing the waters, seeing what can and can not be done etc. The reason it still exists is probably because there are still some enthusiasts using it and maybe the company never thought to take it down.",

Surely someone who can understand the latter has 0 confusion over the former?\n\nIs your audience general, or do they have a background in cryptography already?\n\nIf the former, perhaps strike out #5, #7, #8, #9, #10 - that's just not needed.  And #6 isn't so much a misconception as it is a diverse topic, because you are already not focusing on Bitcoin alone based on your course title, I presume.  Once you count other cryptos, you will find that actually ASIC mining is the outlier, not the standard.\n\nAbout the BTC focus - I think #3 is wrong for some non-UTXO cryptos.  And the way you have written it, your clause \"**since** wallets do not store your coins\" makes it sound like the reason a transaction doesn't send/receive coins is precisely because of the wallet's structure.  Well that isn't true.  It is because of the UTXO nature of Bitcoin and other currencies that a transaction changes ownership of existing UTXOs rather than \"sending\" them somewhere.  The wallets for *all* cryptocurrencies don't store coins, because a wallet is as you point out elsewhere a keypair with some sugar, hook to the blockchain, and UI poured on top of it.  The tokens are on the blockchain just like my $ is in the bank's database despite me having my bank's app on my phone to see it and interact with it (god willing).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt almost seems like your list isn't really \"misconceptions\" but \"miscellany\".  Even the 21m BTC item is on your list as a trivia point relative to ETH rather than a myth clarification (the myth being, \"Anybody can just change the software and make more BTC\" or \"How do I *know* there's only going to be 21m?  Who decides?\")\n\nIf that's the case, consider separating it into categories of miscellany like \"Cryptography in Bitcoin\", \"Economic factors behind mining\", \"NFTs and who the fuck cares really ;)\", and \"Token growth schedules, burning, and the merits therein\".\n\nIf going for true myths, check out the Bitcoin wiki for examples to get the juices flowing.",

Your clustering of topics was confusing for me to read through, even as an educator in the space, but now I get that you were intending to kind of \"checklist\" all the statements you were making that you wanted community validation on.\n\nI would really recommend, given this spread of topics and the amount of time you have available to cover it, that you link each new concept with a real world example that the students can follow up with. For some of these, like forks, a more anthropological view (Bitcoin blocksize wars or ETH rollback after the DAO hack) would be appropriate; for others like multisig, a hands-on experiment setting up multisigs on Bitcoin testnet and having students try to \"behave maliciously\" would be great.\n\nFinally, if you haven't already thought of this, doing a test run on your modules with a single listener of approx the same technical level as your pupils, and scribbling down any questions they have which indicate gaps in your explanation, can be super helpful with such a complex interdisciplinary topic.\n\nThanks for clarifying, and happy teaching!",

                    "response": "https://armantheparman.com/why-bitcoin-only/\n\nI want to start by stressing that it all comes down to scarcity. Without scarcity, cryptocurrency may as well be fiat. Good money is scarce. The biggest weakness of cryptocurrencies is that they can be created easily from nothing. All alts are like this. But Bitcoin is different. It has miraculously been born and has gained a huge lead in network effects. This can not be copied. Thus, it has gained scarcity. It is extremely decentralised, and has by far the greatest hashing power on the planet, and distribution of full nodes, which makes it not possible to tamper with the monetary policy. Bitcoin has scarcity due to network effect lead and \u201cun-tamper-ability\u201d.\n\nThe Lindy effect will only make it stronger as day after day it doesn\u2019t die. It can\u2019t be eradicated, just like a cancer that has spread too far.\n\nThe copies cannot compete with this. It needs the majority to not only leave Bitcoin, but mostly leave to the same choice. There are thousands of choices, so those few people that abandon Bitcoin will not all go to the same choice. In other words, defectors will disperse, not concentrate. The only way this could theoretically happen is if there is some fatal flaw with Bitcoin, AND it can\u2019t be fixed, AND an altcoin can, AND only one altcoin can.\n\nE.g. let\u2019s say Bitcoin\u2019s privacy weakness (really it\u2019s a trade off, not a weakness and any other coin with privacy just chooses a different trade off) is suddenly critical and everyone is exiting. Where will they go? Monero, Zcash, DASH, some to ETH and XRP (not private btw), Cardano\u2026. Can they all be money? Money printer go brrrr much?\n\nSo how else can an Altcoin take over? Remember that people will save in the best money. An Altcoin must become fundamentally better. In the open source world, how is that possible? It\u2019s like thinking it\u2019s possible for a better operating system to exist than the dominant open source one today (GNU Linux). The open source leader just gets better and better. All new ideas get absorbed.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine another currency finds a good use case. Let\u2019s say smart contracts. First that\u2019s like saying paper is money and valuable because contracts can be written on it. No, you need to make good money first, not find other uses for it. Aluminium has more uses than gold but it\u2019s less valuable because it is not money. It can\u2019t be money because it is not scarce. But even if smart contracts makes a cryptocurrency into good money, there are too many: ETH, Cardano, TRON, Iota, probably others.\n\nAs soon as any becomes valuable, it will invite competition and it will be copied. There is no scarcity. For goodness sake, ETH doesn\u2019t even work yet. Its Turing completeness is not even used. Bitcoin has smart contract capability and I understand nearly everything ETH is doing program-wise can be done with Bitcoin. Let\u2019s face it, it is competing with Bitcoin as a money and is far far behind and has no credibility. What will Vitalik Buterin do with the monetary policy next?\n\nETH is just another fiat with a central banker. That is not a true cryptocurrency. Remember why Bitcoin was born \u2013 we are fighting central banking and trying to separate money and state, not shoot ourselves in the foot by losing focus, trying to get rich by improving on the solution we already miraculously discovered. Bitcoin is that: a miracle \u2013 and we should embrace it.\n\nAlso, you mention ROI. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist so you can buy it and sell it for more fiat later. It is a REPLACEMENT for fiat. You buy and NEVER sell. You spend once it achieves its true value. You don\u2019t need an exit strategy. You just save in Bitcoin. With alts, you need to time your exit and sell to a greater fool, because alts are scams, holding forever will get you rekt. Just DCA Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s like picking up gold off the ground before anyone else realises it will become money. Don\u2019t pick up pebbles or seashells (alts), your pockets have limited space. Finally, the most important problem to solve is separating money and state. All other problems are tiny in comparison. We don\u2019t need to replace the legal system with smart contracts. We don\u2019t need a token for everything. We don\u2019t need to put bananas on a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is an invention that solves a humanitarian problem. Altcoins take a solution (blockchain) and try to find a problem. Remember that.",

If you Google about digital wallets, you will see many results where they claim that a digital wallet is an analogue of a physical wallet: It stores, sends, and receives cryptocurrency. When you define it like that, you end up with many forensics investigators who seize a suspect's laptop and think that if they keep the laptop turned off, suspect's cryptocurrencies stay in the laptop because they are stored in their wallet. I met more than 10 people like this. So we should be clear that a wallet does not store Bitcoin, it is stored in the blockchain.\n\nRegarding 7: A multiplication for an algebraic group (or field) is defined on group (field) elements. When you say 4P, you are not multiplying two points of an elliptic curve because P is a point but 4 is just an integer there. You are just adding P to itself 4 times.",

This oversight point to a flaw in your research. You've never made a Bitcoin transaction  \n\nYou read what you read, and then one day you open up a wallet file to see what's inside. There's always a list of transactions. The wallet's role is to store everything necessary to make it convenient to build and sign a transaction. It's not convenient to reach out to the node network for a transaction history every few minutes  \n\nIt's true, the coins are stored on the public blockchain. The wallet also stores transaction history, so it contains a copy of every coin relevant to all the wallet's addresses\n\n> secp256k1 is NOT a NIST Curve\n\nIt is a SEC curve, but not one of the SEC curves recommended by NIST for use by USA government agencies. \"NIST curve\" is ambiguous nonsense\n\n> A transactions simply changes the ownership of coins and writes this info to the blockchain\n\nI think the white paper gives this impression, but this is one element where Bitcoin diverges from the wording in the white paper  \n\nA Bitcoin transaction spends one or more coins, and creates one or more new coins. Change of ownership is not coded anywhere in the software. A coin can only be spent once, can only be spent completely, no partial spends. A Bitcoin coin has a simple history. It is created, it is spent, in that order  \n\n.  \n\nYour Ethereum factoids are also incomplete. Ethereum may or may not change to proof-of-stake, depending on whether the continuously delayed project eventually succeeds, or is eventually abandoned as a bad idea. Ethereum may also follow through on an announced intention to limit the total supply",

The whole point of gaming is enjoying your playtime.  \n\n\nSo if you use your money to purchase items in a game here are some issues that immediately pop up for me:  \n1) you have an unfair advantage in the game based on your economic status, as items in games give you stats.  This makes games less fun when you have to go up against rich players. \n\n2) buying items from other players reduces potential revenue from game developers used to make games.  The game developers need money to build teams that produce fun games.\n\n3) Games are not meant to be work, they are meant to be fun. Working to win something in a game is intended to be fun. The reward is the satisfaction from accomplishment, not the item itself. Games are meant to be enjoyed, not monetized. If you change this, you're changing the design incentives. Games will become less fun if they're designed as money schemes.",

That's not the main use case for NFTs in games. \n\nHe probably isn't aware that one of the main use cases for NFTs in the gaming industry is to be able to track ownership of digital games through an NFT marketplace whereby each time a \"used\" digital game is exchanged from one person to the next, the game studio gets a cut of the transaction as per the guidelines established in the smart contract. This is huge for game companies and devs as it allows them to make money on used game purchases. \n\nThere's an enormous amount of NFT FUD flying hot these days. \n\nThat said, I'm not a gamer nor do I follow the gaming industry or NFT space closely.

Does he realize that you can sell smooth love potion(SLP) on an exchange for USD? I was never able to sell anything in World of warcraft for anything in the real world without breaking the ToS. \n\nThere are even Blockchain games that split 50% of the profit in game with players of the game. Instead of profits going to the investors of a major game studio, profits can be distributed to the users actually playing the game. \n\nAll new things are scary, but we should look at them with curiosity and see the positive potential instead of always dwelling on the negative potential.",

The more people who understand the problems pointed out here the better we can start building solutions and being more informed as users.   \n\nSome of the issues are solved by users improving their understanding. For instance the parts of an NFT that are non fungible are defined in that NFTs smart contract. What is not changeable is the history of that token. This unchangeable history is part of how we verify that an NFT is authentic. \n\nMany of the issues mentioned here are solved by blockchains that do not charge a transaction fee.\n\nThe only point I take some issue with is about deflation.

It is adversarial in that it incentivises people to compete with one another and relies nothing on any good faith. It leaves no room for people to abuse or misappropriate power over others because everyone is too busy competing with each other.\n\nIt might be easy to think of any failed attempts to mine a block as wasted energy, but consider that if you spend a bunch of time searching your home for those car keys and it takes about 20 minutes to find them, is the 19 minutes of searching between the sofa cushions that the keys were not in, and searching beneath the table it was not under... is that wasted time, or just part of the process? If you hadn't eliminated those places, would you have found the keys by magic?\n\nComparing Bitcoin to VISA is stupid. In fact, I understand why people keep comparing power usage to transactions (not sure why they ignore the lightning network though), because it is common to lose sight of what the energy usage is for. It has NOTHING to do with creating, broadcasting or validating transactions, it is only about confirming them. The fact that TPS can be scaled in layer 2 without requiring more power is exact proof that there is no correlation between transactions and power usage. It is about the security, and by that measure it should be compared to the energy used to hire, shelter and pay engineers to monitor the system, it should be compared to all of the work done behind the scenes to ensure that settlements are completed to banking standards by using old technology, it should include the energy used to protect the system through war and international threats because all money is competing, but the dollar keeps its position by war and threats of war.\n\nFinally to justify the bankings energy use by declaring that the banking system is used by millions (forgetting that it disenfranchises the majority of them), and by contrasting that to the users of Bitcoin as druggies and gamblers, is bad faith.

I need to get this sorted out so i can buy in the next couple of days before the price starts to climb.\n\nBest start possible, IMHO. \n\n\n> 1) Exchanges: based on ease of use, transaction speed and fee structure, which are the best to buy and why? Is it easy to transfer cash to it and any things to be aware of?\n\nhttps://bullbitcoin.com/ or https://fastbitcoins.com/\n\nI also read about Shakepay, giving free sats daily.\n\n\n> 2) Storage: I have Metamask for a couple NFTs, but not sure if it's secure enough for Bitcoin...? \n\nMetamask is a wallet to store shitcoins, not to secure Bitcoin. Shitcoins are NOT in the same category as Bitcoin and the best way to lose your money. Many of us have been there and I would say, stick to **Bitcoin only** for a couple of years, before you learn more. In that time, many of the currently promising coins will be added to this list: https://99bitcoins.com/deadcoins/\n\n\n> I was thinking a hardware wallet seems like the most secure. I've looked at Ledger Nano S ($99) and Ledge Nano X ($199) \n\nI would rather choose a wallet that's fully open source. Like Trezor or BitBox02.\n\n\nI'm not living in Canada so can't answer the tax questions but this guy might.

It would just be a waste of resources to store tickets on the blockchain without any use after the event.    \n\\- University certificates need to be stored on some server, only the pointer to the certificate can be stored on the blockchain. I feel it's the same as a university having its own database or outsourcing it to a third party.  \n\\- Blockchain is not backed by law. Having a record of possessing real-life property on the blockchain doesn't isolate it from the government. The government will always trust its own database over the blockchain.

(I heard its an expensive process but with the use of magnets or something, you can restore your hard drive even if formatted)\n\nyes, but pick very pro one and don't tell them what is there. maybe even pay extra to be there when they do it? if there is few million $ it will be tempting to steal it and tell you nothing was recovered etc\n\n3) 3) I had a powerful graphics card in 2009, how many bitcoins can someone have mined in 2009 per day given the low amount of mining back then with a top of the line video card? ( I was mining every day for maybe a few weeks or a month)\n\nif you CPU mined you might obtain like 50 - 1000 Bitcoins.\n\nBe aware, people will contact you in private messages now, trying to scam you, link you to viruses and so on, to try to steal it.",

Firstly, find a good accountant and a good lawyer. \n\nGood luck.",

This restore works independendly of the software or Hardware Wallet used to generate it originally.\nYou don't have one. Instead, you have the already mentioned \"random\" File on your old computer, usually called wallet.dat, as others have told you.\n\nFor Recovery of the old coins, you'd typically first get a new Hardware Wallet and generate a new seed phrase on it. Keep these words safe and hidden.\nThen you'd transfer the coins from the old wallet to the new. This is the \"Dangerous\" step, considering the amount of money most likely involved. I'm not sure of the safest way to do this, but you'll want to do it offline for sure.",

This newer method uses 12 or more *seed words* along with an optional *pass phrase* (sometimes called Seed Phrases).  The seed words can generate deterministically an infinite set of public (i.e., bitcoin addresses) and their private keys.  Clever stuff really, so you should consider adopting this new method using a hardward wallet or airgapped machin if you find anything of value.\n\nGood luck to you, by the way!",

                    "response": "OP heads back home after dealing with the loss of his father and civil suits. Has to grunge through numerous items left in storage for several years. He thinks, \"did I let someone use my computer or did I really leave it in storage\". He hopes the latter.\n\nAs he is going down memory lane of all his older belongings boxed up and sitting idle for years, he sees a box with \"electronics\" written on the side in black marker. He gets jittery, scuffling through the other boxes and items in his way. He grabs it by the corners, gripping it with all his might. The weight feels right for a computer to be in there, he thinks to himself.\n\nHe makes his way back to where he was sitting, going through other boxes. He clears a little area and sets the box on the ground in front of him running his hands around the edge of the lid. He closes his eyes and says, please be in there. As he slowly raises the lid, an orange glow comes from inside. He thinks he is hallucinating and quickly jerks the lid away seeing it there, sitting on top of all those older electronic devices that look ancient now.\n\nHe pulls it out and sets it on his lap, running his fingers around the lid to open the screen. He thinks, should I wait until I'm home to power it on, or just go ahead right now? The anticipation is wrecking him. He reaches for the power button, 'click'.\n\nNothing happens for several seconds, then the laptop logo appears on the screen and to the OS loading. He can't believe it, after all this time. Still enough battery to turn on. The loading screen finishes and he's prompted to put in his password.\n\nUsername: \nPassword:\n\nAs he goes to type what he thinks it should be the screen goes black. The batteries had just enough juice left to power on but not enough to keep on. He sets the laptop aside rummaging through the box with \"electronics\" written on the side in black marker. He's panicking because he can't find the power adapter for the computer. Then like a needle in a haystack, of all the black cables balled in a tangled mess, he finds the right one!\n\nHe looks around for an outlet in this storage unit, finding none. He grabs the computer and slings it under his arms clenched this chest, power adapter gripped between his hand, cables dangling by his waist. He leaves the storage unit and clocks up before heading to his car. As he pulls out of the storage unit, there in the passenger seat lies the computer and power adapter.\n\nThe drive home felt like an eternity, he thought to himself, maybe I should just swing into the closest Tim Hortons grab a coffee and use an outlet there. But he decides it might be better to just do this in the privacy of his home.\n\nHe pulls in the driveway, quickly grabbing the computer and power adapter, running inside. The front door flies open and he stands there frantically looking for the nearest outlet and sees it, sticking out like a neon sign next to the dining room table. The next thing we see, the computer sits on the dining room table and the power adapter is plugged into both the outlet and computer.\n\nThis time, we hear a chime as the computer boots up and we are back to the login screen\n\nUsername:\nPassword:\n\nHe starts typing what he thinks it should be, again, and can you believe it. First try from memory he correctly logged in, even after all these years. After the loading screen finishes and fades away, there he sees it. The Bitcoin core application icon, sitting on his desktop. He brings the cursor over the icon, and closes his eyes as he clicks to launch the application.\n\nHis eyes open and there he sees, in a little window titled Bitcoin Core -Wallet:\n\nBalances\nAvailable:  5450.31700000 BTC\nPending:    0.00000000 BTC\n\nTotal:         5450.31700000 BTC",

This risk of data decay increases the longer an HDD is kept in storage. The good news is that if the data is indeed stored on the device, cosmic ray damage is unlikely to corrupt it to an extent that it's unrecoverable. So as the previous commenter said, it may be helpful to look into a professional data restoration service (make sure they are a legitimate business and you have a contract in place). Perhaps even better, have the data restorer open your HDD from the beginning to avoid unintentional further damage. It could be a thousand dollars that you spend in order to recover millions. Best of luck and hope you succeed.",

I think it was around 2010 when the first GPU miner appeared. It could have been late 2009 though.\n\nIn any case, if you actually mined something in 2009 then you would have at least 50 bitcoins, which is pretty sweet. Depending on how early you were mining, you could have thousands of bitcoin waiting for you.\n\nTo get it, make sure the pc is disconnected from the internet, turn it on, then export the keys with something like this:\n\n> bitcoin-cli dumpwallet wallet_data.txt\n\nThe file wallet_data.txt will have all your private keys, just write them down with pen and paper (don't take photos or write them on an internet connected device), and import that into a modern wallet.\n\nEnjoy being rich!",

Sorry to hear about your father. \n\nAn important thing is to take it slowly and make sure you've got the steps correct and understand them. Don't connect to the internet on your old machine. Find some good sources and follow the steps to safely recover the data. \n\nIf you're using a USB thumb drive to transfer anything make sure you purchase a brand new one out of the box to ensure there's no malware on an existing USB thumb drive. \n\nA hard drive back up is a good idea. \n\nOnce in window you can use the windows finder to search for \".dat\" or \"wallet.dat\"\n\nIf you find it immediately make a copy of it on a different brand new thumb drive that you will not connect to a computer with internet. Then you can go on to explore how to extract the coins!\n\nIf you do need to get the hard drive recovered because of a reformat, tell the person there is holiday photos on the drive you are looking to recover, something other than what you are actually doing. \n\nBest of luck to you!",

Remove any remaining public keys with 0 BTC assuming those got spent.\n\nThat will leave a subset, hopefully very small, of which one should be yours. \n\nAnyone who knows what I'm talking about - am I out to lunch?",

Capture everything on video (but of course dont ever show the screen or your location and make sure to strip the video of location (EXIF) data). After all the dust settles you will have an AMAZING YouTube documentary with Millions of clicks and everybody can see this amazing story. Also it will start your YouTuber career if you want to because a normal job is maybe not necessary anymore! Good luck, I'd love to see this at least :)",

Sometimes it can be an easy recovery (if your computer will turn on easily). Just do your own DD, find an expert. Hire an attorney and have the computer tech do all shits in front of you and your lawyer. Always nice to have another computer tech (unknown to each other) sitting and watching right there. I know it sounds a lot but you might as well spend 20k on these kind of shit to possibly make millions. Good luck. I hope you will find. Again be careful given your situation who has been going thru massive amount of law suites.",

I only ask this because I tried to go to the bitcoin website and it says I need to log in. There were no accounts back then, it was just a client on my computer.\n\nYou're probably hitting bitcoin.com, a scam website that took over\n\n> 2)In the case that I formatted my computer (which i do not recall if i did or not), can I get my hard drive professionally restored saving my potential private keys to restore my coins? (I heard its an expensive process but with the use of magnets or something, you can restore your hard drive even if formatted)\n\nA \"simple\" reformat might be recoverable, but in general you're out of luck.\n\n> 3) I had a powerful graphics card in 2009, how many bitcoins can someone have mined in 2009 per day given the low amount of mining back then with a top of the line video card? ( I was mining every day for maybe a few weeks or a month)\n\n\u200bNone, GPU mining wasn't invented yet. CPU mining would have done quite a bit of mining in 2009.",

It's like watching TV, but without the TV.  \n\nSit still, in a room without interruptions (you might sit in the shower if your home is full of interruptions/other people/noises).  \n\nFocus on one thing.  Some like to stare at candle flame.  I like to close my eyes and listen to the sound of the shower water.  \n\nLet your thoughts go silent.  This part can take a few days to learn, or maybe you'll get it right away.  Focus on your \"one thing\" and be silent inside.  If you find yourself thinking about anything else, just let it go.  It's okay, keep letting it go.  It becomes easy within a few days.  If there's a song in your head, let it go.  If it comes back, let it go.  Focus on your one thing.  \n\nBreathe all the way in, then exhale fully and slowly.  As you exhale, relax your muscles.  Some people like to start by relaxing their feet, ankles, legs... face, scalp, or the reverse.  Keep taking deep breaths.  Keep relaxing, keep your focus on your \"one thing\".  \n\nThat's it.\n\nSit down, breathe, relax, focus...  It is important to do this every day for several days.  You'll see what I mean.  You'll eventually find yourself in a wonderful, blissful state - your breathing will automatically be very deep, you'll be more relaxed than you knew was possible.  Your ability to focus will increase.  \n\nSo, how does this help you to not spend/sell your Bitcoin?  When you feel the urge, you'll be able to sit down, take a deep breath, relax, and focus on your \"one thing\" (even if you have to imagine its there).  That is, over time, you will replace your bad habit/thought-pattern with something healthy.  \n\nIt's called the Relaxation Response.  You condition yourself to relax.  \n\nPrice of Bitcoin changes a lot, deep breath, relax, nobody is going to harm you, not even you.  \n\nThis ability, as you'll find, comes in handy in all kinds of situations.  \n\nThing is, you can't start learning to relax while you're in a stress situation -- you must learn to relax in a controlled environment, and then learn to use it in other situations.",

Here is my advice.\n\n1. Make a written plan. I am doing X for Y reasons. Z is my goal. Print this out. Carry this in your pocket. It will make you think before you spend money. \n2. Goals=lifestyle. Having tons of btc and living a life you don't like won't work. Personally my goal is not to have a lambo-it's to have investments that can generate 7,000 month income without touching the principle. That is what keeps me focused.\n3. Your goals should be realistic and I believe being the goal is freedom younger. I'd rather be kind of rich at 42 then really rich at 50. I'm 38. I know 42 year olds who cannot get their time back. Time and freedom is everything. I know people with tons of $ but no plan-you need to have an exit strategy for yourself-this doesn't mean sell-it means a plan. .\n4. Have rewards in your plan-have one vice. Traveling, clothes you like, restaurants, partying-have one vice. Embrace your reward and enjoy life within reason. I know someone who makes $250k a year, has no family, has no vices, and looks at his bank account for happiness. Not a good plan. I also know that the longer I prevented myself from enjoying some wealth the more I would binge.\n5. Trading is very difficult. I have bought options and still once in a while do. Overall it's lost me money. The ultimate trade was buying houses and selling before the crash then rebuying between 09-11. I know ZERO people who did this. Be wary of people who tell trading stories.\n6. There is nothing wrong with exploring trading, but I'd keep it at 5% of your net worth. Assume trading goes to zero and be okay with that.",

                    "response": "If you're interested in the NFTs on altcoin platforms, then you should really understand how those NFTs actually work. So below I will explain how those NFTs on altcoin platforms actually work on a technical level and I will explain why they probably wont even exist in 10 years. I will also explain why some of these NFTs are selling for such high prices.\n\nMany of those NFTs that were sold for crazy high prices were not actually sold to other people. The person buying those expensive NFTs is often the same person who minted the NFT in the first place. I will explain how whales can easily own very expensive rare NFTs for very little cost. They can just mint an NFT and sell it to them self for $500,000 worth of et\u04bb. They will only lose the small percentage that the NFT marketplace takes and now they own a super rare NFT worth $500k and they will still have most of their et\u04bb because they sold the NFT to them self. And there is a small chance that they might be able to to sell that worthless NFT to some fool who believes that it is actually valuable. Doing this also entices more newbies to mint NFTs in the hopes of getting rich.\n\nPeople are now using flash loans to borrow large amounts of et\u04bb to purchase their own NFTs for extremely high prices and pay back the flash loan all in the same block. https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/122516/how-a-cunning-trick-made-it-look-like-a-cryptopunk-sold-for-532-million\n\nHere is another example that can be done. You can mint an NFT and sell it to yourself for $1000, then put it up for sale and buy it from yourself again for $1500, and sell it to yourself another time for $2200. Now you can put this appreciating NFT up for sale and try to sell it to some fool who sees it keeps getting sold for more and thinks that it must be valuable.\n\nThe current NFTs are useful for something. These NFTs are a useful tool for laundering illegally acquired cryptocurrency. Criminals can shift around their ill gotten crypto between different tokens, mint an NFT, and purchase their own NFT with their dirty crypto. Now they've cleaned their dirty crypto and they also own a rare NFT that's supposedly worth a lot of money. I mean just look at how much it sold for!\n\n[It costs anywhere from $70-$500+ to mint an NFT on et\u04bbereum](https://www.supercryptonews.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-mint-an-nft/) depending on where you do it, so they're [hyping shitcoiners/artists/anyone up and luring them into minting crap in the hopes of getting rich](https://fstoppers.com/opinion/nfts-are-pyramid-scheme-and-people-are-already-losing-money-554869) and NFTs are doing a great job of that at the moment. People are blowing millions of dollars worth of et\u04bbereum minting NFTs hoping to hit the NFT lottery and get rich.\n\n**All these NFT tokens being sold on et\u04bbereum right now either point to a URL on the internet, or an IPFS hash. In most circumstances they reference an IPFS gateway on the internet run by the same startup that sold the NFT. That URL also isn't the media. That URL is a JSON metadata file.** The owners of the servers have no obligation to continue storing the media. Now let's take a look at a couple of real NFTs and see how they work on a technical level.\n\nhttps://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/1\n\nThis NFT token is for this JSON file hosted directly on Nifty's servers as shown below: https://api.niftygateway.com/beeple/100010001/\n\nThat file refers to the actual media that was \"bought.\" Which in this case is hosted by Cloudinary CDN, which is served by Nifty's servers again. So if Nifty goes bust, this token is now worthless. It refers to nothing and this can't be changed. \n\nNow we'll take a look at the $69,346,250 Beeple, sold by Christies. It's so expensive. Surely it isn't centralized, right? Wrong, it's pointless: https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924\n\nThat NFT token refers directly to an IPFS hash. We can take that IPFS hash and fetch the JSON metadata using a public gateway: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz\n\nSo well done for referring to IPFS, it references the specific file rather than a URL that might break! **But** the metadata links to: https://ipfsgateway.makersplace.com/ipfs/QmXkxpwAHCtDXbbZHUwqtFucG1RMS6T87vi1CdvadfL7qA\n\nThis is an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com, the same NFT minting startup which will go bust one day.\n\nYou might say \"*just refer to the IPFS hash in both places!*\" But IPFS only serves files as long as a node in the IPFS network **intentionally** keeps hosting it. Which means when the startup who sold you the NFT goes bust, the files will probably vanish from IPFS too. [This is already happening.](https://twitter.com/CheckMyNFT/status/1371960028765245440) There are already [NFTs with IPFS resources that are no longer hosted anywhere.](https://twitter.com/scanlime/status/1371509988179464196)\n\nAnd just pinning the file on your own IPFS node also wont work because the metadata file generally points to a specific HTTP IPFS gateway URL and not the IPFS hash. This means that when the gateway operator goes bust, I can buy the domain and start serving dick pics lol\n\nRight now NFT's are built on an absolute house of cards constructed by the people selling them, and it is likely that every NFT sold on et\u04bbereum so far will be broken within a decade. This creates a pretty solid exit plan for makersplace if they run into financial problems. The people who own the these useless NFTs \"worth\" millions of dollars are going to be pretty motivated to buy the site or fund it. Or someone can buy the bankrupt startup domains and start charging NFT owners to serve their files.",

                    "response": "Although I agree with you in how Bitcoin will evolve in the near-future, I think it has nothing to do with this \"Fat Protocol Thesis\". I see no reason to think that \"value flows from the protocol layer to the application layer\". How are you measuring value to arrive at that conclusion? If you go on the subjective theory of value approach, then value derives from utility. Is the protocol less useful than the applications? Of course not, the dependency is a one-way relation (apps depend on the protocol but the protocol do not depend on them). The more apps are built on it, the more valuable it becomes as more and more people begin using in through the apps.\n\nIf you go the other way, with the classical labor-value theory, it is mostly the same, as the protocol becomes a tool that all the apps rely on, saving hours of hard work. In other words, value.  \nSo, this thesis seems to be implying that the people who made TCP/IP protocol received less money for it than the ones that made the big tech corporations. That is true, as far as I know, but not because of the value of their products per se: in many cases, both apps and protocols are free to use and that is part of their value, paradoxically. Big tech companies have complex and sometimes obscure business models, but essentially they rely on advertising and, ultimately, in actual exchanges of goods and services.  \nThe thing with BITCOIN is not that it reverses this tendency of value flowing from protocol to application, it is that it IS A PROTOCOL FOR VALUE TRANSFER. It creates a virtuous cycle by obtaining more use-value by enabling the transfer of such value between parties.",

I'd also love to hear OP's secrets.  Anyway, your fees have nothing to do with how much you fund with.  You can set your fees to anything you like, even different fees per channel.  If you set them too high, you don't route payments, and if you set them too low you get lots of traffic but very few sats, and your channels get depleted.  I haven't found the sweet spot yet.  \n\nAnyway, my node is for me, I didn't ever intend to make a profit, and I like that my mobile wallet can open a channel to my own node instead of someone else's.",

There is no such thing as \"intrinsic value\".  This assumption has been a plague on economic theory since Marx.  Value is aligned with demonstrated preference.  Human preference is demonstrated through how they act.  For example, people have demonstrated a preference for bitcoin over other uses of capital such as going to a movie.  The other uses to which the capital could have been put are the opportunity costs.  Value is a personal hierarchy of wants.  By demonstrating preference for bitcoin over the dollar (you purchased the bitcoin right?... and not something else) you value bitcoin higher than the dollar.  You \"value\" the bitcoin higher than the dollar.  \n\nThe reason bitcoin is succeeding is because individuals prefer bitcoin against the dollar.  This trend is growing and that is the primary reason bitcoin will replace the dollar.  It just works better to satisfy ends than the dollar does.",

These are small, close-knit communities of like-minded individuals. In fact, these have been emerging since the dawn of the internet which is highly decentralized in nature. The nation state as an organizational unit made sense from the 1600s up to the early 1990s when there was no Internet (and even then they were often run by corrupt, murderous psychopaths). But today it has become nothing more than a parasite that feeds on its population\u2019s capital. The way to starve this beast is to deprive it of what gives it power: centralization. Bitcoin, crypto and the Internet is the answer to that",

I think I'll be just fine in Bitcoin City; **I hope I can make up for some of that lost talent.** \n\nAnd for the politically inclined, I remember a US president calling migrants \"thieves and rapists\",  in reality he was speaking about his stupid orange face, he is a rapist and over here persona non grata, that's why we didn't sell him Greenland! \n\nSo my friends, expect me writing from Bitcoin City in the near future!",

                    "response": "I'm also from El Salvador, and I can provide my perspective on things when it comes to our current issues. First of all, I would like to apologize for my english, it isn't my first language but I hope I'm able to get my point across. \nI've lived in the capital city for my whole life, I'm as middle class as it can get, which means I have a lot of privileges a huge part of our population lacks, but I'm obviously not rich. I'm also 23 years old and I work in the city.\nI'd like to note that in the presidential elections held in 2019, I voted for Nayib Bukele, but during this time I've come to change my mind for a few reasons (I've not been paid to say this. I clarify it because that is one of the arguments that people who support our president liked to say even though it is false most of the time).\n\nNayib Bukele has done a lot of good things which I support, especially during the pandemic, but it doesn't change the fact that he is a populist, that thrives on the ignorance and poverty of our people. He gave people money and food during the pandemic, and of course they were happy because for the first time a government was \"gifting\" them stuff, even though it all comes from our own taxes (which are going to increase in the next year, according to the official General Budget of the Nation), this argument is something that is repeated by people who support this government when we call him out on the corruption that I going on right now: \"everyone steals, but for the first time someone is gifting us stuff\", and even though this aid that was given during the pandemic was necessary, the only reason he did it was to get points from the general population. \nHe also doesn't have an ideology, and his prime enemy is himself, changing his argument every time. I say this because Nayib Bukele has said a lot of things in the past couple of years that are just the opposite of what he is doing right now, and this is because he just does and says what he and his marketing team thinks will work at the moment. \nHe has all the power for nothing, he owns every single instance of the government, meaning he could do anything he wants, and end \"corruption\", but nothing has changed, because he doesn't want to. He blames past governments for everything bad that happens (and it works) even though he's able to do everything to fix it, and if something goes wrong right now is all on him. \nHe's part of the usual politicians in this country, he is corrupted, he doesn't follow legal procedures when it comes to money, specially during the pandemic, they even approved a law commonly known as Alabi's Law, maned ater the Minister of Health, and it is popular for hiding all the purchases during the pandemic, which means we don't know what they used the money on, alloeing the government to grab that money for personal use if they want to and no one would notice. \nWhen it comes to crime, I agree that deaths have been reduced significantly, but that doesn't mean crime has. Recently the news have been filled with disappearances, but they don't count as deaths because no dead body's have been found, even tough they are just hiding the bodies, because the government has a treat with gangs. To understand this you have to know that gangs in this country are some sort of mobs, meaning they have a lot of power, and some of them even are government officials, and they are considered terrorists groups. Past governments negotiated with gangs to reduce homicides, and so does this one, and that's why no many killings have been going on, but recently clandestine graves filled with corpses have been found.\nNayib Bukele used the phrase\"Hay dinero cuando nadie roba\", which roughly translates to \"There's money when  no one is stealing it\", to say that when a government isn't corrupted, there would always be funds to Carry out projects. Now that he's president there is no money to do it, he has to ask for a lot of loans and he's driving the country towards crippling debt. \n\nNow when it comes to Bitcoin becoming legal tender, he first announced it in a foreign country, and not to us, Wich says a lot. He presented a joke of a law to the congress and in less than a day it was approved, but not even the congressman and congresswomen, knew what it really meant. There was  a lot of disinformation around Bitcoin, but it was the government obligation to inform about it, and they didn't do it right, many people thought Bitcoin was going to be an actual physical coin, which is just sad. \nChivo Wallet didn't work properly for a while, and I still don't know if it works, a lot of identities were stolen in that app due to it's low security. Many people didn't use it because it was that bad, and they just singed up to get the money that was given and transferred it to a different wallet, and it just facilitated government surveillance.\nAnother issue is the corruption sorrounding the app.\nBitcoin becoming legal tender doesn't mean is being done right, and that's why there's been a lot of protest against it. \nThe protests have not really been about Bitcoin, but the way that has been handled by the government. \n\nAbout Bitcoin City, is the same thing, we have a lot of issues as a country that at the moment are more urgent.\nI'm a 23 year old woman, with a full time job as a lawyer living in the city, but I can't even afford a house, and I still are more privileged than a huge part of the people living here. \nThe thing about that city is that it is for foreign investors, which is fine, but inequality is increasing everyday, and nothing is being done to fix it. I know it sounds good, but not everyone will get to live there, and the government won't make it a reality for everyone cause we are founding the government with our taxes, they need it.\nAlso a couple years back even Nayib Bukele himself would have been against it, just like he wasn't okay with ZEDES, Wich he called \"the most neoliberal project that has been imposed in our country's history\" and \"just like that, privatizing a territory. Incredible\".",

The problem is global, and even this sub has seen at least one bot account actively pushing lies.\n\nGood to see the corruption is under control, and not like in usa where the media lied for 4 years about Trump, and were complicit in legitimizing stealing the election. Trump and Bukele have some things in common with their political situation when in office.",
