Gresham's Law states that, given two monies with equal face value, people will prefer to spend the money with lesser commodity value and hoard the money with greater commodity value. It was relevant back in the days of bimetallism, when a \"dollar\" was defined both in terms of a mass of silver and in terms of a mass of gold. As the relative market values of gold and silver fluctuated, at various times gold dollars would be under- or over-valued relative to silver dollars, and so the \"bad money\" would drive the \"good money\" out of circulation. Gresham's Law has no application to Bitcoin because bitcoins have no face value by which to be under- or over-valued relative to fiat.",

Surely someone who can understand the latter has 0 confusion over the former?\n\nIs your audience general, or do they have a background in cryptography already?\n\nIf the former, perhaps strike out #5, #7, #8, #9, #10 - that's just not needed.  And #6 isn't so much a misconception as it is a diverse topic, because you are already not focusing on Bitcoin alone based on your course title, I presume.  Once you count other cryptos, you will find that actually ASIC mining is the outlier, not the standard.\n\nAbout the BTC focus - I think #3 is wrong for some non-UTXO cryptos.  And the way you have written it, your clause \"**since** wallets do not store your coins\" makes it sound like the reason a transaction doesn't send/receive coins is precisely because of the wallet's structure.  Well that isn't true.  It is because of the UTXO nature of Bitcoin and other currencies that a transaction changes ownership of existing UTXOs rather than \"sending\" them somewhere.  The wallets for *all* cryptocurrencies don't store coins, because a wallet is as you point out elsewhere a keypair with some sugar, hook to the blockchain, and UI poured on top of it.  The tokens are on the blockchain just like my $ is in the bank's database despite me having my bank's app on my phone to see it and interact with it (god willing).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt almost seems like your list isn't really \"misconceptions\" but \"miscellany\".  Even the 21m BTC item is on your list as a trivia point relative to ETH rather than a myth clarification (the myth being, \"Anybody can just change the software and make more BTC\" or \"How do I *know* there's only going to be 21m?  Who decides?\")\n\nIf that's the case, consider separating it into categories of miscellany like \"Cryptography in Bitcoin\", \"Economic factors behind mining\", \"NFTs and who the fuck cares really ;)\", and \"Token growth schedules, burning, and the merits therein\".\n\nIf going for true myths, check out the Bitcoin wiki for examples to get the juices flowing.",

Good money is scarce. The biggest weakness of cryptocurrencies is that they can be created easily from nothing. All alts are like this. But Bitcoin is different. It has miraculously been born and has gained a huge lead in network effects. This can not be copied. Thus, it has gained scarcity. It is extremely decentralised, and has by far the greatest hashing power on the planet, and distribution of full nodes, which makes it not possible to tamper with the monetary policy. Bitcoin has scarcity due to network effect lead and \u201cun-tamper-ability\u201d.\n\nThe Lindy effect will only make it stronger as day after day it doesn\u2019t die. It can\u2019t be eradicated, just like a cancer that has spread too far.\n\nThe copies cannot compete with this. It needs the majority to not only leave Bitcoin, but mostly leave to the same choice. There are thousands of choices, so those few people that abandon Bitcoin will not all go to the same choice. In other words, defectors will disperse, not concentrate. The only way this could theoretically happen is if there is some fatal flaw with Bitcoin, AND it can\u2019t be fixed, AND an altcoin can, AND only one altcoin can.\n\nE.g. let\u2019s say Bitcoin\u2019s privacy weakness (really it\u2019s a trade off, not a weakness and any other coin with privacy just chooses a different trade off) is suddenly critical and everyone is exiting. Where will they go? Monero, Zcash, DASH, some to ETH and XRP (not private btw), Cardano\u2026. Can they all be money? Money printer go brrrr much?\n\nSo how else can an Altcoin take over? Remember that people will save in the best money. An Altcoin must become fundamentally better. In the open source world, how is that possible? It\u2019s like thinking it\u2019s possible for a better operating system to exist than the dominant open source one today (GNU Linux). The open source leader just gets better and better. All new ideas get absorbed.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine another currency finds a good use case. Let\u2019s say smart contracts. First that\u2019s like saying paper is money and valuable because contracts can be written on it. No, you need to make good money first, not find other uses for it. Aluminium has more uses than gold but it\u2019s less valuable because it is not money. It can\u2019t be money because it is not scarce. But even if smart contracts makes a cryptocurrency into good money, there are too many: ETH, Cardano, TRON, Iota, probably others.\n\nAs soon as any becomes valuable, it will invite competition and it will be copied. There is no scarcity. For goodness sake, ETH doesn\u2019t even work yet. Its Turing completeness is not even used. Bitcoin has smart contract capability and I understand nearly everything ETH is doing program-wise can be done with Bitcoin. Let\u2019s face it, it is competing with Bitcoin as a money and is far far behind and has no credibility. What will Vitalik Buterin do with the monetary policy next?\n\nETH is just another fiat with a central banker. That is not a true cryptocurrency. Remember why Bitcoin was born \u2013 we are fighting central banking and trying to separate money and state, not shoot ourselves in the foot by losing focus, trying to get rich by improving on the solution we already miraculously discovered. Bitcoin is that: a miracle \u2013 and we should embrace it.\n\nAlso, you mention ROI. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist so you can buy it and sell it for more fiat later. It is a REPLACEMENT for fiat. You buy and NEVER sell. You spend once it achieves its true value. You don\u2019t need an exit strategy. You just save in Bitcoin. With alts, you need to time your exit and sell to a greater fool, because alts are scams, holding forever will get you rekt. Just DCA Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s like picking up gold off the ground before anyone else realises it will become money. Don\u2019t pick up pebbles or seashells (alts), your pockets have limited space. Finally, the most important problem to solve is separating money and state. All other problems are tiny in comparison. We don\u2019t need to replace the legal system with smart contracts. We don\u2019t need a token for everything. We don\u2019t need to put bananas on a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is an invention that solves a humanitarian problem. Altcoins take a solution (blockchain) and try to find a problem. Remember that.",

As we need to become more independent from Russian gas, renewable incentives are ever more important.\n> \n> To illustrate the above in a very simplified way, please consider this: Electricity usage of a country is not constant, we could build renewable generators for median usage and supplement with gas and oil at peak hours, or we could build for peak usage, and let excess energy at off peak hours goes into proof-of-work. This shorten the return on investment significantly and give us a way to build enough capacity for tomorrow.\n> \n> Further data:\n> - Global gas flaring (thrown away energy) can power 5.5 time the Bitcoin network\n> - Renewable curtailment (thrown away potential energy at off peak hours) in China alone can run 80% of the Bitcoin network \n> Source: \n> https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index/comparisons\n> \n> Please ask the ECON Committee to oppose Amendments ALT A and ALT G. \n> \n> This is important for the future of renewable, energy innovations and energy independence in Europe\n> \n> Kind regards\n\n**Here is the complete list of all German member emails, just copy paste:**\n\nchristine.anderson@europarl.europa.eu, rasmus.andresen@europarl.europa.eu, katarina.barley@europarl.europa.eu, gunnar.beck@europarl.europa.eu, nicola.beer@europarl.europa.eu, hildegard.bentele@europarl.europa.eu, larspatrick.berg@europarl.europa.eu, stefan.berger@europarl.europa.eu, gabriele.bischoff@europarl.europa.eu, michael.bloss@europarl.europa.eu, damian.BOESELAGER@europarl.europa.eu, patrick.breyer@europarl.europa.eu, markus.buchheit@europarl.europa.eu, klaus.buchner@europarl.europa.eu, udo.bullmann@europarl.europa.eu, delara.burkhardt@europarl.europa.eu, martin.buschmann@europarl.europa.eu, reinhard.buetikofer@europarl.europa.eu, daniel.caspary@europarl.europa.eu, anna.cavazzini@europarl.europa.eu, oezlem.demirel@europarl.europa.eu, anna.deparnay-grunenberg@europarl.europa.eu, christian.doleschal@europarl.europa.eu, lena.duepont@europarl.europa.eu, christian.ehler@europarl.europa.eu, cornelia.ernst@europarl.europa.eu, engin.eroglu@europarl.europa.eu, ismail.ertug@europarl.europa.eu, markus.ferber@europarl.europa.eu, nicolaus.fest@europarl.europa.eu, romeo.franz@europarl.europa.eu, daniel.freund@europarl.europa.eu, michael.gahler@europarl.europa.eu, evelyne.gebhardt@europarl.europa.eu, alexandra.geese@europarl.europa.eu, jens.geier@europarl.europa.eu, helmut.geuking@europarl.europa.eu, sven.giegold@europarl.europa.eu, jens.gieseke@europarl.europa.eu, andreas.glueck@europarl.europa.eu, svenja.hahn@europarl.europa.eu, henrike.hahn@europarl.europa.eu, martin.haeusling@europarl.europa.eu, niclas.herbst@europarl.europa.eu, pierrette.herzberger-fofana@europarl.europa.eu, monika.hohlmeier@europarl.europa.eu, peter.jahr@europarl.europa.eu, petra.kammerevert@europarl.europa.eu, ska.keller@europarl.europa.eu, moritz.koerner@europarl.europa.eu, dietmar.koester@europarl.europa.eu, maximilian.krah@europarl.europa.eu, constanze.krehl@europarl.europa.eu, joachim.kuhs@europarl.europa.eu, sergey.lagodinsky@europarl.europa.eu, bernd.lange@europarl.europa.eu, katrin.langensiepen@europarl.europa.eu, peter.liese@europarl.europa.eu, sylvia.limmer@europarl.europa.eu, norbert.lins@europarl.europa.eu, david.mcallister@europarl.europa.eu, erik.marquardt@europarl.europa.eu, joerg.meuthen@europarl.europa.eu, martina.michels@europarl.europa.eu, marlene.mortler@europarl.europa.eu, ulrike.mueller@europarl.europa.eu, hannah.neumann@europarl.europa.eu, norbert.neuser@europarl.europa.eu, angelika.niebler@europarl.europa.eu, niklas.nienass@europarl.europa.eu, maria.noichl@europarl.europa.eu, jutta.paulus@europarl.europa.eu, markus.pieper@europarl.europa.eu, dennis.radtke@europarl.europa.eu, guido.reil@europarl.europa.eu, terry.reintke@europarl.europa.eu, martin.schirdewan@europarl.europa.eu, christine.schneider@europarl.europa.eu, helmut.scholz@europarl.europa.eu, sven.schulze@europarl.europa.eu, joachim.schuster@europarl.europa.eu, andreas.schwab@europarl.europa.eu, ralf.seekatz@europarl.europa.eu, nico.semsrott@europarl.europa.eu, sven.simon@europarl.europa.eu, birgit.sippel@europarl.europa.eu, martin.sonneborn@europarl.europa.eu, sabine.verheyen@europarl.europa.eu, viola.voncramon@europarl.europa.eu, axel.voss@europarl.europa.eu, marionerika.walsmann@europarl.europa.eu, manfred.weber@europarl.europa.eu, rainer.wieland@europarl.europa.eu, tiemo.woelken@europarl.europa.eu, bernhard.zimniok@europarl.europa.eu",

He already had money, he already must've had recognition too, and was far too old for any of it to matter.

Lightning Network does not yet support taproot. It's not even in any BOLTs, let alone implemented in actual LN clients. There are years worth of work ahead until this changes.\n2. Public channels have their funding txid announced in the gossip, which is public (and is publicly inspectable, e.g. on 1ML or Amboss). Even with taproot, your public channel funding txid is permanently linked to your LN node and it will be 100% obvious that txo is a Lightning Network channel.\n3. If at any time both channel parties have owned at least 1% of the channel funds, then channel closing will *always* give *both* parties an output. If you close your channel and your channel peer subsequently uses their output from the channel to fund a new public channel, **even private channel funding txes will be identifiable as a LN channel**.\n\n\n\nAlso:\n\n > The Lightning Network does not increase the privacy of payment, it makes payments 100% private. Absolutely and unequivocally private. End of.\n\nAgain completely untrue. Payments are routed across the network as HTLCs, which requires that each LN node along the route sees the same payment hash with an ever-decreasing payment amount (as fees get deducted along the way) and CLTV (lock time). This makes it very easy to trace transactions across the network, and leaks lots of information that can be used to deduce payment source/destination, e.g. `cltv_expiry`s on incoming HTLCs, round payment amounts, timing of payment attempts, and more.\n\nWhen taproot is properly implemented in LN (some years away) it will be possible to upgrade from HTLCs to PTLCs, which do not have the same problem with shared payment hashes. That will significantly improve LN payments privacy, but it does not solve all the problems I described here.\n\n**LN payments privacy is way better than on-chain txes but VERY far from \"absolutely and unequivocally private\"!**\n\n>  What in essence you have done is an ad hoc CoinJoin which severs the relationship between your KYC account and your Bitcoin. (As along as you do not use the same address as you opened the channel with, it goes without saying).\n\nCompletely untrue. Again, both channel peers will get one output from the channel closing tx. Regardless of what address *you* use, when *your peer* subsequently spends their UTXO--e.g. to fund a new channel from their node--it will be 100% clear who owns which UTXO. This is **not** a CoinJoin and does **not** provide the same privacy benefit. Even if it did, a CoinJoin with only one other party gives very little privacy benefit.",

Ethereum started with a 72 million ETH premine, but that doesn't mean people can't make money with it. A lot of people even made money with bitconnect, dogecoin, and shiba inu lol so as long as suckers keep buying it then the price can keep going up. Institutional investors have no interest in ETH and [this report titled \"An Investor's Take on Cryptoassets\" details why](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor's+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf). That report even explains that when the fees get too high and things don't go as planned, users will (and are) switch to a different cryptocurrency. You can already see this happening right now with all of the \"eth killers.\" That report also explains what makes BTC attractive to them.\n\nOver 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as Bitcoin. Satoshi created Bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without the trust or permission of anyone else. Bitcoin had no premine, no developer fund, no developer tax, and no leader. Satoshi never sold, made no profit, got no fame for his real identity, removed himself from the project, and he gave a two month heads up about before he launched Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized and trustless with the full nodes in control of the protocol, and it has no leader or company leading it.\n \nCryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. People use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their Bitcoin stack or even their Ethereum stack if they don't understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Gambling on altcoins can still be very profitable during a bull run, but making a profit is not guaranteed and you can easily lose BTC when gambling on altcoins. \n\nSatoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that Bitcoin was launched fairly:\n\n* No premine (Satoshi didn\u2019t grant himself any coins)\n\n* Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network (no sudden release and no mining before release)\n\n* Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely (it's not even possible for an altcoin to replicate this)\n\n* Satoshi never cashed out (unlike every altcoin founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)\n\nEthereum launched with 12 million ETH for the developers, and 60 million ETH for sale as an \"initial coin offering\" during the presale. They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine and ignoring the 60 million that they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after Ethereum developers and the Ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security, because that's what it is according to the [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp).\n\n[Here is a clip of Joseph Lubin describing how they allowed whales to use multiple fake identities to buy as much ETH as they wanted during the Ethereum presale.](https://i.imgur.com/HpBR7C5.mp4) \"A person can buy with any number of different identities. We may limit the unit size of a single sale to make it easier to disguise. So that nobody scares people with an enormous initial purchase. If you are a whale and you plan on investing several million US dollars worth, then you can do so with with multiple identities.\"\n\nVitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot and he knew better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to investors. Another example is pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETH, now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but \"rich statefulness.\" \n\n[Gregory Maxwell: \u201cVitalik Buterin Ran A Quantum Computer Scam\u201d](http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/08/17/gregory-maxwell-vitalik-buterin-ran-quantum-computer-scam/)\n\n[Quantum Computing and Bitcoin with Vitalik Buterin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkUpZkeqhF4)\n\n[Vitalik\u2019s Quantum Scam](https://medium.com/bitcoinerrorlog/vitaliks-quantum-quest-9e6af6570f23)\n\nThe Ethereum community has endorsed radical changes and pivots, trying to find narrative fit and the Ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit. They've literally tried world computer, dapps, crowdfunding, NFTs, DeFi, open finance, radical markets, store of value, and more. Ethereum is an aggregator of these narratives, trying each one out over the years in an attempt to seduce people that are uneducated about cryptocurrency. But there is no persistence of a singular narrative when it comes to Ethereum and they are still trying to find product market fit even after all this time.\n\nEthereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. What purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems? They also advertised immutability and unstoppable contracts that were then immediately reversed with multiple hard forks. \n\nUnlike Ethereum, Bitcoin's inflation distribution rate and maximum supply are clearly defined and they will never change. The inflation distribution rate and final algo of Ethereum is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and it basically amounts to faith in Vitalik and his team. While at the same time newbies are misled into believing that Ethereum is decentralized. Meanwhile, Vitalik has full control over the whole project. Does anybody else remember the DAO smart contract? Someone found a way to drain ETH and some of Vitalik's buddies lost a ton of ETH, so he rolled back the entire blockchain because Ethereum is centralized, Vitalik is the leader of it, and everyone in the Ethereum community agrees with him and he can do whatever he wants. He chose to change the name of the real Ethereum blockchain to Ethereum classic and calls his rolled back blockchain Ethereum.

Ethereum started with a 72 million ETH premine, but that doesn't mean people can't make money with it. A lot of people even made money with bitconnect, dogecoin, and shiba inu lol so as long as suckers keep buying it then it can keep going up. Institutional investors have no interest in it and [this report](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor's+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf) details why. It even explains that when the fees get too high and things don't go as planned, users will (and are) switch to a different cryptocurrency. You can already see this happening right now with all of the \"eth killers.\"\n\nOver 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as Bitcoin. Satoshi created Bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without the trust or permission of anyone else. Bitcoin had no premine, no developer fund, no developer tax, and no leader. Satoshi never sold, made no profit, got no fame for his real identity, removed himself from the project, and he gave a two month heads up about before he launched Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized and trustless with the full nodes in control of the protocol, and it has no leader or company leading it.\n \nCryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. People use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their Bitcoin stack or even their Ethereum stack if they don't understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Gambling on altcoins can still be very profitable during a bull run, but making a profit is not guaranteed and you can easily lose Bitcoin when gambling on altcoins. \n\nSatoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that Bitcoin was launched fairly:\n\n* No premine (Satoshi didn\u2019t grant himself any coins)\n\n* Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network (no sudden release and no mining before release)\n\n* Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely (it's not even possible for an altcoin to replicate this)\n\n* Satoshi never cashed out (unlike every altcoin founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)\n\nEthereum launched with 12 million ETH for the developers, and 60 million ETH for sale as an \"initial coin offering.\" They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine and ignoring the 60 million that they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after Ethereum developers and the Ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security, because that's what it is according to the [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp).\n\nJust a few days ago the Chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler, even said that several cryptocurrencies are actually non-compliant seucurities. And Ethereum is one the two cryptocurrencies that the SEC is first focusing on. Even though etherians always say that the SEC said it's not a security. But they've really already disregarded that previous claim made by Bill Hinman, former director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance, who suggested that offers and sales of ETH are not securities transactions. Gary Gensler, the current Chair of the SEC, has now said that \"a lot of crypto tokens, I won't call them cryptocurrencies for this moment, are indeed non-compliant securities.\"\n\nVitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot and he knew better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to investors. Another example is pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETH, now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but \"rich statefulness.\" \n\n[Gregory Maxwell: \u201cVitalik Buterin Ran A Quantum Computer Scam\u201d](http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/08/17/gregory-maxwell-vitalik-buterin-ran-quantum-computer-scam/)\n\n[Quantum Computing and Bitcoin with Vitalik Buterin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkUpZkeqhF4)\n\n[Vitalik\u2019s Quantum Scam](https://medium.com/bitcoinerrorlog/vitaliks-quantum-quest-9e6af6570f23)\n\nThe Ethereum community has endorsed radical changes and pivots, trying to find narrative fit and the Ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit. They've literally tried world computer, dapps, crowdfunding, NFTs, DeFi, open finance, radical markets, store of value, and more. Ethereum is an aggregator of these narratives, trying each one out over the years in an attempt to seduce people that are uneducated about cryptocurrency. But there is no persistence of a singular narrative when it comes to Ethereum and they are still trying to find product market fit even after all this time.\n\nEthereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. What purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems? They also advertised immutability and unstoppable contracts that were then immediately reversed with multiple hard forks. \n\nUnlike Ethereum, Bitcoin's inflation distribution rate and maximum supply are clearly defined and they will never change. The inflation distribution rate and final algo of Ethereum is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and it basically amounts to faith in Vitalik and his team. While at the same time newbies are misled into believing that Ethereum is decentralized. Meanwhile, Vitalik has full control over the whole project. Do you even remember the DAO contract? Someone found a way to drain ETH and some of Vitalik's buddies lost a ton of ETH, so he rolled back the entire blockchain because Ethereum is centralized, Vitalik is the leader of it and everyone in the Ethereum community agrees with him and he can do whatever he wants. He chose to change the name of the real Ethereum blockchain to Ethereum classic and calls his rolled back blockchain Ethereum. Not long ago ETH miners said they weren't going to follow Vitalik into adding a ponzi style transaction fee burn, so Vitalik, leader of Ethereum, called their consensus a 51% attack and changed the rules. Vitalik can only control Ethereum because it's centralized.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has switched over to staking rewards also has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your ETH being staked will expose users to legal tax obligations. Exchanges for example must send a 1099-MISC to the IRS on behalf of any American user earning $600 in a year. Proof-of-Stake also makes it so the already rich whales control the network and will be collecting compounding interest to dump on the open market.\n\nEthereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch and I have no expectation that the new Ethereum will be any more successful than the current one. This can only be done because Ethereum is centralized. Ethereum 2 will still be a centralized scamcoin controlled and ran by scammers.  \n\n[Vitalik is already laying the groundwork for some more hype and suggesting a re-brand to Ethereum 3.0!](https://i.imgur.com/mxIzBYK.mp4)\n\nEthereum scam part 1 - [Here we focus on the Ethereum token pre-sale which to anyone with any financial experience, is an obvious sale of an unlicensed unregistered security.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUVlatCvp0)\n\nEthereum scam part 2 - [Here we take a look at the value & business proposition of Decentralized Smart Contracts and why it's one of the dumbest ways to make your business more efficient.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCiHTJRbIf4)\n\nEthereum scam part 3 - [The Ethereum scam part 3.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgFXqVpGDNg)\n\nhttps://medium.com/startup-grind/i-was-wrong-about-ethereum-804c9a906d36\n\n[Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are Scams and so are the developers that build on them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtVLjCxPDU)",

It even explains that when the fees get too high and things don't go as planned, users will (and are) switch to a different cryptocurrency. You can already see this happening right now with all of the \"eth killers.\"\n\nOver 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as Bitcoin. Satoshi created Bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without the trust or permission of anyone else. Bitcoin had no premine, no developer fund, no developer tax, and no leader. Satoshi never sold, made no profit, got no fame for his real identity, removed himself from the project, and he gave a two month heads up about before he launched Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized and trustless with the full nodes in control of the protocol, and it has no leader or company leading it.\n \nCryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. People use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their Bitcoin stack or even their Ethereum stack if they don't understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Gambling on altcoins can still be very profitable during a bull run, but making a profit is not guaranteed and you can easily lose Bitcoin when gambling on altcoins. \n\nSatoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that Bitcoin was launched fairly:\n\n* No premine (Satoshi didn\u2019t grant himself any coins)\n\n* Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network (no sudden release and no mining before release)\n\n* Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely (it's not even possible for an altcoin to replicate this)\n\n* Satoshi never cashed out (unlike every altcoin founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)\n\nEthereum launched with 12 million ETH for the developers, and 60 million ETH for sale as an \"initial coin offering.\" They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine and ignoring the 60 million that they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after Ethereum developers and the Ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security, because that's what it is according to the [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp).\n\nJust a few days ago the Chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler, even said that several cryptocurrencies are actually non-compliant seucurities. And Ethereum is one the two cryptocurrencies that the SEC is first focusing on. Even though etherians always say that the SEC said it's not a security. But they've really already disregarded that previous claim made by Bill Hinman, former director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance, who suggested that offers and sales of ETH are not securities transactions. Gary Gensler, the current Chair of the SEC, has now said that \"a lot of crypto tokens, I won't call them cryptocurrencies for this moment, are indeed non-compliant securities.\"\n\nVitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot and he knew better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to investors. Another example is pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETH, now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but \"rich statefulness.\" \n\n[Gregory Maxwell: \u201cVitalik Buterin Ran A Quantum Computer Scam\u201d](http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/08/17/gregory-maxwell-vitalik-buterin-ran-quantum-computer-scam/)\n\n[Quantum Computing and Bitcoin with Vitalik Buterin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkUpZkeqhF4)\n\n[Vitalik\u2019s Quantum Scam](https://medium.com/bitcoinerrorlog/vitaliks-quantum-quest-9e6af6570f23)\n\nThe Ethereum community has endorsed radical changes and pivots, trying to find narrative fit and the Ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit. They've literally tried world computer, dapps, crowdfunding, NFTs, DeFi, open finance, radical markets, store of value, and more. Ethereum is an aggregator of these narratives, trying each one out over the years in an attempt to seduce people that are uneducated about cryptocurrency. But there is no persistence of a singular narrative when it comes to Ethereum and they are still trying to find product market fit even after all this time.\n\nEthereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. What purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems? They also advertised immutability and unstoppable contracts that were then immediately reversed with multiple hard forks. \n\nUnlike Ethereum, Bitcoin's inflation distribution rate and maximum supply are clearly defined and they will never change. The inflation distribution rate and final algo of Ethereum is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and it basically amounts to faith in Vitalik and his team. While at the same time newbies are misled into believing that Ethereum is decentralized. Meanwhile, Vitalik has full control over the whole project. Do you even remember the DAO contract? Someone found a way to drain ETH and some of Vitalik's buddies lost a ton of ETH, so he rolled back the entire blockchain because Ethereum is centralized, Vitalik is the leader of it and everyone in the Ethereum community agrees with him and he can do whatever he wants. He chose to change the name of the real Ethereum blockchain to Ethereum classic and calls his rolled back blockchain Ethereum. Not long ago ETH miners said they weren't going to follow Vitalik into adding a ponzi style transaction fee burn, so Vitalik, leader of Ethereum, called their consensus a 51% attack and changed the rules. Vitalik can only control Ethereum because it's centralized.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum has switched over to staking rewards also has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your ETH being staked will expose users to legal tax obligations. Exchanges for example must send a 1099-MISC to the IRS on behalf of any American user earning $600 in a year. Proof-of-Stake also makes it so the already rich whales control the network and will be collecting compounding interest to dump on the open market.\n\nEthereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch and I have no expectation that the new Ethereum will be any more successful than the current one. This can only be done because Ethereum is centralized. Ethereum 2 will still be a centralized scamcoin controlled and ran by scammers.  \n\n[Vitalik is already laying the groundwork for some more hype and suggesting a re-brand to Ethereum 3.0!](https://i.imgur.com/mxIzBYK.mp4)\n\nEthereum scam part 1 - [Here we focus on the Ethereum token pre-sale which to anyone with any financial experience, is an obvious sale of an unlicensed unregistered security.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUVlatCvp0)\n\nEthereum scam part 2 - [Here we take a look at the value & business proposition of Decentralized Smart Contracts and why it's one of the dumbest ways to make your business more efficient.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCiHTJRbIf4)\n\nEthereum scam part 3 - [The Ethereum scam part 3.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgFXqVpGDNg)\n\nhttps://medium.com/startup-grind/i-was-wrong-about-ethereum-804c9a906d36\n\n[Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are Scams and so are the developers that build on them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtVLjCxPDU)",

This is important because Bitcoin only acrues monetary premium from being extremely difficult to destroy and create (much like gold).\n\nBitcoin is, by far, the protocol for which it is easiest to spin up a full node. It needs nothing other than a Raspberry Pi 4 or an old laptop with a modest internet connection. All other protocols require nodes with higher bandwidth and processing power to achieve their stated aims (unless they are new or ghost chains that see little use).\n\nI should also mention that some projects twist the meaning of what a full node is to downplay this fact.\n\nIf you like, Bitcoin's strategy is to use the base chain to secure the most important monetary properties (such as scarcity) and not much else. Extra features like instant payments are offloaded from the main chain and onto second layers (such as Lightning).",

There is no such thing as \"intrinsic value\".  This assumption has been a plague on economic theory since Marx.  Value is aligned with demonstrated preference.  Human preference is demonstrated through how they act.  For example, people have demonstrated a preference for bitcoin over other uses of capital such as going to a movie.  The other uses to which the capital could have been put are the opportunity costs.  Value is a personal hierarchy of wants.  By demonstrating preference for bitcoin over the dollar (you purchased the bitcoin right?... and not something else) you value bitcoin higher than the dollar.  You \"value\" the bitcoin higher than the dollar.  \n\nThe reason bitcoin is succeeding is because individuals prefer bitcoin against the dollar.  This trend is growing and that is the primary reason bitcoin will replace the dollar.  It just works better to satisfy ends than the dollar does.",

                    "response": "> unlocking the potential for smart contracts to run on Bitcoin\n\nThis has always been possible.\nTaproot makes it cheaper to do this (and more private) since less data will be required to achieve the same contracts we used to have.\n\nThere is a lot more in this front on the way. See the way off-chain smart contracts work is we create transactions for a shared address (multi-sig) to a script address that puts conditions on the final settlement to ensure that there is time (a timelock) to react if there is any fraud identified between parties of the contract. We call this update transactions and the final withdrawal of funds is called a settlement transaction.\n\nUntil now, it has been inconvenient to make an update transaction on top of another on top of another, because if I broadcast an old update transaction, then the script transaction will have a clause that says: \"the next update transaction will take precidence over any settlement transaction\". The problem is that if there are 10 more update transactions, you need to broadcast all of them in order, each costing a miner fee.\n\nThe current Lightning protocol got around this by just implementing \"penalty transactions\" that basically just said: If you have proof that the update tx broadcast isn't the latest, then just let the victim withdraw everything. It's a big hammer solution.\n\n\nEdit: changed the word Taproot to Eltoo here because I was mistaken:\nEltoo (an upgrade that I expect will be coming to bitcoin in the next few years) will enable us to change the update transactions, changing \"I will give precidence to the next update transaction\" into \"I will give precidence to any update transaction newer than this\". That means we only need to broadcast the last update transaction to fix the situation, we don't need to publish every update transaction between the old and the new.\n\nWhen we don't have penalties, we can start to do contracts between more than just 2 people (penalties don't work if only one person can claim the rewards in a group of 2 victims out of 3 parties).\n\nMy point is that these updates coming will make smart contracts smarter and cheaper, but we could always TECHNICALLY do them; it just wasn't very economical to do it until now. Hope this makes you bullish, it makes me super bullish.",

At the burning of Rome (64 AD), Rome needed quick money to rebuild so they began the debasement of their own silver coins by reducing the silver content of the coins. This practice didn't stop, of course, because it was so easy to get this \"extra\" money so they continued the practice for about 300 years, until the coin was essentially worthless.\n\nSound familiar? It should. Like they say: the only thing we learn from history is that we don't learn from history.\n\nThey had other problems too but debasing their own currency is tied to pretty much every other problem they had, including not funding good defenses from invaders.\n\n[https://coinweek.com/dealers-companies/ngc-dealers-companies/ngc-ancients-the-decline-of-roman-imperial-silver-coinage-part-i/](https://coinweek.com/dealers-companies/ngc-dealers-companies/ngc-ancients-the-decline-of-roman-imperial-silver-coinage-part-i/)",

NFTs have some actual uses, but what people doing with them right now isn't one of them. The current NFTs probably wont even exist in 10 years. \n\nMany of those NFTs that were sold for crazy high prices were not actually sold to other people. The person buying those expensive NFTs is often the same person who minted the NFT in the first place. I will explain how whales can easily own very expensive rare NFTs for very little cost. They can just mint an NFT and sell it to them self for $500,000 worth of et\u04bb. They will only lose the small percentage that the NFT marketplace takes and now they own a super rare NFT worth $500k and they will still have most of their et\u04bb because they sold the NFT to them self. And there is also a small chance that they might be able to to sell that worthless NFT to some fool who actually believes that it is valuable. Doing this entices more newbies to mint NFTs in the hopes of getting rich.\n\nHere is another example that can be done. You can mint an NFT and sell it to yourself for $1000, then put it up for sale and buy it from yourself again for $1500, and sell it to yourself another time for $2200. Now you can put this appreciating NFT up for sale and try to sell it to someone else. It keeps getting sold for more. It must be valuable!\n\nThe current NFTs are useful for something. These NFTs are a useful tool for laundering illegally acquired cryptocurrency. Criminals can shift around their ill gotten crypto between different tokens, mint an NFT, and purchase their own NFT with their dirty crypto. Now they've cleaned their dirty crypto and they also own a rare NFT that's supposedly worth a lot of money. I mean just look at how much it sold for!\n\n[It costs anywhere from $70-$500+ to mint an NFT on et\u04bbereum](https://www.supercryptonews.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-mint-an-nft/) depending on where you do it, so they're [hyping shitcoiners/artists/anyone up and luring them into minting crap in the hopes of getting rich](https://fstoppers.com/opinion/nfts-are-pyramid-scheme-and-people-are-already-losing-money-554869) and NFTs are doing a great job of that at the moment. People are blowing millions of dollars worth of et\u04bbereum minting NFTs hoping to hit the NFT lottery and get rich.\n\n**All these NFT tokens being sold on et\u04bbereum right now either point to a URL on the internet, or an IPFS hash. In most circumstances they reference an IPFS gateway on the internet run by the same startup that sold the NFT. That URL also isn't the media. That URL is a JSON metadata file.** The owners of the servers have no obligation to continue storing the media. Now let's take a look at a couple of real NFTs and see how they work on a technical level.\n\nhttps://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/1\n\nThis NFT token is for this JSON file hosted directly on Nifty's servers as shown below: https://api.niftygateway.com/beeple/100010001/\n\nThat file refers to the actual media that was \"bought.\" Which in this case is hosted by Cloudinary CDN, which is served by Nifty's servers again. So if Nifty goes bust, this token is now worthless. It refers to nothing and this can't be changed. \n\nNow we'll take a look at the $69,346,250 Beeple, sold by Christies. It's so expensive. Surely it isn't centralized, right? Wrong, it's pointless: https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924\n\nThat NFT token refers directly to an IPFS hash. We can take that IPFS hash and fetch the JSON metadata using a public gateway: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz\n\nSo well done for referring to IPFS, it references the specific file rather than a URL that might break! **But** the metadata links to: https://ipfsgateway.makersplace.com/ipfs/QmXkxpwAHCtDXbbZHUwqtFucG1RMS6T87vi1CdvadfL7qA\n\nThis is an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com, the same NFT minting startup which will go bust one day.\n\nYou might say \"*just refer to the IPFS hash in both places!*\" But IPFS only serves files as long as a node in the IPFS network **intentionally** keeps hosting it. Which means when the startup who sold you the NFT goes bust, the files will probably vanish from IPFS too. [This is already happening.](https://twitter.com/CheckMyNFT/status/1371960028765245440) There are already [NFTs with IPFS resources that are no longer hosted anywhere.](https://twitter.com/scanlime/status/1371509988179464196)\n\nAnd just pinning the file on your own IPFS node also wont work because the metadata file generally points to a specific HTTP IPFS gateway URL and not the IPFS hash. This means that when the gateway operator goes bust, I can buy the domain and start serving dick pics lol\n\nRight now NFT's are built on an absolute house of cards constructed by the people selling them, and it is likely that every NFT sold on et\u04bbereum so far will be broken within a decade. This creates a pretty solid exit plan for makersplace if they run into financial problems. The people who own the these useless NFTs \"worth\" millions of dollars are going to be pretty motivated to buy the site or fund it. Or someone can buy the bankrupt startup domains and start charging NFT owners to serve their files.",

There is no art contained within, unless you consider the receipt for a picasso to be \"art\", or even very valuable without the non-duplicatable physical object to match.    \n\nBitcoin is to value and economic energy storage, as artwork is to work+talent+time storage.  Artwork is valuable because it captures, in an object, and not by fiat declaration, but actual proven tangible and extant work and talent--it captures value. An nft is a fiat declaration of value. Nothing more.   \n\nIt's fitting that those who fall for proof-of-stake coins which are also mere fiat, too fall for the emptiness and pretending of nfts.  These people are literally just following, like disciplines and children, the orders and declarations, of Richard Nixon when he announced the insolvency of the US Dollar, and wrote into existence the fantasy and myth, a sort of white paper if you will, of modern fiat currency to cover up his lies, tyranny, and greed for power. NFTs and proof-of-stake are examples of Nixon's Model of Deceit and Denial to keep afloat their own monetary regime for just long enough to profit from those more ignorant and easier persuaded by sophistry and tautology than himself.",

But even if lets say the world moves to a Bitcoin standard, it still could run the current financial system in the same old, centralized way. To give people full access to capital markets and enable a fair system that is not controlled by market makers and centralized parties, you need DeFi. You need the permissionless access to stuff and you need true ownership of assets or at least the possibility for it. That is something Bitcoin simply cant do in its current state, peroid.\n\nThis is not a bad thing. The question just is do we need Bitcoin for everything. I dont think it is wise to completely rely on one blockchain, one \"thing\" because this kind of centralizes risk.

If prices get down to 33k without a major black swan I think that\u2019s the time to go all in. \n\nSo many noobs say, \u201coh if it gets to 30k, I would buy\u201d no they won\u2019t. You gotta realize the sentiment and fear would be horrific at that point. Everyone would be expecting it to get to zero. I am starting to realize that Reddit today isn\u2019t what it was ten years ago. A lot of these weird emotional posts that scream inexperience have to be made by teenagers. It\u2019s kind of a wasteland at the moment. People are too narcissistic and brainwashed to be challenged by anyone, so people downvote anything that makEs them uncomfortable.\n\nThis sideways action is just consolidation in a range. Nothing to get sad or excited about. The longer it goes on the more explosive the decision will be. \nIf I had to guess we will get rallies through the 45-47k and to around 52k area max mid year before the end of the year, then a recession of some sort with a heavy correction. \n\nThis is pretty much what the data says. But it\u2019s bitcoin and you never know. Besides obviously that it\u2019s the most rare solid money in the world and someday the price is going to stun a lot of people. Kinda bearish short- mid term. Bullish long term.",

Now we are so far in debt, we won't be able to service the debt once interest rates rise, and interest rates are bound to rise with the higher inflation we are now facing, and (2) Back in the 70's when we had nominal inflation around 12%, you could earn 7% interest on cash you held in bank savings/MM accounts, so really you were only losing about 5% of purchasing power annually to inflation.  Today we have true inflation > 10% (officially 8.5%) but you earn 0.002% interest on your cash accounts.  So the situation today is actually worse for your average household.",

Eg. once upon a time you could afford to goto a concert 5times a year, but now the ticket prices have gone up so much, you can no longer afford the concerts tickets anymore and you can only afford to watch concerts live on youtube. The CPI says cost of entertainment has gone down because it\u2019s now cheaper to stream. That\u2019s how they blind the consumers with these bullshit data. 8% my ass!",

But now you can get nearly endless streaming entertainment for like $15/month. Or AAA video games are basically the same price they\u2019ve been for years, but now they\u2019re crammed with micro transactions. Hard to figure out the right way to measure that stuff.\n\nEither way, we\u2019re not at 600%+ inflation. At that level, you need your salary to double every couple months or you literally wouldn\u2019t be able to afford anything.",

I had ideas about creating my own coin, to solve the 'proof of work is inefficient' \"problem\" with bitcoin.\n\nI have P and NP tattooed on m wrists. These are famous computational complexity classes, the subject of an open question in theoretical computer science (does P = NP?) and, i think, one of the most interesting questions people have ever asked.   I was obsessed with this question for a long time, hence the tattoos.\n\nI had really been excited about the possibility of building a coin that might 'solve' the problem using a clever workaround: build a database of solutions to NP complete problems.   It seemed so poetic, i was in love with the idea. I _had_ to do it. But of course i didn't want to rip off a bunch of people who were investing in what might not work. So i had to first confirm to my satisfaction that i could actually deliver this thing.\n\nSo i started looking into bitcoin even more, to better understand exactly how it works. How does block difficulty adjustment work? How are the nodes agreeing on how much to adjust the difficulty? What exactly prevents different attacks on the longest chain from succeeding?  _why_ does proof of work actually work?\n\nAnd eventually it became clear that even though i previously _thought_ i understood bitcoin, i really hadn't.  I hadn't gotten just how tightly it all fits together, and how removing any one piece of the design - like the requirement that you can't start work on block n+1 until you have full knowledge of block n - makes the whole thing fall apart.\n\nAt that point i went full maxi.",

But it would still be a centralized scam even if it was created without the massive 72 million ETH premine. \n\nEthereum started with a 72 million ETH premine, but that doesn't mean people can't make money with it. A lot of people even made money with bitconnect, dogecoin, and shiba inu... So as long as suckers keep buying ETH then its price can keep going up. But institutional investors have no interest in ETH and [this report titled \"An Investor's Take on Cryptoassets\" details why](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor's+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf). That report even explains that when the fees get too high and things don't go as planned, users will (and are) switch to a different cryptocurrency. You can already see this happening right now with all of the \"ETH killers.\" That report also explains what makes BTC attractive to them.\n\n[Click here and listen to a few minutes of Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song talk about Ethereum and Vitalik.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&t=47m24s) \n\nJimmy worked directly with Vitalik from the beginning, back when Vitalik was still working on rootstock for Bitcoin.\n\nOver 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as Bitcoin. Satoshi created Bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without the trust or permission of anyone else. Bitcoin had no premine, no developer fund, no developer tax, and no leader. Satoshi never sold, made no profit, got no fame for his real identity, removed himself from the project, and he gave a two month heads up about before he launched Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized and trustless with the full nodes in control of the protocol, and it has no leader or company leading it.\n \nCryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. People use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their Bitcoin stack or even their Ethereum stack if they don't understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Gambling on altcoins can still be very profitable during a bull run, but making a profit is not guaranteed and you can easily lose BTC when gambling on altcoins. \n\nSatoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that Bitcoin was launched fairly:\n\n* No premine (Satoshi didn\u2019t grant himself any coins)\n\n* Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network (no sudden release and no mining before release)\n\n* Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely (it's not even possible for an altcoin to replicate this)\n\n* Satoshi never cashed out (unlike every altcoin founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)\n\nEthereum launched with 12 million ETH for the developers, and 60 million ETH for sale as an \"initial coin offering\" during the presale. They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine and ignoring the 60 million that they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after Ethereum developers and the Ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security, because that's what it is according to the [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp).\n\n[Here is a clip of Joseph Lubin describing how they allowed whales to use multiple fake identities to buy as much ETH as they wanted during the Ethereum presale.](https://i.imgur.com/HpBR7C5.mp4) \"A person can buy with any number of different identities. We may limit the unit size of a single sale to make it easier to disguise. So that nobody scares people with an enormous initial purchase. If you are a whale and you plan on investing several million US dollars worth, then you can do so with with multiple identities.\"\n\nVitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot and he knew better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to investors. Another example is pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETH, now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but \"rich statefulness.\" \n\n[Gregory Maxwell: \u201cVitalik Buterin Ran A Quantum Computer Scam\u201d](http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/08/17/gregory-maxwell-vitalik-buterin-ran-quantum-computer-scam/)\n\n[Quantum Computing and Bitcoin with Vitalik Buterin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkUpZkeqhF4)\n\n[Vitalik\u2019s Quantum Scam](https://medium.com/bitcoinerrorlog/vitaliks-quantum-quest-9e6af6570f23)\n\nThe Ethereum community has endorsed radical changes and pivots, trying to find narrative fit and the Ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit. They've literally tried world computer, dapps, crowdfunding, NFTs, DeFi, open finance, radical markets, store of value, and more. Ethereum is an aggregator of these narratives, trying each one out over the years in an attempt to seduce people that are uneducated about cryptocurrency. But there is no persistence of a singular narrative when it comes to Ethereum and they are still trying to find product market fit even after all this time.\n\nEthereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. What purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems? They also advertised immutability and unstoppable contracts that were then immediately reversed with multiple hard forks. \n\nUnlike Ethereum, Bitcoin's inflation rate and maximum supply are clearly defined and they will never change. Ethereum's inflation rate, maximum supply, and final algo are not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and it basically amounts to faith in Vitalik and his team. While at the same time newbies are misled into believing that Ethereum is decentralized. Meanwhile, Vitalik has full control over the whole project. Does anybody else here remember the DAO smart contract? Someone found a way to drain ETH and some of Vitalik's buddies lost a ton of ETH, so he rolled back the entire blockchain because Ethereum is centralized, Vitalik is the leader of it, and everyone in the Ethereum community agrees with him, so he can do whatever he wants with Ethereum. He chose to change the name of the real Ethereum blockchain to Ethereum Classic and calls his rolled back blockchain Ethereum. Not long ago ETH miners said they weren't going to follow Vitalik into adding a ponzi style transaction fee burn, so Vitalik, leader of Ethereum, called their consensus a 51% attack and changed the rules. \n\nThe fact that Ethereum has switched over to staking rewards also has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your ETH being staked will expose users to legal tax obligations. Exchanges for example must send a 1099-MISC to the IRS on behalf of any American user earning $600 in a year. Proof-of-Stake also makes it so the already rich whales control the network and will be collecting compounding interest to dump on the open market.\n\nEthereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch and I have no expectation that the new Ethereum will be any more successful than the current one. This can only be done because Ethereum is centralized. Ethereum 2 will still be a centralized scamcoin controlled and ran by scammers.  \n\n[Vitalik is already laying the groundwork for some more hype and suggesting a re-brand to Ethereum 3.0!](https://i.imgur.com/mxIzBYK.mp4)\n\nEthereum scam part 1 - [Here we focus on the Ethereum token pre-sale which to anyone with any financial experience, is an obvious sale of an unlicensed unregistered security.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUVlatCvp0)\n\nEthereum scam part 2 - [Here we take a look at the value & business proposition of Decentralized Smart Contracts and why it's one of the dumbest ways to make your business more efficient.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCiHTJRbIf4)\n\nEthereum scam part 3 - [The Ethereum scam part 3.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgFXqVpGDNg)\n\nhttps://medium.com/startup-grind/i-was-wrong-about-ethereum-804c9a906d36\n\n[Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are Scams and so are the developers that build on them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtVLjCxPDU)\n\n\"The Ethereum blockchain growing 85 terabytes per year is totally fine.

They fired their founder because he had some mainstream political views.\n\nMozilla is in a death spiral, as they say \"go woke, go broke\".",

Shopify will partner with anyone, eComm merchants have over 100 payment types available to them. Blackhawk processes very few payments so puzzling what role they play. Their primary role is in distributing gift cards. NCR is well established in retail, convenience, grocery but they'll have little influence over the brands (McDonalds, WalMart etc) to convince them to accept Strike payments - the back-office implications (settlement, reporting, disputes / refunds etc) are significant.

It's absolutely genius. I understand that the \"digital gold\" people are upset it wasn't yet another corporation who hodls Bitcoin on their balance sheet, but holy fuck are those people blind to how much bigger this is.\n\nEven I first underestimated the possible effect until someone who is actually affected by this as a merchant pointed out that the fee is 3% off the full price, but since the margin is probably always lower, it will be significantly more money the merchant gets by this. As an example, if the margin is 10%, then that means 30% more gains. This is so much, that they will go out of their way to make sure the customer uses LN and not credit cards anymore.\n\nThis has a decent chance to establish LN as the default payment network, and with it Bitcoin as the reserve currency because it's the native bearer asset.

It's like a pre-paid card I charge with Bitcoin, it's a separate account. Because why would I not use an open source payment system that is completely under my control and is much cheaper and faster, than a proprietary credit card.\n\nAs a side effect, it so happens that I initially put $300 dollars worth of Bitcoin on that LN wallet. I occasionally used it, even paid for a trip to a Bitcoin event including the ticket, and countless beer. Now I have only $800 in Sats left. Imagine I had put that $300 on a debit card or on pay pal or some shit.\n\nIf I could pay everything with LN I would have literally all my money in Bitcoin and only a small emergency sum in fiat for as long as it's still so volatile.",

Therefore it is very unlikely that will change with digital payments\n3. Only a relatively small number of btc will be taken out of the market by strike since they will be used for the settlement only which can be done million of times with the same btc. Therefore price appreciation of btc because of strike is relatively unlikely.\n4. ~~It is not a display of how great LN is but is displaying of how archaic and ineffectiv the credit card systems are. A cheaper payment could have also be done by any other (centralized) systems like paypal is using for example.~~\n\nEdit: Delete #4.

Surely someone who can understand the latter has 0 confusion over the former?\n\nIs your audience general, or do they have a background in cryptography already?\n\nIf the former, perhaps strike out #5, #7, #8, #9, #10 - that's just not needed.  And #6 isn't so much a misconception as it is a diverse topic, because you are already not focusing on Bitcoin alone based on your course title, I presume.  Once you count other cryptos, you will find that actually ASIC mining is the outlier, not the standard.\n\nAbout the BTC focus - I think #3 is wrong for some non-UTXO cryptos.  And the way you have written it, your clause \"**since** wallets do not store your coins\" makes it sound like the reason a transaction doesn't send/receive coins is precisely because of the wallet's structure.  Well that isn't true.  It is because of the UTXO nature of Bitcoin and other currencies that a transaction changes ownership of existing UTXOs rather than \"sending\" them somewhere.  The wallets for *all* cryptocurrencies don't store coins, because a wallet is as you point out elsewhere a keypair with some sugar, hook to the blockchain, and UI poured on top of it.  The tokens are on the blockchain just like my $ is in the bank's database despite me having my bank's app on my phone to see it and interact with it (god willing).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt almost seems like your list isn't really \"misconceptions\" but \"miscellany\".  Even the 21m BTC item is on your list as a trivia point relative to ETH rather than a myth clarification (the myth being, \"Anybody can just change the software and make more BTC\" or \"How do I *know* there's only going to be 21m?  Who decides?\")\n\nIf that's the case, consider separating it into categories of miscellany like \"Cryptography in Bitcoin\", \"Economic factors behind mining\", \"NFTs and who the fuck cares really ;)\", and \"Token growth schedules, burning, and the merits therein\".\n\nIf going for true myths, check out the Bitcoin wiki for examples to get the juices flowing.",

Good money is scarce. The biggest weakness of cryptocurrencies is that they can be created easily from nothing. All alts are like this. But Bitcoin is different. It has miraculously been born and has gained a huge lead in network effects. This can not be copied. Thus, it has gained scarcity. It is extremely decentralised, and has by far the greatest hashing power on the planet, and distribution of full nodes, which makes it not possible to tamper with the monetary policy. Bitcoin has scarcity due to network effect lead and \u201cun-tamper-ability\u201d.\n\nThe Lindy effect will only make it stronger as day after day it doesn\u2019t die. It can\u2019t be eradicated, just like a cancer that has spread too far.\n\nThe copies cannot compete with this. It needs the majority to not only leave Bitcoin, but mostly leave to the same choice. There are thousands of choices, so those few people that abandon Bitcoin will not all go to the same choice. In other words, defectors will disperse, not concentrate. The only way this could theoretically happen is if there is some fatal flaw with Bitcoin, AND it can\u2019t be fixed, AND an altcoin can, AND only one altcoin can.\n\nE.g. let\u2019s say Bitcoin\u2019s privacy weakness (really it\u2019s a trade off, not a weakness and any other coin with privacy just chooses a different trade off) is suddenly critical and everyone is exiting. Where will they go? Monero, Zcash, DASH, some to ETH and XRP (not private btw), Cardano\u2026. Can they all be money? Money printer go brrrr much?\n\nSo how else can an Altcoin take over? Remember that people will save in the best money. An Altcoin must become fundamentally better. In the open source world, how is that possible? It\u2019s like thinking it\u2019s possible for a better operating system to exist than the dominant open source one today (GNU Linux). The open source leader just gets better and better. All new ideas get absorbed.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine another currency finds a good use case. Let\u2019s say smart contracts. First that\u2019s like saying paper is money and valuable because contracts can be written on it. No, you need to make good money first, not find other uses for it. Aluminium has more uses than gold but it\u2019s less valuable because it is not money. It can\u2019t be money because it is not scarce. But even if smart contracts makes a cryptocurrency into good money, there are too many: ETH, Cardano, TRON, Iota, probably others.\n\nAs soon as any becomes valuable, it will invite competition and it will be copied. There is no scarcity. For goodness sake, ETH doesn\u2019t even work yet. Its Turing completeness is not even used. Bitcoin has smart contract capability and I understand nearly everything ETH is doing program-wise can be done with Bitcoin. Let\u2019s face it, it is competing with Bitcoin as a money and is far far behind and has no credibility. What will Vitalik Buterin do with the monetary policy next?\n\nETH is just another fiat with a central banker. That is not a true cryptocurrency. Remember why Bitcoin was born \u2013 we are fighting central banking and trying to separate money and state, not shoot ourselves in the foot by losing focus, trying to get rich by improving on the solution we already miraculously discovered. Bitcoin is that: a miracle \u2013 and we should embrace it.\n\nAlso, you mention ROI. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist so you can buy it and sell it for more fiat later. It is a REPLACEMENT for fiat. You buy and NEVER sell. You spend once it achieves its true value. You don\u2019t need an exit strategy. You just save in Bitcoin. With alts, you need to time your exit and sell to a greater fool, because alts are scams, holding forever will get you rekt. Just DCA Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s like picking up gold off the ground before anyone else realises it will become money. Don\u2019t pick up pebbles or seashells (alts), your pockets have limited space. Finally, the most important problem to solve is separating money and state. All other problems are tiny in comparison. We don\u2019t need to replace the legal system with smart contracts. We don\u2019t need a token for everything. We don\u2019t need to put bananas on a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is an invention that solves a humanitarian problem. Altcoins take a solution (blockchain) and try to find a problem. Remember that.",

Proof of Stake coins usually require a large amount of coins to operate a node. This leads to fewer nodes and more centralization.\n\n3 - The majority of the other coins have a \"head figure\" lile a CEO. When governments go after a blockchain they can they the head figure with prison time unless they make a compromise. They could actually imprison the head figure. Either way ot would cause problems for the blockchain.\n\n4 - Bitcoin actually has a purpose store of value/money. You wouldn't invest 100k in Chuck E Cheese token because you like the company. Many people are doing that with alt coins. They are buying coins that serve no function. What is the purpose of a Doge coin?  Polkadot? Solana? \n\n5 - BTC has no smart contracts. Since anyone can write a smart contract, many scammers have spent time writing malicious smart contracts designed to steal crypto. This will eventually lead to those blockchains being targeted by the government due to rampant fraud.\n\n6 - Bitcoin has a hard cap and the BTC printer can't be turned on after 21 mil. Other sh!t coins have a supply limit regulated by just a few people. (Ethereum).\n\n7 - anyone who operates a Bitcoin node gets a vote. This doesn't happen in other alt coins.\n\n8 - small block size ensures the hardware requirements will not exceed technology in the next future. Some blockchains like ETH already require a hard drive double the capacity of BTC and have only been around for half as long as Bitcoin. This will eventually lead to the number of nodes decreasing overtime as the cost of hardware to operate a node increases. It could also be possible that the blockchain outpaces the size limitation of available hardware in the future.\n\n9 - Proof of stake leads to the rich getting richer as the crypto slowly filters up. BTC is proof of work and doesn't have this issue.\n\n10 - Bitcoin has survived multiple forks and the test of time.",

It works but the setup fees are quite high (and it requires a lot of work and diligence), and there is also a small annual fee for the custodian and the LLC registration. So it only pays off for $100k and more I would say.\n\nBelow that threshold it's more cost effective to open a regular IRA with a custodian and buy GBTC or OBTC. OBTC has low liquidity but only 0.5% annual fees. Just make sure to buy with a limit order.\n\nI know there are also \"Bitcoin IRAs\" that buy Bitcoin on your behalf, but the premiums and fees made this inferior to the two options above the last time I checked.\n\nIf you are a hardcore \"Not your coins not your crypto\" person, there is only one option of course: self-directed IRA.",

All other coins are waste of time if they are not backed by bitcoin, or do not serve some very specific short-term purpose, like a gaming event.",

Computers become exponentially more powerful allowing for new kinds of software that weren't possible even a decade earlier. We're building things our grandparents couldn't have dreamed of building. This is all true.\n\nAnd yet... Bitcoin is forever. Trustless decentralized digital assets peaked in 2008. Cryptocurrency is immune to the Exponential Age, I guess? We won't use all of that magical science fiction hardware that's coming down the pipe to build a new thing we \"never could have dreamed of\" in the cryptocurrency space?\n\nI'm pro-Bitcoin (and my money is very much where my mouth is). But I'm also fully aware that Bitcoin is just the \"lightbulb\" in comparison to future innovations that we don't even see coming. In the next two decades there's no reason to think we couldn't see new innovations that absolutely disrupt and redefine the crypto space and leave Bitcoin in the dust. If you think this isn't a concern then you don't actually believe in your Exponential Age and its implications.\n\nThis is why I laugh whenever I see threads about what happens after the last Bitcoin gets mined. The idea that Bitcoin will be important over a century from now is delusional. Predictions about Bitcoin's importance twenty years from now can't hope to be accurate. Predictions about its importance ten years from now might be close to accurate, but that's pushing it. I say all this because I actually believe that we are in the Exponential Age. Bitcoin isn't exempt from being steamrolled out of nowhere by runaway progress.\n\nPosts like this one are part of why Bitcoin isn't taken as seriously as it should be (though this post is still better than most of what gets upvoted in the crypto subs). Bitcoin needs sober analysis that takes all the risks and unknowns very seriously, not breathless cheerleading full of bolded text like those pamphlets you used to get in the mail from crackpots trying to rally people to some cause or other. The latter will convince the teenagers who are DCA-ing their way to a whole 1/10th of a coin, but it doesn't convince the grown-ups of the world who can put real skin in the game and propel adoption to the next level. They can smell the willful blindness to risks and unknowns all over this thread and it reinforces their impression that crypto is for kids.",

If one TXs P2P as per design, there are no such issues.\n\nThe problem is people have taken a system based on simplicity and began adding so much fiat-encroached shit on it, that privacy for users using centralised services is dead.\n\nPrior, with KYC alone, one didn't have to whitelist addresses. But now, change-UTXOs and badly managed UTXOs can be tracked and traced EXTRA HOPS and known with an extremely high degree of certainty which addresses is goes to. It's a matter of time before many CEXs and centralised services work together to create their own intranet of allowed addresses.\n\nIt's ridiculous how so many just don't get this. This doesn't affect me personally, but the fact it can, and will, affect so many and they're not seeing it is sickening.",

Surely someone who can understand the latter has 0 confusion over the former?\n\nIs your audience general, or do they have a background in cryptography already?\n\nIf the former, perhaps strike out #5, #7, #8, #9, #10 - that's just not needed.  And #6 isn't so much a misconception as it is a diverse topic, because you are already not focusing on Bitcoin alone based on your course title, I presume.  Once you count other cryptos, you will find that actually ASIC mining is the outlier, not the standard.\n\nAbout the BTC focus - I think #3 is wrong for some non-UTXO cryptos.  And the way you have written it, your clause \"**since** wallets do not store your coins\" makes it sound like the reason a transaction doesn't send/receive coins is precisely because of the wallet's structure.  Well that isn't true.  It is because of the UTXO nature of Bitcoin and other currencies that a transaction changes ownership of existing UTXOs rather than \"sending\" them somewhere.  The wallets for *all* cryptocurrencies don't store coins, because a wallet is as you point out elsewhere a keypair with some sugar, hook to the blockchain, and UI poured on top of it.  The tokens are on the blockchain just like my $ is in the bank's database despite me having my bank's app on my phone to see it and interact with it (god willing).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt almost seems like your list isn't really \"misconceptions\" but \"miscellany\".  Even the 21m BTC item is on your list as a trivia point relative to ETH rather than a myth clarification (the myth being, \"Anybody can just change the software and make more BTC\" or \"How do I *know* there's only going to be 21m?  Who decides?\")\n\nIf that's the case, consider separating it into categories of miscellany like \"Cryptography in Bitcoin\", \"Economic factors behind mining\", \"NFTs and who the fuck cares really ;)\", and \"Token growth schedules, burning, and the merits therein\".\n\nIf going for true myths, check out the Bitcoin wiki for examples to get the juices flowing.",

                    "response": "https://armantheparman.com/why-bitcoin-only/\n\nI want to start by stressing that it all comes down to scarcity. Without scarcity, cryptocurrency may as well be fiat. Good money is scarce. The biggest weakness of cryptocurrencies is that they can be created easily from nothing. All alts are like this. But Bitcoin is different. It has miraculously been born and has gained a huge lead in network effects. This can not be copied. Thus, it has gained scarcity. It is extremely decentralised, and has by far the greatest hashing power on the planet, and distribution of full nodes, which makes it not possible to tamper with the monetary policy. Bitcoin has scarcity due to network effect lead and \u201cun-tamper-ability\u201d.\n\nThe Lindy effect will only make it stronger as day after day it doesn\u2019t die. It can\u2019t be eradicated, just like a cancer that has spread too far.\n\nThe copies cannot compete with this. It needs the majority to not only leave Bitcoin, but mostly leave to the same choice. There are thousands of choices, so those few people that abandon Bitcoin will not all go to the same choice. In other words, defectors will disperse, not concentrate. The only way this could theoretically happen is if there is some fatal flaw with Bitcoin, AND it can\u2019t be fixed, AND an altcoin can, AND only one altcoin can.\n\nE.g. let\u2019s say Bitcoin\u2019s privacy weakness (really it\u2019s a trade off, not a weakness and any other coin with privacy just chooses a different trade off) is suddenly critical and everyone is exiting. Where will they go? Monero, Zcash, DASH, some to ETH and XRP (not private btw), Cardano\u2026. Can they all be money? Money printer go brrrr much?\n\nSo how else can an Altcoin take over? Remember that people will save in the best money. An Altcoin must become fundamentally better. In the open source world, how is that possible? It\u2019s like thinking it\u2019s possible for a better operating system to exist than the dominant open source one today (GNU Linux). The open source leader just gets better and better. All new ideas get absorbed.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine another currency finds a good use case. Let\u2019s say smart contracts. First that\u2019s like saying paper is money and valuable because contracts can be written on it. No, you need to make good money first, not find other uses for it. Aluminium has more uses than gold but it\u2019s less valuable because it is not money. It can\u2019t be money because it is not scarce. But even if smart contracts makes a cryptocurrency into good money, there are too many: ETH, Cardano, TRON, Iota, probably others.\n\nAs soon as any becomes valuable, it will invite competition and it will be copied. There is no scarcity. For goodness sake, ETH doesn\u2019t even work yet. Its Turing completeness is not even used. Bitcoin has smart contract capability and I understand nearly everything ETH is doing program-wise can be done with Bitcoin. Let\u2019s face it, it is competing with Bitcoin as a money and is far far behind and has no credibility. What will Vitalik Buterin do with the monetary policy next?\n\nETH is just another fiat with a central banker. That is not a true cryptocurrency. Remember why Bitcoin was born \u2013 we are fighting central banking and trying to separate money and state, not shoot ourselves in the foot by losing focus, trying to get rich by improving on the solution we already miraculously discovered. Bitcoin is that: a miracle \u2013 and we should embrace it.\n\nAlso, you mention ROI. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist so you can buy it and sell it for more fiat later. It is a REPLACEMENT for fiat. You buy and NEVER sell. You spend once it achieves its true value. You don\u2019t need an exit strategy. You just save in Bitcoin. With alts, you need to time your exit and sell to a greater fool, because alts are scams, holding forever will get you rekt. Just DCA Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s like picking up gold off the ground before anyone else realises it will become money. Don\u2019t pick up pebbles or seashells (alts), your pockets have limited space. Finally, the most important problem to solve is separating money and state. All other problems are tiny in comparison. We don\u2019t need to replace the legal system with smart contracts. We don\u2019t need a token for everything. We don\u2019t need to put bananas on a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is an invention that solves a humanitarian problem. Altcoins take a solution (blockchain) and try to find a problem. Remember that.",
