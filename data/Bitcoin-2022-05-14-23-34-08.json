The significance is that although Bitcoins\u2019 price may change, it\u2019s still 1 Bitcoin (out of the 21 million total there will ever be. A strong cap on supply is more unique and important than it may initially sound.) \nPeople who believe Bitcoin will be a base layer for all financial activities believe the importance is attaining a supply of Bitcoin (or satoshis, satoshis = 1/100m of 1 Bitcoin), we don\u2019t care about the current price because it\u2019s not a short term investment.\n\nHash rate is the relative security of a network. Bitcoin has the highest hashrate compared to all cryptocurrencies. \nBitcoins network is therefore most secure and hardest to attack.",

It is getting stronger compared to other currencies that haven't stopped the money printing. I don't care who you are or what bridge you are trying to sell me...printing 40+% of all your nations currency in the span of 2 years IS going to have repercussions going forward that we haven't felt yet. \n\nThe BTC to Dollar exchange rate is being affected by the fact that those who purchased BTC as a speculative asset are moving their money out of BTC back into dollars because they are fearful of a market crash.

The amount of actual money printed and put into circulation in 2020 was only $146 million, which is comfortably below average.\n\nWhat happened was that the Fed increased its balance sheet by 40% ($6.5 trillion), temporarily taking ownership of assets whose prices had fallen to free up liquidity at banks. They do this sort of thing every time there is an economic shock, recession, etc., because their mandate is to keep the economy afloat and keep unemployment as low as possible. If they don't free up liquidity in times of crisis, then they risk deflation, which typically leads to depression and sky-high unemployment.\n\nNow they are shrinking the balance sheet by $90-95 billion per month. If growing the balance sheet is equivalent to printing money (but it really isn't), then shrinking the balance sheet is equivalent to burning money (but it really isn't).",

The majority of collateral is entirely virtual gambling debts, ie mortgages secured by the \\*belief\\* that home values always go up.\n\nHardly any of the dollars are secured by knowable principles that govern the universe and allow higher output innovation to occur.\n\nThe collateral is all guesses.\n\nWhat causes the instability of this system? The debts grow at compounding rates due to usury being a fundamental presupposition. All dollars(debts) are issued with interest that compounds at arbitrarily set rates. \\*There are no objective reasons for why an interest rate is what it is\\* just like a sports stadium has arbitrary rules.\n\nThere is always a shortage of sufficient credit worthy borrowers in this system which causes offered goods/service to always exceed money.\n\nWhere does the inflation come from? Again usury. Compounding requires prices to \\*increase\\* if innovation isn\u2018t increasing productivity fast enough. What has kept prices lower? Wage arbitrage ie wage slavery. Enslaving inferior cultures has allowed the NY-London based dollar system to work this long.\n\nAs the labor force collapses due to the unrepayability of the debts, the total liabilities will be collaterallized by fewer and fewer sweat equity meaning a nominal inflation and physical deflation.\n\nThe physical economy is \\*deflating\\* while the virtual-dollar economy is hyper inflating.\n\nCan bitcoin \u2019protect you\u2019?\n\nNo.",

It's very easy to say that \"X network can process more transactions than bitcoin with significantly less energy consumption\". The energy consumption is for securing/maintaining the most immutable database humanity has known so far. I challenge you to identify a computer database more resilient to data alteration than the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nSo, the solution to the \"environmental concerns for mining\" is green energy production, which is still not a bitcoin issue.",

You can come up with or at least draw very good arguments against many aspects of bitcoin one at a time. However bitcoin is such a complex system that it needs to be understood as a whole and coming up with arguments that dismiss every interesting aspect of bitcoin is difficult. Its a very forest for the trees kind of thing. (You can see it in how difficult it is explaining to noobs. Its ne concept ontop of new concept ontop of new concept. Peoples attention span starts to wane if you don't catch their interest in 3 sentences.)\n\nFor example. People will say bitcoin can't be a currency. Sure, in our existing framework maybe it can't. The common critique is that bitcoin fluctuates, clearly they forget there are many currencies where bitcoin has never gone down. They have inflated worse than bitcoin dropped so bitcoin just looks like its going to infinity no pause. Bitcoin is a unit of account, property, currency, store of value all in one. We almost need a new word and a new framework through which to understand it. \n\nFor your average Joe, Its like they got the wooden block wooden hole toy for their first birthday. Now it's their 30th birthday and they got a ps5. For some reason they really want to push the ps5 through the square hole.",

Even with the lighting network overlaid there are still transaction costs to open and close a channel.  The fees associated, based on the energy consumed, make this unscalable in it\u2019s current form.  (Happy to go into plenty more reasons why it won\u2019t be used as a currency too, such as it\u2019s deflationary nature, but scalability is the easiest one to cover).\n\n2/ Bitcoin will not be taken seriously as a stable store of value for another at least another 40 years, probably longer.  To be a more attractive as a store of value than the currently available options, the price of Bitcoin needs to be predictable over the long term.  Risk models for other stable assets like bonds or metals still price in events from the 70s and 80s.  Even if the price of Bitcoin stabilized today, the regular 50+% drops Bitcoin has experienced in the last decade will be priced into it\u2019s risk profile making it unattractive as a store of value (note wild upside is not a plus for a stable store of value, that\u2019s a feature of a speculation vehicle).  The volatility of Bitcoin has only gone up in the last 5 years not down.  This is not an indicator of it being a stable store of value any time soon.\n\n3/ Bitcoin isn\u2019t a good uncorrelated asset.  There was for a while a school of thought that said Bitcoin was very useful as part of a portfolio, because it high upside that moved in an uncorrelated way to the rest of the market, allowing it to perform a diversification role in a balanced portfolio.  That is no longer the case, Bitcoin tracks the NASDAQ.  Maybe one day this will change, but that\u2019s where it is right now.\n\n4/ Intrinsic demand.  The value of every currency is ultimately based supply and demand.  There is intrinsic demand for USD, every tax paying person or business in the US pays their taxes in Bitcoin.  The largest single buyer of goods and services in the world (us govt) will only pay you in USD.  Every time a gallon of gas is purchased anywhere on earth, some of that transaction ends up in USD.  Bitcoin cannot match that any time soon.\n\nSo it\u2019s not useful as a currency, it\u2019s not useful as a store of value, it\u2019s not useful to stabilize a portfolio and there\u2019s no intrinsic demand.\n\nThese are my arguments against Bitcoin.",

I say that it doesn\u2019t have to be the global day to day currency to grow substantially from here and provide a useful service. Personally my \u2018maximialism\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily extend to the hyperbitcoinisation mode where it becomes the global defacto base settlement layer. Even assuming that the vast majority of day-to-day txs occur on L2 solutions, i\u2019m not sure the base layer could handle batch settlements of custodial accounts on 7xs per second.\n\nWhat bitcoin is good at is moving arbitrarily large sums of value easily - the average tx is $350,000 or so (median way smaller), and 20% more value transfer than visa network already. That alone could provide ample use case beyond what it is currently doing.\n\npoint 2. Agree, perhaps not the exact  timeframe but sure. Same goes for \u2018inflation hedge\u2019 - On short timescales it is too volatile, on long timeframes what we really benefit from is the overall network growth- not the monetary hardness itself. So it seems disingenuous to call it an inflation hedge, though from the block reward issuance standpoint that comparison to fiat is sound.\n\nPoint 3. Timeframe for reference v important, from my perspective this is a look and see for x years.\n\npoint 4. Generally agree, remains to be seen how much basal demand bitcoin will ultimately have on a currency front. But will it devour a certain %age of real estate/land investment on the basis of being a digital allegory of such? Looking at btc/usd on a log/log chart, one might conclude btc/usd pair pulling to an asymptote at $200k-1mil/btc, higher if you\u2019re optimistic of btc aggressively taking over multiple use cases.",

The only thing that differs is the scale and nature of the faith and hope one cares to partake in.\n\nAt the base level of all value structures and legal fictions lies faith, ultimately there is no escaping it, and i suspect we are beholden to faith and happenstance more than we might care to admit.",

Miners will need better hardware and more electricity.\n\n>  so the floor price will be determined by the cost of energy.\n\nNo.\n\nAre you aware that hashpower and transaction throughput are not connected?  If miners mine harder (more electricity, more tech) it does not change how many transactions are processed.\n\nIt has been said many times, but I'll say it again: miners do not affect the price of bitcoin, and they do not affect how high fees are.  I suppose that would change if a single mining cartel controlled the market, but that isn't the situation now and it seems unlikely to be where we end up.",

As a result, my best guess is all assets (stocks, bonds, gold, crypto) are going to go down big time in USD price terms. As rates rise, I believe it will cause a huge delevering for hedge funds, retail using margin, boomers entering retirement, etc. Long term I think bitcoin will continue to grow but I think I\u2019ll be able to buy back in <$20k and increase my number of coins by 50-100%.",

It's not all bad.\n\nAnother trope: \"inflation makes the dollar worthless!\" ..... no it doesn't, because inflation also improves workers' wages. And inflation adjusted wages were at their all-time highs in Feb 2020, and are not that far from that level right now.\n\nThere's lots of fake dogma among the Bitcoin bulls, and it gets amplified by the echo chamber effect that you mentioned.",

I'm not saying people will stop spending. I'm saying that people will be less inclined to spend. This isn't really up for debate or down to personnal opinion. It is logical, and is what is typically observed in deflationary economies.\n\nAnother issue with fixed money supply is that you cannot increase it to match economical growth. This is a problem because prices drop and so someone who produced something in the past will have been compensated more for it than someone who produces the same thing at a later date. This means that it favours people who where there first. This is a problem for future generations.\n\nJust look at bitcoin as an example, it favours people who were there first. Now you might think \"well, just get in early\". But you can't really say that to a kid who isn't born yet.\n\nWhat I am trying to get at, is that in an ideal world you want to match the money supply to the economical growth. Keeping inflation at 0, meaning no inflation, no deflation. Now this isn't easy to do, sometimes you'll overshoot it, sometimes you'll undershoot it.\n\nThe thing is that if you aim for 0 and undershoot it, you go into deflation, which can down spiral. So you typically aim a little higher than 0 to be safe.",

It does not, for an objective number of reasons.\n\nNever mind that even if you culled all the bots and shills, most \"perspectives\" are from people who are some combination of incorrect and ignorant, simple math.\n\nYou might think it is some form of freedom and equality to have corrupt or dunce opinions clogging the communication channels, but I'd say giving equal platform to them is a form of suppression and the antithesis of progress.\n\nThis form of metadiscussion regarding opinion is just yet another tactic to create confusion where there is none.\n\nSome things are simply not up for debate by the unwashed masses: that's what makes them unwashed. Clickbait culture making everything a sensational reimagining and earthshattering revelation have the people who couldn't pass basic aptitude tests on any given subject conflate their lack of understanding with \"critical issues\" that need to be resolved, and somehow end up with them thinking that the platforms that they shit on are the pinnacle of discourse.\n\nThey're not, the discussions and real work just happen without them as they're not really useful, and those who have work to do are busy doing the work, not giving out lessons to sway hearts and minds.",
