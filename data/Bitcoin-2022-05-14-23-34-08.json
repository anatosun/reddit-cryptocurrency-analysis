It doesn't even include the dollars printed in 2021, and the first quarter of 2022.\n\nPeople around Reddit are saying \"the dollar is getting stronger!!1\". No it isn't. It is getting stronger compared to other currencies that haven't stopped the money printing. I don't care who you are or what bridge you are trying to sell me...printing 40+% of all your nations currency in the span of 2 years IS going to have repercussions going forward that we haven't felt yet. \n\nThe BTC to Dollar exchange rate is being affected by the fact that those who purchased BTC as a speculative asset are moving their money out of BTC back into dollars because they are fearful of a market crash. But your SATS haven't lost value in compared to the other SATS on the market...they will only go up in time.",

There is no money supply.\n\nAll dollars are claims on someones sweat equity. That is all.Your neighbor flipping burgers at mcdonalds may have qualified for a mortgage and those new \u2018dollars\u2019 are backed by his future burger flipping.\n\nYou are always either a creditor or a debtor or a combination of both in this system. The majority of the population is a debtor-creditor being overweight towards the debtor side.\n\nThe collateral that backs the dollars(loans) is completely arbitrary and subjective. The majority of collateral is entirely virtual gambling debts, ie mortgages secured by the \\*belief\\* that home values always go up.\n\nHardly any of the dollars are secured by knowable principles that govern the universe and allow higher output innovation to occur.\n\nThe collateral is all guesses.\n\nWhat causes the instability of this system? The debts grow at compounding rates due to usury being a fundamental presupposition. All dollars(debts) are issued with interest that compounds at arbitrarily set rates. \\*There are no objective reasons for why an interest rate is what it is\\* just like a sports stadium has arbitrary rules.\n\nThere is always a shortage of sufficient credit worthy borrowers in this system which causes offered goods/service to always exceed money.\n\nWhere does the inflation come from? Again usury. Compounding requires prices to \\*increase\\* if innovation isn\u2018t increasing productivity fast enough. What has kept prices lower? Wage arbitrage ie wage slavery. Enslaving inferior cultures has allowed the NY-London based dollar system to work this long.\n\nAs the labor force collapses due to the unrepayability of the debts, the total liabilities will be collaterallized by fewer and fewer sweat equity meaning a nominal inflation and physical deflation.\n\nThe physical economy is \\*deflating\\* while the virtual-dollar economy is hyper inflating.\n\nCan bitcoin \u2019protect you\u2019?\n\nNo.",

Even with the lighting network overlaid there are still transaction costs to open and close a channel.  The fees associated, based on the energy consumed, make this unscalable in it\u2019s current form.  (Happy to go into plenty more reasons why it won\u2019t be used as a currency too, such as it\u2019s deflationary nature, but scalability is the easiest one to cover).\n\n2/ Bitcoin will not be taken seriously as a stable store of value for another at least another 40 years, probably longer.  To be a more attractive as a store of value than the currently available options, the price of Bitcoin needs to be predictable over the long term.  Risk models for other stable assets like bonds or metals still price in events from the 70s and 80s.  Even if the price of Bitcoin stabilized today, the regular 50+% drops Bitcoin has experienced in the last decade will be priced into it\u2019s risk profile making it unattractive as a store of value (note wild upside is not a plus for a stable store of value, that\u2019s a feature of a speculation vehicle).  The volatility of Bitcoin has only gone up in the last 5 years not down.  This is not an indicator of it being a stable store of value any time soon.\n\n3/ Bitcoin isn\u2019t a good uncorrelated asset.  There was for a while a school of thought that said Bitcoin was very useful as part of a portfolio, because it high upside that moved in an uncorrelated way to the rest of the market, allowing it to perform a diversification role in a balanced portfolio.  That is no longer the case, Bitcoin tracks the NASDAQ.  Maybe one day this will change, but that\u2019s where it is right now.\n\n4/ Intrinsic demand.  The value of every currency is ultimately based supply and demand.  There is intrinsic demand for USD, every tax paying person or business in the US pays their taxes in Bitcoin.  The largest single buyer of goods and services in the world (us govt) will only pay you in USD.  Every time a gallon of gas is purchased anywhere on earth, some of that transaction ends up in USD.  Bitcoin cannot match that any time soon.\n\nSo it\u2019s not useful as a currency, it\u2019s not useful as a store of value, it\u2019s not useful to stabilize a portfolio and there\u2019s no intrinsic demand.\n\nThese are my arguments against Bitcoin.",
