            "selftext": "So I've used Lightning Network before, and it was relatively cheap. Having said that, on another S/Reddit, it was pointed out that in high usage times, it can cost up to $50 to open a channel.\n\nI have read a few articles that suggest it can be around 20k Sats at the moment.\n\nMy question is, if LN is meant to allow BTC to scale as a P2P network, is setting up a channel going to be cost prohibitive for most people. I mean, if I have to spend $5-50 each time to set up a new channel, does that defeat the objective of it being a fee-less/cheap payment system? This could go contrary to the narrative that it will be much better to use than the 3% fees you get on Visa?\n\nWondering if anyone can explain this well, as there seems to be a lack of well written articles/information on this.",
