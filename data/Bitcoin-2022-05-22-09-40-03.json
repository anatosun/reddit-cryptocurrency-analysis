Having said that, on another S/Reddit, it was pointed out that in high usage times, it can cost up to $50 to open a channel.\n\nI have read a few articles that suggest it can be around 20k Sats at the moment.\n\nMy question is, if LN is meant to allow BTC to scale as a P2P network, is setting up a channel going to be cost prohibitive for most people. I mean, if I have to spend $5-50 each time to set up a new channel, does that defeat the objective of it being a fee-less/cheap payment system? This could go contrary to the narrative that it will be much better to use than the 3% fees you get on Visa?\n\nWondering if anyone can explain this well, as there seems to be a lack of well written articles/information on this.\n\n[Coin Telegraph Article - Trans. on BTC $60 at peak](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-average-transaction-fees-lowest-in-two-years-at-1-04)\n\n[Chart showing Avg Trans at $40 on BTC](https://preview.redd.it/zjmqgsine2u61.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2272736820305a62c178844fc27363e80c67cac)",

But if 1 Satoshi = $1, the minimum tx is ~250bytes, we'll be paying north of ~$250 for a tx.\n\nFor ppl that do not have a stack in cold wallet, they will be onboarded directly to LN, and only move to L1 cold storage once it is economically viable.\n\nAlso, bitcoin L1 scales with a principle troughput>blockspace, so devs are finding ways to fit more transactions into 1mb blocks before even thinking about increasing block space, but at some point that may be inevitable too.",

That chart is not showing the transaction fees that were required to send a bitcoin transaction. Many Bitcoin users and Bitcoin service providers choose to grossly overpay for transaction fees.\n\nThe time it takes for a bitcoin transaction to get included in a block depends on how many bitcoin transactions are currently in the mempool and how large their transaction fees are relative to their weight.\n\nYou can view the transactions that are currently in the mempool and see what an adequate transaction fee for a slow, medium, and fast bitcoin transaction is on this website: https://mempool.space\n\nThe mempool is currently getting cleared after every block. So you can currently send a bitcoin transaction with a transaction fee of just 1 sat/vB and it will get included in the next block.

Either party can close the channel and closing the channel would broadcast the transactions onto the blockchain. To open a channel it costs the same as a single bitcoin transaction on the blockchain. On the lightning network you don't need a direct channel to everybody you are making transactions with but it works like network routing does in routing IP packets across ISPs. You only need to be connected to the lightning network as long as there is a path to the entity or person you are trying to transact with. The lightning network has near instant transactions, reduces congestion on the blockchain, and results in cheaper fees. It can also be used for atomic swaps between two different crypto currencies. However, with that said businesses with lots of channels can become hubs or centralized nodes in the network.",
