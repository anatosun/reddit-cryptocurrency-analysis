            "selftext": "So I have recently gotten into monetary theory. Basically, transactions in the world of fiat are pretty much all just debt being thrown around in the form of government currencies or bank deposits. This means that most transactions change the amount of debt and thereby the amount of money in circulation.\n\nNow, my question is this: Since many coins has a fixed supply but can be lent out, is there a way of knowing how much there actually is including the debt? Do you know any reliable data sources to find out how much bitcoin (or other crypto currencies) have been lent? \n\nI think this might be especially interesting for DeFi since I wouldn't be surprised if a large amount of ETH for example might be borrowed multiple times. That's kinda what yield farming is about right? Also any form of investing on margin.\n\nNot trying to offend anyone here, really just looking for data or other input.",

Ethereum will always print as many coins as it needs to in order to pay for its own security, no matter how much it might cause inflation of the coin. It balances this money printing by creating demand for the coin. It requires gas to be paid in Eth, and requires stakes to be denominated in Eth. Ethereum is printed and the taxes are burned. \"We don't tax so that we can spend, rather we spend so that we can tax.\"",

I think that might be the place to go if you want to try and determine long and short interest. \n\nIt looks like there are some Dune graphs for Aave, Maker, and Compound loans you could try to use as well. https://dune.com/datanut/Compound-Maker-and-Aave-Deposits-Loans-LTV Dune Analytics is always a good resource for this kind of stuff. It lets you put your own graphs together based on publicly available variables on the chain. I think they're funded by Gitcoin grants.\n\nMost of these protocols overcollateralize though, so they're not actually increasing the circulating M2 money supply or whatever. I think.... so... the main culprit for that would be Tether, right? That's what people always complain about, that Tether is undercollateralized so they \"BaSiCaLlY ReInVeNtEd ThE FeDeRaL ReSeRvE.\" I don't know how accurately we can speculate about Tether's reserve holdings.",
