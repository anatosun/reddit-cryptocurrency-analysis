Perhaps think of it like water and ice: both are the same underlying stuff, just in different forms.  \n\nLightning transactions are basically unbroadcasted bitcoin transactions, which you can broadcast at any time you like, so they become finalized. They're still bitcoin.  \n\nKeep in mind, that in order to get on the Lightning network, every satoshi needs to be confirmed on-chain (and same when going back from Lightning), that's where the networks \"touch\", but they're still separate.",
