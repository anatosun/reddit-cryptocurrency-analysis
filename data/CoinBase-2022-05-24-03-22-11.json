Phone support won\u2019t let me through as my cell doesn\u2019t match an account that is open. They won\u2019t help me via email as my email isn\u2019t on an open account.\n\nThey don\u2019t seem to be interested in helping. Should I file a police report? I don\u2019t know what to do, but I\u2019m trying to tell them this is fraud and to close the account.\n\nAnyone have any advice?",

The accusation is perhaps spurious, but the District Attorney won't know that, since he and his supervisors for case review won't be smart enough in these financial systems to say categorically that crime was not-committed.\n\nAs soon as the case gets up to case review for lift, they may jump on it since the ninth circuit has been chomping at the bit to dissect every nanometer of these bizarro financial ponzies and moreso the way in which these ponzies are advertised to lure in dumb money for free rake and no risk to Coinbase.  Right now it's just in this weird grey area of nobody knows what's goign on except the level 5 devs doing binance transactions.  And even they are probably in an: \"I donno what these things are except they seem to work\".\n\nSo it would sail right up there because the government wants to put a leash and a rake on it.  We just need to get things up to activation and realize that we can make money for ourselves by drinking from coinbase's bottom line rather than playing their IOU altcoin shellgames.\n\nNext action would be #oneofus purchasing some hours with an attorney specializing in creative financial fraud, and seeing if the case has a chance to be a career-making one.  The delisting of the ponzie after it extinguishes could be the thing that elevates what happened to one of the 14 thousand US code definitions of money-from-nothing hocus-pocus financial fraud.  Lawyer gonna have to read a EULA lol.",
