(This is why these softwares never auto updates - it gives people time to vet the changes or listen out for controversy before updating)\n\nHacking a bitcoin node is pretty useless unless the user has a wallet on the node, then it has money to steal, otherwise it's hard to imagine any attack that would cause any problems without getting onto a majority of bitcoin nodes.\n\nHacking a lightning node is more interesting because they are guaranteed to also be hot wallets and so there is monetary gain to be made. But in terms of affecting lightning functionality (the way it works) it nodes assume each other to be malicious and double check everything, so you might cause a payment attempt to fail here and there, but the network knows to reattempt multiple times and exclude nodes it thinks caused the problem. What I'm saying is that just like bitcoin nodes, a compromised lightning node simply excludes itself from the network and the rest of the network remains fine.",
