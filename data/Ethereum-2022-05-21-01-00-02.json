When they say \"2.0 soon\" for years, that's on them, not Ethereum development.\n\nIn 2016 the developers thought it could be done easily, and where building towards Casper FFG. [In 2018 they realized that it wasnt feasible and scrapped it](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1029905990085357568). Between 2018 and 2021 there was never any delays - they had more or less started over. \n\nIn December 2020 the beacon chain launched. At that point the launchpad specifically warned that funds could be locked 2+ years - it wasn't close. No date was set. \n\nNow, 4 shadow forks have been successful. [The 3 main testnets are merging, Ropsten is first in 29 days](https://wenmerge.com/). It's actually close. All the code is done, and its proven to be working.\n\nOnly people uninterested in Ethereum development are crying about delays. Thats the only way to miss what has happened, and why this particular \"merge soon\" headline is different. I get it, we want it all, we want it now. We want Ether to pump while the only thing we do is hodl.\n\nThe biggest game changer for Ethereum users is layer2 rollups. They scale Ethereum. They make the fees cheaper than other L1's. They are already live. They are constantly improving.\nThe wait was over 6 months ago, people just didn't get the memo. \n\nhttps://l2beat.com/\n\nhttp://ethl2s.com",

What people expected from 2.0 will not be delivered and the focus has shifted completely from monolithic to modular design.
