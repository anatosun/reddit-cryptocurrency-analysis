Took them about 6 hours to reject each one so I was waiting for over 24 hours already after my final attempt to withdraw got rejected again (this was particularly painful to experience because I essentially got locked out of a very important opportunity for me, unable to buy during a specific period). I've been reading that this has been happening more frequently too. What exactly is up with this platform? Should I be worried that I won't be able to withdraw my tokens at all? Also, do you have suggestions for better exchanges where this doesn't occur as often as in Binance?\n\nEdit/Update: This was me trying to withdraw my Sol tokens. It turns out the network was congested. I decided not to wait for the congestion to lighten and to just convert them to USDT > Transfer to KuCoin > Buy Sol again to transfer to my Phantom wallet. \u2728\ufe0f Thank you for all the comments! \ud83d\ude4c",

In August, the UK issued a notice stating that the company lacked written permission to operate there. A similar warning was issued by Germany.\n\nBinance has been working hard to demonstrate to European regulators its commitment to practicing compliance and promoting the blockchain ecosystem in the region. Binance announced in November that it would invest 100 million euros to \"support the development of the French and European blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystems\" as well as establish a research and development center in France. \n\nBinance, which was created in China, has mainly abandoned the country as a result of Beijing's broad crypto ban. Many Chinese-founded cryptocurrency companies have relocated their headquarters to Singapore, which is swiftly becoming a regional powerhouse for blockchain entrepreneurs. Binance is understood to be looking for a new home, having announced in December that it would withdraw its licensing application and cease operations in Singapore.",

According to a company blog post, this is Binance's first such license in Europe.\nAfter receiving preliminary authorisation to operate as a broker-dealer in virtual assets in Abu Dhabi last month, the business is expanding its global activities.\nDue to its decentralized nature, Binance has never had a single headquarters, which regulators dislike because it lacks accountability. Last year, a slew of regulatory agencies around the world issued warnings that Binance was not permitted to operate in their jurisdictions.\n\n\"We are grateful to the AMF and ACPR, who displayed a commitment to innovation that allowed Binance to navigate the full application process,\" Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in response to the recent news. Binance has always placed its users first, and as a reputable DASP registered in France, the crypto community can now have even more confidence in Binance France.\"\n\n\nIn my opinion Binance global expansion of operations is exciting news for the crypto community.  The platform has earlier in the year obtained licenses to operate in Bahrain, Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The Platform seeks to create a global market for itself. The platform's obtaining government certification to operate gives Binance accountability and without a doubt creates trust with the government, regulatory bodies and users.\n\nThis will no doubt help the whole Blockchain ecosystem has it grows and would no doubt aid the development of new innovative projects within the space such as  Silks a blockchain-based metaverse that enables users to own, trade, and profit from thoroughbred racing horses, Faith tribe which is a platform for creating trading, distribution, and monetization of designs of fashion, Luckyblock which  is a digital asset project that decentralizies the lottery process via blockchain technology.\n\nThe Blockchain and crypto ecosystem is rapidly growing has cryptocurrencies are being adopted by financial institutions and government bodies around the globe. Binance global expansion and it's securing regulatory agreement would without a doubt help solidify cryptocurrencies entrance into the  mainstream.",
