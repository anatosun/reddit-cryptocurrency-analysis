That type of custodial rule is standard for financial firms such as futures platforms, but crypto exchanges routinely mingle their funds with customers\u2019 holdings in the same pot \u2013 a situation the administration wants to see ended by legislation. The securities industry commonly commingles funds, but the investments are also more heavily regulated.",
