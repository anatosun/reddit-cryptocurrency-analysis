If a Rolex costs around $10,000 retail and is being resold for $20,000 or a Patek Phillippe watch costs $30,000 retail and is being sold for $120,000, BTC is worth more than its current price. If the US printed $13 trillion alone from the pandemic, BTC is worth more than its current price. If gas costs more than $6 a gallon at metropolitan areas and the price of a car has a $5,000 markup minimum, BTC is worth more than its current price.\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m not even thinking about thinking about selling my Bitcoin or using it to buy anything with it until it reaches $2 million, because I think that\u2019s the fair market value present day. Anybody else agree?",
