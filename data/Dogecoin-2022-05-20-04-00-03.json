And YOU carry ALL the risk. Borrowers can and will default if things go bad. At which point the middleman says \u2018we\u2019re so sorry, but your coins are gone\u2019.\n\nSecondly, what can anyone do with borrowed coins? Not a lot really, other than shorting the market and thereby driving prices down. Is that what you want?\n\nSo yeah, get your coins out and into wallets you actually control. Ideally cold storage in the form of text wallets. Only ever leave coins on an exchange that you\u2019re actively trading.",
