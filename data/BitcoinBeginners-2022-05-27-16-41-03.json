Is there a way to get around this or shall I try another exchange? I\u2019m in the United Kingdom) \n\nThanks in advance.",

This has been an on going saga for around a year or more, searching online you'll find relevant UK rulings and news around Binance and retail investors using their platform. Again personally for what its worth, after navigating through different exchanges from the UK if you wanted to DCA into Bitcoin. Coincorner is easily the best in terms of lower buy fee approx 30p almost insant free bank transfers into a councorner account. The spread on spot price is pretty bang on and lightening capability to withdraw out. Otherwise from a 'trading/ limit order buys/ sell' I've found FTX, Binance, Coinbase Pro to be decent, oh and Kucoin for dirty shitcoins.",
