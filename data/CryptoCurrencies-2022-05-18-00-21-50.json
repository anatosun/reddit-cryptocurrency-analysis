With the Silent Transact method, no information between the sender and the receiver address is shared in the blockchain. With other methods and coins, everyone can easily track you down by following all your transactions on a blockchain explorer.A single transaction with SilentCoin will break your funds track in the blockchain, leaving a hole that can no longer be followed.\n\nContract address: **0x9bCf5001848F4332a4E168Bf4Fc91c84556Cff5A**\n\nMinting price: 0.01 BNB (x 100'000 tokens)",
