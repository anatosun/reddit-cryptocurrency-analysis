The price may flicker below for a day but the average HAS NEVER seen a decrease\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc On my chart it is at .0695 and has been growing by about .0004 each week! As the stock market continues to get rocked, people will sell out of it and will place money into cryptocurrency to \u201crisk it for the biscuit.\u201d As people start to see large gains in cryptocurrency and losses in stocks, the sheep will come to us and they will brag about their gains to their friends and family creating a bubble of followers and DOGE will be pushed to new highs. When the stock market is destroyed, small businesses will be able to thrive again and add value! After cryptocurrency will be on the hunt for the real estate market and will make home prices drop so the working man will be able to buy a home for their family again. Then, after all markets have been destroyed, cryptocurrency will be able to take on its last and greatest opponent: the dollar of the United States of America. When that is destroyed by cryptocurrency, it will have done its job and the American family will be able to 1) survive on one income working at a place you love, 2) buy and payoff a home for below $100K and preferably away from big cities, and 3) live in a country that isn\u2019t ran by tyrannical big politicians. This is the way my friends, this decade will be taught for years on how all Americans were freed from bondage and restored to its glory - true glory is measured by the strength of families and not by the power and greed of the elite. May God bless the United States of America!\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",
