            "selftext": "First, BEWARE of any other uses posting with links for compensation for LUNA. They are ALL scams and it\u2019s so unfortunate that there are human beings out there who have no sense of morals. NEVER CONNECT YOUR WALLET TO A LINK FROM SOMEONE YOU DONT KNOW.\n\nFor those who lost money in LUNA\u2026understand, this was not a scam. LUNA was an experimental crypto in decentralized finance. The concept was vetted by many and carried risk. Those risks were publicized by many if you spent any time doing research. There were many however who believed in the project and the basis of the concept. This a a very unfortunate event. And my heart goes out to anyone who lost money in LUNA (which includes myself). However, this happens. This happens in the stock market (think 2008 / Lehman Brothers ENRON, etc.), and this happens in crypto. ALL investments carry risk. And some more than others. The more risk you take on the more reward. And the more risk. That\u2019s how the system has always been set up. In any market. Note that there were extremely wealthy investors including the CEO of Galaxy Digital, Mike N., who lost billions in LUNA.\n\nMike is a very saavy, ex Goldman Sacks exec who founded Galaxy Digital. He went so far as to get a tattoo of LUNA recently. My heart goes out to Mike and I hope he regains himself after this and is successful in the many other projects he still has investments in. Just because he still is wealthy doesn\u2019t take away from my compassion for him. I feel for anyone who lost any amount of money.\n\nFor anyone who is distraught. Please please please don\u2019t let yourself be taken further advantage of, whether through scams like this poster above asking for your wallets to \u201ccompensate you\u201d, or by taking on further risks to make up for it. Regain, rebuild, reinvigorate yourself. Life moves on. And so will you. It might be hard. Very hard. Extremely hard. But I can promise you one thing. This will pass with time.\n\nI wish everyone here all the best. And I sincerely hope everyone is successful and regains what they lost. This was an unfortunate event, but again, it happens. No one is at fault. This was an experimental project that went south. That\u2019s all.\n\nSo let\u2019s all take a deep breath. Try to regain our composures. And let\u2019s learn from this. Because every mistake is also a lesson. So let\u2019s learn from this in anyway we can. For some it will mean to assess risk differently. For others it will mean to not risk or invest more than you can afford to lose. For others it will be to not hold onto assets for longer ithan you should. And yet for others, it will mean learning to get up in the morning again and realizing life is NOT over. It\u2019s just another day, another lesson learnt.\n\nLove & peace to all, -A fellow LUNA investor",

That's a ponzi scheme.\n\nThey were minting and burning coins to keep UST at $1 while boosting the price of Luna while paying out 20% interest, all at the same time, with nothing to back any of it up until it was already starting to collapse.  The idea was that if they could keep bringing in more people to buy more Luna and get them to trade it for UST, nobody would realize it wasn't sustainable since everybody was in profit.  That's a ponzi scheme.\n\nIn this case, it was a Do Kwonzi Scheme.\n\nAnd it collapsed, as all ponzi schemes do.  In two days, the supply of Luna went from 377 million to 6.5 trillion.  And now they're trying to lure in more suckers with a promise to save it?  To get Luna back to a price of just $1, it would have to have a market cap of 6.5 trillion dollars, and even then, it would still be down massively, from $116 last month.\n\nRight now, the market cap of ALL crypto, combined, is 1.3 trillion dollars, so the idea of getting Luna back to even just a dollar is silly.\n\nI love crypto, but I think this entire community has too many scammers and too few people willing to call them out.",

I recently commented on a post people were commenting on about buying millions of LUNA at under a penny. It upsets me that they want compensation if LUNA is forked. People that lost real money should be the ones compensated and not the people who took advantage of a broken system. They need to halt the chain and stop all trading. It\u2019s like a kick to the nuts the longer it goes in. I don\u2019t even like reading the posts about it but it\u2019s everywhere.",

I almost had a similar experience to you. I\u2019m fact I lost more than $2,000 in LUNA. On top of that, I also purchased more as LUNA was falling in an effort to average down my costs.\n\nI have so many questions, including;\n\n\u2022 What did Do Kwan do with the BTC in reserve? I saw that the CEO of Binance asked the same question. It seems the BTC was sent to one wallet that was traceable but then it went to an exchange. While Do said in his tweet that he didn\u2019t sell any of his LUNA, nor profit from LUNA. I am very skeptical about that BTC. I strongly believe he has it somewhere.\n\nI keep thinking perhaps he\u2019ll wait till all the selling in LUNA capitulates and then use the BTC to purchase the trillions of LUNA that were minted, and burn them, drop USDT (no more dollar peg), and completely focus on the LUNA eco-system with LUNA.\n\nThat would be the best case scenario in my opinion and allow all holders of LUNA to benefit from that, by essentially then keeping the whole LUNA infrastructure as it was.\n\nAll that being said, I also know I have no control over what happens at this point, so have come to the conclusion that I accept my loss, and am willing to move on. I do hope I learn from this mistake and while I intend to continue to invest in various crypto currency projects, I want to see a real team with a care for the community that shines through since I feel Do was extremely arrogant, selfish, and he kept many investors and even new buyers with hopes that LUNA would recover tweeting about a \u201cnew plan\u201d and other statements seemingly making it seem like it might, thereby causing much more losses than it would have been.\n\nWhile my heart goes out to all LUNA investors who lost any amount. I have very little compassion for Do, since I believe he maliciously caused more harm, which is unforgivable.\n\nThat being said, IF he ends up doing what I suggested above and that was the plan, I\u2019ll eat my words and write an apology. But until that happens, I can\u2019t wish him well, as much as I try to have compassion on every human being.\n\nScammers and those that take advantage of others, I have a very hard time forgiving. Unfortunately there are many of them. It\u2019s sad.\n\nWishing everyone great fortunes going forward!\n\n-A Recovering LUNAtic",
