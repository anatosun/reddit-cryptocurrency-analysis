            "selftext": "Let\u2019s begin to highlight this on Wednesday evening when Luna began its death spiral, suddenly falling from $80+ to 65\u00a2 trying to maintain their stablecoin peg against a blackhat attack, this is where the deviation begins. While on major exchanges like FTX and Binance the bottom falls out on Luna to 7-8\u00a2, Coinbase\u2019s offered wLuna, a derivative*, hovers around 40\u00a2, offering a terrible, massive premium to customers for hours. Suddenly we receive an update from their @CoinbaseExch account:\n\n[https://twitter.com/coinbaseexch/status/1524837573503266816?s=21&t=DwwpkRpYahJH5RbtAGz4Rw](https://twitter.com/coinbaseexch/status/1524837573503266816?s=21&t=DwwpkRpYahJH5RbtAGz4Rw)\n\nWithin seconds Coinbase begins to allow arbitrage against their own clients and the premium of 400%+ disappears. Hmmm. Who is the beneficiary and who is the victim?\n\nFast forward to last evening. Terra Luna death spiral continues down to micropennies as their float grows from 3-400M to 6 TRILLION plus and the \u201cstablecoin\u201d is destroyed. Coinbase wLuna and actual Luna price are now aligned. The wheels have come off. But WAIT. Terra Money halts their chain a second time:\n\n[https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1524935730308456448?s=21&t=DwwpkRpYahJH5RbtAGz4Rw](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1524935730308456448?s=21&t=DwwpkRpYahJH5RbtAGz4Rw)\n\nIn fact it is still halted right now, shuttle, wormhole bridge down. There is no possible way to arbitrage against UST/Luna anymore, and the float is huge at 6T+. HOWEVER, the wLuna trading on Coinbase has a 500x smaller float at 17B, and now the heat is on. Upon the halt, wLuna rises 7000% on CBPro. Bottom callers now have Coinbase\u2019s book by the balls on a short squeeze to even 4\u00a2 from .000008\u00a2\n\nHere\u2019s where the fishy behavior arrives. Suddenly Binance halts liquidity for all Luna at .00004\u00a2. Meanwhile, Coinbase wLuna is trading just shy of 1c, up 7000%, at .0035. Suddenly some weird activity appears* on EtherScan. See the transactions from ~3AM forward here:\n\n[https://etherscan.io/token/0xd2877702675e6ceb975b4a1dff9fb7baf4c91ea9](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd2877702675e6ceb975b4a1dff9fb7baf4c91ea9)\n\nOn a paused chain, the pool of wLuna somehow grows from 17B to a staggering* 980B+, nuking the price from .0025 to .000005. How? Well let\u2019s dive into the above EtherScan. The results will be dissected over days, as there* are millions of TXs. Did Binance use their BSC to liquidate $LUNA into wLuna to stop the squeeze?\n\nOn the surface, though, something fishy that happened was Coinbase suddenly expanded CBPro wLuna wallet deposits/withdrawals from 7k (prepped for $50 Luna) up to 10 BILLION per wallet. How could this adjustment happen so suddenly, unless they knew to open the flood gates of custody for themselves or the arbitrage actor?\n\nBottom line: Coinbase deserves what is coming from this deep dive into Luna, their book, and the actors involved. They willingly destroy their own clients for fun and are on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\nPlease speculate and ask questions.",

You take your $100 USDC and buy 200 UST. You then turn straight around and sell 200 UST for $1 each of LUNA (because the LUNA/UST is still artificially pegged to $1 USD even though the wider market for the UST peg has crashed). \n\nSo, if LUNA is trading at $0.02 and you sell the 200 UST = 10,000 LUNA. \n\nThen you turn straight around on a DEX (automatic market maker so your trading against a liquidity pool and don't need a buyer for your sell trade) and you sell the 10,000 LUNA @ $0.018 for USDT = $180. \n\nSo, $80 profit from $100 invested and this creates a constant selling pressure of LUNA as the artificial $1 peg is maintained between LUNA and UST. \n\nThis is nothing more then a version of algorithmic trading where a miss match in market pricing is found and exploited. All the above could be automated by anyone with algorithms/bots already in place for other needs, just redeploy them on the fly to exploit the irregularity. \n\nThen wash, rinse and repeat and it's a free money glitch as long as trading of LUNA and UST remain open and it creates constant sell pressure and the value of LUNA keeps tanking.\n\nThe fundamental flaw with algorithmic stablecoins structured like LUNA/UST is that it works as a stablecoin just fine while the market sentiment TRUSTS it to work.... Where it becomes INHERENTLY unstable is when market sentiment DOESN'T trust it and there is a \"bank run\" as people bail out of UST. That then creates a situation where the mechanism used to stabilise the UST peg can be exploited by arbitrage trading and it creates a death spiral as the minting mechanism constantly attempts to regain the stablecoin peg but that in turn just incentives arbitrage trading even more and the selling of LUNA.",

As long as you are alive and breathing, you will always have another chance to recover from this. Please prioritize your physical and mental health, as there are more important things in life than money.\n\nI am no expert and absolutely an amateur but if there is a continuous crash, it will most likely recover in months/years. Patience is absolutely vital. Being impatient is wrong. I learned it the hard way.\n\nPersonally, I admire and support UST's mission. Because the USD will eventually fail, the goal of the UST is to create a stablecoin that is not backed by the USD. Terra was backed by bitcoin. The experiment will be adjusted and carried on. Sure, changing the global monetary system takes time, with ups and downs!\n\n**Terra is the layer 1 blockchain like Ethereum or Bitcoin blockchain.**\n\n**Another, there's a project called Terra Virtua that has nothing to do with Terra Luna. The companies share a word in their names, but that's all there is to it.**\n\nTerra blockchain has two tokens:\n\n1. LUNA (the native token of Terra blockchain)\n2. UST (the stable coin on Terra blockchain)\n\nUST is a stable coin and the price is pegged to $1.\n\nTo mint $1 UST the algorithm will burn $1 Worth of equivalent LUNA. This means that if UST demand increases the supply of LUNA keeps reducing. There is 20% APY for UST (which is very good for a stable coin) and this keeps pushing the demand for UST.\n\nThere is one problem with this algorithm that you can redeem UST for LUNA which means you can burn $1 UST to mint $1 worth of LUNA.\n\nWhen UST starts losing its value from $1, users panicked and redeemed it for LUNA and this create a huge supply of LUNA coins and more coins are sold on the market. This is a domino effect and creates more panic with the price dump.\n\nThe team is also minting to support the UST price but is unable to make it stable and is dumping LUNA on market.\n\nThe team is trying to stabilize the price of UST. Terra has announced plans to burn $1.4 billion\u00a0$UST and stake 240 million $LUNA.\n\nAlso, we may see the delisting of LUNA from major exchanges because of the price drop like Binance CEX did.\n\nLastly, I'd like to express my overthinking. Because we know how desperately the government wants to control Stable Coins for a long time, we may see this happen again for another stable coin. This is the opportunity they have been waiting for to see if something is truly adequate for something.",

The collateral is a proof of stake coin that must offer staking. They stake and do liquid farming with the token, staking can reward from 4-11% depending on the network activity of the said coin and with liquid farming they are atleast able to gurantee 9-10% yield (for details on liquid farming you should look it up: its basically providing liquidity to amm dexes). for other 10%, they get from the interest paid by the user, the interest for borrowing is 11-20%. therefore the golden 19.5% apy.\n\ni may be wrong some details here and there but it was a plausible method of offering high yield.",

Anything is possible right now, and if you are optimistic enough, you will buy the dip and eventually get out as a big winner.

This started the entire hysteria path the last 24 hours. If you ever have to work on a terms of service or financial disclosure, financial compliance is a bitch and they make you put every single backstop in there to protect the company, almost none of which is helpful for aspiring confidence in the company or sales.",

But i'm also pretty sure there will be people out there seriously considering this. I have no personal or financial advice for these people since i'm not qualified to give advice like that. Please seek help from a professional, they can help you figure things out. Don't be ashamed by it, they have seen worse things.\n\nI just want to remind every one of you again: Don't spend money you can't lose. This is the most important rule of investing in anything. Every market can crash, even when you expect it the least.\n\nMost people say they are okay with a correction of 50 or even 80%. This may be true for many of you. But there are a lot of people out there that are not okay with it if it happens for real. And of course, if the money you worked hard for is 'gone' you will feel emotions, that is completely normal. But if you have spent money on crypto that you can't afford to lose (even if you only need it in 10 years) it will hurt differently.\n\nDon't get to greedy. Don't over-leverage yourself. A lot of times it will work out just fine, but if it doesnt, you are fucked.\n\nEveryone, please. Think about what will happen to your personal life if your whole portfolio goes to 0, will it change your life in any negative way? Please think again if the investment is a good idea.",

I have solana on avg of 92$, matic at 1.7$ and eth at 3k$. I started enjoying my life so much more after not looking at the markets everyday, that money is invested and I believe in these projects, mostly for gaming or social media use of blockchain. Hopefully these will have a great use case in the future. I am not really planning on selling but on using these tokens to buy gane skins, or playing videogames or cool stuff for VR and metaverse. Anyway, hope you all can just chill and enjoy your life, have very clear that crypto is here to stay and its highly undervalued due to the speculation and lack of real world utility. Just wait, leave your investments and enjoy your life and use your salary to buy gifts for your girlfriend, friends or parents. Enjoy your life guys",

Married my ex after 9 years found out he abused my daughter 3 years prior. Restraining order, courts, house auctioned. Went into new owners name yesterday. Been looking for a new place for a year too. Everything is sky high. City truck totaled my car 2 days ago. Hitting it parked on the side of the road. My means of earning income is gone and still don\u2019t know if my insurance check will be big enough for a replacement. Now I\u2019m carless and facing homelessness with my 10yo son. My daughter is out of the house. And now she\u2019s pregnant. I don\u2019t think that would\u2019ve ever happened if what transpired didn\u2019t transpire. I\u2019ve lost my whole life and this whole drop in what I had put in to the markets to help us is making it worse. Im not down everything probably not even that much compared to a lot of people l. . I can\u2019t and won\u2019t sell because it makes no sense. It\u2019ll help me for a couple months then I\u2019ll be broke again. All I can do is hold and hope and pray this gets better. I don\u2019t know what else to do. I wouldn\u2019t have posted this anywhere else except a post like this. No I\u2019m not a shill no I\u2019m not fud\u2019ing but the struggle for a lot of people is real. And I pray it\u2019s temporary. And I hope this posts helps people get through it. There was no indication he\u2019d of done what he did. Nobody in his family even believed us when she finally came out. Until we got him on camera admitting it. Yes I blame myself. I was working and providing doing what I thought was right. Who knows what\u2019s right anymore.",

But we don\u2019t require any of this to live. As a father, I can say that happiness and health are the things I covet the most, which money can\u2019t buy. Sure, health care is expensive, but you will receive care even if you don\u2019t have the money (I\u2019m sure people will poke holes in this statement to some degree). Happiness is something you can steer for the most part and is a choice in most cases. Health is partly cards your dealt. I would rather fight my way into the ground than to throw in the towel and that sort of mentality is what made great men and women throughout history. I\u2019ll leave it to Dylan Thomas\u2019 poem to say the rest .\u201dDo not go gentle into that good night,\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\u201d",

Crash the market, force them to cash out everything to the point that they're so stressed and frustrated, they give up and go work at McDonald's for $10 an hour because they see no other choice and have to pay the bills somehow.\n\nThat's what I think the 1% are banking on. Otherwise they'd have to start paying everyone a livable wage! Give everyone free healthcare! You know, allow people to be happy! But that's too complicated for them to understand.
