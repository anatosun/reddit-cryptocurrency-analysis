                    "response": "These kinds of people are angry and fearful. You can see it in their writing. They're not interested in truth, or a raw technical evaluation. They're just trying to arrange words in a way that makes them feel better about their bags, and assauge that lingering doubt in their mind which is fearful of XMR. \n\nNonetheless, it's worthwhile to address these weak (and cliche) criticisms, because we don't want to leave a leg for ignorance to stand on. So here goes.\n\n\n### Yeah that's the altcoin with only 2,769 reachable nodes. (Bitcoin has over 50,000 nodes lol)\n\n1. It looks like we might have 10k to 12k nodes. https://monero.fail/map    \n2. These are just visible nodes, so likely we have quite a lot more behind firewalls.   \n3. But okay, Monero does an average of 23k txns/day, so that's about 12% ratio of nodes, to daily transactions. If we take the number at 10k nodes, it's more like 43%. BTC does about 250k txns/day, with say 50k nodes, so about a 20% ratio. In reality, these are estimates, but overall, Monero has a comparable amount of community participation in the node infrastructure as BTC, perhaps even more. \n\nBut also, so what? Can anyone articulate or demonstrate exactly what, and *how much* additional risk is posed by only having 10k nodes globally, vs 50k? Redundancy reaches a point of diminishing returns. If maxis claim BTC is ultra secure with 50k nodes, then would 500k nodes confer much more marginal benefit? The goal is censorship resistance, and 3-12k nodes (again, likely more) should already be very robust. \n\n### could have an inflation bug and nobody would know because you can't audit the supply.\n\nFalse. Mathematically false. The cryptography for hidden amounts, uses the same type of logarithmic hardness which we rely on for digital signatures. You can prove that the inputs - outputs = 0 , for any transaction, without revealing the amount. \n\nAnd if we already rely on these cryptographic primitives for signing/verifying signatures, then why wouldn't we also rely on it for shielding amounts? They're both indispensable parts of the protocol.\n\nBut going a step further, an exploited inflation bug is catastrophic for either chain. Even if you could stop BTC within a few blocks (but could be hours or longer), it would immediately lose the #1 spot, and never regain it. Forever disqualified from the running as a global monetary standard, and some other crypto(s) would fill that place. Given the consequences are the same either way, this isn't really a factor.    \n\n### 90% of its hashrate coming from mining malware\n\nThis is where the person really starts to reveal that they're less interested in an honest discussion, and more interested in spouting off attacks. We don't really know what that percentage is, but one of the devs estimates maybe 20%. While blackhats exploiting people's property is bad, this isn't a centralization issue. There's loads of indepenent black hats, so they're not just one monolithic entity. From a network standpoint, they play by the rules, and contribute hashpower. Believe it or not, there are still portscanning botnets from 20 years ago roaming the internet, because they literally can't be shutdown, without killing the internet. So from a network security standpoint, this is more of a benefit than anything.\n\n### That's why it's not really profitable for most people to mine XMR at home.\n\nAs always, it depends on your electricity costs, hardware, and strategy. If you have a nice 8-96 core processor that you use for other purposes, and only mine in your spare time, then your hardware cost is effectively zero. So if you have cheap electricity, or you're doubling that rig as a space heater, then yes, you're gonna get some modest profit. \n\nNo you're not going to be able to make a massively corporatized and centralized mining farm out of it, which you operate with a govt obtained business license and permission with massive electricity infrastructure that you have to pick up and move every few years because govts change their minds about *ALLOWING* you to continue operating. But that's a good thing, and a big weakness for BTC mining, which *WILL* get censored and permissioned via OFAC and govt compliance in the not distant future. The ground work is already laid.  \n\n### minexmr.com mining pool currently controls 35% of monero's hashrate\n\nA hypocritical criticism, where people are looking for ways to denigrate, rather than investigate. BTC also had periods of time with over 50% hashpower in a single pool. BTC currently has 60% of HP in just 4 pools. Are we really going to pretend that the potential for 4 BTC pools to collude for 51% attack, is anything more than marginally better than 2 pools colluding in Monero?\n\nIt's a disingenuous argument, a hypocritical one, that hasn't followed Sun Tsu's first rule: \"Know thyself\"\n\nBut moreover, the solution is P2Pool, which is being integrated into the GUI, to make it easy for people to use.\n\n### kraken.com and monero will probably eventually be taken off of kraken.com because of regulations\n\nHmm, that's an interesting argument. So what you're saying is that Monero has properties that make the existing power structures nervous enough to try and attack at the corporate onramps, but for *some* reason, they don't feel threatened by Bitcoin? In a world where govts are colluding to victimize their citizens en masse, while simultaneously embracing Bitcoin, that alone should be concerning to anyone who joined crypto for the digital freedom money aspects. \n\nBut okay, I guess if you're a bitch, and just resigned to only ever doing what your govt allows you to do, then okay, you win that one.\n\nOh wait, except for the fact that the lead regulator for all US banks (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) said last year that: \"all blockchains are permissible for banking purposes, *including ones with enhanced AML risks*\" (paraphrased). And of course, Jesse Powell, CEO of Kraken stating that they were under no regulator pressure from the US regarding Monero. And the fact that banks already deal in billions of dollars of cash, and that exchanges are moving closer towards obtaining banking licenses.\n\n### altcoin with a ton of bag holders because it just keeps losing value to BTC\n\nAh the good ole last resort argument. \"Your number is going to go down forever.\" How about we turn that argument around on Bitcoin, and talk about all the coins that *gained massive amounts of value* relative to BTC, both in this bull market, and also since their inception. Let see here, if you had bought: Eth, Doge, XRP, ADA, XLM, and yes, gasp MONERO at the launch of each of those projects, you'd still be up significantly relative to BTC. And of course this bull market, the massive outperformance of altcoins relative to BTC is clear. Hell, even Monero at the moment is at the same price relative to Bitcoin as it was 2 years ago. \n\n**Maxi:** But all of those shitcoins will die forever relative to BTC value. \n\nSorry homie, but that's not what the price charts are saying right now. Besides, you're not allowed to make a vague and uncertain appeal to the future to try and support your case now, because I could just as easily do the same. I understand that maxis want to cherry pick the top of the 2017/2018 markets because that's best for their case, but it seems more reasonable to look at projects over their lifetime, not just from the top of a mania bubble.\n\nOkay, so hopefully that gives you some things to go with. These conversations are tedious and difficult, because maxis are very practiced at regurgitating the talking points spoon fed to them by their cult leaders. They make very generic and broad distortions and misunderstandings of the real state of technology, Monero, markets, and principles; which can take some time to parse. As they say, it takes 10 times more effort to dismantle BS than it takes to create it. \n\nBut for Monero, which is properly adhering to the principles of digital freedom money, and making parasitic power structures nervous; it's worth the effort.",

I don't see how that's an argument though, it's normal for a privacy coin.\n\nEven delisted it's easy to obtain though.

Since it heavily publicizes monero and acts as an on/off ramp, the monero community funded parts of it. \n\nNow, as a cryptocurrency exchange, haveno wants to support as many trading pairs as it can so that it appeals to a wide audience. This is beneficial to monero, because anyone using haveno gets introduced to monero. \n\nThose trading pairs include zcash. Many users dislike zcash for good reasons, and those reasons are magnified by zcash's position as the #1 competitor of monero. These people feel their investment in monero is being undermined, and I empathize with their fear. \n\nPersonally, I feel like we need to take a chill pill and accept that we funded a cryptocurrency exchange. That exchange is gonna support competing currencies, and I think it was kinda silly to ever expect otherwise.",

What the hard fork did was that it bypassed this rule. There was a block where developers played \"a god\" and decided how the money moves without knowing any private keys, bypassing cryptography checks.

But I do think what they did is worse because it sets a precedent for play with the accounts directly without cryptography. They really should've let the chain go on (which is what some people decided to do and the untampered chain is called ETC). It's also unfair to the hacks that are happening now. The dapps are still getting hacked and they don't get bailed out. Nobody should get bailed out or everyone should, bailing out only your friends (DAO CEO was at ETH foundation afaik) and leaving others at a loss is unfair. To be fair, helping friends is a good thing, but these chains can only exist if nobody has control to do that, that's the whole point and the reason we burn energy.",

I dabbled with Bytecoin and Digital Note (same family as Monero) but they had shady stuff going on (premines, team members unknown, minergate ties, etc). There were way more, meme coins (TurtleCoin), Karbo was a Ukrainian (I think) flavor that died, MoneroV was a forked scamcoin... lots of great drama. All suffer from lack of hype and mainstream adoption. If they had a stupid dog mascot maybe it would have been different 8).",

I stumbled upon the whitepaper of v2.0 written by Nicolas van Saberhagen, and I would like to quote some of the things he states which are pretty good to use for arguments within a paper to illustrate certain points of why, for instance, Bitcoin is bad compared to Monero.\r  \n\r  \nThe reason why I'm asking here is because after doing some digging, some people exclude CryptoNote and refer to Monero's privacy capability solely under \"ring signatures\" (which from what I've read, CryptoNote enables?) - so it's just confusing for me when people don't relate to CryptoNote and rather draw attention to only \"ring signatures\", as if Monero were to create it and implement it themselves.\r  \n\r  \nProbably just a simple misunderstanding from my side, but I just want to make sure.\r  \n\r  \nThanks.",

If bitcoins value goes up and no new coins will be mined, tx fees will go up, making people hesitant to move their coins, that leads to less profit for miners and therefor higher fees.

Because all this solid bitcoins turn to immobile concrete, then all this shiny digital asset will be so costly and so hard to move like your 3-room condo on the wrong side of the tracks.\n\nFor an asset to be considered a medium of exchange, liquidity (not the amount of units but their mobility) is essential and the hard cap will be counterproductive. \n\none has to put in consideration the continuous loss of coins (beside the wallets of Satoshi) people lose their keys or die and take the seed phrase to their graves, so the scarce concrete is deflationary and that is one more reason to hold and not to move it and \"bang\" tx fees go up again.\n\nI write this knowing that you know this, but these things have to be mentioned in public more often and more frequently, so sorry for hijacking the thread.\n\npeace",

I've heard that but no one has explained it to me yet.\n\nMy response was:\n\n> Many cryptocurrencies have a transparent ledger.  You or I can look up the balances or transactions for any address in the world and see everything.    For a business accepting BTC you could trivially find out their current amount of BTC is in that wallet and how much they sent as payment to distributors if they use the account or how much they charged other customers etc.\n\n>Monero solves this problem by taking the cryptography a step further and verifying consensus without revealing any transactional and balance information about anyone using it.  It is much closer to the current idea of fiat cash whereas transparent blockchain are more like your bank where everyone in the whole world is the bank\u2026. your spouse, your mom and dad, and your worst enemy.\n\n>Monero is constantly updated to maintain this footing of privacy versus people seeking to steal that personal information and so far is winning by leaps and bounds.  It\u2019s what BTC was meant to be in terms of the white paper imo.",

This version of the distribution will have much more flexibility than version 1.0.0.\n\nMy plan is to make the system as scriptable as possible and give more power to the user through a CLI interface easily accessible through SSH. This distribution also strives for efficiency using a minimal and fast init system called dinit to start the system in seconds from a cold boot. \n\nRight now the user is able to control the system easily within a tmux session over SSH. A few plans I have for this is having keybinds for the user to easily start and stop the mining software, monitor the mining software with ease, and possibly make a pinephone friendlier interface for if the user connects to the system on a pinephone.\n\nI've been hesitant to ask for funding, but have finally convinced myself to take a shot at it. I've been needing the money to build a completely dedicated Ryzen system for testing the CPU mining tools. I'm not asking for much most likely up to 1000 USD in XMR at most to build a decent system for development.\n\nI have already put videos up on LBRY/Odysee of the development. I've mostly worked on my Hive Pirate tools for GPU mining alongside CPU mining on the system. I have recently just started rewriting my CPU mining tools to be more efficient and easier to use.\nVersion 2.0.0 will be a massive upgrade to version 1.0.0. Once I get a release put together I will upload all of the tools and the distribution to Gitlab.\n\n[My Odysee channel](https://odysee.com/@wheezybackports:e)\n\nFunding address:\n82xNT9EtgeT1syXYP9L1Tf8uEsyBDXUg55V8fqL2bKs1bMrGRLGv4aqfiy8vypcSGsLS6TJ8ogWx51HciLrd6cd9Ga5g7TR",

And that might take some time.\n\nWe are probably better positioned however for price stability than Bitcoin, because there's a decent likelihood that the supply is more evenly distributed, and we don't have 4 year supply shocks like BTC.\n\nSo it would probably be good enough if we could have a moderately stable price that tends to rise steadily over time. At least, I think that's the ideal we could hope for Monero. You have to gain marketcap and liquidity somehow.",

If we want wider adoption, then we have to tell people why they should adopt it. In the status quo, the privacy aspect seems to be pumped more than any other, but Monero is much more than that. It is far superior to the most widely adopted crypto-commodity, Bitcoin, in many ways and that needs to be effectively communicated.\n\nJust my thoughts\u2026",

Sorry if this question is very basic, but I think it's good to ask if uncertain.\r  \n\r  \nSo let's say I buy XMR on a CEX like Binance and want to move it to another CEX like Kucoin. Is the transaction private if I do just that? That is, Binance doesn't know where XMR goes, Kucoin doesn't know where XMR comes from, and other people know nothing of all this?\r  \n\r  \nOr do I need to take an intermediate step by first moving bought XMR to a wallet like MyMonero before sending it to the other CEX to maintain privacy?\r  \n\r  \nThanks for your advice.",

Do I just buy litecoin from coinbase, send it over to my binance wallet, and there's an option to convert it to XMR? Also, why buy from coinbase and not just binance itself? Is it really as simple as that?",

The large majority of xmr was mined when the coin was very unheard of which places large amounts in the hands of very few. It will take lifetimes for the amount of newly generated xmr to match that of which was generated in a few years to a very very small amount of people. If Monero were to become mainstream, these random people would have insane amounts of wealth for little practical reason as I imagine these people didnt think Monero was going to get to that theoretical point.\n\nI wish the supply curve was a lot flatter as tail emission is coming up and Monero is fractions of its potential.",

Despite trying to research this point and the relationship between hashrate and energy consumption, I couldn't really find anything significant and just presumed the two were linked. \n\nAs I understand it now; due to RandomX, we get fewer hashes per second. But the consumption of electricity to get 1000 H/s for Monero could probably get you 100MHz if you were doing it for Bitcoin. So the while the hashrate might indicate the total power consumption for a blockchain, it depends on the hashing algorithm and also the hardware being used. So a lot of factors prevent hashrate being converted into energy consumption, and particularly so when comparing hashrate for different cryptocurrencies.\n\nIs that right?",

As a decentralized protocol itself it is extremely to ban. The government will not try to waste time on fighting with thousands of monero nodes across the world or try to arrest the devs and plant backdoors, it will kill crypto using the cheapest and easiest way for it which is administration orders and regulations.\n\nThe government has very little power in crypto space, however the government can easily control the traditional fiat gateways and tools. No matter how secure and anonymous crypto is, people always need to cash out, and this conversion channel can be easily killed by the government. Once this channel is dead or hard enough for normal people to access, crypto is doomed or almost useless because what you can do with your crypto is highly limited.\n\nThe example is China. CCP has successfuly built a highly sophisticated surveillance nightmare that even Snowden cannot imagine. All online fiat payment tools are under strict KYC regulations which means mandatory facial recognition + bank account verification(you need to physically go to a bank to open an account which is almost impossible to counterfeit). Techniques used for fighting credit card fraud is well utilised here, it will mercilessly kill any login attempt that seems suspicious. A login attempt from labeled anonymous proxies will instantly kill the account, and other suspicious activities like attempt to start the software in vm or sort of thing will also raise fraud score and might leads to account suspension in the future. If the account is suspended it is very unlikely to recover access. The AML is also insane, especially crypto trading will trigger AML alert very easily. The police has a skynet like database which has the information of everyone's online activities including all the accounts(almost all accounts requires KYC because all registrations require phone number and phone number has bank account level KYC), contacts and transaction relationships. It is very easy for the police to map the crypto related accounts and label them as dangerous(sometimes the police even disguise as p2p traders to find out who is buying crypto). When enough AML alerts are triggered a person's all online accounts can be frozen together and becomes digitally dead, which means you cannot pay for train ticks, rent a house and need to use cash for eating out. This 1984 style regulation is powerful enough to deter 95% of people from using any crypto.\n\nAlso no need to mention it is illegal for merchants to accept crypto, so direct crypto payment also do not work. Finally the government has network surveillance on provincial routers and national GFW. It detects any crypto related network activity and disconnect them from the Internet, my friend is banned from using network and called by the police because he tried to mine using his gaming GPU at home. Even it is not possible to kill all the offshore node servers, they can be easily blocked plus using an active firewall that probes all the potential proxy servers and kill vpns to further increase the cost of settings up a working crypto wallet.\n\nIt is impossible to fight the government with simply some  Internet tools, a political problem needs a political solution, since the government ultimately controls the ISP and financial infrastructure and can block access.It is just a cost problem for them not to block something. The problem is democratic system fails to restrict the power greedy government and the old western liberty dies out. It should be solved by figuring out how to properly regulate the power itself.",

A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.\n\nThe government authorizes a private corporation, the central bank, to generate money in order to pay interest on government debt. How do they do this? Investors are led to believe that the central bank is an honorable institution creating money through some legitimate business activity. In reality, they create money out of thin air, which would be called counterfeiting if anyone else did that, and _loaning_ it to the government, which would be called usury if international bankers hadn't had those laws rewritten too, thus creating more of the same kind of government obligations that incur interest. If that doesn't match the definition of a Ponzi scheme, I don't know what does.",

There are reasonable comparisons, and the marketing hype and claims don't match the Bitcoin product. Bringing these to bear, and showing why Monero overcomes them is very relevant.\n\nI can tell you as a buttcoin sub veteran (now kicked), Monero is maybe the only coin there that garners at least some respect. Precisely because we as a community don't shy away from legit criticism, and because Monero addresses many of the criticisms, and is actually used.\n\nBitcoin is a digital bearer asset, for now. Its other failings are why it became a wild speculative, risk on, gambling instrument, rather than digital freedom money. The sooner we recognize and acknowledge this, the sooner we can do better than casino style gambling",

If you want to spread the good news of Monero, you'll have to do it yourself, just like we all do on our little scale.  \nBut I'm not worried, it's not a race. The product speak for itself in the end. It's not for nothing that Monero is the coin accepted on all major darknet markets, when the need for privacy is felt, Monero is the obvious answer.",

The problem is society is just now starting to accept Bitcoin, barely. The main hurdle now is getting people to accept the consensus mechanism of both Bitcoin and Monero. \n\nI saw some individuals reference the dark markets. I think that's a good representation of how this will progress. The dark markets and users have historically been the first to adopt new technologies regarding privacy and security. They started with Bitcoin back with the silk road. As time went on we've seen most of them move primarily to Monero as their primary method of exchange. I think this is what we'll see on a large scale with the rest of society. \n\nOnce Bitcoin is commonplace, people will see its primary flaw. Its public ledger of transactions. When this becomes a problem people will look for a solution. That will be Moneros time to shine. \n\nFor now, though, I think we need to be united with the Bitcoin community. There is already so much division in the crypto space, rightfully so. I believe though that the Monero and Bitcoin communities are largely fighting for the same thing and that division among us will weaken our stance at this very important point in time. When the dominance of PoW is insured, I believe that's when we should have this discussion among our communities.",

Advertisements are for commercial products or services and Monero isn't that.\n\nThis propaganda is using [psychological reactance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4675534/) to automatically make the reader feel like they want to do the opposite. There are [plenty of examples](https://wizardofads.org/reverse-psychology-and-advertising-strategy/) of advertisements making use of this technique. A recent successful example is Patagonia using it in 2011; after this campaign they [quadrupled their sales estimates](https://bettermarketing.pub/dont-buy-this-jacket-patagonia-s-daring-campaign-2b37e145046b).\n\nFor people who don't know what Monero is and don't care to read the fine print, this is designed to act like a subconscious psychological reactance seed. For those who are hooked enough to read, it makes the reader question how some grassroots computer nerd movement could possibly weaken banks and states, two of the most powerful forces in our society.\n\nI've always liked it for this clever multi-pronged approach. All that said, there are probably better iterations of this that better fit with these times. Cryptocurrency has become more and more a part of the common vernacular so the point you made:\n\n>there's nothing in it to differentiate it from other cryptocurrencies\n\nmeans reduced positive impact on Monero by this propaganda every day.\n\n>even I could come up with something better than this.\n\nDo it, seriously. Then make a graphic and post it on the internet and see how effectively it spreads. If you find a winner make stickers and give them out.

Reverse psychology is sometimes referred to as\u00a0psychological reactance, which is the aroused state that occurs when a freedom is threatened or eliminated. The higher stake or more freedoms that are threatened, the more arousal that can be expected. People prefer to be free to select what they like. so when that freedom is taken away, they are motivated to restore it. Psychological reactance can be better explained as the idea that an item will be wanted more if people are told they cannot have it, which can relate to reverse psychology on some levels. Another influence technique that relates to reverse psychology is strategic self-anticonformity. Strategic self-anticonformity is when a person advocates a position that is opposite of their true thought, while hiding the fact that they are using a persuasion tactic. A common example of such is marketing techniques or tricks such as \"do not click this link,\" or \"do not push this button.\" Strategic self-anticonformity and psychological reactance relate in their expected negativity or disagreeableness from their influence target.\n\n- Wikipedia \n\nI know Wikipedia cannot be trusted for most information, so below is a more educational article.\n\n50 year review of psychological reactance theory: Do not read this article\n\nhttps://scholar.dominican.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=psychology-faculty-scholarship\n\nI recommend looking into this to get a better idea of how the \"Don't buy Monero\" advertisement is supposed to work. Or don't look into it the choice is yours.",

This impact is what makes someone more likely to look up the project and do their own research.\n\n**Appeal to og crypto ideologists**\n\nThere is a reason bitcoin was revolutionary when it came out. It was peer to peer digital money. The power it held was in an alternative from of money that could be used online without a third party needed. It's power never came from the establishment and banks backing it as their investment, it's true potential power was in creating an alternative system that would be more fair than the monopoly that central banks currently held and abused at the expense of most people. \n\nThis idea is what brought about most of the early users of bitcoin. It is still the same value proposition that bitcoin holds but it has been watered down as nothing more than marketing material for selling financial products around bitcoin. The thing is, there are still people looking for what bitcoin promised as the future in the early days. This ad targets those users and forces them to look into doing their own research. Which is all that Monero ads should strive for. \n\n**I would make one change**\nI would change \"cryptocurrencies\" and change it to \"anonymous money\". This can help bring to light the privacy issues you have talked about in your post. \n\nI think if you want to bring to light the tracking of users then more effective marketing campaign is in actively showing how easy it is to trace and correlate user activity to an address on public blockchains. Marketing materials then could be stickers that show something like \n\"What does your address say about you?\" \n\"CryptoTrackerlink\"\n\nThen you can show how that data is correlated and offer monero as the solution",

I said in my CCS proposal that I would use the transition from ring size 11 to 16 in the hard fork to help with the statistical estimation.\n\nI have a technical draft of part of OSPEAD that I can PM you if you wish.

The large majority of xmr was mined when the coin was very unheard of which places large amounts in the hands of very few. It will take lifetimes for the amount of newly generated xmr to match that of which was generated in a few years to a very very small amount of people. If Monero were to become mainstream, these random people would have insane amounts of wealth for little practical reason as I imagine these people didnt think Monero was going to get to that theoretical point.\n\nI wish the supply curve was a lot flatter as tail emission is coming up and Monero is fractions of its potential.",

There are ways to blunt this. \n\nDo a cash deal for 1k+ EUR.... well if it's e.g. a car, they have your reference when the vehicle is transferred.   In theory, if you say bought drugs with it, you are supposed to report it, or, when you get caught it will be an additional charge.   \n\nAs an anecdote, I had to renew my bank agreement recently and one of the questions was 'What's the average value you intend to withdraw in cash monthly and for what purpose?'.    \n\nIt's getting totalitarian here.   I have trading XMR and deep hold XMR and I can see a future where the deep hold stuff can't easily be brought back into my economy.   If so, well, I'll have to spend it in a different economy.. e.g. swap to BTC and withdraw cash in some place that has those machines.   \n\nIf that's the future I will insist on XMR payments from a few clients I have that simply could not survive without me.   That money won't fuel my day to day, but end up in the places that are still financially free.",

I have now looked twice at their website, curiously and with an open mind, and still have no clue what exactly should be the point of it all, and where exactly the interesting innovation lies. As long as I don't understand the \"this\", I cannot judge at all whether \"something like this\" could be done for Monero as well.\n\nI vaguely get that their consensus protocol has making Bitcoin transactions as part in there somewhere. Well, we all know what PITA making such transactions can be at times, with congestion and sky-high fees. If I am not gravely mistaken that could mean that if the Bitcoin blockchain goes through some hard phase Stacks won't work reliably any more either.\n\nFurthermore, if Stacks ever becomes really successful, and Bitcoin miners somehow think that the transactions of their miners disturb in any way, or if Stacks gets to be seen as unwelcome competition to Bitcoin itself, I would guess there would be ways to discriminate against those transactions, given that everything is so transparent with Bitcoin. This latent danger alone could already sink the project IMHO.",

If you need a durable and strong part, you will also need a powerful oven to heat the metal part and slowly cool it to eliminate internal stress.\n\nWith electron beam printing you dont need an additional oven. The electron beam can be defocus to pre-heat the powder, so you focus again to start the sintering process according to your design.\nThe uniform finish depends on the power and speed. You can give a metal surface a more uniform finish with the electron beam. Also you can create textures.",

There's an extended, open process with a lot of community feedback, and those team members fund their work through community funding proposals.\n\nThe responsibilities of the contributors are also pretty well sharded to avoid bus factors. A contributor could give more info on the specifics.\n\nThe forks have been very non-contentious. The only time I recall seeing anything resembling contention is when the RandomX fork came along and an ASIC Manufacturer tried to make it look like there was a grassroots movement to maintain the ASIC mining version of the coin. But I've not heard a peep from that project since-- they got universally panned. Everyone knew what was going on.\n\nEven if you believe that Bitcoin is the only coin that should matter, projects like Monero are still very important as they provide intense research and experimentation, and if Bitcoin does overcome them, it will become stronger doing it.\n\nIn reality I can't imagine a future where there won't be multiple coin options, with a few having the most acceptance with each pandering to different use cases, and atomic swaps running between them all. Few free market products don't have alternatives with varying amounts of adoption and their own fanbases.",

It's almost like they detest the idea of competition. But I suppose that's just the nature of the Free Market too. McDonalds thought nothing of Burger King until the Whopper came along, and then it had to address the competition. Monero I think is Burger King in this scenario. Will Bitcoin get dethroned like the Ford Model T? I mean honestly I'm down with that, but instead Bitcoin may be like McDonalds: There's competition, but McDonalds never went anywhere. Burger King (Monero) just joined in that permanent competition of the market.\n\nWhen it comes to currencies, I'm more interested in an organic competition of currencies (like Ron Paul has supported), while the Bitcoin Maximalist philosophy seems to be more interested in establishing the one new true currency.",

As such, the core consensus protocol was altered to prevent the proliferation of asics.\n\n*Regular* hard forks have been established in Monero to prevent a standstill like Bitcoin has for years, only some cosmetic improvements like SegWit *hacked in somehow* with a lot of contortions which could have been prevented and implemented much cleaner by simply hard forking. Pretty hard to understand there can be persistent consensus on compromises which are being made in the community the months before a hard fork for many Bitcoin maximalists who literally went to war in the block size question resulting in three different chains without a real solution. This was by the way the moment I quit Bitcoin end of 2015 and found Monero with its awesome dynamic block size which is - like mining itself - driven by consensus among miners and prevents one superior entity to flood the network with insanely sized blocks (BSV). When I then discovered the privacy features, I fell in love since up to that day I *believed* in the Bitcoin narrative of a ledger having to be transparent to prevent fraud.\n\nCryptonight ASICs came up much later and pushed a bit to keep the 6-month frequency for hard forks up (with releasing changes in the mining algorithm only like two weeks upfront) until RandomX came up. Since then never touched again and still working out great! I wonder what Bitcoin would do when sha256 would be considered broken at some point? Never hard fork.\n\n>Presumably these decisions are made by a small group of insiders. Further, who decides which chain is the true monero? Because all chain splits are inherently political, we tend to observe that some alternate chains are acceptable projects while others are labeled scams.\n\nHow many people have been actively involved in the implementation of SegWit? Schnorr? Taproot? There are no public dev-meetings in Bitcoin (as of my knowledge), one can only participate in mailing lists or on GitHub where I noticed a very ignorant communication towards new people, not only from Greg Maxwell. All those changes don't split the chain, however a not updated node is off the network since it doesn't understand most of what's going on on the network. Neither Monero is splitting the network when hard forking, but it has the possibility to implement new features best possible instead of shitloads of contortions just to not split the chain.\n\n>But the authority to designate a project as legitimate or not can lead to centralization of control and influence and, in the worst case, outright coercion. Bitcoin avoids this altogether by simply refusing to accept the validity of alternate coins.\n\nConsensus by ignorance. Weren't it the same people complaining about ignorance towards Bitcoin being superior to Fiat? I don't see Monero as an altcoin, I see Bitcoin as an altcoin sometimes useful for Fiat onramp, offramp is a harder story due to its lack of fungibility.\n\nIn the long term such ignorance and Bitcoin's non-development towards privacy and scalability without again some weird contortions in form of Lightning Network which has so many technical pitfalls or scams like Blockstream's proprietary Liquid network which solves (at least a bit) both of Bitcoin's main issues privacy (with at least stealth addresses implemented) and scalability at the cost of decentralisation towards a permissioned, centralised scam controlled by banks, will eventually fail.",

The legitimacy of Bitcoin as the real Bitcoin has definitely been questioned, in a long and ugly argument. Why would it matter whether the protocol change that triggered this conflict meets some technical definition of 'hard fork'? \"Bitcoin\" now has that label because people with influence chose that version of the chain to receive it, and vigorously campaigned against opposing views. It was a political conflict, in pursuit of a particular vision of what function Bitcoin should serve, and they won that conflict via political means. I am convinced that for basically everyone involved in that conflict, it is only a fortunate circumstance that this version of Bitcoin did not technically involve hard forks, rather than the true core of their convictions.\n\nIf the major exchanges had chosen to award Bitcoin Cash the \"Bitcoin\" name, assigned the core chain a different ticker, and all places where Bitcoin is discussed accepted this naming convention, it wouldn't have mattered for any practical purposes which chain had hardforked and which had not. The inescapable fact is that cryptocurrencies are defined more by community consensus than by rules-based consensus, and there is no way to avoid that. They will always be a function of our collective imagination. \n\nThat said, there are probably some worthwhile properties achieved by imagining that something is *not* defined by your imagination. Possibly if everyone pretends a particular set of rules is the true law and unchangeable, that actually does something to increase the political capital required to change them. Steeping yourself in delusion seems like a high price to pay for that though, and I personally feel more comfortable with a cryptocurrency community that acknowledges its own power to define that currency.",

Every node running a specific version of the software, and every H/s directed to a pool running a specific version of the software counts as a vote of confidence towards that version.  \nThe \"true\" Monero is therefore the version with the most votes of confidence.\n\nThe reason why the all the updates/hardforks have been pretty much non-contentious so far (except for that minor attempt from an ASIC manufacturer at saving their own business) is because the research and development of each update has always stayed true to the philosophical core of the project: permissionlessness, decentralization, financial freedom, and a strong focus on privacy and security.\n\nIf someone comes up with an improvement that makes our project better, faster, safer for everyone to use, and their code/math checks out - why would anyone be opposed to that?",

He just presumes out of his ignorance, that which is convenient for the narrative and conclusions he's already determined to arrive at. \n\n> Which chain is the true Monero?\n\nShort sighted, and even hypocritical. We've never ever had that problem. Because it has always been extremely clear where the hashpower lies, what the nodes choose to run, and where the community support lies. Besides, the answer is pretty simple and it's about the same for bitcoin. He just cant accept that btc isn't special like he thinks.\n\n> Because all chain splits are inherently political,\n\nEvery line from this guy just layers on more bullshit. We never had a chain split. Let me try to help you get inside his mind ... He imagines that Bitcoin, being the amazeballs best thing ever that could ever possibly be since the wheel, nothing could ever possibly do better. So *OBVIOUSLY* Monero has a chainsplit in it's future if it ever gets big ... but since it's just run by a narrow group of political insiders (PRESUMABLY (lmfao)), well then it won't be resilient enough like Bitcoin, because of all the hard forking happening all the time.\n\nliterally. This is how these people think. They can't even fathom anything outside their paradigm. That's why maximalism is a cult.\n\nThis is corroborated by this weird piece of hopeful fiction on his part: \n\n> But the authority to designate a project as legitimate or not can lead to centralization of control and influence and, in the worst case, outright coercion. \n\nNone of what he said in that above quote makes any sense at all in terms of Monero. There is no authority designating the project as legitimate. There are always centralziing factors due to the Github repo, but that's equally as true of Bitcoin, if not worse, demonstrably worse.   \n\n> Bitcoin avoids this altogether by simply refusing to accept the validity of alternate coins.\n\nUhhh, okay ... again, literally has nothing to do with Monero or the way in which we upgrade and achieve consensus for protocol upgrades. \n\nAnyways, yeah, the false presumptions, the bad paradigm, the weird mischaracterization.

This means that it is of course not only private, but also much faster and cheaper to use than Bisq. Haveno is also supposed to be simpler and more user-friendly, it has no DAO, and even uses a fundamentally different protocol for trades.\n\nIt builds heavily off of Bisq, sure. But to say that it's a *rebranding* of Bisq, and only serves to \"get clout\", is an outright lie.",

The 2 main issues I have are 1. calling Haveno decentralized and 2. the 5 people in charge of the money, the council.\n\n1. P2P isnt the same as decentralized. Like others have pointed out, many other DEXs arent actually decentralized. My original point was that Haveno was P2P not decentralized. To draw a comparison, haveno is like localmonero, bisq, and even craigslist could in some cases be considered P2P a platform/website but they are not decentralized. \n\nMonero, bitcoin, etc are decentralized from top down for the most part. Self hosted nodes, people committing to the repo, etc. This is decentralized.\n\nCalling Haveno a DEX isnt accurate and very misleading. \n\n2. The council controls the money that the Haveno devs receive. That council is made up of 5 people who are entirely unknown to us. In my opinion that is highly centralized. (I DO NOT want this to be political, I'm just drawing comparisons) It is like calling a democracy decentralized when even though in almost every case, the people dont directly vote the president into power. It is through a few representatives that dont always represent the populace. \n\nPotential Solution: The dev team directly receiving the funds via the CCS or other means from the community would be a straight forward way to remove doubt. \n\nOr if this was just a temporary solution I might be on board but I havent seen any discussion on that.\n\nConclusion: in theory Haveno is amazing but due to the way it is currently set up I dont think I could get behind it.",

Nothing I saw there and see now strikes me as suspicious or problematic, because I claim as a Monero dev I understand what they do, and why they do it, and how they do it.\n\nThe important point is \"as a dev\". I can easily see that for, well, non-devs, the whole Haveno development story so far may come over as \"Trust us, we are the HCT\".\n\nAnd if it does, then your answer to this may of course be \"No, I don't trust you, and I don't want to either\". And at this point of the road I see a fork ahead of you: You acquire more dev-related knowledge to be able to better judge yourself, or Haveno is not for you.\n\nBy the way, I do wonder why you so readily trust Monero and the Monero development model. I don't want to spoil your day, but I am sure that if you took a closer look how that really works with such a strongly critical stance that you grace Haveno with right now, you would be in for some surprises.",

Yet that person can develop a protocol and code that requires decentralized participation in order to function.\n\nThat is what Bisq does, and Haveno as well.\n\nIn the old days Bisq had a 2:3 multi-sig system with an arbitrator.  Arguably the arbitrator is a form of centralization and a pressure point.  I believe that nowadays they use a 2:2 mutually-assured-destruction system with no arbitrator.\n\nSo afaik, the *code itself* operates in a fully decentralized manner.  (Except perhaps for the price feed, which I think they maintain some servers for.   But that's a quite minor point.)\n\nI think what you are complaining about is mainly who the developers are (anons scary!) and how they make decisions about code changes (so-called governance).\n\nWell the fact is that decentralized systems operate with a system of consensus rules.  In effect, the network works by virtue of all participating nodes.   If those nodes don't agree then the network forks.\n\nSo then, the only **real** \"governance\" (forget the silly DAOs) is which software end-users choose to run (or not run).   if the haveno team develops software that is not truly decentralized, the community will realize it, and call it out, and probably not adopt it.  Or fork to remove the centralized bits.   and that's that.",

With a council you control the money and can influence the devs so if one or more of the members of that council flip or are bribed then there isnt much the monero community could do other than try to fork and rebuild a new Haveno alternative, decentralizing the development preocess along the way.",

GoTennas are $200 per pair though; a Meshtastic T-beam kit (transmitting via LoRa - also unlicensed, higher frequency, potentially shorter range) at ~$30 would be more in line with the cheap device goal. S2 Underground & Ham Radio Crash Course on YouTube both have good videos on Meshtastic, digital radio modes, and other comms-related topics.\n\nAs for the actual ham bands, sure, you could devise something to transmit transactions with a $25 Baofeng handheld, but be aware that you would be running afoul of the FCC & their unpaid ham toadies. I'm not one to fuss excessively over legality, especially after the last two years of our governments willfully, maliciously, & egregiously disregarding and/or weaponizing the law against their citizens, but if you're going to be a radio pirate, be educated as to the risks involved. Hamstudy.org is an excellent resource for preparing to take the ham radio licensing exam, even if you just want the knowledge and never intend to take it. I'm somewhat of the opinion that getting licensed is an opsec liability, personally. \n\nIn this same vein, u/unsignedmark posted recently to the Preppers sub (https://np.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/tqhtgt/i_made_the_prepper_version_of_the_internet/) about his Reticulum Network Stack project, which to me seems to show significant promise, and I'd be interested to hear what he'd have to say on this question.",

He's just a shill that say milquetoast platitudes, and makes grandiose claims about BTC that aren't backed up by reality. \n\nHe's not actually a friend of Monero. You can see in his language and in everything that he says, he's trying to contain and minimize as much as possible his audience towards using Monero. Essentially implying that only in the most extreme edge cases should anyone use Monero.\n\nHe was also abou 3 years late to even saying anything good about Monero or covering it at all. He's extremely overrated, and people like him do as much harm towards Monero as they do good.",

I don't blame him for holding onto the idea that Bitcoin can be better. But it's nice to see an OG who understands why crypto currency is important acknowledge and praise Moneros pros over Bitcoin when he is very careful not to give credit to the various coins that come and go.\n\nedit: also I may have misunderstood it but from my watching of the video he said Monero is an order of magnitude more private than Bitcoin and if you need to be private from governments than you should use Monero. The one pro Bitcoin has over Monero is Liquidity and market cap. Monero is only 3 Billion Market Cap so it can be hard to move large amounts of money. Now that wont always be the case but if you needed to move money today its good to evaluate the privacy trade offs with possible liquidity issues. I don't think anyone here would disagree with that.",

There was a couple years where some maxi ideas held some water, even if they weren't water tight. Kinda like metaphorical truth, if you pretend like everything else is a scam, you're less likely to get scammed. \n\nBut those days are over, and with the hindsight of 20/20, we can see the problems, compromises, and failings piling up. It's still minimally viable for certain things. but it's anyone's guess how much that will degrade in coming years.\n\nRegarding anonymity set vs privacy, if I heard him correctly, he said that BTC has a large anonymity set because of the greater adoption, but that Monero has technologically better privacy protections in the protocol.\n\nThe problem of course is that almost no one uses coinjoin or any privacy practices at all in Bitcoin, those methods have all shown to be quite deficient, and it's hard to say that Bitcoin has any real anonymity set at all, simply because any anonymity set that you might try to count, all have significantly, multilple orders of magnitude weaker obfuscation than Monero. \n\nSo it's hard to make a good apples/apples comparison. But in reality, if I'm not mistaken, even just the hard numbers of Bitcoin transactions made with a pseudo-anonymity protocol are dwarfed by the number of trasactions happening on the Monero blockchain.\n\nAnd Aantop doesn't bother with discussing any of that nuance, and then makes just blatantly inaccurate statements regarding this simple topic, with an obvious agenda of steering people away from Monero. \n\n I kinda take this video as a nice little picture perfect reason of why I used to like and listen to him, and now I don't",

Any given $1 bill is indistinguishable from any other $1 bill, assuming both are true, Fed-printed pieces of money.\n\nGold is **not** scarce.  New sources of gold are being discovered all of the time.  While the discovery of gold has slowed over the years, it continues to be discovered and mined at the rate of [2500-3000 **tonnes** per year by current estimates](https://www.providentmetals.com/knowledge-center/precious-metals-resources/global-gold-supply-predictions.html).  That's not taking into account the amount of gold that will enter circulation when asteroid mining becomes a reality over the coming decades.\n\n**Technically**, Monero is not scarce in the sense that Bitcoin is scarce due to the tail emission.  However, this is actually something I agree with in the long term due to incentive for network upkeep, and for all intents and purposes the inflation is so small and increasingly so that it can be considered scarce.\n\nSurely Bitcoin should have a + for track record, considering literally every transaction that has ever taken place on the network is viewable and verifiable from anywhere and by anyone in the world.  As well as the fact that tumblers have essentially been rendered ineffective by crypto tracking services like CipherTrace.\n\nJust some food for thought.",

Like Dash instantly saying they're not a privacy coin just to not be delisted.\n\nI just think people should put more attention to this, and consider talking about it when presenting monero or comparing it with other projects.\n\nEthereum for example has changed their monetary policy a few times already, and with PoS it will change again. You could argue that there is \"consensus\" on this but realistically speaking if the US and EU governments pressured their developers and Vitalik to change the monetary policy (maybe even behind doors) or get banned, I think they would manufacture consensus to appease governments. Of course I'm speculating but I think it's not that far from reality, and this talking about a project the size of Ethereum... One can imagine how it would be for smaller projects.\n\nWith Monero we know that this wouldn't happen.",

But also I don't like the narrative of just holding btc and then exchanging to monero when you want to spend because if everyone thought like that the price of monero would be very low (at least in current circumstances of low crypto adoption) and that would have implicatons for the security of the coin itself e.g. miner incentives. Monero is independent project and not only a private second layer for btc. \n\nThat said in terms of using crypto as digital cash (as originaly intended) I have no need for btc at all. I agree with the rest of your points. However, I also think adoption should not be based on whims of the government.",

Monero is likely to lead to a stable supply once the issue of lost coins is taken into account. What I see is an equilibrium between the fixed tail emission, lost coins which is proportional to the actual supply and price. This will result in a mathematically provable total emission supply and a lower and unknown effective actual supply once an unknown amount of lost coins is taken into account. This places Monero between Bitcoin and Gold, with Bitcoin hyper deflationary (falling effective actual supply) , Monero deflationary (constant effective actual supply) and Gold (effective actual supply tracking economic growth  over a multi decade time frame)\n\n2) The POW security question\n\nHere Monero has a very troubling message for Bitcoin and other falling block reward coins. The key point here that the Monero adaptive blocksize and penalty predicts that the Fee in Reward (the percentage of fees in the total block reward) in Monero will fall or at best remain constant as the blocksize increases.  This creates the following conundrum for Bitcoin like coins:\n\na) The cost of increasing the blocksize is higher than that in Monero. Example BTC with its infinite cost to increase the fixed blocksize. In this case transaction fees **may** replace the block reward, but there is no guarantee. \n\nb) The cost of increasing the blocksize is less than that in Monero. Examples BCH, BSV etc. The we know that as the fee in reward will below that in Monero so as the blocksize increases and even without a blocksize increase the total fees will fall to zero and the coin will become insecure. \n\nThe is an incredible amount of denial within the Bitcoin communities on this question regardless of whether we are talking about small blockers or big blockers.",

If one product is superior by even a small margin, it will eventually pull ahead given enough time. Economics always wins. \n\nYou might argue that a mass transition would take decades, and you might be right.

Partly because I don\u2019t view nominal price appreciation relative to fiat as something that is or will be unique to Monero. But also because greed is based in fear. So likewise I don\u2019t tell people dystopian visions of the future to convince them of Moneros merits. Where I tend to start is with \u201cthe money printer\u201d, and the endless varieties of corruption that have emerged because of this. To me Monero represents a chance at correcting many of these problems, an opportunity to actually progress beyond humanities current history-on-repeat loop regarding money, and a shot at having a more just society. I\u2019m not into Monero out of fear, I\u2019m into Monero out of a sense of determined optimism that we can steer the course of civilization back into the right direction.",

I spent two years exploring altcoins and in May 2020 I came to XMR via Dollar Vigilante. I had a few coins when it was around $60 but needed the cash for other things so sold it but kept it mentally in my back pocket as a coin worth looking more into in the future.\n\nI have been all over the place as far as altcoins go. I have explored them with vigor, investigating which ones truly have really good tech. I can say with full honesty that XRP is really good technology. Just try sending it between wallets and you will see for yourself. It's instantaneous and it costs nearly nothing.\n\nThen by May 2021 I scored on a shitcoin called Bonfire but had I held it for one more day I would have scored a lot bigger. So greed got the best of me and I put all my gains back in to new projects. Bitcoin crashed right after that and I lost all my gains from my investments.\n\nSo in my defeated state I sort of took a break from Crypto and contemplated how I want to move forward. I had to ask myself what am I really doing in this space? Am I just here to gamble? Am I just here to invest in things that I don't actually agree with at all, like XRP? I have been down the XRP rabbit hole and I do think it's a good investment opportunity, but I do not AT ALL agree with it philosophically, as it very well may be the bridge between CBDC's.\n\nDigibyte is really good tech as well, with 5 mining algorithms, but where's the privacy?\n\nThen Monero came back to me from seemingly nowhere. And finally it all clicked. XMR is really, really good technology AND I really, really align with it philosophically. I also realized it's really the only true Cryptocurrency.\n\nI almost decided to go in on Pirate Chain instead, but I don't like that it's part of some alliance and that it is a trusted setup. What if it's a Fedcoin in disguise, trying to push people out of XMR? I don't know, but I don't like the trusted setup.\n\nBut if any coin does replace Monero as being the best privacy coin, I will look into it. Dero is slightly intriguing, but I think that's more the Smart Contracts version of Monero. Not sure. I just feel that XMR has all the best attributes of the original Cypherpunk ethos and Libertarian/Ancap ideals mixed with extremely legit technology, and it does exactly what it says it does.\n\nLong story short, I don't feel a religious pull towards any coin as I have investigated many coins by now.",

As far as I know there is no really simple automated and turnkey way yet to receive Monero payments. It's cetainly not merely knowing \"what command lines to use\" with `monero-wallet-cli` and/or `monero-wallet-rpc`. The former is interactive only, and the latter can only serve as a backend and cannot handle payments all on its own.\n\nIf you are determined you may start your journey into Monero at [Monero Integrations](https://github.com/monero-integrations).",

                    "response": "Greetings,\n\nAs a novice to the CryptoCurrency space and XMR, I had thought to better understand what the future potential of XMR might be.\n\nThe general control of government over our financial well being be it through inflation or restricting funds (per subjective value judgments in the Trucker Protest and ongoing Russian conflict) is unattractive. The intention of Bitcoin, to my understanding, was to wrestle this control from the Government, permitting financial freedom. However, Bitcoin though an improvement over our traditional financial system with regards to governmental control over the money supply can due to its public ledger have its transactions tracked permitting the imposition of financial restrictions. XMR (through some complex systems) resolves the issue of this tracking, so as to be an improvement over Bitcoin. \n\nAlbeit, this is where my confusion begins. Bitcoin and XMR were both intended as digital currencies, and for some thing to be a good currency (beyond acceptability which is increasing for both BTC and XMR alike), there must be a stability in its value. This stability is at present absent, and most all Crypto Currencies are viewed as investments, and I struggle to see why the prices of BTC and XMR must rationally continually increase? Is it due to only ever increasing adoption, for unlike ETH and others they (BTC and XMR) do not have additional utility through DApps and the like such that in the future these would only match inflation (if Fiat is still as powerful) or otherwise be stagnant so as to be hedge against the ills of government (more so in the case of XMR than BTC)? Or is it there something more like maybe the scarcity of XMR as people want to conduct private transactions in ever increasing amounts that would continually cause XMR to appreciate.\n\nEffectively, I'm not sure whether XMR is an investment or not. To my present understanding, it is in its ultimate form is what a checking account might have been today had the Gold Standard been not been abandoned or any shenanigans performed therein. So a great product but one does not expect great returns from one's checking account.\n\nI am grateful for your taking the time to read this post, and any thoughts you might share.\n\nWishing you a pleasant day/night.",

What will the future hold? The war situation will educate many and confuse others about the potential of crypto \n\nEveryone first hears of btc, then maybe they learn of the host of issues including the censorship that you mentioned and xmr solves most of them. For me it is a logical decision to hold a chunk of xmr.\n\nMany tokens have inflation as well, btc and xmr are capped and the future will increase scarcity. Basic supply and demand. You are guessing at demand and also manipulation in the markets.",

AML implementations don't tend to be public/open source, which adds to the unpredictability of the situation.\n\nTo see whether a particular Bitcoin is considered tainted or not, you need to consider \"by whom?\" - which becomes especially clear in situations with 2 or more sides like a war, where both sides might consider the other side \"tainted\".",

This is just one example. Today Coinbase blocks over 25,000 addresses related to Russian individuals or entities ... \n\nIt is trivial to frame someone with this kind of blockchain surveillance (BS). It also raises an interesting question: Are the BS companies subject to the sanctions also? Can they provide services to the Russian government?\n\nLet us not forget that both sides can engage in this kind of BS. Consider the following scenario:\n\n**Gulag, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag, by BS**\n\n Let us say that Alex, who lives in Russia accepts Bitcoin. James, who lives outside of Russia, hates Alex and wants to cause Alex pain. James crafts the following Bitcoin transaction with two outputs:\n\n1) One output to the address for the Ukrainian military\n\n2) A second output to Alex\n\nTo the Russian BS provider this looks like Alex made a donation to the Ukrainian military. \n\nI am a baby boomer and remember the first cold war very well. I never thought one could send innocent people to the Gulag, by tricking the KGB **from outside the Soviet Union**. One must keep in mind that Vladimir Putin is a former KGB operative.",

Github (Microsoft, US) given ultimatum to remove Monero project & removes it\n5. Any atomic swap providers (domains) will keep popping up, and be brought down on government seizures\n6. More Darknet market seizures and clever government bots running Tor exit nodes\n7. All western/Asian/Chinese/Russian countries get together to place an outright ban on privacy coin activity\n8. Anyone found to deal with Monero, or any source of money trailed out from Monero (e.g. Monero -> Bitcoin) will be tracked. When such Bitcoin enters a KYC exchange to be cashed out - will be frozen without reasons.\n9. Any post promoting Monero on social media; their (twitter) accounts banned - or provided up to 3 warnings, before their account is taken down.\n10. The only cash on-ramp would be via CBDCs. And direct purchase of Monero would be tracked and blocked - as much as possible. All different countries' CBDCs will be interoperable via cross-blockchain to better collaborate/track-n-trace citizen activities.\n\nThese are the possible worse case scenario that I could see happening.

For example:\n\n>The United States should ensure that safeguards are in place and promote the responsible development of digital assets to protect consumers, investors, and businesses; maintain privacy; and shield against arbitrary or unlawful surveillance, which can contribute to human rights abuses.\n\nIt's a \"have your cake and eat it too\" mentality. As we know here, you can have privacy for all or privacy for none, and no in between. Cryptography cannot pick and choose which transactions to make traceable based on some moral or legal standard.\n\nAlso, the text refers to \"obscured blockchain ledgers\", which sounds like another way to describe privacy coins:\n\n>Growth in decentralized financial ecosystems, peer-to-peer payment activity, and obscured blockchain ledgers without controls to mitigate illicit finance could also present additional market and national security risks in the future.  The United States must ensure appropriate controls and accountability for current and future digital assets systems to promote high standards for transparency, privacy, and security \u2014 including through regulatory, governance, and technological measures \u2014 that counter illicit activities and preserve or enhance the efficacy of our national security tools.",

Just my life experience.\n\nIf they 'ban' crypto's and service providers that do not adhere to AML/KYC/CTF what does that look like in real life? Do they go after 1 or 2 people? Put it in the newspapers and give themselves a pat on the back? A bit like the Drug War?\n\nThis is point #1 they know they can't stop it. The people using these things, already know what they are doing. And why. You will see a drop of usage with the threat of imprisonment and other things like fines or taking assets but it won't kill the space and they know it.\n\nPoint #2 is that both sides of the party left and right all want to leave routes open for themselves. You don't think the rich and powerful use cash, gold, art, wine and anonymous cryptocurrencies to do the things that they do such as evade tax and launder money? C'mon now.\n\nWhat I think they WILL do.\n\nOnce they introduce these things, in whatever manner that they do it; FED Coin, digital dollar, cbdc, whatever. I think they will purposely make it easy to transfer from crypto into their version of it, they may even offer tax incentives. I'm in Australia and currently, they tax crypto as capital gains, if they said OK, no more capital gains on crypto, but you have 2 years to xfer your crypto into our version of it, tax-free, they will not only grow usage of their new currency but they will suck up so much data it'll be unbelievable.\n\nAnd in that data will be a privacy token wallet or address that is an anonymous one. And that is when they knock on the door and demand to see what you have done with it, sucking up more data, creating more connections.\n\nThey will use this as a kind of honey pot to build their own knowledge on what is going on underground in my opinion. What they do with that is what they have always done. They will pick and choose who they go after. They will negotiate deals and get the odd criminal here and there.\n\nThey will not ban its use because they know that won't work and will instead push use further underground but instead, they will simply look for usage of these things and then come door-knocking for data.\n\nAs a side note, of course, they will use their cbdc or whatever they call it and the rules behind it to build upon their social credit system and of course, if you are caught with these things you will be put onto their naughty list. These things are a given. Its already happening, in Canada, Russia etc.\n\nJust my opinion.",

How Bitcoin is just a tool, and in trying to separate our financial system from the old one, Monero is a really good tool for that also.\n* They started accepting Monero payments for the conference, and found that Monero made up 65% of payments - vs Bitcoin and debit/credit cards\n* They talk about how Monero provides \"out of the box\" privacy for everyone.\n* Peter (host) notes how he's non-technical and would find achieving privacy on Bitcoin very hard, as \"just one mistake\" could ruin it. Later he says he'd use Monero if he wanted to make a private transaction.\n* Peter mentions the risk of a non-detectable inflation bug in Monero. Ragnar isn't aware of this risk, and says (inaccurately) that he thinks there's some way to check. Yes, you can check the total amount of Monero minted, but no, you can't check if there's an inflation bug. You would only (potentially) be able to spot a flaw in the code that allows for this.\n* Ragnar says that Bitcoin maximalism is non-rational. That it was a rational reaction against ICO season... but ultimately isn't a rational viewpoint.\n* Ragnar suggests that if you accept Bitcoin (or any crypto really) isn't \"sound money\", due to its volatility, and instead you look to another of its purposes as \"cypherpunk money\" - which is decentralized, peer to peer, and able to route around centralized systems. Then Monero fits that definition well.",

Like Dash instantly saying they're not a privacy coin just to not be delisted.\n\nI just think people should put more attention to this, and consider talking about it when presenting monero or comparing it with other projects.\n\nEthereum for example has changed their monetary policy a few times already, and with PoS it will change again. You could argue that there is \"consensus\" on this but realistically speaking if the US and EU governments pressured their developers and Vitalik to change the monetary policy (maybe even behind doors) or get banned, I think they would manufacture consensus to appease governments. Of course I'm speculating but I think it's not that far from reality, and this talking about a project the size of Ethereum... One can imagine how it would be for smaller projects.\n\nWith Monero we know that this wouldn't happen.",

There is ECC math and Keccak hashing involved.\n\nThe usual way to do it is to choose any programming language that has bindings to the Monero wallet RCP server, the binary called `monero-wallet-rpc`, and work with that. You can create a new wallet with a single call, and then query the resulting address with just one more. You don't necessarily need your own Monero node, a so-called \"remote node\" will do.",

AFAICT it is the antonym of the cypherpunk ideals and literally makes me sick to see how those ideals have been twisted into a centralized scam system from a decentralized privacy enhancing economic freedom goal.\n\nBillions are being washed from scamcoin launches on every centralized exchange continuously for years and if they want to wash those IL-gotten gains in monero then they should be footing the bill.\n\nWhy have you not proposed this to them? I don't want to see this becoming a precedent for all the shitcoins in the world to be getting the monero eco system to pay for their protection.",

Yes, I think you have a great point re. the scamcoins, etc.\n\nHowever, there's a lot more to this than just that negative aspect.  A big potential problem for XMR right now is the threat of delisting from major exchanges.  We've already lost Kraken UK.  Losing the rest of Kraken would be a major blow.  We need alternatives, and atomic swaps appear (to me) to be the best option.\n\nSo what does that specifically have to do with ETH in particular?  Well, there are still a large number of global users who might be interested in XMR, but who currently only have limited experience in the two biggest cryptos, BTC and ETH.  And there are still exchanges that are very limited.  Shakepay is one of the largest Canadian exchanges and currently only supports BTC and ETH.  There are lots of people around the world that only have ETH.  Think of the millions of people who are still GPU mining ETH.  A lot of them may have an interest in XMR.  In fact, some might not want to move through a CEX like Kraken even if they could, because they want to convert those mined ETH directly to XMR.\n\nAccessibility is everything.  Even if you don't support a particular type of crypto, that doesn't mean you should try to \"ban\" transactions involving that.  Banning something means censorship, and this sub should be all about protecting privacy and eliminating censorship.\n\nIf nothing else, think about this.  You like XMR.  You don't like ETH.  This atomic swap will let a person convert ETH into XMR.  Other people may feel the same way that you do.  This will help them get rid of their dirty dirty ETH and turn it into our favorite asset.",

BCH has no devtax.\n\nBCH solved its developer funding challenge by creating [Flipstarter](https://flipstarter.cash/), a noncustodial, self-hosted, permissionless crowdfunding system that funds projects with special types of on-chain transactions.\n\nUnder [certain versions of the Seraphis protocol](https://github.com/monero-project/research-lab/issues/91#issuecomment-967768995), Flipstarter-like collaborative fundraising will also be possible for Monero on its chain.\n\nAnyway, if someone stepped forward with a feasible plan to implement BCH<>XMR atomic swaps, then a joint CCS/Flipstarter fundraising campaign could supplement the bounty award.",

I won't rule out trying to get funding from the ethereum side, but I just wanted to give my point of view on it.",

Monero doesn't (yet) need it and will handle it better in terms of privacy, of course.\n\nSo, the future is uncertain, but Monero works as promised at the moment. That's more than can be said for just about everything else.

Most people are here to get rich quickly as they did with Tesla stonks. There are the people who have led to crypto being treated as securities and NPC-like chanting things like \"just pay your taxes\" and \"KYC/AML isn't that big of a deal, I did the same thing for my bank account.\" Even within crypto enthusiasts, I hear some of this creep in, and people who have more at stake than I ever had to wager show a face of shock when I say things like \"Bitcoin\" is not a viable currency (meaning BTC of course).\n\nA friend of mine gave, what I believe to be, a fantastic talk on the topic a few years ago and followed up at the end of the year with a 2.0 version. It's worth a watch if you have some time.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/lOinyikpaZI",

I would argue Bitcoin overpaid for security earlier in is existence and even more-so did Ethereum.  Ethereum has been able to make changes, though their was a lot of miner pushback. For Bitcoin, even though they would likely greatly benefit from a tail emission, it is unlikely to ever occur until after disaster strikes since miner incentives do not correlate with network incentives.\n\n2. To my understanding, the dynamic nature of Monero\u2019s blocksize is not without limits.  There is a maximum sustainable block-size, I would think there has to be.  Otherwise, blockchain bloat will increase exponentially and even worse, at a certain size limit, latency issues will become a concern.",

Nobody would have an incentive to give your transaction priority if they weren't seeing the money.\n\nAny variability in fees leaks tracing information, so the obvious solution to excessive fees is to entirely eliminate variability, and force all transactions to use exactly the same fee (per byte), fixed by the protocol. Deflation is probably bad, whereas uniformity is definitely good.\n\nYou could set a target hashrate and have the fee slowly auto-adjust to maintain it. That would probably mean time stamping transactions as well as blocks, so that the consensus algorithm could keep miners from \"postdating\" blocks to make the hash rate look low. For example, you could reject any block whose timestamp was too much later than the average(?) timestamp of the transactions in that block. I think the only way to get around that would be to spam block after block with with fake transactions, thus freezing out the real transactions whose fees you were trying to collect in the first place.",

The monero mining network is *so diverse* that I find the \"diminishing returns\" part a bit perplexing. It's not like we're funneling money into asic companies. These are real people contributing their CPU cycles to the network, not some industrial titan. Of course, I'm a miner (and you should be too), so I'm a bit biased. \n\nbut yeah. If there's a cap on fees earned per block, miners just won't add transactions to the block that go past this cap. This will clog the network because blocks won't grow. Miners are incentivized to create small blocks in general (lower chance of orphaning), so either this is a bad idea or its an idea that needs more polishing. \n\nand monero is money. It's meant to move around. Burning fees, by definition, decreases money velocity.",

If the end result of all this is that we get a Monero Only focused app, that will continue to integrate developments in the monero ecosystem (ie atomic swaps), then I\u2019m personally a happy Monero Maxi that can continue to genuinely promote Cake (on MoneroTalk) as the best Monero smartphone wallet.

You\u2019ve grown to be a respected entity in said communities. Please deeply consider what putting your name on a ZEC project would mean. \n\nI\u2019ve been an user for years, and Cake Wallet is the wallet I always recommend to people\u2014especially those who are new to XMR and may be intimidated by the official GUI wallet. \n\nIt means a lot to have developers that genuinely care about the community they\u2019ve built. Far too often founders create a great app and then immediately sell it off or ruin it by trying to hyper-monetize it. \n\nThank you for listening and thank you for sticking to your mission statement.",

We just have to get better at detecting and shutting down their psyops campaign style tactics.  And learn how to vet code, I guess...because that's the final line of defense.",

The first tool is exceptional government access to transactional data written on non-transparent ledgers, obfuscated by advanced anonymization cryptography. The tool should be optional for networks as long as another effective AML/CFT measures are accessible for the intermediaries or for the government in relation to a given network. If these other measures are not available and the network does not grant exceptional access, the regulations should allow governments to ***combat the development of those networks***. Effective tools in that scope should target the value of privacy-cryptocurrency, not its users. ***Such tools could include, as a tool of last resort, state attacks which would undermine the trust of the community in a specific network.***\n\nSince the Monero Project cannot and will not create a \"back door\" for government surveillance, governments may be employing this \"tool of last resort\" against the Monero community. It appears that the author of the article is a professor of law in Poland, but it may be the case that their view is widespread among Monero's adversaries.\n\nScaring away new developers is one way to weaken Monero. Stay vigilant and fully engage your critical thinking capabilities.",

Below I have tried to summarize the difference between CCS vs. bounty.\n\nDo you already know how the [Community Crowdfunding System (CCS)](https://ccs.getmonero.org/) works? If not then please read [what is the CCS](https://ccs.getmonero.org/what-is-ccs/) and [How to submit a CCS\n](https://ccs.getmonero.org/how-to-ccs/) and have a look through the active and old CCS\u2019s.\n\nUsually the CCS has several milestones. When you reach a milestones you will get the calculated payout. You need to create and submit the CCS by yourself (I think).\n\nIt seems that the community is very enthusiastic about your project , so I am sure that it will get funded.\n\nCreating a [bounty](https://bounties.monero.social/) on the other hand is very simple. Just sign in with an email and submit your idea. Done. We will make a post about it on r/Monero and ask the community to support it with donations. When you fulfill the task you will receive the bounty.\n\nThe bounty can be created by you or another person. I would be happy to do it, but honestly I am lacking the knowledge with the correct specification for the xmr-eth atomic swap protocol. If you don\u2019t want to do it, I can ask one of the XMR contributors for help.\n\nKeep in mind that a bounty does not get as much attention as a CCS does and the funding will be much lower. Usually bounties are for small jobs. The atomic swap protocol is a big task which should be funded with a CCS imo.\n\nDid you decide if you work in a team and split the task or is someone alone doing it?",

Only the one who knows s_a & s_b can spend it, which is only knowable by Alice, and is revealed to her after Bob claims the ETH.\n\nThis is my quick reading of it.

The spend key in his possession isn't the full spend key needed to spend the Monero after step 2. The full spend key needed to spend the Monero is the combination of the spend key in Alice's possession + the spend key Bob reveals in order to claim the ETH.\n\nI believe after step 2, the Monero is in no-man's land. If Bob doesn't claim the ETH, it looks like his Monero is lost forever. Bob has to claim the ETH in order to then reveal the half of the spend key to Alice, who can then combine it with her half to claim the Monero.\n\nKeep note that the race conditions are tricky here, but it looks well thought out.\n\nEDIT:\n\n> can they create a public key that takes in a pair of spend and view keys to be used (one from Alice and one from Bob), so Bob couldn't spend his XMR even if he wanted to unless he had Alice's spend key as well? \n\nBasically, yea this is what looks like is happening in the protocol. ~~Not multisig, little different~~ (EDIT2: actually I believe it technically is multisig, you were right on that analogy)",

Yes, the market cap is somewhat small, but the Nano community is a very friendly bunch and they genuinely want to use Nano for real-world commerce, which is more than I can say for a lot of other coins.\n\nI like Nano too, but my experience has also been that Nano fans often underestimate just how exposed their activities are. The Nano ecosystem (e.g. popular wallets) mostly assumes people will constantly reuse a single address, so it's typically even worse for privacy than Bitcoin variants.",

I'm a bit of a gold-bug and generally think crypto is short-sighted, ill-informed, shallow and some sort of a ponzi wrapped up into a misleading pyramid scheme supported by \\[un\\]stable coins & leverage.\n\nMonero I really think is in a whole league of it's own and i'm not saying this cause it's my favourite coin of the week. It's characteristics are perfectly timed for the authoritarian governments on the rise in the developed world and existing struggling world, money needs to be anonymous, it needs to have a great stock-to-flow yet have an increasing supply of units, this is powered by random guys in a basement and cannot be sued as there is no legal corporate entity, cheap to use, straight forward, pretty fast, (+) if hackers, private bankers, guys who are into investing (Kiyosaki advocating for Monero's tech without saying as such, doug casey & his associate, EB Tucker, etc.), used on DKN markets + anecdotally some hedgies I've spoken to, if all of them either use or agree with Monero vs. all the other cumdogerocketdot coins... then it's good enough for me! Look man if you're gonna hack Saudi Aramco, who just have like their own SEALs contracted as hitman... you best be sure you're not gonna get caught & if they use Monero then Boom. I'm not advocating for hacking or crime, but just merely pointing out it's efficiency for Everyone.   \n\n\nLitecoin has (before MW) all the issues that are so common with Bitcoin but it's actively trying to be USED, so I appreciate that. Dash is for soy boys but again, it's used a fair amount which is a good sign. So I think it, a long with some others, it will hang around... but all these others hahaha man I don't think yield will be a conversation in a few years the question is \"I only lost \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_...\" \n\nXMR is going higher for sure but payment systems should be pretty stable (like gold). But dude if you're the only one with XMR... than you're laughing! Because the technology and what it offers, all these have addresses and so forth but XMR as a rare way to transmit cryptographically in an untraceable, private manner for a good/service of your choice...(basically the ultimate free-market tool) than people will naturally seek this out whether Ethereum (or anything) exists or not lol \n\nI'm of the belief that 2 things are happening with this so-called crypto market... 1 is that this DeFi collateral shit is a PsyOp to distract people from creating a sound currency or means of exchange to replace fiat (instead, have them gamble for profits like coked up apes). AND I think the constant talk of cryptocurrency is a way to habituate minds into accepting a digital currency easier in the future AKA FedCoin. \n\nGRIN can be a pain in the dick with both users having to be online at the same time, but that might be something else to consider if they fill some privacy holes. \n\nYea I think we should all hold tight, i'm bearish for the Western economies in the future and when people are monitored in Chinada, USSA or (not so) Great Britain... 'It's showtime'\n\nReply if you disagree!! and DM me if you want some XMR stickers, i can mail them to you (I have too many hanging around here haha).",

Although not on-par with XMR privacy, it would be good to have swaps available with a more fungible coin than BTC via another coin with protocol level anonymity (as opposed to BTC which requires the use of mixers such as Samouri wallet which are expensive to use for small amounts).\n\nAlso, I think this should be a project for the future and not the present.

The \"fear\" aspect is due to the coercive power of the State. They can either comply, or leave the country. If they are  not registered in a country but they want the people there, they have to offer KYC so that their users would have access to banks and other money exchanges. Just look at Binance UK. The people there could still access Binance, but they cannot connect to Binance using their banks or their local credit cards.\n\nWill the SEC go  after ETH? That's a good question. \n\nUnited States SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has studied cryptocurrency and knows more about what it is and how it behaves, better than most people. He will use the Howey test. For him, if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it probably is a duck. He calls it the \"duck test.\" \n\nUsing the tests, you could see that when ETH was presold, it can actually be considered a security. So that means that the SEC can go after the pre-mined ETH. \n\nHowever, with regard to the ETH that was mined, these are not securities at all, so the SEC has no jurisdiction over these. Furthermore, if I remember correctly, Gensler considered ETH akin to a commodity because of gas. A commodity cannot be considered a security. It goes against the very concept of a security. The ETH that is staked for ETH2.0 also cannot be considered a security because it doesn't behave like a security.",

Especially because from the outside it looked like he was corrupted by the man because of his KYC implementation etc.\n\nAnother thing to consider: The etherinos seem to be organizing to push for better crypto laws proactively   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81zAuBk8ao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81zAuBk8ao)  Who knows what comes out of it. Defi is just another step in the warfare between the people and the government. The fight is ultimately about this: Will the government and their cronies still be able to steal from us through controlling the money supply or not.\n\nWe should think strategically about what the role of monero is in this battle. The thing is: at the moment its pretty easy to ban it because the narrative goes like this: money laundry, dark net, tax evasion, terrorism bad. The only reason we are not banned is because monero is still under the radar and the focus is on Bitcoin and soon eth.\n\nSooner or later both of these might fall. And we should prepare for this. We need to switch the narrative. We need to show that monero is a chance for the unbanked in the third world to participate in the digital economy by selling their digital goods for monero.\n\nWe need to frame the people that defend AML regulations and KYC as old white men that defend their privilege. We need to call them out for the racists that they are. And if their life gets destroyed by it, so be it.\n\nThe libertarian values stand in contrast to that. But we are not at oxford union debating about this in a polite manner. WE ARE AT WAR! Make no mistake: the government is not going give up its power to print money and steal from the plebs without a fight! And we need to fight this fight by all means. We will not win by being nice and reasonable.",

You can even run your own private blockchain with a few of your friends and password protect it - no one else will be able to connect to it. Of course there will be the \"official\" P2Pool blockchain just because it will have a default configuration.",

I thought Monero has a very short block time, so p2pool is probably for very large miners only, as it would have a very high starting difficulty.\n\nTo check this, I just set up a p2pool node and saw that the pool block time is set to 10s, sidechain difficulty \\~400M, meaning the pool is running at \\~40MH/s. As I have guessed, it makes smaller participants harder to join because 400M is a very large difficulty for several tens of KH/s to generate valid shares. The larger the pool becomes, the higher the difficulty would be.\n\nLowering the block time might help to lower difficulty, but it's not necessary though, and it may introduce other problems like too frequent job switching.\n\nLet's see if we can improve it..",

You've said elsewhere in the thread that there wouldn't be a way to block addresses from using p2pool (which is the whole point), so if they were smart they'd *only* mine this way. Currently pool operators would block specific addresses from mining to their pool when they're identified as cryptojacking, so *why wouldn't* the botters use p2pool.",

I am quite sceptical, I must say.\n\nI compare this with a subreddit that was started about 2 months ago. Purported problem: No subreddit yet that is fully dedicated to Monero beginners, a place on Reddit for people who are at the very start of their personal journey into Monero. Proposed solution: /r/Monero_Beginners , in case that wasn't obvious yet from the way I set up things here.\n\nDid it become part of any solution? Well, it certainly does not look like that. You may check yourself: It's a ghost town.\n\nAnd if you ask me it should be quite obvious: If you are a Monero beginner you may have quite a number of problems, but lack of a dedicated subreddit for you as a beginner is not among them IMHO.\n\nFrom all this I can't derive what is a good course of action for you to help people making money from explicit material using a solid cryptocurrency instead of one that is quite crappy for the purpose at hand, but please: Don't waste your time getting a new subreddit to fly.",

BCH might be the most cost effective out of all the swaps I could think of (using a smart contract) \n\nI took a look at secret network. The thing is it is a bit more like how wrapped bitcoin works than it being a proper swap. They lock the xmr into a multisig once it is locked they create the same amount of sXmr inside the secret network. Then a special burn of sXmr can be made that releases the multisig. It is interesting and I might look at the details on how it handles the actual xmr portion since it might be the more challenging part for me to do in code.",

The miner will only be incentivized to make a larger block if the profit from more transactions becomes greater than the penalty fee of making a bigger block. So Monero scales as much as Moore\u2019s law continues and storage for the blockchain continues to scale up, and if the blockchain becomes to big for most people they can mine with a pruned version of the chain and don\u2019t need the older part of the chain to mine. This a problem for all blockchains tho ofcourse, it\u2019s just that Monero transactions are a little bigger because they contains many decoy signatures for fungibility.\n\nMy question is why pruning requires a decent chunk of the chain still, why not just keep a very small piece of the pruned end of the chain if you really wanted to?",

Also 2nd layer implementations have been loosely discussed in the past.\n\nHowever, as of today it's not a focus, since the network hardly hits the 300kB \"soft\" block limit, which will activate the current onchain scaling implementation which is based on penalties applied to miners who increase block size over the median of last X blocks, so incentives are to keep it small unless there are enough \"important\" transactions to be included paying a reasonable fee. Once median block size raised, miners don't have to pay any penalty when including even low fee transactions, but unused block size lowers the median (at maximum to 300kB) again.\n\nAs a node owner and from observations I would assume we can easily scale at least x100 from here, what would mean \\~3M transactions a day without any further optimisations / code changes which would be more than x10 of BTC. Sure, blockchain growth would be at \\~5GB a day, but a node can easily prune about 80% of it and in times of streaming over Netflix eg. what is 5GB of data transfer? You also should think about that we have SSD drives below 100$ per TB and HDD even below 20$ per TB which would allow you to store almost a year of full blockchain data without even pruning.\n\nI would say we need to focus harder on scaling when we see transaction counts of Bitcoin, as of today I would rather focus on optimising privacy and also kind of scaling when making transactions smaller and/or easier to verify. Just remember, before Bulletproofs kicked in, transaction size was roughly x10, also verification time about the same and with RingCT it wasn't possible to create a transaction below 13kB.",

In a physical scenario, you can just use different accounts for every cahs register and use view wallet.\n\nFor protection, there is escrow. Not sure how good they are at the moment but if crypto is adopted more PayPal will adopt being an escrow. It'll be up to the website though to use/allow escrows so there's more of a playing field. Plus escrow increases costs which in turn increases prices, so double edged sword. Remember monero is hard cash so an escrow is turning a debit transaction into an credit one which is annoying for sellers. Even more so if their costs are in fiat. Then they have to wait like normal but also spend time converting to fiat. If you don't trust a website with your money, why do you trust them with your shipping information? Do you think scamming you would be the only way to make money off of you? They can sell your data and you wouldn't know. Don't shop at stores that don't have a proper certificate for their website.",

On the other hand a token that is a \"covered security\" on the Ethereum blockchain can lead to issues particularly if an Exchange is using customer funds to stake Ethereum.\n\nEdit: \"Covered securities\" is much broader than the SEC / Howey Test definition of securities.

The definition appears to be completely different than a typical definition of security used by the SEC (as far as I understand).\n\nThat said, the \"account\" wording is worth looking into. I would imagine that in none of the cases people are terrified of would users have an account relationship with the \"broker.\"\n\nhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6045",

The coin\\token would basically be put in a custodial wallet or locked in a smart contract if possible and then another token would be created that refers to a original coin/token on the privacy chain that would then be exchanged in place of the actual token. When you unwrap it you would destroy the coin / token on the privacy chain and  the original token that it referred to would then be sent to the address of the individual who \"unwrapped\" the token. I don't know how it would be done in the case of every token. But I would expect in the case of Bitcoin you would leverage something like hashlock. Where the required hash would actually be encoded in the wrapped token.\n\nThe concept would be similar to ethereum's WBTC(Wrapped Bitcoin), but the transactions would be held in a privacy oriented ledger and would not be transferred back to the original coin/tokens ledger.\nSo while I use the term wrapped it's more of a proxy token or coin to be used in place of the original coin but can be redeemed at any time for the locked up coin or token that it represents.\n \nAs far as secret monero yes I am referring to the secret Network. And in terms of defi the secret Network it's supposed to offer decentralized finance. And it's not really a requirement of setting up some sort of privacy chain to allow for anonymous transactions with other coins that have higher valuation.",

A DEX will allow you to exchange coins without neededing a currency exchange like Kraken or Binance, it doesn't need Know Your Customer (KYC), and banning it would be nigh impossible short of turning off the internet. Its base currency is in Monero.\n\nAtomic swaps are also in development. From what I've read, it's currently possible to perform a trustless swap from Bitcoin into Monero, but not the other way around. There's most likely going to be a hard fork in the near future that will address this issue and make going both ways possible. \n\nThen there's the Ethereum privacy thing... Are you talking about Rollups? I'm still a bit hazy on Rollups, and I've got much respect for ETH, but Monero doesn't need that for privacy. All transactions are private by default using Monero. Monero accomplishes this using various cryptographic methods which are well worth reading about.\n\nAnyways, while some of this is in various phases of development, I can see converting BTC->XMR using an atomic swap, trading on Haveno, and going XMR->BTC via atomic swap if you really needed to for some reason. Because Monero is private by default, you'd get that privacy layer you're talking about. Monero has transaction fees of course, but they're very very low.\n\nAnyway, I hope I understood you correctly,  and I think what you're talking about is not only possible but in development.",

Monero proponents will say this is \u201coptional privacy\u201d as you have to move coins into the Rollup contract to get privacy, this is akin to Zcash where only some of the transactions are private, if you opt in, but most transactions are public by default. \n\nI would argue that against this sentiment by saying that\n\n1. If smart contracts find many uses and Ethereum ends up hosting much critical infrastructure, this \u201coptional privacy\u201d maybe be good enough for the large majority of use cases and would be a worthy trade off for folks who want to stay within the Ethereum ecosystem as that\u2019s where everything else lives. \n\n2.

There is also a need for a short term burst capability to deal with seasonal variation in retail transaction demand. \n\nBy the way Monero scales way better today than Diner's Club did in 1950 or American Express or BankAmericard (the precursor to VISA) did in 1960. Consider for example storing the current Monero blockchain on punched cards. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card#/media/File:IBM_card_storage.NARA.jpg. By the way the Wikipedia note got one thing wrong The storage capacity of a Warehouse Full of Punched Cards (WFPC) is about 0.4 GB not 4 GB because of the limitations of the tabulating machines of the day.

If people want privacy to be the default, wallets will make it the default, and the default of the actual underlying technology won't matter that much.\n\nI think you might be right.  Ethereum is pretty strong, in a large part because it has more utility (due to its broad smart contract powers and flexible ERC-20 tokens) than most other coins, including Bitcoin and Monero.\n\nNot to suggest Monero is likely to fall to Ethereum.  Monero has a strong, growing community, and I think people who are really serious about privacy will prefer a technology with strong privacy built into its core ethos.  But yeah, Ethereum could indeed be big competition, if the technology you mention can provide sufficiently strong privacy.\n\nI never saw Zcash as a terribly strong competitor to Monero.  Unlike Ethereum, it has no special draw to drive adoption.  It's basically just another mundane cryptocurrency that happens to have a privacy option.  Monero has privacy as its core ethos, rather than as a side note add on.  Also, Monero's high security default privacy means that it is more stable, because crypto gamblers can't just watch the markets for massive purchases and dumps.  That stability makes it more suitable as an everyday currency.  Currencies like Zcash (and Ethereum, for that matter) aren't very suitable for everyday spending, because their value can change quite dramatically in the time it takes to fill your cart at Walmart.\n\nThis is an aspect of privacy that is not terribly well understood but that has a massive impact on the suitability of cryptocurrencies for particular use cases.  The last thing anyone wants is for the value of their money to drop significantly while they are shopping, only to be surprised by a much higher price than expected when they get to the register.  And this volatility makes transparency coins far less useful for everyday consumer use than privacy coins that are affected far less dramatically by trading market forces.",

I think its a desire for smart contracts to be the killer app of crypto for some reason or another, but money being the killer app fills a void in our current civilization. There is one thing in our world in which a lack of arbitration makes the most sense - and that is money. Money just needs to be money. It needs to be consistent, universal, fungible, permissionless, and free (as in, no human can affect what happens). Never before in the entire history of our civilization have we had the ability to actually create this kind of money. Now we have. Period. \n\nAnything else probably does better with a human hand somewhere. If we had \"smart\" contracts running the world, it would be a very dangerous, cold, inhumane place. \n\nso I ultimately see \"smart\" contracts coming into place where there's some human hand that can tip the scales somewhere (hello oracles), and if thats the end game, then its just the existing system gussied up with some fancy, bloated bells and whistles. \n\nbut, yah know, machine learning is mistaken for artificial intelligence, so ...",

Ethereum is a smart contract, decentralized app platform with its own currency called *ether*, that is commonly referred as *gas* as it fuels the transactions inside this platform.\n\nMeanwhile Monero is a money network, whose goal is to provide sound money properties above everything else so people can freely transact between themselves. It doesn't try to do anything else than that, because being sound money is already extremely hard to simply accept extra trade-offs by adding functionalities, that's why you have Ethereum and other smart chains that can do a gazillion things (and also includes a gazillion bugs).\n\nI swear to God when people compare Ethereum to Monero or even Bitcoin I feel like they're comparing how McDonald's will be Pfizer's biggest competitor.\n\nPeople on this market compare Ethereum to Bitcoin and other currencies relating to price.

Evidently Target's prediction system use for targeted advertising once started sending a pregnant teen ads for baby products.  The catch is, *even she didn't know she was pregnant*.  Her spending behavior changed slightly, probably due to hormones, and Target's system had noticed that the particular change was normally followed with buying infant care products in other people.  Transparency coins allow *anyone* to do that kind of analysis on *anyone*.  So nosy in-laws could get the news before you do.  Maybe spending habits could reveal that a person is looking for a new job, and an employer could use that information to threaten the employee or preemptively fire the employee, to coerce loyalty from other employees.  And do you really want *anyone* who wants to to know every time you buy condoms, laxatives, or other generally private and embarrassing products?  There is also a concern with medical privacy.  Maybe you don't want people knowing you are regularly visiting a urologist, a sex therapist, or getting chemo.  Some things are *just private*, and privacy is a *good default*.\n\nSo it's not even that every single person has something to hide from law enforcement or the government.  Most probably don't.

                                                    "response": "Not just that.  The big thing that can save Monero from government bans is atomic swaps.  It's far to difficult for governments to enforce bans on individuals, so they would target exchanges.  As long as you can still buy Bitcoin on exchanges, you can buy Bitcoin and then use atomic swaps to trade for Monero without using an exchange.  And if Bitcoin is banned, you can use atomic trades with *other coins* to get Bitcoin, to trade for Monero.  I'm not sure how many coins have atomic trades with Bitcoin, but if even *one* of those coins can be bought on exchanges, you can trade it for Bitcoin and then trade that for *any other*, including Monero.  (Also, there is always the potential for one-on-one in-person trades of Monero for cash, goods, or whatever.)\n\nNote that Bitcoin and most other crypto coins are also anonymous (but not *private*).  Monero's privacy, however, is certainly helpful here.  If government law enforcement figures out your Bitcoin address, they can track all past and future transactions.  This would allow them to rack up a list of charges against you.  If they managed to link a Monero address to you, that's only valid for one transaction, which they will only know the amount of if they are the other party.  This means a maximum of *one charge*, and if your transactions are typically fairly small (everyday stuff), they are unlikely to go after you, because they won't get much out of it.  And of course, the privacy means it would be significantly harder to track the address to you in the first place.\n\nThe decentralization is an advantage too.  It would be easier to shut down Bitcoin ASIC mining than Monero mining, mainly because ASICs centralize a huge amount of computing power, so shutting down a handful of operations could seriously compromise the network.  Shutting down the same number of Monero \"operations\" would have no impact at all, because it's pretty much 100% individuals, each contributing only a tiny bit of mining on CPUs.  It would cost far more than it was worth to shut down much Monero mining.\n\nThe big thing though is keeping Monero useful.  What kills cryptocurrencies is losing their utility (or not having any utility in the first place).  If governments can make Monero less useful, perhaps by scaring individuals and businesses into refusing to deal it in, it will hurt Monero.  If, however, governments do things that substantially *increase* the perceived value and utility of Monero, it will thrive.  And right now, a *lot* of governments are undermining the trust of their citizens in them, which is decreasing trust in their domestic fiat currencies.  It is very possible that in our current situation, if governments start trying to ban Monero or crypto in general, that will lead to *massive* demand for the most private crypto people can find (which is Monero), and yeah, if a ton of people own significant amounts of Monero, it will be literally impossible to kill, because so many people will have a literal vested interest in its survival.\n\nAt this point, I think the U.S. is going in the right direction with crypto.  It is treating crypto income as taxable income that must be reported.  Monero is no harder to enforce reporting of than cash, and if Monero is on exchanges, the government can require exchanges to report profits from trades.  So *the* best strategy for governments would be to extend taxation to crypto earnings and dividends, so that they can continue getting their share, and strongly encourage exchanges to carry all cryptocurrencies that have significant popularity.  If they try to ban crypto, it will likely fail to have a significant effect, *and* it will ensure that people *don't* report crypto earnings, since they will get in trouble *if they do*.",

                            "response": "So here's the thing with *true* privacy coins: They are less volatile than transparency coins.  This is because with transparency coins, coin traders can see large purchases and sales, which they can use to predict changes in value.  So, someone buys lots of Bitcoin, that indicates high trust, and other traders follow suit, riding the wave of increasing value that comes with increasing trust.  When someone sells lots of Bitcoin, the inverse happens.  Traders lose trust and try to sell before the value drops too much.  This effect significantly amplifies the impact of any significant transaction, creating high volatility.\n\nThis *can't happen* with Monero.  Its privacy means that traders can't see large transactions to react to.  This means that most short term traders aren't that interested in it, because they can't predict changes in value very well.  It *also* means that Monero is significantly more stable than transparency coins though, making it more practical for *real life* use, like buying and selling things.  Anyhow, what this all means is that Monero will change in value more slowly, and it won't be subject to the booms and busts transparency coins are constantly vulnerable to.\n\nThis does mean it will deflate (increase in value) significantly more slowly over time, but if adoption continues to increase, yeah, it will become significantly more valuable, as demand increases faster than supply.  It's a long term investment though, not a short term one.  You can't expect the massive increases in value we've seen with transparency coins, because even if Tesla or Walmart *do* buy enormous amounts of Monero, it won't automatically be public knowledge.  (And if they do make a big deal about it, when it isn't automatically public, they may risk litigation for illegal market manipulation.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, do your own research.

I've said in a very clear way on my OP that monero is superior technology, and I didn't say in any way that bitcoin is better, or should be promoted by us, or anything of the likes. Maybe you didn't read the post.\n\nMaybe you have PTSD from the \"toxic culture\" on the bitcoin space, but now you're reproducing a similar behaviour. You say you \"understand where I'm at\" but I don't think you do. I'm trying to reconcile how bitcoin and monero are both important in a macro perspective including sociological and philosophical changes in how humans deal with money, and how monero can benefit from everything that is happening without having to resort to ultimate tribalism.\n\nYou can and should talk about bitcoin trade offs. You can and should talk about monero trade offs. But if you think this ultimately results in a \"us vs. them\" conflict then someone with your mindset wouldn't understand the frame I'm trying to explain in the OP.\n\nIt's ok that bitcoin has flaws and that it doesn't represent your ideals anymore. It doesn't represent my ideals neither, does that mean I have to neglect everything that that project has achieved and the path it's setting for other projects? Should I just reject reality and live with a tribal mindset ready to downplay how important bitcoin has been so far in the culture change we're living through?",

Based on zk-snarks, so there's some question about whether or not that cryptography is backdoored, due to the intel agencies and deepstate corporations associated with zcash, who created the crypto. It's also less well reviewed than Monero's cryptography.\n\nIt's better than coinjoin; but there still exists this risk, having put your coin into a common pool, maybe there's some gray area there how exchanges might treat it. \n\nTechnologically speaking, you still have to be pretty careful after you withdraw, in order to maintain that anonymity. You need to be sending your transactions over Tor. You have to be careful about every transaction you make after removing from the pool, and whether or not it betrays information regarding your identity. I'm willing to be there's a lot of wallets out there that leak alot of metadata and fingerprints in ways that only savvy security experts are going to know about. Also, your anonymity set is still going to be pretty low. Obviously the recipient isn't masked either. \n\nYou also have the problems of Eth fees of course. So participating is an extra transaction. Expensive. \n\nIt's better that it exists than it not to exist. But it's no replacement for being solid permissionless digital money in the way that Monero is.",

It does probably increase the cost somewhat for well resourced actors to spy on your activity; but it's not nearly as good as Tor.\n\nYes Tor has problems, and the NSA, if they're targeting you, are probably eventually going to find a way to get your real IP. But it significantly increases the effort/cost for them, and adds a really good obfuscation layer, that should do a pretty good job of preventing dragnet surveillance, even by large resource actors, particularly if you're just running an application like a crypto node or wallet. \n\nUsually where people get pwnd on Tor is using javascript in the browser. VPNs are much easier to compromise, and of course you have to trust that your VPN provider isn't a honeypot, and *extremely* dubious proposition.\n\nAs far as anonymity set ... Monero does 15-20k transactions *per day*. And since your outputs are used as decoys for those transactions, you enjoy a larger anonymity set than all other cryptocurrency anonymization protocols, combined.

After the mining GPUs are no longer profitable they become e-waste instead of getting sold to gamers for cheap (which WOULD happen if miners were using normal GPUs).\n\nAdditionally Nvidia doesn't get any extra chip making capacity, so there will still be a GPU shortage. It's just that they'll make more of the mining models and less of the gaming ones, because they get more profit on the mining cards.\n\nSo in the end, people who want a GPU for gaming lose out in two ways: there are no gaming GPUs being made because mining ones are much more profitable for Nvidia to sell, and gamers won't even get the benefit of buying cheap used ex-mining GPUs.\n\nSo basically fuck nvidia. They're making things worse for everyone (and the environment by making mining cards that become e-waste when they're no longer profitable) just to earn a bit more profit. They should have just put the price up on their existing GPUs instead.",

All no.\n\nEven the lead regulator for all US banks said recently that all blockchains are permissible for banking use *even ones with enhanced AML risks*.  Kraken lists *the most* XMR fiat pairs, and received a banking license. They said they're not aware of any regulatory pressure to delist.\n\nThis narrative needs to stop.

And all the data gives populist and other nasty politicians the chance to microtarget those that are easily influenced.   \n\n\nA whole generation is now growing up that thinks it is normal to have that much privacy intrusion.   \n\n\nSo privacy is pushed in the Anglo-American sphere as something nasty. We can look at China how total surveillance looks.   \n\n\nIn the EU things are a wee bit better with the GDPR. I heard someone saying that Monero is the only crypto that complies with EU regulations. I am not sure if that is true, as I am not a lawyer.  \n\n\nBut in the combination of unscrupulous governments and lazy and undereducated journalists, Monero will continue to be branded by the negative possibilities that privacy allows.   \n\n\nOn the other hand the fascination of common people with sex and crime will keep it in the lime light.\n\nIf it becomes more main stream, really depends if more journalists that have half a brain cell left start reporting in a more detailed manner. But I doubt it in the era of information overload, post truth and total government and business intrusion.    \n\n\nMonero is pretty much the last frontier to prevent total financial control by third parties.",

Projects like Tezos, EOS, and Cardano are really easy to push around, as they are meant to do literally everything in the world.\n\nMonero is already the most used coin in the darknet markets, and if i recall correctly, it's the 3rd largest in actual use. This makes it hard to pump as the market for XMR is much deeper than any shitcoin like SHIBA INU or whatever is the dog token of the day.\n\nXMR isn't traded in most exchanges, so you really have to be into privacy coins to know it, and by the time you found somewhere to buy a little of it, you're most likely going to be bullish in some other token.\n\nMonero is quite popular, but just in true usage, not so much in speculation.

And as developer I will tell you that no software project is easy, and the fact that eth has so many features make me unease because resources/time that can be used  to improve  X, as my first example, would be used to improve Y an Z, and you end up with  a product that does 3 mediocre things.\n\nAnother point is that smart contracts are probably to advance for the current time (it is not something that will just get fixed in the next 50 years)  or impractical, imagine 2000 years ago in Egypt/Rome someone start asking to invest money because they got the idea to build a computer,  yeah the idea eventually will work, but not matter how smart is the person/team and the resources that they have, or if they have a working computer. The technology to build them in masses, logistic, demand, etc. will not be there.\n\nSmart contract, have a lot of issue and the biggest one is that the law code around the world are a complete mess and still no one have been able to codify them into a computer which can answers simple questions and that not even scrap the surface of problem.",

Especially after atomic swaps are live and more importantly liquid,BTC and XMR will function more like two sides of the same coin. The Monero brand and community will still be around and function as a store of value because scaling PoW coins is difficult to say the least. I guess we need to wait and see.",

Prior to bitcoin, one of the primary problems facing a new kind of digital money was issuance - how do you distribute this new money? The previous attempts got in trouble because, if you just create a bunch of money and then distributed it, you become a centralized entity... something the feds used to not like. Thus, satoshi used the block reward as a way to distribute the coinage of the system in a decentralized way. no one could say \"hey, you are the one creating money\". Instead, its the protocol. \n\nAnd this is still somewhat true for PoS and in general, a lot of these ICOs and other crap. They mint the money first and then distribute it. Why the feds now turn a blind eye, I dunno.\n\nBut basically, if satoshi was in todays environment where apparently the feds don't seem to care about these kinds of things, there may not have been the need to innovate in such a way, and bitcoin as we know it wouldn't have come into existence.\n\nadditionally, all these PoS coins require the existence of a healthy cryptocurrency exchange infrastructure (because, again, how do you distribute), which didn't exist when satoshi invented bitcoin.",

Compare this to ASIC miners, where you have to put up 10k worth of equipment upfront to be remotely competitive. With RandomX individuals can re-use their computer, internet connection and physical space without any extra cost. In fact in some case operation might be free, because the \"waste\" heat can be used to heat the home, lowering heating costs proportionally.

Maybe I purchased them with money from the printing press my friend controlls, maybe I made them illegal and confiscated them, maybe I tax transactions with this token as a percentage of said token. Yes, it's not easy to get a lot of tokens, but once I have them, I *own* the network with *zero upkeep cost*. I may get some staking rewards, but I also get voting rights so I can exert control over the entire network, which I will definitely not use to change the rules in my favor.\n\nPoW on the other hand requires constant upkeep. You can not throw some cash at the network and own it the same way you can own PoS tokens. Sure, cash buys you hardware and you may control the network for some time, but eventually the cost and competition will overwhelm you. This is especially true with RandomX, where everyday citizens can just jump on the network and contribute their processing power instantly.\n\nThe difference is that PoS is a finite game that can be won, PoW is an infinite game that can only be played. You don't win or loose, you can only drop out if you loose the will or recources to play. Infinite games are much more resilient, as the player's goal is to keep the game running. This effort to perpetuate the game is worth the mining reward. (finite/infinite game terminology is borrowed from simon sinek, [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=simon+sinek+infinite+game))\n\nEdit: Maybe it helps to thing about this in terms of cashflow. PoS is an asset without any reoccuring cost, PoW is a liability that brings reoccuring cost any *maybe* profits. You can stay in you PoS position forever without putting any work into it, but PoW is inherently a dynamic system.",

In the sense of computational resources, randomX, more specifically single core performance is the way to go, due to the cache requirement, randomX performance doesn't scale up linear with core counts.\n\n1. Unlike gpu mining which is scaled by core counts or memory size significantly (and sometime even easier to make ASIC) to buy more cpus means more other system parts (server can have several cpus on them, but it's not as cheap as scaling up gpus). And 1. cpu's update rate is faster 2. cpu's single thread performance is hitting bottleneck recent years; that means buying more to mine may not even cover the hardware depreciation.\n2. Gpu are not that necessary for the system, SoC include one to meet basic media consumption requirements.\n3. And what's the fastest growing cpu market? it's the smartphones, specifically arm chips, their single core performance is catching up the more decent x86 cpus, due to the ISA difference and usually the more advance process node. Even now many people had owned a decent single core performance phone, and the owner population are definitely increasing. I don't see the monero community would give up on such great opportunity.\n\nAll in all, the rich may still have some advantage, but they would rather invest on something else. And with the increase of computational power per individual, I don't see and centralize group can compete the whole network.\n\nPS: that applies to the energy efficiency aspect too. 1. btc and eth mining are too efficient --> huge competitions, way more than what requires to maintain a health network 2. like I mentioned, process node improvement will keep decreasing TDP. 3. in a perfect world, everyone will only do POW when their device is idle, then the cpu power consumption is relatively small compare to the whole system.",

Monero is a necessity, it is valuable because people need it and will need even more in the future we seem to be moving towards. \n\nSo, if you truly believe in the fundamental value of Monero, the less you will want to shill it because the more time you'll have to stack it. Shilling is for those who want profit to come as quick as possible because they know whatever they are shilling has no fundamental value and, therefore, they don't want to stand too long on the quicksand.",

My basic understanding is that in the \"Land of the Free\", if you trade $250+ with another person in exchange for a currency or something functionally equivalent, then you need to KYC. Else, you're money laundering and looking at a mandatory minimum 10 years if convicted.\n\nSo yeah, bitching at sellers for following their rational self-interest doesn't help. The only thing that will, is changing the *laws*.\n\nI find this and many other state intrusions to be so much BS, that I moved to New Hampshire and now work to do things like help liberty-friendly candidates in the First in the Nation primaries, and help state-level pro-privacy/freedom-in-general candidates and bills (both of which we have in pretty decent number)",

Not yet implementing those bridges to DeFi capable blockchains and projects. Why? I think it's much too early.\n\nOne day the whole cryptoccurency universe may have matured up to a point where I can take a loan in Monero to buy a car and then pay back that loan over 5 years or so. Without anything bad happening: The price of Monero will be reasonably stable so I don't have to pay double (because my salary might still be in USD, unfortunately) for my car, the loaning entity will be trustworthy and will be still around in 5 years, and so on.\n\nOne day things might even be so stable that I can take a mortgage for my house in BTC, XMR, or whatever, and then pay back over an even longer period of, say, 20 years, and again this endevour does not descend into madness after 10 years or so, but everything moves along nicely and trustworthy, and all.\n\nOne day. This day has not yet arrived. Now is the time of boom-boost, of experimentation, of startups than crop up and vanish again, of scammers, of cryptocurrencies who bloom and later perish, and so on. I posit that now is not yet the time to invest person years of development effort to build bridges to systems that will turn out to not work, to exit-scam, to go bust, to get scammed and robbed, etc.\n\nLet's wait a few years more, see what really works and what is still standing, and **then** build the bridges.",

                            "response": "I have spoken to a couple or three or four people at work, offering to give them a little Monero, explaining how good it is. They all said no. They won't download a wallet. One lady said she'll talk to her husband about it. Another said she'd have to talk to her financial advisor (!!!). A young guy said he doesn't believe in crypto. It makes me feel like a shady salesperson doing a cold call trying to get someone involved in a multi-level marketing scam.\n\nBut I've had completely *different* results when I offer to \"pay\" someone in Monero, when I ask if they'd take a good \"cryptocurrency\" in exchange for a product or service. It seems when they're open to that idea, *that's* when I offer to show them how to download a free, private, open-source Monero wallet.  It's when I'm *not* trying to convince, but to help.\n\nI had a hard time understanding how Doug Tuman hardly had any waitstaff, for example, turn him down when he asked if they would accept tips in a Monero. But I believe him for sure now after my latest experiences.\n\nI think stickers and memes are fine, but having the nerve to speak in person -- simply using your voice to speak aloud the words, \"Would you accept payment in cryptocurrency?\" -- is much more effective.\n\nPerhaps this is because people are open to the idea of transacting with digital cash more than investing in it.  One feels like a good utility, a done deal, while the other sounds like a risk or investment -- something they're getting talked into.\n\nFinal thought: I also agree with Doug Tuman's recommending to new people the wallet from Monero.com instead of the regular Cakewallet (which I use), because then newbies are not distracted by other options during their first interaction with crypto. A person's \"first time\" with something often creates an emotional attachment to it. They can choose different wallets later if they want, but lead them directly into Monero first, so they can fall in love with it.",

                    "response": "I think that the real problem isn't the actual Zcash listing on Haveno, but how the team behind Haveno views their work and the Monero community. In order to be successful in this venture, the team behind Haveno must be very careful regarding the steps they take and how everything is presented to the community. \n\nThe Haveno team came out with a very unclear plan regarding the structure/management of the project, while asking for quite a large amount of money. This caused a lot of concern in the community and luckily they were able to come up with a better plan that asked for less money and was a bit more clear regarding Haveno's upkeep and management. It is my opinion that if they had their finger on the community's pulse they would have been more careful before submitting the first proposal.\n\nNow we are faced with an announcement that they will be launching the DEX with Zcash being one of the first 5 pairs. Yet again, they didn't have their finger on the pulse of the community. They should have known that Zcash is a project which is widely disliked in the Monero community and that launching it first would create issues, especially after all the initial miss-trust caused by their first CSS proposal. Instead of taking careful steps and being grateful for the community's support, Erciccione and the official Haveno handle have made inflammatory comments, stating that \"they could have gotten funding from VC instead of the community\". This shows arrogance and a lack of respect for the community as a whole. I understand that there are a lot of idiots, trolls, haters and personal beef within the people commenting against Haveno and Erciccione, but this does not mean that they are allowed to dissrespect the community and act in the way they are acting. Without the community Monero is nothing and it is extremely important for people in positions of authority to be extremely level-headed and calm when it comes to discussion and decisions. \n\nIf Monero was a community headed by a centralised authority that rules and conquers, it would be ok to act in the way the Haveno team has acted so far. BUT IT ISNT! Monero strives to be an anti-hierarchical community and in order to achieve this one needs to take into account even the most marginal voices. Even tiny divisions MUST be avoided because they have a tendency to grow into massive divisions. \n\nI haven't been a very active part of the monero community tbh, but I've spent years of my life in political groups and assemblies that try to be anti-hierarchical. I know from first hand how fast such formations can either become dictatorships or fall into shambles... \n\nGood luck to everyone involved. I really hate the trolls trying to throw mud on Haveno, but I equally don't like the way the Haveno team talk to the community sometimes.",

If so, was there a big difference between v1.0 and v2.0 of CryptoNote? Did Monero specifically utilise v1.0 or v2.0? I stumbled upon the whitepaper of v2.0 written by Nicolas van Saberhagen, and I would like to quote some of the things he states which are pretty good to use for arguments within a paper to illustrate certain points of why, for instance, Bitcoin is bad compared to Monero.\r  \n\r  \nThe reason why I'm asking here is because after doing some digging, some people exclude CryptoNote and refer to Monero's privacy capability solely under \"ring signatures\" (which from what I've read, CryptoNote enables?) - so it's just confusing for me when people don't relate to CryptoNote and rather draw attention to only \"ring signatures\", as if Monero were to create it and implement it themselves.\r  \n\r  \nProbably just a simple misunderstanding from my side, but I just want to make sure.\r  \n\r  \nThanks.",

Other coins just adding privacy features for a hype and do not actually care about its confidentiality\n\nCurrent problems on privacy:\nZCash: Its shielded transaction usage is not mandatory thus makes most people and exchanges only use transparent transaction, since it is the eaiest to implement and do not annoy the IRS/FBI/CIA/any three letter thing you can remember. Privacy is like anonymity set, if private setting is not the default behavior anyone who choose to use private setting immediately becomes a outstanding target on the blockchain. ZCash CEO even lost a bet on twitter, he tried to use a shielded transaction to prove ZCash privacy privacy, but the usage of shielded transaction is small, and someone easily discovered his transaprent account before the shielded transaction. \n\nHaven protocol: Nothing but just a monero fork, work the same as monero except it sometimes encounter a bug and network freezes for a while for bug fixing\n\nDASH: Providers extremely weak privacy, not a privacy coin at all. Transparent like BTC, but adds some mix features which can be easily defeated by analysis and running master node yourself to observe transactions\n\nBitcoin: Not a privacy coin at all. CoinJoin coins are blacklisted by exchanges and lightening not accepted by most exchanges, hard to for those tainted coin to find liquidity and is a fungibility graveyard.\n\nBeam/Grin:MimbleWimble is also a extremely weak privacy protocol, simply running a supernode with reconfigured client can record all the transaction and rebuilt a complete blockchain. If these coins force nodes to run in SGX might improve the privacy and makes it a working private coin\n\nPIVX: A similar scam coin forked from ZCash, nothing special and most on chain transactionsa are transparent\n\nROSE/SCRT: Use intel SGX to protect its data, but on chain data is still transparent if you can somehow peek inside the SGX. It also requires all Intel SGX that are participating in the network cannot be cracked, and they must also cannot be cracked in the future which is extremely unlikely. Weak privacy because a Intel SGX vulnerability will screw up everything. Instead of trust on math you are trusting a company\n\nARRR: ZCash fork that makes private transaction mandatory. Despite it is a scam coin(dev premine and they completed the trusted setup in a very shady way), it has a good on-chain privacy setting, but its userbase is too small and you cannot find many places that accepts it, and the coin is almost dead as there is no active development. \n\nVerge: A hype and no privacy protection provided\n\nDERO: A coin that maybe similar to Monero, but it userbase and marketcap is too small and cannot be used practically.\n\nFIRO: A very promising coin that might become a future monero competitor. If the dev team really fullfiled their promises and delivered the Lelantus Spark it will have default onchain privacy, and plus its coin burn and redeem feature it will become Monero Pro.",

Is the transaction private if I do just that? That is, Binance doesn't know where XMR goes, Kucoin doesn't know where XMR comes from, and other people know nothing of all this?\r  \n\r  \nOr do I need to take an intermediate step by first moving bought XMR to a wallet like MyMonero before sending it to the other CEX to maintain privacy?\r  \n\r  \nThanks for your advice.",

Do I just buy litecoin from coinbase, send it over to my binance wallet, and there's an option to convert it to XMR? Also, why buy from coinbase and not just binance itself? Is it really as simple as that?",

It will take lifetimes for the amount of newly generated xmr to match that of which was generated in a few years to a very very small amount of people. If Monero were to become mainstream, these random people would have insane amounts of wealth for little practical reason as I imagine these people didnt think Monero was going to get to that theoretical point.\n\nI wish the supply curve was a lot flatter as tail emission is coming up and Monero is fractions of its potential.",

Despite trying to research this point and the relationship between hashrate and energy consumption, I couldn't really find anything significant and just presumed the two were linked. \n\nAs I understand it now; due to RandomX, we get fewer hashes per second. But the consumption of electricity to get 1000 H/s for Monero could probably get you 100MHz if you were doing it for Bitcoin. So the while the hashrate might indicate the total power consumption for a blockchain, it depends on the hashing algorithm and also the hardware being used. So a lot of factors prevent hashrate being converted into energy consumption, and particularly so when comparing hashrate for different cryptocurrencies.\n\nIs that right?",

                    "response": "I think Monero will succeed when Bitcoin succeeds. \nMonero is the pinnacle of cryptocurrency as of now. The problem is society is just now starting to accept Bitcoin, barely. The main hurdle now is getting people to accept the consensus mechanism of both Bitcoin and Monero. \n\nI saw some individuals reference the dark markets. I think that's a good representation of how this will progress. The dark markets and users have historically been the first to adopt new technologies regarding privacy and security. They started with Bitcoin back with the silk road. As time went on we've seen most of them move primarily to Monero as their primary method of exchange. I think this is what we'll see on a large scale with the rest of society. \n\nOnce Bitcoin is commonplace, people will see its primary flaw. Its public ledger of transactions. When this becomes a problem people will look for a solution. That will be Moneros time to shine. \n\nFor now, though, I think we need to be united with the Bitcoin community. There is already so much division in the crypto space, rightfully so. I believe though that the Monero and Bitcoin communities are largely fighting for the same thing and that division among us will weaken our stance at this very important point in time. When the dominance of PoW is insured, I believe that's when we should have this discussion among our communities.",

Some things are more expensive and risky to process than others. That's where the price comes from.\n\nYou don't have to be a market taker, if you don't like the market. You can just create your own trade proposal and set your price to market -2%.\n\nTada! You've gone from a paying a 20% spread to paying a 2% spread. You'll soon learn, though, that market making comes with its own costs. You have to wait around for someone to respond to your ad (and they might not want to sell the full amount that you proposed). You have to deal with scammers trying to trick you into paying for no XMR. You have to build a reputation to be seen at the top of the list. \n\nI recommend connecting a telegram account so that you can be notified when someone responds to your ad. If you are offering a better price than mid-market price, you'll get an offer eventually, even with zero reputation score.",

Shortly after his arrest was made public, Russian authorities filed for extradition, hoping to bring Vannik back to Russia to try him on money laundering and fraud charges. \n\n> Because of this, Greece was put in something of a difficult position for two reasons. First, Russia was Greece\u2019s leading supplier of both oil and natural gas, and second, the US was Greece\u2019s most prominent NATO ally. \n\n> In a move to appease both sides, Greece sent Vannik to France in 2020, where he was eventually sentenced to five years in prison. However, a year later, Vannik was acquitted on several charges as French authorities could not prove any connection between Vannik and the distribution of the Locky ransomware software.\n\n> As of April, 2021, Vannik is still serving his jail sentence, and Russia and the United States continue to engage in a tug of war extradition battle\n\nBut this is more about a huge international money laundering operation involving the billions stolen from Mt.Gox, not just some exchange operating outside of the US and not enforcing KYC.",

Advertisements are for commercial products or services and Monero isn't that.\n\nThis propaganda is using [psychological reactance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4675534/) to automatically make the reader feel like they want to do the opposite. There are [plenty of examples](https://wizardofads.org/reverse-psychology-and-advertising-strategy/) of advertisements making use of this technique. A recent successful example is Patagonia using it in 2011; after this campaign they [quadrupled their sales estimates](https://bettermarketing.pub/dont-buy-this-jacket-patagonia-s-daring-campaign-2b37e145046b).\n\nFor people who don't know what Monero is and don't care to read the fine print, this is designed to act like a subconscious psychological reactance seed. For those who are hooked enough to read, it makes the reader question how some grassroots computer nerd movement could possibly weaken banks and states, two of the most powerful forces in our society.\n\nI've always liked it for this clever multi-pronged approach. All that said, there are probably better iterations of this that better fit with these times. Cryptocurrency has become more and more a part of the common vernacular so the point you made:\n\n>there's nothing in it to differentiate it from other cryptocurrencies\n\nmeans reduced positive impact on Monero by this propaganda every day.\n\n>even I could come up with something better than this.\n\nDo it, seriously. Then make a graphic and post it on the internet and see how effectively it spreads. If you find a winner make stickers and give them out. [Here's my attempt](https://i.imgur.com/5l8wAXn.png) at a version that still uses the original multi-pronged technique.\n\n\ud83e\udd18\ud83d\udc3a\ud83e\udd18",

Reverse psychology is sometimes referred to as\u00a0psychological reactance, which is the aroused state that occurs when a freedom is threatened or eliminated. The higher stake or more freedoms that are threatened, the more arousal that can be expected. People prefer to be free to select what they like. so when that freedom is taken away, they are motivated to restore it. Psychological reactance can be better explained as the idea that an item will be wanted more if people are told they cannot have it, which can relate to reverse psychology on some levels. Another influence technique that relates to reverse psychology is strategic self-anticonformity. Strategic self-anticonformity is when a person advocates a position that is opposite of their true thought, while hiding the fact that they are using a persuasion tactic. A common example of such is marketing techniques or tricks such as \"do not click this link,\" or \"do not push this button.\" Strategic self-anticonformity and psychological reactance relate in their expected negativity or disagreeableness from their influence target.\n\n- Wikipedia \n\nI know Wikipedia cannot be trusted for most information, so below is a more educational article.\n\n50 year review of psychological reactance theory: Do not read this article\n\nhttps://scholar.dominican.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=psychology-faculty-scholarship\n\nI recommend looking into this to get a better idea of how the \"Don't buy Monero\" advertisement is supposed to work. Or don't look into it the choice is yours.",

This impact is what makes someone more likely to look up the project and do their own research.\n\n**Appeal to og crypto ideologists**\n\nThere is a reason bitcoin was revolutionary when it came out. It was peer to peer digital money. The power it held was in an alternative from of money that could be used online without a third party needed. It's power never came from the establishment and banks backing it as their investment, it's true potential power was in creating an alternative system that would be more fair than the monopoly that central banks currently held and abused at the expense of most people. \n\nThis idea is what brought about most of the early users of bitcoin. It is still the same value proposition that bitcoin holds but it has been watered down as nothing more than marketing material for selling financial products around bitcoin. The thing is, there are still people looking for what bitcoin promised as the future in the early days. This ad targets those users and forces them to look into doing their own research. Which is all that Monero ads should strive for. \n\n**I would make one change**\nI would change \"cryptocurrencies\" and change it to \"anonymous money\". This can help bring to light the privacy issues you have talked about in your post. \n\nI think if you want to bring to light the tracking of users then more effective marketing campaign is in actively showing how easy it is to trace and correlate user activity to an address on public blockchains. Marketing materials then could be stickers that show something like \n\"What does your address say about you?\" \n\"CryptoTrackerlink\"\n\nThen you can show how that data is correlated and offer monero as the solution",

Unfortunately, the delay in the upcoming hard fork has also delayed OSPEAD. u/j-berman and I agreed a long time ago that OSPEAD would go into an update to the official wallet after the hard fork. At that time, we believed that the hard fork would happen in February or March 2022, but fixes to Monero's multisignature feature have delayed the hard fork. I said in my CCS proposal that I would use the transition from ring size 11 to 16 in the hard fork to help with the statistical estimation.\n\nI have a technical draft of part of OSPEAD that I can PM you if you wish. I have not posted it publicly yet since I am working on making it more understandable for laypeople and incorporating some \"dry run\" results from [here](https://github.com/Rucknium/OSPEAD).",

The large majority of xmr was mined when the coin was very unheard of which places large amounts in the hands of very few. It will take lifetimes for the amount of newly generated xmr to match that of which was generated in a few years to a very very small amount of people. If Monero were to become mainstream, these random people would have insane amounts of wealth for little practical reason as I imagine these people didnt think Monero was going to get to that theoretical point.\n\nI wish the supply curve was a lot flatter as tail emission is coming up and Monero is fractions of its potential.",

                    "response": "This is the way!\n\n>\nCrypto\nHome/Crypto\n\nThank you for your interest in crypto currency and Helicon Brewing!\n\nWe have created this FAQ to address questions of any potential crypto customers. If you have a question or concern that is not addressed below, please let us know! Questions and comments can be emailed to crypto@heliconbrewing.com.\n\nQ: How does paying a bill work?\n\nA: Paying with cryptocurrency at Helicon Brewing is easier than paying with a credit card. When the time comes to pay your bill, simply let the bartender know that you would like to pay with crypto and the crypto type; for example, Monero (XMR). The bartender will generate a receipt showing the amount of the chosen cryptocurrency due and a QR code for the deposit address. You will then deposit the amount due at the printed deposit address. After a brief interval, the length of which depends upon the type of cryptocurrency used, the bartender will get a notification of the deposit and close out the bar tab.\n\nQ: How does tipping work?\n\nA: The printed receipt will show the amount of crypto owed to pay the bill and will also show some suggested tip percentage amounts. Any amount of overpayment above the total due will automatically become a tip for the staff.\n\nQ: Does it cost anything to pay with cryptocurrency?\n\nA: It is actually cheaper to pay with cryptocurrency! To incentivize our guests to consider paying with cryptocurrency, we apply a 2% discount to all purchases made with cryptocurrency. The transaction fees are paid by the customer\u2013these are based on the type of cryptocurrency and are usually very small.\n\nQ: Which cryptocurrencies do you currently accept?\n\nA: At this time we accept Monero (XMR), Ripple (XRP), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Nano (NANO), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Dash (DASH), Litecoin (LTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nQ: Will you consider ever accepting <insert unsupported crypto type here>?\n\nA: Maybe! Adding a new cryptocurrency to our list is trivial. The one limitation is that we can only accept cryptocurrencies supported by Kraken. If you have a cryptocurrency that you are looking to spend, please let us know!\n\nQ: Why do you use Kraken?\n\n1) They support the cryptocurrency Monero.\n\n2) They are by all accounts the most reputable and fair exchange that exists today with among the lowest transaction fees and minimum deposit requirements.\n\n3) Their API to access deposit information is key to this all working. It is possible that Binance or other exchanges will be added in the future.\n\nQ: What program are you using to accept cryptocurrency payments?\n\nA: The owner of Helicon Brewing, Chris Brunetti, was a software developer before opening the brewery. He has written the entirety of the code himself.\n\nQ: Can my business be set up to accept cryptocurrency?\n\nA: Yes! We need some time to fully stress test the code. Once it is ready, it should be straightforward to get new businesses set up. If you would like to be added to our list of businesses interested in accepting cryptocurrency payments, please email us at crypto@heliconbrewing.com.\n\nQ: How is the exchange rate for cryptocurrency payments determined?\n\nA: At the time the request is made to pay the bill, the software obtains the current \u201cask\u201d price from Kraken. This rate is printed on each bill. If the customer is unhappy with the rate, they may choose instead to pay with cash or a card. Helicon Brewing reserves the right to not accept a particular cryptocurrency for any reason most notably if it is a volatile day.\n\nQ: What do you do with your cryptocurrency you receive as payments?\n\nA: We cash out the vast majority of the crypto we receive every evening and use it to pay our bills. Except for Monero\u2013we transfer that to our Trezor Model T conveniently located on our boat.\n\nQ: You mention Monero a lot, why?\n\nA: We believe that when the dust settles, the scams are over, the rug pulls are done, and adoption is significant, Monero will be the best and most popular cryptocurrency out there. The details are beyond the scope of this FAQ, but we\u2019d love it if you stopped in to talk about it!",

Like Dash instantly saying they're not a privacy coin just to not be delisted.\n\nI just think people should put more attention to this, and consider talking about it when presenting monero or comparing it with other projects.\n\nEthereum for example has changed their monetary policy a few times already, and with PoS it will change again. You could argue that there is \"consensus\" on this but realistically speaking if the US and EU governments pressured their developers and Vitalik to change the monetary policy (maybe even behind doors) or get banned, I think they would manufacture consensus to appease governments. Of course I'm speculating but I think it's not that far from reality, and this talking about a project the size of Ethereum... One can imagine how it would be for smaller projects.\n\nWith Monero we know that this wouldn't happen.",

Sadly, the majority does really not care that much about it.\n\nRather, crypto is attractive because of more practical reasons.  \na) Limited supply. In many countries we see high inflation of fiat money, which scares people who have something to lose.  \nb) Less bureaucracy. Easy account creation, no account fees, relatively fast and unlimited transaction amounts.  \nc) Censorship resistance. No third party can close your account or freeze your wallet. As long as you have your keys, you have financial freedom.\n\nIf we are talking about mass adoption, I think privacy plays mostly an indirect role.",

Partly because I don\u2019t view nominal price appreciation relative to fiat as something that is or will be unique to Monero. But also because greed is based in fear. So likewise I don\u2019t tell people dystopian visions of the future to convince them of Moneros merits. Where I tend to start is with \u201cthe money printer\u201d, and the endless varieties of corruption that have emerged because of this. To me Monero represents a chance at correcting many of these problems, an opportunity to actually progress beyond humanities current history-on-repeat loop regarding money, and a shot at having a more just society. I\u2019m not into Monero out of fear, I\u2019m into Monero out of a sense of determined optimism that we can steer the course of civilization back into the right direction.",

As far as I know there is no really simple automated and turnkey way yet to receive Monero payments. It's cetainly not merely knowing \"what command lines to use\" with `monero-wallet-cli` and/or `monero-wallet-rpc`. The former is interactive only, and the latter can only serve as a backend and cannot handle payments all on its own.\n\nIf you are determined you may start your journey into Monero at [Monero Integrations](https://github.com/monero-integrations).",

                    "response": "Greetings,\n\nAs a novice to the CryptoCurrency space and XMR, I had thought to better understand what the future potential of XMR might be.\n\nThe general control of government over our financial well being be it through inflation or restricting funds (per subjective value judgments in the Trucker Protest and ongoing Russian conflict) is unattractive. The intention of Bitcoin, to my understanding, was to wrestle this control from the Government, permitting financial freedom. However, Bitcoin though an improvement over our traditional financial system with regards to governmental control over the money supply can due to its public ledger have its transactions tracked permitting the imposition of financial restrictions. XMR (through some complex systems) resolves the issue of this tracking, so as to be an improvement over Bitcoin. \n\nAlbeit, this is where my confusion begins. Bitcoin and XMR were both intended as digital currencies, and for some thing to be a good currency (beyond acceptability which is increasing for both BTC and XMR alike), there must be a stability in its value. This stability is at present absent, and most all Crypto Currencies are viewed as investments, and I struggle to see why the prices of BTC and XMR must rationally continually increase? Is it due to only ever increasing adoption, for unlike ETH and others they (BTC and XMR) do not have additional utility through DApps and the like such that in the future these would only match inflation (if Fiat is still as powerful) or otherwise be stagnant so as to be hedge against the ills of government (more so in the case of XMR than BTC)? Or is it there something more like maybe the scarcity of XMR as people want to conduct private transactions in ever increasing amounts that would continually cause XMR to appreciate.\n\nEffectively, I'm not sure whether XMR is an investment or not. To my present understanding, it is in its ultimate form is what a checking account might have been today had the Gold Standard been not been abandoned or any shenanigans performed therein. So a great product but one does not expect great returns from one's checking account.\n\nI am grateful for your taking the time to read this post, and any thoughts you might share.\n\nWishing you a pleasant day/night.",

The war situation will educate many and confuse others about the potential of crypto \n\nEveryone first hears of btc, then maybe they learn of the host of issues including the censorship that you mentioned and xmr solves most of them. For me it is a logical decision to hold a chunk of xmr.\n\nMany tokens have inflation as well, btc and xmr are capped and the future will increase scarcity. Basic supply and demand.

For something like Bitcoin, which is digital *gold*/a store of value, then sure it makes sense to have a capped supply. But for *currency,* you don't want a fixed supply. More Monero is already lost than is being mined, so it's already slightly deflationary. A lot of people have gone into depth about why the tail emission is better than a fixed supply for currency, you can probably search \"tail emission\" in this sub and find plenty of results. I think localmonero also has an article on it, as well as sethforprivacy.\n\nBTC is what happens when you refuse to upgrade. Maxis go through absurd mental gymnastics to justify even the most simple shortcomings of Bitcoin, like the high fees, the bandaid non-solutions of the lightning network and segwit, the ugly soft forks, etc. And its only been a *decade*, I can't even want to imagine what it'll be like by the turn of the century. I suppose that since we're talking about a \"perfect\" currency then no such shortcomings would exist. But in anything resembling reality, having the ability to patch bugs, upgrade the network, etc are non-negotiable. An immutable protocol would be like swearing to only use MS-DOS for the rest of your life in the '80s and then being surprised that it's now outdated and generally unusable today in 2022.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd also add to the list that a node should be extremely easy to run. Maybe everyone could run a node on their phone in the background, sipping a fraction of a percent of its resources. The \"perfect\" currency is one which can run off of a smart toaster. This may actually become reality in the somewhat-distant future as technology advances exponentially.",

                    "response": "> Properties of a perfect cashlike cryptocurrency:\n\nFirst off, well done!  you've listed several points that I strongly agree with and feel like they have been largely overlooked for many years.  And I don't really disagree with any of your points.\n\nthanks for compiling this list!\n\n> Private (no transaction amounts visible on the blockchain)\n> Fungible\n\nyes, key properties of sound money, honest money.\n\n> High transaction speed/ Low transaction confirmation time\n> Immediate transactions possible (e.g. with second layer solution via hash locks). Better would be immediate (fully confirmed/secure) transactions on protocol level.\n\nImportant for efficiency/scale.  Ideally a cryptocurrency would have \"instant settlement\".\n\n> Fast wallet sync times\n\nyes, or no sync required.\n\n> Absolute maximum supply (solved problem of tail emission)\n\nunlike many/most here I agree with this.  One could go so far as to separate initial issuance/coinage from distribution.   ie, create all tokens initially, but somehow distribute them into circulation over time, ideally as compensation for useful work.\n\n> Proof of work algorithm, to have real energy as underlying value\n> ASIC resistant mining algorithm. Absolute future proof CPU mining algorithm, for maximum decentralization: using the most used CPU architecture (is it ARM nowadays and in future?)\n\nsure.   but other forms of \"useful work\" may be possible, so long as the system can verify them.\n\n> Quantum proof\n\nThis has about a -1 priority-level for me, as I don't believe in \"quantum computing\" any more than unicorns or the tooth fairy.\n\n> Auditability for each and every block (not only for transactions from the coin base), having absolute proof, that there are not too many coins in circulation, without revealing anything about anything\n\nyes.   supposing that blocks are used.\n\n> Some private P2P network to hide IP addresses (is Tor really the currently best option?)\n\nIP hiding is important.  There are options besides tor.\n\n> A peer to peer pool (like P2Pool) as pool mining mandatory, included in base protocol, to avoid any 51% attack.\n\nabsolutely.  something I've harped on in the past and it seems folks here are starting to come to the same realization.\n\n> Protocol immutability. Meaning: Never change the protocol again. Never having to adapt mining algorithm, but staying ASIC resistant. To not scare away mining investors.\n\nboom!  few realize the important of this.  even bitcoin changes too much for my taste.   But people want their money to be the same today as tomorrow as 30 years from now.  Markets want predictability above all.  Perhaps most fundamental:  Changing the rules of a money after people have invested into it is immoral.  full stop.\n\n> Being able to transact offline (no internet connection needed).\n\nnice to have certainly.   hard to achieve with digital currency.\n\n> Worldwide acceptance (world currency)\n\nthat should naturally follow (eventually) from being the best money, which I would say that the first one with all these properties would be.\n\n> NO transaction fees (somehow, any solutions there?)\n\nThis would be ideal, but how to deal with spam?   Perhaps if a truly dcentralized digital currency could be devised...  ie one that can prevent double spending without need for distributed full ledgers of all historical tx...\n\n> Digital, not paper.\n\nkeys can be stored in either medium... but yeah.\n\n> Extremely easy/cheap to run node\n\nagree.\n\n> Optimized coin reward curve for emission into the economy. Maybe some polynomial function of 3rd degree, but convergent.\n\nI haven't given much thought to this.   Can you expand on the rationale?\n\n> No pre-mine.\n\nright.  or more generally: fair distribution.\n\nI would add one more:\n\n* Anonymous author(s).   thus no one to go after.",

Additionally, possessing dirty bitcoins might incriminate a person even if they did not commit a crime. Let\u2019s look at the current situation in Canada where they flagged their bitcoins.

Yea, some are coin joining but still why go through all that hassle and still not be fungible even after a coinjoin\n\n2- Who the hell wants to pay high transactions fees?? Sure btc transaction fees are low right now at 30-40 cents per transaction but everyone knows damn well once it starts to get congested again (which it will due to the btc devs not enlarging the block size) fees will start to cost $3 then $6.  I\u2019ve seen them go up to $20 before\u2026 XMR is designed to have minimal fees possible for EVER!! that means that XMR can hit $1,000,000 and fees can potentially still be 1 penny\n\n3- Do you actually believe most of the people know the difference between BTC,XMR or even DodgeCoin?? Hell freaking no!!! All they care about is which coin is going to fill their bags with Fiat and get it swallowed up by inflation later\u202699% of BTC content out there is just number go up Bulls*** \u2026.XmR community is well informed and we know the true value of XMR \u2026 I would always prefer XMR over some expensive, slow, surveillance coin for the simple fact that  I know damn well XMR is what we thought BTC was when we first bought it.\n\nLastly, as for network effect this is the way i see it. what\u2019s better??? 1,000 miners mining at a total network hashrate of 100th/s (btc example)\u2026.or 1,000,000 miners mining at a total network hashrate of 10th/s? (Xmr example) How safe is this?? And if we do reach that \u201csafe number\u201d is it really decentralized? \n*** those numbers about hash rate and miners are figuratively speaking, those aren\u2019t actually numbers but the main thing I am trying to get across is that not everyone can afford a $10k asic to mine BTC \u2026 now anyone fan mine XMR with their laptops***",

There will be many different groups of people \"shilling\" different coins based upon their personal use case. I think many of us can agree that Bitcoin has justified its existence in this space, based upon the fact that it is the first network and also the largest network. Granted, there are some features that some of us consider undesirable (such as the algorithm which is ASIC only) but I think we can all universally agree to look past these aspects that can be considered flaws and agree that the institutional adoption of Bitcoin is a great starting point. If we see more governments accepting Bitcoin as payment, we can expect the entire market to grow as well. Monero is my favorite coin due to my use case and personal beliefs and I think Bitcoin is a great starting point for novices due to its simplicity and widespread adoption. However, as much as I like Monero, I would prefer that governments and institutions use a coin with a transparent ledger for obvious reasons.",

The only two concepts \"contrary to Bitcoin and still left\" are ring signatures and stealth addresses, however they have been advanced by RingCT (Ring Confidential Transactions, followed by Bulletproofs) which also hide the amount of every transaction. Ring Tx have been made mandatory and rings made bigger every hard fork since. The original mining algorithm has been switched several times after the first ASICs have been discovered for Cryptonight, until finally a completely new solution RandomX has been developed and unbroken for two years now. Mining decentralisation has been pushed forward just recently with [p2pool](https://p2pool.observer/) being released, which allows pool mining without a centralised entity.\n\nAnother great resource adding to \"From Zero to Monero\" is [Mastering Monero](https://masteringmonero.com/).\n\nIf you have any questions on particular parts of the development, feel free to ask me, I'm quite familiar being here since 2016 and also reading up all the development made in the two years before.",

There are no links to moneroaddress.org in getmonero.org/downloads/\n3. I actually overlooked \"How to create a Monero paper wallet\" guide in getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/, because I looked in \"wallets\" section there, and not in \"general\"\n4. It is unclear whether the author of moneroaddress.org is connected to the developers of Monero or is some random person on the Internet\n5. After losing some money on various interactions with cryptocurrencies I've developed an (un)healthy paranoia about security and trust, and began to treat everything crypto-related from \"untrustworthy until somehow proven otherwise\" standpoint.\n\nSome may say that the source code of monero-wallet-generator is provided, but to check it for backdoors one must have qualifications to write a wallet generator on their own, and I don't have such qualifications.\n\nDisclaimer: English isn't my first language, so there probably are lots of errors in the above text, I'm sorry I did my best.",

But 5 members are too insufficient.\n\nI imagine the following structure: you have to elect 10 people from Haveno community and 10 people from Monero community. Some of that people are from corresponding core devs, some just prominent members of corresponding communities.\n\nThus Council consists of 20 elected people. Among them there is quorum of minimum 10 people who can make a final decision.\n\nApart of that, there is predefined fixed percentage on spending funds between Monero and Haveno CCS proposals, for example 50% vs 50%, 40 vs 60 etc.\n\nCouncil members are voted Each year, and percentage between Monero and Haveno is voted by elected members each year.\n\nThis structure is not ideal but quite simple and robust against everyday life complications: for example 10 from 20 Council members may be off-line in every moment a new CCS proposal needs voting procedure.",

It's courageous to make the whole project depend on approval by an external entity. I have some questions, objections and suggestions:\n\n- Let's avoid decentralization theater, which we criticize Zcash for. Please don't compare this to the CCS when it's the Engine Council which makes the final decisions rather than individual donors.\n- 5 council members seems a low number for such a responsibility. I'd prefer 7. To avoid centralization, I wouldn't recommend giving this responsibility to the Core Team.\n- How will council members be selected? How will they be replaced when one leaves? We don't have a register of voters.\n- An all-or-nothing proposal from Haveno doesn't give the Engine Council a real choice. Instead, you could propose a range and specify what could be done for the lowest or the highest amount.\n- In this setup, it's in the interest of both Haveno developers and the Monero community to keep fees as high as possible. Of course Haveno doesn't want to price itself out of the market, but you seem a little too happy about the income stream.\n- There's so much uncertainty in the crypto ecosystem and the price of Monero that fixed budgets are a fiction. My suggestion is to use the income stream from Haveno fees to match donations from individual community members - at least partially. Sort of like the Gitcoin matching pools (without the quadratic funding, which requires a kind of identity). Gitcoin donations go to projects and people rather than specific tasks, which seems to work out well for Ethereum. This would help to close the gap between people who are funded regularly and people who aren't funded at all. And of course this would decentralize decision-making across community members who contribute financially to Haveno or Monero.",

I don't see the value of adding stricter terms than with any other ccs before, especially since the amount would be already significant and adding an interest on top of it would just make it harder to reach our goal. And for what? A little bit more money on top of the thousands that Monero will receive indefinitely? I don't see the point. I also don't like the idea of using the same structures as a bank.

If you're only just now looking into Monero, you might ask yourself what factors are relevant for if/why there was a delay for you personally. Because those are probably similar factors for other people as well.\n\nYou might be able to offer us some insight actually.\n\nPersonally, I think it's because the big corporate players and exchanges don't advertise it like they do everything else. Most of the big talking heads also ignore it. I believe that the power hungry players in crypto ignore XMR for two main reasons:\n\n1. Chain analysis. These guys are running multi-billion dollar per year chain analysis industry. And a coin like Monero invalidates their multiple chain-analysis business models. \n\n2. No premine, no ASICs, no block reward diversions. I can't think of any other coins that crypto whales/exchanges didn't get a huge bag for free (or nearly for free). When they sell people tokens they got on the cheap, that's huge profit for them.\n\nUltimately I think it can essentially be explained by profit and power. These people value having control over the ecosystem, and lining their pockets, more than they care about your right to privacy.",

The project has some review culture, but this is something I wish maintainers and janitors would be pushing for more. A lot of smallish PR's are hardly getting any review. There are parts of the code that need serious refactoring., while others are indeed well designed. Many parts of the code have been experiencing feature creep leading to complex and hard to read code.  \n\n\nI am actually not sure if knowledge isolation is really that big of a problem in the project right now. Sure, it can always be better, but there is decent documentation on the parts that matter, a lot of theory and details are described in the MRL notes and Zero-to-Monero and the consensus parts of the code are at least commented a bit.",

It's a hard fork, not a soft one, and it works with adoption.[https://localmonero.co/knowledge/network-upgrades](https://localmonero.co/knowledge/network-upgrades)\n2. For several reasons, but mostly because of tail emission, the miner is paid by the network mostly, not by the fees of the sender.\n3. Yes and no, the inflation is really low (below 1% currently) and will forever go lower. So technically it will devaluate XMR by less than 1% per year, but who cares. It's the price to pay to keep low fees. All fiat currencies devaluate faster than that.Also don't forget that a lot of crypto is lost forever all the time because of the users dying or losing their keys, thus acting as a deflationary force.\n4. I'm not as optimistic as the cultist people here want me to be.  \nI think it will be banned for use everywhere because it inconveniences the banks and the governments, and that it will continue to be mostly used for criminal activity (drug trade, tax evasion, marital asset hiding, political activism, etc) for as long as it's the most private and safe way to transact.  \nIt is possible that Monero will be \"integrated\" in a state financial system like Salvador does with Bitcoin or Russia with other cryptos, but in order to use those cryptos legally you need to identify yourself, allow yourself to be spied on, and go through their system, which defeats the entire point of Monero in the first place.",

                    "response": "Good questions, welcome to the Monero family!\n\n1. Monero has no soft forks, but regular hard forks to roll out better tech for privacy and usability. It used to be every six months, but consensus among currently active developers, researchers and the community in Monero (you are welcome to join any of those groups and take a voice) is that they will be less often in the future, if not needed, since it requires all wallets, exchanges and merchants to upgrade their software. Last hard fork has been more than a year ago in October 2020 and next one is scheduled to be somewhere in April/May 2022. Why hard fork? To enforce the best privacy for all transactions so they are as indistinguishable from each other, unlike in Bitcoin you have e.g. old format addresses, new format, segwit or not, taproot or not, ...\n2. The major mining incentive is block rewards to ensure a healthy hash rate, no matter how many usage there is at a certain point. Tho fees will go up a bit by x5 in the next hard fork, but they are designed to be low in the long run. There is no fixed block size but a dynamic one, which can be slowly adjusted by miners. To create a larger block than the standard block size of 300kB every \\~2 minutes, a miner has to pay a penalty of his block reward, which has to be paid up by transaction fees. The function is quadratic, so raising the block size by 10% will result in only 1% penalty, 50% in 25% and finally 100% in 100% penalty. The current limit is counted against the median of the last 100 (and 10,000) blocks and once this raises, this is the new limit without penalty. Fees paid in XMR will equally go down with higher block size, so doubled usage means half of the fees. However, you can't predict markets and fiat prices.\n3. The inflation of gold is \\~1-2% per year for now hundreds of years and gold still holds its value in comparison to other mediums of exchange. A strictly deflationary system is probably never be a good medium of exchange and one could argue that is the only use case for cryptocurrency. If you know a money is deflationary, you will prefer to spend anything else but not this money, but then again you disqualify it to be money, when nobody is using it and we will not see more adoption in the real world. Sure, you can make a new narrative like Bitcoin did into \"Digital Gold\" but scarcity is not a guarantee to be somehow valuable in the long run. Gold has real demand for jewellery, technology and religion while one could argue nobody needs Bitcoin in the end, when it's not an adopted medium of exchange.\n4. That's also hard to predict, however we see more and more real adoption outside the darknet, one of the best examples is [Coincards](https://twitter.com/CoinCards/status/1489760991818633216), but also Travala accepting it. When it comes to hosting, domains or VPS we see more and more adding it, otherwise we have 'proxy-like' shops like [Proxysto.re](https://digitalgoods.proxysto.re/) to onboard those who have not yet implemented it natively. However, from my experience if you kindly ask shop accepting Bitcoin, most of them will also accept Monero manually. Russia is not considering Bitcoin, but crypto and not as a currency, but as of my understanding to regulate it at all, since as of today it's kind of grey market. It will be hard for regulators to allow transparent coins but not privacy focussed ones. Where is the barrier? What about Lightning Network and CoinJoins? If you ban those, you kill Bitcoin as a whole, since no merchant has access to chain-analysis tools and can't determine if coins he receives are tainted or not. Not a problem with Monero btw. - so Monero has actually the potential to become a currency while I doubt Bitcoin has. Sure, it will take another 10 years or longer (if ever), but hey, the world is transforming at such a speed, that you can't predict what 'social' network will be 'next', TikTok's usage is skyrocketing while Youtube is flattening, the former only founded 4 years ago. There can be a single important event causing Monero's usage to skyrocket, while I don't see such a possiblity for Bitcoin - alone from fee perspective & privacy. LN is no solution if non-custodial matters (and that's the kind of events I would expect) since it's an interactive protocol requiring both parties to be connected (and that might become a problem when crypto might become important).\n\nDisclaimer: I've been in Bitcoin since 2012, bought my first 1 BTC for $15 paid with Liberty Reserve on some obscure service. After the block size wars I left the space for \\~2 years until I discovered Monero in 2015/16 and well, I'm still around...",

Bitcoin blocks are limited to 1mb, so if the size of all the txs combined exceeds that, miners just take the txs that are paying the highest fees and ignore the txs that pay less, which causes tx fees to push up. Ethereum has a similar problem, although this time its because Ethereum also runs smart contracts on its blockchain so some of its txs are huge.\n\nMonero does allow for block size to change, although larger blocks increase the risk of orphan blocks being created. Monero does have bigger tx size in order to keep the transactions private but the monero dev team has done a lot of research into reducing this (most recent example would be the introduction of  bulletproofs)",

You stated the yearly inflation which will just decline further, asymptotically approaching 0. As of now, the \"real\" inflation rate might already be negative (as with BTC?) by coins being destroyed continually.\n\nI dont know how it will hold up in the future, though I think hard caps are a straight death sentence as at some point I figure mining rewards wont cut it and subsequently miners will leave and give up their gear. With BTC the asics could fall in price and while energy costs are still a thing, attacks would become ever more likely.\n\nIf you like hard cap, you can check out r/Wownero with shares many similarities with monero.",

The issues you mention reflect a history of Monero being developed in response to Bitcoin and promoted to people who were already familiar with Bitcoin. The front page and the header of the Get Started page do explain that XMR is Monero. There are also links to more information on the front page and tooltips with definitions on the Get Started page.\n\nIt's not like we want to block improvements, but there are complications: \n- The downside of a truly decentralized project is that there's no one who can make the decision to overhaul the website, like you can do for a company coin. It's easier to add content than to remove another volunteer's contribution. The current maintainer will be leaving and is [stretching out payments](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/erciccione-website7.html) for parttime work over a longer period. The Core Team see themselves as stewards of the protocol and don't want to micromanage the website.\n- There's little overlap between people who understand how Monero works and people who can explain this in simple terms. Even fewer remain when you want them to understand both code and design.\n- For security reasons, we don't use JavaScript at all. It's actually amazing what the devs did manage to do without JS. But this means we can't use the frameworks that most tech firms use.\n- A radical redesign might mean that dozens of contributors would have to adapt to a new process.\n- The site has been partially translated into 14 languages. Changing essential parts like the front page would mean those pages would be displayed in English until volunteers could be found to translate them again.\n\nHaving said that, it would be great if you created your own video or website, unfettered by these limitations. And you could check out https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site to see what you can contribute to getmonero.org.",

However, profitability would skyrocket for p2pool miners and I think at least some would switch to p2pool only, which in the long term might bring a decent decentralisation and thus security, since HR would probably come back to \"rational\" levels, where mining is profitable at normal electricity costs.",

People who get elected aren't generally literally evil. Their actions are just the natural result of perverse incentives. People in government have levers of control and are told they need to solve societal problems. So they predictably use [Maslow's Hammer](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/you-are-not-so-smart/201203/maslows-hammer).\n\nBear in mind that while governments are bumbling, incompetent, armed, and dangerous... this does not mean that the problems they are trying to deal with aren't real and important. Just that their response is unhelpful.\n\nThere really is a pandemic. Millions of people have died in the last 2 years that would not have died if proper masking had been widespread 2 years ago. Clearly awkward mandates and poor communications have not helped. But N95's definitely have.\n\nSimilarly, there really is a potentially catastrophic set of environmental threats including a CO2 cycle that is way out of equilibrium, and a much more urgent and alarming loss of biodiversity and habitat. Clearly one-child policies and trading carbon credits hasn't resolved these issues.\n\nThe point is: an misanthropic liar who yells \"fire!\" in your face may in fact be conveying information about a real threat.",

On the other hand, I think it is best to steer as far away from the idea that this constitutes a \"new cryptocurrency\", as possible.\n\nThe flow of information is very fractional, out towards the broader community of participants, and I think it's best for most people to simply get the message that \"it's same old Monero that you know and trust, with some more upgrades under the hood\".\n\nAs much of a monumental task this is for those in development, the userbase will just perceive this as \"hey, the view keys finally work now!\" and \"I need to remember to not reuse any of my pre-upgrade addresses!\"",

But this is not what I mainly talk about.\n\nI you are a dev you are acutely aware about the crucial importance of APIs for building applications: You can only start your work after the API you need gets published and stays reasonably stable.\n\nImagine that Google plans a new version of its Android OS, with quite extensive API changes that will affect most apps, and Google puts out stark warnings to the devs \"API changes incoming! Your apps will flat-out stop to work if you don't adapt\", but then does **not** publish those changes in a timely manner.

You now have my attention. \n\nHere\u2019s my question though, if it\u2019s anonymous how do you actually plan on using it? Are you waiting for more mainstream adoption or do you guys have another way to cash out cleanly? I\u2019m just curious how it all works.\n\nFeel free to dm me or comment, I will go watch some simple Monero videos now. Tired of this shit",

There's a few things that he has just slightly wrong, and they can all be addressed with ...\n\n2. A proper cryptocurrency is a *digital bearer asset*. \n\nI understand the magnitude of such statements might be lost on most people, so let me elaborate ...\n\nCrypto is not muh store of valor. A store of value can't oscillate by 5-10x within less than half a year. You could come back to madgainz, or you might come back to 10 cents on the dollar. \n\nCrypto obviously isn't a currency. Maybe one day it could be, but it's definitely not. Neither is it gold. Monero comes the closest to the digital gold idea; but again, it's too volatile, and gold was established first via its transactional usage for thousands of years.  This is again why Monero comes closest, because of it's fungibility and (limited) transactional usage. But it's still a tenuous comparison for now. Maybe that will change one day. \n\n### Okay, so let's get back digital bearer asset\n\nCrypto was the first time the world had ever seen the ability to hold a *digital asset* where access to your funds wasn't predicated on the agreement of some bank, broker, or govt. That's really powerful. Cash is a bearer asset. Gold is a bearer asset. They even used to have bearer bonds and bearer equity certificates, but that was phased out due to muh terrorism and money laundering. \n\nHere we make a comparison. The notion of a *digital* bearer asset is so fundamentally good and useful, that cyclical schemes of fraud and speculation can be built on top of it; destroyed and washed away, and then built again. Yet crypto remains. The very first one still runs to this day, and for all its failings, still exists as the largest.\n\nThe comparison then, is to equities (the stock market). The notion of holding an ownership stake in a company is so fundamentally good and useful, that they can forever blow bubbles and manipulate the shit out of the stock market. Crash it all; only for it to come back larger. \n\nIn both cases, whether equities or digital bearer assets; the foundation is strong enough to survive the fraud. And humans just love them some fraud. It's actually the 3 or 4 massive fraud induced bubbles in crypto, yet it's still here, that's the strongest case for demonstrating its strength. \n\nAnd this is where guys like in this video go wrong. They see the fraud and they come to the wrong conclusions, because they haven't been able to properly nail down what exactly is being accomplished with crypto. And so they mistakenly make crypto and fraud synonymous. They miss the more fundamental precept. \n\nIt's actually one of those times that a very subtle miss, causes a very large mistake.  It happens because no one informed them of the actual truth of matters; so eventually they reject an idea on the basis of the bad arguments that the proponents made for it. I tell this to you, Monero, because if we have *better* arguments, it sets us apart; just like everything else about Monero.\n\n\nMonero aint going away, and even though I don't like it too much anymore, neither is Bitcoin. Fraud be damned, bubbles be damned. The fundamental nature of it (at least *some* of it) is so good that it'll be here forever now.",

So from my understanding, the main points are\n\n* fiat is backed by governments\n* cryptocurrency is not\n* therefore, cryptocurrency = bad.\n\n<walloftext>\n\nCryptocurrency is backed by the laws of mathematics, fiat is backed by promises made by people who are notorious for breaking promises. Fiat is a piece of paper which was arbitrarily declared to have value by the very same entity which controls, manufactures, and administers it. Cryptocurrency is trustless, provably consistent, and secured by a global decentralized network of incentivized users instead of distant, greedy, corrupted, and manipulative politicians. Venezuela, Zimbabwe, or the Weimar Republic is not some natural phenomenon. Those situations are the *direct result* of having fake, unbacked currency.\n\nNow, this person is trying to argue that cryptocurrency is worthless because it's just 1's and 0's which happen to be valued by the users (which is arguably not even true, it's much more complex than that), but by this logic, nothing can have value. Gold is just a pretty rock, who cares? The value of gold, of course, comes from the fact that society values it, and from the fact that it is a scarce resource. All currencies are nothing more than a societally-agreed-upon way to make trade easier. That's the ENTIRE POINT of currency. He argues that fiat has value because big daddy gubermint said so, but why the fuck do we listen to them? And where do you think the government itself receives its societal legitimacy from in the first place? At least gold is provably scare, but even that is relatively unstable compared to the mathematical precision of crypto. Fiat, on the other hand, is literally just a piece of paper.\n\nThe only half-decent argument made here is the issue of adoption. Cryptocurrency is currently treated as an investment, not a currency, and as a result the price is volatile. This disincentivizes businesses from accepting it, which results in a catch 22. This is admittedly a real issue, but this is no fault of the invention itself (it brings us back to the problem of societal valuation), and we have to remember that cryptocurrency is still in its infancy. Crypto could not replace fiat by tomorrow obviously, but it's barely a decade old at this point, and only mainstream within the last few years. It takes time.\n\n</walloftext>  \n\n\n**TLDR**: all of the arguments made against crypto are true for fiat as well, and to a much larger extent. Not to mention the innumerable issues with fiat, ones which crypto is completely immune to. This person clearly doesn't understand cryptocurrency very well.",

Citizens won't reject CBDCs because they'll be made ubiquitous and will be fully-integrated into the established financial system, thus making them easy and convenient to use. And as we've seen time and time again, most people tend to prioritize convenience over personal freedoms and privacy, so don't hold your breath.\n\nHowever, where Monero can really make an impact is in parallel and shadow economies where the use of CBDCs is too risky or impractical, so there is actually plenty of room for adoption and growth over time. Black markets are inevitable and eternal, so I'm not worried at all about Monero's future relevancy.",

Characterized by unfalsifiability, appeals to things that don't exist, presumptions about their own correctness, and hand waving away all problems into a set of thought terminating cliches and appeals to future dev.\n\nThey think that they can create the future by collectively hallucinating away the present limitations. They believe that they can narrative their way into global acceptance.\n\nUnderlying it all are two main factors: #1 Principle number 1, NumberGoUP. It's all really just a delusional attempt at thinking they'll get another 1,000x on their $5k to $50k worth of Bitcoin. They won't. And #2, the need for the satisfaction of higher purpose, manifested in the form of CultLite\u2122 . There's a reason cults are so appealing to so many people, and the maxis found ways to pretend like what they're doing is not religion.\n\nOr hell, I even have at least a couple irl acquaintances who make no qualms about it being a religion. They even embrace the notion that they're (in their minds) creating Jordan Peterson style metaphorical religious truths that transcend ordinary reality. Yes. Literally. They think this, and have told me. They're OGs, and represent a sampling of maxis. Think of guys like Max Keiser. They have drank their own koolaid\n\nThey're not even bad people, often they're even quite good people. Kind of like evangelicals who believe some crazy shit, but are otherwise nice and productive people. \n\nAnd not all Bitcoiners are maxis like that. Usually someone who says, \"I like Bitcoin but I'm interested in other projects too\" is not a maximalist. Altho usually that kind of generic thinking is also because they don't realize that the vast majority of the space is almost entirely borne out of cashgrabs.",

Monero currently has no recourse built in. It is electronic cash. Just like regular cash can be stolen and people can be ripped off while paying in cash, the same can happen with electronic cash (Monero).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>How would I buy a service in monero and have a guarantee that the reciepient wont run off with the money?\n\nMy answer to this then would be two things.  \n1) Make sure to only make purchases from people/business who have good reputations. Just like you go and look at Yelp reviews, you need to make sure the people you are dealing with aren't scam artists.  \n2) You can use a service that offers escrow. IE Localmonero offers escrow service so if you bought gold from someone and it never showed up, you could get your Monero back since Localmonero holds onto your XMR while the transaction is pending.",

On one hand we could say Monero's set of historical data is a boon but on another it's like nuclear waste. For example ring sigs cannot provide sender privacy in certain types of wallet output creation and usage behavior that is presently supported and quite possible, so I suggest prioritizing research to replace them with e.g. a zk proof.",

They make a note of the outputs which these criminals spent, send them to all of the exchanges in their jurisdiction, and announce that purchasing any of those outputs will be aiding criminal activity. You end up with these coins because you sold some guy your old computer. He got the coins from his nephew who bought them from an exchange that the criminals sold to before the coins were blacklisted. You unwittingly try to sell them on an exchange. Not only does the exchange refuse to buy your coins, but they send your name to law enforcement. Law enforcement quickly find out after questioning you that you had nothing to do with it, but they seize your coins.\n\nAs another example, suppose you use your coins to buy a gaming PC online with an account you share with your spouse. The store uses a chain analysis service and finds that one of the outputs you used to buy the gaming PC was change from an output used to buy a premium pornography subscription. They start putting ads in your account for hentai pillows, which is embarrassing and annoying.",

It literally depends on the people, how far we are collectively willing to systematically sacrifice our freedom for empty promises of safety.\n\nThe issue is when their algorithms can relate your transaction to crypto based on the transaction description or either/both parties already being known as being crypto-persons.\n\nI've not been able to figure out exactly what triggered the flags in my cases, but i highly suspect it was mostly due to transaction descriptions that can be considered as crypto-related. So one may want to be cautious with that.\n\nI've lost funds too from exchanges that just flag/freeze your account and then KYC the sh\\*t out of you until you get to a point where you can no longer provide documentation or evidence to support your story and they just confiscate your funds indefinitely. Point in case, get your coins off the exchanges if you're not actively trading them and try to find decentralized ways to exchange/trade.",

Here are some interesting results from the FATF https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Second-12-Month-Review-Revised-FATF-Standards-Virtual-Assets-VASPS.pdf. See graph 3  on page 27.\n\n> Proportion of identified illicit bitcoin transactions between 2016-2020\n\nThe blockchain surveillance (BS) companies were all over the place. with results ranging from 0.5% to 12.7%. This is for their totals over ~10^8 transactions. Just imagine their false positive and false negative rates for *individual* transactions. \n\nPlease do not call Bitcoin a surveillance coin. This only serves to further the narrative of the BS companies and can send innocent people to prison or worse. \n\nOne of the most critical application of Monero's privacy is to avoid being falsely accused of a serious crime or terrorist act by the BS companies. Those who spend BTC for example could be victims of a serious false accusation, with little or no recourse, especially if the BTC can be linked to them.",

I don't think the bank account metaphor works here b/c my bank absolutely knows who I am and the details of all  of my accounts are  known to many parties.  KYC/AML necessitate that.  There's no notion of Private transactions,  for those we use \"Cash\" but the contents of our digital accounts are open to countless parties so it would indeed be weird to call it a 'private  bank account'.  If you  have offshore accounts, you absolutely differentiate between them and standard bank accounts.  Many of us not only use offshore accounts but also keep assets in trusts b/c it's no one's business what we own , again to obscure ownership and retain privacy b/c standard back accounts are quite clear.\n\nBlockchain by its nature is public.  A whole lot of people think Blockchain/esp BTC is anonymous. I can't even count all the times I've heard some anti-blockchainer thinking they are dunking on Crypto b/c the government retrieved stolen btc or seized it.\n\nSure, anyone involved enough to use it should know the use case, but it's a big differentiator and a feature.  Secure Connections, Encrypted Emails, all of them offer protections above and beyond the default.    \n\n\n***As a community I think we should be YELLING \"THE GOVERNMENT KEEPS SECRETS FROM US, WHY IS IT NOT OK TO HIDE THINGS FROM THEM?\" I think we should all be very aggressive about how bad our privacy has been invaded and Start being PROUD OF wanting it instead of being punked by \"If you don't have anything to hide what's the problem.\"  Between DOXXING, mistaken identity, scammers, sim theft etc, people should NOT SHY AWAY FROM SAYING \"I'm not doing anything wrong, I have the presumption of innocence, F\\*CK OFF if you have a problem with that\"***",

Where can I learn about their intended uses, how their development is structured, and how decentralized they are?\n\nI'm also open to hear individual opinions on them, provided it's more than just \"\\_\\_\\_ is dumb because it's not Monero\" or \"I invested big in \\_\\_\\_ and you should too so we can go to the moon!\"",

Being an absolute stranger in the crypto world (and being someone coming from the arts, not from computer science), I didn't know anything about these subjects.\n\nHaving the curiosity about how everything works, I thought that maybe it can be better to read not only about technical subjects but also the history of money (to know about the whole evolution about currencies) and other things such as political views about it, or how cryptocurrencies can help to survive people from latinamerican and other countries that are f**** by authoritarian governments.\n\nAbout this last subject, I try to talk about it in a \"neutral\" way, by citing economic and political theories. For example, the State having no correct incentives \"for doing the right thing\" (and showing different cases in Latinamerica, where that leads \"naturally\" to corruption). Or, another thing I extensively wrote is about the fallacy of the broken window and the refutation of the argument about the State as the only entity capable of providing security (and the sophism that stipulate private security wilk lead to a mafia-like organizations)... All of these subjects, coming from the scenario where a community lives using Monero as a mean of exchange and eliminating the taxes (and also demonstrating about its coercive nature)",

In may of this year, due to several discussion in Twitter, I reviewed my work and I migrated it to LaTeX.\n\nSince I was facing this like a thesis, I add it the sources in APA form (trying to add as much references I had to be \"more serious\" in my approach), tables, formulas, and everything else...

                    "response": "These kinds of people are angry and fearful. You can see it in their writing. They're not interested in truth, or a raw technical evaluation. They're just trying to arrange words in a way that makes them feel better about their bags, and assauge that lingering doubt in their mind which is fearful of XMR. \n\nNonetheless, it's worthwhile to address these weak (and cliche) criticisms, because we don't want to leave a leg for ignorance to stand on. So here goes.\n\n\n### Yeah that's the altcoin with only 2,769 reachable nodes. (Bitcoin has over 50,000 nodes lol)\n\n1. It looks like we might have 10k to 12k nodes. https://monero.fail/map    \n2. These are just visible nodes, so likely we have quite a lot more behind firewalls.   \n3. But okay, Monero does an average of 23k txns/day, so that's about 12% ratio of nodes, to daily transactions. If we take the number at 10k nodes, it's more like 43%. BTC does about 250k txns/day, with say 50k nodes, so about a 20% ratio. In reality, these are estimates, but overall, Monero has a comparable amount of community participation in the node infrastructure as BTC, perhaps even more. \n\nBut also, so what? Can anyone articulate or demonstrate exactly what, and *how much* additional risk is posed by only having 10k nodes globally, vs 50k? Redundancy reaches a point of diminishing returns. If maxis claim BTC is ultra secure with 50k nodes, then would 500k nodes confer much more marginal benefit? The goal is censorship resistance, and 3-12k nodes (again, likely more) should already be very robust. \n\n### could have an inflation bug and nobody would know because you can't audit the supply.\n\nFalse. Mathematically false. The cryptography for hidden amounts, uses the same type of logarithmic hardness which we rely on for digital signatures. You can prove that the inputs - outputs = 0 , for any transaction, without revealing the amount. \n\nAnd if we already rely on these cryptographic primitives for signing/verifying signatures, then why wouldn't we also rely on it for shielding amounts? They're both indispensable parts of the protocol.\n\nBut going a step further, an exploited inflation bug is catastrophic for either chain. Even if you could stop BTC within a few blocks (but could be hours or longer), it would immediately lose the #1 spot, and never regain it. Forever disqualified from the running as a global monetary standard, and some other crypto(s) would fill that place. Given the consequences are the same either way, this isn't really a factor.    \n\n### 90% of its hashrate coming from mining malware\n\nThis is where the person really starts to reveal that they're less interested in an honest discussion, and more interested in spouting off attacks. We don't really know what that percentage is, but one of the devs estimates maybe 20%. While blackhats exploiting people's property is bad, this isn't a centralization issue. There's loads of indepenent black hats, so they're not just one monolithic entity. From a network standpoint, they play by the rules, and contribute hashpower. Believe it or not, there are still portscanning botnets from 20 years ago roaming the internet, because they literally can't be shutdown, without killing the internet. So from a network security standpoint, this is more of a benefit than anything.\n\n### That's why it's not really profitable for most people to mine XMR at home.\n\nAs always, it depends on your electricity costs, hardware, and strategy. If you have a nice 8-96 core processor that you use for other purposes, and only mine in your spare time, then your hardware cost is effectively zero. So if you have cheap electricity, or you're doubling that rig as a space heater, then yes, you're gonna get some modest profit. \n\nNo you're not going to be able to make a massively corporatized and centralized mining farm out of it, which you operate with a govt obtained business license and permission with massive electricity infrastructure that you have to pick up and move every few years because govts change their minds about *ALLOWING* you to continue operating. But that's a good thing, and a big weakness for BTC mining, which *WILL* get censored and permissioned via OFAC and govt compliance in the not distant future. The ground work is already laid.  \n\n### minexmr.com mining pool currently controls 35% of monero's hashrate\n\nA hypocritical criticism, where people are looking for ways to denigrate, rather than investigate. BTC also had periods of time with over 50% hashpower in a single pool. BTC currently has 60% of HP in just 4 pools. Are we really going to pretend that the potential for 4 BTC pools to collude for 51% attack, is anything more than marginally better than 2 pools colluding in Monero?\n\nIt's a disingenuous argument, a hypocritical one, that hasn't followed Sun Tsu's first rule: \"Know thyself\"\n\nBut moreover, the solution is P2Pool, which is being integrated into the GUI, to make it easy for people to use.\n\n### kraken.com and monero will probably eventually be taken off of kraken.com because of regulations\n\nHmm, that's an interesting argument. So what you're saying is that Monero has properties that make the existing power structures nervous enough to try and attack at the corporate onramps, but for *some* reason, they don't feel threatened by Bitcoin? In a world where govts are colluding to victimize their citizens en masse, while simultaneously embracing Bitcoin, that alone should be concerning to anyone who joined crypto for the digital freedom money aspects. \n\nBut okay, I guess if you're a bitch, and just resigned to only ever doing what your govt allows you to do, then okay, you win that one.\n\nOh wait, except for the fact that the lead regulator for all US banks (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) said last year that: \"all blockchains are permissible for banking purposes, *including ones with enhanced AML risks*\" (paraphrased). And of course, Jesse Powell, CEO of Kraken stating that they were under no regulator pressure from the US regarding Monero. And the fact that banks already deal in billions of dollars of cash, and that exchanges are moving closer towards obtaining banking licenses.\n\n### altcoin with a ton of bag holders because it just keeps losing value to BTC\n\nAh the good ole last resort argument. \"Your number is going to go down forever.\" How about we turn that argument around on Bitcoin, and talk about all the coins that *gained massive amounts of value* relative to BTC, both in this bull market, and also since their inception. Let see here, if you had bought: Eth, Doge, XRP, ADA, XLM, and yes, gasp MONERO at the launch of each of those projects, you'd still be up significantly relative to BTC. And of course this bull market, the massive outperformance of altcoins relative to BTC is clear. Hell, even Monero at the moment is at the same price relative to Bitcoin as it was 2 years ago. \n\n**Maxi:** But all of those shitcoins will die forever relative to BTC value. \n\nSorry homie, but that's not what the price charts are saying right now. Besides, you're not allowed to make a vague and uncertain appeal to the future to try and support your case now, because I could just as easily do the same. I understand that maxis want to cherry pick the top of the 2017/2018 markets because that's best for their case, but it seems more reasonable to look at projects over their lifetime, not just from the top of a mania bubble.\n\nOkay, so hopefully that gives you some things to go with. These conversations are tedious and difficult, because maxis are very practiced at regurgitating the talking points spoon fed to them by their cult leaders. They make very generic and broad distortions and misunderstandings of the real state of technology, Monero, markets, and principles; which can take some time to parse. As they say, it takes 10 times more effort to dismantle BS than it takes to create it. \n\nBut for Monero, which is properly adhering to the principles of digital freedom money, and making parasitic power structures nervous; it's worth the effort.",

(Bitcoin has over 50,000 nodes lol)\n\nYes a coin with 0,6% the market cap of Bitcoin has 5% the number of nodes BTC has.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And it's the altcoin that could have an inflation bug and nobody would know because you can't audit the supply.\n\nThat would be true if we couldn't audit the supply, [but in fact we can](https://web.getmonero.org/2020/01/17/auditability.html), and it's frequently done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And it's the altcoin that has over 90% of its hashrate coming from mining malware that is illegally installed on people's servers without their knowledge.\n\nWe don't know that and can't know that, since we have no way to know who mines. But that could be true too, not that it matters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That's why most of these criminals just use the minexmr.com\n\nWe don't know that. We can't know. Even if it was true it's not that big of a deal, 51% attacks can be seen and mitigated. We'll survive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And it's the altcoin that's only listed on one exchange that has USD/EUR on/off ramps. That exchange is kraken.com and monero will probably eventually be taken off of kraken.com because of regulations\n\nHe's incorrect that it's only on Kraken because it's also on Binance AFAIK, but it's true that Monero will quite possibly be delisted even more in the future, the government don't like it, so it will surely be banned some day. I don't see how that's an argument though, it's normal for a privacy coin.\n\nEven delisted it's easy to obtain though. Just buy BTC or LTC on any exchange then swap it on a non-KYC platform from [https://kycnot.me/](https://kycnot.me/) and you're good to go. Even in Australia or UK.",

If so, was there a big difference between v1.0 and v2.0 of CryptoNote? Did Monero specifically utilise v1.0 or v2.0? I stumbled upon the whitepaper of v2.0 written by Nicolas van Saberhagen, and I would like to quote some of the things he states which are pretty good to use for arguments within a paper to illustrate certain points of why, for instance, Bitcoin is bad compared to Monero.\r  \n\r  \nThe reason why I'm asking here is because after doing some digging, some people exclude CryptoNote and refer to Monero's privacy capability solely under \"ring signatures\" (which from what I've read, CryptoNote enables?) - so it's just confusing for me when people don't relate to CryptoNote and rather draw attention to only \"ring signatures\", as if Monero were to create it and implement it themselves.\r  \n\r  \nProbably just a simple misunderstanding from my side, but I just want to make sure.\r  \n\r  \nThanks.",

However, there are many different uses for cryptocurrency and the infrastructure built around them, and privacy isn't an integral part in many use cases. See Ethereum and Bitcoin, both of which are the opposite of private, but still have many uses despite their openness.",

Bitcoin imho is not a digital currency, it is a digital asset, maybe not even a digital commodity because a commodity should be fungible. The prefix \"Crypto\" only indicates that cryptography is used in the mix of technologies inside. HTTPS is crypto. So none of the things that use crypto miss the point of crypto, because crypto can serve different purposes . Now your actual question is, as far as I can assume. **Do all the other crypto-currencies that have to goal to be a form of digital cash miss the point, because they are not protecting the privacy of the parties involved in a transaction?** If that is the question then yes! Monero is as far as I can evaluate the only project that fulfills the five requirements of money, Divisibility, Fungiblity, Resilience, Verifiability and Mobility. Every other project in that field lacks or neglects one or more of these features. In the case of Bitcoin it is the ability to be fungible that is lacking, and that is a direct consequence of the none existing privacy of transactions. \n\nI clicked Yes, and your question is justified, but vague and populistic worded.  \npeace",

If bitcoins value goes up and no new coins will be mined, tx fees will go up, making people hesitant to move their coins, that leads to less profit for miners and therefor higher fees.

Because all this solid bitcoins turn to immobile concrete, then all this shiny digital asset will be so costly and so hard to move like your 3-room condo on the wrong side of the tracks.\n\nFor an asset to be considered a medium of exchange, liquidity (not the amount of units but their mobility) is essential and the hard cap will be counterproductive. \n\none has to put in consideration the continuous loss of coins (beside the wallets of Satoshi) people lose their keys or die and take the seed phrase to their graves, so the scarce concrete is deflationary and that is one more reason to hold and not to move it and \"bang\" tx fees go up again.\n\nI write this knowing that you know this, but these things have to be mentioned in public more often and more frequently, so sorry for hijacking the thread.\n\npeace",

For a business accepting BTC you could trivially find out their current amount of BTC is in that wallet and how much they sent as payment to distributors if they use the account or how much they charged other customers etc.\n\n>Monero solves this problem by taking the cryptography a step further and verifying consensus without revealing any transactional and balance information about anyone using it.  It is much closer to the current idea of fiat cash whereas transparent blockchain are more like your bank where everyone in the whole world is the bank\u2026. your spouse, your mom and dad, and your worst enemy.\n\n>Monero is constantly updated to maintain this footing of privacy versus people seeking to steal that personal information and so far is winning by leaps and bounds.  It\u2019s what BTC was meant to be in terms of the white paper imo.",

Despite trying to research this point and the relationship between hashrate and energy consumption, I couldn't really find anything significant and just presumed the two were linked. \n\nAs I understand it now; due to RandomX, we get fewer hashes per second. But the consumption of electricity to get 1000 H/s for Monero could probably get you 100MHz if you were doing it for Bitcoin. So the while the hashrate might indicate the total power consumption for a blockchain, it depends on the hashing algorithm and also the hardware being used. So a lot of factors prevent hashrate being converted into energy consumption, and particularly so when comparing hashrate for different cryptocurrencies.\n\nIs that right?",

Starting from 2015, 75% of real bitcoin volume has been linked to exchanges or exchange-like entities such as on-line wallets, OTC desks, and large institutional traders. In contrast, other known entities are only responsible for a minor part of total volume. For example, illegal transactions, scams and gambling together make up less than 3% of volume.

As a decentralized protocol itself it is extremely to ban. The government will not try to waste time on fighting with thousands of monero nodes across the world or try to arrest the devs and plant backdoors, it will kill crypto using the cheapest and easiest way for it which is administration orders and regulations.\n\nThe government has very little power in crypto space, however the government can easily control the traditional fiat gateways and tools. No matter how secure and anonymous crypto is, people always need to cash out, and this conversion channel can be easily killed by the government. Once this channel is dead or hard enough for normal people to access, crypto is doomed or almost useless because what you can do with your crypto is highly limited.\n\nThe example is China. CCP has successfuly built a highly sophisticated surveillance nightmare that even Snowden cannot imagine. All online fiat payment tools are under strict KYC regulations which means mandatory facial recognition + bank account verification(you need to physically go to a bank to open an account which is almost impossible to counterfeit). Techniques used for fighting credit card fraud is well utilised here, it will mercilessly kill any login attempt that seems suspicious. A login attempt from labeled anonymous proxies will instantly kill the account, and other suspicious activities like attempt to start the software in vm or sort of thing will also raise fraud score and might leads to account suspension in the future. If the account is suspended it is very unlikely to recover access. The AML is also insane, especially crypto trading will trigger AML alert very easily. The police has a skynet like database which has the information of everyone's online activities including all the accounts(almost all accounts requires KYC because all registrations require phone number and phone number has bank account level KYC), contacts and transaction relationships. It is very easy for the police to map the crypto related accounts and label them as dangerous(sometimes the police even disguise as p2p traders to find out who is buying crypto). When enough AML alerts are triggered a person's all online accounts can be frozen together and becomes digitally dead, which means you cannot pay for train ticks, rent a house and need to use cash for eating out. This 1984 style regulation is powerful enough to deter 95% of people from using any crypto.\n\nAlso no need to mention it is illegal for merchants to accept crypto, so direct crypto payment also do not work. Finally the government has network surveillance on provincial routers and national GFW. It detects any crypto related network activity and disconnect them from the Internet, my friend is banned from using network and called by the police because he tried to mine using his gaming GPU at home. Even it is not possible to kill all the offshore node servers, they can be easily blocked plus using an active firewall that probes all the potential proxy servers and kill vpns to further increase the cost of settings up a working crypto wallet.\n\nIt is impossible to fight the government with simply some  Internet tools, a political problem needs a political solution, since the government ultimately controls the ISP and financial infrastructure and can block access.It is just a cost problem for them not to block something. The problem is democratic system fails to restrict the power greedy government and the old western liberty dies out. It should be solved by figuring out how to properly regulate the power itself.",

                            "response": "You're on the right line of thinking. I'll try to supplement with what I believe is the technically correct answer.\n\nAny exchange that wants to manipulate prices over the long term, needs to be the exchange with the highest real volume, or needs to collude with multiple exchanges to have the highest real volume combined.\n\nOtherwise, what happens is that as they try to suppress price and force it down with fake sells on their platforms, other exchanges acting honestly, don't have commensurate XMR sells on their platforms. So price drops on the lying exchange, and stays the same on honest exchanges (maybe even goes up).\n\n Then arbitrators come in to even out the price, and the exchange who runs out of liquidity first, is forced to end up pegging to the exchange with higher real volume. Either that, or if they're *really* deadset on suppressing price, they can eat the arbitration loss themselves, but it costs them money to do so.\n\nSo for example, let's say that users on Binance are leaving, withdrawing their XMR. Binance is now low on liquidity to meet withdraws. Meanwhile, lets say that people are buying on Kraken, and price is rising over there, but Binance is rigging their prices, just saying that the price is lower.\n\nNow the arbitrators come in and try to withdraw cheap XMR from Binance, to sell at a higher price on Kraken and pocket the difference. If Binance (and their cohorts at Poloniex, Bitfinex, et al), can't come up with the Monero to meet withdraw demand, then Binance loses, then one of two things happens. \n\nEither they peg their price to Kraken, and start buying Monero at an even higher price, to continue meeting customer demand, or they freeze withdraws. In which case, no one regards their price as accurate or reliable. You might see a price divergence develop, especially on places like Bisq, Havano, Kraken, etc. There might be faku volume, but they progressively erode themselves into XMR irrelevance. No genuine DEX, CEX, or individual will accept a lower quote from Binance, when they can get a better price elsewhere.\n\nSo hopefully that illustrates why the exchange(s) with higher real (honest) volume end up setting the price.\n\nWhich is why we're making this big push. If we can get enough people off these fractional reserve exchanges, we might get some positive price discovery. The trick that Binance and others have used, is the fact that probably only a fraction of people ever withdraw their XMR at any given time. \n\nIt means they can sell a claim on XMR that doesn't exist, without having reduced the supply of real Monero on the open market.\n\n If we can get enough people to call their bluff, and just withdraw what they already bought, probably many months ago, then yes, we're essentially successful on what will probably look like a multi phase approach. \n\nPhase two will be for us to populate the upcoming DEXes with real volume and liquidity, maybe combined with another Monerun push.",

Opportunity cost is real. You have no guarantee whether they will *ever* pay you back. \n\nIn other words, their naked short stays OPEN, and keeps price suppressed. Because until the moment they actually buy real XMR to pay the customer (maybe never), it never gets reflected in price.\n\n\n\nAnd the higher the price, the more painful it is for them to make good on the claim. And furthermore, you're withdrawing at least *some real* liquidity off their platform.\n\nYou have to realize that these guys live and die by liquidity, real funds on their exchange. \n\nBut the easiest most fundamental way you can know that what Im saying is right...  Leaving your funds in a place that is lying to you and doesn't actually custody the assets they promised, is insane. Why on Earth would you voluntarily do business with someone you *know* is actively defrading you??",

I was spreading the word far and wide back in 2011 when I bought my first Bitcoin.  I was one of the \u201ccrazy\u201d ones.  Where I think we may diverge is whether Monero can stand out among all of the noise\u2026and there is A LOT of that. \n\nStanding out among the noise is literally the point of marketing. If we want wider adoption, then we have to tell people why they should adopt it. In the status quo, the privacy aspect seems to be pumped more than any other, but Monero is much more than that. It is far superior to the most widely adopted crypto-commodity, Bitcoin, in many ways and that needs to be effectively communicated.\n\nJust my thoughts\u2026",

It seems almost impossible for software to achieve real randomness without any human random input (dice rolls ect).  What exactly is generating random numbers because it has to be based on something?  I know for the electrum wallet, its based on the random function in a python library.  \n\n\nEDIT: Might have found the answer in this article.  \nhttps://medium.com/@brandonarvanaghi/analyzing-trezor-firmware-mnemonic-seed-generation-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-4b03fbaad24d",

The problem is society is just now starting to accept Bitcoin, barely. The main hurdle now is getting people to accept the consensus mechanism of both Bitcoin and Monero. \n\nI saw some individuals reference the dark markets. I think that's a good representation of how this will progress. The dark markets and users have historically been the first to adopt new technologies regarding privacy and security. They started with Bitcoin back with the silk road. As time went on we've seen most of them move primarily to Monero as their primary method of exchange. I think this is what we'll see on a large scale with the rest of society. \n\nOnce Bitcoin is commonplace, people will see its primary flaw. Its public ledger of transactions. When this becomes a problem people will look for a solution. That will be Moneros time to shine. \n\nFor now, though, I think we need to be united with the Bitcoin community. There is already so much division in the crypto space, rightfully so. I believe though that the Monero and Bitcoin communities are largely fighting for the same thing and that division among us will weaken our stance at this very important point in time. When the dominance of PoW is insured, I believe that's when we should have this discussion among our communities.",

You'll soon learn, though, that market making comes with its own costs. You have to wait around for someone to respond to your ad (and they might not want to sell the full amount that you proposed). You have to deal with scammers trying to trick you into paying for no XMR. You have to build a reputation to be seen at the top of the list. \n\nI recommend connecting a telegram account so that you can be notified when someone responds to your ad.

So what they do is take the probability that the tagged output is included as a decoy in an average transaction (very low), subtract that from 100, and use that as their answer (99.99%+). That's not the actual probability though, because \"the chance of the tagged output being picked as a decoy\" is a completely incorrect question to begin with. It assumes that the exchange already knows, for certain, that those particular funds were later re-deposited onto the exchange by the dealer, in which case the entire argument is irrelevant.\n\nYou have to consider *all of the other outputs* *selected* as possible sources of the funds. So it technically could've come from that output, but it is equally likely that it came from any of 120 others. And also the fact that there are going to be several other transactions using the output as a decoy, plus several more using the outputs from *those* transactions, means that it quickly becomes impossible to determine where the funds actually went. Or if they moved at all.\n\nThe author is either a complete moron or is knowingly lying in order to slander Monero. Maybe both.",

I suppose it depends on the bank, payment provider, jurisdiction etc.\n\nFor example maybe you have a bank account registered to an entity other than yourself eg company, non profit etc. Or maybe you are using a fintech payment provider that does not ask for KYC for volume under a certain amount.\n\nBisq relies on the fact that even if u/pazza83 and u/FamousM1 traded on Bisq though our bank accounts. We would both know details about what the fiat was exchanged for, but the banks would just see it as a transfer from one to the other. The only people that know it was a trade is ourselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Everyone here recommends bisq for non KYC stuff but I've never seen anyone talk about those non KYC options like Cash by Mail\n\nI think the benefit is what ever payment method is used only the peers know what the trade is for. \n\nSome traders have higher privacy requirements, or are 'unbanked', and, therefore, opt for payment methods that do not even need a bank or payment facility.",

Advertisements are for commercial products or services and Monero isn't that.\n\nThis propaganda is using [psychological reactance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4675534/) to automatically make the reader feel like they want to do the opposite. There are [plenty of examples](https://wizardofads.org/reverse-psychology-and-advertising-strategy/) of advertisements making use of this technique. A recent successful example is Patagonia using it in 2011; after this campaign they [quadrupled their sales estimates](https://bettermarketing.pub/dont-buy-this-jacket-patagonia-s-daring-campaign-2b37e145046b).\n\nFor people who don't know what Monero is and don't care to read the fine print, this is designed to act like a subconscious psychological reactance seed. For those who are hooked enough to read, it makes the reader question how some grassroots computer nerd movement could possibly weaken banks and states, two of the most powerful forces in our society.\n\nI've always liked it for this clever multi-pronged approach. All that said, there are probably better iterations of this that better fit with these times. Cryptocurrency has become more and more a part of the common vernacular so the point you made:\n\n>there's nothing in it to differentiate it from other cryptocurrencies\n\nmeans reduced positive impact on Monero by this propaganda every day.\n\n>even I could come up with something better than this.\n\nDo it, seriously. Then make a graphic and post it on the internet and see how effectively it spreads. If you find a winner make stickers and give them out. [Here's my attempt](https://i.imgur.com/5l8wAXn.png) at a version that still uses the original multi-pronged technique.\n\n\ud83e\udd18\ud83d\udc3a\ud83e\udd18",

Reverse psychology is sometimes referred to as\u00a0psychological reactance, which is the aroused state that occurs when a freedom is threatened or eliminated. The higher stake or more freedoms that are threatened, the more arousal that can be expected. People prefer to be free to select what they like. so when that freedom is taken away, they are motivated to restore it. Psychological reactance can be better explained as the idea that an item will be wanted more if people are told they cannot have it, which can relate to reverse psychology on some levels. Another influence technique that relates to reverse psychology is strategic self-anticonformity. Strategic self-anticonformity is when a person advocates a position that is opposite of their true thought, while hiding the fact that they are using a persuasion tactic. A common example of such is marketing techniques or tricks such as \"do not click this link,\" or \"do not push this button.\" Strategic self-anticonformity and psychological reactance relate in their expected negativity or disagreeableness from their influence target.\n\n- Wikipedia \n\nI know Wikipedia cannot be trusted for most information, so below is a more educational article.\n\n50 year review of psychological reactance theory: Do not read this article\n\nhttps://scholar.dominican.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=psychology-faculty-scholarship\n\nI recommend looking into this to get a better idea of how the \"Don't buy Monero\" advertisement is supposed to work.

This impact is what makes someone more likely to look up the project and do their own research.\n\n**Appeal to og crypto ideologists**\n\nThere is a reason bitcoin was revolutionary when it came out. It was peer to peer digital money. The power it held was in an alternative from of money that could be used online without a third party needed. It's power never came from the establishment and banks backing it as their investment, it's true potential power was in creating an alternative system that would be more fair than the monopoly that central banks currently held and abused at the expense of most people. \n\nThis idea is what brought about most of the early users of bitcoin. It is still the same value proposition that bitcoin holds but it has been watered down as nothing more than marketing material for selling financial products around bitcoin. The thing is, there are still people looking for what bitcoin promised as the future in the early days. This ad targets those users and forces them to look into doing their own research. Which is all that Monero ads should strive for. \n\n**I would make one change**\nI would change \"cryptocurrencies\" and change it to \"anonymous money\". This can help bring to light the privacy issues you have talked about in your post. \n\nI think if you want to bring to light the tracking of users then more effective marketing campaign is in actively showing how easy it is to trace and correlate user activity to an address on public blockchains. Marketing materials then could be stickers that show something like \n\"What does your address say about you?\" \n\"CryptoTrackerlink\"\n\nThen you can show how that data is correlated and offer monero as the solution",

                    "response": "These are not at all dumb questions\n\n> Is there any advantage to using the GUI wallet on a Ledger instead of just keeping it on my desktop?\n\nFirst and foremost, keep a physical copy of your **Monero** wallet mneomnic seed phrase on paper (or metal, etc). You can *always* recover with that phrase. With the 12(?) word Ledger wallet, you still depend on Ledger and its hardware -- not the Monero blockchain directly.\n\nPersonally I don't use Ledger, it's just more hardware that can go wrong and is an increased attack surface. I keep a \"cold\"/paper wallet for savings, and for transactions I keep a wallet (ie, the wallet files) on a removable drive that I plug in only while actually transacting. IMO just as good physical security (arguably even better, since it's a LUKS encrypted partition) and trivially easy for me to back up.\n\n> Can my everyday MacBook Pro run the GUI or does the blockchain take enormous amounts of memory?\n\nI haven't run the GUI on a MacBook so can't confirm. But the on-disk blockchain is ~130 GB; with sharding, around a third of that. RAM requirements even for the GUI should not be a concern.\n\nYou can also use \"simple mode\" which uses a remote node and therefore does not download the whole blockchain. An adversarial remove node is theoretically possible; you may wish to use a Tor remote node to ensure you can't be denonymized (see https://monero.fail for public nodes)\n\n> the funds become anonymous again once they're out of the CEX?\n\nThe finds become anonymous as soon as they hit your private self-hosted wallet. As others have noted, the address you withdraw to from the CEX will be known to the CEX (else they could not send you the funds), but knowing that address does not give away how much you have, where you got it, or where you subsequently spend it. You might want to give the CEX a subaddress that you only use for that CEX, or if the CEX doesn't support withdraw to a subaddress, do a subsequent transfer to a second wallet whose address the CEX does not know.",

                    "response": "So there are 2 main options for getting Monero. \n\nFirst is to convert directly to Monero with USD. You can use [localmonero](https://localmonero.co/) as a p2p method, or there are a few CEXs that you can buy from (such as KuCoin which you mentioned). Just make sure that you trust the CEX and that it will work for what you're trying to do.\n\nSecond is to convert from another cryptocurrency. Litecoin & BitcoinCash are good options because they both have low fees, are widely accepted, and can be obtained much more easily from a CEX than Monero. From there, you can easily swap those for Monero. Check out [kycnot.me](https://kycnot.me) for a bunch of options.\n\n>Is there any advantage to using the GUI wallet on a Ledger instead of just keeping it on my desktop?\n\nYes, a hardware wallet is more secure. A software wallet can be plenty secure too, though, if you take the proper precautions and know what you're doing. But if it's going to be on your regular desktop, then a hardware wallet is a must-have.\n\n>Can my everyday MacBook Pro run the GUI or does the blockchain take enormous amounts of memory?\n\nWell the entire blockchain is more than 100 gb, but it's kept on the hard drive as opposed to memory, and you don't even need to download it to use Monero. When setting up the GUI, use \"Simple Mode\", which connects to other nodes instead of you having to download the blockchain yourself. A full node (with the blockchain downloaded) is generally preferable, but it's not the end of the world if you don't.\n\nLong story short, yes, any reasonably modern computer can run the GUI wallet.\n\n>If i buy Monero with USD on KuCoin and transfer to the GUI wallet, is the privacy aspect destroyed at the gate or do the funds become anonymous again once they're out of the CEX?\n\nThe exchange will only be aware of the transaction which they sent your Monero through. After that, they won't know anything.",

Essentially integrated addresses and subaddress do not currently have perfectly overlapping features and it's not appropriate to deprecate integrated until that happens... The biggest problem is that your spend key wallet will have no idea a subaddress transaction at index 13393493939349 ever occurred. So if I have an employee collecting payments on the other side of the world using random subaddresses, my wallet won't know they happened.  Currently, the payment collector HAS to know which subaddresses have already been used and this is a no go for something like HotBox that needs to know nothing about which addresses have been used (every payment id/integrated address is unique and will be detected by the spend key main wallet).  I gave my thoughts on this a few days ago in the relevant Github issue: https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/7889#issuecomment-1088218118",

In theory, if you say bought drugs with it, you are supposed to report it, or, when you get caught it will be an additional charge.   \n\nAs an anecdote, I had to renew my bank agreement recently and one of the questions was 'What's the average value you intend to withdraw in cash monthly and for what purpose?'.    \n\nIt's getting totalitarian here.   I have trading XMR and deep hold XMR and I can see a future where the deep hold stuff can't easily be brought back into my economy.   If so, well, I'll have to spend it in a different economy.. e.g. swap to BTC and withdraw cash in some place that has those machines.   \n\nIf that's the future I will insist on XMR payments from a few clients I have that simply could not survive without me.

Not yet, anyway. But I would say that's not a Monero thing: I think that does not exist anywhere else either, at least not at the moment.\n\nFull privacy the way I understand your question takes knowledge and determination.

However, simpler to use wallets with smoother user experience especially for scanning / updating your wallet / balance come at a certain cost of privacy you disclose to the wallet developer.\n\nUnlike in Bitcoin, its forks and most other cryptocurrencies, one XMR is indistinguishable from another XMR. There are no tainted coins, there is no chain analysis and an address actually never lands on the blockchain.\n\nMonero also offers a solution for sustainable scalability without having a fixed set block size but a dynamic one which is ruled by demand starting at 300kB every 2 minutes but can be increased by miners in change of (part of) their block reward. This is however limited by the median of the last 100 and 10,000 blocks, so there has to be >50% consensus amongst miners - and incentive by users and tx fees - to increase the block size, otherwise median will not increase. However, after the base block size increased, (minimum) fees decrease, since they are counted against the block reward divided by current block size.\n\nMonero has a Tail Emission which will kick in in about two months from now and will be forever 0.6 XMR per block / 0.3 XMR per minute. This ensures not only the above dynamic block size / dynamic fee algorithms to work, but especially it ensures an upholding incentive for miners to mine even when there is no demand for transactions on the blockchain.\n\nYou will find much more, if you dig deeper, but that are the main features of Monero making it actually money or a digital version of cash (however even better, since no serial numbers attached).",

                    "response": "This is the way!\n\n>\nCrypto\nHome/Crypto\n\nThank you for your interest in crypto currency and Helicon Brewing!\n\nWe have created this FAQ to address questions of any potential crypto customers. If you have a question or concern that is not addressed below, please let us know! Questions and comments can be emailed to crypto@heliconbrewing.com.\n\nQ: How does paying a bill work?\n\nA: Paying with cryptocurrency at Helicon Brewing is easier than paying with a credit card. When the time comes to pay your bill, simply let the bartender know that you would like to pay with crypto and the crypto type; for example, Monero (XMR). The bartender will generate a receipt showing the amount of the chosen cryptocurrency due and a QR code for the deposit address. You will then deposit the amount due at the printed deposit address. After a brief interval, the length of which depends upon the type of cryptocurrency used, the bartender will get a notification of the deposit and close out the bar tab.\n\nQ: How does tipping work?\n\nA: The printed receipt will show the amount of crypto owed to pay the bill and will also show some suggested tip percentage amounts. Any amount of overpayment above the total due will automatically become a tip for the staff.\n\nQ: Does it cost anything to pay with cryptocurrency?\n\nA: It is actually cheaper to pay with cryptocurrency! To incentivize our guests to consider paying with cryptocurrency, we apply a 2% discount to all purchases made with cryptocurrency. The transaction fees are paid by the customer\u2013these are based on the type of cryptocurrency and are usually very small.\n\nQ: Which cryptocurrencies do you currently accept?\n\nA: At this time we accept Monero (XMR), Ripple (XRP), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Nano (NANO), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Dash (DASH), Litecoin (LTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nQ: Will you consider ever accepting <insert unsupported crypto type here>?\n\nA: Maybe! Adding a new cryptocurrency to our list is trivial. The one limitation is that we can only accept cryptocurrencies supported by Kraken. If you have a cryptocurrency that you are looking to spend, please let us know!\n\nQ: Why do you use Kraken?\n\n1) They support the cryptocurrency Monero.\n\n2) They are by all accounts the most reputable and fair exchange that exists today with among the lowest transaction fees and minimum deposit requirements.\n\n3) Their API to access deposit information is key to this all working. It is possible that Binance or other exchanges will be added in the future.\n\nQ: What program are you using to accept cryptocurrency payments?\n\nA: The owner of Helicon Brewing, Chris Brunetti, was a software developer before opening the brewery. He has written the entirety of the code himself.\n\nQ: Can my business be set up to accept cryptocurrency?\n\nA: Yes! We need some time to fully stress test the code. Once it is ready, it should be straightforward to get new businesses set up. If you would like to be added to our list of businesses interested in accepting cryptocurrency payments, please email us at crypto@heliconbrewing.com.\n\nQ: How is the exchange rate for cryptocurrency payments determined?\n\nA: At the time the request is made to pay the bill, the software obtains the current \u201cask\u201d price from Kraken. This rate is printed on each bill. If the customer is unhappy with the rate, they may choose instead to pay with cash or a card. Helicon Brewing reserves the right to not accept a particular cryptocurrency for any reason most notably if it is a volatile day.\n\nQ: What do you do with your cryptocurrency you receive as payments?\n\nA: We cash out the vast majority of the crypto we receive every evening and use it to pay our bills. Except for Monero\u2013we transfer that to our Trezor Model T conveniently located on our boat.\n\nQ: You mention Monero a lot, why?\n\nA: We believe that when the dust settles, the scams are over, the rug pulls are done, and adoption is significant, Monero will be the best and most popular cryptocurrency out there. The details are beyond the scope of this FAQ, but we\u2019d love it if you stopped in to talk about it!",

Monero puts into the hands of the average person powers currently only available to the rich elite--such as the ability to have effective financial privacy. It also removes from the power of elites the ability to confiscate wealth at the push of a button via freezing bank accounts.\n\nDistributing that power out to the average person removes the worst excesses of power that the self-serving might use.\n\nIn other words, for whatever fears you might have about people misusing crypto and Monero in particular, you should be much more worried about the people running the game right now. They're the same species of human as you or me but have disproportionate power in the current system, and cause harm with it every single day.",

The problem is the fees.\n\nI supposed a dedicated service could be made that processes the card, then sends you crypto. The problem is that the third party will still have to pay exchange fees, then they take their cut. So everytime you accept this method as payment, you are probably going to lose at least 5-10% in fees",

Sadly, the majority does really not care that much about it.\n\nRather, crypto is attractive because of more practical reasons.  \na) Limited supply. In many countries we see high inflation of fiat money, which scares people who have something to lose.  \nb) Less bureaucracy. Easy account creation, no account fees, relatively fast and unlimited transaction amounts.  \nc) Censorship resistance. No third party can close your account or freeze your wallet. As long as you have your keys, you have financial freedom.\n\nIf we are talking about mass adoption, I think privacy plays mostly an indirect role.",

I don't blame him for holding onto the idea that Bitcoin can be better. But it's nice to see an OG who understands why crypto currency is important acknowledge and praise Moneros pros over Bitcoin when he is very careful not to give credit to the various coins that come and go.\n\nedit: also I may have misunderstood it but from my watching of the video he said Monero is an order of magnitude more private than Bitcoin and if you need to be private from governments than you should use Monero. The one pro Bitcoin has over Monero is Liquidity and market cap. Monero is only 3 Billion Market Cap so it can be hard to move large amounts of money. Now that wont always be the case but if you needed to move money today its good to evaluate the privacy trade offs with possible liquidity issues. I don't think anyone here would disagree with that.",

There was a couple years where some maxi ideas held some water, even if they weren't water tight. Kinda like metaphorical truth, if you pretend like everything else is a scam, you're less likely to get scammed. \n\nBut those days are over, and with the hindsight of 20/20, we can see the problems, compromises, and failings piling up. It's still minimally viable for certain things. but it's anyone's guess how much that will degrade in coming years.\n\nRegarding anonymity set vs privacy, if I heard him correctly, he said that BTC has a large anonymity set because of the greater adoption, but that Monero has technologically better privacy protections in the protocol.\n\nThe problem of course is that almost no one uses coinjoin or any privacy practices at all in Bitcoin, those methods have all shown to be quite deficient, and it's hard to say that Bitcoin has any real anonymity set at all, simply because any anonymity set that you might try to count, all have significantly, multilple orders of magnitude weaker obfuscation than Monero. \n\nSo it's hard to make a good apples/apples comparison. But in reality, if I'm not mistaken, even just the hard numbers of Bitcoin transactions made with a pseudo-anonymity protocol are dwarfed by the number of trasactions happening on the Monero blockchain.\n\nAnd Aantop doesn't bother with discussing any of that nuance, and then makes just blatantly inaccurate statements regarding this simple topic, with an obvious agenda of steering people away from Monero. \n\n I kinda take this video as a nice little picture perfect reason of why I used to like and listen to him, and now I don't",

Gold is up significantly from only a few years back, too.\n\nIt's all a function of supply/demand. Monero's supply will eventually inflate asymptotically to zero, meaning that if adoption grows, the demand per unit grows, and the the price will go up.\n\nAlso, since value is measured by trade with other goods, and currencies are the primary trade goods, inflation can drive up price by virtue of the fact that more currency is moving around.\n\nMonero's price has been more stable than other cryptos because its demand growth has been steady rather than explosive-- likely because it doesn't advertise itself as a way to get rich and users only find out about it after having been in crypto for a while and having realized the limitations of their favorite coin. Couple that with predictable supply growth and you end up with a relatively stable price.",

With current mcap it is absolutely impossible to buy something worth more than 3.5 bil using monero, and that would mean every coin is used in this transaction. Now, Charles de Gaulle is a french aircraft carrier that cost around 3.7 bil usd, it barely can't be bought with monero. And George HW Bush carrier (6.26 bil) or indian Vikrant (10 bil) are things that had to be bought, but there are not enough coins in monero ecosystem to pay for them. Monero will not be proper currency if some things just can't be bought with it, and things won't magically get priced in monero just because we want them to be, if they can't be bought with it.\n\nNow, wy do we care about aircraft carriers? Can't they be bought in USD while we pay for stuff in xmr, some may ask.\n\nWell, they are paid for using tax money, and tax is paid in the currency a trade was executed in, so if we pay for stuff monero then gov will probably be getting monero as tax. Why would they allow things to be priced in monero if they still have to sell what they get from taxes to be able to buy stuff? Easier to force people to pay taxes in USD. So people pay taxes in USD, and pay for things in monero, but why pay in monero, if that means show owners will earn in monero and will pay their employees in monero, while they have to pay taxes in USD... Easier to just use USD until we can replace it entirely. And for monero to be able to replace USD entirely it has to do at least a 1000x.\n\n(Using USD as that is the currency that most volume is settled in, not because I don't know there are any other, I'm from eu)",

As far as personal usage, I rarely read the Monero Moon.  When I do though, every time it is has been because I had been busy for a bit and not consuming xmr related content. For my use case, I have found the Monero Moon to be well curated and informative, but I only sometimes feel I have a need for Monero Moon in its current form.  That being said, I have never read any of the alternative daily news letters more than once.  I feel like I can catch myself up on my own if I miss a day of Monero related content, but not a week.",

                    "response": "Always glad to see ArticMine keeping up with the legislative activity. Here are the big takeaways that I got from reading this proposed bill:\n\n> FACILITATOR. \u2014 The term \u2018\u2018digital asset transaction facilitator\u2019\u2019 means    \n> (A) any person, or group of persons, that significantly and materially facilitates the purchase, sale, lending, borrowing, exchange, custody, holding, validation, or creation of digital assets on the account of others, including any communication protocol, decentralized finance technology, smart contract, or other software, including open-source computer code     \n> (i) deployed through the use of distributed ledger or any similar technology; and    \n> (ii) that provides a mechanism for multiple users to purchase, sell, lend, borrow, or trade digital assets; and    \n> (B) any person, or group of persons, that the Secretary of the Treasury otherwise determines to be significantly and materially facilitating digital assets transactions in violation of sanctions   \n\nBasically they propose to sanction anyone acting in this capacity. So this is relatively easy to break down, since it's not a long bill.\n\nNotice the key phrases:\n- \"digital asset transaction facilitator\"\n- \"significantly and materially facilitates the ... validation, or creation of digital assets\"\n- \"including any communication protocol, including open-source computer code\"\n\nSurprisingly, they're actually using the right language here. Specific and accurate. This puts ASIC miners of surveillance chains directly in the crosshairs, *exactly* like we said was going to happen, ever since Marathon Digital took their first swing at OFAC compliant hashpower; and China forced a supermajority of hashrate into wester jurisdictions. \n\nThey even mention the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the last paragraph.\n\nThe one thing that might seem slightly less clear is whether developers and publishers of open code are included in this. I say no, absolutely not, even though the language would seem to maybe suggest that at first glance. Problem #1 is that such a bill would contradict decades of jurisprudence on the matter, and a vaguely worded prohibition of freedom of the press is not enough to overcome that, in any way shape or form. But second, okay, let's play language slueths ...\n\nThese actions: *purchase, sale, lending, borrowing, exchange, custody, holding, validation, or creation of digital assets* \n\nAre the actions required to be categorized as a \"FACILITATOR\"\n\nThese nouns: *communication protocol, decentralized finance technology, smart contract, or other software, including open-source computer code* \n\nAre the medium by which \"FACILITATORS\" conduct their actions. It's an inclusionary list, implying that, the medium is irrelevant to the actions listed previously. In other words, if you're doing those actions, even if on a decentralized finacial protocol, you will still be subject to their ~~fuckery~~ laws. \n\nAt least, that's how I interpret that. It's not forbidding the mere publishing of code, but rather the *execution of code* on behalf of sanctioned entities.\n\nIt's of course still pretty bad. Because of the irrevocabale flaws in Bitcoin and basically all protocols, it means that that forced OFAC compliant miners are headed straight for surveillance chains. As usual, Monero unaffected. \n\nu/ArticMine, what do you think about that interpretation?",

                            "response": "Here are some of my thoughts. \n\n> This puts ASIC miners of surveillance chains directly in the crosshairs, exactly like we said was going to happen, ever since Marathon Digital took their first swing at OFAC compliant hashpower; and China forced a supermajority of hashrate into wester jurisdictions. \n\nIt also opens the door to false accusations against those who are unrelated to the sanctions because blockchain surveillance (BS) is far from accurate. False negatives and positives are the rule rather than the exception when using BS. My view is that the biggest impact will be on the mining pools if they are centralized regardless of the type of mining used (ASIC, GPU, CPU etc). Also proof of stake tokens will also be impacted. We must keep in mind here that the absence of good privacy and fungibility does not mean good surveillance.  \n\n> Are the actions required to be categorized as a \"FACILITATOR\"\n\n> These nouns: *communication protocol, decentralized finance technology, smart contract, or other software, including open-source computer code*\n\n> Are the medium by which \"FACILITATORS\" conduct their actions.

As long as one avoids the trading of Monero for tokens, such as Bitcoin where the illusion of BS is possible, outside of a reputable AML / KYC exchange then yes, Monero is unaffected.",

As far as I know there is no really simple automated and turnkey way yet to receive Monero payments. It's cetainly not merely knowing \"what command lines to use\" with `monero-wallet-cli` and/or `monero-wallet-rpc`. The former is interactive only, and the latter can only serve as a backend and cannot handle payments all on its own.\n\nIf you are determined you may start your journey into Monero at [Monero Integrations](https://github.com/monero-integrations).",

                    "response": "TLDR Monero and related private tools will fail if the government is totalitarian and motivated enough to do this. As a decentralized protocol itself it is extremely to ban. The government will not try to waste time on fighting with thousands of monero nodes across the world or try to arrest the devs and plant backdoors, it will kill crypto using the cheapest and easiest way for it which is administration orders and regulations.\n\nThe government has very little power in crypto space, however the government can easily control the traditional fiat gateways and tools. No matter how secure and anonymous crypto is, people always need to cash out, and this conversion channel can be easily killed by the government. Once this channel is dead or hard enough for normal people to access, crypto is doomed or almost useless because what you can do with your crypto is highly limited.\n\nThe example is China. CCP has successfuly built a highly sophisticated surveillance nightmare that even Snowden cannot imagine. All online fiat payment tools are under strict KYC regulations which means mandatory facial recognition + bank account verification(you need to physically go to a bank to open an account which is almost impossible to counterfeit). Techniques used for fighting credit card fraud is well utilised here, it will mercilessly kill any login attempt that seems suspicious. A login attempt from labeled anonymous proxies will instantly kill the account, and other suspicious activities like attempt to start the software in vm or sort of thing will also raise fraud score and might leads to account suspension in the future. If the account is suspended it is very unlikely to recover access. The AML is also insane, especially crypto trading will trigger AML alert very easily. The police has a skynet like database which has the information of everyone's online activities including all the accounts(almost all accounts requires KYC because all registrations require phone number and phone number has bank account level KYC), contacts and transaction relationships. It is very easy for the police to map the crypto related accounts and label them as dangerous(sometimes the police even disguise as p2p traders to find out who is buying crypto). When enough AML alerts are triggered a person's all online accounts can be frozen together and becomes digitally dead, which means you cannot pay for train ticks, rent a house and need to use cash for eating out. This 1984 style regulation is powerful enough to deter 95% of people from using any crypto.\n\nAlso no need to mention it is illegal for merchants to accept crypto, so direct crypto payment also do not work. Finally the government has network surveillance on provincial routers and national GFW. It detects any crypto related network activity and disconnect them from the Internet, my friend is banned from using network and called by the police because he tried to mine using his gaming GPU at home. Even it is not possible to kill all the offshore node servers, they can be easily blocked plus using an active firewall that probes all the potential proxy servers and kill vpns to further increase the cost of settings up a working crypto wallet.\n\nIt is impossible to fight the government with simply some  Internet tools, a political problem needs a political solution, since the government ultimately controls the ISP and financial infrastructure and can block access.It is just a cost problem for them not to block something. The problem is democratic system fails to restrict the power greedy government and the old western liberty dies out. It should be solved by figuring out how to properly regulate the power itself.",

If so, was there a big difference between v1.0 and v2.0 of CryptoNote? Did Monero specifically utilise v1.0 or v2.0? I stumbled upon the whitepaper of v2.0 written by Nicolas van Saberhagen, and I would like to quote some of the things he states which are pretty good to use for arguments within a paper to illustrate certain points of why, for instance, Bitcoin is bad compared to Monero.\r  \n\r  \nThe reason why I'm asking here is because after doing some digging, some people exclude CryptoNote and refer to Monero's privacy capability solely under \"ring signatures\" (which from what I've read, CryptoNote enables?) - so it's just confusing for me when people don't relate to CryptoNote and rather draw attention to only \"ring signatures\", as if Monero were to create it and implement it themselves.\r  \n\r  \nProbably just a simple misunderstanding from my side, but I just want to make sure.\r  \n\r  \nThanks.",

                            "response": "You're on the right line of thinking. I'll try to supplement with what I believe is the technically correct answer.\n\nAny exchange that wants to manipulate prices over the long term, needs to be the exchange with the highest real volume, or needs to collude with multiple exchanges to have the highest real volume combined.\n\nOtherwise, what happens is that as they try to suppress price and force it down with fake sells on their platforms, other exchanges acting honestly, don't have commensurate XMR sells on their platforms. So price drops on the lying exchange, and stays the same on honest exchanges (maybe even goes up).\n\n Then arbitrators come in to even out the price, and the exchange who runs out of liquidity first, is forced to end up pegging to the exchange with higher real volume. Either that, or if they're *really* deadset on suppressing price, they can eat the arbitration loss themselves, but it costs them money to do so.\n\nSo for example, let's say that users on Binance are leaving, withdrawing their XMR. Binance is now low on liquidity to meet withdraws. Meanwhile, lets say that people are buying on Kraken, and price is rising over there, but Binance is rigging their prices, just saying that the price is lower.\n\nNow the arbitrators come in and try to withdraw cheap XMR from Binance, to sell at a higher price on Kraken and pocket the difference. If Binance (and their cohorts at Poloniex, Bitfinex, et al), can't come up with the Monero to meet withdraw demand, then Binance loses, then one of two things happens. \n\nEither they peg their price to Kraken, and start buying Monero at an even higher price, to continue meeting customer demand, or they freeze withdraws. In which case, no one regards their price as accurate or reliable. You might see a price divergence develop, especially on places like Bisq, Havano, Kraken, etc. There might be faku volume, but they progressively erode themselves into XMR irrelevance. No genuine DEX, CEX, or individual will accept a lower quote from Binance, when they can get a better price elsewhere.\n\nSo hopefully that illustrates why the exchange(s) with higher real (honest) volume end up setting the price.\n\nWhich is why we're making this big push. If we can get enough people off these fractional reserve exchanges, we might get some positive price discovery. The trick that Binance and others have used, is the fact that probably only a fraction of people ever withdraw their XMR at any given time. \n\nIt means they can sell a claim on XMR that doesn't exist, without having reduced the supply of real Monero on the open market.\n\n If we can get enough people to call their bluff, and just withdraw what they already bought, probably many months ago, then yes, we're essentially successful on what will probably look like a multi phase approach. \n\nPhase two will be for us to populate the upcoming DEXes with real volume and liquidity, maybe combined with another Monerun push.",

Opportunity cost is real. You have no guarantee whether they will *ever* pay you back. \n\nIn other words, their naked short stays OPEN, and keeps price suppressed. Because until the moment they actually buy real XMR to pay the customer (maybe never), it never gets reflected in price.\n\n\n\nAnd the higher the price, the more painful it is for them to make good on the claim. And furthermore, you're withdrawing at least *some real* liquidity off their platform.\n\nYou have to realize that these guys live and die by liquidity, real funds on their exchange. \n\nBut the easiest most fundamental way you can know that what Im saying is right...  Leaving your funds in a place that is lying to you and doesn't actually custody the assets they promised, is insane.

It seems almost impossible for software to achieve real randomness without any human random input (dice rolls ect).  What exactly is generating random numbers because it has to be based on something?  I know for the electrum wallet, its based on the random function in a python library.  \n\n\nEDIT: Might have found the answer in this article.  \nhttps://medium.com/@brandonarvanaghi/analyzing-trezor-firmware-mnemonic-seed-generation-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-4b03fbaad24d",

So what they do is take the probability that the tagged output is included as a decoy in an average transaction (very low), subtract that from 100, and use that as their answer (99.99%+). That's not the actual probability though, because \"the chance of the tagged output being picked as a decoy\" is a completely incorrect question to begin with. It assumes that the exchange already knows, for certain, that those particular funds were later re-deposited onto the exchange by the dealer, in which case the entire argument is irrelevant.\n\nYou have to consider *all of the other outputs* *selected* as possible sources of the funds. So it technically could've come from that output, but it is equally likely that it came from any of 120 others. And also the fact that there are going to be several other transactions using the output as a decoy, plus several more using the outputs from *those* transactions, means that it quickly becomes impossible to determine where the funds actually went. Or if they moved at all.\n\nThe author is either a complete moron or is knowingly lying in order to slander Monero. Maybe both.",

                    "response": "These are not at all dumb questions\n\n> Is there any advantage to using the GUI wallet on a Ledger instead of just keeping it on my desktop?\n\nFirst and foremost, keep a physical copy of your **Monero** wallet mneomnic seed phrase on paper (or metal, etc). You can *always* recover with that phrase. With the 12(?) word Ledger wallet, you still depend on Ledger and its hardware -- not the Monero blockchain directly.\n\nPersonally I don't use Ledger, it's just more hardware that can go wrong and is an increased attack surface. I keep a \"cold\"/paper wallet for savings, and for transactions I keep a wallet (ie, the wallet files) on a removable drive that I plug in only while actually transacting. IMO just as good physical security (arguably even better, since it's a LUKS encrypted partition) and trivially easy for me to back up.\n\n> Can my everyday MacBook Pro run the GUI or does the blockchain take enormous amounts of memory?\n\nI haven't run the GUI on a MacBook so can't confirm. But the on-disk blockchain is ~130 GB; with sharding, around a third of that. RAM requirements even for the GUI should not be a concern.\n\nYou can also use \"simple mode\" which uses a remote node and therefore does not download the whole blockchain. An adversarial remove node is theoretically possible; you may wish to use a Tor remote node to ensure you can't be denonymized (see https://monero.fail for public nodes)\n\n> the funds become anonymous again once they're out of the CEX?\n\nThe finds become anonymous as soon as they hit your private self-hosted wallet. As others have noted, the address you withdraw to from the CEX will be known to the CEX (else they could not send you the funds), but knowing that address does not give away how much you have, where you got it, or where you subsequently spend it. You might want to give the CEX a subaddress that you only use for that CEX, or if the CEX doesn't support withdraw to a subaddress, do a subsequent transfer to a second wallet whose address the CEX does not know.",

                    "response": "So there are 2 main options for getting Monero. \n\nFirst is to convert directly to Monero with USD. You can use [localmonero](https://localmonero.co/) as a p2p method, or there are a few CEXs that you can buy from (such as KuCoin which you mentioned). Just make sure that you trust the CEX and that it will work for what you're trying to do.\n\nSecond is to convert from another cryptocurrency. Litecoin & BitcoinCash are good options because they both have low fees, are widely accepted, and can be obtained much more easily from a CEX than Monero. From there, you can easily swap those for Monero. Check out [kycnot.me](https://kycnot.me) for a bunch of options.\n\n>Is there any advantage to using the GUI wallet on a Ledger instead of just keeping it on my desktop?\n\nYes, a hardware wallet is more secure. A software wallet can be plenty secure too, though, if you take the proper precautions and know what you're doing. But if it's going to be on your regular desktop, then a hardware wallet is a must-have.\n\n>Can my everyday MacBook Pro run the GUI or does the blockchain take enormous amounts of memory?\n\nWell the entire blockchain is more than 100 gb, but it's kept on the hard drive as opposed to memory, and you don't even need to download it to use Monero. When setting up the GUI, use \"Simple Mode\", which connects to other nodes instead of you having to download the blockchain yourself. A full node (with the blockchain downloaded) is generally preferable, but it's not the end of the world if you don't.\n\nLong story short, yes, any reasonably modern computer can run the GUI wallet.\n\n>If i buy Monero with USD on KuCoin and transfer to the GUI wallet, is the privacy aspect destroyed at the gate or do the funds become anonymous again once they're out of the CEX?\n\nThe exchange will only be aware of the transaction which they sent your Monero through. After that, they won't know anything.",

Maybe an bit of an exaggeration, but not much.\n\nWhat you are hearing about heavy power usage is for ASIC miners for things like BitCoin, Ethereum and others use (mainly) GPUs, and Monero uses the CPU to mine. Since the CPU horsepower of a RaspPi is tiny, so is its power use - and mining potential.",

                    "response": "Greetings,\n\nAs a novice to the CryptoCurrency space and XMR, I had thought to better understand what the future potential of XMR might be.\n\nThe general control of government over our financial well being be it through inflation or restricting funds (per subjective value judgments in the Trucker Protest and ongoing Russian conflict) is unattractive. The intention of Bitcoin, to my understanding, was to wrestle this control from the Government, permitting financial freedom. However, Bitcoin though an improvement over our traditional financial system with regards to governmental control over the money supply can due to its public ledger have its transactions tracked permitting the imposition of financial restrictions. XMR (through some complex systems) resolves the issue of this tracking, so as to be an improvement over Bitcoin. \n\nAlbeit, this is where my confusion begins. Bitcoin and XMR were both intended as digital currencies, and for some thing to be a good currency (beyond acceptability which is increasing for both BTC and XMR alike), there must be a stability in its value. This stability is at present absent, and most all Crypto Currencies are viewed as investments, and I struggle to see why the prices of BTC and XMR must rationally continually increase? Is it due to only ever increasing adoption, for unlike ETH and others they (BTC and XMR) do not have additional utility through DApps and the like such that in the future these would only match inflation (if Fiat is still as powerful) or otherwise be stagnant so as to be hedge against the ills of government (more so in the case of XMR than BTC)? Or is it there something more like maybe the scarcity of XMR as people want to conduct private transactions in ever increasing amounts that would continually cause XMR to appreciate.\n\nEffectively, I'm not sure whether XMR is an investment or not. To my present understanding, it is in its ultimate form is what a checking account might have been today had the Gold Standard been not been abandoned or any shenanigans performed therein. So a great product but one does not expect great returns from one's checking account.\n\nI am grateful for your taking the time to read this post, and any thoughts you might share.\n\nWishing you a pleasant day/night.",

For me it is a logical decision to hold a chunk of xmr.\n\nMany tokens have inflation as well, btc and xmr are capped and the future will increase scarcity. Basic supply and demand.

Github (Microsoft, US) given ultimatum to remove Monero project & removes it\n5. Any atomic swap providers (domains) will keep popping up, and be brought down on government seizures\n6. More Darknet market seizures and clever government bots running Tor exit nodes\n7. All western/Asian/Chinese/Russian countries get together to place an outright ban on privacy coin activity\n8. Anyone found to deal with Monero, or any source of money trailed out from Monero (e.g. Monero -> Bitcoin) will be tracked. When such Bitcoin enters a KYC exchange to be cashed out - will be frozen without reasons.\n9. Any post promoting Monero on social media; their (twitter) accounts banned - or provided up to 3 warnings, before their account is taken down.\n10. The only cash on-ramp would be via CBDCs. And direct purchase of Monero would be tracked and blocked - as much as possible. All different countries' CBDCs will be interoperable via cross-blockchain to better collaborate/track-n-trace citizen activities.\n\nThese are the possible worse case scenario that I could see happening.

For example:\n\n>The United States should ensure that safeguards are in place and promote the responsible development of digital assets to protect consumers, investors, and businesses; maintain privacy; and shield against arbitrary or unlawful surveillance, which can contribute to human rights abuses.\n\nIt's a \"have your cake and eat it too\" mentality. As we know here, you can have privacy for all or privacy for none, and no in between. Cryptography cannot pick and choose which transactions to make traceable based on some moral or legal standard.\n\nAlso, the text refers to \"obscured blockchain ledgers\", which sounds like another way to describe privacy coins:\n\n>Growth in decentralized financial ecosystems, peer-to-peer payment activity, and obscured blockchain ledgers without controls to mitigate illicit finance could also present additional market and national security risks in the future.  The United States must ensure appropriate controls and accountability for current and future digital assets systems to promote high standards for transparency, privacy, and security \u2014 including through regulatory, governance, and technological measures \u2014 that counter illicit activities and preserve or enhance the efficacy of our national security tools.",

Just my life experience.\n\nIf they 'ban' crypto's and service providers that do not adhere to AML/KYC/CTF what does that look like in real life? Do they go after 1 or 2 people? Put it in the newspapers and give themselves a pat on the back? A bit like the Drug War?\n\nThis is point #1 they know they can't stop it. The people using these things, already know what they are doing. And why. You will see a drop of usage with the threat of imprisonment and other things like fines or taking assets but it won't kill the space and they know it.\n\nPoint #2 is that both sides of the party left and right all want to leave routes open for themselves. You don't think the rich and powerful use cash, gold, art, wine and anonymous cryptocurrencies to do the things that they do such as evade tax and launder money? C'mon now.\n\nWhat I think they WILL do.\n\nOnce they introduce these things, in whatever manner that they do it; FED Coin, digital dollar, cbdc, whatever. I think they will purposely make it easy to transfer from crypto into their version of it, they may even offer tax incentives. I'm in Australia and currently, they tax crypto as capital gains, if they said OK, no more capital gains on crypto, but you have 2 years to xfer your crypto into our version of it, tax-free, they will not only grow usage of their new currency but they will suck up so much data it'll be unbelievable.\n\nAnd in that data will be a privacy token wallet or address that is an anonymous one. And that is when they knock on the door and demand to see what you have done with it, sucking up more data, creating more connections.\n\nThey will use this as a kind of honey pot to build their own knowledge on what is going on underground in my opinion. What they do with that is what they have always done. They will pick and choose who they go after. They will negotiate deals and get the odd criminal here and there.\n\nThey will not ban its use because they know that won't work and will instead push use further underground but instead, they will simply look for usage of these things and then come door-knocking for data.\n\nAs a side note, of course, they will use their cbdc or whatever they call it and the rules behind it to build upon their social credit system and of course, if you are caught with these things you will be put onto their naughty list. These things are a given. Its already happening, in Canada, Russia etc.\n\nJust my opinion.",

One of the reasons BTC is great besides its liquidity and convertibility, is the volume and amount of transactions. The more transactions globally occurring off CEX's, the more KYC bitcoin is created. It starts becoming exponentially more difficult to track.

They can't stop non-custodial wallets or shut down the entire banking system to ensure people are not sending their money to a random individual for bitcoin. \n\nNow if people are using custodial BTC wallets that's a different story, but what's happened in Canada has been a fantastic bit of non-custodial promo and edu.",

It seems you're focused on one aspect of this ... prosecuting someone in court. But of course, that's really maybe one of the lower risks. In this context, we're talking about Canada freezing bank accounts extrajudicially.\n\nThey don't need to build a case, that's the whole point of emergency powers.\n\n> It starts becoming exponentially more difficult to track. The more BTC getting distributed from the Sinaloa cartel, the better.\n\nI don't think that's true amigo. The 1MB block limit on Bitcoin is really not that much, in comparison to the resources of computing and storage power these days. Half a terabyte is nothing for any high capability computer, *especially when new data trickles in at a rate of 6MB per hour. Furthermore, the kind of surveillance being conducted is pretty extensive, as we've repeatedly seen revealed. Your ISP is reporting back to the NSA, along with social media.\n\nCombine that with the fact that the vast majority of people don't use any privacy whatsoever. \n\n> The feds, an Israeli firm, and ETC tracked the Bitfinex hacks (pun) for years and still wouldn't have caught them if they hadn't kept 2000 unencrypted seeds in the cloud and communications about it in basic email.\n\nI think it's a very presumptive mistake to fancy that we know anything about the Bitfinex hack, or the couple that was caught. There's alot of unaswered questions with regard to this. Besides which, the Feds will *very often* track someone for a year or more, to try and find their accomplices and sources. The entire thing is shady AF, and could even easily be an inside job. \n\nPoint being, for numerous reasons, it's definitely not usable as point to try and prove that BTC is difficult to track. \n\n> They can't stop non-custodial wallets \n\nNo one said that.\n\nLook I think overall you're trying to imply that we're saying it's IMPOSSIBLE to have ANY privacy in Bitcoin. **We are not saying that**. \n\nIt *is* possible to get some limited privacy in Bitcoin.\nYou have to be tech savvy, and very careful. There are significant risks, particularly risks of the implications of future mistakes on what you believe is current anonymity; and of tainting your coin in ways that make it unusable in places that *most people* want to use it.\n\nPeople in BTC talk about this circular economy, but the scaling absolutely does not support that. A big part of the reason people keep BTC on exchanges is because of the history of fees spiking, and the fact no one actually uses this stuff in a circular economy. No LN does not solve this, so lets not dive into that black hole.\n\nThe point is that Monero is just massively simpler and safer, particularly for a use case like this. We're again seeing the deficiencies of Bitcoin, and it's getting pretty old watching people make excuses for it. I moved on to Monero, because Bitcoin grew stale, and the promises just never materialized. Including/especially the promises for more privacy and fungibility.",

It works best in the winter and the colder it gets in the winter the better it works. It is best to start this process in the late summer.\n\n1) Figure out how much heat BTU / kWh is needed to heat the home. Go for say 50% of the average per day in the fall / winter / spring\n\n2) Buy as many high end CPUs to generate the required amount of heat as one can afford. they will be used for mining Monero. The cost of the electricity will be at least partially offset by the lower heating cost. \n\n1) There should not be a very significant change in the combined heating and electric bill. Again good privacy. If the heat is electric beforehand then no change. \n\n2) Very private, yet it is perfectly legal. For maximum privacy consider paying cash for the CPUs\n\n3) There may be tax consequences. I really do recommend professional tax advice on this. It is complicated since the Monero is a byproduct of say home heating, and could also for example be considered income.",

It's that you shouldn't have to sell anyone on it's privacy features. It's baked in. It's solved.

There are no links to moneroaddress.org in getmonero.org/downloads/\n3. I actually overlooked \"How to create a Monero paper wallet\" guide in getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/, because I looked in \"wallets\" section there, and not in \"general\"\n4. It is unclear whether the author of moneroaddress.org is connected to the developers of Monero or is some random person on the Internet\n5. After losing some money on various interactions with cryptocurrencies I've developed an (un)healthy paranoia about security and trust, and began to treat everything crypto-related from \"untrustworthy until somehow proven otherwise\" standpoint.\n\nSome may say that the source code of monero-wallet-generator is provided, but to check it for backdoors one must have qualifications to write a wallet generator on their own, and I don't have such qualifications.\n\nDisclaimer: English isn't my first language, so there probably are lots of errors in the above text, I'm sorry I did my best.",

Cold wallet (or hardware wallet) savings/hodl that you have the seed phrase physically backed up somewhere a trusted family member can access (or maybe a lawyer).

You might memorize your seed phrase, and put a backup somewhere only you could ever find it. \n\nEach of these have different risks.

I personally recommend Pop OS for doing anything.\n\nTake it a step further by storing the majority of your crypto in cold wallets, regenerate wallet in tails to access funds if needed.\n\nIf you need maximum security for a hot wallet or nodes, you cant beat OpenBSD, I dont think its even close. At that point youre far more likely to make a mistake yourself than having some exploit in the operating system . I wouldnt recommend OpenBSD as a daily driver, its great for a server if available to you.\n\nAbout virtual machines, ignoring qubes you should be using qemu/kvm instead of virtualbox/vmware. Running virtual machines can chug though, and are unnecessary when you could achieve similar privacy and better performance/stability with docker containers. qubes might use containerization like docker, idk.",

The funds are held in multisig addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain side and then you receive a token on the Incognito blockchain that is pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin.\n\nWhen you withdraw the transaction looks somewhat like a massive CoinJoin, meanwhile transactions on the Incognito blockchain use zero-knowledge proofs so they're not traceable either.",

As soon as they fix it on their side I'll enable it immediately.\n\nFor the time being I suggesting using the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) to access [OrangeFren.com](https://OrangeFren.com). I've created the site with Tor in mind and it should only show you the exchanges that support Tor users when opened in the Tor Browser.",

You could for instance buy Bitcoin or Litecoin or Dash then swap it at FixedFloat. You could use Coinbase in this scenario to get one of the aforementioned cryptos.\n\n# #2 Buy Monero directly\n\nThis is easier, but narrows down your options for picking an exchange. You can buy Monero directly with fiat on [Bitfinex](https://bitfinex.com/?refcode=jQfKxCyyP) or the current community favourite - [Kraken](https://Kraken.com).

One has to declare every year if they bought crypto and then provide receipts on what they bought or did with them(from what i understand). I heard about this one person that spent huge amounts of crypto on \"off shore\" gambling sites, almost ended up in life ending debt and almost had his bank account closed.\n\nI spend roughly between 100-300 EUR on crypto/month because all my friends are crypto investors and we use crypto instead of fiat as a currency between each other. I shall ask on a swedish forum about this but, I am in risk of getting any kind of trouble because of all these transactions when its time for my yearly declaration?

Could be cash, check fraud, wire transfer fraud, stolen bank account info or debit cards, credit cards, etc. etc. people get their fiat money stolen from them all the time.\n\nI think a better way of phrasing your question would be to ask if Monero can function like a service like Paypal or a credit card where you can do charge backs or file claims.\n\nThe answer to this is \"no\". Monero currently has no recourse built in. It is electronic cash. Just like regular cash can be stolen and people can be ripped off while paying in cash, the same can happen with electronic cash (Monero).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>How would I buy a service in monero and have a guarantee that the reciepient wont run off with the money?\n\nMy answer to this then would be two things.  \n1) Make sure to only make purchases from people/business who have good reputations. Just like you go and look at Yelp reviews, you need to make sure the people you are dealing with aren't scam artists.  \n2) You can use a service that offers escrow. IE Localmonero offers escrow service so if you bought gold from someone and it never showed up, you could get your Monero back since Localmonero holds onto your XMR while the transaction is pending.",

It's not perfect, but it is really very good and more than sufficient for most all uses. However, if your life is on the line, or could be in the future, your opsec should reflect that and you should not solely rely on Monero to protect you.\n\nSimple things like VPN and tor use, not re-using addresses, and being careful with KYC go a long way.",

Having money on hand for use if very convenient, but you wouldn't want to walk around with $10K on your person.\n\nLedger detracts from convenience for the sake of securing the spending keys away from the internet. You should just use both. Keep in your Cake wallet the amount you expect to spend in a week, and the rest on the Ledger wallet. Better yet, use Monerujo on your phone, once it comes to iOS, since it connects to Ledger directly (no need for computer).",

Where can I learn about their intended uses, how their development is structured, and how decentralized they are?\n\nI'm also open to hear individual opinions on them, provided it's more than just \"\\_\\_\\_ is dumb because it's not Monero\" or \"I invested big in \\_\\_\\_ and you should too so we can go to the moon!\"",

The main reason your node take a while to sync is that it is not only downloading the newest blockchain data, but it is also VERIFYING all of the data. That second part is what takes a long time.\n\nIf it really becomes a nuisance, you might consider running a node on a computer/device that is on 24/7 and connecting to it remotely.\n\nAnother option is to use MyMonero which is a little less private, but does offer faster sync times since the wallet shares \"your private view key with a remote server, continuously scans the blockchain looking for your transactions.\" https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/#mobilelight\n\nThere are some blockchain improvements coming down the pipeline which should improve sync times in the future though. https://bounties.monero.social/posts/28/implement-view-tags-to-decrease-wallet-sync-times-in-monero\n\nCheers!",

Don't know if people got confused or if they are bots.\n\nI won't be able to help much on Sideshift vs Changenow, but I will say that most any exchange service will have access to your IP address. If they have access to your IP, they may or may not log it. You can't necessarily trust what they say either, because there is no real way to verify what they are doing.\n\nAll of that is to say, if you care about your IP address potentially being logged, assume it is being logged and adjust your OPSEC accordingly (use a VPN, don't connect from your home wifi network, etc.).\n\nEdit: This post may be helpful to you.

The Monero added no privacy benefit.\n\nDo you see what I'm saying?",

Think about fungibility in terms of pure water in buckets. Think about three buckets that already have lots of water in them Move a small amount of water from Bucket A to Bucket B. Then move some water from Bucket B to Bucket C. Did the same water from Bucket A get to Bucket C? In some sense yes and in another sense no. The point is, you cannot distinguish among different units of that commodity. Same with Monero.",

Monero has a address structure where you can receive funds with your address and send funds to other addresses and of course Monero also has a Blockchain that logs everything that happens on the network. \n\nThe big difference is that in Monero, this Blockchain is encrypted and therefore not readable for everybody. Each user can only encrypt the part of the Blockchain that contains their transactions. Nothing else. Besides that, Monero uses stealth addresses and ring signatures. stealth addresses make it impossible to link an address to a certain wallet. You could generate an endless ammount of adresses for the same wallet. Ring signatures are like a built in mixer, that make it impossible to track a transaction.\n\nSo to answer your questions:\n\nNone of your transactions will be visible to a third party. They cant encrypt that part of the Blockchain. Only you and the entity you made a transaction with will know about it. \n\nThe sender or receiver you transacted with, of course will know the address, the Monero is coming from or going to. Then the receiver knows that you are somehow using or being connected to this address. But thats all they can tell. If you change your addresses regularly (which is recommended), there is no chance of tracking you.\n\nIf you move funds from one exchange wallet to another, these exchanges probably know the address of each others wallet and therefore can tell where it is coming from. If you put a wallet of yours in between, its like the case above, they both only know an address that is probably somehow connected to you.",

I love the community and I really think a cryptocurrency such as Monero has a huge role to play in a landscape where CBDC's become a dominant force. There are however a couple of things I've had a bit of trouble getting information on and wanted to see if you had any input or background (if any exists):\n\n\u2022\tI've read that the Monero blockchain is about 100 GB right now. Is there any theoretical proposals or consideration given to finding a way to decrease this size? I've seen some talk about using zero knowledge proofs or a separate blockchain (e.g. Arweave) to store blockchain data on other networks, but I'm not familiar if this was discussed for Monero.\n\n\u2022\tWhat is the current speed of the network? I've read a transaction can take around half an hour to be fully validated but the sources are mostly over six months old. If it is still this long is there any proposals that might increase the speed to make Monero even more like digital cash?\n\n\u2022\tAlso is there any way to earn yield on Monero?\n\nI see an item on the future roadmap on GetMonero titled \u201cSecond-layer solutions for speed and scalability\u201d but there isn\u2019t any detail, so are these something that would be discussed in the next couple years? Is GetMonero in discussion with the developers or are they even generally reliable (given this is a decentralized project)? Unlike other networks where I try to look more at the utility, Monero is a bit special in that I feel like I need to look at it more like a competitor to a CBDC. Apologies if I've missed anything obvious.\n\nThanks!",

The community is always looking for new methods to make transactions smaller while increasing privacy protection. Right now the most interesting one to watch is called Seraphis. The other development was blockchain pruning. Pruning the Monero chain is difficult because nobody knows which outputs have been spent, so none may be deleted. The solution was that a pruned chain has an algorithm which deletes all but an eighth of transaction data. This means that one may need to consult multiple pruned nodes to get data you need, but each node can use less disk space and perform well enough for most users.\n\nTo network speed, 0-confirmation transactions are safe enough for small transaction, and blocks are usually found every 2 minutes. Received Monero is locked for 10 blocks as a safety mechanism, so yes, it takes about 20 minutes for received Monero to be spendable, but a transaction may be considered safely validated much quicker than that unless you have very good reason to be paranoid.",

Monero because it is obviously a privacy coin that has stood the test of time and remains the darknet's most popular option. Nano because, despite its immaturity and exposure to spam attacks, it does deliver on the promise of practically instant transactions with zero fees and most importantly is very eco-friendly. This always made me wonder, if these two had a love child, it would be the perfect cryptocurrency. Now, this of course may be a naive layman's delusion. Having said that, what does the Monero community think about this notion? \n\nAre there others who think this is possible? Or is this an impossible dream that cannot occur without compromises. Can a technology like XNO be as private as XMR, and can XMR be as instant and eco-friendly as XNO?",

Kraken is probably easiest, but not as private. LocalMonero is more private, but there can be scammers on there, so if you go that route be careful (check the seller's reputation, and maybe avoid paying with PayPal, Venmo, or CashApp).\n\nOnce the sale is finalized, transfer the XMR out into a wallet where you've secured the private keys. Cake Wallet is probably the easiest if you're on mobile, but I'd only recommend that if you practice good mobile security. For some folks, it might be wiser to use one of the desktop wallets (the Official GUI Wallet or Feather).\n\nAfter that, just keep your keys safe, add to your stash as you can, and stay active in the community.",

Are there more than 11 ring sigs used?\n\nObviously, due to stealth addresses, each output that is created goes to a completely different and unique address, regardless of whether the same receive address was used.\n\nOn the blockchain, does this look like \"Hey, here are X inputs for this transaction, one of theses 11 sigs is responsible for **all** of them\"?\n\nOr are there 11 ring signature for each of the inputs of the transaction and then we end up with more than 11 if there are multiple inputs?

As the one in charge of the cashier, you need to get sure the payment will be proceeded, so you will need to check the confirmation. But you receive from many people paying with all sorts of means of payment all the time. It will be very anoying to check if all monero transactions that was already made long ago are confirmed. It is too much easier to imediatly check the payment in front of the client before pass to the next client. A long time confirmation, specialy for small things, is indeed barier to the adoption in the day to day commerce. People will just prefer to recieve via fast payment methods. You can think, it is just a coffee, if the seller didnt recieve one coffe it will not damage his business, but remember, most of his revenue comes from those small things, and those small things makes the difference for the small sellers. But i agree that having a non private transaction in the middle could harm moneros privacy protection.",

I am not of the mindset personally that Monero should be the end all be all of crypto currency, because everything has a use place for it. Again all bets of are off if you are a criminal on the run, I can understand that paying for a cup of coffee and waiting for the confirmation may be counter productive to your overall life goals.   \n\n\nHowever if I am just a normal person in any number of countries, I am probably going to prioritize where I use Monero to specific purchases where anonymity and discreet purchasing is preferred or maybe even required. Also the problem with wallet transparency is the ability to target specific wallets and go on a whale hunting adventure which may and has worked in the past. Not bad thoughts though, nice to see!",

You can get the effect of this in your own life by using a DEX or atomic swaps to move purchasing power between your savings account (i.e. Monero, where you trade scalability and UX for better privacy) and your casual spending account (i.e. Nano or similar, where you trade privacy for better scaling and UX).\n\nI like Nano, but another interesting option would be Grin (though it is far less mainstream at the moment). The big flaw with Grin is that it does not hide the transaction graph, only the amounts and addresses. But it scales very well due to MimbleWimble cut-through. So it might be a great platform for a casual spending account that has at least some privacy.\n\nNo need to really build anything new. People just need to start exchanging between these coins to personally get the benefits.",

Nevertheless, the adoption of the \u201ctravel rule\u201d through the proposed Regulation raises substantial privacy concerns for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) and their end-users. CASPs would, on top of the strict AML/KYC rules they already apply, now be required to collect users\u2019 (unverifiable) self-declarations disclosing the full identity of persons behind each private crypto-asset wallet address their accounts interact with. The more balanced solution, in our view, would instead be to focus on so-called \u201cblockchain analytical tools\u201d which can increasingly and effectively track and trace suspicious wallets and transaction flows, without compromising legitimate privacy. In parallel, CASPs would keep carrying out strong AML/KYC checks, which would ensure the safety and integrity of transactions conducted on CASPs across Europe.\n\n>Please find our detailed comments in the attached PDF document.\n\nIn essence their argument is that Travel Rule (TR) be replaced with Blockchain Surveillance (BS). It is precisely this argument that has, in my view, led to the Monero de listings over the past few years. South Korea, Japan, Australia and most recently the UK come to mind. \n\n I did some digging and found https://www.blockchain4europe.eu/ and under about us https://www.blockchain4europe.eu/members-and-partners/ is a list of members Binance https://www.binance.com/en is listed as a member. They also refer to Chainanalysis as an example of a service provider.\n\nEdit: It is important to know one's adversary well in order to be able to identify the adversary's point of greatest weakness. Governments and regulators are not the enemy here. They are the battlefield.",

DEXs allow anyone to trade coins/tokens without a central middleman, like a CEX (centralized exchange, e.g. Binance). So this is great for privacy and keeping assets safe, and as a relatively effective way of using Monero in fiat on/off ramps.\n\nTPTB stands for The Powers That Be. Basically another term for big governments, or \"the man\". Some people think \"the man\" works *for* them, but more often than not TPTB have ulterior motives, such as making themselves and their cronies rich. They don't really care much for the average citizen.\n\nSome of this is my own opinion, but I hope it helps answer your questions!",

I personally don't hold any of the silly alts, because I don't really want to get rich quick, just use an asset/cryptocurrency that has utility.\n\nThe only time I engage with DOGE or SHIB is late night short term margin shorts. Normally after a few beers haha. I shorted DOGE and made some decent gains in literally an hour!\n\nI don't do much trading anymore, but I do own a few cheeky tokens that I think might hold their value, e.g. MANA, LRC, ENJ and of course BTC, ETH and XMR. My strategy has made me some gains in the last few years, but this is not financial advice ;)\n\nPeace out!",

Why do you want it on a flash drive?\n\nIn general, the official wallets are the gold standard for privacy and security. You can put the program and the data folder for the program on a flash drive, but it needs access to a node to function. So you plug your flash drive into your computer which is connected to the internet and connect to a remote node so that you can use your wallet. At this point you could have just had your wallet on the computer. If you do not trust the computer, your wallet is no safer on your flash drive than the computer's hard drive so long as the flash drive is plugged in to your computer.",

My family was from the upper class Milieu in Aleppo, and as such, had some money. \n\nAll people funneled their money into land, as a home invasion stealing all your belongings could no longer be ruled out, hyperinflation was ensuing, and those who held USD at the bank couldn't access their money in USD, instead they'd get Syrian Lira at much lower exchange rates (meaning to buy a USD for example you needed 200 Lira, but the bank would pay out your USD balance at an exchange rate of 1:100). \n\nIn other words, no safe storage of money, so people bought land. What ensued next was that the war lasted 10 years instead of an expected 3-8 months, and even the formerly rich families now had no liquid assets, plunging them into poverty. \n\nWe got away by luck, my mom had stashed something like $18k USD that got us out of the country and on our feet, then by luck a former colleague of my father arranged for us to get into their country all expenses paid for 2 years. Others weren't as lucky, including deca millionaires (in USD) plunged into poverty. \n\nNow just imagine if Monero existed back then and they funneled even just $500k of $10m+ in assets into it, they'd be eh ok instead of broke. \n\nSorry for the rant, it's just that as someone who just discovered Monero and comes from a country like Syria, all kinds of uses for it come to mind for me, and a country like Syria doesn't have the resources to audit it at all, even BTC for that matter (although more sophisticated governments can).",

And I think there's nothing I can do. PayPal currently investigates the transfer and checks whether it was legit. If it was, i.e. if the buyer sent the money himself, I can keep my money. But the guy now has several negative reviews on localmonero (ofc he didn't have those when I chose to trade with him) and has been banned for payment reversals. I doubt anyone would be stupid enough to pull such a from his own account, at least not using his own device and own IP address. If the account has been hacked, I would receive the money back from PayPal anyway through their buyer's/seller's protection if I only sold something else. But cryptocurrencies are excluded from this seller's protection. So it looks like I just gifted a scammer money. :( Is there anything I can do?",

All have pros and cons, but there are much better options than PayPal.\n\nhttps://bisq.wiki/Payment\\_methods#Fiat\\_payment\\_methods",

Yes you heard me right properties not property only. Interlectual property, estates anything you could or can worldly posses, they are trying to draft a amendment to be able to repossess in the \"interest of the public\"\n\nI can empathise with this u/archeactive I mean the guy is unfunded and working on a project for all of us just like noot but he has some backing ofcourse I'm not excusing any hate or bad words said towards whoever just that I know sometimes knives sharpen knives I come from a military background and sometimes headbutt about things but just like metal work we get quenched and put back into the fire for more beating and just like everyone .. you are all special and equally worthless okay.\n\nThis whole debacle could be sorted like grown adults with a few minutes and some reasonable deduction.\n\n(Again I know little) so bear with me:\n\n 1. Are the reviewers for the bounty be able to submit code ? ( This creates an immediate conflict of interest)\n\n 2. Whos repo or GitHub or whatever for the project was created first? (The second would have incentive to copy code and speed up their own creation)\n\n 3. Bounties are verified by hashes apparently so who created a working project main.net or not?\n\n 4. Was any code or practices copied without prior approval or consultation with the aforementioned person?\n\n 5. Can bounties be split?\n\nI think we need to humanize this one people, that money could have made all the difference to u/archeactive who was CLEARLY working on the project against many others\n\nAlso don't think noot shouldnt be rewarded for his/her hard work\n\nIn conclusion, you need to take a breather and just look through this through each person's lens and try find a middle ground ... Bickering, bans and censoring has got all the tell tale signs of the ideology and overreach we are trying to avoid\n\nThank you for coming to my ted talk.",

It's his only card to play, and unfortunately for the rest of us, he's becoming quite good and loud at playing said victim complex card.  \n\nAnyone examining the matter in detail would quickly see that archeactive's so-called bounty-fulfilling proposal does not fill the requirements for the bounty at all, and his code is non-existant or flawed.  \n\nThe \"middle ground\" between a deliberate detractor (archeactive) and any sincere contribution is objectively worse than the sincere contribution on its own.

With lightning, you might not be able to trace which IP address a transaction is linked to, which is what your description seems to suggest. The issue is that your address is still on the blockchain once you settle.\n\nLightning is basically a group of users passing around Bitcoin debt. There is a little bit more than what I am about to describe in order to prevent fraud, but I believe it is true in principle. Instead of sending your transaction to the blockchain, you and another person both sign a transaction which sends some amount of bitcoin to yourselves, but you do not broadcast it to the network. If you want to send money to the other person, you resign the transaction so that more of the money goes to the other person, but you still do not broadcast it. Then the other person signs the transaction so that it would be valid and written to the blockchain if either of you broadcasted it. In this way, you can transact without ever touching the ledger, but you have to trust the other person to play along. If they do not play along, you do not lose your money. You just send the transaction you have been holding to the network and then the contract pays out and you both get your money back plus or minus any transactions you have agreed upon, but you have to pay transaction fees at that point and also everyone knows that money moved from one address to another because the transaction is on the blockchain now.\n\nIt starts to sort of look like privacy if you are doing this with a lot of people. If Alice wants to pay Bob and Alice and Bob both have open lightning contracts with Charlotte, Alice can change her contract with Charlotte so that some of the money Charlotte owes Alice is now owed to Bob without Charlotte knowing. But once the thing collapse and gets settled back on the chain, everyone still sees Alice's wallet lose some amount of money and Bob's wallet gain that amount of money.\n\nAlso, even if Charlotte is a clueless messenger, Alice has to know Bob's real bitcoin address to set up the transaction. If Alice knows that, then Alice can look up every previous transaction to and from Bob's real bitcoin address. That is a lot of information, even if it does not include IP addresses. Bob might have set up a one-time address, but Alice can see what wallet funded that address, which might be Bob's real address. Maybe Bob can be clever to obscure where the rest of his money is, but he has to be clever, and that cleverness requires him to have done everything perfectly from the beginning of time on a chain which was not designed to be private at all.\n\nMonero has none of these problems. If you have a Monero address, you cannot see how much money it holds or where any of its balance came from. If somone pays you with Monero, you do not know what address the money came from. When a Monero transaction settles, nobody knows how much money was involved except for the person sending the money and the person receiving the money. This is built into the spec. There is no way to waste a trading partner's money or force previously private information onto the public blockchain by forcing settlement. You do not need to have a previously existing liquidity relationship by proxy or otherwise with another person to transact privately with them. A payer only needs to have Monero and know a payee's address to pay them, and if they do, they know almost nothing about the payee except that the address belongs to them.",

Because we Monero community are not sold to the dollar we don\u2019t care about dollars this means our mind is stronger than they ever taught of us.

It is usual to allow naked shorts in exchanges ... and with private coins it is absolutely easy.\n\nIf that's true, I just don't understand why they don't do something about it. They have the lowest XMR lending rate on the market (0.02% day ~ 7% year). Why don't they raise it above market level (from 0.08% to 0.12% day ~ from 29% to 44% year) and force these naked shorts to close? Why don't they buy some real XMR crumbs elsewhere? Or raise the price level so that the coins can come from elsewhere. After all, it is possible to operate an XMR exchange with about 10% real coins. People do not withdraw often, most purchases lie in exchanges.",

Perhaps, you could swap in seconds and give dealers btc  wich you just swapped with xmr. \n\nTho still not good because btc could be tainted, or bch since btc fees are annoying. \n\nA dream would be tho tlmost accept xmr :)\n\nAnother thing IMo worth mentioning, is (tho I'm not sure where exactly but very likely) possible to buy prepaid debit cards with monero. \n\nWhen there is a trustworthy (maybe not even trust needed) virtual credit card service (now, assuming its a good one, encrypted no need do trust the service etc.) You could buy these prepaid debit cards send it to your virtual credit card and live like that. Or atleast, you know use e.g. euro but cleaned. \n\nAnyways, what I'm saying is in future when xmr is not accepted directly there will always be good ways to walk around that.",

I never pay for porn so I never subscribed and had to make do with the promotional content.\n\nBut this particular video shook me to the very core. So much so that I was tempted to spend no less than $25 just for that video. So much so that I even contacted the page to ask them if they accept Monero (because I didn't want an OnlyFans debit in my bank statement). They refused but I still wasn't giving up.\n\nI created an account, filled in my card details and was about to throw away my money at temporary gratification when I did some introspection. I imagined that I had already paid for it, committed the carnal sin and sat in that very seat, covered in filth. Short of $25. \n\nThat thought stopped me in my tracks. I could use those $25 in so many better ways. A bus ride to a new city, a cab ride to a social-event with the opportunity to slay some real life pussy or just save it. All better deals than just some salacious stimulation.\n\nSo, I closed the tab. Opened up Binance. And increased my then stock of Monero.\n\nNow, three months later, those $25 are approximately $35 (I'm not sure if the exact amount because I already had a Monero bag) and the content I was so close to paying for is now available for free (it's being downloaded as I type). \n\nThree months ago, I had two options. One would've lost me $25 and the other gained me $10. But the second option required patience and perseverance. Which, I'm pleased to announce, I possessed.\n\nTl;dr: Patience is a virtue.",

It is a bit outdated now (the primary author SirHack is working on a 2nd edition), but most of it still holds true. You can get a copy here: [https://masteringmonero.com/](https://masteringmonero.com/)\n\nIf you are selling in a market, you can print out a little sign saying \"Monero/XMR accepted here\". You can find some here: [https://www.themonera.art/2017/09/22/monero-promotional-graphics-badges-and-stickers-for-websites/](https://www.themonera.art/2017/09/22/monero-promotional-graphics-badges-and-stickers-for-websites/)\n\nI'd suggest offering a discount if people pay in XMR. That will potentially get non-XMR users interested and will DEFINITELY attract current XMR users.\n\nYou can easily just have your wallet running on your phone and create a new subaddress for each buyer. After payment, you would just wait 2-3 minutes and once you have 1 confirmation, they are good to go.\n\nIf you are dealing with larger sums of money, you can also create a \"view only\" wallet. Basically, this is a way of being able to receive and track payments, while not actually holding the XMR on the device you keep at the market (would be kept on your home computer for example). See here for more info (specifically \"GUI: Creating a View-Only Wallet from an Existing Wallet File\")- [https://www.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/view\\_only.html](https://www.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/view_only.html)\n\nOnce you have your view-only wallet info, you can import it into Monerujo (android) or CakeWallet (ios) and you are good to go.\n\nBest of luck! :)",

By the time they become \"transparent\" for a malicious outsider, they shouldn't be capable of revealing anything unless the outsider has also stored every piece of metadata that has ever happened surrounding the interval of the transaction.

CakeWallet would be your best bet.\n\n**Note:** Just a word of warning since you mentioned the need to be \"anonymous\" and needing a wallet that is \"untraceable\". **If your threat model is such that you truly do need to be anonymous, well, with IOS you are setting yourself up to have a bad time.**\n\nI'm not saying that your XMR transactions will necessarily be compromised, they still should be private, but IOS is put together in such a way that being truly anonymous (even with a reputable Monero wallet) is very hard to do.\n\nYour average bloated android phone is not much better, but there are at least ways to make the phone more private (get rid of google play, put a new OS, change the keyboard, change the wifi/gps settings, etc.). With IOS you are just screwed.\n\nYou should assume that apple know exactly what apps you are using, when you are using them, what you are typing in your keyboard, your exact location and much more. Just thought I'd throw that out there.\n\n*Edit: Don't mean to spread FUD, just a reality check. For everyday uses and a normal threat level, ios and cake are just fine.*",

I have now looked twice at their website, curiously and with an open mind, and still have no clue what exactly should be the point of it all, and where exactly the interesting innovation lies. As long as I don't understand the \"this\", I cannot judge at all whether \"something like this\" could be done for Monero as well.\n\nI vaguely get that their consensus protocol has making Bitcoin transactions as part in there somewhere. Well, we all know what PITA making such transactions can be at times, with congestion and sky-high fees. If I am not gravely mistaken that could mean that if the Bitcoin blockchain goes through some hard phase Stacks won't work reliably any more either.\n\nFurthermore, if Stacks ever becomes really successful, and Bitcoin miners somehow think that the transactions of their miners disturb in any way, or if Stacks gets to be seen as unwelcome competition to Bitcoin itself, I would guess there would be ways to discriminate against those transactions, given that everything is so transparent with Bitcoin. This latent danger alone could already sink the project IMHO.",

The Zcash Foundation did not require any information of ZOMG committee members until recently, when they decided to require this information.

                    "response": "I like some things said in the writeup. However as someone who has studied tax law for a few years as an IRS licensed enrolled agent, I would not recommend being so arbitrary in the approach to classify such dealings as a hobby. I would especially be wary of classifying an actual business as a hobby for the purposes of avoiding filing reports to FinCEN. Doing so could result in rather serious civil or criminal penalties.\n\nGiven we're talking about crypto here (public blockchains in particular), such transactions could be easily identified on the blockchain - especially now that the IRS will receive $80 billion dollars in these new bills to help expand their capacities to do just that. I'd comply to the best of my capacity just to avoid even being contacted by the IRS and having to deal with them.\n\nFirstly, the IRS will assume that an entity or person that consistently makes a profit engaging in an activity will be doing it as a business. I would also note that anyone that does actively care about profiting from a business wouldn't want to classify as a hobby - especially if it's just for avoiding this rather simple (but surely tedious) reporting requirement. Classifying a business as a hobby prevents that entity from claiming deductions that business can typically take. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law a few years ago got rid of deductions for misc hobby expenses.\n\nThis example here: \"So, a kid making NFTs for fun and selling them for $10,000 to $20,000 a piece won't need to report the large transactions, because he is spending 6+ hours a day at school, he's making the NFTs for fun, and he isn't working on any kind of work schedule. The amount of money made is incidental to an informal activity done primarily for fun, and thus it counts as hobby income.\" - Good luck explaining this to the IRS. I would just file those reports. I suspect the IRS would absolutely classify this as business activity given the profitable activity and the reasonable expectation of such an activity being profitable.\n\nI also want to note that crypto beforehand was not considered cash. I myself am waiting for guidance to see if this changes because as of now virtual currency is actually considered property. This is why you have to report gains or losses when crypto moves ownership. This is not done with cash. Under these new regulations, however, for the purposes of filing form 8300, it will be considered cash. If you look at this form, crypto is not listed as a form of cash. These are the options:\n\na U.S. currency\n\nb Foreign currency\n\nc Cashier\u2019s check(s)\n\nd Money order(s)\n\ne Bank draft(s)\n\nf Traveler\u2019s check(s)\n\nAccording to the IRS: \"Virtual currency is a digital representation of value, other than a representation of the U.S. dollar or a foreign currency..\"\n\nIt's actually not clear, in my opinion, that payments in crypto of over $10,000 had to be previously reported on this form. Now they do.\n\nFurthermore, the expectation from this is that there will be a lot more KYC introduced into the DeFi and crypto space. I'm not myself too familiar with the functions of DeFi but I could see many DeFi projects like Uniswap, for example, requiring information from users before setting up so that when certain dollar thresholds are hit, a report is filed. Some others are concerned about miners, stakers, and lenders being implicated in this as well - though I'd be curious how that would logistically work. Either way, given the potential penalties many could be spooked away from the space especially if the implications of the law on the sector remain ambiguous.\n\nI, myself, am not worried. Private crypto is the only crypto that I really like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote, none of this is meant to be tax or legal advice. Just my personal view based on what I know.",

At this point, *Bitcoin* is on the back foot, and must explain why I need it; because I can hardly think of a reason  \n\n- If I want sound permissionless digital money (*which includes confidentiality*), I'll use Monero.\n\n- If I want price performance during a bull market, I'll throw 5 darts at the top 100 and do better than BTC. Or better, I'll chose a token designed with game theory for price pumps. \n\n- If I want to play with defi gambling stuff, I'll use Eth.\n\n- If I need liquidity, I'll go to Kraken for their XMR-fiat pairs.\n\n- If it's a bear market, I'll hold fiat, metal, or stablecoins (again some of them on Eth).\n\n- If a dumb retailer only accepts BTC, then I'll go find a retailer that accepts XMR. As a last resort, I'll swap into BTC, but it's so rare I need to do this.\n\nMonero is doing fine. In fact, we're holding parity with Corn, despite the fact that we're ignored, hated, delisted, network attacked, socially attacked, and price attacked. The state of our popularity and price already has all of that reflected. So just imagine what happens when those manufactured external negativities subside. \n\nMaybe one day years from now BTC will prove LN functional/safe at scale; and with atomic swaps Bitcoin can become a 2nd layer for Monero. Until then, I'm not interested in participating in a stagnant network that can barely upgrade once ever 4 years.",

Bitcoin is not a privacy coin.\u201d*\n\n*Bitcoin can be better thought of as pseudonymous rather than fully anonymous, as many transactions on the BTC blockchain can still be traced even with these privacy improvements.*\n\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-will-never-be-truly-private-says-andreas-antonopoulos",

                    "response": ">Every conversation seems to break down to some kind of guilt by association or support of bad people and bad uses and this seems to perpetually keep Monero in the dark.\n\nA common trace among many proponents of fungibility as Monero's essential feature is their feeling of guilt about privacy. They are ashamed of privacy. They consider that being private is indeed a crime. They have introjected the bankster god's all-seeing eye and believe that privacy is not their right.\n\nHowever, Monero's fungibility is only the result of its untraceability, and its untraceability is only the result of its privacy. Therefore, privacy, not fungibility, is Monero's supremely distinctive quality. One cannot even understand Monero's fungibility without beforehand understanding its untraceability, and thus its privacy.\n\nUS dollar notes are traceable, and therefore transactions using them are not perfectly private; still, such US dollar notes are fungible because of a legal command. Meanwhile, Monero's fungibility is not the result of any legal command as with US dollar notes, but of its untraceability, and therefore of its privacy.\n\nBottom line, this anxiety to hide Monero's privacy features in favor of exclusively promoting its fungibility as it were not a mere result of its privacy has nothing to do with making Monero better understood and accepted by others, but merely with the need to show subservience to the bankster god's all-seeing eye.",

Monero has network effect.  It is the GOLD standard for fungible cryptoassets.\n\nI know most of us are sick of the whole \"darknet\" association as we see the fundamental value of Monero to go much further than crime.  But illegal use is THE acid test that Bitcoin has failed in the realm that Monero owns.  Monero IS the currency of the darknet.  And Monero cannot be stopped, even if governments want to.  They cannot nail it to a cross without cementing it's reputation.  They will tend to ignore it publicly and try to subvert it in the shadows, and they will lose.\n\nBut just like most alts are to Bitcoin, the other privacy coins will perform research for the king to swallow up over time as it pleases.\n\nYou come at the king... you best not miss.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvmO99MEdg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvmO99MEdg)",
