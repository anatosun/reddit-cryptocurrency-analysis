One such case still alive, and with their focus on mobile payments even with something like a use case, is Electroneum.\n\nThey ripped out most of Monero's privacy technology to have smaller transactions and smaller blockchain, and replaced PoW by some permissioned mining by few priviledged nodes. I think they also had an ICO instead of a \"fair launch\", and on top of everything it's a company. A true a shitcoin then :)",

It's a shared ledger, maintained by thousands of nodes globally.\n\nThe key difference is that Bitcoin broadcasts all transactions in plaintext, but Monero encrypts the transactions before broadcasting, so that only the sender and recipient can decrypt the important data.\n\nOther important things:    \n- CPU mining makes hashpower much more geographically distributed.    \n- Dynamic blocks mean that blocks can increase in size, but only if there's actual transaction saturation at the current level.   \n- Fees per transaction go down when block size goes up.     \n- Totally separate codebase for Bitcoin, not just a code fork.    \n- Critical portions of the code have received multiple independent 3rd party audits, particularly before major upgrades.",

I've heard that but no one has explained it to me yet.\n\nMy response was:\n\n> Many cryptocurrencies have a transparent ledger.  You or I can look up the balances or transactions for any address in the world and see everything.    For a business accepting BTC you could trivially find out their current amount of BTC is in that wallet and how much they sent as payment to distributors if they use the account or how much they charged other customers etc.\n\n>Monero solves this problem by taking the cryptography a step further and verifying consensus without revealing any transactional and balance information about anyone using it.  It is much closer to the current idea of fiat cash whereas transparent blockchain are more like your bank where everyone in the whole world is the bank\u2026. your spouse, your mom and dad, and your worst enemy.\n\n>Monero is constantly updated to maintain this footing of privacy versus people seeking to steal that personal information and so far is winning by leaps and bounds.  It\u2019s what BTC was meant to be in terms of the white paper imo.",

This version of the distribution will have much more flexibility than version 1.0.0.\n\nMy plan is to make the system as scriptable as possible and give more power to the user through a CLI interface easily accessible through SSH. This distribution also strives for efficiency using a minimal and fast init system called dinit to start the system in seconds from a cold boot. \n\nRight now the user is able to control the system easily within a tmux session over SSH. A few plans I have for this is having keybinds for the user to easily start and stop the mining software, monitor the mining software with ease, and possibly make a pinephone friendlier interface for if the user connects to the system on a pinephone.\n\nI've been hesitant to ask for funding, but have finally convinced myself to take a shot at it. I've been needing the money to build a completely dedicated Ryzen system for testing the CPU mining tools. I'm not asking for much most likely up to 1000 USD in XMR at most to build a decent system for development.\n\nI have already put videos up on LBRY/Odysee of the development. I've mostly worked on my Hive Pirate tools for GPU mining alongside CPU mining on the system. I have recently just started rewriting my CPU mining tools to be more efficient and easier to use.\nVersion 2.0.0 will be a massive upgrade to version 1.0.0. Once I get a release put together I will upload all of the tools and the distribution to Gitlab.\n\n[My Odysee channel](https://odysee.com/@wheezybackports:e)\n\nFunding address:\n82xNT9EtgeT1syXYP9L1Tf8uEsyBDXUg55V8fqL2bKs1bMrGRLGv4aqfiy8vypcSGsLS6TJ8ogWx51HciLrd6cd9Ga5g7TR",

Receiving addresses never appear on the blockchain thanks to stealth addresses, and amounts are hidden by RingCT. So even if monero's ring size was 1, an attacker *still* wouldn't be able to see who you do business with or how much monero you have.   \n\n\nAnytime you see a comparison to monero based purely on anonymity set, you should take it with a huge grain of salt.

People prefer to be free to select what they like. so when that freedom is taken away, they are motivated to restore it. Psychological reactance can be better explained as the idea that an item will be wanted more if people are told they cannot have it, which can relate to reverse psychology on some levels. Another influence technique that relates to reverse psychology is strategic self-anticonformity. Strategic self-anticonformity is when a person advocates a position that is opposite of their true thought, while hiding the fact that they are using a persuasion tactic. A common example of such is marketing techniques or tricks such as \"do not click this link,\" or \"do not push this button.\" Strategic self-anticonformity and psychological reactance relate in their expected negativity or disagreeableness from their influence target.\n\n- Wikipedia \n\nI know Wikipedia cannot be trusted for most information, so below is a more educational article.\n\n50 year review of psychological reactance theory: Do not read this article\n\nhttps://scholar.dominican.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=psychology-faculty-scholarship\n\nI recommend looking into this to get a better idea of how the \"Don't buy Monero\" advertisement is supposed to work. Or don't look into it the choice is yours.",

This impact is what makes someone more likely to look up the project and do their own research.\n\n**Appeal to og crypto ideologists**\n\nThere is a reason bitcoin was revolutionary when it came out. It was peer to peer digital money. The power it held was in an alternative from of money that could be used online without a third party needed. It's power never came from the establishment and banks backing it as their investment, it's true potential power was in creating an alternative system that would be more fair than the monopoly that central banks currently held and abused at the expense of most people. \n\nThis idea is what brought about most of the early users of bitcoin. It is still the same value proposition that bitcoin holds but it has been watered down as nothing more than marketing material for selling financial products around bitcoin. The thing is, there are still people looking for what bitcoin promised as the future in the early days. This ad targets those users and forces them to look into doing their own research. Which is all that Monero ads should strive for. \n\n**I would make one change**\nI would change \"cryptocurrencies\" and change it to \"anonymous money\". This can help bring to light the privacy issues you have talked about in your post. \n\nI think if you want to bring to light the tracking of users then more effective marketing campaign is in actively showing how easy it is to trace and correlate user activity to an address on public blockchains. Marketing materials then could be stickers that show something like \n\"What does your address say about you?\" \n\"CryptoTrackerlink\"\n\nThen you can show how that data is correlated and offer monero as the solution",

The only time I recall seeing anything resembling contention is when the RandomX fork came along and an ASIC Manufacturer tried to make it look like there was a grassroots movement to maintain the ASIC mining version of the coin. But I've not heard a peep from that project since-- they got universally panned. Everyone knew what was going on.\n\nEven if you believe that Bitcoin is the only coin that should matter, projects like Monero are still very important as they provide intense research and experimentation, and if Bitcoin does overcome them, it will become stronger doing it.\n\nIn reality I can't imagine a future where there won't be multiple coin options, with a few having the most acceptance with each pandering to different use cases, and atomic swaps running between them all.

Will Bitcoin get dethroned like the Ford Model T? I mean honestly I'm down with that, but instead Bitcoin may be like McDonalds: There's competition, but McDonalds never went anywhere. Burger King (Monero) just joined in that permanent competition of the market.\n\nWhen it comes to currencies, I'm more interested in an organic competition of currencies (like Ron Paul has supported), while the Bitcoin Maximalist philosophy seems to be more interested in establishing the one new true currency.",

As such, the core consensus protocol was altered to prevent the proliferation of asics.\n\n*Regular* hard forks have been established in Monero to prevent a standstill like Bitcoin has for years, only some cosmetic improvements like SegWit *hacked in somehow* with a lot of contortions which could have been prevented and implemented much cleaner by simply hard forking. Pretty hard to understand there can be persistent consensus on compromises which are being made in the community the months before a hard fork for many Bitcoin maximalists who literally went to war in the block size question resulting in three different chains without a real solution. This was by the way the moment I quit Bitcoin end of 2015 and found Monero with its awesome dynamic block size which is - like mining itself - driven by consensus among miners and prevents one superior entity to flood the network with insanely sized blocks (BSV). When I then discovered the privacy features, I fell in love since up to that day I *believed* in the Bitcoin narrative of a ledger having to be transparent to prevent fraud.\n\nCryptonight ASICs came up much later and pushed a bit to keep the 6-month frequency for hard forks up (with releasing changes in the mining algorithm only like two weeks upfront) until RandomX came up. Since then never touched again and still working out great! I wonder what Bitcoin would do when sha256 would be considered broken at some point? Never hard fork.\n\n>Presumably these decisions are made by a small group of insiders. Further, who decides which chain is the true monero? Because all chain splits are inherently political, we tend to observe that some alternate chains are acceptable projects while others are labeled scams.\n\nHow many people have been actively involved in the implementation of SegWit? Schnorr? Taproot? There are no public dev-meetings in Bitcoin (as of my knowledge), one can only participate in mailing lists or on GitHub where I noticed a very ignorant communication towards new people, not only from Greg Maxwell. All those changes don't split the chain, however a not updated node is off the network since it doesn't understand most of what's going on on the network. Neither Monero is splitting the network when hard forking, but it has the possibility to implement new features best possible instead of shitloads of contortions just to not split the chain.\n\n>But the authority to designate a project as legitimate or not can lead to centralization of control and influence and, in the worst case, outright coercion. Bitcoin avoids this altogether by simply refusing to accept the validity of alternate coins.\n\nConsensus by ignorance. Weren't it the same people complaining about ignorance towards Bitcoin being superior to Fiat? I don't see Monero as an altcoin, I see Bitcoin as an altcoin sometimes useful for Fiat onramp, offramp is a harder story due to its lack of fungibility.\n\nIn the long term such ignorance and Bitcoin's non-development towards privacy and scalability without again some weird contortions in form of Lightning Network which has so many technical pitfalls or scams like Blockstream's proprietary Liquid network which solves (at least a bit) both of Bitcoin's main issues privacy (with at least stealth addresses implemented) and scalability at the cost of decentralisation towards a permissioned, centralised scam controlled by banks, will eventually fail.",

This means that it is of course not only private, but also much faster and cheaper to use than Bisq. Haveno is also supposed to be simpler and more user-friendly, it has no DAO, and even uses a fundamentally different protocol for trades.\n\nIt builds heavily off of Bisq, sure.

The 2 main issues I have are 1. calling Haveno decentralized and 2. the 5 people in charge of the money, the council.\n\n1. P2P isnt the same as decentralized. Like others have pointed out, many other DEXs arent actually decentralized. My original point was that Haveno was P2P not decentralized. To draw a comparison, haveno is like localmonero, bisq, and even craigslist could in some cases be considered P2P a platform/website but they are not decentralized. \n\nMonero, bitcoin, etc are decentralized from top down for the most part. Self hosted nodes, people committing to the repo, etc. This is decentralized.\n\nCalling Haveno a DEX isnt accurate and very misleading. \n\n2. The council controls the money that the Haveno devs receive. That council is made up of 5 people who are entirely unknown to us. In my opinion that is highly centralized. (I DO NOT want this to be political, I'm just drawing comparisons) It is like calling a democracy decentralized when even though in almost every case, the people dont directly vote the president into power. It is through a few representatives that dont always represent the populace. \n\nPotential Solution: The dev team directly receiving the funds via the CCS or other means from the community would be a straight forward way to remove doubt. \n\nOr if this was just a temporary solution I might be on board but I havent seen any discussion on that.\n\nConclusion: in theory Haveno is amazing but due to the way it is currently set up I dont think I could get behind it.",

So this is more difficult with Monero.\n\nIf you need to transmit over ham radio, then I think you're going to have a difficult time receiving data on ring decoys for your transaction.

GoTennas are $200 per pair though; a Meshtastic T-beam kit (transmitting via LoRa - also unlicensed, higher frequency, potentially shorter range) at ~$30 would be more in line with the cheap device goal. S2 Underground & Ham Radio Crash Course on YouTube both have good videos on Meshtastic, digital radio modes, and other comms-related topics.\n\nAs for the actual ham bands, sure, you could devise something to transmit transactions with a $25 Baofeng handheld, but be aware that you would be running afoul of the FCC & their unpaid ham toadies. I'm not one to fuss excessively over legality, especially after the last two years of our governments willfully, maliciously, & egregiously disregarding and/or weaponizing the law against their citizens, but if you're going to be a radio pirate, be educated as to the risks involved. Hamstudy.org is an excellent resource for preparing to take the ham radio licensing exam, even if you just want the knowledge and never intend to take it. I'm somewhat of the opinion that getting licensed is an opsec liability, personally. \n\nIn this same vein, u/unsignedmark posted recently to the Preppers sub (https://np.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/tqhtgt/i_made_the_prepper_version_of_the_internet/) about his Reticulum Network Stack project, which to me seems to show significant promise, and I'd be interested to hear what he'd have to say on this question.",

He's just a shill that say milquetoast platitudes, and makes grandiose claims about BTC that aren't backed up by reality. \n\nHe's not actually a friend of Monero. You can see in his language and in everything that he says, he's trying to contain and minimize as much as possible his audience towards using Monero. Essentially implying that only in the most extreme edge cases should anyone use Monero.\n\nHe was also abou 3 years late to even saying anything good about Monero or covering it at all. He's extremely overrated, and people like him do as much harm towards Monero as they do good.",

I don't blame him for holding onto the idea that Bitcoin can be better. But it's nice to see an OG who understands why crypto currency is important acknowledge and praise Moneros pros over Bitcoin when he is very careful not to give credit to the various coins that come and go.\n\nedit: also I may have misunderstood it but from my watching of the video he said Monero is an order of magnitude more private than Bitcoin and if you need to be private from governments than you should use Monero. The one pro Bitcoin has over Monero is Liquidity and market cap. Monero is only 3 Billion Market Cap so it can be hard to move large amounts of money. Now that wont always be the case but if you needed to move money today its good to evaluate the privacy trade offs with possible liquidity issues. I don't think anyone here would disagree with that.",

There was a couple years where some maxi ideas held some water, even if they weren't water tight. Kinda like metaphorical truth, if you pretend like everything else is a scam, you're less likely to get scammed. \n\nBut those days are over, and with the hindsight of 20/20, we can see the problems, compromises, and failings piling up. It's still minimally viable for certain things. but it's anyone's guess how much that will degrade in coming years.\n\nRegarding anonymity set vs privacy, if I heard him correctly, he said that BTC has a large anonymity set because of the greater adoption, but that Monero has technologically better privacy protections in the protocol.\n\nThe problem of course is that almost no one uses coinjoin or any privacy practices at all in Bitcoin, those methods have all shown to be quite deficient, and it's hard to say that Bitcoin has any real anonymity set at all, simply because any anonymity set that you might try to count, all have significantly, multilple orders of magnitude weaker obfuscation than Monero. \n\nSo it's hard to make a good apples/apples comparison. But in reality, if I'm not mistaken, even just the hard numbers of Bitcoin transactions made with a pseudo-anonymity protocol are dwarfed by the number of trasactions happening on the Monero blockchain.\n\nAnd Aantop doesn't bother with discussing any of that nuance, and then makes just blatantly inaccurate statements regarding this simple topic, with an obvious agenda of steering people away from Monero. \n\n I kinda take this video as a nice little picture perfect reason of why I used to like and listen to him, and now I don't",

Any given $1 bill is indistinguishable from any other $1 bill, assuming both are true, Fed-printed pieces of money.\n\nGold is **not** scarce.  New sources of gold are being discovered all of the time.  While the discovery of gold has slowed over the years, it continues to be discovered and mined at the rate of [2500-3000 **tonnes** per year by current estimates](https://www.providentmetals.com/knowledge-center/precious-metals-resources/global-gold-supply-predictions.html).  That's not taking into account the amount of gold that will enter circulation when asteroid mining becomes a reality over the coming decades.\n\n**Technically**, Monero is not scarce in the sense that Bitcoin is scarce due to the tail emission.  However, this is actually something I agree with in the long term due to incentive for network upkeep, and for all intents and purposes the inflation is so small and increasingly so that it can be considered scarce.\n\nSurely Bitcoin should have a + for track record, considering literally every transaction that has ever taken place on the network is viewable and verifiable from anywhere and by anyone in the world.  As well as the fact that tumblers have essentially been rendered ineffective by crypto tracking services like CipherTrace.\n\nJust some food for thought.",

This is just one example. Today Coinbase blocks over 25,000 addresses related to Russian individuals or entities ... \n\nIt is trivial to frame someone with this kind of blockchain surveillance (BS). It also raises an interesting question: Are the BS companies subject to the sanctions also? Can they provide services to the Russian government?\n\nLet us not forget that both sides can engage in this kind of BS. Consider the following scenario:\n\n**Gulag, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag, by BS**\n\n Let us say that Alex, who lives in Russia accepts Bitcoin. James, who lives outside of Russia, hates Alex and wants to cause Alex pain. James crafts the following Bitcoin transaction with two outputs:\n\n1) One output to the address for the Ukrainian military\n\n2) A second output to Alex\n\nTo the Russian BS provider this looks like Alex made a donation to the Ukrainian military. \n\nI am a baby boomer and remember the first cold war very well. I never thought one could send innocent people to the Gulag, by tricking the KGB **from outside the Soviet Union**. One must keep in mind that Vladimir Putin is a former KGB operative.",

More Darknet market seizures and clever government bots running Tor exit nodes\n7. All western/Asian/Chinese/Russian countries get together to place an outright ban on privacy coin activity\n8. Anyone found to deal with Monero, or any source of money trailed out from Monero (e.g. Monero -> Bitcoin) will be tracked. When such Bitcoin enters a KYC exchange to be cashed out - will be frozen without reasons.\n9. Any post promoting Monero on social media; their (twitter) accounts banned - or provided up to 3 warnings, before their account is taken down.\n10. The only cash on-ramp would be via CBDCs. And direct purchase of Monero would be tracked and blocked - as much as possible.

For example:\n\n>The United States should ensure that safeguards are in place and promote the responsible development of digital assets to protect consumers, investors, and businesses; maintain privacy; and shield against arbitrary or unlawful surveillance, which can contribute to human rights abuses.\n\nIt's a \"have your cake and eat it too\" mentality. As we know here, you can have privacy for all or privacy for none, and no in between. Cryptography cannot pick and choose which transactions to make traceable based on some moral or legal standard.\n\nAlso, the text refers to \"obscured blockchain ledgers\", which sounds like another way to describe privacy coins:\n\n>Growth in decentralized financial ecosystems, peer-to-peer payment activity, and obscured blockchain ledgers without controls to mitigate illicit finance could also present additional market and national security risks in the future.  The United States must ensure appropriate controls and accountability for current and future digital assets systems to promote high standards for transparency, privacy, and security \u2014 including through regulatory, governance, and technological measures \u2014 that counter illicit activities and preserve or enhance the efficacy of our national security tools.",

Just my life experience.\n\nIf they 'ban' crypto's and service providers that do not adhere to AML/KYC/CTF what does that look like in real life? Do they go after 1 or 2 people? Put it in the newspapers and give themselves a pat on the back? A bit like the Drug War?\n\nThis is point #1 they know they can't stop it. The people using these things, already know what they are doing. And why. You will see a drop of usage with the threat of imprisonment and other things like fines or taking assets but it won't kill the space and they know it.\n\nPoint #2 is that both sides of the party left and right all want to leave routes open for themselves. You don't think the rich and powerful use cash, gold, art, wine and anonymous cryptocurrencies to do the things that they do such as evade tax and launder money? C'mon now.\n\nWhat I think they WILL do.\n\nOnce they introduce these things, in whatever manner that they do it; FED Coin, digital dollar, cbdc, whatever. I think they will purposely make it easy to transfer from crypto into their version of it, they may even offer tax incentives. I'm in Australia and currently, they tax crypto as capital gains, if they said OK, no more capital gains on crypto, but you have 2 years to xfer your crypto into our version of it, tax-free, they will not only grow usage of their new currency but they will suck up so much data it'll be unbelievable.\n\nAnd in that data will be a privacy token wallet or address that is an anonymous one. And that is when they knock on the door and demand to see what you have done with it, sucking up more data, creating more connections.\n\nThey will use this as a kind of honey pot to build their own knowledge on what is going on underground in my opinion. What they do with that is what they have always done. They will pick and choose who they go after. They will negotiate deals and get the odd criminal here and there.\n\nThey will not ban its use because they know that won't work and will instead push use further underground but instead, they will simply look for usage of these things and then come door-knocking for data.\n\nAs a side note, of course, they will use their cbdc or whatever they call it and the rules behind it to build upon their social credit system and of course, if you are caught with these things you will be put onto their naughty list. These things are a given. Its already happening, in Canada, Russia etc.\n\nJust my opinion.",

Granted, there are some features that some of us consider undesirable (such as the algorithm which is ASIC only) but I think we can all universally agree to look past these aspects that can be considered flaws and agree that the institutional adoption of Bitcoin is a great starting point. If we see more governments accepting Bitcoin as payment, we can expect the entire market to grow as well.

I am impressed with your skills and hope to see you doing css's in the future that support the Monero eco system.\n\nUnfortunately I don't think the Monero eco system should be targeting eth compatibility. AFAICT it is the antonym of the cypherpunk ideals and literally makes me sick to see how those ideals have been twisted into a centralized scam system from a decentralized privacy enhancing economic freedom goal.\n\nBillions are being washed from scamcoin launches on every centralized exchange continuously for years and if they want to wash those IL-gotten gains in monero then they should be footing the bill.\n\nWhy have you not proposed this to them? I don't want to see this becoming a precedent for all the shitcoins in the world to be getting the monero eco system to pay for their protection.",

Yes, I think you have a great point re. the scamcoins, etc.\n\nHowever, there's a lot more to this than just that negative aspect.  A big potential problem for XMR right now is the threat of delisting from major exchanges.  We've already lost Kraken UK.  Losing the rest of Kraken would be a major blow.  We need alternatives, and atomic swaps appear (to me) to be the best option.\n\nSo what does that specifically have to do with ETH in particular?  Well, there are still a large number of global users who might be interested in XMR, but who currently only have limited experience in the two biggest cryptos, BTC and ETH.  And there are still exchanges that are very limited.  Shakepay is one of the largest Canadian exchanges and currently only supports BTC and ETH.  There are lots of people around the world that only have ETH.  Think of the millions of people who are still GPU mining ETH.  A lot of them may have an interest in XMR.  In fact, some might not want to move through a CEX like Kraken even if they could, because they want to convert those mined ETH directly to XMR.\n\nAccessibility is everything.  Even if you don't support a particular type of crypto, that doesn't mean you should try to \"ban\" transactions involving that.  Banning something means censorship, and this sub should be all about protecting privacy and eliminating censorship.\n\nIf nothing else, think about this.  You like XMR.  You don't like ETH.  This atomic swap will let a person convert ETH into XMR.  Other people may feel the same way that you do.  This will help them get rid of their dirty dirty ETH and turn it into our favorite asset.",

Nobody would have an incentive to give your transaction priority if they weren't seeing the money.\n\nAny variability in fees leaks tracing information, so the obvious solution to excessive fees is to entirely eliminate variability, and force all transactions to use exactly the same fee (per byte), fixed by the protocol. Deflation is probably bad, whereas uniformity is definitely good.\n\nYou could set a target hashrate and have the fee slowly auto-adjust to maintain it. That would probably mean time stamping transactions as well as blocks, so that the consensus algorithm could keep miners from \"postdating\" blocks to make the hash rate look low. For example, you could reject any block whose timestamp was too much later than the average(?) timestamp of the transactions in that block. I think the only way to get around that would be to spam block after block with with fake transactions, thus freezing out the real transactions whose fees you were trying to collect in the first place.",

It's like playing a lottery ticket.  You'll probably never mine a block yourself, but you're still strengthening the network.\n\nRight now, when I look at the nodes distribution on [monerohash.com](https://monerohash.com) I see 2620 active nodes globally.

The first tool is exceptional government access to transactional data written on non-transparent ledgers, obfuscated by advanced anonymization cryptography. The tool should be optional for networks as long as another effective AML/CFT measures are accessible for the intermediaries or for the government in relation to a given network. If these other measures are not available and the network does not grant exceptional access, the regulations should allow governments to ***combat the development of those networks***. Effective tools in that scope should target the value of privacy-cryptocurrency, not its users. ***Such tools could include, as a tool of last resort, state attacks which would undermine the trust of the community in a specific network.***\n\nSince the Monero Project cannot and will not create a \"back door\" for government surveillance, governments may be employing this \"tool of last resort\" against the Monero community. It appears that the author of the article is a professor of law in Poland, but it may be the case that their view is widespread among Monero's adversaries.\n\nScaring away new developers is one way to weaken Monero.

Only the one who knows s_a & s_b can spend it, which is only knowable by Alice, and is revealed to her after Bob claims the ETH.\n\nThis is my quick reading of it.

Is there any parts that you are still having issues on?\nI am on twitter and matrix if you want to reach out. I have some ideas for liquidity pools and AMM for atomic swaps that work sort of like Uniswap. :\nhttps://twitter.com/Crypt0_Bear\n@crypt0_bear:matrix.org\n\nBtw I was pleasantly surprised to randomly run into your project when someone tweeted the repo on twitter.

Although not on-par with XMR privacy, it would be good to have swaps available with a more fungible coin than BTC via another coin with protocol level anonymity (as opposed to BTC which requires the use of mixers such as Samouri wallet which are expensive to use for small amounts).\n\nAlso, I think this should be a project for the future and not the present.

The only reason we are not banned is because monero is still under the radar and the focus is on Bitcoin and soon eth.\n\nSooner or later both of these might fall. And we should prepare for this.

Also 2nd layer implementations have been loosely discussed in the past.\n\nHowever, as of today it's not a focus, since the network hardly hits the 300kB \"soft\" block limit, which will activate the current onchain scaling implementation which is based on penalties applied to miners who increase block size over the median of last X blocks, so incentives are to keep it small unless there are enough \"important\" transactions to be included paying a reasonable fee. Once median block size raised, miners don't have to pay any penalty when including even low fee transactions, but unused block size lowers the median (at maximum to 300kB) again.\n\nAs a node owner and from observations I would assume we can easily scale at least x100 from here, what would mean \\~3M transactions a day without any further optimisations / code changes which would be more than x10 of BTC. Sure, blockchain growth would be at \\~5GB a day, but a node can easily prune about 80% of it and in times of streaming over Netflix eg. what is 5GB of data transfer? You also should think about that we have SSD drives below 100$ per TB and HDD even below 20$ per TB which would allow you to store almost a year of full blockchain data without even pruning.\n\nI would say we need to focus harder on scaling when we see transaction counts of Bitcoin, as of today I would rather focus on optimising privacy and also kind of scaling when making transactions smaller and/or easier to verify. Just remember, before Bulletproofs kicked in, transaction size was roughly x10, also verification time about the same and with RingCT it wasn't possible to create a transaction below 13kB.",

If people want privacy to be the default, wallets will make it the default, and the default of the actual underlying technology won't matter that much.\n\nI think you might be right.  Ethereum is pretty strong, in a large part because it has more utility (due to its broad smart contract powers and flexible ERC-20 tokens) than most other coins, including Bitcoin and Monero.\n\nNot to suggest Monero is likely to fall to Ethereum.  Monero has a strong, growing community, and I think people who are really serious about privacy will prefer a technology with strong privacy built into its core ethos.  But yeah, Ethereum could indeed be big competition, if the technology you mention can provide sufficiently strong privacy.\n\nI never saw Zcash as a terribly strong competitor to Monero.  Unlike Ethereum, it has no special draw to drive adoption.  It's basically just another mundane cryptocurrency that happens to have a privacy option.  Monero has privacy as its core ethos, rather than as a side note add on.  Also, Monero's high security default privacy means that it is more stable, because crypto gamblers can't just watch the markets for massive purchases and dumps.  That stability makes it more suitable as an everyday currency.  Currencies like Zcash (and Ethereum, for that matter) aren't very suitable for everyday spending, because their value can change quite dramatically in the time it takes to fill your cart at Walmart.\n\nThis is an aspect of privacy that is not terribly well understood but that has a massive impact on the suitability of cryptocurrencies for particular use cases.  The last thing anyone wants is for the value of their money to drop significantly while they are shopping, only to be surprised by a much higher price than expected when they get to the register.  And this volatility makes transparency coins far less useful for everyday consumer use than privacy coins that are affected far less dramatically by trading market forces.",

Spending habits can reveal a ton of things about people.  Like pregnancy.  Evidently Target's prediction system use for targeted advertising once started sending a pregnant teen ads for baby products.  The catch is, *even she didn't know she was pregnant*.  Her spending behavior changed slightly, probably due to hormones, and Target's system had noticed that the particular change was normally followed with buying infant care products in other people.  Transparency coins allow *anyone* to do that kind of analysis on *anyone*.  So nosy in-laws could get the news before you do.  Maybe spending habits could reveal that a person is looking for a new job, and an employer could use that information to threaten the employee or preemptively fire the employee, to coerce loyalty from other employees.  And do you really want *anyone* who wants to to know every time you buy condoms, laxatives, or other generally private and embarrassing products?  There is also a concern with medical privacy.  Maybe you don't want people knowing you are regularly visiting a urologist, a sex therapist, or getting chemo.  Some things are *just private*, and privacy is a *good default*.\n\nSo it's not even that every single person has something to hide from law enforcement or the government.  Most probably don't.  But *everyone* has things that are better off staying private, and privacy is a good default for keeping those things private.  (The worst thing is when everything is normally public, and then you need something be private and now everyone is suspicious of you and trying to poke around in your business to find out what it was.  Default privacy is critical in enforcing civility.)",

Now days, people seem to immediately assume privacy means hiding *crime*, but most people don't want others knowing about their sexual habits, their bathroom habits, and so on, and just knowing where and how much they are spending can reveal a *huge* amount of information about those things.  Privacy *is* a good default.  You shouldn't have to feel like you are being secretive, when you make a purchase you don't want other people knowing about, and secrecy is far less effective *when people know you are doing it*.  Privacy by default avoids all of these issues.",

                                                    "response": "Not just that.  The big thing that can save Monero from government bans is atomic swaps.  It's far to difficult for governments to enforce bans on individuals, so they would target exchanges.  As long as you can still buy Bitcoin on exchanges, you can buy Bitcoin and then use atomic swaps to trade for Monero without using an exchange.  And if Bitcoin is banned, you can use atomic trades with *other coins* to get Bitcoin, to trade for Monero.  I'm not sure how many coins have atomic trades with Bitcoin, but if even *one* of those coins can be bought on exchanges, you can trade it for Bitcoin and then trade that for *any other*, including Monero.  (Also, there is always the potential for one-on-one in-person trades of Monero for cash, goods, or whatever.)\n\nNote that Bitcoin and most other crypto coins are also anonymous (but not *private*).  Monero's privacy, however, is certainly helpful here.  If government law enforcement figures out your Bitcoin address, they can track all past and future transactions.  This would allow them to rack up a list of charges against you.  If they managed to link a Monero address to you, that's only valid for one transaction, which they will only know the amount of if they are the other party.  This means a maximum of *one charge*, and if your transactions are typically fairly small (everyday stuff), they are unlikely to go after you, because they won't get much out of it.  And of course, the privacy means it would be significantly harder to track the address to you in the first place.\n\nThe decentralization is an advantage too.  It would be easier to shut down Bitcoin ASIC mining than Monero mining, mainly because ASICs centralize a huge amount of computing power, so shutting down a handful of operations could seriously compromise the network.  Shutting down the same number of Monero \"operations\" would have no impact at all, because it's pretty much 100% individuals, each contributing only a tiny bit of mining on CPUs.  It would cost far more than it was worth to shut down much Monero mining.\n\nThe big thing though is keeping Monero useful.  What kills cryptocurrencies is losing their utility (or not having any utility in the first place).  If governments can make Monero less useful, perhaps by scaring individuals and businesses into refusing to deal it in, it will hurt Monero.  If, however, governments do things that substantially *increase* the perceived value and utility of Monero, it will thrive.  And right now, a *lot* of governments are undermining the trust of their citizens in them, which is decreasing trust in their domestic fiat currencies.  It is very possible that in our current situation, if governments start trying to ban Monero or crypto in general, that will lead to *massive* demand for the most private crypto people can find (which is Monero), and yeah, if a ton of people own significant amounts of Monero, it will be literally impossible to kill, because so many people will have a literal vested interest in its survival.\n\nAt this point, I think the U.S. is going in the right direction with crypto.  It is treating crypto income as taxable income that must be reported.  Monero is no harder to enforce reporting of than cash, and if Monero is on exchanges, the government can require exchanges to report profits from trades.  So *the* best strategy for governments would be to extend taxation to crypto earnings and dividends, so that they can continue getting their share, and strongly encourage exchanges to carry all cryptocurrencies that have significant popularity.  If they try to ban crypto, it will likely fail to have a significant effect, *and* it will ensure that people *don't* report crypto earnings, since they will get in trouble *if they do*.",

Bitcoin is very expensive and slow MONEY that totally traceable and non fungible As medium of exchange it\u2019s much worse than paper money! Instead of fixing problems Bitcoin has (fixed in Monero!!) they change narrative and start to pedal it as storage of value. \n\nIMHO not paper money not crypto money are store of value. By definition store of value suppose to survive 1000 of years and nuclear winter, so it has to be hard asset - gold land canned food guns ammo. \n\nWe must judge crypto currency on basic merit only: IS IT WORKING AS MONEY? and answer is very clear MONERO IS MONEY and Bitcoin is not",

Based on zk-snarks, so there's some question about whether or not that cryptography is backdoored, due to the intel agencies and deepstate corporations associated with zcash, who created the crypto. It's also less well reviewed than Monero's cryptography.\n\nIt's better than coinjoin; but there still exists this risk, having put your coin into a common pool, maybe there's some gray area there how exchanges might treat it. \n\nTechnologically speaking, you still have to be pretty careful after you withdraw, in order to maintain that anonymity. You need to be sending your transactions over Tor. You have to be careful about every transaction you make after removing from the pool, and whether or not it betrays information regarding your identity. I'm willing to be there's a lot of wallets out there that leak alot of metadata and fingerprints in ways that only savvy security experts are going to know about. Also, your anonymity set is still going to be pretty low. Obviously the recipient isn't masked either. \n\nYou also have the problems of Eth fees of course. So participating is an extra transaction. Expensive. \n\nIt's better that it exists than it not to exist. But it's no replacement for being solid permissionless digital money in the way that Monero is.",

So effectively, you recreate central banking. Someone has to allow you to participate in consensus, thus, it is permissioned, thus, there is no financial liberation.

Money that no one can control. \n\n>  But it is mostly the same with PoW, the rich get richer and can buy more CPU's and get more hash power.\n\nno, miners have to buy electricity.

Prior to bitcoin, one of the primary problems facing a new kind of digital money was issuance - how do you distribute this new money? The previous attempts got in trouble because, if you just create a bunch of money and then distributed it, you become a centralized entity... something the feds used to not like. Thus, satoshi used the block reward as a way to distribute the coinage of the system in a decentralized way. no one could say \"hey, you are the one creating money\". Instead, its the protocol. \n\nAnd this is still somewhat true for PoS and in general, a lot of these ICOs and other crap. They mint the money first and then distribute it. Why the feds now turn a blind eye, I dunno.\n\nBut basically, if satoshi was in todays environment where apparently the feds don't seem to care about these kinds of things, there may not have been the need to innovate in such a way, and bitcoin as we know it wouldn't have come into existence.\n\nadditionally, all these PoS coins require the existence of a healthy cryptocurrency exchange infrastructure (because, again, how do you distribute), which didn't exist when satoshi invented bitcoin.",

Compare this to ASIC miners, where you have to put up 10k worth of equipment upfront to be remotely competitive. With RandomX individuals can re-use their computer, internet connection and physical space without any extra cost. In fact in some case operation might be free, because the \"waste\" heat can be used to heat the home, lowering heating costs proportionally. So, if small scale mining has a better profit margin, market forces will push toward decentralized mining. Sure, mining farms can be feasible in regions with cheap electricity, but even they can't beat \"free\" mining.\n\nI've gone into detail in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/lv5285/alt_take_on_proof_of_stake_problem/gpacbw5/?context=3), but all the replies to the op's post are worth a read.",

Maybe I purchased them with money from the printing press my friend controlls, maybe I made them illegal and confiscated them, maybe I tax transactions with this token as a percentage of said token. Yes, it's not easy to get a lot of tokens, but once I have them, I *own* the network with *zero upkeep cost*. I may get some staking rewards, but I also get voting rights so I can exert control over the entire network, which I will definitely not use to change the rules in my favor.\n\nPoW on the other hand requires constant upkeep. You can not throw some cash at the network and own it the same way you can own PoS tokens. Sure, cash buys you hardware and you may control the network for some time, but eventually the cost and competition will overwhelm you. This is especially true with RandomX, where everyday citizens can just jump on the network and contribute their processing power instantly.\n\nThe difference is that PoS is a finite game that can be won, PoW is an infinite game that can only be played. You don't win or loose, you can only drop out if you loose the will or recources to play. Infinite games are much more resilient, as the player's goal is to keep the game running. This effort to perpetuate the game is worth the mining reward. (finite/infinite game terminology is borrowed from simon sinek, [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=simon+sinek+infinite+game))\n\nEdit: Maybe it helps to thing about this in terms of cashflow. PoS is an asset without any reoccuring cost, PoW is a liability that brings reoccuring cost any *maybe* profits. You can stay in you PoS position forever without putting any work into it, but PoW is inherently a dynamic system.",

Not yet implementing those bridges to DeFi capable blockchains and projects. Why? I think it's much too early.\n\nOne day the whole cryptoccurency universe may have matured up to a point where I can take a loan in Monero to buy a car and then pay back that loan over 5 years or so. Without anything bad happening: The price of Monero will be reasonably stable so I don't have to pay double (because my salary might still be in USD, unfortunately) for my car, the loaning entity will be trustworthy and will be still around in 5 years, and so on.\n\nOne day things might even be so stable that I can take a mortgage for my house in BTC, XMR, or whatever, and then pay back over an even longer period of, say, 20 years, and again this endevour does not descend into madness after 10 years or so, but everything moves along nicely and trustworthy, and all.\n\nOne day. This day has not yet arrived. Now is the time of boom-boost, of experimentation, of startups than crop up and vanish again, of scammers, of cryptocurrencies who bloom and later perish, and so on. I posit that now is not yet the time to invest person years of development effort to build bridges to systems that will turn out to not work, to exit-scam, to go bust, to get scammed and robbed, etc.\n\nLet's wait a few years more, see what really works and what is still standing, and **then** build the bridges.",

But the consumption of electricity to get 1000 H/s for Monero could probably get you 100MHz if you were doing it for Bitcoin. So the while the hashrate might indicate the total power consumption for a blockchain, it depends on the hashing algorithm and also the hardware being used.

There are [plenty of examples](https://wizardofads.org/reverse-psychology-and-advertising-strategy/) of advertisements making use of this technique.

For those who are hooked enough to read, it makes the reader question how some grassroots computer nerd movement could possibly weaken banks and states, two of the most powerful forces in our society.\n\nI've always liked it for this clever multi-pronged approach. All that said, there are probably better iterations of this that better fit with these times.

                    "response": ">Psychological Reactance Theory\n\n>Reverse psychology can fall under many different psychological influence techniques. Reverse psychology is sometimes referred to as\u00a0psychological reactance, which is the aroused state that occurs when a freedom is threatened or eliminated. The higher stake or more freedoms that are threatened, the more arousal that can be expected. People prefer to be free to select what they like. so when that freedom is taken away, they are motivated to restore it. Psychological reactance can be better explained as the idea that an item will be wanted more if people are told they cannot have it, which can relate to reverse psychology on some levels. Another influence technique that relates to reverse psychology is strategic self-anticonformity. Strategic self-anticonformity is when a person advocates a position that is opposite of their true thought, while hiding the fact that they are using a persuasion tactic. A common example of such is marketing techniques or tricks such as \"do not click this link,\" or \"do not push this button.\" Strategic self-anticonformity and psychological reactance relate in their expected negativity or disagreeableness from their influence target.\n\n- Wikipedia \n\nI know Wikipedia cannot be trusted for most information, so below is a more educational article.\n\n50 year review of psychological reactance theory: Do not read this article\n\nhttps://scholar.dominican.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=psychology-faculty-scholarship\n\nI recommend looking into this to get a better idea of how the \"Don't buy Monero\" advertisement is supposed to work. Or don't look into it the choice is yours.",

This impact is what makes someone more likely to look up the project and do their own research.\n\n**Appeal to og crypto ideologists**\n\nThere is a reason bitcoin was revolutionary when it came out. It was peer to peer digital money. The power it held was in an alternative from of money that could be used online without a third party needed. It's power never came from the establishment and banks backing it as their investment, it's true potential power was in creating an alternative system that would be more fair than the monopoly that central banks currently held and abused at the expense of most people. \n\nThis idea is what brought about most of the early users of bitcoin. It is still the same value proposition that bitcoin holds but it has been watered down as nothing more than marketing material for selling financial products around bitcoin. The thing is, there are still people looking for what bitcoin promised as the future in the early days. This ad targets those users and forces them to look into doing their own research. Which is all that Monero ads should strive for. \n\n**I would make one change**\nI would change \"cryptocurrencies\" and change it to \"anonymous money\". This can help bring to light the privacy issues you have talked about in your post. \n\nI think if you want to bring to light the tracking of users then more effective marketing campaign is in actively showing how easy it is to trace and correlate user activity to an address on public blockchains. Marketing materials then could be stickers that show something like \n\"What does your address say about you?\" \n\"CryptoTrackerlink\"\n\nThen you can show how that data is correlated and offer monero as the solution",

                    "response": "This is the way!\n\n>\nCrypto\nHome/Crypto\n\nThank you for your interest in crypto currency and Helicon Brewing!\n\nWe have created this FAQ to address questions of any potential crypto customers. If you have a question or concern that is not addressed below, please let us know! Questions and comments can be emailed to crypto@heliconbrewing.com.\n\nQ: How does paying a bill work?\n\nA: Paying with cryptocurrency at Helicon Brewing is easier than paying with a credit card. When the time comes to pay your bill, simply let the bartender know that you would like to pay with crypto and the crypto type; for example, Monero (XMR). The bartender will generate a receipt showing the amount of the chosen cryptocurrency due and a QR code for the deposit address. You will then deposit the amount due at the printed deposit address. After a brief interval, the length of which depends upon the type of cryptocurrency used, the bartender will get a notification of the deposit and close out the bar tab.\n\nQ: How does tipping work?\n\nA: The printed receipt will show the amount of crypto owed to pay the bill and will also show some suggested tip percentage amounts. Any amount of overpayment above the total due will automatically become a tip for the staff.\n\nQ: Does it cost anything to pay with cryptocurrency?\n\nA: It is actually cheaper to pay with cryptocurrency! To incentivize our guests to consider paying with cryptocurrency, we apply a 2% discount to all purchases made with cryptocurrency. The transaction fees are paid by the customer\u2013these are based on the type of cryptocurrency and are usually very small.\n\nQ: Which cryptocurrencies do you currently accept?\n\nA: At this time we accept Monero (XMR), Ripple (XRP), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Nano (NANO), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Dash (DASH), Litecoin (LTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nQ: Will you consider ever accepting <insert unsupported crypto type here>?\n\nA: Maybe! Adding a new cryptocurrency to our list is trivial. The one limitation is that we can only accept cryptocurrencies supported by Kraken. If you have a cryptocurrency that you are looking to spend, please let us know!\n\nQ: Why do you use Kraken?\n\n1) They support the cryptocurrency Monero.\n\n2) They are by all accounts the most reputable and fair exchange that exists today with among the lowest transaction fees and minimum deposit requirements.\n\n3) Their API to access deposit information is key to this all working. It is possible that Binance or other exchanges will be added in the future.\n\nQ: What program are you using to accept cryptocurrency payments?\n\nA: The owner of Helicon Brewing, Chris Brunetti, was a software developer before opening the brewery. He has written the entirety of the code himself.\n\nQ: Can my business be set up to accept cryptocurrency?\n\nA: Yes! We need some time to fully stress test the code. Once it is ready, it should be straightforward to get new businesses set up. If you would like to be added to our list of businesses interested in accepting cryptocurrency payments, please email us at crypto@heliconbrewing.com.\n\nQ: How is the exchange rate for cryptocurrency payments determined?\n\nA: At the time the request is made to pay the bill, the software obtains the current \u201cask\u201d price from Kraken. This rate is printed on each bill. If the customer is unhappy with the rate, they may choose instead to pay with cash or a card. Helicon Brewing reserves the right to not accept a particular cryptocurrency for any reason most notably if it is a volatile day.\n\nQ: What do you do with your cryptocurrency you receive as payments?\n\nA: We cash out the vast majority of the crypto we receive every evening and use it to pay our bills. Except for Monero\u2013we transfer that to our Trezor Model T conveniently located on our boat.\n\nQ: You mention Monero a lot, why?\n\nA: We believe that when the dust settles, the scams are over, the rug pulls are done, and adoption is significant, Monero will be the best and most popular cryptocurrency out there. The details are beyond the scope of this FAQ, but we\u2019d love it if you stopped in to talk about it!",

Partly because I don\u2019t view nominal price appreciation relative to fiat as something that is or will be unique to Monero. But also because greed is based in fear. So likewise I don\u2019t tell people dystopian visions of the future to convince them of Moneros merits. Where I tend to start is with \u201cthe money printer\u201d, and the endless varieties of corruption that have emerged because of this. To me Monero represents a chance at correcting many of these problems, an opportunity to actually progress beyond humanities current history-on-repeat loop regarding money, and a shot at having a more just society. I\u2019m not into Monero out of fear, I\u2019m into Monero out of a sense of determined optimism that we can steer the course of civilization back into the right direction.",

For something like Bitcoin, which is digital *gold*/a store of value, then sure it makes sense to have a capped supply. But for *currency,* you don't want a fixed supply. More Monero is already lost than is being mined, so it's already slightly deflationary. A lot of people have gone into depth about why the tail emission is better than a fixed supply for currency, you can probably search \"tail emission\" in this sub and find plenty of results. I think localmonero also has an article on it, as well as sethforprivacy.\n\nBTC is what happens when you refuse to upgrade. Maxis go through absurd mental gymnastics to justify even the most simple shortcomings of Bitcoin, like the high fees, the bandaid non-solutions of the lightning network and segwit, the ugly soft forks, etc. And its only been a *decade*, I can't even want to imagine what it'll be like by the turn of the century. I suppose that since we're talking about a \"perfect\" currency then no such shortcomings would exist. But in anything resembling reality, having the ability to patch bugs, upgrade the network, etc are non-negotiable. An immutable protocol would be like swearing to only use MS-DOS for the rest of your life in the '80s and then being surprised that it's now outdated and generally unusable today in 2022.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd also add to the list that a node should be extremely easy to run. Maybe everyone could run a node on their phone in the background, sipping a fraction of a percent of its resources. The \"perfect\" currency is one which can run off of a smart toaster. This may actually become reality in the somewhat-distant future as technology advances exponentially.",

You do so because we already know (or believe to know) about quantum computers. But what about zero-field energy computers? Ok, ok, I totally made those up, but you may get my point: You simply don't know what's coming, especially over decades.\n\nOr we can through favorable circumstances become a multiplanetary species much faster than anticipated.

I agree, BTC has a larger network effect and wider adoption currently, but personally, I do NOT want everyone to know what I\u2019m doing with my money and to have them know how much I own. Additionally, possessing dirty bitcoins might incriminate a person even if they did not commit a crime. Let\u2019s look at the current situation in Canada where they flagged their bitcoins.

Yea, some are coin joining but still why go through all that hassle and still not be fungible even after a coinjoin\n\n2- Who the hell wants to pay high transactions fees?? Sure btc transaction fees are low right now at 30-40 cents per transaction but everyone knows damn well once it starts to get congested again (which it will due to the btc devs not enlarging the block size) fees will start to cost $3 then $6.  I\u2019ve seen them go up to $20 before\u2026 XMR is designed to have minimal fees possible for EVER!! that means that XMR can hit $1,000,000 and fees can potentially still be 1 penny\n\n3- Do you actually believe most of the people know the difference between BTC,XMR or even DodgeCoin?? Hell freaking no!!! All they care about is which coin is going to fill their bags with Fiat and get it swallowed up by inflation later\u202699% of BTC content out there is just number go up Bulls*** \u2026.XmR community is well informed and we know the true value of XMR \u2026 I would always prefer XMR over some expensive, slow, surveillance coin for the simple fact that  I know damn well XMR is what we thought BTC was when we first bought it.\n\nLastly, as for network effect this is the way i see it. what\u2019s better??? 1,000 miners mining at a total network hashrate of 100th/s (btc example)\u2026.or 1,000,000 miners mining at a total network hashrate of 10th/s? (Xmr example) How safe is this?? And if we do reach that \u201csafe number\u201d is it really decentralized? \n*** those numbers about hash rate and miners are figuratively speaking, those aren\u2019t actually numbers but the main thing I am trying to get across is that not everyone can afford a $10k asic to mine BTC \u2026 now anyone fan mine XMR with their laptops***",

Granted, there are some features that some of us consider undesirable (such as the algorithm which is ASIC only) but I think we can all universally agree to look past these aspects that can be considered flaws and agree that the institutional adoption of Bitcoin is a great starting point. If we see more governments accepting Bitcoin as payment, we can expect the entire market to grow as well. Monero is my favorite coin due to my use case and personal beliefs and I think Bitcoin is a great starting point for novices due to its simplicity and widespread adoption.

If you're only just now looking into Monero, you might ask yourself what factors are relevant for if/why there was a delay for you personally.

Most of the big talking heads also ignore it. I believe that the power hungry players in crypto ignore XMR for two main reasons:\n\n1. Chain analysis. These guys are running multi-billion dollar per year chain analysis industry. And a coin like Monero invalidates their multiple chain-analysis business models. \n\n2. No premine, no ASICs, no block reward diversions. I can't think of any other coins that crypto whales/exchanges didn't get a huge bag for free (or nearly for free). When they sell people tokens they got on the cheap, that's huge profit for them.\n\nUltimately I think it can essentially be explained by profit and power.

Yes and no, the inflation is really low (below 1% currently) and will forever go lower. So technically it will devaluate XMR by less than 1% per year, but who cares. It's the price to pay to keep low fees. All fiat currencies devaluate faster than that.Also don't forget that a lot of crypto is lost forever all the time because of the users dying or losing their keys, thus acting as a deflationary force.\n4. I'm not as optimistic as the cultist people here want me to be.  \nI think it will be banned for use everywhere because it inconveniences the banks and the governments, and that it will continue to be mostly used for criminal activity (drug trade, tax evasion, marital asset hiding, political activism, etc) for as long as it's the most private and safe way to transact.  \nIt is possible that Monero will be \"integrated\" in a state financial system like Salvador does with Bitcoin or Russia with other cryptos, but in order to use those cryptos legally you need to identify yourself, allow yourself to be spied on, and go through their system, which defeats the entire point of Monero in the first place.",

                    "response": "Good questions, welcome to the Monero family!\n\n1. Monero has no soft forks, but regular hard forks to roll out better tech for privacy and usability. It used to be every six months, but consensus among currently active developers, researchers and the community in Monero (you are welcome to join any of those groups and take a voice) is that they will be less often in the future, if not needed, since it requires all wallets, exchanges and merchants to upgrade their software. Last hard fork has been more than a year ago in October 2020 and next one is scheduled to be somewhere in April/May 2022. Why hard fork? To enforce the best privacy for all transactions so they are as indistinguishable from each other, unlike in Bitcoin you have e.g. old format addresses, new format, segwit or not, taproot or not, ...\n2. The major mining incentive is block rewards to ensure a healthy hash rate, no matter how many usage there is at a certain point. Tho fees will go up a bit by x5 in the next hard fork, but they are designed to be low in the long run. There is no fixed block size but a dynamic one, which can be slowly adjusted by miners. To create a larger block than the standard block size of 300kB every \\~2 minutes, a miner has to pay a penalty of his block reward, which has to be paid up by transaction fees. The function is quadratic, so raising the block size by 10% will result in only 1% penalty, 50% in 25% and finally 100% in 100% penalty. The current limit is counted against the median of the last 100 (and 10,000) blocks and once this raises, this is the new limit without penalty. Fees paid in XMR will equally go down with higher block size, so doubled usage means half of the fees. However, you can't predict markets and fiat prices.\n3. The inflation of gold is \\~1-2% per year for now hundreds of years and gold still holds its value in comparison to other mediums of exchange. A strictly deflationary system is probably never be a good medium of exchange and one could argue that is the only use case for cryptocurrency. If you know a money is deflationary, you will prefer to spend anything else but not this money, but then again you disqualify it to be money, when nobody is using it and we will not see more adoption in the real world. Sure, you can make a new narrative like Bitcoin did into \"Digital Gold\" but scarcity is not a guarantee to be somehow valuable in the long run. Gold has real demand for jewellery, technology and religion while one could argue nobody needs Bitcoin in the end, when it's not an adopted medium of exchange.\n4. That's also hard to predict, however we see more and more real adoption outside the darknet, one of the best examples is [Coincards](https://twitter.com/CoinCards/status/1489760991818633216), but also Travala accepting it. When it comes to hosting, domains or VPS we see more and more adding it, otherwise we have 'proxy-like' shops like [Proxysto.re](https://digitalgoods.proxysto.re/) to onboard those who have not yet implemented it natively. However, from my experience if you kindly ask shop accepting Bitcoin, most of them will also accept Monero manually. Russia is not considering Bitcoin, but crypto and not as a currency, but as of my understanding to regulate it at all, since as of today it's kind of grey market. It will be hard for regulators to allow transparent coins but not privacy focussed ones. Where is the barrier? What about Lightning Network and CoinJoins? If you ban those, you kill Bitcoin as a whole, since no merchant has access to chain-analysis tools and can't determine if coins he receives are tainted or not. Not a problem with Monero btw. - so Monero has actually the potential to become a currency while I doubt Bitcoin has. Sure, it will take another 10 years or longer (if ever), but hey, the world is transforming at such a speed, that you can't predict what 'social' network will be 'next', TikTok's usage is skyrocketing while Youtube is flattening, the former only founded 4 years ago. There can be a single important event causing Monero's usage to skyrocket, while I don't see such a possiblity for Bitcoin - alone from fee perspective & privacy. LN is no solution if non-custodial matters (and that's the kind of events I would expect) since it's an interactive protocol requiring both parties to be connected (and that might become a problem when crypto might become important).\n\nDisclaimer: I've been in Bitcoin since 2012, bought my first 1 BTC for $15 paid with Liberty Reserve on some obscure service. After the block size wars I left the space for \\~2 years until I discovered Monero in 2015/16 and well, I'm still around...",

I think our test-net wownero has already banned pool mining.\n\nAt this point of where Monero stands it would be really interesting, since we'd probably loose a lot of HR from multi-coin pools optimising profitability and also botnets. However, profitability would skyrocket for p2pool miners and I think at least some would switch to p2pool only, which in the long term might bring a decent decentralisation and thus security, since HR would probably come back to \"rational\" levels, where mining is profitable at normal electricity costs.",

Your apps will flat-out stop to work if you don't adapt\", but then does **not** publish those changes in a timely manner.

There's a few things that he has just slightly wrong, and they can all be addressed with ...\n\n2. A proper cryptocurrency is a *digital bearer asset*. \n\nI understand the magnitude of such statements might be lost on most people, so let me elaborate ...\n\nCrypto is not muh store of valor. A store of value can't oscillate by 5-10x within less than half a year. You could come back to madgainz, or you might come back to 10 cents on the dollar. \n\nCrypto obviously isn't a currency. Maybe one day it could be, but it's definitely not. Neither is it gold. Monero comes the closest to the digital gold idea; but again, it's too volatile, and gold was established first via its transactional usage for thousands of years.  This is again why Monero comes closest, because of it's fungibility and (limited) transactional usage. But it's still a tenuous comparison for now. Maybe that will change one day. \n\n### Okay, so let's get back digital bearer asset\n\nCrypto was the first time the world had ever seen the ability to hold a *digital asset* where access to your funds wasn't predicated on the agreement of some bank, broker, or govt. That's really powerful. Cash is a bearer asset. Gold is a bearer asset. They even used to have bearer bonds and bearer equity certificates, but that was phased out due to muh terrorism and money laundering. \n\nHere we make a comparison. The notion of a *digital* bearer asset is so fundamentally good and useful, that cyclical schemes of fraud and speculation can be built on top of it; destroyed and washed away, and then built again. Yet crypto remains. The very first one still runs to this day, and for all its failings, still exists as the largest.\n\nThe comparison then, is to equities (the stock market). The notion of holding an ownership stake in a company is so fundamentally good and useful, that they can forever blow bubbles and manipulate the shit out of the stock market. Crash it all; only for it to come back larger. \n\nIn both cases, whether equities or digital bearer assets; the foundation is strong enough to survive the fraud. And humans just love them some fraud. It's actually the 3 or 4 massive fraud induced bubbles in crypto, yet it's still here, that's the strongest case for demonstrating its strength. \n\nAnd this is where guys like in this video go wrong. They see the fraud and they come to the wrong conclusions, because they haven't been able to properly nail down what exactly is being accomplished with crypto. And so they mistakenly make crypto and fraud synonymous. They miss the more fundamental precept. \n\nIt's actually one of those times that a very subtle miss, causes a very large mistake.  It happens because no one informed them of the actual truth of matters; so eventually they reject an idea on the basis of the bad arguments that the proponents made for it. I tell this to you, Monero, because if we have *better* arguments, it sets us apart; just like everything else about Monero.\n\n\nMonero aint going away, and even though I don't like it too much anymore, neither is Bitcoin. Fraud be damned, bubbles be damned. The fundamental nature of it (at least *some* of it) is so good that it'll be here forever now.",

So from my understanding, the main points are\n\n* fiat is backed by governments\n* cryptocurrency is not\n* therefore, cryptocurrency = bad.\n\n<walloftext>\n\nCryptocurrency is backed by the laws of mathematics, fiat is backed by promises made by people who are notorious for breaking promises. Fiat is a piece of paper which was arbitrarily declared to have value by the very same entity which controls, manufactures, and administers it. Cryptocurrency is trustless, provably consistent, and secured by a global decentralized network of incentivized users instead of distant, greedy, corrupted, and manipulative politicians. Venezuela, Zimbabwe, or the Weimar Republic is not some natural phenomenon. Those situations are the *direct result* of having fake, unbacked currency.\n\nNow, this person is trying to argue that cryptocurrency is worthless because it's just 1's and 0's which happen to be valued by the users (which is arguably not even true, it's much more complex than that), but by this logic, nothing can have value. Gold is just a pretty rock, who cares? The value of gold, of course, comes from the fact that society values it, and from the fact that it is a scarce resource. All currencies are nothing more than a societally-agreed-upon way to make trade easier. That's the ENTIRE POINT of currency. He argues that fiat has value because big daddy gubermint said so, but why the fuck do we listen to them? And where do you think the government itself receives its societal legitimacy from in the first place? At least gold is provably scare, but even that is relatively unstable compared to the mathematical precision of crypto. Fiat, on the other hand, is literally just a piece of paper.\n\nThe only half-decent argument made here is the issue of adoption. Cryptocurrency is currently treated as an investment, not a currency, and as a result the price is volatile. This disincentivizes businesses from accepting it, which results in a catch 22. This is admittedly a real issue, but this is no fault of the invention itself (it brings us back to the problem of societal valuation), and we have to remember that cryptocurrency is still in its infancy. Crypto could not replace fiat by tomorrow obviously, but it's barely a decade old at this point, and only mainstream within the last few years. It takes time.\n\n</walloftext>  \n\n\n**TLDR**: all of the arguments made against crypto are true for fiat as well, and to a much larger extent. Not to mention the innumerable issues with fiat, ones which crypto is completely immune to. This person clearly doesn't understand cryptocurrency very well.",

They make a note of the outputs which these criminals spent, send them to all of the exchanges in their jurisdiction, and announce that purchasing any of those outputs will be aiding criminal activity. You end up with these coins because you sold some guy your old computer. He got the coins from his nephew who bought them from an exchange that the criminals sold to before the coins were blacklisted. You unwittingly try to sell them on an exchange. Not only does the exchange refuse to buy your coins, but they send your name to law enforcement. Law enforcement quickly find out after questioning you that you had nothing to do with it, but they seize your coins.\n\nAs another example, suppose you use your coins to buy a gaming PC online with an account you share with your spouse. The store uses a chain analysis service and finds that one of the outputs you used to buy the gaming PC was change from an output used to buy a premium pornography subscription. They start putting ads in your account for hentai pillows, which is embarrassing and annoying.",

So one may want to be cautious with that.\n\nI've lost funds too from exchanges that just flag/freeze your account and then KYC the sh\\*t out of you until you get to a point where you can no longer provide documentation or evidence to support your story and they just confiscate your funds indefinitely.

I don't think the bank account metaphor works here b/c my bank absolutely knows who I am and the details of all  of my accounts are  known to many parties.  KYC/AML necessitate that.  There's no notion of Private transactions,  for those we use \"Cash\" but the contents of our digital accounts are open to countless parties so it would indeed be weird to call it a 'private  bank account'.  If you  have offshore accounts, you absolutely differentiate between them and standard bank accounts.  Many of us not only use offshore accounts but also keep assets in trusts b/c it's no one's business what we own , again to obscure ownership and retain privacy b/c standard back accounts are quite clear.\n\nBlockchain by its nature is public.  A whole lot of people think Blockchain/esp BTC is anonymous. I can't even count all the times I've heard some anti-blockchainer thinking they are dunking on Crypto b/c the government retrieved stolen btc or seized it.\n\nSure, anyone involved enough to use it should know the use case, but it's a big differentiator and a feature.  Secure Connections, Encrypted Emails, all of them offer protections above and beyond the default.    \n\n\n***As a community I think we should be YELLING \"THE GOVERNMENT KEEPS SECRETS FROM US, WHY IS IT NOT OK TO HIDE THINGS FROM THEM?\" I think we should all be very aggressive about how bad our privacy has been invaded and Start being PROUD OF wanting it instead of being punked by \"If you don't have anything to hide what's the problem.\"  Between DOXXING, mistaken identity, scammers, sim theft etc, people should NOT SHY AWAY FROM SAYING \"I'm not doing anything wrong, I have the presumption of innocence, F\\*CK OFF if you have a problem with that\"***",

Being an absolute stranger in the crypto world (and being someone coming from the arts, not from computer science), I didn't know anything about these subjects.\n\nHaving the curiosity about how everything works, I thought that maybe it can be better to read not only about technical subjects but also the history of money (to know about the whole evolution about currencies) and other things such as political views about it, or how cryptocurrencies can help to survive people from latinamerican and other countries that are f**** by authoritarian governments.\n\nAbout this last subject, I try to talk about it in a \"neutral\" way, by citing economic and political theories. For example, the State having no correct incentives \"for doing the right thing\" (and showing different cases in Latinamerica, where that leads \"naturally\" to corruption). Or, another thing I extensively wrote is about the fallacy of the broken window and the refutation of the argument about the State as the only entity capable of providing security (and the sophism that stipulate private security wilk lead to a mafia-like organizations)... All of these subjects, coming from the scenario where a community lives using Monero as a mean of exchange and eliminating the taxes (and also demonstrating about its coercive nature)",

                    "response": "Monero is hard to get. On a relative basis, especially if you're concerned about not going KYC to get it. It's not too bad but you have to get crypto in the first place which is riddled with KYC.   \n\n\nI presume the short selling or selling of Monero that doesn't exist plays a role too.   \n\n\nAlso this whole \"market\" has many similarities with religious dogmatic thinking but even without that, i'd say 85% of people have no freaking clue about cryptography (I'm nearly in that group haha) and they just chase price and there's an understanding that Monero won't make you rich like cumdotpolkashibucake coin will.   \n\n\n& Finally, Monero is another necessary tool like Gold and Silver that just fits for the macroeconomic, political, psychological, financial and legal times we're in... a history book (or a few) screams the importance of precious metals and something like Monero but most people have been indoctrinated to learn nothing of history, of philosophy & human psyche nor anything about monetary policy and government has played such an integral role in their lives many love being a good little whipped dog.   \n\n\nSo, corruption on exchanges, lack of exchanges (supply), lack of realization that it's important and also lack of purchasing it CaUz iT dUzn'T MooN brO! (lack of demand).   \n\n\nI've been selling stickers (DM if you want any) as an awareness tool but It definitely does go deeper. It seems like the exchanges and swaps are making headway in development but I guess just making people aware not of crypto but of the larger risks to wealth and it becomes easier to understand where XMR fits in that problem. The MoneroRun thing is kind of neat too. I guess it's painful now but if no exchanges sell XMR it forces us to have our own little commune elsewhere.",

But that doesn't necessarily make them all good.\n\n* Zcash - trusted setup (must trust the developers to not be malicious or abuse their power, could generate infinite undetectable coins), centralized, controlled by a corporation & CEO, vast majority of transactions are non-private, aims to be \"too traceable for criminals\", has a dev tax, and little to none real-world adoption. Ztrash also has many, **many**, other issues, but these are the big ones.\n* Pirate Chain - fixes a lot of the issues with Zcash, but still has a trusted setup, a very bad emission curve (90% mined in 3 years), and little adoption. Also the name \"Pirate Chain\" is garbage. Definitely a huge improvement though, and probably my second favorite privacy coin behind Monero. Although that's not saying much, considering its competition.\n* Dash - not really a privacy coin, but everyone seems to think it is. Basically just Bitcoin with more centralization and an emphasis on coinjoins, but still very traceable and no-one uses the opt-in privacy. I used to think Dash was a decent project that just isn't focused on privacy, but recently I've heard some things that make me think it might be a borderline scam.\n* Dero - don't know much about it, but is using audited cryptography (extremely risky and unprofessional), has had some accusations of stealing code, relies on a lot of buzzwords for attention, shills spread blatant propaganda about Monero, and is more of a smart contract platform than a currency (not necessarily a bad thing, just not the same purpose).\n* DeepOnion - literally just uses Tor, that's the only thing private or unique about it, and calls itself a privacy coin for that.

If both, how much does it like one over the other?\n\nDoes a 5800 X3d with its 96 mb of L3 cache give someone triple  the Monero mining profits  fo a regular 5800X, with it's 32 mb of L3 cache?\n\n***Monero mining  likes L3 cache and fast/low latency RAM.***\n\nthe only thing I do not know is about  the cache question of does it scale linearly  with the size of cache, or does tripling the L3 cache only get you to, oh  I don't know,  lets say 150% more than  a 5800X profits (assuming RAM is equal in such a comparison )  or would it get you 300% of the profits of a  5800X, because it has 300% more L3 cache?\n\n/u/Atlas_from_the_North\n\nGo look at the Monero mining benchmarks. they show  you all the CPUs benchmarked, shows the hashrate, and it  shows which RAM they  used.  The best hashrate for a 5800X is that list I saw,  for one example, was about 12000 h/s. My 5800 get s  about 9400 h/s  at best, and that's when I am not moving the mouse around or doing too much other stuff with the PC. When I do,  the 9400 h/s  can drop down to 7000, sometimes even to 5000... and once  in a while  it goes  to zero until I restart NiceHash \n\n(( oh yeah, I use NiceHash because my disability prevents  me from learning technical stuff sometimes. NiceHash is easy. I  WANT to use other Monero mining software, but  I have Tinnitus and facial neuralgia in my left temple and TMJ and Hyperacusis, all on that left side,  and it can be hard to learn new  things ever  since  an injury  caused this permanent disability ) )",

Considering the rest of the system costs the same for both CPUs, the 5950X system will be the cheapest per core. (And if you're investing $50,000, you'll be happy to have 25% fewer systems :D)\n\nI have a Ryzen 5 2600 and it seems to me that running more than 1 RandomX thread per core increases the hashrate only if both run on different SMT instances. The 2600 has 2 CCXs with 3 cores and 8 MB of L3 each. Cores 3, 4 and 5 are the three cores of the second CCX, cores 9, 10 and 11 are their second thread (SMT). I've run a few benchmarks (my numbers might seem a bit low, that's because I underclocked to 3.5 GHz and undervolted as far as possible - this is the efficiency sweet spot in monero mining for my system and it's still fast enough for everything else I do with it):\n\n|List of active cores|H/s|\n|:-|:-|\n|11|745|\n|11, 11 (same core, same SMT thread)|745|\n|5, 11 (same core, different SMT thread)|1011|\n|5, 11, 11|1013|\n|11, 11, 11|743|\n|10, 11 (2 different cores)|1485|\n|9, 10, 11 (the whole 2nd CCX)|2203|\n|5, 9, 10, 11 (2nd CCX, maxing its L3)|2365|\n|4, 5, 9, 10, 11 (not enough L3)|2164|\n|3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11 (even more L3 overload)|2020|\n|6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 (one thread per core)|4350|\n\nSo you see: running more than one thread on the same CPU SMT thread does not increase performance (at least for Zen+). Filling up the L3 with SMT threads (if it can fit more threads than you have cores) is worth it, but in my practical experience only if you mine while not using the PC. As soon as some other software runs, the L3 is overloaded and the last configuration in the table is actually the fastest.\n\nSo if this translates to Zen3, the 5800X3D is a waste of money for monero mining because it can only really compute 16 threads and use 32 MB of L3 while doing so, the other 64 MB of L3 will not help you much at all. Also, the 5900X will not be as fast as the 5950X even if it has the same amount of cache. Furthermore, the 5950X is binned better and actually uses less power under full load than the 5900X (at least in Gamer's Nexus's benchmarks).\n\nBut maybe Zen3 is totally different than I think; I only have hands-on knowledge of Zen+. Can you run a few benchmarks to see how it compares? Just edit the \"rx\": \\[ ... \\] line in config.json, xmrig will automatically detect any changes when you save the file. Then let it run for \\~15 seconds and press \"h\" to see the average hashrate of the last 10 seconds. That's not too precise, but more than enough to see such big performance differences. You can copy the line with your original setting and comment it out by putting // in front of it.",

Check out the monero-bash project, which makes this ultra easy to get going.\nb) Start with one unit and see for yourself what your profitability is on electricity consumption, and how long to offset hardware cost (factoring in hardware lifespan, i.e. replacement rate). Only then should you commit the full 50K.\n\nThe nice thing is that, should you find that the experiment fails and it's not profitable, you have two pretty good options:\na) Resell the hardware. Since it will be general consumer grade, it won't be hard to find a buyer if you cut below the retail price.\nb) Hang on to the setup until Monero's price climbs. Block reward will basically remain static from here on, meaning that a doubling in price in a few months may just change the whole equation for you. You'll be ready to jump in immediately.",

                            "response": "You're on the right line of thinking. I'll try to supplement with what I believe is the technically correct answer.\n\nAny exchange that wants to manipulate prices over the long term, needs to be the exchange with the highest real volume, or needs to collude with multiple exchanges to have the highest real volume combined.\n\nOtherwise, what happens is that as they try to suppress price and force it down with fake sells on their platforms, other exchanges acting honestly, don't have commensurate XMR sells on their platforms. So price drops on the lying exchange, and stays the same on honest exchanges (maybe even goes up).\n\n Then arbitrators come in to even out the price, and the exchange who runs out of liquidity first, is forced to end up pegging to the exchange with higher real volume. Either that, or if they're *really* deadset on suppressing price, they can eat the arbitration loss themselves, but it costs them money to do so.\n\nSo for example, let's say that users on Binance are leaving, withdrawing their XMR. Binance is now low on liquidity to meet withdraws. Meanwhile, lets say that people are buying on Kraken, and price is rising over there, but Binance is rigging their prices, just saying that the price is lower.\n\nNow the arbitrators come in and try to withdraw cheap XMR from Binance, to sell at a higher price on Kraken and pocket the difference. If Binance (and their cohorts at Poloniex, Bitfinex, et al), can't come up with the Monero to meet withdraw demand, then Binance loses, then one of two things happens. \n\nEither they peg their price to Kraken, and start buying Monero at an even higher price, to continue meeting customer demand, or they freeze withdraws. In which case, no one regards their price as accurate or reliable. You might see a price divergence develop, especially on places like Bisq, Havano, Kraken, etc. There might be faku volume, but they progressively erode themselves into XMR irrelevance. No genuine DEX, CEX, or individual will accept a lower quote from Binance, when they can get a better price elsewhere.\n\nSo hopefully that illustrates why the exchange(s) with higher real (honest) volume end up setting the price.\n\nWhich is why we're making this big push. If we can get enough people off these fractional reserve exchanges, we might get some positive price discovery. The trick that Binance and others have used, is the fact that probably only a fraction of people ever withdraw their XMR at any given time. \n\nIt means they can sell a claim on XMR that doesn't exist, without having reduced the supply of real Monero on the open market.\n\n If we can get enough people to call their bluff, and just withdraw what they already bought, probably many months ago, then yes, we're essentially successful on what will probably look like a multi phase approach. \n\nPhase two will be for us to populate the upcoming DEXes with real volume and liquidity, maybe combined with another Monerun push.",

But the consumption of electricity to get 1000 H/s for Monero could probably get you 100MHz if you were doing it for Bitcoin. So the while the hashrate might indicate the total power consumption for a blockchain, it depends on the hashing algorithm and also the hardware being used.

As a decentralized protocol itself it is extremely to ban. The government will not try to waste time on fighting with thousands of monero nodes across the world or try to arrest the devs and plant backdoors, it will kill crypto using the cheapest and easiest way for it which is administration orders and regulations.\n\nThe government has very little power in crypto space, however the government can easily control the traditional fiat gateways and tools. No matter how secure and anonymous crypto is, people always need to cash out, and this conversion channel can be easily killed by the government. Once this channel is dead or hard enough for normal people to access, crypto is doomed or almost useless because what you can do with your crypto is highly limited.\n\nThe example is China. CCP has successfuly built a highly sophisticated surveillance nightmare that even Snowden cannot imagine. All online fiat payment tools are under strict KYC regulations which means mandatory facial recognition + bank account verification(you need to physically go to a bank to open an account which is almost impossible to counterfeit). Techniques used for fighting credit card fraud is well utilised here, it will mercilessly kill any login attempt that seems suspicious. A login attempt from labeled anonymous proxies will instantly kill the account, and other suspicious activities like attempt to start the software in vm or sort of thing will also raise fraud score and might leads to account suspension in the future. If the account is suspended it is very unlikely to recover access. The AML is also insane, especially crypto trading will trigger AML alert very easily. The police has a skynet like database which has the information of everyone's online activities including all the accounts(almost all accounts requires KYC because all registrations require phone number and phone number has bank account level KYC), contacts and transaction relationships. It is very easy for the police to map the crypto related accounts and label them as dangerous(sometimes the police even disguise as p2p traders to find out who is buying crypto). When enough AML alerts are triggered a person's all online accounts can be frozen together and becomes digitally dead, which means you cannot pay for train ticks, rent a house and need to use cash for eating out. This 1984 style regulation is powerful enough to deter 95% of people from using any crypto.\n\nAlso no need to mention it is illegal for merchants to accept crypto, so direct crypto payment also do not work. Finally the government has network surveillance on provincial routers and national GFW. It detects any crypto related network activity and disconnect them from the Internet, my friend is banned from using network and called by the police because he tried to mine using his gaming GPU at home. Even it is not possible to kill all the offshore node servers, they can be easily blocked plus using an active firewall that probes all the potential proxy servers and kill vpns to further increase the cost of settings up a working crypto wallet.\n\nIt is impossible to fight the government with simply some  Internet tools, a political problem needs a political solution, since the government ultimately controls the ISP and financial infrastructure and can block access.It is just a cost problem for them not to block something. The problem is democratic system fails to restrict the power greedy government and the old western liberty dies out. It should be solved by figuring out how to properly regulate the power itself.",

So what they do is take the probability that the tagged output is included as a decoy in an average transaction (very low), subtract that from 100, and use that as their answer (99.99%+). That's not the actual probability though, because \"the chance of the tagged output being picked as a decoy\" is a completely incorrect question to begin with. It assumes that the exchange already knows, for certain, that those particular funds were later re-deposited onto the exchange by the dealer, in which case the entire argument is irrelevant.\n\nYou have to consider *all of the other outputs* *selected* as possible sources of the funds. So it technically could've come from that output, but it is equally likely that it came from any of 120 others. And also the fact that there are going to be several other transactions using the output as a decoy, plus several more using the outputs from *those* transactions, means that it quickly becomes impossible to determine where the funds actually went.

There are [plenty of examples](https://wizardofads.org/reverse-psychology-and-advertising-strategy/) of advertisements making use of this technique. A recent successful example is Patagonia using it in 2011; after this campaign they [quadrupled their sales estimates](https://bettermarketing.pub/dont-buy-this-jacket-patagonia-s-daring-campaign-2b37e145046b).\n\nFor people who don't know what Monero is and don't care to read the fine print, this is designed to act like a subconscious psychological reactance seed. For those who are hooked enough to read, it makes the reader question how some grassroots computer nerd movement could possibly weaken banks and states, two of the most powerful forces in our society.\n\nI've always liked it for this clever multi-pronged approach. All that said, there are probably better iterations of this that better fit with these times.

Reverse psychology is sometimes referred to as\u00a0psychological reactance, which is the aroused state that occurs when a freedom is threatened or eliminated. The higher stake or more freedoms that are threatened, the more arousal that can be expected. People prefer to be free to select what they like. so when that freedom is taken away, they are motivated to restore it. Psychological reactance can be better explained as the idea that an item will be wanted more if people are told they cannot have it, which can relate to reverse psychology on some levels. Another influence technique that relates to reverse psychology is strategic self-anticonformity. Strategic self-anticonformity is when a person advocates a position that is opposite of their true thought, while hiding the fact that they are using a persuasion tactic. A common example of such is marketing techniques or tricks such as \"do not click this link,\" or \"do not push this button.\" Strategic self-anticonformity and psychological reactance relate in their expected negativity or disagreeableness from their influence target.\n\n- Wikipedia \n\nI know Wikipedia cannot be trusted for most information, so below is a more educational article.\n\n50 year review of psychological reactance theory: Do not read this article\n\nhttps://scholar.dominican.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=psychology-faculty-scholarship\n\nI recommend looking into this to get a better idea of how the \"Don't buy Monero\" advertisement is supposed to work. Or don't look into it the choice is yours.",

It is still the same value proposition that bitcoin holds but it has been watered down as nothing more than marketing material for selling financial products around bitcoin.

You can *always* recover with that phrase. With the 12(?) word Ledger wallet, you still depend on Ledger and its hardware -- not the Monero blockchain directly.\n\nPersonally I don't use Ledger, it's just more hardware that can go wrong and is an increased attack surface. I keep a \"cold\"/paper wallet for savings, and for transactions I keep a wallet (ie, the wallet files) on a removable drive that I plug in only while actually transacting. IMO just as good physical security (arguably even better, since it's a LUKS encrypted partition) and trivially easy for me to back up.\n\n> Can my everyday MacBook Pro run the GUI or does the blockchain take enormous amounts of memory?\n\nI haven't run the GUI on a MacBook so can't confirm. But the on-disk blockchain is ~130 GB; with sharding, around a third of that. RAM requirements even for the GUI should not be a concern.\n\nYou can also use \"simple mode\" which uses a remote node and therefore does not download the whole blockchain. An adversarial remove node is theoretically possible; you may wish to use a Tor remote node to ensure you can't be denonymized (see https://monero.fail for public nodes)\n\n> the funds become anonymous again once they're out of the CEX?\n\nThe finds become anonymous as soon as they hit your private self-hosted wallet. As others have noted, the address you withdraw to from the CEX will be known to the CEX (else they could not send you the funds), but knowing that address does not give away how much you have, where you got it, or where you subsequently spend it. You might want to give the CEX a subaddress that you only use for that CEX, or if the CEX doesn't support withdraw to a subaddress, do a subsequent transfer to a second wallet whose address the CEX does not know.",

You can use [localmonero](https://localmonero.co/) as a p2p method, or there are a few CEXs that you can buy from (such as KuCoin which you mentioned). Just make sure that you trust the CEX and that it will work for what you're trying to do.\n\nSecond is to convert from another cryptocurrency. Litecoin & BitcoinCash are good options because they both have low fees, are widely accepted, and can be obtained much more easily from a CEX than Monero. From there, you can easily swap those for Monero. Check out [kycnot.me](https://kycnot.me) for a bunch of options.\n\n>Is there any advantage to using the GUI wallet on a Ledger instead of just keeping it on my desktop?\n\nYes, a hardware wallet is more secure. A software wallet can be plenty secure too, though, if you take the proper precautions and know what you're doing. But if it's going to be on your regular desktop, then a hardware wallet is a must-have.\n\n>Can my everyday MacBook Pro run the GUI or does the blockchain take enormous amounts of memory?\n\nWell the entire blockchain is more than 100 gb, but it's kept on the hard drive as opposed to memory, and you don't even need to download it to use Monero. When setting up the GUI, use \"Simple Mode\", which connects to other nodes instead of you having to download the blockchain yourself. A full node (with the blockchain downloaded) is generally preferable, but it's not the end of the world if you don't.\n\nLong story short, yes, any reasonably modern computer can run the GUI wallet.\n\n>If i buy Monero with USD on KuCoin and transfer to the GUI wallet, is the privacy aspect destroyed at the gate or do the funds become anonymous again once they're out of the CEX?\n\nThe exchange will only be aware of the transaction which they sent your Monero through. After that, they won't know anything.",

Free pdf available, encourage you to donate if/when you can. Little out of date (second edition in the works), but still a great read. Will give you a good understanding of the basics of Monero, but does go into more advanced subjects and maths if you are interested.\n\nAnother great resource is this subreddit, search, read, most any question you have has probably already been asked.\n\nYet another great resource is [getmonero.org](https://getmonero.org) the official monero website.\n\nWhat wallet you should use is subjective to a certain extent and depends on your use-case and threat model. For some, Monerujo or Cake is sufficient (especially in small amounts). For others, using the GUI or Feather might be better. **No matter what though, write down your seed and store it some place safe.**\n\nIn terms of acquiring Monero, you can either go with an exchange such as Kraken or check out other options such as Localmonero or a crypto atm.\n\nIf you really just want a tiny amount to play with, you can mine XMR on your computer or posts memes on [xmrmemes.com](https://xmrmemes.com).\n\nGood luck!",

As such, the core consensus protocol was altered to prevent the proliferation of asics.\n\n*Regular* hard forks have been established in Monero to prevent a standstill like Bitcoin has for years, only some cosmetic improvements like SegWit *hacked in somehow* with a lot of contortions which could have been prevented and implemented much cleaner by simply hard forking. Pretty hard to understand there can be persistent consensus on compromises which are being made in the community the months before a hard fork for many Bitcoin maximalists who literally went to war in the block size question resulting in three different chains without a real solution. This was by the way the moment I quit Bitcoin end of 2015 and found Monero with its awesome dynamic block size which is - like mining itself - driven by consensus among miners and prevents one superior entity to flood the network with insanely sized blocks (BSV). When I then discovered the privacy features, I fell in love since up to that day I *believed* in the Bitcoin narrative of a ledger having to be transparent to prevent fraud.\n\nCryptonight ASICs came up much later and pushed a bit to keep the 6-month frequency for hard forks up (with releasing changes in the mining algorithm only like two weeks upfront) until RandomX came up. Since then never touched again and still working out great! I wonder what Bitcoin would do when sha256 would be considered broken at some point? Never hard fork.\n\n>Presumably these decisions are made by a small group of insiders. Further, who decides which chain is the true monero? Because all chain splits are inherently political, we tend to observe that some alternate chains are acceptable projects while others are labeled scams.\n\nHow many people have been actively involved in the implementation of SegWit? Schnorr? Taproot? There are no public dev-meetings in Bitcoin (as of my knowledge), one can only participate in mailing lists or on GitHub where I noticed a very ignorant communication towards new people, not only from Greg Maxwell. All those changes don't split the chain, however a not updated node is off the network since it doesn't understand most of what's going on on the network. Neither Monero is splitting the network when hard forking, but it has the possibility to implement new features best possible instead of shitloads of contortions just to not split the chain.\n\n>But the authority to designate a project as legitimate or not can lead to centralization of control and influence and, in the worst case, outright coercion. Bitcoin avoids this altogether by simply refusing to accept the validity of alternate coins.\n\nConsensus by ignorance. Weren't it the same people complaining about ignorance towards Bitcoin being superior to Fiat? I don't see Monero as an altcoin, I see Bitcoin as an altcoin sometimes useful for Fiat onramp, offramp is a harder story due to its lack of fungibility.\n\nIn the long term such ignorance and Bitcoin's non-development towards privacy and scalability without again some weird contortions in form of Lightning Network which has so many technical pitfalls or scams like Blockstream's proprietary Liquid network which solves (at least a bit) both of Bitcoin's main issues privacy (with at least stealth addresses implemented) and scalability at the cost of decentralisation towards a permissioned, centralised scam controlled by banks, will eventually fail.",

I dont agree! it is indeed detrimental if and only if there is nothing beyond the joke or if there is a contradiction, inconsistency with the true value proposition.\n\nBut this thread is not even about word of mouth (although its another needed discussion on its own), its about how much Monero would benefit from borrowing reputation from some popular and respectable individuals in synergetic domains.",

For something like Bitcoin, which is digital *gold*/a store of value, then sure it makes sense to have a capped supply. But for *currency,* you don't want a fixed supply. More Monero is already lost than is being mined, so it's already slightly deflationary. A lot of people have gone into depth about why the tail emission is better than a fixed supply for currency, you can probably search \"tail emission\" in this sub and find plenty of results. I think localmonero also has an article on it, as well as sethforprivacy.\n\nBTC is what happens when you refuse to upgrade. Maxis go through absurd mental gymnastics to justify even the most simple shortcomings of Bitcoin, like the high fees, the bandaid non-solutions of the lightning network and segwit, the ugly soft forks, etc. And its only been a *decade*, I can't even want to imagine what it'll be like by the turn of the century. I suppose that since we're talking about a \"perfect\" currency then no such shortcomings would exist. But in anything resembling reality, having the ability to patch bugs, upgrade the network, etc are non-negotiable. An immutable protocol would be like swearing to only use MS-DOS for the rest of your life in the '80s and then being surprised that it's now outdated and generally unusable today in 2022.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd also add to the list that a node should be extremely easy to run. Maybe everyone could run a node on their phone in the background, sipping a fraction of a percent of its resources. The \"perfect\" currency is one which can run off of a smart toaster.

It works in theory but has bever happened in practice.  \n\nMonero uses a tail emission model, so... early miners were heavily incentived, incentives go down until they get to a very small amount and then those stay permanently... (I believe it's .8 xmr per block in perpetuity)... infinitely far in the future the the supply goes to infinite, but you'd never get there.  In reality the inflation rate continually trends towards but never reaches 0 (since you're adding a fixed small amount to an increasingly large existing pool).\n\nEdit: typo",
