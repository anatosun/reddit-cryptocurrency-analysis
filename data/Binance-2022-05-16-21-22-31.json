            "selftext": "If you encounter the error above on your Binance account while trying to deposit Fiat using either Bank Transfer(SEPA) or Bank Card(Visa/MC). I might have a solution for you.   \n\n\n(Contacted Binance support 7 times on this issues and everytime they said I should use P2P instead. Thank you, Useless Binance Support!)  \n\n\nI should begin that in order to use Fiat on your Binance account you have to be verified, which I did 2 years ago, as you can see in the screenshot below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8abrjg0ofn61.png?width=1064&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8629e64f8025b9b6bd47544d6c9640fb0834dcd\n\nIf you go to Buy Crypto -> Bank Deposit ->  Bank Transfer(SEPA), for some of you this sceren might appear:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qd7q9ahgofn61.png?width=1702&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a6449790bf51ca6d7ff879ffa32f00271133771\n\nThe same thing appears for Bank Card(Visa/MC):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pppznminofn61.png?width=1700&format=png&auto=webp&s=f15a670984c009812cfefcc1e776c393b9b31cc1\n\nOk, so as you can see the My Privilege above are not really applying to me, right Useless Binance Support?  \n\n\nNext steps are for people who know what Chrome Developer Tools are. You have to Right Click -> Inspect on the payment details rectangle. and delete the 'div' element as in the screenshot below:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nwjvgbumpfn61.png?width=1718&format=png&auto=webp&s=26b96aa32489e1899ecc25f0e925f4cce6669c8b\n\n Once you delete it you should have something like this (looks like we are getting somewhere right?): \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2mvoneqpfn61.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff02ff86c71b8709e7bd1955b9b54b42d676b6e9\n\nAs you will probably realize you can't type in the Enter Amount input, so what you'll have to do is Inspect on the input element, remove the 'disabled' attribute, insert the amount and hit Continue.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t824m43bqfn61.png?width=1719&format=png&auto=webp&s=80ef739a1b43867c899d6f3722b8cce4f7ae684e\n\n[I redacted all the details above this is why you have Os and 0s.](https://preview.redd.it/9sszlo02sfn61.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=b42345e1d605f38f12eb216ed9a07822880d05f3)\n\nI think that this is a bug on Binance part that they are too incompetent to fix it. The Support team is alos incompetent to at least flag it to the dev team. I did a small transfer to test it and it worked.   \n\n\nDiscalimer: Please be carefull with what I presented above as you might lose your money, try to transfer the minimum amount of money at first in order to verify this actually works. For me it did.  \n\n\nHave a great day!",
