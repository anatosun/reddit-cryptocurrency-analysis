This means that **such a change would require unanimous support which would be an impossible task** especially since the 21 limit is considered part of Bitcoins ethos and brand.\n\nThe most that would happen if some group did this is create an altcoin that people ignored and dumped their split coins on which would drive the price of that altcoin into the ground. The Game theory would also support the scarcer and original coin being desired while the altcoin being dumped and exchanged for real Bitcoins.",
