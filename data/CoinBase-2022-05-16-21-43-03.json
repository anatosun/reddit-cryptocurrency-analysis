I manage to find emails from coinbase at 8:07am stating the first bit of my portfolio was sold and converted to cash and wired off. I signed into coinbase and found a Chime and Sable bank account that were randomly added to my account. \n\nI had google authenticator enabled, I received no 2 fa text, no new device sign in email, no anything. Somehow everything was breached. \n\nThe account sign-in log doesn't even show anyone was on my account at the time of the transfers. \n\nI contacted support and asked them to stop/reverse these transfers and they say they can't. I even contacted Chime and Sable explained stolen funds are on the way to the account numbers. No luck.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas or has been in this situation? I really hate to believe that coinbase is going to just sit back and make me watch my $20,000 be sent off into the sunset on a pending wire transfer to some thief when their security failed in every way. \n\nEspecially when they had the account information and time on their side.\n\nCASE#  11845720",

You don't receive text if you're using Google authenticator.  \n\nEither you use an authenticator app or SMS text for 2FA, not both on the same account.  This leads me to believe you weren't using either which therefore explains perfectly how and why this happened.  \n\nSorry for your loss but this space is a place for us to learn from each others successes and failures and that can only take place with honesty.

That doesn't seem like something a person wanting to learn would do. \n\nBut if this is true then it would have been on text 2fa. I had to get a new phone about a month ago. That phone had my authenticator on it and I had to go through the identity verification process to get signed back in once I got a new phone as I could not access the authenticator on my other phone because it was broken. \n\nThe reason I said it had both, is because upon signing into my account and checking the security tab, it listed both the authenticator and text 2fa as enabled and \"very secure. \"",
