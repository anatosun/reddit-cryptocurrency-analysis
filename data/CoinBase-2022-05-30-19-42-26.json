Support recommended I make a new account and transfer my funds over, so I said okay and they said they sent my ticket to the proper support team for transfer.\n\n2 weeks go by and I move my funds to Coinbase Pro, then move them back on 5/24. on 5/25 at 6PM $1,180 randomly disappears from my account, then on 5/25 at 7:55PM $1,454 disappears from my account. Then the remaining dollars of my mixed assets disappear 8:30PM (With no transaction or withdraw history whatsoever) I receive $0.01USD and $0.54SOL from Coinbase on my new account... none of my other assets were sent.\n\nIt is now 5 days later and I have spoke to multiple support specialists via phone, text support, and e-mail, as well as numerous even hung-up on me while in silence. I am getting no answers or resolution. One support specialist told me that my funds were being transferred to my new account, although it was very obvious that the specialist had no clue what he was talking about because he couldn't even tell me the amount being transferred when I asked, then hung up on me when I requested to speak with a supervisor. I am in shambles and all I seek are my funds back, I am having no help from support, I am experiencing the run-a-round... I am so stressed the past 5 days this is unbelievable.",

I only used them a long time ago when I couldn\u2019t buy certain things on Coinbase.\n\nLike I said, someone will eventually get to the bottom of your issue. It\u2019s just getting to the right person that can be difficult. \n\nEven if you did send your coins to a scammer address, they will let you know that the coins were sent to an unknown external address and it\u2019s irreversible. It happened to me once on the good old fake Elon Musk twitter comment directly under his tweet. Just accepted it and moved on or I\u2019d be bitter forever.\n\nWasn\u2019t Coinbase\u2019s fault, it was mine. As many horror stories as there are here, Coinbase has been where I\u2019ve felt safest aside from my own hardware wallet. For example, Binance won\u2019t even verify me because they still think I live in a state I moved from 6 years ago.\n\nHopefully it is just an error on their end though, that would be ideal.

I had crypto stolen out of my account with out any 2 step verification 40+ times in a row until they wiped out my whole crypto account and bank account after they got my crypto they started buying crypto with my bank account attached until I noticed. Went on for 7 hours with no notifications or anything. The only money I got back was the money out of my bank account, and coin base is trying to say I owe them that money since my bank reversed the charges. Lost all crypto though. Sorry to be a downer man lol hope you have a better experience with customer service.",
