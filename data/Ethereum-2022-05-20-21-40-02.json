            "selftext": "After major fomo hearing about how artists are turning to NFT's and making a killing, I decided I would do a little research and try my own creation just to see what the process is like. I felt like Rarible would be a good first place to start and hopefully stand out as a jewel among some of the crap. I already had some ethereum and had to transfer it to a wallet. That's the first fee. Whenever you transfer the stuff, it costs money. I connected my wallet, which practically serves as your profile and place where you keep collectibles as well as crypto. I picked a scan of a drawing that I liked and began the upload process. It's all pretty easy, but they don't really talk about how expensive it is to post things. This scales based on the  workload of the network. And now, it's crazy high. I spent about $60 to post after all the fees, and that's when it was pretty low. I was open to any transaction, I just wanted someone to have my art and see how it works, so I left the bid open. After I posted it to the gram, my friend placed a $1 bid! Cool! I'll take anything for the first time trying! Excited, I accepted and found that there was a $100 miner fee... again... to complete the bid. Now, I'm no business major, but none of this makes any sense. So I'm boiling this experience down to the following feelings/possibilities: right now it's too expensive to add your work because a lot of people are using the network to process things. Unless you have work that will sell enough to cover miner fees, it isn't worth it. There may be better websites to post on, but some of them require an application process. Could some sites be playing off the recent publicity and just trying to make a dime off the little guy through fees? How are so many things selling for so low? Fees, fees, and more fees. I once told myself I'd never pay to play again but I feel like I paid and got played... On purpose. Overall, I was happy to take a risk and learn some valuable lessons. Actually, I still haven't really learned much. But I did spend almost $200 to let my friend have a digital version of my art. Can we talk about how nice I am?",

I want artists to be successful, but I also want deeper, meaningful work that inspires. We're jumping on board to test the waters especially after seeing it become so lucrative to a select few. Royalties, authenticity, are all very appealing. But does it make people create the best work? Do NFT's bring life and energy to the world? Is it sustainable? What is the energy impact of a single transaction? Does anyone else get slight ponzi scheme/ gamification vibes? Regardless, if you make your success with it, I'm rooting for you.

Basically, ethereum transactions are so expensive because every computer on the blockchain has to process the transaction. That\u2019s layer 1. Layer 2 is usually a more centralized computer processing the transaction and then using fancy math and algorithms it\u2019s guaranteed to be legit and pushed on chain onto Layer 1. Like a bunch of transactions are batched together and processed together and then pushed to ethereums layer 1. This cuts down on costs because all the computers on layer 1 just have to verify one transaction which is the one batch and not the hundreds of different transactions in that batch. Sorry that\u2019s the best I can do explaining if you need to understand more then I\u2019d suggest google but you do need a bit of a basic understanding on how blockchain works.",

All trades made since then will be roled back to when BTC and BCH forked. Counterparty is really dead because high fees killed it. \n\nNon Fungible Tokens are possible on the Simple Ledger Protocol which is  indeed extremely simply but does not scale at all.\n\nStill, right now there is a lot of room for growth on the BCH chain. \n\nAs an Ethereum user I hope the fees problem will soon be solved. As a musician and artist I can't wait for them to solve it. So I am going to create my own market by getting the bitcoin cash counter party fork to work. And then I will create my own NFT assest and tell everybody that used to trade on counterparty that they can trade again if they are okay with  a roll back to august 2018.\n\nSince most of their assets are untradable because high fees killed their markets they will probably be really happy that I am rebooting their markets. \n\n\nIf anybody wants to try out SLP the easiest way is through https://memo.cash\n\nFor 1 cents you can create 10 NTF tokens.\n\nAfter rebooting counterparty and getting trades going, once people are making money I will simply tell them that everything is going to migrate from counterparty to SLP.\n\nSince I will be paying for running the counterparty servers they will have no choise to follow if they still want to trade.\n\nThen counterparty is official dead and the NFT scene on SLP is kickstarted by all the[ rare pepe traders](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/1/23/rare-pepe-wallet-the-birth-of-cryptoart) and many more.

Im an art major and frankly I avoided taking digital art courses for a while because its not like that shit is hard. The real skill comes in learning to master physical mediums. Digital art is nothing more than an approximate reproduction of the experience which is far less satisfying imo. \n\nIm going into a more technical field now which requires me to do digital art... but again, its just about learning the program. Again... not hard especially for anyone my generation and younger who have spent their whole lives in front of a computer and know how to pick techy things up right quick. \n\nAnd if youre doing real art and then photographing it... its a reproduction. If you bought that shit to hang on your wall, you will have to go to a special printer place to get it done to make it look like a real painting. Theres also other steps to it that typically artists do to give it a little extra. And its still not the original. Youre buying less no matter what. \n\nIdk guys, I love technology but I hate the obsession with trying to make everything real into virtual. We are not \u201ctranscending\u201d by making a fake approximation of the real... we are volunteering to never see the truth and beauty in the universe. I mean the way people talk sometimes Its like they WANT the matrix to be real. Its not a better world, not a better life because we wont be in control. \n\nIm not religious or superstitious but there is something to this whole idea of \u201cstraying from gods light\u201d. There are things in this life that are a gift given by no man... you can say it was a gift from god, from nature... from something beyond our power... and to let that be stolen from us is seriously going to hurt us.",

But because of that, the standard goes up as does competition, making it much harder.  \n\n\nWith traditional painting, people are much more accepting of mistakes, but with digital art, there are digital artists who spent a decade on this craft to become perfect but they're a dime in a dozen.   \n\n\nIf it's so easy, then how can there be so many digital artists struggling to do it? I used to think it would be super easy but was surprised to find it taking me around two years to gain my normal traditional art skill back.   \n\n\nBut hey, since it's so easy, you should buy one! You'd absolutely would make a killing and could even use it to fund your normal paintings /s",

I do both, and I do notice something is sort of lost in digital art, even with all the fancy brushes. But it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not valuable, it\u2019s just different. So the NFT thing does indeed make a lot of sense, but it seems a little hard to get into right now. \n\nArt is just philosophy, that\u2019s why people can plaster a banana on a wall and it\u2019s art, and that too is definitely easier than a whole painting. Art doesn\u2019t even have to be attractive or pleasant. \nAlso it means that people don\u2019t approach it from a craftsmanship POV anymore.",
