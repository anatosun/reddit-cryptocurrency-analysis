I fell staking is a \"scam\" in its very nature and is almost as legacy bonds with government. And we are seeing how it is turning out for us. So much misery around all of us. \n\nThe way I see you can get more SATS is:\nBy selling your expertise or service that you are good at. \n\nThat's how you  will store your value of your time and effort at that very moment, for future utility. \n\nYou want more btc, scale up your personal skills, learn new things and sell them for more btc. \n\nAccording to me this should be mindset. \n\nI draw these conclusions from what I have seen in gold:\n\nYou want more gold, sell your skills for gold. It was being done for centuries. \n\nNo one paid out gold for storing your gold as far as I know.",
