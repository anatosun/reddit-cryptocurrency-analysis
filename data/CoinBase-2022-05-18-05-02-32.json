I just received and activated my Coinbase card, however, I don't have any button or field in the App where I can view my card or choose what coin to receive the cashback in. \n\nI've looked at 2 month old videos in YouTube and the App has 6-7 buttons to click around from, but mine has only 4 and no card tab or anything of that sort.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips or a video tutorial in case I'm missing something?",

It takes you to the card where you can add funds, choose your cashback and tap the card itself to view the card details.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnless you JUST signed up. If you did, you may not have been issued card details yet.",
