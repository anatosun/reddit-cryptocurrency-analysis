He suggested that a stablecoin project\u2019s market activity \u201cdrops to near zero,\u201d users should be able to extract the fair value of their liquidity from the asset. He also suggested that the project should implement a negative interest rate when it tracks a \u201cbasket of assets\u201d that grows at 20%.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

                    "response": "Can someone explain to me how a stablecoin like RAI would handle the following situation?\n\nLet's say there is much higher demand for owning RAI than for borrowing RAI, which is to say people want to buy RAI instead of borrowing RAI against ETH collateral. In this case the price of RAI would go up. If I understand correctly, the protocol would then work against that by making interest rates negative and therefore incentivizing the borrowing of RAI. People would then likely borrow RAI, do nothing with it and collect the negative interest rates, possibly sell them and therefore stabilize the price.\n\nAs long as rates are positive all RAI in existence are borrowed into existence. The protocol can then decrease the supply by increasing the rates and incentivizing people to return their borrowed RAI. But if rates go negative for long enough, RAI are created that are not borrowed.\n\nIf we assume that people would just hold the borrowed RAI in case of negative interest rates, then the rates have to be significantly negative for a significant amount of time in order to create enough coins that are actually sold to balance the price. This means that with enough demand for RAI, over time the majority of the circulating supply would not be borrowed RAI anymore.\n\nWhat happens if now the demand for RAI goes down and interest rates turn positive? The people that held borrowed RAI only to generate more RAI return their RAI to the protocol but now all the additional RAI that was created through negative interest rates is still circulating. It might even be that all borrowed RAI is returned to the protocol but there is still a lot of remaining RAI in circulation and the protocol has no mechanism anymore to make these coins more valuable.\n\nI guess in this scenario RAI would just lose its peg and become unusable as a stablecoin. Any thoughts on this?",

                            "response": "I think this question all lies on the surplus treasury mechanism. Normally there is a constant positive interest rate paying into the surplus treasury. During times like you're describing, the treasury is essentially losing money in order to pay out the negative interest. During stable operation the natural state is the surplus treasury is gaining money, and it also gains even more money during increased interest periods.\n\nI don't obviously have exact math, but I believe this would allow it to maintain stability, assuming the surplus treasury can outlast negative interest periods. (Which it really should be able to.)",

Value is what people are ready to pay in any other assets to buy this product. People want an asset that keeps its value so that they can save the value they produced for others for later. And really, that role is not provided by fiat, which has proven to be too inflationary to allow people to keep value for what they've offered to others. \n\nIf you really want to, get robbed all you want, but you're not the one who will prevent others from accessing assets that keep their financial security safe. \n\n>Stablecoins BY DEFINITION are stable in PRICE\n\nHum, no, clearly not. That wouldn't be possible anyway to be stable in price against everything, because every other asset has its own prices fluctuating against any other asset. Being pegged to a fiat only means you're completely sure your stablecoin won't be very stable, as you're completely sure it will lose value over time. \n\nCommodities aren't denominated in fiat either, that doesn't make any sense: commodities have values that you can buy with several other assets, being locally sold preferentially in a fiat or another doesn't change anything to its value. Do you think electricity can only be bought in USD? Or even in fiat? There even already are crypto about decentralized electricity markets, for instance, right into Brooklyn. And it's not pegged to USD at all. \n\n>In this last case, you don't need a stablecoin for anything at all. Just buy the underlying crypto, because 1 BTC or 1 ETH will always be 1 BTC or 1 ETH.\n\nIt's not about being pegged to BTC or ETH. Read again, really.",

                    "response": "> If, in the extreme case, all demand for holding RAI disappears simultaneously except for one holder, the redemption rate would skyrocket until eventually every lender's safe gets liquidated. The single remaining holder would be able to buy the safe in the liquidation auction, use their RAI to immediately clear its debt, and withdraw the ETH. This gives them the opportunity to get a fair price for their RAI, paid for out of the ETH in the safe.\n\n> Another extreme case worth examining is where RAI becomes the primary appliation on Ethereum. In this case, a reduction in expected future demand for RAI would crater the price of ETH. In the extreme case, a cascade of liquidations is possible, leading to a messy collapse of the system. But RAI is far more robust against this possibility than a Terra-style system.\n\n**TLDR**: Step 1. Assume ETH is stable. Step 2. Voil\u00e0! \n\nLol such a genius this guy",
