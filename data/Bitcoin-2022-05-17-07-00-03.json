Think medical devices, airplanes, bitcoin, etc. Software wallets are perpetually online and you're relying on a 3rd party server. This means they're easier to hack. No hacker needs access to physical hardware in the physical world, so they can sit on their couch 5000 miles away brute forcing and running various automated tools probing for weaknesses and any bits of information that they can pool. Software wallets are fine for small amounts and spending. You don't even need to store keys securely for these. They're disposable checking accounts. Use them a few times then generate a new one. Hard wallets however, are where your savings go.",
