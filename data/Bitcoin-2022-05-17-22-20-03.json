Perpetual mining is bad because one of Bitcoin's biggest advantages over fiat currency is that it cannot be infinitely inflated. \n\nBut if you're asking about subdividing more than the current limit of 100k Satoshis/BTC, I think of it like this. Imagine some glorious future where 1BTC = $100,000,000 USD. At that point one Satoshi would be worth a dollar (assuming I'm doing my math right). So you might argue that people could no longer buy anything for less than a dollar. Then I would counter, that by that time, a dollar would be so debased, that you couldn't buy anything for $1USD anyway. Just like you can't buy anything (that I'm aware of) for a penny today.",
