I prefer Airtm, but it's USD based and the best way to get in & out is using **tether**. The only major issue with Airtm is it's not necessarily legal to trade gift cards, whereas Purse is fully legal. Airtm is way way faster (just use Binance P2P to sell tether for AirUSD). BCH is just a **S**tore-**O**f-**V**alue from my point of view, because the tether traders are too damn good.",
