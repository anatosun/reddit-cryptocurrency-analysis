So if you want to make sure that you are in control over your funds and don't lose them if e. g. the exchange gets hacked, you need to store the keys yourself, preferably on a hardware wallet.",

It may not appear that there's that much BTC in LN channels currently, but those are all public routing nodes you can see, not private nodes which make up the vast majority and are hidden. That suckage should grow exponentially over the next few years.\n* It's bitcoin businesses growing\n* It's tax laws\n* It's more people opting to get paid in bitcoin\n* Most importantly however, it's actually that people are **SPENDING** more bitcoin than ever. More online businesses and brick and mortar shops are accepting bitcoin. People are gifting it. Donating it. Lots of rewards in bitcoin. Etcetera. All major exchanges have a mobile app that allows spending/sending, they have debit cards tied to their coinage, some even have bill pay.\n\nWe're moving from slowly, to suddenly.",

If large volumes of BTC move off exchange, it signals intent to hold long-term based on past data. We use things like the number of wallets that have not moved their coin in X time to determine market sentiment. If lots of people are moving BTC off exchange, and the number of individual wallets is growing, it signals A) people taking self-custody and B) retail market participation.  Things like 1 year illiquid vs liquid supply helps you determine the velocity of an asset. More HODLERS = less liquid supply. Less HODLERS = more liquid supply = higher velocity and more liquidity for large players entering and exiting the market.   \n\n\nWe've seen the BTC liquid supply on-exchange dwindle to somewhere between 1-2 million BTC by most estimates. When that exchange-side liquid supply drops below 1 million, I'm moving everything out of exchanges and my BlockFi interest account onto cold storage. You leave yours on exchange and let me know how it works out for you when exchange side liquid supply dries up and the market moves by an order of magnitude.",

If they somehow lose the money they lent, you obviously are not getting that money back unless they have reserves to cover that loss (which as far as I know they have). If Celsius goes under, it'd be because the money they lent has not been paid back therefore they don't have \"your\" money. If you don't like that, don't give your money to a lending platform lmao and go do something else with your money.",
