So if you want to make sure that you are in control over your funds and don't lose them if e. g. the exchange gets hacked, you need to store the keys yourself, preferably on a hardware wallet.",

It may not appear that there's that much BTC in LN channels currently, but those are all public routing nodes you can see, not private nodes which make up the vast majority and are hidden. That suckage should grow exponentially over the next few years.\n* It's bitcoin businesses growing\n* It's tax laws\n* It's more people opting to get paid in bitcoin\n* Most importantly however, it's actually that people are **SPENDING** more bitcoin than ever. More online businesses and brick and mortar shops are accepting bitcoin. People are gifting it. Donating it. Lots of rewards in bitcoin. Etcetera. All major exchanges have a mobile app that allows spending/sending, they have debit cards tied to their coinage, some even have bill pay.\n\nWe're moving from slowly, to suddenly.",

If large volumes of BTC move off exchange, it signals intent to hold long-term based on past data. We use things like the number of wallets that have not moved their coin in X time to determine market sentiment. If lots of people are moving BTC off exchange, and the number of individual wallets is growing, it signals A) people taking self-custody and B) retail market participation.  Things like 1 year illiquid vs liquid supply helps you determine the velocity of an asset. More HODLERS = less liquid supply. Less HODLERS = more liquid supply = higher velocity and more liquidity for large players entering and exiting the market.   \n\n\nWe've seen the BTC liquid supply on-exchange dwindle to somewhere between 1-2 million BTC by most estimates. When that exchange-side liquid supply drops below 1 million, I'm moving everything out of exchanges and my BlockFi interest account onto cold storage. You leave yours on exchange and let me know how it works out for you when exchange side liquid supply dries up and the market moves by an order of magnitude.",

Bitcoin is decentralized and regulating it would be completely against what it is (and it would cease being what it is).  Exchanges are centralized companies, stablecoins (some) claim to be backed by other assets.  By its nature, Bitcoin is not directly tied to any asset nor is there is any authority that could make such a claim.\n\nMost seem against regulation under the premise that the point of crypto is to get away from government/bank control. I get that, but it seems unavoidable up to this point that centralized points form and these points need to be regulated. exchanges need to have some oversight and stablecoins that claim to have backed assets need to be forced to be transparent and should be audited.\n\ndo I want regulation of Bitcoin? fuck no.\n\ndo I want regulation of stable coins? fuck yes.\n\nIf you think this isn't necessary then moving forward we need to remove the need for exchanges and stable coins tied to other assets.  \n\nIf you have that figured out, I'm all ears.",

If they somehow lose the money they lent, you obviously are not getting that money back unless they have reserves to cover that loss (which as far as I know they have). If Celsius goes under, it'd be because the money they lent has not been paid back therefore they don't have \"your\" money. If you don't like that, don't give your money to a lending platform lmao and go do something else with your money.",

So in theory, it should be absolutely impossible for Celsius to go under because a borrower goes bankrupt. Unless of course, they are doing other shady shit. Which I guarantee they are as I read their financial filings and to me, it seems their business model is total ass if not for their shit CEL token.\n\nAlso, Celsius isn't even insured against a hack.\n\nBunch of c#nts",

Of course, deployed assets cannot be insured, you'd be dumb to think that's even a possibility.\n\nDo you have any other lies to spread?",
