So if you want to make sure that you are in control over your funds and don't lose them if e. g. the exchange gets hacked, you need to store the keys yourself, preferably on a hardware wallet.",

It may not appear that there's that much BTC in LN channels currently, but those are all public routing nodes you can see, not private nodes which make up the vast majority and are hidden. That suckage should grow exponentially over the next few years.\n* It's bitcoin businesses growing\n* It's tax laws\n* It's more people opting to get paid in bitcoin\n* Most importantly however, it's actually that people are **SPENDING** more bitcoin than ever. More online businesses and brick and mortar shops are accepting bitcoin. People are gifting it. Donating it. Lots of rewards in bitcoin. Etcetera. All major exchanges have a mobile app that allows spending/sending, they have debit cards tied to their coinage, some even have bill pay.\n\nWe're moving from slowly, to suddenly.",

If large volumes of BTC move off exchange, it signals intent to hold long-term based on past data. We use things like the number of wallets that have not moved their coin in X time to determine market sentiment. If lots of people are moving BTC off exchange, and the number of individual wallets is growing, it signals A) people taking self-custody and B) retail market participation.  Things like 1 year illiquid vs liquid supply helps you determine the velocity of an asset. More HODLERS = less liquid supply. Less HODLERS = more liquid supply = higher velocity and more liquidity for large players entering and exiting the market.   \n\n\nWe've seen the BTC liquid supply on-exchange dwindle to somewhere between 1-2 million BTC by most estimates. When that exchange-side liquid supply drops below 1 million, I'm moving everything out of exchanges and my BlockFi interest account onto cold storage. You leave yours on exchange and let me know how it works out for you when exchange side liquid supply dries up and the market moves by an order of magnitude.",

But I think I'm diverting from the point of this post.  \n\nThis isn't the antiwork sub (and I don't approve of antiwork) - this is the bitcoin sub, so to sum up in responding to your comment, this is just me stating that human **and** technological work is important, but by necessity, the sort of work that we will find ourselves doing or joyful doing in the open market will always be evolving and changing.  That is, the work *you* find valuable is important, the work performed *by specialized machines* (for example, bitcoin miners) is important, and *some sort of hybrid* is important where people gradually become owners and beneficiaries of work done by robots / automatons / automations - that's important too ( if you want to get more into ideas about that, see r/Vyrdism, and as one specific example, see:  [https://np.reddit.com/r/Vyrdism/comments/5d82w1/new\\_here\\_how\\_can\\_i\\_join\\_a\\_technocoop/](https://np.reddit.com/r/Vyrdism/comments/5d82w1/new_here_how_can_i_join_a_technocoop/) )\n\nBut mostly, my post was meant to emphasize that people shouldn't be quick to get into panic selling and trying to get into this to make a quick buck, and before they dump a valuable and scarce asset, they should look back on the past.",

[Dollar cost average into bitcoin](https://dcabtc.com/).  The exchanges that allow you the most direct conversions, that's great if you can do it, but many of those exchanges (most if not all) don't operate / aren't licensed from jurisdictions that give you any ownership rights at all over your assets.  So instead, use Kraken, which is licensed in Wyoming, which does give you ownership rights over your assets even when the assets are in fully managed custody of the exchange.\n\nIf you are running a business you can use a service like Coinpayments if you are a businessperson: [https://www.coinpayments.net/help-fees](https://www.coinpayments.net/help-fees) Simple, you can accept payment in any cryptocurrency, but do any number of conversions and have your settings directed to direct the conversion result in bitcoin payment to your hardware wallet address.",

As for bankruptcy, crypto exchanges have very few hard assets, no tangible goods, buildings, machinery, raw materials or anything, to sell off to pay creditors, so by definition literally everyone loses out.\n\nProbably best only using exchanges to exchange and only ever holding small amounts on there that you wouldn't mind losing.",

If they somehow lose the money they lent, you obviously are not getting that money back unless they have reserves to cover that loss (which as far as I know they have). If Celsius goes under, it'd be because the money they lent has not been paid back therefore they don't have \"your\" money. If you don't like that, don't give your money to a lending platform lmao and go do something else with your money.",

So in theory, it should be absolutely impossible for Celsius to go under because a borrower goes bankrupt. Unless of course, they are doing other shady shit.
