Some random crypto bro saw me in a bitcoin cash T and was all like, yo, bro, you like bitcoin so check out all these coinz for mad gainz. I think Luna was one of them. I mean, eventually reality catches up with these people, but the market could take a *looong* time to sort itself out. I didn't really believe this in 2017 and thought bitcoin cash had a good chance at overtaking BTC, so I traded away a bunch of BTC for BCH (in retrospect not my smartest decision). But hey, you only have limited information to work with and have to make the best use of it.",
