It sounded like they didn\u2019t have enough customer service people to handle all of the issues. I\u2019m not sure if they went though technical issues on their end, or if the VPN I was using was causing them to doubt my identity. I never got answers about the why. But they emailed and said it would take x number of weeks to resolve it, then they emailed again and said they needed 6 more weeks. I was mad, but decided to be patient, and it all got sorted out. I was freaking because I wasn\u2019t sure my account would still be there, etc.\n\nI can tell you one thing I have learned. I no longer use their app on my phone. I only log in from my laptop.",
