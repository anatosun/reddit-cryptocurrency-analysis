                    "response": "There is no good reason to use Bitcoin-backed notes.  We can use Bitcoin itself.  \n\nYou show bank notes which claim to be backed by silver.  The idea was you could take them to a branch of the issuing bank and exchange them for actual silver.  So, *what backs the silver*?  Why not just use silver coins/bars?  \n\nThe silver needs no backing, it has properties of sound money: durable, divisible, fungible, recognizable, portable, scarce.  Bitcoin also has all the properties of sound money.  Bitcoin is very scarce.  \n\nWhy did people use silver-backed bank notes instead of actual silver?  Using silver coins works great for things like a cup of coffee, a roast beef sandwich, cab fare, a new suit, leather shoes, and so forth.  For large values such automobiles, real estate, the amount of silver required becomes impractical.  Large amounts of silver (or gold) are expensive to store securely and very expensive to transport securely.  Rather than buy an expensive home safe, most people found it convenient to store their precious metals in a bank, where they already had strong security and employed armored trucks to move \"money\".  People trusted that they could always get some actual silver from the bank, if necessary.\n\nBitcoin does not have the security expenses of silver/gold.  Bitcoin can be stored securely for very little cost.  In fact, it is possible to store billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in your mind and/or hidden on small slips of papper.  Transporting Bitcoin only costs a \"mining fee\" - no matter how much Bitcoin is sent, no matter how far.  \n\nThus, there is no motivation to trust a 3rd party's bank notes claiming to be backed by Bitcoin because holding your own private keys is not a problem and neither is selling/transporting it.  \n\nRemember, the bankers always end up issuing more notes than they have silver/gold/Bitcoin to back.  They should not be trusted.",
