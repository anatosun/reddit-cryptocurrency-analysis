My first thought was minting directly on Opensea contract, but usually NFTs minted in that way aren't worth overtime.\n\nDoes anyone know what's the best way to mint a NFT art? Should it be minting a new contract just for that?\n\nI also thought about Tezos, but I don't know much about their environment.",

So the art is on chain.\n\nI\u2019d recommend looking at objkt.com as you can mint through there as well as create your own collection.\n\nYou pay 1 Tez to create a collection of your own that your pieces can be minted to. It\u2019s an easy process and I\u2019d do that for where you\u2019re at.",
