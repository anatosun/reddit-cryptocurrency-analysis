There is a difference between ownership and everything functioning on Bitcoin. At what point does the scale tip so that it doesn't make any sense to be on anything other than a Bitcoin standard?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny insights would be grately appreciated.",

Most of the world's richest people/corps/institutions are invested in and reliant on the dollar system. They can literally print the money for anything they need. They aren't going to give that up for a fair system that would make them play by the same rules as everyone else. Not voluntarily anyway.\n\nSo for the Bitcoin Standard to become a reality, there will have to be a major crisis that shakes up the current system so badly that people are desperate enough to try something else. Could be war, could be something even worse.",
