The Fiat Standard goes into this in great detail with cited sources abound. Solar and wind would fail if the government couldn't print money to subsidize their existence. Even through taxation alone, wind/solar are completely unsustainable energy sources. \"Renewables\" are a net negative for society and contribute to inflation driving up the cost of energy for everyone over time. With technological invocation, energy costs reduce over time by default without government intervention. Unfortunately, we see government intervention contributing to forcing energy providers to increase consumer costs instead.\n\nEdit: also there's a difference from your getting off the grid and powering your own life on wind or solar energy. But when still a part of the grid, tax benefits and inflation are the only thing keeping your costs down while punishing the entire grid connected to you. So obviously I'm not sure which lane that puts you in \ud83d\ude0e if you're off-grid congrats! That's a great example of positivity for solar. But it's the exception to the rule.",

The one thing that always happened the brief period I used bitcoin early on was that when I sent bitcoin to an address it was always there and it always stayed there indefinitely until I accessed it again. 100% of the time. At the time I didn't really think much about it, it just worked and worked well for what I needed it for, but thinking back on it now it was fucking remarkable how reliable it was and still is.",

For coins that have staking you can put them in personal wallet and stake them on liquidity pools (but you still hold the private key on that crypto and can remove them from liquidity pool whenever you want).  A cold wallet though implies you don't connect it online at all so if you go that route you cannot stake.\n\nFor coins that don't have staking (like bitcoin) moving to a personal or cold wallet you miss out on interest earned for loaning it out.  Given how low a yield the exchanges pay for loaning it out I think it's a good move to get it off exchange anyways and into a wallet where you hold the private key.",

When you leave the coin at the exchange, they actually hold the key to your coins. They actually own it. In return they give you an \u201caccount balance\u201d which is just a number from their database, just a promise.\n\nLike a bank holding your deposit, they could lend your coin to the short positions, they could pledge it to someone for liquidity, they could be selling it to another customer. When things go bad all you have is a promise from the exchange. You can call the customer service to ask for your coin but who knows what will happen. \nNot your keys, not your coins. If you actually hold the 24 word seed phrase to the bitcoin then you actually own it, you\u2019re golden.",
