I got the confirmation it was sent from the sending institution and I sleep easy.   \n\n\nThe main reason is because I learned how to send and receive bitcoin 10 years ago so it's not a mystery to me whether it will be there. The one thing that always happened the brief period I used bitcoin early on was that when I sent bitcoin to an address it was always there and it always stayed there indefinitely until I accessed it again. 100% of the time. At the time I didn't really think much about it, it just worked and worked well for what I needed it for, but thinking back on it now it was fucking remarkable how reliable it was and still is.",

The Fiat Standard goes into this in great detail with cited sources abound. Solar and wind would fail if the government couldn't print money to subsidize their existence. Even through taxation alone, wind/solar are completely unsustainable energy sources. \"Renewables\" are a net negative for society and contribute to inflation driving up the cost of energy for everyone over time. With technological invocation, energy costs reduce over time by default without government intervention. Unfortunately, we see government intervention contributing to forcing energy providers to increase consumer costs instead.\n\nEdit: also there's a difference from your getting off the grid and powering your own life on wind or solar energy. But when still a part of the grid, tax benefits and inflation are the only thing keeping your costs down while punishing the entire grid connected to you. So obviously I'm not sure which lane that puts you in \ud83d\ude0e if you're off-grid congrats! That's a great example of positivity for solar. But it's the exception to the rule.",
