The true madness is about to begin. The fiat currency is becoming rapidly more and more toxic. Hyperinflation insures and the path to new era of sound money hopefully follows.

                    "response": "I think the fiat currencies are more \"backed\" by the debt of the Country/Government itself, which, the US for example, has used (probably the majority of) to the build up and buy the largest military in the world, now we can say that the country is backed by its military and the debt allowed it to be possible at scale. This is quite the nasty deal though over the decades and centuries, because it means larger scale wars and a lot of death around the world over countries competing with armies that no one would be able to afford without all that debt. The US very may well have not become \"the greatest country in the world\" if it did not pull off such huge military wins with both World War 1 and World War 2 (the looting that the WW1 victors did to Germany is also kind of what led to Adolf Hitler taking power) all while taking relatively little damage to its own military and homeland, which is rough to say considering how many deaths there still were over it.\n\nThey have also used the debt to fund highly expensive Government programs, so one could argue that this also helps back the country. In a better world, it would be nice if countries could at least decide/agree with each other to use the vast majority of their debt capacity on building better infrastructure all the time, funding scientific research, educating its people thoroughly rather than just wanting them to be dumb consumers and workhorses, maybe more cultural activities that give the country a unique identity... instead of gigantic militaries. I suppose that would be difficult realistically, because of one simple emotion: paranoia.\n\nDebt is also a way to force/motivate people into doing more work, so in this regard the debt of the citizens supports the country's workforce. If they cancelled all student debt, or even a percentage of it, I would imagine it going a few potential ways: Either the Government only cancels public debt (those who got their loan from the Government) meaning private loans that people took from banks get no help. Or if they want to help everyone equally, they decide to take on more Sovereign debt to pay the banks and save them the losses. Or they just decide to F the banks and clear it which would do damage to the banking industry (probably the least likely thing, banks practically own Governments).\n\nIn any case here, if people were freed of all or some of their debts, depending on how much it is, more people would probably opt to work less hours, do an easier job that pays less, on the positive side, more may try to become entrepreneurs, which is a positive thing for the future but takes time to show results for the country, and of course many would fail.\n\nThis is all preferable as far as the Government is concerned over a Gold/Bitcoin standard, BUT, a Country that has reached the point where its currency will collapse from the inflation all the debt creates (new money circulating in the system), will cause a desperation and the Country may have no choice but to break out their commodity reserves and make a deal with their people that they can buy these resources (Gold, Silver, Bitcoin, Oil, Corn, whatever) directly from the Government's reserves at a nice discount, thus giving new value to the currency. They could also jack up interest rates until everyone is hoarding fiat and prices collapse instead, along with jobs, but they would need to raise it a lot, it would also hurt the Government itself and its ability to support more of its own debt, and of course, the banking industry when it gets to the point where very few in the country are willing to take their loans.\n\nSo, I personally think when the chips are down, they're more likely to go with a new Standard before really raising interest rates to where they'd need to be.",
