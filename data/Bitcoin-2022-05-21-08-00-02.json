            "selftext": "This is my first time using bitcoin ever and because I started in \"shitcoins,\" sent some BTC to my little brother and a day later decided to track all of my funds to ensure I actually owned everything on the blue wallet.\n\nAfter checking two blockchain explorers I was scared shitless to find out my BTC wasn't on either of my receiving address on the blue wallet. All that was there was a big fat 0.0000, 0 transactions. I checked a few other wallets to see if I was just unaware of what bitcoin actually is and my little brothers address had all of his transactions on there along with another bitcoin address I no longer use.\n\nI then tried tracking the BTC I was purchasing and saw that every on ramp receipt, every exchange receipt had a different Bitcoin address on it. I was very confused because I was certain my addresses were not Lightning wallets. I looked around on the app and finally found the addresses with the BTC on them.\n\nI've never known about Bitcoin doing this normally and was informed that this is what the Lightning Network is supposed to be, not Bitcoins L1. Is this normal in software wallets or did my wallet turn into something it wasn't supposed to? Does the single private key have access to all of these addresses? Am I able to move all of these addresses if I wanted to? Am I missing something here?",
