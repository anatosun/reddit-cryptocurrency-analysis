            "selftext": "The answer here is nobody knows.\n\nMy target is to put 12.5k dollars (dirty fiat) into BTC by EoY starting september when i\u2019ll have the funds to do that. essentially buying 3k btc a month for 4 months. I\u2019m lump summing here because the bottom will hopefully be roughly around this time but I could miss the bottom over summer period which is a possibility.\n\nAfter this i\u2019ll DCA in total another 5k in 2023 ready for the next Btc halving where using extrapolation, from the halving it should roughly 2/3x ROUGHLY turning 15k dollars into 45k bare in mind it could be more if i\u2019m buying at the bottom so let\u2019s say 60k. Remember I can\u2019t predict the market.\n\nMy target is 0.5 Btc by January 2024 and 0.65 Btc by 2030. \n\nRealistically, by 2024 and in total putting in 15k dollars into BTC, could I reach my target of 0.5 Bitcoin? \n\n30 year plan:\n\nIf BTC got to let\u2019s say 50% of the gold market cap by 2030 with a price of about 335/400k, 350*0.65 = 227k. Rough maths i know. If 100% market cap then 500k so let\u2019s say 150-500k dollars by 2030. \n\nLet\u2019s say I sell BTC by then and diversify into stocks property and staking with an average return of 6% yearly compound interest saving 5k a year into investments for the next 20 years assuming 2% inflation, I could turn the 200k into 3.3 million dollars and then live off passive income and retire by 50.\n\nOr sell not all BTC, have 20% BTC, 20% stocks, 20% property etc but still compound interest to 3.3m\n\nAm I crazy? I know I KNOW this is so many assumptions but 0.65 Btc could be life changing. I need *perspective*",
