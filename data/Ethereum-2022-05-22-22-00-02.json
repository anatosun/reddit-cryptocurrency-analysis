Like shown here: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/2466/how-do-i-send-an-arbitary-message-to-an-ethereum-address\n\nThe recipient will not get notified, so he has to check his address with certain periodicity. Or he can use a block-explorer (e.g. etherscan) that checks his address and sends him an email when he receives a transaction. \n\nThe message sent this way will be publicly recorded on the blockchain and everyone can see its contents. If you want it to be private you can encrypt using his public address which is essentially a public key for which he holds the private key (not sure if this is possible, as the public address derivation form the private key is not straightforward). You would need to communicate this to the recipient some way, otherwise he would be left scratching his head not knowing what to do with the message he received. You could use a non-encrypted message to his address as explained above that details the instructions for decryption and then send the encrypted messages.",
