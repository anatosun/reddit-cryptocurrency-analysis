I would say set your desired limits & predicted prices but continue to DCA at least a little bit in the meantime. 30k isn\u2019t a bad price, a lot of people are underwater & this could be a good chance to average down cost basis. If you\u2019re trading sure maybe time things but if you\u2019re long & hodling, this is a great time to buy. Nothing is guaranteed so if Bitcoin rips you don\u2019t wanna get left behind",
