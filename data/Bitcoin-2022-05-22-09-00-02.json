It may not sound like much to some but I have hope that one day it might help me out to buy a house using this amount. \n\nI have been stacking sats for the past year and a half and just putting bits in when ever I can. If you can take anything away from this, it\u2019s not about how fast you can make your money. It\u2019s all about the journey of making money and averaging into the market is the easiest, safest way IMO! \n\nMy next goal is now 0.25 it\u2019s probably gonna take another year or 2 but I know I can do it. Until then\u270c\ufe0f",
