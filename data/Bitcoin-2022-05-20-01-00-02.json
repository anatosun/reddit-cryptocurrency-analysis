Gold-backed currency doesn't work in a world where bitcoin has introduced transparent, trustless, paperless, and neutral money on a single network that enforces rules, with an asset which happens to be harder than gold (exponentially harder with time). The Ruble's strength actually has to do with the price of oil (Venezuela's currency is also a super stable currently), but oil isn't a payment network that is transparent, doesn't move at the speed of light, or settle instantly.

It's actually not really used for anything that interesting. A tiny bit goes into computers and some chemical processing but not enough to justify the price. Most gold goes into jewelry or as gold bars / some form of wealth. \n\nThe value is because humans like it that's about it. A hunk of uranium is about a million times more useful to society but value =/= usefulness under our current economic systems.\n\nIt's also worth noting that fiat and crypto are both more useful then gold even, because they both fall under the criteria and definitions of what makes money, 'money'. Gold also fits some of these criteria but not quite as well as fiat and crypto",

Did gold just become half as valuable? Did Goldman Sachs effectively suppress the precious metals market? Etc. etc.",
