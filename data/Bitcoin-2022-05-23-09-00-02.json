There's different tiers of rarity depending on the shirt attributes and that way every one has equal chance at pulling out the Satoshi. All the shirts are one of one though, which makes this whole project unique, but the Satoshi is \"the rarest of the rare. So basically only place someone can handpick the Satoshi 21 shirt is in the secondary market.",
