            "selftext": "Have you ever wanted to sleep and earn income? That's exactly what passive income is.\u00a0 Your money works for you. True Wealth creation comes from long term holds combined with passive income. That is the goal of the MINE token. To have a life altering impact on you as holders. It might be as small as funding that cup of coffee on the way to work each morning, to purchasing that dream house or even more! Only you can know what you can afford to invest.\u00a0 Please invest wisely and only what you are comfortable losing as investments of any kind carry risk. Dream big when you get into MINE, because we are! We have lofty goals and want to share those rewards with those who have supported us as we take this journey. \n\nRight now you can get in super early at very low price. Investing in MINE is like putting money into a retirement account. It may go up and down along the way but you know at the end of the day it's the right way for future income. Not to mention the ETH reflections you gain by holding. The reflections are like dividends. They are\nbased on 6% of the trading volume which is equally distributed among every holder. Personal experience has already shown me it beats any interest rate you recieve from the bank. \n\nNot only does MINE use the development for buying mining equipment to mine its own eth, which creates a far larger ROI it combines it with 6% eth reflections. 100% of the mined eth goes towards buybacks feeding into the holders at the same time it's increasing the scarcity and eventually building towards becoming hyper deflationary. \n\nCome check out our links below. \n\nWebsite: https://theofficialminetoken.io/ \n\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/MINE_Token/\n\nToken Address: 0x84bb61eb0336b309ccf14cc68bd1888cfa4846ea",
