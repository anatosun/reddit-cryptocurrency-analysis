            "selftext": "\"This reorg is not an indicator of a flawed fork choice, but a non-trivial segmentation of updated vs out of date client software,\" said Preston Van Loon, a Core Ethereum developer.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ethereum's Beacon Chain underwent a seven-block reorganization, or reorg, ahead of the Merge, which is tentatively scheduled for August. \n\nAccording to Beacon Scan data, seven blocks from 3,887,075 to 3,887,081 were removed from the Beacon Chain on Wednesday between 08:55:23 and 08:56:35 am UTC. Ethereum is a transaction network similar to Tron and Concordium which is much faster than the Solana network.\n\nThe term \"reorg\" refers to an event in which a canonical chain block, such as the Beacon Chain, is knocked off the chain due to a competing block beating it out.\n\nIt could be the result of a malicious attack by a resourceful miner or a bug. In such cases, the chain may unintentionally fork or duplicate. \n\nOn this occasion, developers believe that the problem is a result of circumstance rather than a serious flaw such as a security flaw or fundamental flaw, with a \"proposer boost fork\" being highlighted in particular. This is a method of selecting the next block in the blockchain in which specific proposers are given priority.\n\nCore According to Ethereum developer Preston Van Loon, the reorg was caused by a \"non-trivial segmentation\" of new and old client node software and was not necessarily malicious. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, called the theory a \"good hypothesis.\" \nOn Wednesday morning, Martin K\u00f6ppelmann, co-founder of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible Gnosis chain, was among the first to highlight the occurrence via Twitter, noting that it \"shows that the current attestation strategy of nodes should be reconsidered to hopefully result in a more stable chain! (proposals already exist).\" \n\nVan Loon tentatively attributed the reorg to the proposer boost fork, which had not yet been fully implemented, in response to K\u00f6ppelmann:\n\n\u201cWe suspect this is caused by the implementation of Proposer Boost fork choice has not fully rolled out to the network. This reorg is not an indicator of a flawed fork choice, but a non-trivial segmentation of updated vs out of date client software.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of the details will be made public once we have a high degree of confidence regarding the root cause. Expect a post-mortem from the client development community!\u201d he added.\n\nTerence Tsao, another developer, echoed this hypothesis to his 11,900 Twitter followers earlier on Thursday, noting that the reorg appeared to be caused by \"boosted vs. non-boosted nodes in the network and the timing of a really late arriving block:\" \n\n\"Given that the proposer boost is a non-binding change. Because of the asymmetry in the client release schedule, the roll-out occurred gradually. \"Not all nodes updated the proposer boost at the same time.\"\n\nVan Loon stated last week at the Permissionless conference that the Merge and switch to proof-of-stake (PoS) could happen in August \"if everything goes as planned.\" \n\nWhile the reorganization is bound to raise concerns about the potential timeline, Van Loon and the other developers have yet to explain whether it will have any effect at all.",

Roughly speaking - the only way to prevent reorgs is to set up the blockchain in a way that it is at risk at stopping at some point altogether. \n> Now, I still don't agree with takes like: \"7 blocks is only 84 seconds\"/ \"you should wait for finality anyway\"/ \"this is not an issue\".\n> The reality is, that a 7-block reorg has not happened in years on Ethereum and it could have caused significant pain for many applications. \n> If this would have happened afer the merge it essentially would allow for replaying all DEX-trades, oracle updates, liquidations, and much more that happened in those 7 blocks in any order creating massive MEV at the cost of the user. \n> So I would say unless there is a damn good reason (global issues with the internet infrastructure, a massive attack of a very large validator, ...) a 7 block re-org SHOULD NOT happen! \n> So far that all sounds like bad news for Ethereums POS, right? Luckily there is an answer to why it happened and the cause is something not fundamental to Ethereum POS but instead something that could and SHOULD be prevented in the future! \n> The reason was that clients updated their behavior on what they consider the \"best block\". Consider the following situation. You are n+4 and this is what you see. You need to decide whether to continue on n+3 or on n+2.\n> Image\n> First, you might think: n+3 was an attacker and purposefully ignored n+2 to try to (ex-post) reorg n+2. However - it is also possible that n+2 was deliberately holding back its block giving n+3 no other choice than to build on n+1 (ex-ante reorg). \n> Depending on how the majority of clients behave in n+4 situation, it will either make it easier for an attacker to perform ex-post or ex-ante reorgs. Now, research showed that previously ex-post reorgs were very hard to do but ex-ante reorgs were somewhat possible. \n> The change in client behavior: \"proposer boost\" was meant to find a better balance to be safer against both kinds of attacks. However - the way this change was rolled out in the network: I would call today a mistake! \n> While it technically was not a consensus-breaking change (clients with both implementations will still come to consensus with each other eventually) - changing the rules of what to consider the best block *FOR SOME CLIENTS* will make reorgs much more likely. \n> So what happened is, that different client implementations rolled out this update at different time,s and also validators updated at different times. Finally, leading to a situation where roughly 50% of the network would use rule A and 50% rule B. \n> My conclusion is: changes like this should be rolled out like hard-forks. With a specific point in time (slot number) when they activate and a clearly communicate expectation for all validators to have updated at that time. \n> So - long story short: if in the future such updates are approached more mindful there is no reason to believe that we will experience 7 block deep reorgs in the future of Ethereum POS regularly.",

It could be enough that they lose control of the state and the network implodes. At the very least they'll lose control of the Beacon Chain. Attacker will have their off-chain derivatives and cross chain shorts/collateralizations ready the day before.
