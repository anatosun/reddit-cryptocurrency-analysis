It's used doing proof-of-work hashes. This proof-of-work is what makes the ledger unalterable and prevents cheating.\n\nIf you try to cheat your bank (or the other way around) then the police and court system get involved. There's no technical reason your bank cant just send your money to somebody else. What's keeping them from doing that is trust, and the legal system. But bitcoin cant just be sent to somebody else without following the rules. It's technical impossible.",

That's understandable as this is an uncommon topic of discourse outside of Cypher punk and Austrian economist circles.\n\nIt's not useful to think of it as the cost of confirming the transactions. It's the cost of nakamoto consensus, of digital scarcity, of securing the most sound form of money ever invented.\n\nSome power companies like miners as they provide a flexible base load that makes building power plants worth it. So that's one thing. \n\nUSD aka the petro dollar is backed by the fact that oil (energy) is sold in dollars. You know how many bad dictators were installed and governments destabilized to keep this in place? It's nuts. Let's not forget the immeasurable, aggregate misery of the hidden tax of inflation.

Whenever you send BTC, your wallet broadcasts the transaction to the network, and it gets added to the \"mempool\" of pending transactions.\n\n> Why does it take a lot of time to transfer a bitcoin?\n\nI wouldn't say it's a *lot* of time. Traditional transactions may *appear* instant, but actual *settlement* can still take days, but that's beside the point:\n\nThis really is the true genius of Bitcoin. In order to maintain a universally accepted \"correct\" version of the ledger, you need everyone to agree on the *order* in which transactions happened, otherwise you could have issues like \"double spending\" of coins.\n\nThe way bitcoin does this is to package up a bunch of transactions into a \"block\", with each block linked to the previous block in a way that can't be undone.\n\nThat way, we can just check that all the transactions in a particular block are valid (e.g. no double spends).\n\nEach miner competes to put together the next block, and whoever solves a valid block defines the transaction order. On average this happens every 10 minutes.\n\n> Who pockets the fee when transacting via bitcoin?\n\nThe lucky miner who finds the next valid block gets to award themselves a fixed reward (coinbase reward), and also pockets the transaction fees.",

It is similar to lottery with the difference only the first winner matters.\n\nThis explanation is quite simplified.

Seems too easy to crumble the system if all it takes is one bad ledger holder to start altering and freezing accounts.\n\nWhat you're describing is tangentially related to a \"51% attack\", and in reality it is impossible.The basis of Proof of Work (POW) is SHA256. SHA256 Hashing is a one way function, meaning if I give you an input you can verify the output, but given an output, you cannot realistically find an input that corresponds to the hash. Each block utilizes the hash of the previous block in its input, so if you want to modify the chain, you would have to recompute a valid chain from the block you modified to the current block. This requires out-competing millions of incredibly fast computers specially designed and built to run this network, effectively making this task impossible. Satoshi described this in his original white papers. Attacking the network is prohibitively expensive, and given that have the hardware, it is more profitable to support the network rather than attack it. This is one of the most beautiful aspects of BTC. Your self interests naturally lie with supporting the network.",

If you are not careful, then you will have a few options but it will be unlikely you can recover the funds. You can go to the authorities, you can alert exchanges, they can trace the movement of the crypto and sieze it if the thieves give custody to an exchange at some point, or try to cash out somewhere traceable. But it's a difficult process.\n\nWe are creating a padded world for people who are the type to skewer themselves in the eyeball when they are lended scissors. It will have less agency but more managers for you to complain to and have things reversed. You would keep your crypto with an exchange and have a card with them, and it would give you all those types of protections from yourself, including make it impossible for you to send your crypto into another dimension, even if you were determined to destroy your own assets in this way.",

Crypto people will then say you should have done this and that to protect yourself. They are right but you have to be fairly knowledgeable to not get scammed. Another issue is that people aren\u2019t using Crypto as it was meant to be used. Many merchants don\u2019t accept Crypto and even if they do it takes time for the transaction to go through plus you need to pay a transaction fee to use Crypto. Many Crypto advocates say buy and hold Crypto with the idea that the value of Crypto will go up just as a stock will go up. Stocks represent ownership in a company that makes  something but Crypto doesn\u2019t make anything, it just sits there. People who own Crypto want others to buy their Crypto at a higher price than what they paid for it. This is the greater fool idea that a greater fool than you will buy your Crypto. However at some point we run out of greater fools. The whole popularity of Crypto isn\u2019t because it is an alternative currency but rather that some people bought Bitcoin at 25 cents per coin and it is now worth $37,000 per coin making them millionaires.

                            "response": "By removing the leverage. Look, let's run a thought experiment.\n\nIf you have a town that is cut off from the world, a little economy, and in that economy is 10 million dollars, and there are 1,000 productive people in the town, then let's say you have a GDP per person of 10,000 dollars.\n\n1,000 productive people can do all kinds of things, like building houses, producing food and running businesses down to performing security or waitressing etc. These people will do those things for money, because they can use the money for goods and services from others in the town.\n\nNow there's no other economy in my thought experiment, so people in this town will pay what seems to be the right price for things, and with only 10 million dollars in that economy, things will be relatively cheap in comparison to what we're used to. The average annual salary would be something like 5,000 dollars, and buying a home would likely be in the vicinity of 25,000 dollars, groceries for the week may be something like 25 dollars.\n\nBut who controls this money? Well, there's always someone who manages to gain more power than others in a group, and that person in this instance is the town mayor who is also the owner of the dam, where the town's water comes from. This is the man who, early on, put himself in charge of these \"dollars\" and he decides to run a scheme to make himself even more powerful.\n\nHe's very charismatic and clever, and convinces the town that if he prints more dollars, the town's productiveness will increase ten fold! The town is convinced and so the 10 million dollar economy becomes a 100 million dollar economy. Now, this is where you can understand a few things... when you take the towns token, a \"dollar\", that represents a portion of the towns labor and resources, and 10X it, do you get 10X more labor and resources? No, you don't, what you get is prices going up 10X. The mayor is the one printing, so he directs the new money to his allies in the town, and most of the people actually end up with less comparative value in their control at the end of the printing, their salaries not keeping up with inflation, whilst the mayor has consolidated power in himself and his allies.\n\nThat's what banks do. They introduce leverage to the system which increases the money supply, which makes everything more expensive, but they tell you it's okay because, well, look at all the new money in the economy! That's more production right? Except the thing about that is, because they are the ones that print the money (well its digital nowadays), they are closest to the money spigot, and they take the highest percentage of that new money that is created by directing it to allies and charging interest to everybody on money that costs them nothing to create.\n\nBitcoin deflates that bubble of money, and brings it back to your hands. 1 BTC = 1 BTC and there is no bank that can undermine the value of what you have by printing more BTC. With that deflation, comes the deflation of the prices of housing, clothes, food etc. You experience that as the value of BTC going up, but its actually the price of everything else going down in respect to BTC.\n\n**TL;DR: It fixes the Cantillon effect.**",

I've been investing since the mid 80's.\n\nThere's always some new *thing* that's going to get you rich.   The idea is to sell something at a profit that cost you as little as possible. Often you can do this by pointing at something and claiming *it* is the problem and that you have the solution for it.   Bitcoin is no different.\n\nYou know who has gotten massively rich selling something that was totally worthless at the time?   The person or persons who created Bitcoin and sold people on it being the latest and greatest investment.   They mined on cheap desktops and got Bitcoin for nothing more than the cost of electricity.  They even created something to blame so you could believe what they were selling was the solution.  \n\n The people who got in early purchased cheap and have been basically flipping Bitcoin. That's what you are trying to do.  Hoping to get in cheap so you can sell/trade at a profit later.\n\nI played with it for a while but took it serious when it hit $8k.   I bought in and have been profiting on the rising cost without ever buying into the entire \"bitcoin is the future\" mantra.   Because I've heard that speech a thousand times before.

Cash is just a convenient format for transferring wealth that requires no technology to use person to person once it is produced. You can destroy the presses and still cause inflation.\n\nThere are two primary reasons why inflation happens. The perceived value of wealth and the desire for profit. \n\nSimply switching to another currency will not stop inflation. You have to protect the value of labor and restrict the amount profit that manufacturers and retailers can make. \r  \n\r  \nOn the topic of the value of wealth....   In pretty much every system on the planet (including Bitcoin) the value of wealth is based on labor.\r  \n\r  \nYou know how much fiat and bitcoin is worth to you based on how much of it you can earn in an hour. I know that I can trade one hours labor for $32 of product. You do the same based on however much you earn an hour. You do it subconsciously. That's how you determine when something is too expensive.\r  \n\r  \nWhenever the cost of labor goes up, inflation goes up. It always has. It always will. Because the businesses that exist to create profit are going to pass that cost on to its customers, and possibly use it as a way to create more profit.  The currency you choose to use is of little matter to them, as long as you pay the increased price.\r  \n\r  \n\rI remember when I was making $1.85 an hour (which was .45 above minimum wage) and thinking the jump in minimum wage to $3.35 would solve all my problems. It did. For about 6 months. Then inflation followed and I was back to being able to trade 1 hours labor for the exact same thing I could when I was at $1.85, maybe even less.\r  \n\r  \n\r\rThere was little inflation in the U.S. during the time that wages and prices were frozen. It was multiple years later that inflation rose again, mostly due to poor oversight and control.\n\nThe only reason that Bitcoin is staying ahead of inflation right now is because it is rising in value.  Exactly the same way multiple stock have done in the past.    Once those values level out, inflation starts taking away at the value.  Bitcoin will level out in value.  Like everything else, we simply don't know where that will be.",

There's no percentage for the fee, it stays the same no matter the size of the transaction, and theres the lightning network with extremely low fees for small transactions.\n\noh, you got on the train late? sounds like you never got on buddy. Its actually still not late, but it will be when you finally do get on. And even then, that is when the volatility subsides and it becomes the long term store of value its meant to be.\n\nrich cats forking? more like an example of the democratic nature of choosing ones fork.",

If you pay, they'll ask for more money. So no. Please don't believe these scammers.",
