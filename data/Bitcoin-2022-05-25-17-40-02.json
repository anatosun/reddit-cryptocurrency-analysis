Milton Friedman argued in his book Capitalism and Freedom that economic freedom, while itself an extremely important component of absolute freedom, is also a necessary condition for political freedom. He claimed that centralized control of economic activities is always accompanied by political repression. In his view, the voluntary character of all transactions in an unregulated market economy and the wide diversity of choices that it permits pose fundamental threats to repressive political leaders by greatly diminishing their power to coerce people economically. Through the elimination of centralized control of economic activities, economic power is separated from political power and each can serve as a counterbalance to the other. Friedman feels that competitive capitalism is especially important to minority groups since impersonal market forces protect people from discrimination in their economic activities for reasons unrelated to their productivity. In The Road to Serfdom, Friedrich Hayek offered a similar argument: \"Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends\". Amplifying their arguments, it has often been pointed out that increasing economic freedoms tends to raise expectations on political freedoms, eventually leading to democracy.  \n\nI like parts of it, but I feel monopolies need to be prevented and/or broken up, for example.  \n\n*Fascinating stuff to ponder.*",

                    "response": "Hi\n\nThis is an interesting idea and I\u2019m using something similar internally to quickly deploy bitcoin nodes. I had a few bad experience with hardware failing like 5 times in a row forcing me to redownload re confirm everything from the beginning which is annoying.\n\nWhen connected for the first time a new node do two things: It first download the complete history of the blockchain and then confirms everything block by block ensuring all UTXO are valid. Even when running a pruned node this process will be done. Pruning will only reduce the size on the hard drive. This can take several days if the hardware is not powerful enough and will always grow over time.\n\nIn theory, to reduce the bandwidth usage we could simply download the last few GB of blocks and an up to date UTXO set. The problem now becomes, who will you trust with this UTXO set. What is the guarantee that nothing was tempered with? And the answer is nothing, of course I can put on Dropbox an updated UTXO set but you would have to trust me to not modify anything in it.\n\nThis is why everything is downloaded and validated in the first place, to make sure nothing was modified. Adding the current state of the UTXO set to every block would change the dynamic of mining and be a potentially intensive process, furthermore the internal state of mempool across all nodes are slightly different, some transactions are not yet relayed to all node, etc so it would be impractical.\n\nNow, let me introduce a hybrid approach. Through a Bitcoin softfork we could every 2 weeks when there is the difficulty adjustment introduce the hash of the UTXO set a few blocks before (eg: 50 blocks before) to avoid any uncertainty in case of history rewriting. This periodical commitment would introduce a reference that can be later used to speed up the initial sync. The way this would be done to be backward compatible is to have an OP RETURN transaction signed by address of the miner who mined the block with the hash of the UTXO set. We let this run for 6 months so it becomes ossified. Because it would only happens roughly every 2 weeks and for the UTXO set 50 blocks before it could be easily recomputed by miners and node without adding too much computing overhead.\n\nNow when you spin up a new node, you have a new option called Fast track UTXO commitment. A node with this enabled would download a few recent blocks, then figure out the current block height, then it would go around 6 months in the past and start downloading the UTXO set from 6 months ago + all the blocks until now.\n\nThe validation process would be the following: Check that the UTXO hash of the set correspond to the hash that was published 6 months ago and start validating everything from 6 months ago until now. This would reduce the amount of bandwidth and computing power to run your own node and could open the door to have nodes inside phones and very low power hardware in places where high bandwidth access is limited.\n\nThe 6 month ossification window ensure that the cost of attacking a node during this initial synchronization would be at least of 6 months of producing a fake chain. Depending on the threat model this could be extended however I think its acceptable. If during initial block download someone faces an adversary powerful enough to have the majority of nodes sending fake data, they could as well fake it from the beginning.\n\nWhat I do internally is something similar, I have a backup of the UTXO set of a few months ago and I use it to quickly restore nodes in case of failure.\n\nIMHO this could even be proposed as a Bip so we could discuss about the implication of periodical UTXO commitment.",

More accurately, the coinbase transaction has no signatures because every node expects to validate it against consensus rules. If your coinbase transaction pays 50 BTC in 2022, your block is invalid, not propagated  \n\nI'll be expecting to verify the checkpoint hash of the UTXO set if it's part of the coinbase transaction, so I don't need a miner to sign it, and I don't trust that it's correct just because the miner signed it  \n\nThis is where the idea breaks  \n\nMy node is not built to verify a hash of a database containing 50 million entries within the time it normally takes to validate and propagate a new block  \n\nI don't trust the miner's UTXO checkpoint hash.

Here are results from my node:\n\n    ~$ time bitcoin-cli gettxoutsetinfo\n    {\n      \"height\": 737930,\n      \"bestblock\": \"00000000000000000002e6cae9fb55f131b619dd72ec5bc2242bd10b6c164be9\",\n      \"transactions\": 49497197,\n      \"txouts\": 82083387,\n      \"bogosize\": 6127690147,\n      \"hash_serialized_2\": \n    \"1f965ae02e0277c79a7fb64245eaac13cc090bc74b0a19cee895a7d82e4ca745\",\n      \"disk_size\": 5033459269,\n      \"total_amount\": 19049354.67914707\n    }\n    \n    real\t1m15.244s\n    user\t0m0.005s\n    sys\t0m0.000s\n\nSo it currently takes a little over 1.25 minutes (75 seconds) for my node to hash all UXTO set entries. The proposal that /u/Acceptable-Analyst30 put forth would give *50* average block intervals (30,000 seconds) for this to be computed -- e.g. the UTXO set from block 800,000 would only be committed in block 800,050. Since 75 seconds is a lot shorter than 30,000 seconds, my node is about 400 times faster than the minimum speed necessary to compute or verify a hash of the current UTXO set within the time it normally takes to validate and propagate that 50th block.\n\nMind you, this can also be improved. For reference, this is on a Core i7 4790k (released 8 years ago) with an old SATA SSD. The `gettxoutsetinfo` RPC call is single-threaded and not well optimized, as it's rarely used, so it should be taken as an upper bound for the amount of time it takes to compute a UTXO commitment. With some work, this could probably be dropped to 1/4 of the current time. For example, another way I can compute a hash of the UTXO set is to simply hash the entire database files using Blake2B:\n\n    ~$ time cat .bitcoin/chainstate/* | b2sum\n    4d9733f88e0a6c12f4922ee0e9a0bfc87bc3be1026aa7d92db3ae64e3310364638259ec0eb98f90a7d0d9c6cf7e9a6f7b59c558fa61aac17b1e9b43638363252  -\n        \n    real\t0m33.462s\n    user\t0m8.363s\n    sys\t0m3.855s\n\nThis is *still* single-threaded, and (at least on my machine) purely I/O bound (`cat`ing the data to `/dev/null` takes 32 seconds while reading at 142 MB/s), but it's already about 2x as fast.",

                                    "response": "> if the history is even needed if the current state can be proofed with less data\n\nThis is a deep rabbithole. Superficially, the answer is that we don't need the transactions if there is sufficient transaction data in the UTXO set. Obviously, there is sufficient data, because pruned nodes don't need to keep the old blocks after downloading them and verifying them  \n\nThis might appear to be tangential, but it's fundamental ...  \n\nIn IT application systems design, there is a concept called \"system of record\". That is, if you have redundant copies of various data elements scattered through the system (eg fast lookup indexes), or totals and subtotals stored for the convenience of avoiding recalculation overhead, those things can be discarded and rebuilt/recalculated from the system of record  \n\nIn the 1960s the system of record in a major corporation was the paper files in the compactus filing system on the otherwise-unoccupied archive floor at HQ, possibly with microfiche backup  \n\nAs data capacity improved, the system of record became a collection of half-inch tapes, which were updated with transactions collected on punch cards, nightly or weekly - old tapes in, new tapes out  \n\nBy the 1980s the disk copy of the database was being updated in real time, not delayed to overnight, and the tapes become obsolete, except as nightly backups of the database on disk. The disk database is the system of record, not the backup tape  \n\nand so on. I'm not sure IT history is an exciting topic  \n\nIn Bitcoin, the system of record is the blockchain. The whole cumbersome method of laying down block after block in sequential files which are written but never updated (except for chaintip reorgs) is a near-perfect implementation of a non-database system of record  \n\nSo, what's the chainstate (UTXO set)? It's just a fast lookup index of a subset of the data in the blockchain, the most important data for proving the right to spend and preventing double spending  \n\nHow do we know it's accurate? We built it from the blockchain, transaction by transaction, block by block  \n\nIs it still accurate if we pass copies around the Internet and rely on checkpoint hashes? It might not be, if there's a bug in the checkpointing system  \n\nDoes that matter?  \n\nNo, because we can always fix it by rebuilding the UTXO set from the blockchain  \n\nOh, but we don't have any unpruned copies of the blockchain any more",
