            "selftext": "According to data given by Chainalysis, Argentina is one of the countries in Latin America with a high crypto usage rate. Because of inflation and exchange limitations, some inhabitants of the country have turned to crypto and bitcoin. \n\nThis is why Bitcoin Argentina, a non-profit devoted to the growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem in Argentina, has chosen to establish a Bitcoin teaching project for high school students.\n\nThe \"Schools and Bitcoin\" project, which was created in collaboration with the humanitarian organization Built with Bitcoin, intends to educate high school students about this innovative alternative finance system. According to Jimena Vallone of Bitcoin Argentina, the project is a continuation of a previous pilot project in which students from Argentina exhibited significant passion and interest in learning about Bitcoin. She elaborated:\n\nThere is a strong drive to develop, learn about Bitcoin and blockchain, and train and learn. All of this served as a springboard for thinking about the project, which will initially involve 40 schools but will eventually include a greater number.\n\nThe core will be ,  pupils learning about Bitcoin's \"transparent, open, inclusive, traceable, and secure\" characteristics. This is said to be the first project of its sort in Latin America, where countries such as Brazil and Venezuela are known to be active in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe approval of the education initiative is significant in light of the debt restructuring agreement between Argentina and the International Monetary Fund, which included a section recommending that the government restrict the usage of cryptocurrency in Argentina.\n\nIn my opinion introducing kids , teenagers  to bitcoin would surely help in the global expansion of Bitcoin. Introducing kids early to the innovative nature of blockchain technology and how Bitcoin can create a  more globally inclusive and secure global financial system. Teenagers could also learn of how application of the  blockchain technology in business, government and the society in general could create a more transparent system of operation. This will surely in the long run pay off has a comprehensive knowledge of Bitcoin and it can improve our financial system would create more Bitcoiners. \n\nThe blockchain ecosystem is experiencing  phenomenal growth and expansion with an ever increasing number of innovative and interesting  that caters to divers needs  Decentraland  an online world that allows users to create their own avatars and purchase plots of virtual land, Planet Maya which is powered by champions games is  a decentralized and collaborative online casino which allows developers to build Games around betting, Luckyblock which  is a digital asset project that decentralizies the lottery process via blockchain technology. Silks a blockchain-based metaverse that enables users to own, trade, and profit from thoroughbred racing horses. In the near future blockchain technology would be an essential part of the global society due to it's innovative nature. \n\nWell teaching Kids about Bitcoin and blockchain technology is surely the way to go. If I had teenage kids I would ensure that they are adequately educated about Bitcoin and it will in coming years become the standard for global exchange of monetary value.\n\nNews Source: \nhttps://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-argentina-ngo-to-take-crypto-education-to-schools/",
