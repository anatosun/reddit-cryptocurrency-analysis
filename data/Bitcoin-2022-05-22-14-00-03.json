Those that dont will become as disused as sidewalk telephone booths. In fact a lot of ATMs are running on NCR tech which has already partnered with Strike to provide lightning services.\n\nSoon every ATM will offer a choice when you use it, card or lightning. Selecting lightning will allow you to enter the amount of cash you desire followed by showing a lightning invoice on the screen. Scan the invoice with your phone and cash will be dispensed.\n\nThis is coming and it will be beautiful to behold.",
