I understand that pools use their collective computational resources to win rewards, but does anyone know if these pools require resource participants to run on the same block and/or protocol version?\n\nFor example, pool A has 30 resource contributors. Does the pool control what version of the protocol to use? Basically, I'm wondering what if a pool decides to run on a forked version and/or new blockchain?\n\nIf the pool controls what version of the protocol to run and which blocks to recognize, then only have 14 mining pools seems kinda dangerous and pretty centralized.\n\n**The reason I asked this question is because I want to see how the number of miners has increased/decreased over time. I would expect the number to decrease steadily over time as it becomes more difficult to get the rewards. If this is true, it would seem like Bitcoin is headed towards complete centralization at some point, no?**",

Today, the way miners keep pool operators honest is that it is very easy to just point your hardware at a new pool. So a pool operator engaging in shenanigans will quickly lose hashrate and revenue. So while it\u2019s not a great situation, it\u2019s not a huge deal in practice. \n\nRight now there are upgraded versions of these pool protocols under development that put block selection into miners hands, instead of pool operators. This will make block selection bunch more decentralized. \n\nYou\u2019re not going to find an accurate number around how many mining nodes are active. If i think there\u2019s 100 TH online somewhere, that could be one node, or two nodes each running at 50 TH, or 4 nodes, or \u2026 there is no central registry of mining nodes and there can\u2019t be, and thats by design. You want anyone to be able to start or stop whenever to make control of the network hard. \n\nI think the metric you\u2019re actually trying to track is network hashrate. This isn\u2019t knowable in an absolute sense, but can be estimated based on difficulty and average block times. LOTS of websites publish metrics around total network hashrate. If you see that number going up, it means more (and/or better) mining hardware is coming online. If you see it go down, it means mining hardware is being taken offline.",

If this is the case then I could see pools consolidating over time, but this is definitely speculation. \n\nThe one thing that you mentioned that makes me hopeful is putting block selection into the miners hands. If this becomes the norm among pools, then I think that would indeed help make Bitcoin much more decentralized. \n\nI'd like to look more into your point of \"keeping the pools honest\", because is it really that easy for a resource contributor to switch between pools? How quickly could they recognize wrongdoing by pools? How quickly could they act, i.e., how much damage could they do before corrective action could take place?  \n\nI obviously have a lot to learn, but it seems like this could be the achilles heel of Bitcoin and I don't hear anyone talking about it.

It's an industry-standard protocol, so moving your hashrate from one pool to another is usually something like: set up an account at the other pool (if they have an account system, not all do), and then change a setting in your mining software to point at the new pools stratum server, and you're done. So if you have a LOT of miners and don't have good automation, it can take some time to push out that configuration change, but it's not a huge engineering effort to move hashrate.  \n\n\n\\-One example of a next-gen protocol for this is Stratum v2, which is being sponsored by Braiins (the company that runs Slush Pool): [https://braiins.com/stratum-v2](https://braiins.com/stratum-v2) one of the many things that stratum v2 improves on is having individual miners do transaction selection. \n\nHave fun digging in and doing more research!",
