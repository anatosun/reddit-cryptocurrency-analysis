Unfortunatly due to cultural brainwashing, it is common for many to think of women as dependent on a man for his money. This leads to many problems e.g. domestic violence. Imagine a woman wanting to be a traditional housewife and caregiver and stay-at-home mother who marries a man and then the man just divorces her and and leaves her with the kids. She is now a single mother with no money, and if he keeps all his money in crypto, she cannot get any of it back via the divorce courts, so women need to get their own money so that they can be independent.",

Men also have feelings and emotions the same way females have, so why is the only acceptable \"emotions\" for men happy/angry? Why cant they be allowed to be sad, depressed, have a shitty day... Without being judged as \"feminine\" and something negative/weak? Its just how humans are, we all have emotions, instead most of our population are suffering from alexythymia/emotional blindness. \n\nWomen also support the patriarchy and help the concept of toxic masculinity to live by saying \"poor you/suck it up\".  Dividing allowed emotions up by gender its just such a ridiculous thing and its ruining our society. Why can't we just share the fun and joy of life as equals instead, I am sure it would be alot more fun for everyone! \n\n I would wish for a time where all genders gets treated equal from birth because it would be alot more harmony and joy...

Just that men might not like to be whiny about it, but deal with it. Most females, except those that have been hurt by a male, like a man who is stable, capable and rooted whether that be in his security or insecurities. They do not like a man that is showing weakness, as it would mean that the man will not be capable of maximizing the success of reproduction for the female, either in terms of providing good genes, or providing safety and resources.",

That's a better return than many stock dividends.  Also, the safemoon devs are going to integrate safemoon into the Gambian economy.  It won't be the nation's primary currency but, it will be an option which will cause holders, such as myself, to earn even more passive income.  They offer a potential 2.5 million new holders.  The safemoon exchange is another valuable tool in the crypto world.  It allows the users to earn passive income on ALL cryptos and not just safemoon.  Safemoon looks to be one of the few cryptos that offer such direct utility.",
