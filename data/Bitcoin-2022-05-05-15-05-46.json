                    "response": "Do you know how the words work?  The words are the numbers my dude. \n\nThe seed phrases are just binary simplified for human digestion. When you see 11111111111 in binary, that actually means \n\n1024+512+256+128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1\n\nWhen we add these together, we get 2047. There are 2048 BIP39 words (ranging from 0000 to 2047, sometimes represented by 1 thru 2048) so,\n\n11111111111 = zoo \n\nSubsequently, 00000000000 adds up to 0, and is recognized as the word Abandon. \n\nSo, there\u2019s really no feasible reason to do what you\u2019re talking about in your post, writing down every single 0 and 1, when you\u2019re actually already doing that by writing down the seed phrases in a way that\u2019s way more digestible to the human mind. \n\nTaking what we\u2019ve learned about binary, and seed phrases, spam a random 11 zeros and ones and then calculate the total of that string, then reference the BIP39 word list to see what word you got. \n\nExample: 01110010101 is 0+512+256+128+0+0+16+0+4+0+1=0917 which is the word Increase. \n\nNow, what\u2019s easier to remember? 01110010101 or increase ? Because they\u2019re identical to the bitcoin network. \n\nGoing into further detail, the keys are generated by randomly generating 253 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s, then all those numbers are used to generate what\u2019s called a SHA256 checksum, and whatever the first character is of the checksum determines the final three digits of the 256 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s that make up your private keys. \n\n\nSo, final answer, all the power to you to do whatever you want I guess but there\u2019s actually no benefit to doing what you\u2019re doing, and in fact it\u2019s honestly way more likely to cause you harm then good.\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt\n\nSo if you want, go grab your 256 digit string of numbers you want to engrave to a plate, take the first eleven digits, figure out what the total is based on how we calculated that earlier, and you will find your first word. Shouldn\u2019t take you long to bail on the idea of not using the words. Whether BIP39 standard stays or goes (but it stays, fyi) you\u2019ll always still be able to convert the words to numbers or the numbers to words if you know what you\u2019re doing.",

The downsides of this cause an economy built mostly on debt to sell their assets that have been doing well and people will still buy (tech stocks and btc included).  The fed will print again as the pain gets worse and they will need to \"bailout\" big industries with newly printed fiat.  \n\n\nIf you're wondering whether to buy / sell BTC, look back at daily discussions in 2017 - 2019, you'll most likely see your exact question or worry.  The only thing different is that those posters from less than 5 years ago were looking at prices like 3k, 10k, 1k.  The answer is build wealth long-term.  That's how rich people do it, by and large.  Plan 20 years out, don't try and win the lottery.\n\nHodl on.",

Regardless, I've regularly transferred my coins to cold storage. But over the last three months, I've continued to DCA and hadn't made a transfer. Wasn't really worried about it.\n\nWell, on Tuesday Coinbase disabled my account. I made an ACH that they later said failed. I followed the steps to resolve the issue but my account is still disabled. I can't buy, sell, or transfer. Tons of other people are experiencing the same issue. It almost seems like Coinbase is managing their liquidity and order flow by sacrificing the customer. Anyway, perhaps it's harmless but I can't shake the feeling that Coinbase is shady. As soon as my account is unfrozen, I'm getting out of there.\n\nIf I wanted to sell or needed the cash, I'd be completely screwed. No recource. 100% at the mercy of what they want to do. These exchanges are not safe places to lend your coins. Buy and get out!",

Very unlikely we hit previous ATH of 20k, we had no blow off top like previous cycles, so we are less likely to have 80% drops, buy orders at 30k are on stand by. 30k is most likely the bottom. The only reason we dip under 30k is if BTC's protocol is compromised or more probable, the loss of liquidity in other markets (Stocks, Bonds, RE). This is a risk on asset 100%. We all know it's the hardest money on the planet currently but that doesn't mean the market or world agrees. If it did, we'd all have a nice nest egg by now.",

However, these last few times it appears someone is exiting their short positions (which means the price usually increases as they close their positions) and the price is still dropping, so I assume they are selling actual bitcoin at the same time as exiting their short position? I don't understand why though. Anyone have any ideas? The only thing I can think of (and I don't know if this is reasonable) is that someone owns a bunch of bitcoin, they plan to sell, they know selling a bunch will dump the price so they open a bunch of shorts, sell their bitcoin, price drops, and they close short positions to make money on both sides?\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX%3ABTCUSDSHORTS](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX%3ABTCUSDSHORTS)",

If the idea of covenants is that you can create bitcoin that can only be sent to certain addresses, doesnt that make two classes of bitcoin?\n\nNo.  That's disinformation which, ironically, appears to be created and promoted by the creator of BIP119 as a strawman.\n\nYou're only paid in bitcoin if their payment exactly specifies the terms determined by your address.  If they do, then the funds are yours free and clear (or otherwise covered by terms you agree to),  if they don't you'll never see the payment at all.\n\nFor example,  imagine I owe you money.  Well it's possible for me to go dig a hole in my back yard put some money in a tupperware container marked \"TO: Ok_Aerie3546\" and bury it up.   Has the fungibility of the dollar been compromised because I stashed some under unreasonable conditions?  No: You just haven't been paid!\n\nThe author has also promoted some conspiracy theories about \"KYC bitcoin\"-- like that people might be coerced into accepting encumbered bitcoins that could only be spent with government approved counter-parties as a transparent excuse for the gratuitous limitations of 119, but this too is obvious nonsense:  If someone wanted to attempt that plain old multisignature would suffice to accomplish that (and because MPC ECDSA exists, it couldn't be blocked even if multisig were blocked in bitcoin!).  What prevents that is that people won't accept it, and anyone trying to impose it on you when they owe you funds would be guilty of theft, plain and simple.   (and you can wag your arms and say 'but what if a government tries to engage in theft' -- well that's always a possibility: they have the tanks and jails, after all).\n\nI think BIP119 is a poor proposal being pushed through in an ill advised way, but I think the concern you're raising isn't a legitimate one.\n\nI regret ever introducing the term covenant.  My intent was to point out that it was *inevitable* that any sufficiently expressive rules could allow for encumbrances that ran with the coin, and as a result one shouldn't generally accept encumbered coins unless you are extremely sure of what you are doing. Fortunately, there is no risk of doing so accidentally.  Just like the example with multisig shows it's already possible to create persistently encumbered coins and it's fundamentally impossible foreclose that possibility through technical means. The protection from it being a problem is already built into every single wallet out there: no wallet will accept/display a payment except under terms set by itself.  So the only way anyone could 'force' you to accept some encumbered coin is the same as their ability to just not pay you at all as they're the same thing.   Simultaneously, there are plenty of extremely useful, pro-security, pro-privacy, pro-autonomy ways people could conceivably temporarily encumber their own coins... sadly almost none of them are enabled by bip119.\n\nIf you're concerned about fungibility, go bother exchanges and minining pools that lock users to withdraw to a single address or don't support all common address types thereby denying users their choice of payment rules.",

Now, it's possible to send coins to rules which can never be completely satisfied e.g. by sending them to  1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE but at that point we just consider the coins destroyed (even though they're not actually \"destroyed\" they're just made useless).\n\nIf it makes it easier to imagine, imagine I instead suggested embedding the dollars in a 1 ton tungsten cube, such that it was impractical to ever get them out again. Doing this functionally destroys the dollars.\n\nIf you imagine that some people started trading around cubes of tungsten that contain former dollars as \"dollars\" (at some premium or discount) then you could squint and say there was some fungibility impact, but whatever impact there came from the willingness to trade and not for the inescapable possibility that someone could embed dollars in metal.\n\nYou can even see where people have tried to do this with bitcoin, e.g. by saying any bitcoins sent to some 'exodus' address would become some new scam coin.  They didn't damage the fungibility of bitcoin by creating two coins there, they just sold their coins (or destroyed them) in exchange for some scamcoin issuer issuing them scamcoins.\n\nImagining a world where some exchange or something wouldn't give you bitcoins but would only give you encumbered coins that required their permission to transact is pretty much identical to imagining them refusing to give you bitcoins and instead giving you some bitcoin unrelated scamcoin-- maybe one that they tried calling \"bitcoin\" (there are several scamcoins that market themselves on laughable claims of being the \"real bitcoin\").  They could do this today by refusing to pay you bitcoin and insisting on something else (like insisting on only using multisig with you, or insisting on paying you \"BSV\" instead, or whatever)-- if they owe you bitcoin and do this then they're stealing from you.  If they don't owe you and say that these are their rules, you're free to not do business with them.",

Like everyone was excited to auction off stuff on eBay back in the day, or send free eMails, and just search the WwW, but also centralized Apps as Facebook, Online Banking, Paypal, Netflix brought the Internet to the masses, and of course Smartphones. \n  \nSo with Bitcoin I feel like some stuff still needs to happen, I feel like the biggest issue is actually that a lot of people still have not realized how money works. That the government just keeps printing more of it, and that they will never in our lifetime start spending less. Actually they will always spend more. \n  \nIts not even sure yet what the interest rate hike by 0.5% will do, even if they keep adding 0.5% its not sure they will be able to stop inflation. And even with low inflation your dollar still always loses in value. \n  \nIf you consider there _COULD_ be 2 billion people some day using Bitcoin... If you relate that to about 18 Million Bitcoin available (probably more got lost, but lets assume 18m are still there), it would put Bitcoin-holdings for each person at just $111. Now even if you consider only 200 million people will use Bitcoin, thats still just $1111 put into Bitcoin by each person.\n  \nIf some day a lot of people can see the true value of the first independent payment and store of value network of our lifetime, people would easily put $5000 and more into bitcoin on average and that would actually put 1 bitcoin at $200k. Now if we have 1 billion people putting $5000 on average into Bitcoin, we are at $1m a Bitcoin.\n  \nAnd thats just for private people without all the institutional investors. For them actually ESG is still an issue, that looks like it will be fixed by Bitcoin over time, so that you have to add on top of these calculations. \n  \nWe would probably need to start to think in Satoshis at some point in the future. Because people would rather own 10,000 Satoshis over 0.00010000 Bitcoin (even tho its the same thing).",

It opens Bitcoin up to what I would call Bitcoin Rule Laundering:\n\n1. A wealthy institution or government collects a lot of Bitcoin from a lot of people via a cash flow business or tax model.\n2. When they spend that Bitcoin back into the economy they attach rules to it to restrict who can receive it.\n3. More and more Bitcoin becomes captured by centralized monetary policy rules.\n\nUltimately I think we can put limits to the permanence of these covenants or whatever they're called such that these problems aren't really an issue... but it definitely needs to simmer in debate for a couple years.",
