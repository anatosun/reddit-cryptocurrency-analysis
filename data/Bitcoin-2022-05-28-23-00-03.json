They said it again in the 80s. In the 1990s they introduced debit cards with the expressed intention of \"breaking everyone of the habit of using cash\", in preparation for a cashless future. \n\nThe problem is you'd have to be old enough to remember this stuff. \n\nThen bitcoin comes out, with a fairy tail origin story and all the \"smart people\" dont even question it, but sure do like to mouth off. \n\nIt was touted as totally anonymous in the early days and it's not. Every transaction stored in the blockchain. \n\nIt's been touted as decentralized and it's not. Its centralized around government controlled computer networks called the internet. \n\nThe explosion in prices made a few people rich, but gave people the bug for it. The point being to drive the general acceptance of cryptos and that is what is important. It's also why you dont see anyone even talking about using it for purchase anymore. They know the next step is about to take place.\n\nA regional or nation state version has always been the plan. They want the ability to tax, track and regulate every purchase you make. Plus the added ability to turn your access off, if you act up or get out of line.\n\nCryptos themselves are the honeypot and they're using your greed to normalize the move.\n\nThis is what is happening and you're participating in it.

In the 1990s they introduced debit cards with the express intention of breaking everyone of the habbit of using cash, in preparation for a cashless future. \n\nThe problem is you'd have to be old enough to remember this stuff.\n\nThen bitcoin comes out, with a fairy tail origin story and all the \"smart people\" dont even question it, but sure do like to mouth off. It was touted as totally anonymous in the early days and it's not. Every transaction stored in the blockchain. It's been touted as decentralized and it's not. Its centralized around government controlled computer networks called the internet to function. \n\nThe explosion in prices made a few people rich, but gave people the bug for it. The point being to drive the general acceptance of cryptos and that is what is important. It's also why you dont see anyone even talking about using it for purchase anymore. They know the next step is about to take place.\n\nYou will soon find out who is behind it. Nation state versions have always been the plan. They want the ability to tax, track and regulate every purchase you make. Plus the added ability to turn your access off, if you act up or get out of line.\n\nCryptos are the honeypot.",
