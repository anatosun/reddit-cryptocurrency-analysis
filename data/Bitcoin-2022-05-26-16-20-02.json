But they're not mutually dependent or strictly correlated, since for example more miners could start mining in geographies with cheaper electricity (sometimes seasonal), increasing the hashrate even if the price is too low to be profitable in others.",

I have an interesting thought experiment that I haven\u2019t been able to find a solution to, and was wondering what the communities views are. Basically given Bitcoin\u2019s halving schedule and the current centralized nature of BTC mining, even if the price/coin significantly accretes in value, won\u2019t it be in the best interest of miners to short the coin and run a 51% attack so it quickly loses value?\n\nBitcoin near-term halving schedule:\n2024: 3.125 block rewards\n2028: 1.5625 block rewards\n2032: 0.78125 block rewards\n2036: 0.390626 block rewards\n2040: 0.1953125 block rewards\n\nCurrent Hashpower Distribution (from BTC.com)\n1. Foundry USA: 24.2%\n2. Antpool: 14.5%\n3. F2Pool: 13.3%\n4. ViaBTC: 10.9%\n5. Poolin: 9.4%\n6. Remaining top 8 miners: 27.8%\n\nSo in 2036, with mining rewards of less than half a coin, and an assumed price of $250k (prob on the low end), wouldn\u2019t it be in those miners best interest to group together, short the coin and attack the network? They\u2019d stand to make 100\u2019s of millions fairly quickly. Am I missing something?",
