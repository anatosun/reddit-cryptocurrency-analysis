And generally I would disagree with that opinion due to the nature of being locked into the central bank fist system. But the entire fiat system runs off debt and false figures so having ownership of others debts is the more preferable ownership of debt. But i digress. My goal is to get away from all of it, and actually outright own the land and buildings on the properties I purchase so cash flow goes straight into covering overhead costs and increase overall incoming cash flow. To actually allow for affordable leasing and rent.",
