            "selftext": "So, I just started getting involved in cryptocurrency when the market crash occurred (buy low, sell high), and I learned that there is an option to get interest for certain coins that I have invested into. However, it requires the last four digits of your social security number (SSN). I have inputted the correct last four digits of my SSN as well as my correct name and home address. However, Coinbase says that my identity could not be verified. I have talked to an agent on customer service, in which there was nothing that they did. Once I completely explained my problem, he just ended the chat room. I tried to look up the problem on Google, but with no results. Is there anything I can do or am I SOL?",

It takes a few days to a couple weeks to actually be verified after the KYC stuff is sent.\n\nI am guessing that you have completed the necessary KYC, and it is checked off as sent on your page, but it is indeed not actually verified by Coinbase; (I believe) actual eyes need to review the material.",
