Rather, to the L1, L2s are just smart contracts on the L1 with people publishing for you a condensed summary of transactions that happen on the L2.\n\nAs such, the L2 can ensure in its smart contract that there are functions you can call so that you can withdraw your funds from it yourself, even if the L2 network stops working (like, if they're being coerced and censored or similar events).\n\nThough, you'd also need to be aware that, as L2s are still in development, most of them are still being upgradable. This means there's a vulnerability where the contract can be changed to remove (or worse) such functions normally letting you withdraw your funds.\n\nThat's why it's important to see the risks associated with each specific L2 before joining.",
