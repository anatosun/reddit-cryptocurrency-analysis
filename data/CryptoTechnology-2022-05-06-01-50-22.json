E.g., you're not allowed to recall your asset before 30 days.\n\nI think this would be a service that would have demand. SafeMoon HODLers could collect interest on their asset which they're apparently planning to hold for years. The rest of /r/cc could short the asset.\n\nWhat am I missing?",

What is better in this case, to make a token on the binance chain or the ethereum chain?\n\nWhat are the benefits of either?\n\nI\u2019m hoping to either post it on Uniswap or Pancake swap. I do want people to make money on it, and be a force for good. \n\nHow many total tokens should be there? And how many decimal points? What are the basic criteria you look for when buying a token, and how can I earn your trust?\n\nSince I\u2019m a little bit poor, I am looking for the most effective and the cheapest way to publish it on the blockchain, I heard ethereum has high gas fees.\n\nSo fellow people of the crypto world,\n\nPlease help?",
