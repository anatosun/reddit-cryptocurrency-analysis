And if they had read what the sub said, there were plenty of posts warning that there'd likely be a sell-off happening. \n\n2) If you're negative 30k, you clearly invested more on a single yolo-buy than you were willing or ready to lose, showing yet again, that you ignored the most common advice given in crypto communities.\n\n3) We are currently going through the worst economic times in recorded history. There is no price-target that anyone looks for until this is over. The markets are highly overleveraged, manipulated and has been smashed to the ground by the actions of the FED. \n\nThere are only 3 options. Sell at a loss and live with it. Hodl through it and wait for gains after it is over. Try to swing-trade the markets to make a profit off the volatility.\n\nThe first is a guaranteed loss. The second a guaranteed win. The third whatever you make of it... \n\nYou do not need any hope, you only need understanding for what is happening in the market and a strategy to handle it. Hope is for people who have no idea what they are doing.",
