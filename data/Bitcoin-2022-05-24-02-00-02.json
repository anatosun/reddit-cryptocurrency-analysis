Send Bitcoin to employees' wallets. It's easier than PayPal, and much easier than international banking transfers  \n\nRemember there's no such animal as $500 of Bitcoin. Each payment must be an agreed Bitcoin amount before you send it. As they employer, you have the option to unilaterally decide what Bitcoin amount to pay, but for the sake of good employee relations, you should show your calculation method\n\n> Then is there a way for the employees to easily receive the crypto\n\nBitcoin wallets do not know international borders\n\n> and exchange it to their local currencies?\n\nVery often, not. This varies hugely from country to country",
