Its saying I have to wait for a bank transfer to clear.  Thats never been issue before. Its always let me withdraw right away. \n\nEither coinbase has become very glitchy or they have changed policies since losing 40 million users and a $430 million net loss.\n\nIt won't let me use usdc on the card either until the bank transfer clears.. It's always let me use usdc on the card instantly. My card has been declined multiple times even though there's plenty of usdc on there.",
