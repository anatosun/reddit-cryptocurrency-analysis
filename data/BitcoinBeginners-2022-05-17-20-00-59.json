Never send Bitcoin directly from a regulated exchange to a DNM. The absolute minimum you need to do is create a single hop and withdraw the full amount to a private wallet , and than send the full amount to the DNM. For illegal drugs you should coinjoin or use a feature like ricochet as a much better option \n\nhttps://samouraiwallet.com/ is easy way to do this for small amounts \n\nOr use joinmarket or wasabi",

Since they did not send the transaction in the first place they have no control of the tx so whether or not the tx is confirmed or not is moot and coinbase will not try and doublespend any of their 0confs regardless.",
