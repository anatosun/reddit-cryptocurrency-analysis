            "selftext": "So, if you will ever store your mnemonic key in a physical paper. I suggest to use this technique. Download an offline QR code generator (I use one from softpedia). Convert each word into a png file which you will then import into a word file table as follows. So what's the idea behind this? Why not just write each word instead? So, each day you check for your paper wallet, if it's in place then you're safe but what if it's stolen? Then you will need to have more time to transfer the funds from your wallet to another one. Storing the words in QR codes guarantees that it's not human readable, the thief must qr code scan each word to be able to unlock the wallet. This should give you some time ahead to transfer the funds (in case you are still alive). Of course I am assuming that the paper is not the only way you store your keys and you have a backup in an ecnrypted password cloud storage service.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/go0cyf7i0ot81.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=73f9fd338d5cf2ef0c65a99a32452e61ca0d3092",

In my critique, I basically argue that the 1MB block size cap in BTC makes it a terrible reserve asset for free banking, because the block size cap makes it virtually impossible for consumers to execute a \"bank run\" on a Bitcoin bank.\n\nI haven't seen this point argued anywhere else. Before I start pushing it more broadly, I wanted to post it here and ask for feedback. Is my logic sound? Or am I missing something?\n\nAnyone interested in Austrian economics will hopefully find the article interesting, whether or not you agree.

In fact I doubt I can find it but I remember reading a Gmax argument a long time ago in which he very clearly pointed out that the block size limit reduces the ability to conduct a bank run (in the context of that being a good thing).  It didn't feel right when I read it but it didn't occur to me until now why that's a bad thing.  After many years I now understand the counterargument.  It will take a while to assimilate it into my thinking, because it is indeed critical. \n\nAlso your handy treatment of LN is extremely salient.  If in fact Bitcoin BTC becomes the world standard settlement system then it becomes prohibitive for almost anyone to run an LN wallet trustlessly.  And even if you could run a trustless wallet, who would you be connecting to and routing through?  *The banking system.*\n\nThanks so much for this.\n\n/u/chaintip",

I understand why you would not want to write \"Bitcoin (BTC)\" in every place where you make this statement in this article, but it would be more correct because the general statement is unproven and Bitcoin (Cash) or some other Bitcoin derived coin might well prove it wrong in future.\n\n__The article is good, but swallowing the small blockers' main premise without labeling it as a hypothesis (or axiom in their case) makes the argument presented against the Bitcoin Standard here seem incomplete to me.__ It could even be just a footnote indicating that this claim against on chain scalability of the protocol is still in dispute.\n\nI'm not even going to cite Satoshi's view on the scalability of the base protocol, they're well known to everyone ;-)\n\nBut let's look at the minimum of 1B people doing 1 cash transactions each per day at ~220b/tx, that requires ~1.5Gb blocks. It's not out of the realm of the possible, quite the contrary. People have run [1GB Bitcoin Cash blocks](https://read.cash/@mtrycz/how-my-rpi4-handles-mining-1gb-blocks-e5d09d83) on a Raspberry Pi on the scaling testnet, not even commodity desktop PC much less server level hardware. Another Bitcoin-derived blockchain has run multi-GB blocks albeit I would not lend my full credence to their methodology as being representative of cash transactions on an open Bitcoin network.\n\nMy point is : blocks of a couple GB are not out of reach by any means. That would accomodate billions of people doing a single tx per day, and strictly speaking, would cover what your article currently claims is not achievable.",

As you said, the market is becoming more complex, meaning that e.g. a power outage in Kazakhstan is resulting to a sharp drop of the crypto prices which is incredibly difficult to forecast. \n\nUsually, the more a market is complex, the harder it is to manipulate it because there are too many factors involved in the price evaluation.\n\n\"Market manipulation can be difficult not only for authorities but also   \nfor the manipulator. These difficulties are exacerbated by the increase   \nin the size of the market and the number of participants in it.\"\n\nSource: https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/market-manipulation/\n\nAlso, don't forget that my main idea was just that a massive adoption will likely help small investors to purchase bitcoin without the use of the exchange platforms as it is easier to find a 2nd party for an exchange, and thus avoid a centralized 3rd party.

That is a matter that is more and more concerning people.\n\nThis is more of these annoying pro-crypto marketing cliches.   You speak of \"de-centralization\" as if it's some kind of solution... to what?   It's just a characteristic. Whether that characteristic has value has yet to be realized.  I've already gone into great detail [all the claims made by blockchain that are false](https://reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/comments/lq6xpq/the_defacto_list_of_cryptocurrencyblockchain/).  We are 13 years into \"de-centralized money\" and there's not a single advantage it offers... except you think if it's less \"centralized\" that's a thing.  Nobody really has any idea what that even means. It's just a buzzword.  Crypto is and always will be a combination of centralization and de-centralization, just like the Internet itself; just like the US government, just like a lot of things.  \n\nIt's really infuriating to hear people use the word \"de-centralized\" like it has specific meaning and purpose.  It does not.  It's just a distraction.  \"Hey bro, this thing is de-centralized!   That means it's awesome.  Don't ask me specifics though...\"\n\n>There are issues with the blockchain technology, but this is an open source software that is gaining maturity with time.\n\nYea, I remember when microwave ovens came out.  People said, \"Right now this doesn't cook food any faster, but we're only 13 years into this tech... buy a microwave and wait 18 months and it will get better.\"\n\n/cringe",

That would mean the instant destruction of this open source software. It is imperative that the accesses for changing the Bitcoin Core is limited in order to avoid security breaches.\n\nAs said in the bitcointalk source that yourself provided in your message, the people that were granted access are frequent contributors that achieved to propose contributions to enhance the project.\n\nWe can discuss wether these contributions are linked to the enhancement of the blockchain functionality or pure speculation, it is important to remember that all these changes are not made by someone without any discussion, it is made following discussion with the bitcoin community.\n\nIf one of these person makes a change without the consentment of the community, you can be sure that this person won't be trusted anymore and would like lose his access. These people are more like representative executers of the modifications that are adopted by the bitcoin community.\n\nThe granted access to some of these people were revoked (e.g. Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik), which is an argument showing that no, saying that only 6 people are able to change Bitcoin Core is an extrem simplification of the reality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) About the efficiency of the blockchain technology, of course bitcoin is an unefficient blockchain that leads to wasted energy, that's an issue that was already emphasized years ago. \n\nBut there are plenty of other blockchains that are meant to be way more efficient that the biggest financial system in the world (Western Union, Visa, MasterCard, etc.).

Aaaand... the solution was to revise Basel II which failed.\n\nWho is responsible of that failure ?\n\nThis is the key item that pushed cyberpunks to definitely find a solution to create a financial system that doesn't need a 3rd party.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"With de-centralization, if something goes wrong, there's not usually anybody to blame.\n\nIf something goes wrong in a centralized system, you're not sure that the centralized party will take the responsability of the issue.\n\nA good example is the insurance system where in fact you usually need to prove that the issue is not coming from the vendor/buyer but from the third part as the third party has no financial interest to cover something wrong if they can prove it's not their responsability.\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, bitcoin system did not show any failure since 2008.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In this scenario, the term \"trustless\" is inaccurate.

Is this the fault of a 3rd party if your house got smashed by a fortuitous event ? Who's held accountable ?\n\nThat's the same with our current financial system. If a disaster destroys the database center and all the backups and that we lose all the money. Who's responsible ? Who will refund you ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In each of these systems there is a level of implied \"trust\" - whetheryou choose to trust in a central (accountable) authority of blindlytrust \"code\", it's still trust.\n\nIt's different because in this case it is an open source code that any individual can choose to audit and make their own choice.\n\nFeel free to avoid it if following your audit you cannot trust this code.\n\nOtherwise, fine, use it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You're making my case -- that central authorities, like the 3 people whoare in charge of the main bitcoin repository, are more trustworthythan, as you say \"allowing anybody to modify the project code.\"\n\nNot at all.\n\nIn your case there is a central authority (moral entity) that is following his own goals and making its own rules that could differ from the users. If they are making mistakes, who will run an audit about this mistake ? Who will be held responsible ?\n\nThe financial crisis of 2008 is again a good example (sorry to repeat it, but it's the core reason of the creation of blockchain).\n\nIn the case of the blockchain and in this example the case of bitcoin, the goal of the users is to make the best blockchain system possible as usually they are investors in bitcoins (yes I recognize there's an obvious financial link).\n\nBut the transparency is way more present than in the centralized systems since it's an open source software where any individual can contribute freely. Moreover, you get an open source history of ALL the transactions of the currency without any possibility to hide anything, allowing any individual to make his own audit freely.\n\nSo in my sense, yes, the decentralized system of bitcoin is way more trustless than the centralized one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Again, you make vague claims that are incapable of being tested true orfalse.  It's impossible to debate someone making such dishonest,misleading claims.\n\nThis is still purely theoretical due to the scability aspect, but it's like the Schr\u00f6dinger cat:\n\nIt's working and not working because we need to test it to really prove if it's more efficient or not. From a theorical aspect, it is, from a practical aspect, we need to run tests on a bigger sample which is needing a world adoption.",

That happened yesterday.\n\nYour claims that multiple checkers are better than centralized authority doesn't seem to be backed up by real life, real world stuff that happens.\n\nAND, because this happened on the \"immutable blockchain\" the remaining bagholders are now begging to have the blockchain fork and un-do the botched transaction.  Also proving that blockchain is not immutable.\n\nThis whole industry is like a giant clown car.  It's like as soon as you say something is stable, it explodes in your face.\n\n>The financial crisis of 2008 is again a good example (sorry to repeat it, but it's the core reason of the creation of blockchain).\n\nThe financial crisis of 2008 is a good example all right.  It was [directly caused by de-regulation of the banking industry](http://bsalert.com/news/2416/What_Caused_The_Second_Depression_In-A-Nutshell.html) - specifically the rollback of Glass-Steagall which prohibited banks from engaging in risky securities ventures.  The crypto industry is almost a carbon copy of the same kind of Ponzi-like scheme the banks deployed which directly led to the 2008 collapse of the housing market.\n\nLuckily unlike the 2008 crisis, very few traditional institutions are that exposed in crypto.  When crypto crashes a bunch of neckbeards will cry like babies, but our economy won't flinch, because still... most people don't care about crypto and are not exposed to it's incredibly risky schemes.",

TrustLESS refers to not requiring trust, not how much you can trust it.  That's the whole point is that you shouldn't have to decide how much you trust someone to pass along your money, you should be able to tell them to do it, and there isn't any option for them to do it, whether you trust them or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoney-wise, the guy you trust may not be the guy I trust, and the guy you trusted yesterday might not be the guy you trust today.  TrustLESS means you can click a button and even someone with a hidden agenda or long running grudge against you can't pull one over on you...or even more importantly someone can't build up a trustWORTHY looking service for a year and wait until enough people trust him and then run off with the money, or start working with the government.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly your comment means you're either deceptively trying to sway people with mixing up similar looking words, or you don't understand that concept enough to have a good argument to continue.  If, on the other hand, you literally didn't understand the difference between those concepts, but were curious about it and would like to have a real conversation about it, I would love to continue and at least debate crypto with you on an honest basis.  You do have good points on some of the peripheral concepts, people are trying to use the term 'blockchain' as some magic, ridiculous marketing attempt, coins are being built strictly as scams with no real utility, bitcoin is certainly being compromised and being presented as solutions to problems no one has, but trustless and decentralized are not \\*always\\* buzzwords, there's an actual use... maybe it won't be bitcoin that ultimately takes over the world, but the first thing that does successfully mavrry those two things will be.",

And of course in some cases, thinking the purpose of Bitcoin is number go up in fiat money terms.\n\nThe effective psyop is making people believe that _that_ is using Bitcoin. \"Muh store of value\", \"muh digital gold\", \"muh exchange tokens\".\n\n---\n\nI must point out that in all of the above, the usage of the word 'scam' is far too loose, it's basically pop culture in the cryptosphere, but these are not scams in a stricter sense and a lot of people actually disapprove of applying the term 'scam' too loosely.

Just because bitcoin is being used by scammy people, or in scammy ways, as long as Coinbase or others as a bank isn't a requirement they are really little more than conveniences.  Yes they are a bad direction, but they have very little to do with the technology themselves.  Just like if i offered to hold your paper wallets for you in a pile in my backyard, just because that's a stupid way to keep track of your bitcoin, it doesn't make bitcoin itself any less secure or 'non-scammy'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople like this, that actually have a reasonable grasp of the technology, generalizing things like this can cause more issues than any actual challenge the technology has in front of it.",

It was never created as an \"investment.\"\n\nBut more importantly, the whole act of measuring the value of bitcoin in *fiat* undermines the whole purpose of bitcoin.  And these exchanges engage in so much market manipulation, there's no way to tell what the real price is.  There's $160 Billion worth of USDT and USDC floating around pumping everything up.  And crypto people are happy to stick their heads in the sand as long as they think they can profit.  What they don't realize is, they lost the moment they bought and HODL'd.",

Either a newcomer (to flipstarter) or a regular undercover. And 2 projects/companies: satoshidice has contributed to infrastructure before and is continuing. Tangoswap chimes in (i think they did before, but not sure)\n\nAdd in the fact that the Verde fs had a lot of contributors (enabled by the minimum amount problem having been solved).\n\nRemember when they said \"voluntary funding is not sustainable\"? How long have we been doing this now? 2 years plus? \n\nWe said whales and big fish would fund projects to protect their investments and add value. It happened.\n\nWe said companies would jump in to support their market and increase reputation. It's happening!\n\nI'm really happy. Thanks to everyone contributing to this flipstarter and all the others.",
