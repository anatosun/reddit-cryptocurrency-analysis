If there is no one that wants to do that then the SmartBCH project will die but that means it would die from lack of interest anyway. \n\nAlso, I'm not sure why this RATHER IMPORTANT point is being ignored, but its NOT ACTUALLY POSSIBLE. As far as I know, the impossible hurdle is that you need to run an Ethereum node within a Bitcoin transaction. Maybe someday but again, not anytime soon. I've even seen dudes here say they are going to wait to use SmartBCH until there is a DEX bridge, dude is going to be waiting a long time, lol. \n\nI feel this idea of a decentralized exchange keeps coming up from people that have NO CONCEPT of how Bitcoin works, let alone Ethereum and cross chain swamps. Bottom line, ITS NOT GONNA HAPPEN, at least not anytime soon.",

It does bot need to check the ETH blockchain.\n\n1 Smart BCH would be issued for each BCH locked in the mainchain contract so SBCH nodes also need to run BCH full nodes. Miners need to run Smart BCH nodes if they want to correctly vote on the withdrawals from the covenant. These withdrawals represent SBCH being burned on the sidechain and being released back on the mainchain.\n\nI already upgraded the SHA-gate smart contact, you should read up on the Bitcoin Cash Research forum\nhttps://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/will-sha-gate-be-ready-for-the-may-15th-upgrade/735",
