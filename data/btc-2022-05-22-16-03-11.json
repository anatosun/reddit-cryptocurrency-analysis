All markets are inefficient and there are always a small percentage of insiders that know a hell of a lot more of what is going on behind the scenes than others.  For the non-insiders (all of us) we have to watch what is going on and try to interpret it.  So look at the situation from someone clueless.  In a short amount of time, people have wanted to get their assets out of tether to the tune of $9b or 1/7 of their entire market.  A very reasonable explanation is that these people are insiders want to grab the only viable assets backing the tether instead of being left holding redemptive coupons to a bankrupt project.  There are other, very reasonable, explanations of course, but when there is as little transparency in a project as there is with tether, you stay safe by assuming the worst.  \n\n\nAnother troubling thing about the situation is that people of honor put up where as liars can't seem to shut the fuck up about excuses because it makes them think they are being productive.  In my view tether can't seem to shut the fuck up about all the things they aren't able to do.\n\nI don't want tether to fail because I don't want the instability and extra regulation that event would produce.  That said, I have a project that requires a stable value token and I am not even considering using tether.  Or I should say I did consider it and said no.",
