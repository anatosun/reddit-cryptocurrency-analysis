When I read this  piece of information I could barely believe it, I  had to double check it.  \n\n\nDoes it surprise you as much as it has surprised me or was I just living in a fantasy all these years. ?  \n\n\nI believe I have a realistic view of the world but it seems I don't quite understand how poor  and unconnected some parts of the world are.  \n\n\nI make money from crypto, and pretty much everything else I do is in some way shape or form connected to the Internet and made possible by it. So many people including myself have benefited from it and I believe that it could change lives of people indefinetely  if they had the level of connectivity and knowledge that the internet provides.  \n\n\nDo you think it would improve our whole civilization if more companies started paying attention and investing in causes like these in remote parts of the world ? Because blockchain tech with it's sustainability and ability to improve any sector can bring about change by bringing a piece of the modern world to our globes most remote parts.  \n\n\nNow I have heard of a couple of companies like (World Mobile Token, Giant, Telcoin) that already implement blockchain as a foundation of their efforts to bring telekoms to the underdeveloped parts of the world but I believe that more companies like these are needed to make true change possible.  \n\n\nDo you share my sentiments and have you heard of any other projects that focus on benefiting these regions of the world.",
