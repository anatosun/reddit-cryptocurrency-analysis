Currently, our token is used primarily for governance purposes. Along with voting in Index Coop proposals, the $INDEX token accumulates metagovernance voting rights within other DeFi protocols. For example, since DPI holds tokens in the underlying protocols, like AAVE and Uniswap, $INDEX token holders have the opportunity to be a [positive-sum participant in those protocols\u2019 governance](https://indexcoop.com/blog/metagovernance-index-coop). \n\nThe ability to start contributing to a project I believe in and begin earning $INDEX as a part-time was one of the most attractive aspects of joining Index Cooperative and holding $INDEX. I found it motivating to have partial ownership of the project and the right to vote on proposals that can have a positive impact on the future of Index Coop and other DeFi protocols.\n\nAs Index Coop has matured, we\u2019ve tried to find ways to incentivize and reward contributors who\u2019ve consistently provided value to the organization. Since we build, launch, and grow crypto-native structured products, a well-coordinated effort is needed to pull that off. In order to ensure the long-term success of our organization, there is a need to offer [compensation packages to secure talent and provide a foundation for the future](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-128-priority-hiring-round-1/3707). \n\nAs you mention, a large supply of cheap tokens could have a detrimental effect on the direction and security of the DAO.

If I understand you correctly, you still have lots of ideas you'd want to implement and you'd want to keep the control until you're done implementing them. Many DAOs choose to do so and it's clearly reasonable. \n\nThough, you may want to add some kind of disclaimer or anything to ensure people know that it's not yet an actual DAO, as it's not autonomous or decentralized, yet, but that you're planning on releasing control once you're done.\n\nOtherwise, some people will end up spotting the gap between your claims and reality and, depending on when they spot it, they may feel it's a red flag or even that they've been betrayed. There's no need to antagonize people like that. \n\nOn top of that, being forward and transparent regarding this topic can be seen as very mature and responsible. I've only seen a few projects admitting on their temporary pitfalls and that they're planning to solve them, simply that solving them needs to be prioritized against other tasks.\n\nI may also have misunderstood what you've said.

[Odyssey DAO](https://www.odysseydao.com/) is a great spot for those getting started. Once you've got the basics, it's about finding projects that you think are valuable and align with your interests.\n\nMost protocols will have a Discord, documentation, a governance form, and social channels that will provide an opportunity for you to make contact. Lurk for a while, ask questions and when you feel like you've got a handle, don't be afraid to help. Most crypto projects and protocols are biased towards action and self-starters.\n\nOnce you've found a project or two that piques your interest, it's about finding the intersection of your skills/ability with the needs of that project. No two paths are the same but by being an active member in the community of your favorite protocols/projects, you stand a good chance of learning when a potential opportunity comes along.",
