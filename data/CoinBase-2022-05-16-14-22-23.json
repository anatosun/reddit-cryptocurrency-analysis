Today I sent crypto from Metamask to Coinbase, hoping to sell into GBP and withdraw. Unfortunately it's only showing the EURO option - although everything is in GBP in my Coinbase account.\n\nOf course I cannot transfer EUROs to a UK account and would rather not go through the trouble of opening a Revolut account. Please help. I have contacted Coinbase and to be honest the customer service is just!!!!",

You can find more information on getting your local currency here: https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/add-a-payment-method/how-do-i-use-my-local-currency-wallet-usd-eur-gbp\n\nIf you'd like to get GBP you need to reside in the UK and also upload an identification document issued in your state or country of residence.\n\nLet us know if you need anything else.",
