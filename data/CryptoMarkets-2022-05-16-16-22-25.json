Here is the link: http://dex-cex.app\n and I have been letting the arbitrage trading bots work there magic and bring me 1.2-1.7% for the past couple of days. Idk if it\u2019s a scam or rug pull or what? Has anyone used these arbitrage bots from this website on their coinbase wallet before? I\u2019m really sketched out and don\u2019t know what to do thanks!",
