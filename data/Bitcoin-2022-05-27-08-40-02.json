I hope posts like this are allowed, I'm sorry if it's not. \n\nAs the title states, I've been working full-time for about 4 months to make my own version of a crypto managing app since I really needed one, and the ones I've found were really limited or with a subscription fee.\n\nSo I've made mine completely from scratch. It's available as web application and mobile application on the Play Store. \n\nThe application is completely free and 100% open source. It retrieves data every second from Binance and calculates and display data regarding your investments. To use it, you need to create an account and record your transactions, then go to the dashboard page to see all the statistics. \n\nLet me know what you think and what can be improved! I'm open to all kinds of constructive feedback and suggestions. I hope this app can help you as well!\n\nHere are the links: \n\n[https://wwwallet.app](https://wwwallet.app)\n\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wwwallet.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wwwallet.app)",
