I managed to get about 3.5K coins before I got bored lol, which was like 25 cents back then. I did it with the intention of using doge as a currency, not as an investment or gamble. So yeah, I'm up quite a bit, but I'm not planning on \"selling\", it's just cool that it got to a point where I CAN use it to buy/sell stuff, it's just hard to find people that do it. So there's no end goal, just using doge as doge. I've been buying more this past month. 1D=1D baby!",
