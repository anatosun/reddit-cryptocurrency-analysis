You're not buying a 1:1 stake of the BTC. So when the demand for shares decreases and GBTC doesn't sell the equivalent BTC out of the Trust, there is a disparity. Currently the disparity represents a discount. The BTC equivalent of the shares you own is higher. So you're getting more exposure to BTC for less.",

                    "response": "TL;DR: **GBTC has a one-way peg with BTC. This one-way peg makes it difficult to maintain a premium, but easy to maintain a discount.**\n\nThe peg works like this:\n\nOther than trading shares in the market, investors can also obtain shares directly by depositing bitcoins into the trust. This becomes an arbitrage opportunity when there is a premium. An investor can deposit bitcoins to obtain newly issued shares and then turn around and sell the shares for a premium.\n\nFor example, if the price of a bitcoin is $30k and the share premium is 10%, then an investor could deposit 1 BTC and receive shares in the trust that are worth $33k (because of the premium). The shares can be sold and the money used to buy 1.1 BTC.\n\nNote that the increasing supply of shares due to new shares being issued causes the premium to fall.\n\nNow, here is the important point -- the shares of the trust cannot be redeemed for the bitcoins in the trust. It is a one-way peg.\n\nIf the shares could be redeemed for bitcoins, then an investor could buy shares at a discount and redeem them for the full amount of bitcoins.\n\nFor example, if the price of a bitcoin is $30k and the share discount is 30%, and shares could be redeemed, then an investor could buy $21k worth of shares and redeem them for BTC worth $30k (because of the discount).\n\nThe reduced supply of shares due to the redemption would cause the discount to fall. However, because this redemption is not possible, the discount remains.\n\nTurning GBTC into an ETF would allow a two-way peg that would keep the premium or discount close to 0.",
