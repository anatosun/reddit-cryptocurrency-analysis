[Bitcoin is a peer to peer internet payment network.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network#:~:text=The%20bitcoin%20network%20is%20a,using%20bitcoin%20cryptocurrency%20wallet%20software)\n\nProofs the internet was invented to survive a nuclear holocaust:\n\nhttps://www.wired.co.uk/article/h-bomb-and-the-internet\n\nhttps://www.rand.org/about/history/baran.html\n\n**\u20bf**[itcoin nodes and miners are literally in nuclear bunkers today and have been in them for some years now](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasperhamill/2013/11/05/this-swiss-cryptocurrency-trader-will-store-your-bitcoin-in-a-nuclear-bunker/).\n\nHell, [we even have them in space thanks to blockstream\u2019s satellites](https://blockstream.com/satellite/#:~:text=Blockstream%20Satellite%20broadcasts%20the%20Bitcoin,an%20opportunity%20to%20use%20Bitcoin.). \n\nSo if nuclear war breaks out, don\u2019t worry about internet networks like Bitcoin, instead worry about how you\u2019ll survive it so you can still be alive to access and use your Bitcoin during and after it.\n\nAlso, a little story for everyone to consider. In 1997 my dad had $40k worth of Microsoft and other tech stocks. He panic sold it for $20k after uncle Sam took the other half of it with their short term capital gains tax cut of the profit. He did that because of this \u201cscary event\u201d that was supposed to happen called \u201cY2K\u201d. That $40k worth of tech stocks would be worth $2.7 million today. \n\nWould\u2019ve been enough for me and my siblings to afford college. Enough to live off the interest with 6 figures a year. \nInstead, he panic sold it to the same rich people who were pushing the Y2K story, all so they could scare him into selling his blue chip tech stocks to them for way cheaper than they expected the stocks would be worth in the future. \nWhich they were right about, because I run those numbers in my head every day, and for more than half a decade now remembering that story has allowed me to HODL into life changing stacks, instead of panic selling like so many of my friends and family did who started this journey with me, but panic FUDed out after a tiny bit of fud they saw which was funded by the same people buying their Bitcoin from them for cheap, just like my dad who panic sold his life changing tech stocks for cheap to the same people pushing the Y2K narrative",

The EO combines a multitude of regulatory agencies set to define regulatory practices throughout a public process based on feedback from stakeholders. The order also initiates the creation of a workforce pathway for those hoping to enter the cryptocurrency space.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Effectively Miners and Developers would be given a greater possibility to collude with each other while node operators are left out. Why? Because its a speedy trial (like taproot was) as opposed to USAF (user activated soft fork) And the implementation of a MASF (Miner activated soft fork)  \nProponents of BIP-119 will argue that MASF mimimizes risk of consensus failure in cooperative scenario while UASF incentivizes cooperation in adversarial scenario.  \nHowever, this method of consensus is flawed. Introducing new changes to a soft fork via Miner Signaling shift consensus towards the miners and devs and away from pleb Node operators. You wont be able to \u201cvote with your node\u201d so to speak because it\u2019s a speedy trial. The Devs asked the Miners and the Miners agreed. From that point they see no need for UASF.  \nBitcoin should not adopt a culture of rapidly accepting more features nobody was asking for. This is the the wish of just a few people. Not all. One Developer made the initial proposal.  \nThe big red flag is how fast and aggressively this is trying to be pushed out while changing the consensus methods. After Taproot and it\u2019s speedy trial, some people did realise that this consensus method might not be good for the future of the network.  \nThere is NO urgency or problem that needs to be solved by this or in this manner. If you can point one out please do so.  \nUpdates to the code should be for efficiency and security of the network. Not adding complexity.  \nSpeedy Trial is an attack Vector  \nAny soft fork activated via Bitcoin Core is an attack vector  \nTomer Strolight writes: \u201cThis is a crucial point to understand. Anyone giving miners an activation path in Bitcoin Core that excludes users is taking control of Bitcoin. Doesn't matter if they're doing it for safety or ease. It's better to risk a bumpy activation than exclude users in consensus changes.\u201d  \nThat\u2019s my 2c. Flame away.",

I wrote to their support and here is their reply - \" in the light of the current events in Ukraine and the consequent regulatory directives, we\u2019ve been required to disable your account\u2019s deposit, trading and withdrawal options\"\n\nI asked for an official notice that all Russian citizens should be blocked, without the possibility of withdrawal.\n\nI am a simple person, not connected in any way and not supporting the war in Ukraine. I created an account in 2019, verified it, confirmed the legal origin of the funds.\n\nAnd now the exchange just wants to appropriate my money, referring to what is happening in Ukraine.\n\n[u/BitStampOfficial](https://www.reddit.com/u/BitStampOfficial/) I ask you to provide legal notice on what basis you completely blocked my account, as well as many other accounts from Russia.\n\nWhy is no other exchange taking measures like yours?? Two weeks later, your support team cannot give me an answer, but is just playing for time. **TICKET #BIT-1438832**\n\nI really hope that you are mistaken and the reliability of the oldest European stock exchange is beyond doubt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nkj7hoefmjx81.jpg?width=1580&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8059f5d04b1912fb2709cd586cfff2c814c05c0",

That is the childish stupidity of the West, a toddler would understand the fallacy. In Canada they even approved seizing funds of Russian INDIVIDUALS living in Canada and guilty of no crime. This is Trudeau's version of freedom, and his loyal lapdog Jagmeet Singh and gleeful henchwoman Chrystia Freeland. Looks like Bitstamp got right on board, maybe it helps balance their fractional reserve to support the \"sanctions\". Americans and Canadians by and large support this shit.

I would say 60% of his business was only MDMA/XTC, which he got dirt cheap.  The other 40% of product was probably stuff he procured,  a notch or two down the ladder so at lower profit margins, and later sold in personal amounts.  $3 million isn\u2019t a lot when it comes to high level drug dealers.
