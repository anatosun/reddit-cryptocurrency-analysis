Fractional reserve/paper bitcoin. The idea that bitcoin will become the optimal a store of value when it can be diluted by powerful entities is nonsensical. Not your keys not your bitcoin does not work for the majority of people, when you trust third parties in all probability they are going to abuse their power and run fractional reserve scam. Do I have some insider knowledge that it is in fact happening? No, but it is naive to assume that it isn't. This is the Achilles' heel of bitcoin as store of value thesis. \n\nBitcoin is a currency of the internet, that is why it was invented and how it should be used, not as some kind of a collectible you HODL in cold storage, it cannot function as a collectible because there is too much of it and the \u201cimaginary supply\u201d can be diluted, the imaginary supply defines the price.  \n\nThey can always print more imaginary bitcoin, and there is nothing we can do about it.

WTF do we need this for?\n\nTheir awareness will increase, their curiosity will lead to learning, and the timing will be perfect because Bitcoin, Lightning, Strike, and other consumer oriented services will be maturing and allow BTC to become more accessible and the on ramp will be easier. \n\nIt\u2019s just a question of when.",

I find it astonishing that people dont see how incredibly hard it is to change behaviour of any adult animal. Anyone who ever had or trained animals know that very young have incredible neuro plasticity, but at some point the difficulty of inflicting new behavioral changes increase with age exponentially. It is very hard to actually change your own behaviour using your own will once you are after ~25. It takes persistent focus and time. It is order of magnitude harder to change someone else's behaviour, especially if there is no immidiate conditioning to reinforce it. Multiply this extremely high behavioral momentum with critical majority which is statistically not very smart (being smart helps a lot with any complex cognitive / behavioral learning). And you know why the 'raison d'etre' of bitcoin is not yet catching up and price appears to be soo deeply oversold based on bitcoin's \"physics\" promises..\nPrice reflects all-collective perception / behaviour. Not fundamental technical properties of the asset. Unfortunately such significant collective behavioral change may inherently need perhaps decades, unless there is no catastrophy / emergency in the society where behaving consistently with reality (bitcoin fundamentals) became key survival advantage compared to the 'old behaviour'. \n\nJust think how long it took church to pass baton over the minds of people back into the hands of individual. Based on then available fundamental theory, church being redundant, false and almost completely toxic and counterproductive entity could be broadly estabilished by educated minds already by early 15th century. Yet it took up to 19th century to make behaviour of the masses consistent with objective reality. Think of the unnecessarily self-inflicted wars, suffering and witch burning in ~400 years of the masses not being able to make beliefs/behaviour consistent with reality..\n\nNow information flow is many orders of magnitude faster and not soo violently repressed. Perhaps we can hope that next paradigm shifts could take as little time as generational change. \n\nBitcoin's success of course cant be judged by the old money (people's) failure to immidiatelly and significantly change their behaviour when most cant confront much more trivial and low hanging irrational beliefs in their lifetime.. How this is not self evident to all is beyond me.",

First mover advantage usually only lasts a limited amount of time. \n\nOnce exchanges stop using it as a base trade pair against every single alt coin there\u2019s room for another coin to move in. \n\nThe devils advocate argument though is gold. For a stupid amount of time gold has been a trading mechanism, a currency, a store of value. It\u2019s no longer used as a traditional currency. \n\nBUT: countries stack it like crazy, it\u2019s still very much a store of value. I see bitcoin going this route. So in that case, it ends up being the \u201cgold\u201d of cryptocurrency. Countries will stack it like crazy and try to hoard as much of it as they can. You can buy it as an investment, it will have a market. It won\u2019t be used as a traditional currency. In this case I see the possibility for an alt coin to come along as a true decentralized digital currency. Close to zero fees to transact on the network, likely a proof of stake architecture. \n\nWhatever coin it ends up being will need a perfect storm of code, exposure, partners, etc. it will need to be talked about on the nightly news. It will need a UX / UI that is second to none. It can\u2019t be premined. It needs to be created by a passionate person or persons who create it for altruistic reasons, not to get rich. \n\nPlenty of coins that could be used as a currency have been created but most of them were premined / airdropped to shit, or were basically created to make their creators rich. \n\nThe code will need to be flawless. That basically removes smart contract abilities. No layer two garbage. A super lightweight blockchain. \n\nI think we need a leapfrog jump in storage / storage speed capabilities before something like this will be logically possible too. Storing the world\u2019s transactions, indefinitely will only be possible if the nodes today are super computers lol. So major emphasis on lightweight. \n\nIt\u2019s possible. \n\nAfter writing all that out I feel like I changed my own mind.

After management fees (commonly 10%) plus saving for expenditures like new roof/etc that must be planned for, they're lucky to get a bit more than breaking even. You do it anyways because it's someone else paying down your mortgage, but that's often the only real benefit. (I know multiple property owners that rent but don't do it myself.)",

A robotic arm slides across the ceiling between the refrigerator and freezer rooms in the back and brings the food to the cooking machines in the kitchen area.  The machines then cook the food with precise heat and timing so that every order is al dente.  And I would have windows along the drive through, so people can watch the food cooking and getting wrapped and bagged without ever coming in contact with human hands. :)",

If you really believe in it, you'd be a lot better off convincing VC's to invest rather than trying to self-fund it, which you wouldn't be able to do with anything less than $10m. \n\nMcDonalds and others have been trying to automate as much of their kitchens as possible for decades, btw. It's a bit harder than it sounds. Rising labor prices are certainly incentivising it more now, but only the big boys have the resources to fund the research and manufacturing at scale. I don't think VC's would be into funding an automated restaurant startup, but if you really had some amazing patents and tech, you could maybe build systems to sell.

The central banks around the world are still extremely autonomous in their decision making around exactly what a CBDC should look like or even if one should exist. Many at the WEF conference were even arguing against a CBDC for the US, favoring regulated stablecoins instead.\n\nDoes the US still get a CBDC? Perhaps. Do all central banks just give up their autonomy for a global CBDC\u2026 they might as well adopt Bitcoin in that case.",
