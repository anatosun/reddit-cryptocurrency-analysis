After trying this method it didn't work. I've tried all their trouble shooting tips EXCEPT updating my phone to the latest version. After I've done this I've had no problems buying or selling.\n\nI'm not sure if it is just coincidence that it happened to work but with the rediculous fees and poor technical support I'll be looking to move on from this exchange in time due to not being reliable at key moments.\n\nPlease only use money your willing to lose on this exchange because of the unreliability.\n\nEDIT: I also tried verifying my identity at coinbase.com/verify-document",
