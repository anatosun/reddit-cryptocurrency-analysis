I'm still logged in on my browser but unable to log-in via the app which is quite annoying.\n\nI'm assuming it's maybe related to the \"connectivity issue\" they say they're experiencing when you call support but who knows.\n\nAny one else in the same boat?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Holy mother of low life scammers. It's been less than 15 minutes and I have FOUR DM requests from people claiming to be support lmao. Anywhere I can put them on a list for the sake of trying to keep the sub safe?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit #2 / Update: I gave it a few days before trying again and it worked easily. Now I'm on the path of exploring different 2FA apps thanks to the dozen comments encouraging me to do so. ",

My account got compromised right after they removed my 2FA, because they defaulted to SMS, attacker used my bank and PayPal to purchase $3,000 in BTC, CB let them withdraw the BTC immediately, which they never let me do once... They said I owe them because I got my money back from PP/bank... Inside job if you ask me, but what do I know. They can go to hell \ud83e\udd37",

You are overcharged for the asset, plus an exorbitant fee, plus half the time it doesn't work and they hold your funds. Notice: if the price of ether is 2725 dollars, and you press buy ether, the price you pay will be AT LEAST  2795 dollars. This is ontop of the sometimes 10-15 dollar fee charges they do for every transaction.  They sell SOL, but 85 percent of the time you can't withdrawl your sol from their platform.  They refuse to integrate with layer 2s, so you can't withdrawl to matic or lrc or anything else except onto the ethereum blockchain, where it costs something crazy to move it again.  Their staking services are garbage and pay you less than a quarter of what the actual token staked value is: for instance- if you stake atom through noncustodial wallet with a real validator- you receive between 16-18 percent apy. When you stake atom through coinbase they give you five percent. I stopped using coinbase for the most part a little over 8 months ago and I am SO happy I did.",

When I say limbo I mean lost and can\u2019t retrieve. \n\nI was not the only person who did this, see there is no prompt on say TRUST WALLET SIDE OR METAMASK, meaning you will lose all that money and was suppose to do test amounts however not everyone does this because we want to avoid high gas or network fees. \n\nThis is not the only time or case this has happened in fact this same exact thing happened to over thousands of others. \n\nI know personally in our community a set of wallets that sent )2200, $4000, $7000, 415,000 and even $450,0000 all to the ETH spell token and now no longer have their money. \n\nNow the one thing in our case is if product managers decide to ADD C CHAIN NETWORK SPELL TOKEN to the website we all magically will get our money back. \n\nSee AVALANCHE Token is becoming popular in general for defi world and they are the developers of C CHAIN, X CHAIN AND FANTHOM etc. so Coinbase actually sells avax and this is why so many people assumed that since this is the case that spell token in their site would also be available on C chain. \n\nIt\u2019s actually a easy fix if they just add it to the network.  However they may not and I and thousands of others who have lost millions may never see their money again. \n\nWe all make mistakes even the best of us. So with this said, I feel perhaps this type of events and people who get crushed for  almost no reason really are disappointed and dissatisfied with a bad taste in their mouth afterwards. \n\nSadly had we even sent to Coinbase pro the c chain network Spell token would Have been available on their website and your wallet. Which is insane then why they wouldn\u2019t have it on Coinbase website. As I understand it\u2019s a great one to trade in pairs for defi as it\u2019s cheaper gas than say ETH SPELL\nHence why some say Coinbase will never just add the c chain version just for all their loyal customers who made this mistake. \n\nI put a petition out there and contact them daily asking them if they added the c chain network spell token along with many others. \n\nWe think if we keep asking them about it in droves it will put their reps to work and also educate them but maybe they will want to put this topic at rest.  \n\nAs this wasn\u2019t the only case either for BEP 20 Binance.US coin has been sent to people\u2019s wallet on Coinbase don\u2019t ask me how, but look up the petition for that one, there are like 50000 plus signatures and get this WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS OVER $420,000,000$ million dollars worth of crypto is lost in the same type of limbo \n\nBUT  GET THIS NO ONE WILL EVER SEE THEIR MONEY AGAIN, as the likelihood that Coinbase ever accepts binance coin is probably slim to none. \nSadly for their sake, but who knows maybe they will configure a way to get all these peoples money back \n\nI told them I would assist and make them a documentary or kind film called \u201cCRYPTO MISTAKE\u201d where I walk people through a simple short tutorial on what not to do and what to no do as far as sending to wrong network or even wallet addresses; as they don\u2019t really explain it or put a how to about it fully.",

This will most likely nearly ruin my life as I told them my mortgage won\u2019t be paid and now I can\u2019t pay my daughters college  tuition ; this is nearly going to ruin my whole life and world for my daughter and wife; all because on simple mistakes I made in just a minute. \n\nOnce you send to the wrong address I can understand this. \n\nHowever some of us sent to the right token it just didn\u2019t have the proper network. They should be able to private network key the money and release it. But they claim they cannot. \n\nThey truly need to figure out a solution or fix. Or Start reimbursing people as it\u2019s becoming a trap for a small minority. \n\nIt\u2019s probably the main biggest problem nest to the phishing scammers stealing crypto because around this time I also had a hacker break into my email and try to extort me. It\u2019s been a crazy year and I know a guy who wrote a Reddit somewhere who said \u201cit\u2019s a year later and I still don\u2019t have my 250,000$ yet \u201c which I can\u2019t even imagine this feeling must feel like. \n\nAlong with people who lost millions for no other reason than sending money to their own self but messing up which network. \n\nThey need a refund undo button or the trust wallet or snow trace etc need to have a way to fix in case you accident make a slip up like this. \n\nIt can cost you your life savings. I may never see my money again and I haven\u2019t even told my wife yet , but she will most likely divorce me and my daughter was doing so well in college and now I won\u2019t be able to help assist her in her caterer making me the worst. \n\nThe hardest thing I have to do is break this ice to them both and my sons. \n\nThis is literally going to be the hardest thing I ever have done in my life. It\u2019s been two months and my life has been a very cold dark world, knowing Coinbase can\u2019t do a single thing to help any of us and this is maybe why so many people are leaving Coinbase but crypto in general. \n\nI used to not understand why people couldn\u2019t just do this crypto stuff but now being victim to these sort of scenarios I can see why people feel this way. \n\nI love crypto and it had changed my life for the better and then this happened and now I don\u2019t know if I ever want to do all this again. Considering what I have left is very little in wallet compared to what I had. \n\nDon\u2019t get greedy with the defi minting monthly high APY percentage DAO\u2019s \n\nI would have been better off just sitting on Shibu INu and hoping for the best. \n\nI have lost nearly everything and now all I can hope for is XRP to skyrocket after researching all its Nuances. \n\nSo be happy you aren\u2019t this guy here. \n\nI am told by Coinbase they may make this network one day or they may not. So it doesn\u2019t really help me especially as now I am two months late on my mortgage which this is where that money was coming from. \n\nWish me the best if any of y\u2019all can sign my petition it would help a lot. We maybe will show Coinbase a good enough reason to why they should take the time to add c chain spell token. \n\nThanks for hearing me out. Just needed vent. Ready to make my daily coinbase rep contact daily awareness check up date. \nI basically tell this story one time or more a day or every so often \nTo a new Coinbase rep and try help spread this awareness for those who may not know about these topics.  \n\nI\u2019m shocked Coinbase doesn\u2019t pay me to make this documentary and put a giant red flag out there for people to see and make sure they don\u2019t make the same mistake. \n\nKindest regards \n\nThe guy who lost it all and sent to the wrong network address and now will lose my physical home address. How ironic and sad. \n\n~Goodbye my life.",

For future reference...any company or site thats using a modified name of an already successful company is a scam.  \n\nFor instance if you're shopping for a Tesla and come across a company called Teslax...that's a scam.  \n\nIf you come across a coin in crypto and its called Bitcoinia or EtherShibDoge those are also scams.  \n\nExpensive learning lesson, but never trust any of these sites that claim \"if you give us your money\" will make you rich.  Just think about it...what guarantee is there that you'll get your money back?  What can you do, if they don't give you your money back?  The answer = nothing.  \n\nThis is no different than those sites that say \"send me 1 ETH and I'll send you 2\".  No one on this planet is trying to make you rich or give you money for no reason.  Why would they?\n\nTake this as an expensive learning lesson and never trust projects like this again.  Find a reputable exchange, a secure wallet, buy and hold, that is how ppl get rich thru investing over the long term.  \n\nI'm sorry but that money was gone as soon as you deposited it.  You need to delete whatever wallet you have connected to that site as it is compromised.  \n\nSorry you had to learn this expensive lesson but if it sounds too good to be true it is.  Best of luck",

If I wish to change from Coinbase to antother company, which exchange would be better?\n\n2. How may you transfer funds from Coinbase to such NEW & Different Exchange?\n\n\n3. Would you advise such transition?\n\n\n(To give you a very brief summary of context\u2026 I have about 7 Crypto Coins on my humble Coinbase Portfolio which is COMPLETELY BLOCKED from either Buying or Selling as both my Nationality and Geographical Location are from a Country in South America. \n\nNo matter if you use a VPN or whatever\u2026 I\u2019m basically stuck since last year due my \u201clegal paperwork\u201d as most South American countries are literally blocked from buying/selling\u2026 all I\u2019m allowed to do is send, receive, and hold my Crypto. \n\nNow, I\u2019m completely aware that other Platforms will most likely block me from buying/selling just as Coinbase. \n\nNevertheless, I want the peace of mind that my assets are in the safest, most secure, and fair platform + a company that may have a better, more positive Customer Service).\n\nRespectfully to everyone. Thank you all!",
