You are overcharged for the asset, plus an exorbitant fee, plus half the time it doesn't work and they hold your funds. Notice: if the price of ether is 2725 dollars, and you press buy ether, the price you pay will be AT LEAST  2795 dollars. This is ontop of the sometimes 10-15 dollar fee charges they do for every transaction.  They sell SOL, but 85 percent of the time you can't withdrawl your sol from their platform.  They refuse to integrate with layer 2s, so you can't withdrawl to matic or lrc or anything else except onto the ethereum blockchain, where it costs something crazy to move it again.  Their staking services are garbage and pay you less than a quarter of what the actual token staked value is: for instance- if you stake atom through noncustodial wallet with a real validator- you receive between 16-18 percent apy. When you stake atom through coinbase they give you five percent. I stopped using coinbase for the most part a little over 8 months ago and I am SO happy I did.",

For future reference...any company or site thats using a modified name of an already successful company is a scam.  \n\nFor instance if you're shopping for a Tesla and come across a company called Teslax...that's a scam.  \n\nIf you come across a coin in crypto and its called Bitcoinia or EtherShibDoge those are also scams.  \n\nExpensive learning lesson, but never trust any of these sites that claim \"if you give us your money\" will make you rich.  Just think about it...what guarantee is there that you'll get your money back?  What can you do, if they don't give you your money back?  The answer = nothing.  \n\nThis is no different than those sites that say \"send me 1 ETH and I'll send you 2\".  No one on this planet is trying to make you rich or give you money for no reason.  Why would they?\n\nTake this as an expensive learning lesson and never trust projects like this again.  Find a reputable exchange, a secure wallet, buy and hold, that is how ppl get rich thru investing over the long term.  \n\nI'm sorry but that money was gone as soon as you deposited it.  You need to delete whatever wallet you have connected to that site as it is compromised.  \n\nSorry you had to learn this expensive lesson but if it sounds too good to be true it is.  Best of luck",

If you cannot get into your account, it has been compromised.  Call the Coinbase number to lock your account.\n5. If you still have access to your account set up a real 2FA - cell phone SMS is not secure. At a minimum use Google or MS Authenticator, even better use hardware like YubiKey\n6. You can also setup address whitelisting in coinbase pro, which can slow down scammers/hackers.",

Would you advise such transition?\n\n\n(To give you a very brief summary of context\u2026 I have about 7 Crypto Coins on my humble Coinbase Portfolio which is COMPLETELY BLOCKED from either Buying or Selling as both my Nationality and Geographical Location are from a Country in South America. \n\nNo matter if you use a VPN or whatever\u2026 I\u2019m basically stuck since last year due my \u201clegal paperwork\u201d as most South American countries are literally blocked from buying/selling\u2026 all I\u2019m allowed to do is send, receive, and hold my Crypto. \n\nNow, I\u2019m completely aware that other Platforms will most likely block me from buying/selling just as Coinbase. \n\nNevertheless, I want the peace of mind that my assets are in the safest, most secure, and fair platform + a company that may have a better, more positive Customer Service).\n\nRespectfully to everyone.
