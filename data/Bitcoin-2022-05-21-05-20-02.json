            "selftext": "I made a post the other day on bitcoin inquiring about my first bitcoin purchase. The post got taken down due to multiple accusations. Just to confess, I am 13 in school, the purchase was made under my dads name and there is no real legal age to trade bitcoin. If this post gets taken down again I really don't care I will just go to Quora because all im simply seeking is advice. Here was the post:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am 13 years old and am looking to make money for college funds and my future career. I don't have any money in the bank I could spend on bitcoin, but I remembered I had around 20 Dollars in an old Skrill account of mine, which is now 10 Dollars because of fine's for inactivity. I have seen Bitcoin at a stable level after its massive drop so I though now would be the time to buy with knowledge from trading virtual money on the stock exchange. Was it a good idea in thought it is my first ever Bitcoin purchase or should I have waited?",

This is very sharp, especially for someone your age.\n\nIf you want to buy $10 worth of Bitcoin- go nuts. It\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll get rich or earn enough to pay for college with that investment but you might make a couple bucks and hopefully learn a ton along the way.\n\nIf you really want to start making tangible progress towards your college savings, there\u2019s really one key thing you should do- get a job. Borrow money to buy a shovel and/or lawn mower and start offering your services to neighbors. You\u2019d be surprised how much you can make in your spare time if you work hard.",

Never before did our ancestors have somewhere to channel their labour/value that was objectively scarce, safe, sound, easy to use & move, and free of any government or borders.\n\nNo government can (truly) stop it. No central bank can inflate it. No thief can burgle it from you, and If you're smart, no hacker can get it either. By being objectively neutral, immutable, not managed by flawed & corruptible humans and away from the physical space, we've finally got there: a property that we truly own and can't be ruined by these assholes. While we may have tax, your property can no longer rot or expire - your value can, and increasingly will, be that much safer from their greedy, grubby hands.\n\nAlthough we're seeing the value pump and dump with a slow march upwards, fiat is \\*guaranteed\\* to go down (We all know this. Even your internet-illiterate parents know this). That says one thing: if you buy bitcoin, your value will either stabilise against inflation on average at worst, or it'll increase at best. with further adoption and greater technological innovations (e.g. lightning) the odds of bitcoin being supreme (which are already huge) are just going up and up too. It's truly inevitable.\n\nSo be brave. Don't let those assholes scare you off. Provided you're paying the bills in the mean time, you've got nothing to lose. Don't lose sight of what's on the horizon.",

When times get tough, they take their emergency funds out of BTC or actually use it to buy things before the stock market has time to respond. After all, it's usually easier to move the stuff than to sell shares. Even as the market continues to decline over the last week, BTC has been stable in price. It took its hit on the front end  \n\nWhen times get easy, people rebuild their portfolios & retirements & then get brave and start buying into crypto. This sends the price skyrocketing in comparison to everything else. But it requires that there's people with disposable income  \n\nBasically, the time to buy is during economic recovery. BTC's the last asset type to go up so it's very easy to watch the world improve and know that BTC's price will eventually increase. OTOH, there's no good time to sell unless you have a crystal ball to predict crises that'll scare people out of BTC or eat their disposable income. BTC's the first thing being sold so there's zero warning a drop is coming  \n\n^not ^financial ^advice, ^I ^am ^an ^idiot",
