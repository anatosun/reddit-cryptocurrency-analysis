Buying sends the price up. If the market believes the price should be \u20ac100k, it will push the price up until it\u2019s \u20ac100k, not at the end of the year, right now. Because you calculate your future value based on a growth rate, you can buy and sell constantly in the period and continuously make money, e.g buy at \u20ac27k because it\u2019s really worth \u20ac100k; sell at \u20ac30k, buy at \u20ac31k, sell at \u20ac40k etc. because there are tens of thousands of positions whereby you will profit from purchasing an undervalued asset that is on its way to its true value, and tens of thousands of other people doing the same.\n\nThis activity (and enough players in the market doing the same thing, all safe in the knowledge that one day they can sell for \u20ac100k) is what a bear market is. If everyone in the market just holds on to their bitcoin, you\u2019ll all lose your money. There has to be liquidity in the market or there is no market. \n\nA price of \u20ac100k would require billions upon billions in liquidity to sustain even a day\u2019s trading, and not many will have deep enough pockets for that. And who would buy at \u20ac100k? Someone safe in the knowledge that it will one day be worth \u20ac200k. And so on. It\u2019s simply the concept of perfect competition, operating on perfect information, like any stock. \n\nBack in reality, bitcoin\u2019s price is falling because the analysis doesn\u2019t support the opinion of long term growth of the asset value. Institutional investors have either realized their gains or cashed out their loss. All that\u2019s left is \u201cwell the price went up before\u201d to justify the assumption that it\u2019ll go up again. It\u2019s literally a case of buy bitcoin, something something, profit. You never hear the same bold predictions of the value of Twitter stock, or palladium or whatever. \n\nAnyone who bought BTC in the last 6 months but still holds it today has lost their money. If they held it longer than that, and didn\u2019t sell when it was above \u20ac50k, I don\u2019t know what to tell you other than you aren\u2019t an investor, you\u2019re just playing the lottery with a more expensive ticket and a smaller jackpot.",
