Didn\u2019t pull the trigger in 2020 when I should have and now I see another opportunity. \n\n I want to invest $25 a week starting out and eventually up that to $50 ( quitting tobacco) and 1-2k a year at income tax time. I can see a bitcoin worth 200k-500k in the next 5-10years and I\u2019m wanting to retire early and provide a better life for my newborn son. \n\n Is putting this much into bitcoin and a few dollars into some altcoins(lottery scratcher coins) a good strategy or should I diversify into other coins?\n\n Using Coinbase pro for buying and getting the card from them for the 1-2% bitcoin rewards",

A pound of gold back 1000 years could buy you a whole lot more than a pound of gold these days. If inflation becomes too high, that's when a currency loses its \"store of value\" state and people will flee to a more stable currency. That's why the USD is so value all over the world.

Inflation is only caused by the dollar losing its value rapidly/ depreciating.

They do not teach you this in public schools.  You'll have to educate yourself.  Inflation doesn't happen on its own magically.  It all starts with the ever depreciating dollar.  We use an old debt accumulating debt monetary system that we copied from the Roman's.  This is not new at all.  Our dollar will always lose value,  always.  This eliminates it as a store of value.  Don't believe the lies you have been told about gold either.  A pound of gold today is worth a lot more than a pound of gold 20 years ago.  This is all because the dollar is worth less today than it was 20 years ago.  It's very simple.  If you hold a bunch of cash for the next 50 years it will lose more than half of its value than it currently has.  It is not a store of value.  Only puppets/ sheep believe this.",

Why is that? Because it\u2019s shiny? It\u2019s hardness? Or because you know it cannot be created by man? Gold is well known to be God\u2019s money after all. \n\nThe scarcity of gold is universally recognised and understood by cultures and civilisations across thousands of years. \n\nOther than gold, humanity has never seen anything that could rival the value proposition of gold, it\u2019s scarcity and the fact that it cannot be created by another human being\u2026and then Bitcoin happened.\n\nI have no idea what the future will hold but it\u2019s certainly and exciting proposition. A future where humanity, for the first time ever, universally recognises and hands down to their children, an asset that is even more scarce than gold. \n\nI believe bitcoin will be around for many generations and will outlive all of us, as the gold rush for mining steadily increases until the very last bitcoin is rewarded by the protocol. Though of course, what events might unfold after the last bitcoin has been mined is a hefty topic on it\u2019s own.\n\nThere is a generational shift in how people think about assets. While there will always be people who do not believe in anything they can\u2019t physically hold or see, they will reduce in number over time. We cannot outpace digital revolutions. Network effects are exponential. There will be a point when you\u2019ll be ridiculed for *not* holding bitcoin or digital assets. \n\nThis will be especially true when governments begin to seize gold, as they consistently do throughout history. It\u2019s quite easy to do since most people leaves their stockpiles in safety deposits. Gold is cumbersome, expensive and risky to self custody.\nBut any corporation that holds *your* gold will hand it over to the government if told. Will they try to seize digital assets too? Absolutely. Any corporation/exchange under government order will hand over the bitcoin. But the difference is that the majority of bitcoin is already off the exchanges, locked away in cold storage and kept offline until they\u2019re handed down as inheritance. Or they will be kept inside the memory of countless individuals that can now cross borders with their entire net worth inside their head. The first time humanity has been able to do so. Ever. Gold\u2019s obstacle of traversing through space and time has finally been solved.\n\nGold has been the undisputed king of humanity\u2019s universal store of wealth for the last 5000 years. But now we live in an age where the next 5000 years could be dominated by an entirely new asset class. And there will most likely be none that can replicate the immaculate conception of Bitcoin.

Tonga has now embarked on a similar path.\nI speculate that over time, as more countries, even cities, use bitcoin to establish reserves, and as other large holders of assets do the same, the market cap will grow so large that the volatility will drop and speculation (vs saving) will be less rewarding.\n\nThat said, in the many countries in which inflation is well over 20% (Turkey, Argentina) the demand for bitcoin as inflation hedge is much stronger.",

Pretending you do is a fallacy.\n\nThe year 2022 is a first for bitcoin too... but the year number doesn't affect much. Just because something is new doesn't make it meaningful.\n\n> Then why isn't Bitcoin surging? You are ignoring the correlation between BTC and the stock market that is occurred with institutional adoption. I don't know how anyone can seriously argue Bitcoin is an inflation hedge anymore.\n\nWhy doesn't gold surge early ? Same overall reason.\n\nThe point here is that inflation and stock market  correlation are not red flags. The point is that bitcoin is finally entering the financial waters it was designed for.\n\nThis is like a boat leaving drydock for the ocean for the first time.\n\nThis is what it's all been about.\n\nWe don't know for sure if it will sink or sail, but this is the moment we have all been waiting for. This is bitcoin finally being tested at what it is designed to do. Today's hopeless investing landscape is why we bitcoin.",

When interest rates rise, investors pull out of risky assets and move into safer higher yield assets. Just look at how Bitcoin correlates with the stock market these days for proof of what I am saying. It's no longer a P2P currency among message board nerds.\n\n>You can\u2019t use interest rates against bitcoin\n\nIf this was true then Bitcoin would actually be going up as interest rates rise and inflation is high. But it's not. Ask yourself why Bitcoin has been sliding the last 6 months along with the stock market... It's not a mystery anymore.",

Essentially...The previous bull top, will be the next bear markets bottom. So while 200k BTC maybe a top...70k (ish) would be the next bottom. Basically. I think.",

DCA is technical investment without feelings, that's not my character. I never try to time the market, but when I have some extra money, I decide, if I'm happy with the actual price. This is not exact science, but it depends on the market sentiment. Was below $50k a good price a few month ago? Yes, it was from ATH perspective these days, a great dip. Not from today. But I can't foresee the future.\nAs I was happy with every single buy, I don't complain about lower prices today. I'm just happy for my BTC.",

I\u2019m of the opinion that it would have little effect on the macro trend of GDP flow into Bitcoin. I work on the assumption that 10-20% of global wealth will be held in bitcoin within the next 20 years, leading me to the conclusion that the prices we are seeing are extremely attractive regardless of the overall economic environment that transpires.\n\nBitcoin emerged precisely because of the economic conditions you describe. Also, please be kind - you can disagree with my conclusions without needing to call me an idiot.",

There's a decent argument to be made to DCA at that point though and if you see prices like 10K keep loading, you may never see that price. The 200 weeksl so far has never been violated which is around that 20K area. At the same time a median cycle correction would put things somewhere between 9 and 15K. Everyone is looking around these areas though so you have to see if people are going to frontrun them or if they get burned down. Right now there's still a lot of optimism which needs to go away. A continued puking of price will have that effect especially as we go into the end of the year. Last cycle everyone was fine with 6K and it was that final drop to three that broke people",

Think of art in this way. Example: the canvas was $50, paint was $100, yet the painting is worth $1,000,000 in someone's eyes based on their personal connection to it- this is called personal value. \nMonetary value is a mathematical formula using something common amongst the consumers (such as a medium- currently USD) and goods/ services to be purchased.  Monetary value is highly manipulated and controlled by politics and many other powers/ factors.  Personal value is always up to you and nobody else can control it.",
