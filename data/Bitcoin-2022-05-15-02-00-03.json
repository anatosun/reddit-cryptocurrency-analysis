Didn\u2019t pull the trigger in 2020 when I should have and now I see another opportunity. \n\n I want to invest $25 a week starting out and eventually up that to $50 ( quitting tobacco) and 1-2k a year at income tax time. I can see a bitcoin worth 200k-500k in the next 5-10years and I\u2019m wanting to retire early and provide a better life for my newborn son. \n\n Is putting this much into bitcoin and a few dollars into some altcoins(lottery scratcher coins) a good strategy or should I diversify into other coins?\n\n Using Coinbase pro for buying and getting the card from them for the 1-2% bitcoin rewards",

There were some experiments like in El Salvador - so need to have a closer look of how that plays out.\nBTC as a safe haven asset has also not emerged yet. Tbd if it correlates with gold.\nAs a hedge for CPI inflation it did not correlate so far. Asset price inflation following real estate price inflation it correlates potentially. More likely in a more responsive way and could even be used as an indicator for global real estate prices. \nWhere I still have hope is BTC for global remmitance especially during global economic crisis.

It has proved successful as a form of payment in places with collapsed/collapsing currencies as a safe haven asset.\n\n\nIt makes sense as global inflation increases we should see more people flock to bitcoin.  But that's not the case, not everyone who trades bitcoin uses it's main value proposition, some treat it as any other asset to trade etc.  I suspect over time and during economic crisis we will see a transition of more financially privileged countries using bitcoin more like a currency i.e. primarily a medium of exchange and secondary a store of value.",

DCA is technical investment without feelings, that's not my character. I never try to time the market, but when I have some extra money, I decide, if I'm happy with the actual price. This is not exact science, but it depends on the market sentiment. Was below $50k a good price a few month ago? Yes, it was from ATH perspective these days, a great dip. Not from today. But I can't foresee the future.\nAs I was happy with every single buy, I don't complain about lower prices today. I'm just happy for my BTC.",
