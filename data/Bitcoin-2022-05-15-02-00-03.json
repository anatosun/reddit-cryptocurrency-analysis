Didn\u2019t pull the trigger in 2020 when I should have and now I see another opportunity. \n\n I want to invest $25 a week starting out and eventually up that to $50 ( quitting tobacco) and 1-2k a year at income tax time. I can see a bitcoin worth 200k-500k in the next 5-10years and I\u2019m wanting to retire early and provide a better life for my newborn son. \n\n Is putting this much into bitcoin and a few dollars into some altcoins(lottery scratcher coins) a good strategy or should I diversify into other coins?\n\n Using Coinbase pro for buying and getting the card from them for the 1-2% bitcoin rewards",

DCA is technical investment without feelings, that's not my character. I never try to time the market, but when I have some extra money, I decide, if I'm happy with the actual price. This is not exact science, but it depends on the market sentiment. Was below $50k a good price a few month ago? Yes, it was from ATH perspective these days, a great dip. Not from today. But I can't foresee the future.\nAs I was happy with every single buy, I don't complain about lower prices today. I'm just happy for my BTC.",
