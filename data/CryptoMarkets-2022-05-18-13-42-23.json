Private companies fundraising before IPO\n\nYou might have heard of CrowdCube, if not you can go check them out, basically crowdfunding platform for all kinds of companies (a lot of alcohol and fintech tho)\n\nAngelblock is coming out with that on Ethereum so Blockchain companies can fundraise from the public instead of relying on VC's to fund them which can get sketchy\n\nI really like the idea, and want to use it.",

Some fulfill this by hiring the raw skills of the user. I am talking about KOLnet, a Project that monetizes influencers in lieu of their social media marketing services. A rarity i this space , but coming out strong and mass adoption is on its way.",
