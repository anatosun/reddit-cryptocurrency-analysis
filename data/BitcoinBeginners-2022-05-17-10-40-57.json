Only invest in things you are educated on and believe in. For example, right now you are \u201conly seeing losses\u201d because you\u2019re still thinking Bitcoin is \u201cworth\u201d something in fiat currency (US dollars, British sterling, Japanese yen, etc.).\n\nDon\u2019t drop $1k into this because your friend is saying so.\n\nInstead, hop over to YouTube and watch Andreas Antonopolous\u2019 video \u201cIntro to Bitcoin\u201d. Begin to study it and learn it.\n\nEducation and investing go hand-in-hand for everything. Don\u2019t invest if you don\u2019t understand it. Empower your mind, and you\u2019ll decide if Bitcoin is right for you. If it is, you\u2019ll eventually get to the point where you can decouple Bitcoin from what it\u2019s \u201cworth\u201d in fiat currency.\n\nTl;Dr - Don\u2019t take investment advice from your friend if you don\u2019t understand Bitcoin.",
