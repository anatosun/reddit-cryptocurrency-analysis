            "selftext": "Regulation is coming for altcoins. Most of the 17,000 will disappear. This is the s-curve adoption shakeout we as bitcoiners have been warning about for years. SEC Chair Gary Gensler met with the FTC on Wednesday, and again reiterated that bitcoin is NOT a security, but that \"*Many, I'd say most of the others are securities*.\" \n\n[https://twitter.com/hodlerforlife/status/1527705100059258880?s=20&t=BVRnn-2FkOVJ37GwM7CtAw](https://twitter.com/hodlerforlife/status/1527705100059258880?s=20&t=BVRnn-2FkOVJ37GwM7CtAw)\n\nSome folks have suggested that getting designated a security won't affect their coin or protocol. They are terribly mistaken. This designation means you have to follow the established legal framework for securities:\n\n* You can't transfer a security to someone that is not registered to receive securities. If you do, in order to redeem it they must register. Otherwise you can transfer them freely as they are a property, but only to persons or institutions registered. International sales have their own sets of rules.\n* You cannot issue coins or tokens. This requires form S-3. \n* Insiders/Devs/DAO's cannot sell their securities without a form S-4. More importantly, they can no longer trade on material action before the public knows, which is an enormous problem currently, especially amongst exchanges. This is a crime if you are trading securities.\n\nAnd so on. There is no effort to rewrite American securities laws to accommodate the unique properties of crypto, which instead will meet the burden by complying with the rigor and legal framework everything else does.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvu60wzyct091.jpg?width=1074&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e38929d5113fe526747b1a7c054527a3c402d0f\n\nThe coins-tokens-protocols that get designated securities don't have to comply of course. If they don't want to change their protocol, register their brass, and create a hierarchical chain of command for reporting, then:\n\n* They'll be delisted by every centralized exchange within 90 days\n* All their wallets/apps will be deleted from Apple and Google Play\n* No taxpaying company will accept them as payment\n* Promoting the ticker or coin in any way will be a crime\n* All major stablecoins will cease to operate within their protocols--and this might be the most insurmountable obstacle, because 85% of ALL altcoin volume is from stablecoins. That means nothing inside an alt protocol has established itself as money--except for stablecoins\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Web3](https://preview.redd.it/36jdgpibdt091.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b3b04861391c022dd8c7af932637cbdd4d7d8ea)\n\nIf these projects were decentralized and impairment resistant to begin with, none of this would be happening. They just couldn't avoid those pre-mines for money though. Their founders loved the spotlight too. If they at least had fixed issuance, they could mitigate some of their problems. But besides BTC, few projects come to mind that can circumvent all these travails; the leading privacy coin certainly can; but even the coin beginning with *Lite* and the one represented by a dog symbol could be in danger of getting this black securities label. If delisted, the only real way to acquire these zombified things would be to take something that isn't a security (like BTC), transfer it to a DEX, then swap into it. Point is, getting designated a security is effectively a date with gravity from the 50th floor, because you are now in the sandbox with the same rules real public companies, real bonds, and real products must adhere to. Can your vaporware compete? Because if you're not money, what are you exactly? Nothing. You're an orgy of swaps, wraps, burns, mints, and stakes run by centralized dapps that do nothing but optimize token interactions to keep the orgy going. Here's a better way to say this: If your dapp is a centralized registered security with full KYC, why does it need a blockchain exactly? To shill its speculative token. There's no real business or service there. \n\nExchanges don't have profitable business models without a robust (expletive)coin market. Bitcoin isn't something they can control and the open source tech around it is a race to zero. Add in the fact that BTC has established itself as money, and you'll see a nascent circular economy already growing around BTC. When it gets big enough (goods services sold in BTC), then exchanges are really no longer necessary. So maybe they'll spin-off the bitcoin business, miners might acquire them, exchanges might consolidate, who knows. I do know the days of easy money are gone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ycsy7yblct091.jpg?width=1884&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a30d46068016095e2677e693d4243158fd43a88\n\nI think Gary Gensler is a bit naive on what these security designations will do to these protocols that heretofore have been hiding behind the word *decentralization* and acting like they're going to do something of value someday. He also doesn't understand fully what impact it will have on exchanges either. Bitcoiners are smiling of course, because two birds are getting hit with one stone. Centralized bitcoin-only exchanges (and apps) like Block's CashApp, Strike, Swan, etcetera won't be burdened with any of this extra paperwork, insurance costs, lawsuits, lawyers, or blockchain forensic add-ons. \n\nMy dark maximalism really starts sweating through my shirt thinking about the bloody mess of red ink  we'll be mopping up though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqs5urelet091.jpg?width=311&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=669278e4ef4aaaf8d40995792a3cf227efa66d14",

This requires form S-3.\n\n* Insiders/Devs/DAO's cannot sell their securities without a form S-4. More importantly, they can no longer trade on material action before the public knows, which is an enormous problem currently, especially amongst exchanges. This is a crime if you are trading securities.\n\nGo easy on me. Aren\u2019t all three of the above inherently good? No more rugpulls, insider trading, ponzis?

It's deadly for everything else though because as a security, shareholders/tokenholders have legal ownership. The easy money that DAO's, devs, and VC's are accustomed to goes away. Oversight is amplified. The space is going to lose quite a bit of talent which goes to where the money is, which I believe will be the applications and real businesses built over the LN. Then there's the issue that the facade of *decentralization* is gone. Blockchain technology really has zero value without this. They are slow, expensive, and difficult to maintain things.

And if they're not worth a whole lot, lose their liquidity, and won't pump, devs leave, DAO's weaken, security erodes, and protocols go zombie. Rat kings take things over. Everyone packs up like gypsies and goes to where the money is. Most recently that's been NFT jpegs. Before that it was DeFi middleware. Before that it was ICO vaporware. You'd assume that next it would be web3 or the meta verse, but when those terms are vaporware themselves... Eventually they all end up developing on the LN because that will be where the money is.",

People with no understanding or even remote interest or support for cypherpunk ideology have flooded in en masse because they think buying crypto more than a decade too late is a free ride to lambos and cocaine orgies. \n\nThe average \u201ccryptards\u201d these days can\u2019t contribute even a modicum of development and do not understand the implications or correct context in which to view the technology. The space is dragged down by this whole \u201cmass adoption\u201d bullshit which really just turns into shilling scams to people who have never and never will have a legitimate use case for decentralized currency. The vast majority of the market is either a scam, a speculative trading vehicle, or both as an inverse of \u201cbuild it and they will come\u201d.

Simplicity is a fundamental security practice, and bitcoin exploits this with informational scarcity (block size, minimal scripting, etc). Bitcoin doesn't target a stable price. It targets a variable price. It's PoW can control issuance, and the free market sets the price. When it absorbs enough trust (value) its confidence curve (volatility) will flatten. This is a long, difficult, and organic step towards a transactional reserve currency from the simple store of value (collateral) phase.\n\nIt seems to me everyone tries replicating bitcoin the price's success by augmenting bitcoin the network's complexity. All gimmicks, from silly PoS consensus mechanisms, to messy scaling layers, all born in a time when exchanges and stablecoins already exist to Hansel and Gretal them fat. They don't realize the real innovation of bitcoin's stack is the energy  bonding it all together. They also seem to believe they can simply skip the store of value phase and be instantly accepted as a transactional currency to the world--which only fiat backed stablecoins can do.

And to answer at your question for them ... they need blockchain somewhere around the title cause else they won't get the investments to build this shit up ! \n\nYet of we were to stay with the feet on the ground and think logical about it for a moment we must admit to ourselves 2 had truths : \n\n1 - Any blockchain is bound by the same lousy ass TRILLEMA : SCALABILITY - SECURITY - DECENTRIZATION ! You can only have 2 out of 3 so make your choice worthwhile !!!\n\n2 - Speaking about choice : We keep on forgetting that it's not about logic, matter of truth that lies in the token of choice but about people !!! People choose good or bad, and most of the times people defend their bad choice till the last breath \ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd23 it had a name in psichology I forgot... Maybe that's why so many shit projects are still standing !!!
