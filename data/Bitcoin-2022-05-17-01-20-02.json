            "selftext": "the trend of the general market. Now that the price of the currency has reached saturation and is basically up less and down more, I do not recommend doing stored value in cryptocurrencies.                                                                              I do short-term trading of cryptocurrencies, which is very popular internationally. It is different from holding cryptocurrencies directly, it is based on the quotes of digital currencies, I usually combine the analysis of trend charts, use the 28 laws plus the Kelly formula to make calculations, and buy in both directions after risk avoidance, as long as the prediction is correct, you can make money, it is a more stable short-term investment than stocks and real estate.",

Therefore, you will have to pay short term capital gains taxes (which are higher than long term capital gains). You will have to calculate your cost basis for every buy order (say $29,000) to match with every sell order (say $31,000, as reported by the exchange), so that you only have to pay taxes on $2000 profit.  Currently, the short term capital gains tax varies between 10% and 37% depending on how much money you profited in a calendar year.",

You are also at the whims of government control which has already happened.\n\nI would advise to not use an app or CEX. If you hold just small amount it\u2019s fine but if you hold bags then your also at risk from people near you and could get jumped, scammed , honeypot .. etc.. I\u2019m not saying it would happen but you have to take your precautions like you get insurance for your house and vehicle.  \n\nSo, you have to figure out your situation and how secure you want to be.
