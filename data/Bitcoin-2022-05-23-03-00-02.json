I can spend the next 1000 hours learning everything I can about digital crypto security And probably do a pretty good job of self custody... But then what? What about 6 months from now when everything is changing? I just don't have the time or energy to keep up to date. \n\nI will let the experts handle it Thank you very much :)",

Try not to think about or look at the price\n\nThe advice is always to not be emotional with investing. I just use it to my advantage. Feeling happy about my financial situation? That probably means values are high so just stick to regular DCA. Feeling sad about my financial future? This means it is the time to buy more. Crank up the DCA, throw whatever extra fiat at it. I use this for all my investing, BTC, real estate, stocks. As the famous quote goes, \"You make most of your money in a bear market, you just don't know it at the time\". This keeps me from doing anything stupid at bottoms and keeps me from overbuying at highs. The regular DCA is because I do not know what the future holds. I do not pretend to think I can time markets, thus the DCA, but I do know my happy/sad market indicator works to make me stick it out and to increase my assets when prices are best.",
