Bitcoin is young and in price discovery mode. Thats why gold doesnt show the price volatility that bitcoin shows.\n\nGold might be expensive to store but you can physically defend it. Its not like if someone sees the gold, its theirs now. Like your private keys. Physical property rights are more easily enforceable. The thing that works for bitcoin is that security doesnt become more expensive the more bitcoin you hold. Yes thats a plus. But bitcoin security has its own quirks. How often do you see people get scammed out of their gold?\n\nGold only needs to be verified the first time you buy it. Its a small price to pay.\n\nThe additional sources of gold are priced into the gold market. The market has been running for 5000 years. Its efficient as fuck by now. Humans discover new sources every now and then and still gold gets eaten up.\n\nThe 21 million of bitcoin is just as good a guess as to what people guestimate about gold. Because we would never be able to verify bitcoins 21 million supply. None of us would be alive. And as it runs over social consensus, we cant surely talk about what our future generations do with bitcoin. They might implement an inflation rate due to more social concerns. You see it even now where senators and people want wealth just distributed. \n\nThe actual idiot is the one that just holds one. The person who holds both needs to be attacked in two completely different ways to be stolen of his wealth. And thats just a better security model for ones wealth.\n\nLand, gold and bitcoin is the way.",

It\u2019s exclusively about the legal structure of the investment vehicle as a trust. \n\n- ETFs have a \u201ccreation and redemption\u201d mechanism that allows the asset manager to add new shares of the ETF when the asset gets into premium territory and dissolve shares when it gets into discount territory, such that it closely approximates the underlying assets\u2019 value. \n\n- Grayscale being a trust (not an ETF) has a \u2018create\u2019 mechanism but no redemption option. Grayscale cannot dissolve shares as people sell them. For this reason, Grayscale themselves states, \u201cThere can be no assurance that the value of the shares will approximate the value of the Bitcoin held by the Trust and the shares may trade at a substantial premium over or discount to the value of the Trust's Bitcoin.\u201d \n\n- GBTC was the only way for one to gain btc exposure in the equity market for a while, and traded at a premium at that time. Then other options like Canadian ETFs, Futures ETFs, and MSTR, came along. As investors moved away from GBTC\ntowards the other options that didn\u2019t charge 2% fees, the prem turned into a discount. Grayscale, in its current Trust form, can do nothing about this discount.\n\nSo \u2026 Is it an opportunity? Maybe. If their ETF application is approved, the creation/redemption process will bring the discount to 0 (and a holder of GBTC will capture ~30% overnight). If it\u2019s never made into an ETF while a different spot ETF is approved, I\u2019d imagine that discount is going to get much deeper.",
