But I'm also having trouble trusting one of these 3rd party cold wallet companies.\n\nFor example 'Ledger' claims on its website that it doesn't store user's private keys. Is there a way to actually confirm this? Or are we basically putting our faith in Ledger to be honest?  What prevents them from stealing keys/crypto if Ledger goes bankrupt?",

In order to know which transactions have happened on the network, a wallet needs to have a source for this knowledge. A full node is such a source. If you don't use your own node, you (your wallet) are using someone else's node, with all the implications for your privacy and trust assumptions. Using your own full node also gives you more privacy because you're not leaking any information like your IP address, bitcoin addresses, and transaction history to third parties.

There are a huge ton of people who are careful about these things with serious money on stake. Some will absolutely be able to detect if there were transmitters active and if *any* was found, ever, the whole planet would know within a few hours, or at least the people within the sector, and the manufacturer would be done. The fact that this never happened even once is pretty indicative.\n\nFact of the matter is, hardware wallets are the absolute maximum level of security unless you're willing to dedicate millions in budget for dedicated security practices. So if you're unsatisfied with this level of security, either pay those millions, or you're out of luck because nothing better is known on the planet.",

Also no digital copies. No photos, no text files, don't store online etc. Write it down ***carefully*** when you first create your wallet, then transfer it to a more durable medium like a steel plate in the near future to prevent against loss due to destruction (fire, water, decay, etc).

After a couple years of hundreds of people on reddit recommending the Trezor, that's what I got. Trezor certainly could introduce a firmware update that snatches my funds and I would not know about it until it made the mainstream news or a reddit post. Unless you are a highly knowledgeable software engineer who can check the open source code yourself, you are correct that there will always be an element of trust, but the combined trust of many users of an established open source hardware wallet is about as trustworthy as possible.",
