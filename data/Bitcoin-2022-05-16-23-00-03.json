I got my card, finally, and tried to verify my identity so strike doesn't get in trouble when the government asks to spy on me, and strike just deleted my account. No discussion. No follow up. Support literally repeats the same thing every time I try and get more information. This or something similar happen to anyone else?\n\nI guess I'll just send Coinbase a bunch of money instead? Coinbase seems to like money. Is Strike run by retards?",

They saw a foreign IP address when you tried to verify and flagged it as a stolen account. Once it's been flagged it's probably not worth the risk to them to deal with helping you, especially since you've never actually sent them any money yet. Maybe you can make a new account?",
