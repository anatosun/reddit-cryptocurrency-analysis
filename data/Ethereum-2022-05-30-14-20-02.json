My objective is to find some well paid job as a begginer developer in the Defi ecosystem.\n\nRight now I have thought about two courses: Consensys (The Blockchain Developer Program On-Demand, 295$) and the recently published course from Freecodecamp (30hour complete course).\n\nAlso I have thought about learning from Alchemy and Ethereum.org.\n\nJust to introduce a little bit my background, used to work in banking consulting, I got algorithmic trading experience with python (Using Binance API) also had build few codes to buy tokens and getting data from blockchains, AVAX, BSC and FTM mainnly. And for the lasts months I was a full time Degen, so got experience with DEFI, Metamask, tx, NFT, shitcoins, etc.\n\nCan you guys tell me if I'm a little bit misguided with this courses and what would you recommend me to start with?\n\nThank you!",
