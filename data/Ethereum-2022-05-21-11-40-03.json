But still, I think that anyone investing in Ethereum should be far from worried.\n\nI won\u2019t be talking about price action as we\u2019ve all seen how consistent it is already. I\u2019ll be talking more about the fundamentals and support that Ethereum has. Ethereum is probably the most reliable out of all chains and will always get the job done at the end of the day.\n\nThis is why I\u2019m not too surprised seeing so many whales buying up ETH like its a running out. Look at Etherscan and check out the top 50 accounts and how much they\u2019re stacking up. Bitdao alone has been adding more than 360 ETH on a DAILY basis and has already accumulated more than 500 million dollars worth of ETH in its treasury.\n\nYou can\u2019t ignore all these whales and giant projects buying up huge amounts of ETH at a difficult time like this one. This makes me feel a lot more relieved about the future of Ethereum as a whole. The support is still there and its actually stronger than ever",
