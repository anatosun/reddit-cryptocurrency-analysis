            "selftext": " \n\nThe past few months have been a rollercoaster ride for Dogecoin, which has seen its price rise more than 5,000% since the beginning of last year. Despite the recent downturn, the price has been steadily rising again.\n\nAn investment like [Dogecoin](https://fxcryptonews.com/?s=Dogecoin) is attractive due to its explosive price increase. But high-return investments are often risky, and Dogecoin is no exception. This may seem more difficult than making a lot of money from this investment, but luckily there is another way to become a millionaire in Dogecoin.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss how much Dogecoin it takes to become a millionaire\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource [https://fxcryptonews.com/how-much-doge-do-i-need-to-become-a-millionaire/](https://fxcryptonews.com/how-much-doge-do-i-need-to-become-a-millionaire/)",
