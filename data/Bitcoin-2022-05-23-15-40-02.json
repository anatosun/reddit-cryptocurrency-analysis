I look at things in views of hundreds of years, and our current humanity has never had it better, due to credit.\n\nI think we we're born during a moment in human history where there is more prosperity than ever and it's easy/common reasoning that monetary systems are why... but dang... SOOOOO much else has happened in the last century that I simply can't attribute it to only credit...\n\nMuch like inflation derives from a enormity of variables ... Human progress and quality of life does too. Arguably there were times and localities in the past that had vast societal abundance/prosperity on harder-money rails than we have today.\n\nIMO, it's important to not conflate- inflation derived from credit VS inflation derived from monetary policy. I don't think any central bankers or states are really thinking about \"paying back\" the \"credit\" when we're talking tens of trillions of dollars (particularly not in the US)\n\nSo maybe we have wild abundance now *in part* due to inflationary monetary policy... but history shows us countless similar examples of fiat failing... it's a few decades of prosperity, primarily for the wealthiest-  then recessions/stagflation/revolutions...\n\nAnyway, rambling now, here's a good vid regarding your war thought- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvchzpbv2hE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvchzpbv2hE)\n\nCheers",

Bitcoin and fiat will live alongside each other, that's what I believe, in the past it was gold standards that do something similar to what Milton Friedman was talking about, which is limiting the inflation of fiat currency by linking it to government gold reserves. I attribute Bitcoin to a better version of Gold, and like Gold it ultimately has a hard limit, even if it takes a very long time to reach that limit. Not only that but people lose Gold, and they lose Bitcoin, so the end game truly is deflationary. \n\nThe fiat currency is always going to be more inflationary, and be what humans continue to use to buy most of their goods and services, if we want a good economy, though, it can't be too inflationary in relation to the real wealth of the people and its country. In this sense the gold/bitcoin standard keeps the currency in check similar to how hard limiting inflation each year also would.",

Perhaps it's with the intention that all things being equal the prices of goods will remain stable as the new supply of money is calibrated to match the growth of the economy. If that's all it is, then Bitcoin being divisible renders that problem trivial. The prices of goods will gradually decline in Bitcoin, but smaller amounts of BTC are just as easy to transact as larger amounts (unlike dollars which are only divisible up to a factor of 100).",
