            "selftext": "I just added just under $3,200 to my USDC wallet from my bank account. I then tried to spend $2,000 on my coinbase card, and was annoyed to see the transaction declined. I checked my coinbase card, and it said my balance was $1,658. That's not right - it was already slightly over $100, and I just added nearly $3,200 more! So I went ahead and spent $1,650 on my coinbase card, only to see my available funds drop to $74, not $8 like one would expect. Now, after doing nothing, I'm at $68.88. Every time I pull down to refresh, my card balance changes a few cents to a few dollars, which of course should not be happening with USDC. \n\nWhat is going on? I called support and was told this needs further escalation and investigation. I don't expect them to figure it out soon enough, as I have to pay the second half of my credit card bill tomorrow. This presents an issue, as there's no way to get the money back to my regular bank account fast enough to pay from there instead. My USDC wallet currently shows a balance just over $1,600, but the available USDC funds on the coinbase card do not reflect that.\n\nHas anyone experienced this problem? Any ideas what happened and how quickly it can be resolved? Thanks in advance for any help.\n\nEdit: I called my credit card company and explained my dilemma. They gave me a full month extra time to pay this bill with no late fees or interest charges. I now understand that I only have to wait until the ACH transfer clears. That will take less than a month obviously. All is well!\n\nEdit 2: Scammers galore in my inbox right now. Please stop. I'm not an idiot. Everyone trying to phish is being reported to reddit and blocked.",

It\u2019ll say how long you have to wait before you can withdraw it.\n\nThe reason your available balance changes slightly is that even though you have to wait to withdraw your funds, you can use your holdings as \u201ccollateral\u201d so basically if you hold $100 in BTC then you will be approved to withdraw that amount early (and since your crypto holdings fluctuate, your \u201ccollateral\u201d fluctuates)",

I have 5 or 6 in a drawer somewhere, and have never used one for so much as a penny.  These things aren't banks.  NOTHING crypto is guaranteed, hence that recent failure of the \"stablecoin\" TerraUSD that plummeted in value under 13 cents in a single day, with it's supporting coin losing nearly 100% thereafter.  You're in the waning days of the wild west for crypto and any investment into any of it could go to zero and you'd be screwed.  The loss of 2 trillion in market value since November is telling enough.  I rode that pony right to the slaughterhouse myself and won't make that mistake again.  Words for the wise?  Find another card to use, lest ye like gamblin your personal credit on hopes and dreams like that commercial....I'm a millionaire!.......I'm not a millionaire?.......",
