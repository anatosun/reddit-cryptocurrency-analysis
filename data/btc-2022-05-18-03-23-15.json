Somehow ETH gets **13 TPS**, while BTC only gets **3 TPS** (even as legal tender + free withdrawals from [FTX](https://ftx.com/)), and BCH only gets **0.6 TPS** (even with [memo.cash](https://memo.cash) & cash usage, etc). Traders can use leverage (long or short) to justify the measly **$0.5 million/day** it'd cost to ~~double~~ (match) the BTC average fee (3.1 TPS with $2/txn). ETH spam costs more (in ETH). It's a bit like justifying a higher Google stock price by looking at emails/second & charging a fee/email (when the fee goes up, traders can use trial & error in varying positions across the board).",
