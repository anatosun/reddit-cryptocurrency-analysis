            "selftext": "Intro:\nHey all, I'm fairly new to this community, Reddit, and the Crypto scene. So I apologize if this post comes off a bit  dumb.\n\n(Edit)\nRemoved Musk theory on currency since responses focused on Musk over ideas to improve Dogecoin.\n\nCommunity Value:\nI was pondering about the definition of value and what that is and how value happens ect. This led me on to how Dogecoin is widely known (nearly a household name now because of Musk and the get-rich-quick schemers trying to ride the gravy train.) And everyone has seen how decent sized coordinated communities are able to make impacts. So my question to this community is, how can this community go about making Dogecoin competitive and more valuable? \n\nA few interdependent points that I found on google:\n1. Increase demand.\n2. Be miner friendly, while the demand increases value to offset miner costs.\n3. Listed on more crypto exchanges. (Musk helped this out)\n4. Beating out competition. This is based of the community.\n5. Internal governance. The coin would need to strike a balance between stability and projects/upgrades.\n6. Regulation and legal. So this is regarding the SEC and the CFTC both claiming crypto belongs in there perspective areas. \n\nClosing: \nDogecoin is the coin of the people; people create value through supply and demand. So what are your thoughts?",

How long would you suppose it might take to create a civilization on Mars? Probably not going to be fully realized in some of our lives? I can definitely tell you it isnt going to be tomorrow.

So I can tell you right now, latency and data isn't an actual excuse... especially not in our near future.  Please research LCRD and TBIRD off of some government sites. Yes, those are all about gig and terabyte infrared laser satellite communications and there are more light to laser data communications coming. \n\nThanks for the post.",

That isn't necessarily going to remain an issue forever and may stop crypto from leave earth in the begining.

I was trying to see how this currency could be improved really regardless of Musk and more via the community.",
