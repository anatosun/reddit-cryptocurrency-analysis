Every contact with Coinbase Custody Customer Support (? 4 or 5 times ever?) has been a positive experience, and even once they fix an issue in my favor (a Stop/Sell failed as a coin continued to climb, instead of forcing the sale at the Stop/Sell price they gave me my coins and cleared the Stop/Sell). Something they didn't have to do for me, and wasn't expected, all I said was \"just clear the order, and return the coins\" and they did... we both knew my Net was going to be higher.",

So get your mirror out and do some self reflection. 65 day holds on ACH deposits is a scam for them to hold you hostage and make returns off your cash for their benefit. Period. Lack of support from Coinbase is the largest issue as agreed by most posts here. Disagree? Then show me the stats. I'm okay with someone disagreeing but you aren't even stating anything of fact. Just trying to argue opinions where my case is factual reasoning. Get a life. You're clearly off balance. Good luck in life.",
