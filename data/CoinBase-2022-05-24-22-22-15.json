Kraken takes a slightly smaller commission (15% vs CB's 25%) so you get slightly higher APY. Better yet, lending on Haru gets you 6.1%APY with no locking or 7.1-14% with anywhere from 15 to 365 days of locking. But when I put most of my ETH on CB they were stating that they were going to enable liquidity of staked ETH by December 2021 which they have since quietly pulled back on. So in that sense they suck. Cheer up though, the merge is likely by August and an EIP allowing staking withdrawals will follow a couple months later so hopefully by October or November things will be liquid again. Either way staking/lending in general is awesome, nothing beats earning free asset and after the merge staking APY is expected to increase to around 12-15%!!",

That way they can\u2019t charge you , they will then feeezs ur CB account and say if you don\u2019t pay they will take ur ETH2.
