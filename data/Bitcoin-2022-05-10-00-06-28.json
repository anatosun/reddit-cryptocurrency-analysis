In turn, this will add up the revenue that might bring in, and it starts to be less of a surprise.\nNote that Fidelity is the country\u2019s largest administrator of 401(k)s, overseeing 23,000 plans. In the plans every pay period, workers plow part of their paycheck and getting a match from their employers. Contribution limits are $20,500 in 2022 with an additional $6,500 for workers over age 50.\nAt the end of 2021, it was discovered that Fidelity administered $2.7 trillion in 401(k) assets. The Boston-based firm said it will let employers add a Bitcoin account to 401(k)s later this year, putting Bitcoin and other decentralize currencies like Flux, Helium, Point Network, etc. on the menu next to mutual funds holding stocks and bonds.\nAlso, Fidelity says it will charge fees between 0.75% and 0.9% for the digital assets account, in addition to undisclosed transaction fees. The company says it will limit Bitcoin to 20% of a 401(k) balance. \nIt was also assumed that a 1% to 5% allocation for investors, could earn Fidelity between $203 million and $1.2 billion in administrative fees from its Bitcoin accounts, not including transaction fees. \nFinally it was predicted that, if 10% of its $2.7 trillion in assets eventually goes into Bitcoin, Fidelity could rake in more than $2 billion in annual administrative fees.",

For example, the US would not face a balance of payments crisis, because their imports are purchased in their own currency. Exorbitant privilege as a concept cannot refer to currencies that have a regional reserve currency role, only to global reserve currencies.

That is a cost basis of $5K.\n\nIf the market tanks (which is amazing by the way cuz cheaper bitcoin) to $40K, sell the 0.1 bitcoin for $4K, then buy it right back. This \"realizes\" or \"harvests\" a loss of $1K (your sale price $4K minus your cost basis $5K). You will incur fees to do this so loss harvesting only makes sense when you have a relatively large loss to lock in.\n\nThere are still no wash sale rules in the US for bitcoin (separate topic) so you can do this as many times as you want.\n\nWhy do this? Because you can later apply your harvested losses against other capital gains on your taxes. So if you own a stock that did really well and want to sell it (to buy bitcoin of course) and not get destroyed by our despicable government on your income taxes, you can offset your gains with your harvested losses and still have exactly the same amount of bitcoin at the end of the day. You can also deduct up to $3K per year against ordinary income. \n\nWhich means more money to buy the dip.",

This is not how things are done, nor the way they should be done. This is propagated by bad memes and by people willing to die waiting for their crypto. \n\nIf you are in profit, you deserve to live prosperously. I see and know people, who held from 2017, are in massive profit, and still won\u2019t sell a little to live. You deserve to live, profits are there to help you make more profits yes, but you have to live the best life you can and stay winning. You don\u2019t even have to sell to do this, as there are now sites that accept crypto directly, such as the case with exeno, a separate commerce platform or for example Binance pay and how it got so popular. \n\nDon\u2019t let others tell you how to live your life. This is not a motivational speech. This is genuine advice. You can\u2019t be out here living like a homeless man, waiting on that next possible pump. This is no way to live.",
