Code could also be introduced to stop all mining rewards, thus effectively shutting down the network entirely. The bottom line is that code can be written to do just about anything, save for wiping your ass (because we all know the three seashells are the best option).\n\nThe problem is that you would need 51% of the network node operators to agree to letting this happen.\n\nHave fun with that obstacle!\n\nEDIT: That's why you hear from folks in the know that as the network grows, it becomes more secure because you then need more and more nodes to agree to do something nefarious. The network effect Bitcoin commands is vastly underestimated by many, many people.",

From what I can tell, Liquid is a side chain that's touted as the premier Bitcoin L2 as it allows for 1 minute block times, confidential transactions, issuance of pegged assets, supports tokens, stable-coins, atomic swaps, and a few other features. That's all great, but the backbone of the network is a federation of large crypto businesses (exchanges, trading desks, etc.) that control block creation/signing and pegging assets into/out of the network.   \n\n\nWhy does the Bitcoin community support such a L2 setup that has companies as the backbone of the side chain? (Honest question, I'm trying to learn and not troll.) Is it because Liquid is not meant for the average user and is mainly focused on facilitating high value transactions between big entities? If that's the case, then I guess it makes sense that only those large businesses can create blocks. I guess the Lightning Network is for everyone else and when decentralization and speed are important.",
