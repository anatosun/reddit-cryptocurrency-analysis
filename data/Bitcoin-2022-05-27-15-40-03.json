Oh the other hand it's not like the vast majority of money in the bank system doesn't actually exist... Plus living out of bitcoin is actually complicated... Look at El Salvador, things are... more problematic than the non coverage of it shows.\n\nOn a personal level, I'd say what stops them is that Bitcoin has value because it is tied to other currencies (even if we don't want that to be the case). As of right now, I'd not say it is a stretch to say Bitcoin is worth a specific (but variable) amount of some other money... You can do more with money than you can do with Bitcoin (there isn't a whole lot we can do with it yet, surprisingly).   \n\n\nImagine this scenario... One million dollars... If you ask people around, do you think they'd rather have it in cash or in bitcoin? If you ask that in here you'll certainly get a lot of people saying they'd rather have the BTC value... But go on the streets, ask 10 people, do the test... I did. I even got answers like ''what is bitcoin''?  \n\n\nI",
