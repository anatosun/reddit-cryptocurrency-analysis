They see Alice spending her 1000 sats, and they all update their internal databases accordingly.All nodes on the network are responsible for validating every transaction that occurs. If Alice (or Bob) attempt to spend the same funds twice, the nodes will check their internal database, they will see that Alice has already spent these 1000 sats, and they will unilaterally reject her second transaction.\n\nIn many ways this process works just the same as trying to spend more money on your debit card than you actually have in your account. The main diference being that the job of checking / validating your balance is being done by a large distributed network of nodes, as opposed to one centralised banking server.",
