            "selftext": "Why do we continue to focus on money inside the crypto space? DeFi has reached a point where there\u2019s an absolute metric shit ton of money flowing through it. Having money doesn\u2019t make you special and you know what the funny part is? Focusing on talent, building a sustainable project with people who know what the hell they\u2019re doing is what\u2019s going to be making you way more money than any get rich scheme. Way more money than the random VC who hit up a round of funding and made some money.\n\nI\u2019d rather get into a proper damn project that has went through hackathons like bitDAO\u2019s latest one over a random pump and dump project any damn day. Even if the former makes me more money in the short term. Money doesn\u2019t mean shit anymore in this space. Since we\u2019re on the topic of DAO\u2019s I think they are the superior way of getting investment for your project, these places become a hub for talent, builders and community. To actually get to that point your project actually needs to be sustainable in the first place. Way too many fools are out here trying to make a quick buck when I\u2019d rather support the long term. Would you rather make some money right now or an absolute metric shit ton of money later? I know what I\u2019m going for.\n\nI'm sorry if my post seems a bit too ranty but I am quite frankly incredibly frustrated at everyone not being able to look past their own noses. Personally to me, the technology is insanely more important than any amount of money out there. The better we focus on building, the more money is going to naturally flow in. Please do correct me if I'm wrong, I'd love to hear it.",
