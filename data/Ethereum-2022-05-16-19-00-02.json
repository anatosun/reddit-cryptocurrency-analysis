But the only one that has the traffic needed to actually stress test most of the system designs, is Ethereum. And with how they are shifting it to become more of a settlement layer than anything else, it seems like we can explore all of these other mechanisms out as a layer 2. As long as we can make sure our consensus is watertight, we should have a system where no single failed experiment doesn't destroy the laboratory.",

It's no surprise to anyone that gas fees, congestion and scalability as a whole are Ethereum's main issues. Eth 2.0 is coming along progressively with the move to PoS and the use of sharding.\n\nWith all of this being said, Vitalik has stated that this sharding execution is going to be taking years. He has also stated that Ethereum is going to be getting progressively more and more complex. Wouldn't this mean we might reach the exact same spot we are in now with Eth 2.0? Assume we were to forgo L2s such as Polygon Hermez among others and strictly use Ethereum. Assuming again that it's going to be getting more and more complex as we edge closer to mass adoption. wouldn't we inevitably end up with congestion and high gas yet again? Effectively bringing us in a full circle, dealing with the same issues Ethereum is dealing with right now.\n\nI may not be the most knowledgeable on this, I believe that Vitalik is more intelligent and knowledgeable than most of us. So if he says that rollups are the future of Ethereum scaling then I'm more inclined to trust him and take his word for it than Randoms on this subreddit. The reason why I am posting this is because I believe that Ethereum is the foundation that these L2s are built upon and these L2s are going to be the bedrock of web3. With all this being said I am open to discussion and debate. I don't claim to know everything about Eth 2.0 and what it's going to mean for Ethereum's limitations. I am open to being educated",

Vitalik said transactions that are over one year old will be dump into decentralized archive system, and transaction that are not that old but considered inactive will also have some special treatment. This will make the chain in operation extremely short, so it should become simpler. But we will need some rules to access archived data, so it depends on how you define complex.\n\nAnyway gas fee has nothing to do with ETH being complex or simple. It is just bandwidth and demand. If bandwidth is 100kb/s, the highest bidder until all 100kb/s were used will decide the gas price. If the bandwidth become 500kb/s, 5 times more bidder will be included, so lower bid will be accepted, which lead to lower gas fee. L2 and sharding both are trying to increase bandwidth by 100 times, so totally 10000 times more bandwidth if successful.",

Enemies are to be distrusted, after all.\n\nI've seen it happen repeatedly with various upgrades as Ethereum developed. People wanted to believe EIP-1559 would reduce gas fees. They wanted to believe that cutting block rewards would directly boost the value of Ether. They wanted to believe that the TheDAO hacker could somehow destroy Ethereum itself with his ill-gotten gains. They believed these things because if it were true it meant they'd get the outcome that they wanted.\n\nI have no idea how to solve this in the general case. I just keep ramming my head against the wall of ignorance, because I guess I believe that'll help in some small way.\n\nOn the plus side, I think it's too late for ignorance to derail the merge. The ignorant will get frustrated that things didn't go like they imagined they were promised it would go, and they'll either learn to cope or move on to something else.

Different apps/ products using the same contract or set of contracts or a \"service\" for their core functionality. This way they get more security of a bigger chain, easier scalability option based on the requirement of the app, up tp date vulnerability fixes etc, etc.  Different apps can customise their specific app based on their requirement.  \n\n\nFor example:  \n\"*A generic social media service\"*  \nAny \"client\" can have a smart contract or a frontend app that can use this service which provide basic functionalities such as messaging, ability to create posts, groups , ability to incentivise participants(users of app) with tokens/ coins. The \"client\" smart contract can create its own coin or rewarding system and rollup it's data on the service chain.  \nThe service chain itself can be a rollup chain to Ethereum. It should also be deployed on various other chains so that the client can choose different scalability/ migration options for their business.   \n\n\nDo we see a future like this of \"API as service\" in the web3 world? Or the classic web2 kind of development where each product deploys its own \"code\" on cloud?",
