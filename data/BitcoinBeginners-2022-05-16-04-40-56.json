Can I send BTC from one exchange\u2019s wallet directly do another exchange\u2019s wallet without the middle step of a cold/hot wallet? \n\nBoth exchanges give me wallet addresses for receiving bitcoin. Is it worth a try? \n\nreasons: I like one exchange better for buying btc but the other exchange has much lower withdrawal fees. So i was thinking of buying btc on exchange A and send them to exchange B and them withdraw them to my wallet.",

So i we thinking of buying byc on exchange A and send them to exchange B and them withdraw them to my wallet.\n\nThis does not make any sense because the act of sending BTC from exchange A to Exchange B is a withdrawal , thus you would be charged 2 withdrawal fees instead of 1 \n\nWhy not just use an exchange with free withdrawals or low withdrawals to begin with ? Have you looked at the chart in the FAQ?",
