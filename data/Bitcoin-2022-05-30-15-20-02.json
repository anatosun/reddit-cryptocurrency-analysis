But nothing of the sort popped out at me.  \n\nStill skeptical, I read it again, the next day, slowly.  Still, I could find no reason why it would not work.  \n\nSo I spent the next few evenings going over the White Paper with a fine-toothed comb.  I even dug into some of the source code.  By then I was convinced and ready to buy.  \n\nSo, it took me about a week of doing a deep dive into the White Paper - not TEN YEARS.",
