However the validator also get's money from people staking on them. To not make it too complex. They get the commission, so for example if you stake and you get 1 BNB in staking rewards and they have 20% commission you'll get 0.8 BNB and the Validator 0.2 BNB.

We\u2019ve probably got weeks or even months of dip left to enjoy.\n\nBut this ain\u2019t advice, and I always choose wrong. Don\u2019t let me shake you out, dca, buy what you won\u2019t miss of it goes down, but spend enough you\u2019ll be happy if it goes up.\n\nThese low prices won\u2019t last forever, I\u2019m trying to load up while I can, everyone panic selling gonna regret it. Just like I regret not loading up after I lost it all in 2018. So stupid, I was scared because I lost thousands and it was all I had. But I should have kept going, I\u2019d be rich right now, even in the dip.\n\nI\u2019m still up over 500% because I started buying in 2017. And I managed to grab a. Couple 10 baggers the last few days on sheer luck. Grabbed bunny at 6$ during the hack, and grabbed stopelon at launch. Woot woot. Didn\u2019t risk much, but they are saving my portfolio. Also went I tried to transfer my uni farm to v3 and they wanted 600$ for the Eth fee, I realized it was time to load matic, got it under 1$",
