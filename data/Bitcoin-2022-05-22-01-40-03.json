[Watch this 16 minute video to learn why hostile nodes don't pose a threat to Bitcoin.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5mi4IVrOoM)\n\n>How does the voting mechanism work? Can every owner of a Bitcoin address vote or only people who run a node?\n\nThere is no voting mechanism. Nodes just get to decide which version of software they want to run. \n\n>Or would it just create another hard fork that most people wouldn't use?\n\nIt would create a hard fork if there was actually any miners willing to mine it.\n\n>how much power does Blockstream really have? What would it take for them to be able to increase the supply for example?\n\nBlockstream can't increase the maximum supply of BTC. Blockstream can't change any of the Bitcoin protocol rules.\n\n>there are only 15000 active Bitcoin nodes\n\nJust FYI - You're only counting listening nodes (full nodes that have port 8333 open). There are closer to 50,000 fully validating Bitcoin nodes operating right now: https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/software.html",

It makes sense that it is simply a different game, no threat to the NBA. \n\nHowever he doesn\u2019t explain something. The attack scenario is as if one day, suddenly, 51% of all basketball games were donkey basketball. Maybe ESPN was in on it and half their shows were showing it now. The average person doesn\u2019t know much about basketball, they just sort of accept whatever and what they see most is the donkey variant. \n\nSo how does the original basketball defend itself?\n\nHe says that regular nodes won\u2019t talk to nodes with a changed rule set. Does that mean they immediately blacklist any node proposing an altered block? That would make it make sense; you can enforce your new consensus but it\u2019s completely isolated.\n\nAnd at that point you would need 51% hashpower as well, otherwise nobody would ever append a new block to your chain.",
