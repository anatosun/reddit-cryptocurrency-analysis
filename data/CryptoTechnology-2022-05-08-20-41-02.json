            "selftext": "According to market research estimates, blockchain technology will witness astounding growth in its market size in the next five years. Between 2020 and 2025, the global blockchain market size is expected to grow at a rate of 67.3% CAGR to reach US$39.7 billion in 2025 from US$3.0 billion in 2020.\u00a0\n\nOne can reasonably presume that this growth will drive innovation and would also require the scaling up of existing platforms. For both of these to happen, the most important role would be that of the developers. While some of the existing languages would be continuously used, some of the innovations would require knowing new languages.\u00a0\n\nOverall, developers and blockchain enthusiasts must remain aware of the benefits and drawbacks of multiple programming languages. This would help them to choose the most appropriate language \u2013 the best fit for their needs.\n\n[Here, in this article, we would look at the top blockchain programming languages and discuss what their qualities are.](https://nownodes.io/blog/top-blockchain-programming-languages/)",

                    "response": "Data availability is a big one. Tracking the whole blockchain takes up a lot of space that still needs to be offloaded using the shard design. There's also issues with blockspace on Ethereum now that are indirectly involved in gas fee issues that severely limit layer-2s ability to do data calls so proto-danksharding and danksharding are looking to solve these through the use of \"blob\" transactions. Neither of these fix the underlying issues but should kick the can down the road a very long ways.\n\nNext is EVM compatibility and silos of resources. Most Ethereum L1 protocols can use existing tooling from Optimism or Arbitrum to migrate to an L2 but this took a substantial amount of effort and preparation, and launching on either isn't 1-1 to launching on another OR. This gets even worse when considering zkRollups which will apparently have a very difficult time achieving EVM parity and are similar to a whole new chain with a custom language. All these separate rollups also separate off developers and improvements for Ethereum as an L1 and are pretty directly in competition with each other for the competent developers who will move to L2s. On a customer side this makes liquidity and TVL splintered and highly dependent on non-Ethereum dependent bridges like Hop, Synapse, or Multichain. This effect will likely end up looking quite similar to the EVM dominated L1 wars recently.\n\nSome issues with Ethereum don't get solved by L2s but get solved by The Merge which is a phased delivery of sharding, rollups, and PoS. And some issues with Ethereum won't be affected at all in a bad way like the high level of dependence on a few entities for infrastructure support like Alchemy, Infura, and Metamask. These weaknesses have been exposed and are being slowly addressed on their own.\n\nL2s also create some issues we didn't really have before. Optimistic rollups currently have a \"weak assumption\" of trust with their whole fraud proof/sequencer setup and a week long return of resources to the main chain due to this setup. ZKrollups lose a lot of transparency with the simple mechanics of validity proofs and how products like Etherscan will be able to understand them supposedly (unsure of this claim), and have  extremely high processing requirements centralizing their creation and utilization somewhat.\n\nAs for the major issues people are looking to address of TPS and gas fees, most implementations are artificially capped right now so accurate numbers are hard to come by as with rollups gas fees should have a weird \"check-mark\" curve as gas will get cheaper until blocks start filling. I think most ORs are in the 5-10k TPS range while zkRollups are theoretically in the 50k range. Most online implementations bring Ethereum to Avalanche/Terra levels of fees on l2fees.com but those are noted to be the expensive L1s right now (Ethereum's fees being the whacky outlier) so most active L1s beat most active L2s on fees/TPS metrics currently though L2s are basically holding their own leash here.\n\nPromising stuff to look into would be Polygon's multiple investments into new L2 teams, Celestia approach to modularity and potentially Sovereign rollups, Aztec Network/Starknet/ZkSync just starting to rev up, whatever Polynya is hyped about currently, Optimism governance and airdrop release, I think it was zkSync hyping L3s, and Metis network or Loopring as dark horse candidates.",

The most popular one is that the subsidy to PoS will increase to 80%, while the subsidy to PoW decreases to 10%.

It has gone down twice (going down in Nakamoto consensus is different than BFT consensus but it's the same for the end-user), been forked and even double spent. The worst you can do in this space is be short-sighted. \n\nWe all want resilient systems but always remember that resilient systems are only born from fragile young systems, otherwise how do you identify the flaws that need to be fixed?",
