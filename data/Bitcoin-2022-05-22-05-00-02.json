It did everything just fine, but when I wanted to transfer my restored funds to an exchange, I realized that while all my purchases were correct, my sells were not. For example, according to BlueWallet, I once sold 0.033xxxxx, when I actually sold 0.027xxxxx BTC. Which can't be true, because not only do I remember calculating exactly how much I wanted to sell, I ALSO have confirmation available from the exchange to which I sold my BTC.\n\nNow, before I assume that BlueWallet is fishy, I wanted to know if there is something I have not considered yet.",

Each unspent transaction output must be spent in full. When you send a transaction, you will receive the remainder back to one of your change addresses. So if you have a UTXO of 0.03300000 BTC and you want to send 0.02700000 BTC, then you will spend the full 0.03300000 BTC UTXO and 0.02700000 will will be sent to the address that you send it to and whatever is leftover after the transaction fee will be sent to a change address that's controlled by the same wallet that you sent the transaction from.",
