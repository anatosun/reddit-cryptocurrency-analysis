You can still view and subscribe to r/Bitcoin, but you won't be able to post or comment.\n\nNote from the moderators:\n\n    First you lied about us \"ghosting your comments.\" Now you're in the Bcash subreddit and lying about being banned. You were not banned. I'm going to go ahead and ban you because you're already telling everyone that we banned you.\n\nIf you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/Bitcoin by replying to this message.\n\nReminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.\n\nthis is the original comment that i made in this here the bcash sub 2 days ago:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ukyvvm/just_had_a_interesting_conversation_with_a/\n\nso it seems they say im lying..but yet that mod did admit they 'removed' 1 of my comments as you can see,but without the modlogs such as this sub has how can anyone know how many comments have been removed if the mods have the power to also put someones comment back which i know they can do in other subs they can remove a comment and then change their mind and put it back,anyways here is 4 from the last 2 months i found just by going through my sent messages i can see when i talk to the mods\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/u2wzac/bitcoin_is_lacking_in_a_ability_to_provide/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/u5o6b2/maximalism_in_mainstream_news_its_time_to_start/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/tginz9/nickel_plunges_as_traders_fume_over_latest_london/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/t2v44r/everyone_says_we_need_easy_and_cheap_markets_for/\n\nso why are the mods removing my talk about bitcoin forking? well it seems more likely now that they or some of them are invested into the paper bitcoin i.o.u's world and if bitcoin was to be dropping 50+ forks a day into the hodlers hands then it make the world of paper bitcoin i.o.u's useless cuz then no one would want to hold paper bitcoin cuz then they would miss out on all of the forks..so thats the most likely reason i can think of of why they dont want me to be talking about bitcoin forks as a good thing..it seems they want to demonize bitcoins forking abilities",

So you can choose the highest yield pair, but keep your collateral in BCH.\n\nFrom what I've seen, impermanent loss (IL) can gobble up yield on AMMs whether the assets go up or down. Any variation increases IL.\nBenefit of AMM+ is you can select increasing, decreasing, or neutral. For example, if you select increasing, there is no impermanent loss when your asset value crosses the upper range on your investment. So you yield farm the whole time the asset is in your range and then you close your position when the asset goes above it.\n\nOther options, use coinflex.com to bridge your BCH to SmartBCH. Send to an dex like mistswap and stake your sBCH to yield farm.\n\nHayden Otto has some videos to get you started.",

Anyone who wants to  spend from it must satisfy the contract, and I designed it so that  ANYONE will be able to satisfy it. First come, first served! :)\n\nThere's a catch, though - the contract uses [Script](https://reference.cash/protocol/blockchain/script) features ([native introspection opcodes](https://gitlab.com/GeneralProtocols/research/chips/-/blob/master/CHIP-2021-02-Add-Native-Introspection-Opcodes.md#chip-2021-02-native-introspection-opcodes) and [OP\\_MUL](https://gitlab.com/GeneralProtocols/research/chips/-/blob/master/CHIP-2021-02-Bigger-Script-Integers.md#technical-specification))  that will only become available when the May 2022 Bitcoin Cash upgrade  will be activated ([countdown](https://cash.coin.dance/)). Because of that, nobody can spend from the address  yet and that gives you a few days of time to figure out how to craft the  spending transaction in anticipation of the upgrade activation.\n\nAnyone is able to do the same, so it will be a race - who will  broadcast the valid spending transaction first and at the right time to  claim the reward?\n\nThe contract redeem script is: `0xc3518876cd00c788cc00c65f956096a269cd3a6a38486170707920426974636f696e2043617368204d61792d32303232207570677261646521202d20626974636f696e6361736861757469737487`\n\nand here's a link to a very useful tool for Script contracts (kudos to /u/bitjson): [https://ide.bitauth.com/](https://ide.bitauth.com/).\n\nI suggest using [Electron Cash](https://electroncash.org/index.html)  to make a dummy TX that sends to your address, export the TX into a  file then edit it in your favorite text editor to replace the input with  the one spending the reward, load it back into Electron Cash and  broadcast!\n\nThe transaction format is documented here: [https://reference.cash/protocol/blockchain/transaction/](https://reference.cash/protocol/blockchain/transaction/)\n\nI will not give any other help - you figure it out, good luck!",
