The divisibility isn\u2019t an issue, it\u2019s the total. When already a large amount of all Bitcoin is held long-term or lost, this creates liquidity issues because less and less of the bitcoin in circulation actually is used for trading. This is fine when there are more buyers than sellers, but creates huge amounts of downward pressure on the price in times of crisis. At some point, if the price continues to fall because of economic factors, you\u2019ll see these whales all rush to exits and Bitcoin will collapse in price.  \nSince there are no cash flows, no dividends, and no physical assets backing Bitcoin, there is no floor at which investors would certainly step in. Because of this, a far higher percentage of the market cap can feasibly be destroyed by supply/demand imbalances. This would\u2019ve happened had the fed not stepped in March 2020 and now the problem is even worse because they did.\n\nI have yet to see a half-intelligent response here to any comments I've made. It's honestly very troubling. Bitcoin is supposed to be \"de-centralized\" but it's already becoming obvious that a collective few (people & entities) pull the strings. Just like there's no true communism in the world, there is also no such thing as a decentralized currency.",
