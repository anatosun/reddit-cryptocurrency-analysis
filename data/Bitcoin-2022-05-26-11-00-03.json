The exact same thing happened with the AIDS epidemic. After its outbreak in the early 80's, a huge amount of research was put into finding a cure for it, at the detriment of many current disease killers of people, because people had become used to the idea that cancer and heart disease just 'naturally' killed people, as if AIDS was some bioterror weapon that was completely different from the natural processes that already killed most people. It turned out we wasted a decade researching a very small killer, while just ignoring what actually killed the majority of people. Only once the panic subsided did we realize that AIDS, while a persistent problem, was never going to be a mass killer, and only then did research priorities return to the most probable threats to human life.",

Its actually not unlike fiat money, in that there always seems to be another catastrophic nuclear accident that was 'totally unexpected' every 10 years or so, and maybe we just can't handle power types that are susceptible to 'black swans', in the same way that fiat money can't be handled prudently, because there is always an unexpected event that requires huge money printing that seems OK to 51 % of the population at that moment, and then we have to deal with rampant inflation for the next 10 years...

Explain proof-of-work first.)\n\nTrust in the network cannot be achieved any other way than by proof-of-work.\n\nProof-of-work allows for anyone to plug in a machine to help process transactions for the network & be rewarded for it. Naturally, high processing power (which requires high energy usage) will increase the machine's usefulness to the network & will therefore increase the rewards paid.\n\nJust as naturally, cheap or free electricity will be sought to increase profitability. Since the machines produce heat, anywhere that heat is required, the machines can literally run for free - e.g. Vancouver, Canada, soon to be the first city in the world to be heated by Bitcoin.\n\n(Let that sink in. ASICs convert 100% of the energy they use into heat. Even if BTC's value became zero in the future, Vancouver's BTC mining infrastructure would continue to provide heat at near 100% energy efficiency. For comparison, natural gas heating provides 92% energy efficiency.)\n\nThe alternative to proof-of-work is proof-of-stake. Proof-of-stake removes the incentive for the public to process transactions for profit by instead giving this opportunity only to the currency's top stakeholders. Only they may apply to be chosen at random & given set contracts to fulfill. Since the amount of work they're permitted to do is limited, their profit does not increase in relation to their processing power (ability to process transactions faster), as it does with proof-of-work currencies.\n\nThe problem with proof-of-stake is clear: the security of the network relies on an elite group of entities with high stakes in the currency. Everyone is forced to trust this group. And, historically & economically, what tends to happen when you remove competition? Corruption, greed & waste.\n\nProof-of-stake requires trust in an elite group to secure the network.\n\nProof-of-work does not, and is therefore the most secure & trustworthy type of network that can exist.\n\nIn summary, Bitcoin's energy usage produces trust (by removing the need for trust) and at the same time, produces heat that can be utilized.\n\n**Edit:** [Those who oppose Bitcoin](https://antibitcoiners.com) after processing the above information may be inherently opposed to (or uncomfortable with) freedom in general or free markets for important things, or they may simply be resistant to change. The first subset may be not be convincable. The second: ask them what the general public likely thought when the first paper money was invented. \"You're telling me this piece of paper is worth a cart of copper coins? I reject the notion!\" <- some guy in the first century, probably.",

This most likely will lead (if it hasn't already) to the more elite to mine as normal people just can't compete with companies mining. \n\nHowever,  the reasons we don't really have to worry about them getting all the rewards  on PoW are pretty smart:\n\n1. The more difficult to mine PoW, the more expensive it is. For PoS, their expenses are virtually non-existant and can compound their stake easily,  while PoW has major expenses forcing them to always be selling some btc and not just riding it out. \n\n2. Which leads to my second point. For PoW,  the coins have no impact on security. So even if miners got tons of coins, it's irrelevant to the security. However for PoS, the coins *are* the security, so the distribution of these coins are **extremely** important for security and decentralisation. What's funny is a very popular PoS coin added a burning mechanism, for users,  which only speeds up the real problem of coin hoarding  and was only done as hopes to raise the price. Not a good look.",

That's not a generalization; it's a fact.\n\nAs far as which methods are \"better\", that depends on what the goal is.\n\nThis post asked how to address questions about Bitcoin's energy consumption & what that energy is producing. When questions like these are being asked, the concern is wastefulness.\n\nFor those who do not see the value in the truly decentralized & trustless network that Bitcoin's energy consumption allows for, learning that the heat produced can be fully utilized with zero waste can help to alleviate these concerns.\n\nPeople concerned about wasted energy are concerned for the environment.\n\nVancouver\u2019s electric \"digital boilers\" (see link I shared above) are expected to prevent the release of 20,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases per megawatt-hour when compared to natural gas. This is due to energy not being lost/wasted in the form of emissions & heat loss to expel those emissions.\n\nMany people consider the potentially higher costs of implementing systems like this to be worth it for the positive environmental impact. Multi-billion-dollar fossil-fuel-burning projects have been axed at near- or full-completion with environmental concerns being considered \"worth\" the financial sacrifice.",

None of the 'Bitcoin is bad because of muh energy' crowd even knows what a flexible base load consumer is, let alone that they can come up with an alternative to bitcoin mining. They come up with things like hydrogen production. You can't just shut down a hydrogen plant within 7 seconds as bitcoin miners are required to do in texas.\r  \n\r  \nThen there is methane gas flaring and venting.

But then you have a problem that you've got a TON of valuable, energy producing capital that mostly goes underutilized. But stick a bitcoin mine on top of that which absorbs any and all excess energy, but can easily be spun down if the local human needs demand electricity, and you alleviate the problem.\n\nYou could do the same thing to move nuclear from just a baseload electricity provider to the only provider, and kill the residual fossil fuel plants that support it and make a locale dependent on external fuel sources. Right now, we need to keep our nuclear production capped at the minimum load consumers demand it. That's because it takes a lot of time to spin nuclear energy generation up and down, on the order of hours, so it can't respond to rapid changes in demand. So, we use fossil fuel plants, mostly natural gas, that can rapidly spin production up and down to respond to changes in the demand curve. But with bitcoin miners, we could over produce nuclear at a steady rate, and the miners would just consume any and all excess.\n\nBitcoin miners WILL be another tool in the electricity management toolbox alongside industrial scale batteries (not just chemical, but various gravity batteries) and grid based energy markets.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\"An invention has to make sense in the world it finishes in, not in the world it started.\"\n\nThis is an issue with the fossil fuel industry pursuing profit at any cost which needs to be addressed by government, NGOs and the industry itself.\n\nUltimately, bitcoin incentivizes green energy production since the cheaper the energy the higher the profits.  With the added bonus that energy is now digital (and therefore easily transferrable without the burden of wires and transportation infrastructure).\n\nAre there going to be speed bumps along the way?  For sure... NONE of us can hold our hands up and say we are living a 100% sustainable lifestyle as yet.  Indeed, there was an environmental cost when you opted to purchase that device you just made that Reddit comment on.\n\nOn a final note, a subtle nod to bitcoin was recently featured in the incredible Earthshot documentary series featuring David Attenborough - a series about how technology can help transform and heal the planet, which was vetted by multiple climate and technology experts.\n\nNeedless to say, if those experts had deemed bitcoin a threat to the environment it would be the very last thing they'd want to associate with a documentary about healing the planet.\n\nTL;DR: Poorly researched fear and panic inducing articles generate far more clicks than well researched scientific journals that paint a much more complex truth...  Understanding where all this leads requires extending our mental map of the world beyond the status quo and looking 10 years into the future if we are to fully grasp how all this will evolve into a positive outcome for people and planet.\u201d",

Apparently the world thinks that this feature is worth the gigantic amount of electricity consumed.\n\nSimilarly, a ledger (blockchain) protected by lots of electricity has a \"cool\" property. It makes it so that the ledger can't be altered or changed, thus making it excellent for use as immutable (unchangeable), non-inflatable money (details as to why requires many hours of study). The world is in the early process of deciding how much this feature is worth.\n\ntl;dr Neither a refrigerator or the bitcoin blockchain produce anything directly useful with the electricity they use, rather they produce a condition where something useful can occur (e.g. extended shelf life for food in fridge, and information that is extremely difficult and expensive to alter in bitcoin blockchain)",

I'd say some energy use and environmental impact is worth keeping every participant on a level and secure playing field especially considering the btc network properly rewards and incentivizes/motivates both power generation and energy use efficiencies exploring both improved and cleaner electricity generation and more power efficient miners.\n\nI'd say the only bad side to PoW is all the wasted ASIC silicon that can't be repurposed or easily/efficiently recycled. The asic ewaste, use of limited natural resources, and manufacturing emissions aren't great but it's also not a problem exclusive to btc (look at the smartphone and computing industry and forced obsolesence etc) and at least to the first point the miners having a secondary usefulness would deteriorate the security aspects of mining as the miners should have a sole function and usefulness and the work the miners do should not have other applications (there's a good thread on here somewhere about why the work btc miners do isn't and should not be used for FAH or other distributed computing projects/research).",

Using this argument is simply pointing out that if you actually understand Bitcoin, its use case and potential, the energy usage is just part and parcel of securing that system.

Also: it is not \"national currency\" in the way you are suggesting. It is simply allowed to be used as legal tender, which is not the same thing. And, of course, almost no vendor accepts it. It's too slow, and it's value can shift drastically just in the time it takes to transact with it. Money you can't spend ain't money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>There is no need to do anything for Bitcoin to be interesting option for billions of people. It's rules do the talking. Everyone who learns how it is better and more fair than fiat will stay orange pilled forever.\n\nAgain: where can you spend it? Where can you pay your taxes in it? Or your rent? Nowhere. That is because BTC has no natural value because it is only a speculative asset. And since there is nothing at all to ground its value--the radical fluctuations are baked in--it can never achieve mass adoption.\n\n>Every new asset class is volatile when it's young. Bitcoin too. It is called Price discovery phase. Volatility will get smaller when the asset grows and matures. \n\nI will be happy to listen to your examples of the \"price discovery\" phase of an asset similar to BTC--how long it lasted and how it finally resolved-- if you think you can prove that you know what **you're** talking about. Otherwise, I think you are just trying to dazzle me with some jargon. Why should I assume that Bitcoin isn't already as \"mature\" as it will get? How can Bitcoin's price settle when the only thing people do is horgul it? (Hoogul? What's that cutsey bullshit term again?)",

Since bitcoin\u2019s power consumption can only continue to explode, the answer is \u201cno\u201d.\n\nWhat we shouldn't indulge is people with opinions about things they clearly don't understand. You clearly don't understand energy markets.\n\nBitcoin already found a niche as an energy sink. It is the only global, mobile modular and flexible base load consumer on this planet. It's a huge environment saving USP.\n\nMaybe I am wrong and you do understand how energy works. In that case please inform us of your realistic and profitable way to eliminate methane venting.\n\nMethane gas flaring and venting is responsible for ca. 2% of global warming. The potential electricity generation of (just the reported) flare gas is 6x what bitcoin currently consumes. Within 5 years every single oil company on the planet will be mining Bitcoin to meet their climate goals;) For small and/or remote drilling sites Bitcoin mining is pretty much T.I.N.A. It will turn Bitcoin into a net negative emission industry. The only net negative industry on this planet.

It is as simple as that. And if Bitcoin is responsible for producing more carbon than it consumes (say, through eating flare gas), and if it is predictable that the effort to acquire the last few yoshis in existence will require the consumption of an ever escalating amount of energy that will not come from windmills and the wagging of puppy dog tails, then Bitcoin must at last be seen as a net negative for humanity in any scenario where reducing the global temperature is critical.",

Or is 'degrowth' your strategy? \n\nHere is another energy issue where 'degrowth' is just a solution if all one cares about is virtue signalling.\n\nRemember when all those Texans froze to death during that cold snap? That's because they built capacity for the good times. Now they are building renewable capacity for the bad times and it is bitcoin miners who consume all the energy in the 99% of times they don't need max capacity. Without bitcoin miners they could not have financed it.\r  \n\r  \nPOW will be vital for the green energy transition because you need flexible baseload consumers to make it economically feasible. None of the 'Bitcoin is bad because of muh energy' crowd even knows what a flexible base load consumer is, let alone that they can come up with an alternative to bitcoin mining. They come up with things like hydrogen production. You can't just shut down a hydrogen plant within seconds as bitcoin miners are required to do in texas.\n\nSurely you have a better solution.",

I mean they hear it in the media and everywhere, could also be pos and we already habe a nice money System etc. Its always Just politics.  Nobody asks to stop Selling or produce Tesla even if most energy isnt green at the moment. But that isnt a Problem of Tesla. The energy Provider have to be pushed,  not bitcoin, to give more green energy. And if nicely done bitcoin could safe all the overproduced energy of for example Wind parks during nights when there is lot less energy need. It would be cheaper and more effective but the people on the top have to See it",

I wonder what streaming an hour of Netflix produced? You can either watch 4 hours of Netflix or you can use the energy to power an electric vehicle for a mile",

There is time for BTC and then there is time for Fiat, or rather USD in particular, no need to hold any other if you can help it.\n\nAgain, it is possible that we are entering a time where holding BTC makes more and more sense, btw. IMO the time to get out was late last last year, early this one.\n\nThe trend would probably reverse soon, if it hasn't already happened. Such subcycles do not last **too** long.",

Especially with the massive QE (aka money printing) that has been going on in recent years and the laughable interest rates hikes to fight the inflation we just have seen from them until now. \n\nHolding also a part of your saving in Bitcoin is a good idea imo.",

Most gift cards (at least the ones I use) come with 0 fees attached, so it's an actual money saver! I get to pay with Bitcoin not just on Amazon, but also when I order takeout! Been using them for years now, and it's great. I'm pretty sure essentially everyone who's been in Bitcoin for a year+ already knows about them, but if you're a newbie and you haven't heard of Bitrefill, make sure to check them out!\n\nNot a paid shill, I just genuinely love their service!",
