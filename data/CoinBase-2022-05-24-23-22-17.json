Coinbase Wallet's in-app trading feature does not support cross-chain conversions (Eth to BTC, BNB to BTC, BTC to DOGE, etc). It can only convert crypto to crypto on the same network. If you wish to convert a token to another on a different network, you may either use a Dapp that supports cross-chain conversions or a bridging service. If the currency and network of your token is supported on an exchange, you can send it to that exchange to convert it, though we don't support tokens on the BSC chain on Coinbase exchange. Let us know if you need any other assistance. Thank you!",
