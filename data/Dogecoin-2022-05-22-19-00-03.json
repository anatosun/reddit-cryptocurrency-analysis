I'm currently using MyDoge until I get a hardware wallet this Fall, and in my wallet there's a feature that allows your wallet to receive funds. Somewhere in that feature should be a QR code and/or an alphanumeric code that you can copy.\n\nI dont know where your Doge is, but if you have a wallet on Robinhood, when you select Doge to view it on RH, there should be a button that says SEND. If you click that and it will prompt you to enter the amount of Doge to send. Currently (at least for me), you can only transfer 5000 Doge at a time, with a network fee surcharge of 0.02 Doge. Then it'll prompt you for the QR code or the code you copied to your clipboard. Either scan or paste the code, confirm it, and wait about 5 to 10 minutes for it to pop up in your wallet. Repeat until all your Doge is off the exchanges. If you are using RH, the max you can transfer in a 24 hour period is 50k Doge, since the max you can transfer is 5k and the max transfers you can do in 24 hours is 10.",
