I think you either get it or you don\u2019t at the moment...I have spoken to various people about it and some people are all for it and it seems you if you aren\u2019t invested in it, it\u2019s a huge grey area of doubt and deception. The people who grate on me the most are the \u201c the pound/dollar has always been around it will never crash \u201c and they are so grounded and ignorant about it. \n\nDoes anyone else come across the close minded people or is it just my circle of friends?\u2026",

They'll end up buying into the next Luna and blaming you for their misfortune. \n\nI have, however, made a point to ask friends what they know about bitcoin, and if they're interested in learning more. Most say no, and for them I drop it and don't bring it up again. But some have said yes and I've helped guide them on getting started.",
