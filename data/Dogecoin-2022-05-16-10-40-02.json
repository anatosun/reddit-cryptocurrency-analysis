The argument not from you but that most people say first when hating Doge is the market cap. what about the us dollar? moron politicians just print more money and eventually we all decided well its ok its still worth 1 dollar in essence.

And another thing about market cap is that, for example, Dogecoin reaches 100$, market cap is unexplainably high, but it doesn't stay the same forever, from the moment the first person sells Dogecoins with the price of 100$, the market cap begins to go down, because the price will go down, so there is no chance that the world will be filled with amount of USD equal to the market cap of Dogecoin. Only of all the people who hold Dogecoin will sell at the same time, and then the market cap will be equal to 0.",
