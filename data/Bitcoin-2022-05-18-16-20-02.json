Not crypto, no alt coins, not youtubers pitching different tokens and chains...learn Bitcoin and learn how the fiat money system works.   \n\n\nDoing this will give you tremendous confidence in BTC and you will not only be fine holing your 50k UTXOs...you will buy more while it's below 50k and be happy and confident about it.",

            "selftext": "Hi, I made a small payment to an online company a few days ago by Bitpay which was never received by the company I paid.  I paid using my Ledger wallet as the source and the Bitpay website.\n\nThe problem seems to stem from the payment not processing (or confirming on the blockchain) before the invoice timed out on Bitpay's side, which took about 10-15 minutes as I recall.  I paid for the transaction to take place at a \"high\" priority to avoid this kind of problem.   Soon after the invoice timed out there was a confirmation that appeared on the blockchain, and it's appearing to confirm again and again at this point as one would expect it to.\n\nThere are at this point over 200 confirmations for the transaction.  The company I paid says they can't find the transaction in their records using the transaction ID I gave them, which is the same one I can view in a blockchain explorer.  I have created a ticket through Bitpay but that's been three days ago now and I have only gotten one notice from Bitpay from when I first created the ticket.\n\nI am posting here in r/Bitcoin as this seems to be the best place for me to start.  There is a r/Bitpay subreddit but it has only 13 members and no activity in months and appears to not be active or official in any way.  My payment was small, like $11 USD, and I have had great experience with Bitpay in the past so I'm inclined to try again, but really payments like these shouldn't \"fail\" and not be recoverable or reversible, even in crypto world.\n\nI am wondering if this may be due in part to the crisis in the crypto markets in the last week, with Bitcoin price's drop and maybe an increase in network congestion, transaction fees, etc.\n\nAnyone else have problems recently with Bitpay or making online payments?  Any suggestions for what I can do with Bitpay not replying to a ticket created for a couple days now besides creating a second ticket?  I don't see a way I can view or edit or add to a ticket I already created, it looks like I have to just wait for an email to come from them -- and I did get one, but only one, when I created my ticket.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nEdit: No, I'm not going to go to some phishing site to \"validate\" my wallet to \"fix\" this.  About 10 minutes ago I got the same message described in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/uro602/found\\_a\\_scammer\\_today\\_trying\\_to\\_steal\\_my\\_bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/uro602/found_a_scammer_today_trying_to_steal_my_bitcoin/)    \nThe problem I described with my payment not processing on the blockchain before the Bitpay invoice timed out has nothing to do with my wallet and I don't need to \"validate\" my wallet by entering my private key on some website to do fix this.   Never give someone or some website your wallet's private key to \"fix\" an issue.  I don't know a lot about crypto but I know that much, and it's worth repeating.",

Only Bitpay understands that txID  \n\nFor some reason your post completely avoids the Bitpay aspect of the transaction. They have a status link for your transaction. That link should display instructions about claiming a refund for a \"paid too late\" transaction, and Bitpay sends email messages  \n\nAlso, the 15-minute deadline is for sending the transaction, not for blockchain confirmation  \n\nContact Bitpay",
