Your funds are safe at Coinbase, just as they\u2019ve always been.  \nWe have no risk of bankruptcy, however we included a new risk factor based on an SEC requirement called SAB 121, which is a newly required disclosure for public companies that hold crypto assets for third parties. https://sec.gov/oca/staff-accounting-bulletin-121  \nWe\u2019re taking further steps to update our user terms such that we offer protections to customers in a black swan event. We also offer a self-custodial wallet solution (Coinbase Wallet) for those who prefer to store their own crypto. Our goal is to make the best custodial and self-custodial solutions in crypto.",
