Now we all have to wait again until exchanges mine some real BCH or till someone make a deposit \ud83d\ude09\n\nIf you do not want to end up as DOGE owners on HitBTC, you should withdraw your coins immediately (if possible). Or at least apply hard the KYE (know your exchange) policy: *Does it have real coins? Does everything work smoothly? Does it make updates? Does it have good customer support? Does it care about safety?* ...\n\n*EDIT2:*\n\n **Crypto.com** [tweet](https://twitter.com/popeyejr12/status/1525076288284659712)\n\n > *@cryptocomcs hello I'm trying to withdrawal some of my bch to an external wallet but when going thru my 2fa it says 17hrs to receive a text message with a code what's going on???*",
