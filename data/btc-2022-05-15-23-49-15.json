When I try to view the transaction on the block explorer it says that it can't be found. Is this normal and do I just have to wait longer? I thought that I should be able to at least view the pending transaction on the block explorer?

Right now it seems only known to your wallet.\n\nIn previous similar cases, the Bitcoin.com wallet devs have posted instructions in this sub on what information they would need from a wallet user like yourself, in order to fix the problem.\n\nSee here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/lier4e/bitcoincom_wallet_sharable_link_bug_unable_to/gn2s4ow/\n\nI suggest you contact Bitcoin.com wallet support and ask them to help you find out what went wrong with sending the transaction. They should be able to help you get the problem sorted out.\n\n> I thought that I should be able to at least view the pending transaction on the block explorer? \n\nThis only works for transactions that have been successfully broadcast to the network.",

FYI the transaction was actually a received transaction so it seems that it should be known to at least one other wallet? Also, the transaction was a prize by scanning a QR code on the Satoshi Angels livestream yesterday (which I assume is a shareable link?).",

Or something like that. I guess their Support staff would be able to know.",
