P2e's have emerged as the new rescuer of crypto as it gives the user an opportunity to earn during dips. Projects like Polker, Honeyland and Axie will play a big role in reviving this industry through radical innovations.",

I held a short bitcoin position on wowswap with 5x leverage from the 40k level and made a few thousand on it, but I'm still positive about the crypto market. I see great entry points to accumulate assets for long term holding",
