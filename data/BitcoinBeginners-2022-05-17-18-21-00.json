Its just not as good for privacy if you keep using the same address multiple times \n\n>Also, how come Casa doesn't have a subreddit? \n\nLooks like they do \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/casanode/\n\n>It also doesn't have a single review on trustpilot.\n\nBitcoin has hundreds of wallets , an most don't have reviews on trustpilot , trustpilot isn't the best source for verifying a wallet \n\nYou should use better sources like \n\nhttps://walletscrutiny.com/",
