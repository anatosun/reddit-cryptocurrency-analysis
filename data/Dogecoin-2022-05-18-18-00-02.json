So the price will need to increase by more than 5% just to break even.  This seems kind of insane to me and discourages me from investing.  They also charge additional fees if you want to sell your investment and convert back to the original currency so this means any investment starts off with a loss of around 10-20% regardless of whatever the market is doing.  \n\nAny thoughts?\n\nWhen I invest in stocks, there are no transaction fees.",

MyDoge Wallet is a Trusted hot wallet funded and designed by Bill Lee (West Coast Bill) and a few other founders and investors with cool backgrounds. \n\nThe Dogecoin Foundation,  the developers, MishaBoar, Billy Marcus, and many trusted Shibes used the MyDogeWallet app. \n\nBasically,  the goal and point of this is to move all Dogecoin off of exchanges and out of lenders hands.",
