I\u2019ve been told once I\u2019ve aquired Bitcoin through and app such as Shakepay. I need to move it into a wallet. Can someone give me a dumbed down version of what wallet to use, why it\u2019s important and how it all works.",

It\u2019s basically an external hard drive to store your coins on offline to keep them safe. Nano ledger S or X are cheaper and also pretty user friendly. Just get your coins off the exchange so you own them",
