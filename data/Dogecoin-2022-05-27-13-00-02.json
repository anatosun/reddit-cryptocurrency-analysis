You get 2 people to put in $100, they get 2 people to put in $100 and so on until you have 16 people under you and you collect $1600. Then they throw a party when that person gets their $1600 so everybody can see the gains. Only the first 2-3 people get any money because the pyramid falls apart quickly when people realize it is a scam. That's the crypto market. First two booms were a result of people investing because they saw other people making stupid profits. They had no understanding of the hustle. Now people are aware that crypto is a scam so the whole pyramid is starting to fall apart. There will not be another boom.\n\nLook at NFTs. That crash is gonna be painful.",
