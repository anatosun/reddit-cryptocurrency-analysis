This address is still #4 on the [Dogecoin Rich List](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-dogecoin-addresses.html), acting as a \"hot wallet\" for Robinhood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**July 16, 2018**\n\n**Robinhood Crypto** [**officially launches Dogecoin trading**](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2018/7/15/dogecoin-is-now-on-robinhood-crypto)\n\nUnderstand that RH Crypto is not a real exchange (with real customer crypto deposits & withdrawals), but rather an ETF-like structure, designed to accommodate capital inflows/outflows at NAV, without (in theory!) moving the price of the underlying asset.  On the 1st day of DOGE trading launch, there are no sellers, only buyers, and Robinhood has to issue \"shares\" of Dogecoin on their front-end, while rapidly procuring collateral Dogecoin to meet demand from new investors. That's why you see accumulation of 500M DOGE on the 1st day, and further accumulation of over 5 Billion DOGE in the next 2 months, with very few outflows.\n\n**The launch is hugely successful, and there's great demand for Dogecoin among Robinhooders :-)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**September 5, 2018**\n\nRH Crypto abandons the use of DQA5 address as Cold Storage, preferring to use it as a Hot Wallet instead to procure/sell DOGE with large counterparties, such as OTC desks and other exchanges.\n\nMajority of funds (over 4 Billion DOGE) are moved to a new Cold Storage [address DMzY](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/address/DMzYxf7ZbQXsyZjr7w9rDKn8KXBkzfsgBQ) in 2 transactions in blocks [2377510](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/block/2377510/DQA5h47M4NdTt2mKDj4nP2VNZWczZi42RY) and [2377511](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/block/2377511/DQA5h47M4NdTt2mKDj4nP2VNZWczZi42RY).\n\nNotice that the DMzY address is prepared for cold storage 2 weeks in advance, just like the DQA5. **Corporate Consistency!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**February 5, 2019**\n\n**The Billionaire Dogecoin Whale** [DH5 address is created](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/address/DH5yaieqoZN36fDVciNyRueRGvGLR3mr7L-full) ...\n\nand starts being prepared to serve as the new, **now permanent Cold Storage** by the RH Crypto team.\n\nExact same prep as the DQA5 and DMzY addresses, but this time it only takes 1 week instead of the usual 2 weeks. **Corporate Efficiency!**\n\nMeanwhile, DMzY still sees its holdings grow to **over 9 Billion DOGE**, peaking on February 7.\n\nIt is abandoned as cold storage less than a week later...\n\nAnd guess where ALL that money goes? If you guessed the DH5, surprise you guessed correctly!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**February 12 & 13, 2019**\n\n**RH Crypto finally transitions to its present-day Cold Storage wallet at DH5**, moving all 9 Billion DOGE from DMzY in 4 transactions: [2598588](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/block/2598588/DMzYxf7ZbQXsyZjr7w9rDKn8KXBkzfsgBQ) , [2600030](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/block/2600030/DMzYxf7ZbQXsyZjr7w9rDKn8KXBkzfsgBQ), [2600057](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/block/2600057/DMzYxf7ZbQXsyZjr7w9rDKn8KXBkzfsgBQ), [2600118](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/block/2600118/DMzYxf7ZbQXsyZjr7w9rDKn8KXBkzfsgBQ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**February 2019 - December 2020**\n\n**DH5 continues its uneventful corporate life** as a dusty Cold Wallet, occasionally interacting with the DQA5 Robinhood Hot Wallet due to normal ebbs and flows of market demand... Reaching 20 Billion DOGE by November of 2020, **just as the most insane crypto bull market in history is about to begin...**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**December 20, 2020:**\n\n**Elon Musks's famous** \"**One word: Doge**\" [tweet](https://twitter.com/ElonMusk/status/1340590280848908288) marks a historic turning point in Dogecoin's evolution as an investment asset.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**December 22, 2020**\n\nDH5 has an influx of over 2 Billion DOGE in 1 day, increasing cold storage size over 10%.\n\nThe pace of accumulation radically changes, **increasing at 10X pace over the next 6 weeks** compared to the previous 2 years.\n\n**Elon Musk loves Dogecoin, and Robinhooders love Elon Musk!**\n\nAlso note the absense of any withdrawals since this date. This indicates a continuous inflow of capital into Robinhood Crypto, despite the WallStreetBets GME fiasco in late January.\n\n**The Bitcoin bull market lifts all boats))**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusions**:\n\n**1.** No, Elon Musk is not the Dogecoin Billionaire Whale, ***Robinhood Crypto*** is.\n\nBut **Elon is still our ex-CEO** and the biggest fan of #DogeArmy ever!\n\n**2**. **Robinhood Crypto has over 30% of all outstanding DOGE supply** between their Hot and Cold wallets. This can either make you **terrified** (possibility of short-term price crashes) or **excited** (if you consider the massive financial buying power of millions of Robinhooders, eg. [this young lady selling her Tesla shares to buy Dogecoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwDtL2tl9Dk&t=2s)). I'm personally on the fence on this one.\n\n**3**. According to my analysis and calculations of Top 13 addresses, the **real Dogecoin Whales account for less than 20% of Top-13 supply, and less than 10% of all Doge supply**:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1\\_1e3rBoWz7psSVIx-fXfIqGGfu7AUsHd0mwIG4mudaI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_1e3rBoWz7psSVIx-fXfIqGGfu7AUsHd0mwIG4mudaI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**So can Elon Musk stop the** [**Over-Concentration FUD**](https://twitter.com/ElonMusk/status/1361094185412100096) **please?**\n\nDOGE is no more concentrated than TSLA share ownership!\n\nCan some higher-ups page him this info plz? **Mods**?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TODO**:\n\n**Need to do more research on EFT-like structures** in traditional financial markets and their limitations. Robinhood essentially game-ifies markets, and we can only guess what's actually going on under the \"hood\".  Because they won't tell us, **we have to reverse-engineer** their mechanisms to analyze implications. Can RH insiders shed some light on their back-end architecture plz?\n\nI have little doubt that malfunctions at Robinhood contributed to, if not caused the **800% DOGE price spike on Jan. 28th**, forcing them to temporarily disable buying of DOGE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Personal Disclaimer**: I am a proud Dogecoin HODLer and Adopter (not through Robinhood).\n\nThis investigation is a personal project with no ulterior motives and no \"insider\" trading involved.",

Or, just imagine for a moment that for some reason Dogecoin hits a nerve with some regulators and RH is forced to remove or reduce transactions against it - what would happen then?\n\nRobin Hood, if possible in your state, should be avoided until they provide you with direct withdrawals to your private wallets",

I've seen many people comment on VPNs, but don't suggest trading apps/wallets and VPN's at all. This is #1 reason why there's so many of us stuck with RH. We have a huge lack of info as to what our options are outside of RH. I've tried many apps and they all exclude my state. Many thanks to anyone who cares to suggest VPN's/Apps for us who are stuck in the gutter.",

So you'll need some other crypto to buy Dogecoin. But Bitcoin is easier to get without KYC. But how you do it will depend on where you live and how you want to buy. I like the website (NOT THE PHONE APP!) for libertyx.com as it only asks for a name and maybe phone number for moderate amounts per week. (I think $500?)\n\nThere's also, obviously /r/dogemarket and /r/bitmarket for peer-to-peer trading, which is how cryptos are really supposed to work.",

I only have 1 award that I was given for signing up, and you get it my friend. The next step in this saga is that we **ALL** need to band together, and **SPAM** Robinhood on a daily basis to make the crypto accessible to the individuals who put money into it. If a million people do this **EVERY DAY**, it will be hard for them to ignore a million social media messages on a daily basis. Thank you!",

                    "response": "~~PSA Robinhood has shared with me in support correspondence that they are essentially tied up with opening an exchange wallet and having robinhood gains be used for illegal financial transactions (LOL)~~\n\n~~I think there is a way for them to work around it if they just allowed a temp DOGE vault in the app for cold storage at the very least... and adopted the USDC stable coin, HODLS can safely cold storage in app until heat dies down, and gainers can funnel the doge crypto into USDC only and back to real USD.~~\n\n~~Robinhood just needs to let you HOLD it (for real) and it\u2019s invisible to the IRS if you hold forever.~~\n\n~~The best thing they can do is let us have cold storage now, and then fix and outbound exit later, but chances are if they attempted this everyone would screech how evil they are cause you can\u2019t send it to your own wallet, instead of just cooperating for the bigger picture.~~\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIve learned some new information that has changed my stance on waiting on robbinhood to see if they will make an exchange...\n\nConsider removing all assets off Robinhood, and getting on a crypto exchange. I recommend Coinbase, as a user since 2013. \n\nRobinhood will create TWO taxable events for you if they end up letting you change the doge into crypto, meaning the IRS will know both the amount of USD you earned up until you \"converted\". Gains that once never existed will appear to the IRS as income momentarily during the conversion so they will know you have X amount of DOGE at x USD value despite buying in at 3 cents or whatever. \n\nOn a normal exchange with crypto, there is only one Taxable event: when you sell. Robinhood won't be able to get out of this without a paper trail for the IRS so if you care about that Robinhood Is truly a dead man walking, otherwise if you don't care about reporting all the gains you might get from your robinhood DOGE mooning than I suppose your fine at the end of this if robinhood opens crypto exchange on the app.",
