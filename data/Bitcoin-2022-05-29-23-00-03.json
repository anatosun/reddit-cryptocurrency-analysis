The objective is to generate an income for the building's operations, allowing it to cover the cost of the edifice's maintenance and upkeep.

Trump was great for America in that way, his ignorance exposing the complete folly of political prestige, which up until that time, was an iron curtain they guarded quite deftly. Bush was a war criminal, destabilizing the Middle-East, printing us into a two-decade war, killing millions of people, and super charged the surveillance state. Obama was a nightmare, bailing out banks, empowering Wall Street, printing us into oblivion, invading Libya, droning the shit out of who knows how many civilians. Trump printed non-stop, had no solutions for anything, got the supply chain disaster started in earnest with his Chinese tariffs, complained 24/7, enriched his own family, printed some more, bashed bitcoin, and cost us a fortune by proffering no common ground. Biden printed us into oblivion, fucked around in Ukraine with his lying son, and is busy overseeing hyperinflation of the US dollar with disastrous sanctions, and no concept of the global economy. Not one of these fuckers ever did a damn thing that was good for America long-term, only what helped them or their party image in the daily news cycle, and at the very longest, in the next election.",

Just a bunch of computers that make sure the transactions are logged perpetually into the ledger (database). \n\nON HOW IT DOES IT\n\nSending money from one place to the other, works more or less like a bank but faster. \n\nYou have an address (think as the Account number you have with the bank) and a then your Passphrase (think as the PIN Number you use at your ATM). You also have the Address of the other party you want to send the money to. \n\nYou input their Address and how much money you want to send. When you hit send, your transaction goes to the Mempool where transactions wait until they are picked up by a miner. \n\nTransactions are then put into a block by different miners. Every miner has a slightly different block that is still not valid. They have around 10 min to find a random number by hashing (scrambling) the information of the block. Depending on the difficulty level, the Hash has o have a certain amount of zeros in front. As hashing is a random process, the computers basically have to \"guess\" that number that starts with a certain amount of zeros by changing a number inside the block. That number is called a Nonce. \n\nOnce you guessed the number with certain zeros in front, you sent that block to all the nodes. They certify that your block has the right amount of zeros in front, when hashed by a system called sha-256 (this always brings the same number if you input the same info). \n\nOnce ALL the nodes certify your block as valid, a new block is formed in the Bitcoin Blockchain. As a result of your effort (Proof of Work) you are awarded Fees + Block Rewards (at this epoch 6.25 BTC).\n\nThere will only be a little less than 21 million bitcoins. You can't create more bitcoins. And that's where the value is. \n\nThe rules can't be changed unless every node agrees. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a very aerial description with a lot of simplification but I think that I would explain it more or less like this to people. I hope it helps.",

(I would definitely want some) Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.\n\nI think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value. But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something.",
