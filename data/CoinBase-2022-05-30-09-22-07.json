We apologize for the inconvenience.\n\n I have made many purchases through CB on mobile and website. This is the first time in all of these years i have had an issue.\n\nI have submitted a ticket but i am getting an email response that the ticket is closed for  \n\nCase #12016867\n\nI would love to be able to correct any issue if necessary. I still have access to my account and pro account.\n\nI have NOT had any chargebacks and I have been using CB since 2017. My bank info hasn't changed and all of my information is up to date and verified. \n\nI haven't seen any suspicious activity either. I don't understand why my buying/selling is currently disabled. Can a support member please help me?\n\nHas anyone else recently experienced this out of nowhere?  \n\n\nThanks for taking the time to respond and help me with my case.",
