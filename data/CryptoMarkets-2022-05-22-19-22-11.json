That\u2019s why the FDIC exists in the US. Before the government decided to create an institution to cover customer deposit losses (through bond issuance and ultimately money-printing), customers just lost their money whenever a bank failed and they didn\u2019t have enough capital to cover all the deposits. That\u2019s just the nature of a financial institution.\n\nStock brokerages are slightly different in the sense that they don\u2019t lend your money out. They make money on trading fees and other services. But they still have issues with liquidity that can complicate that a little bit.\n\nThis is especially true in crypto markets. If you\u2019re Binance.US, and you have millions of customers making millions of trades every day, then you can send a million Ethereum transactions individually. Instead, you have your own liquidity pool of Ethereum that you earmark for specific accounts, and when people withdraw their Ethereum or trade it, then they allocate it (on paper) back to the liquidity pool.\n\nThis is totally fine most of the time, but in periods of high volatility and high transaction throughput, they can find themselves in a position where their total asset value is less than the total value of their user accounts on paper. And at some point they have to make up the difference out of their own profits.\n\nIn an extreme case, they might hit a situation where they cannot possibly cover the deposits.",

And after the problems people had with Cosmos, Solana, and many others.\n\nI think scaling optimistically will have a few issues, Optimism in its current state might get too expensive once serious activity hits the chain. So for the most part, I think ZK-Proofs will be the next big thing. Starknet and ZKSync sound extremely exciting, but I think the future will lean more towards L1s that have ZK-Proofs built in them. Polygon and Concordium are working towards this at the moment, but Polygon is yet to transition into its own L1 with the fear of a community turning against them for betraying the ETH maxis they\u2019re siding with by choosing Ethereum as the settlement layer.\n\nAs this bear market hits, take the opportunity to see what\u2019s being in the works. Your voice as a community member in crypto matters; don\u2019t cheer for the earliest ICO date if the project sounds cool, demand more development, and most importantly, demand ultimate scalability so that your investment doesn\u2019t go from long to short term.",
