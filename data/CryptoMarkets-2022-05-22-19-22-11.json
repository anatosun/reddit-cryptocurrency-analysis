            "selftext": "It\u2019s really frustrating to promise mass adoption on-chain then make people wait 8 hours for either stuck or failed transactions as soon as a good NFT project is minting or when a P2E gains wide popularity. And after the problems people had with Cosmos, Solana, and many others.\n\nI think scaling optimistically will have a few issues, Optimism in its current state might get too expensive once serious activity hits the chain. So for the most part, I think ZK-Proofs will be the next big thing. Starknet and ZKSync sound extremely exciting, but I think the future will lean more towards L1s that have ZK-Proofs built in them. Polygon and Concordium are working towards this at the moment, but Polygon is yet to transition into its own L1 with the fear of a community turning against them for betraying the ETH maxis they\u2019re siding with by choosing Ethereum as the settlement layer.\n\nAs this bear market hits, take the opportunity to see what\u2019s being in the works. Your voice as a community member in crypto matters; don\u2019t cheer for the earliest ICO date if the project sounds cool, demand more development, and most importantly, demand ultimate scalability so that your investment doesn\u2019t go from long to short term.",
