Why is it that Optimism and Arbitrum can be added to Metamask as separate networks while Immutable X and Loopring users simply have to connect to Ethereum mainnet?\n\n3. What are the gas fees on Arbitrum and Optimism currently like when transacting with them on NFT marketplaces? Cents, fraction of a cent, 1-2 dollars, 5+ dollars?\n\n4. What bridge service do most people use to move Polygon & BSC assets to ---> Arbitrum & Optimism?\n\n5. Is there a bridge service that can move from Immutable X & Loopring to ---> Arbitrum & Optimism?",

Arb/OP support the full EVM and function just like mainnet Ethereum, the others are application-specific rollups and work a lot differently. \n\n3. About a dollar, give or take. \n\n4. Hop, Orbiter, Connext, Synapse, lots of others. I think transferto.xyz aggregates most of them. \n\n5. Orbiter will do this. https://app.orbiter.finance/",

You've been very helpful so far.\n\nLast question...\n\nHow does a lay person who can't read code verify that these small, relatively new, or up-and-coming DeFi/bridges like transferto.xyz or orbiter.finance are safe to use? I'm quite scared of giving any of them spend approval.",
