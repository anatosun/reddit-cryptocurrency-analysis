                    "response": "Ultimately the number doesn't matter too much as the market will price in the supply and demand. What matters is the fact that there is a limit, there is scarcity that is open , predictable , and agreed upon beforehand and not manipulated by corrupt Central planners like fiat or some altcoins (even popular ones) do.\n\nSince Bitcoin is extremely divisible (13 decimal places i a payment channel) the total amount doesn't matter because even if Bitcoin is worth 100 million a coin you can still have enough divisibility to buy a cup of coffee. \n\n**There is plenty of parts to go around** \n\nDivisibility is not the same thing as increased inflation either as 1 usd = 4 quarters = 10 dimes = 100 pennies with purchasing power and inflation only occurs when another dollar is printed to drive down the spending power of each dollar.\n\nNow onto why \"21 million\" and more importantly the controlled disinflationary monetary policy exists\n\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply\n\n1) Bitcoin was designed to mimic gold where a limited amount was available and could not be arbitrarily adjusted by corrupt central planners \n\nhttps://fee.org/articles/the-cantillon-effect-because-of-inflation-we-re-financing-the-financiers/\n\n2) It was designed where you can opt in to a economic policy voluntarily that would not change at whim against your will \n\n\nSome educated guesses why satoshi chose 21 million-\n\n1) One theory is that at the time of Satoshi\u2019s decision to use 21 million as the finite number of Bitcoin, the global M1 money supply stood at approximately $21 trillion. In economics, this is the global money supply that includes physical currency and coins, demand deposits, traveler's checks, other checkable deposits\n\n2) \u201cI wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that\u2019s very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle,\u201d Nakamoto said. \u201cIf Bitcoin remains a small niche,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019ll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there\u2019s only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit.\u201d\n\n3) Some believe that Bitcoin\u2018s 21 million limit was arbitrarily set by Nakamoto when he made two key decisions. That Bitcoin should add new blocks to its blockchain every 10 minutes (on average) and that the reward paid to miners halves every 210,000 blocks \u2013 roughly every 4 years.\n\n4) \"A total of 174,100 tonnes of gold have been mined in human history, according to GFMS as of 2012.2 This is roughly equivalent to 5.6 billion troy ounces or, in terms of volume, about 9261 m3, or a cube 21.0 m on a side.\"\n\n5) 50x210,000(1+1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16....) or\n\n50*210,000(2) = 21,000,000 is a nice clean equation to code and mathematically concise\n\n6) It helps avoid errors on most computer systems, and, is likely sufficient for all possible transactions everywhere.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@cseberino/why-21-million-bitcoins-was-a-great-idea-bd2533af0f63\n\n7) The meaning of life is 42 and bitcoin is half this",
