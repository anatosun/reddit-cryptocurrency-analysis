Prior top this date btc was pumped to over $19,500. The (big, smarter, coordinated) money bought up btc in a big way to add to the pump and then started dumping it, at the same time the Futures markets were opening up. They were able to short the market with leverage in a regulated way for the first time.  Go look at the charts around Dec 2017. You will see the the dates coincide....Attack on price Yes. Attack on network, No.",

They ask their ISP to block all ip address that the bitcoin network uses.  Regulated exchanges have to follow, unregulated exchanges get ip blocked.   \n\nWouldn't that count as an attack on bitcoin network? It wouldn't be successful as to shut bitcoin down. But it would remove bitcoin network access to 99% of the first world.",

Additionally it\u2019s \u201cmiraculous conception\u201d is amazing and eerily related to Biblely stuff. It\u2019s finitude is the only thing like it. There is no other provable thing that is finite. If God is immutable and infinite, we humans have created the immutable finite.\n\nAs it stands now, Bitcoin is for the people, but when the global economy collapses and all assets are moved onto the network, which I believe they will be, there will be the implementation of protocols like bip 119 that turn the entire thing into a monetary trap.
