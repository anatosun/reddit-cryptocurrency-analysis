That doesn't make sense. If you have coins in a hardware wallet:\n\nOption 1 is: send coins to the seller for 1x a transaction fee.\n\nOption 2 is: send coins to coinbase for 1x a transaction fee, convert to fiat and pay coinbase a 0.5% fee, then send dollars to the seller.\n\nIn both cases you're paying a transction fee. But if you're selling your bitcoin, you also lose in exchange costs.. I still think it would have both been cheaper for you and better for bitcoin to pay in bitcoin directly.",
