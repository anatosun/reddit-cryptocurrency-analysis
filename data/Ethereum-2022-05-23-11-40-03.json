            "selftext": "I understand the fact that Ethereum is the second most popular cryptocurrency and that it has incredible potential for further growth as well, but I'm curious about Ethereum's blockchain. One thing that's not so clear to me, is why are most NFTs on Ethereum?  \n\n\nI know that ETH is not the only way to buy NFTs, but why are so many people interested in minting NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain?  \n\n\nWe have like dozens of marketplaces, Rarible, OpenSea, and Nifty Gateway are three popular Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces. It's obvious that the high volume of network traffic causes a significant transaction backlog, leading to a substantial increase in transaction fees. Could in that case help L2 solutions, Metis, or something similar?  \n\n\nIn such situation, how do you deal with rising gas prices? On a good day, I've heard that you'll pay between $10 and $40 each transaction. I'd think that's a cheap cost for creating an NFT. However, on a typical day, it may cost as much as $100-150 dollars. Is that correct?  \n\n\nI'm aware that people are making NFTs on Ethereum's blockchain because of its highly-secure network, the Ethereum blockchain leads the DeFi market, with the bulk of NFT projects running on it, but why would some average artist (I'm not referring to famous NFT collections) mint their NFT on Ethereum and risk to pay huge amount of money when he/she may do that as well on Solana for example? Is the transaction speed on Ethereum faster?",

Eventually, we all know that L2s and bridges will be where this stuff is actually done. But we don't know which blockchain or L2.\n\nFYI: I'm pretty sure it isn't going to be Solana. Solana's high transaction speed means that it has insane storage problems, and a digital storage shortage (which looks inevitable) will probably make the blockchain unusable. \n\nThe place which every L2 and cross-chain bridge will have to lead to is the base layer of Ethereum. So you are guaranteed that if you buy on Ethereum, you can wait until the ecosystem matures and then move your NFT wherever you want. \n\nI still wouldn't be caught dead buying most NFTs, but there is a method to the madness.",

Their favourite NFT project only exists on one chain, so they don't have a choice.\n\nIf they already used one blockchain, they are familiar with stuff like which wallet they use, what are the important websites, tools, quirks... going to another blockchain will require them to learn much of this AGAIN, install stuff, read whitepapers and finally TRUST another system. People are lazy, so aside from a few tech nerds, many people will stick to their choice if possible. If they talk about blockchains, they will advertise \"their\" blockchain.\n\nProjects are more likely to examine multiple blockchains, because the success of their project depends on the correct choice. If there are no specific requirements to the underlying tech or tokenomics (think of time to finalize a transaction or transaction costs have to fulfill certain criteria for the application to be viable), then it is almost a no-brainer to choose the most popular chain, since your project will reach the biggest audience. also they have to find enough developers.\n\nDevelopers have to make a big time commitment when they choose for which system they develop, since they have to learn a tech as well, together with tools, programming languages... They are also more likely to choose a popular blockchain, so they will always find popular projects to work for.\n\nPopular blockchains will have more information available on the internet and get more media coverage, so people unaffiliated with any blockchain will most likely get in touch with one of the biggest ones.\n\nThe sum of all this is the so-called \"network effect\" and means that success comes with more success. This can overcompensate drawbacks a specific blockchain may have.\n\nEthereum was the first popular smart contract platform, the \"invention\" of NFT happened there. You have the most projects and users there, that's why it is used even more.\n\nAnd this is also the reason why Bitcoin is still the biggest crypto.",
