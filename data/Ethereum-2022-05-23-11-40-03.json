One thing that's not so clear to me, is why are most NFTs on Ethereum?  \n\n\nI know that ETH is not the only way to buy NFTs, but why are so many people interested in minting NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain?  \n\n\nWe have like dozens of marketplaces, Rarible, OpenSea, and Nifty Gateway are three popular Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces. It's obvious that the high volume of network traffic causes a significant transaction backlog, leading to a substantial increase in transaction fees. Could in that case help L2 solutions, Metis, or something similar?  \n\n\nIn such situation, how do you deal with rising gas prices? On a good day, I've heard that you'll pay between $10 and $40 each transaction. I'd think that's a cheap cost for creating an NFT. However, on a typical day, it may cost as much as $100-150 dollars. Is that correct?  \n\n\nI'm aware that people are making NFTs on Ethereum's blockchain because of its highly-secure network, the Ethereum blockchain leads the DeFi market, with the bulk of NFT projects running on it, but why would some average artist (I'm not referring to famous NFT collections) mint their NFT on Ethereum and risk to pay huge amount of money when he/she may do that as well on Solana for example? Is the transaction speed on Ethereum faster?",

Eventually, we all know that L2s and bridges will be where this stuff is actually done. But we don't know which blockchain or L2.\n\nFYI: I'm pretty sure it isn't going to be Solana. Solana's high transaction speed means that it has insane storage problems, and a digital storage shortage (which looks inevitable) will probably make the blockchain unusable. \n\nThe place which every L2 and cross-chain bridge will have to lead to is the base layer of Ethereum. So you are guaranteed that if you buy on Ethereum, you can wait until the ecosystem matures and then move your NFT wherever you want. \n\nI still wouldn't be caught dead buying most NFTs, but there is a method to the madness.",
