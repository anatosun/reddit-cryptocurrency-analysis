Weird if comparing to previous cycles however crypto has never lived through a full boom and bust cycle. It was born from the bust cycle yes but since 2008 bust and since 2009 BTC we can see that crypto hasn't ever gone through a full bust cycle. Macro economics suggest possible recession ahead. Look at any major index 5yr chart and it's been a great run. For the over all macro economic conditions, and due to this being a potential first for btc entering a recession, then yeah I believe 20k BTC can easily be a reality. I think it could go lower too but probably just wicks that get bought up. In better macro conditions BTC retraced over 80 percent...so imagine what it may do when all markets go down? Js I feel it's a lot of reasons to think it's not wierd and that the macro lows whatever they may be aren't in yet. Good luck to you too!\n\nEdited for better clarity",

IF we get a few years of zero action it\u2019s just more time to grow those stacks and make meaningful connections within the community, as well as sorting out it those who are building from those who were nothing but hype.",
