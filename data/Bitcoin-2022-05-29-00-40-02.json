Capital investors carry risk and debt for years developing solutions that single people could not do alone. And the market system of capitalism and free trade allows for a complex ecosystem of specialists that can focus an innovate in their areas. \n\nIt\u2019s that ecosystem that increases productivity. There are no vertical companies. A Dutch company creates a machine for creating CPUs with UV lithography, that is purchased by a Taiwanese semiconductor company, for devices designed by Americans and manufactured in China, and shipped/marketed/sold all over the world. \n\nAll of which needing heavy investment and researched for years before hitting the market. On a macro scale the individual contributors obviously do the work, but their work is multiplied many times by the efforts of others; particularly the technology and machines of others.\n\n*Thats* the measure of productivity measured at an economical scale that is only made possible by trusted currencies in open markets with capital investments at massive scales.",
