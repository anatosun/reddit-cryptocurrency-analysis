You can also get the private key for this wallet from the SoDogeTip website. You can transfer dogecoins into this wallet address and begin giving dogecoin to other people on reddit! And using your key you can also send coins yourself, even if the tipbot is down\nMaybe you see a meme that made you laugh? Give them a few dogecoin.\nMaybe you see an insightful post that helped you understand something better? Give them a few dogecoin.\nMaybe you see a charity you'd like to donate to. Do it with sodogetip. \n\nYou can also get the latest version of the dogecoin wallet (version  1.14.5) from www.dogecoin.com \n\n---\n\nHere are some links and topics that people have wanted me to post here.
