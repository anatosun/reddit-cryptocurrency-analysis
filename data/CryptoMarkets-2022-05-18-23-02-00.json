            "selftext": "Bitcoin (BTC) last traded above $50,000 on December 27, 2021. Four months have passed since then, but traders appear to be hopeful that inflation has reached the right level to spur bitcoin adoption.  \n\n\nIn principle, 8.5 percent inflation in the United States means that prices increase by 50% every five years. This effectively reduces the purchase power of the dollar by 33%, turning $100 into $66. Is this the fall of USD?  \n\n\nOn May 4, the Federal Reserve\u00a0(FOMC) of the United States is likely to make a decision on interest rates, but more crucially, the FED is expected to unveil a scheme to unload some of its $9 trillion balance sheet. As a result, rather than supporting the debt and mortgage markets, the Federal Reserve will most certainly sell $95 billion worth of these assets each month. Do you think this could affect the crypto market as well?   \n\n\nRisk markets have factored in the possibility of catastrophic outcomes. In 2022, the Russell 2000 mid-capitalization stock market index, for example, is down 16.5 percent year to date. Similarly, the Chinese stock market has had a 20% year-to-date correction, as assessed by the MSCI China index. Is this the time for investing? I've recently heard of some communities including High Sloth Society, ROSE, etc. What do you think about that? This may actually be something called a discounted market.  \n\n\nIt's impossible to predict what would set off a Bitcoin bull run, but Glassnode reported on April 18 that \"a considerable quantity of coin supply\" had accumulated between $38,000 and $45,000. There is a low-risk options method that can be utilized to place a long bullish bet for traders who anticipate BTC will hit $50,000 by July. What could this mean for BTC, thus for the crypto market as a whole?",

I would rather stake more now as i always do when dips happen. I have shifted focus to upcoming DeFi projects like KOLnet that monetizes influencers for their service. Its better to earn without investing monetarily right now, as BTC is not jumping. The good news is , its not tanking either.",

Real demand is not moon dreams, and lambos.  \n\nI got out last year, and plan to get in sub 20K. Ideally I want to see some major crypto bankruptcies (Terra/Luna is a start), and real collapse usage especially in major projects, especially the worst ones like solana, cardano, which are just glorified websites. Heck Etheruem failing would be great too.\n\nThe whole nft thing is pure trash, with every celeb launching an nft, that needs to be flushed down the toilet. \n\nThe world is driven by the US Dollars, no one measure crypto in the price of Euros or RMB. Until the Federal Reserve stops removing liquidity all assets especially the riskiest ones will go down.\n\nSo there is no rush to buy, and this will not be a V shaped recovery, the recovery in crypto will take 5-8 years at least befre we return to over 50K, like the .com.",
