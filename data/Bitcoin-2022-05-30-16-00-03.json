The point of the nonce is to add something to the hash input that results in a hash output smaller than a prescribed value. Due to the nature of the hashing algorithm, the only way to find such a value is to guess an input value over and over again until you find one that produces a satisfactory output. The smaller the prescribed target, the more difficult this needle-in-a-haystack challenge is. That's what keeps the blockchain safe: it's computationally expensive, so a malicious participant would need tremendous computing power to beat all of the honest participants in this race.",

The winning miner has a block which has a header which has a hash which is smaller than the current target. Counting leading zero bits only allows for power of 2 adjustments, which is too coarse. The numeric principle is the same, but the difference is significant  \n\n*    the nonce is only one part of the block header. The block header is hashed repeatedly, making a change each time. The nonce isn't big enough to be the only piece which changes during mining. Your question isn't really a nonce question  \n\nMathematically the miner's winning condition is to discover a hash within a range. The hash represents the block. The 80-byte block header is the hash input  \n\n> gigantic number of possibilities\n\nThat's the point. The winning hash has to fall within a range of values, and the size of the range has to be large enough for the miners to find it in an average time of 10 minutes. Finding a single 256-bit hash would require 2^255 guesses which would take billions of years  \n\nTo turn hashing from a single impossible guess result into a guessing competition, define the winning condition as a large range of values  \n\nThe bottom value of the range is zero. This means that the target number defines the size of the range. Then, the average number of guesses required is the size of the SHA256 number range ( 2^256 ) divided by the size of the target range  \n\nThe target is automatically adjusted every 2016 blocks  \n\nIf the blocks are created faster than 10 minutes, the target is made smaller, to make mining more difficult, restore the 10 minute average block time. And vice versa, if the blocks are slower than 10 minutes, the target is made larger  \n\nThe adjustment is a simple time ratio\n\n    New Target = Old Target * (Actual Time of Last 2016 Blocks / 20160 minutes)\n\nThe proof of work is  \n\n*    the hash is instantly provable by hashing the block header  \n*    the hash being smaller than target proves that the miners did the work",
