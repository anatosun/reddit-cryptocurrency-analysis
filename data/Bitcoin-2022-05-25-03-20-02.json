I don't think our society is built on trust, it's built on accountability.\n\nSecond, I didn't know bitcoin was exclusively for anarchists? I consider myself (in a vacuum) a libertarian socialist who disagrees with a powerful state but also disagrees with a lot of the modern, American paradigms of private ownership / capital.\n\nAnd to your main point, my whole argument is I don't think it should be considered ***their*** money to begin with. A corporation is an entity that impacts and is impacted by a wide range of stakeholders -- the owners of that corporation are only one of those stakeholders, alongside the employees, the customers, the suppliers, the immediate community and all levels of the state.\n\nWhen a corporation like Amazon operates, we have a system that lets the owners keep the vast majority of the economic benefit the corporation yields despite all the points I made above about how much of the business relies on publicly funded infrastructure to generate that profit and despite the fact that we are really bad at making corporations pay for their negative externalities. Amazon is not even adequately compensating us for all of the carbon and smog pollution those deliveries put into our atmosphere. But even something as simple as a loud delivery truck woke up Mr. Johnson who has to work a night shift and now he's 10% less productive on the job is never even thought about but it is a real negative impact.\n\nThe idea that a corporation and every bit of profit it generates *belongs* solely to the people who put up capital is a modern social construct, not some natural truth. If you really stop and think about the reality of all the various stakeholders involved in a corporation, you could start to see an alternate point of view that while a capitalist deserves to be (a) well-compensated for the labor involved in their role and (b) get their investment back with a healthy return, the employees, suppliers and taxpayers also deserve to enjoy a fair, proportionate piece of the pie given they play a big role in generating that economic value.\n\nThe hope of laissez-faire capitalism is that this happens naturally by the invisible hand of the market. But where we're at today, the distribution is obviously unfair. Low level employees make a tiny fraction of what the C-suite is paid and have zero bargaining power, big corporations use their economic power to bully their suppliers to lower costs thereby reducing their margins to be as thin as possible, taxes on the wealthy are at historically low levels, and the enforcement of fines and other mechanisms for capturing negative externalities is inadequate and sometimes non-existent.\n\nUnderstanding this already extreme and still growing imbalance the most pragmatic and achievable solution within our current system is increase taxes on the wealthy capitalist and redistribute it as universal basic income to everyone else. Which, by the way, taking it back to this sub and the idea of accountability, a blockchain could help facilitate in ways that reduces fraud and opens a transparent ledger of what I would call a \"social dividend\" as obvious stakeholders in these big corporations.",

I'm certain they're an arm of a statecraft outfit, I just can't figure out if that's the US or China. If they're not, then I should imagine this will be one of the last years they're operational in the West. US gov't can freeze their treasuries, designate their Tether a security, compel nations to aid in arresting their brass, or have every exchange delist them.\n\nI can't for the life of me understand the Tether apologists, especially amongst us maxi's. Stablecoins are counterfeit versions of inflationary fiat. They must be a scam because fiat itself is a scam. They act as drag on bitcoin's escape velocity by providing extraordinary leverage (levels that would be illegal in traditional equities), and they dollarize nations where bitcoin would otherwise be taking hold, especially when their native fiat is more volatile than BTC",
