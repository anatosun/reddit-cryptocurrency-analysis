I'm certain they're an arm of a statecraft outfit, I just can't figure out if that's the US or China. If they're not, then I should imagine this will be one of the last years they're operational in the West. US gov't can freeze their treasuries, designate their Tether a security, compel nations to aid in arresting their brass, or have every exchange delist them. \n\nI can't fo the life of me understand the Tether apologists. Stablecoins are counterfeit versions of inflationary fiat. They must be a scam because fiat itself is a scam. They act as drag on bitcoin's escape velocity by providing extraordinary leverage (levels that would be illegal in traditional equities), and they dollarize nations where bitcoin would otherwise be taking hold, especially when their native fiat is more volatile than BTC",
