            "selftext": "Hi guys, I had binance card since Jan 2021, I created it pretty much while I was comparing those crypto cards (CDC, Wirex, Binance and few others). I eventually decided not to go with Binance, but CDC instead. So, I only used BNB Card with Curve, Physical card never leave my shuffle.\n\nHowever, today I got declined transaction (insuficientes funds) from \"Cosmote AVT Telco AN W MAROUSI GR \" (clearly scam) they tried to charge 30 EUR, which I don't really care, because there were just some dust. However, I have never paid with card on POS or Online (only via Curve) and this websites ([https://scamcharge.com/c/cosmote-shop-amarousiou-marousi-gr](https://scamcharge.com/c/cosmote-shop-amarousiou-marousi-gr)) tells I am not a single one who has this issue with BNB card.\n\nBecause my other cards in Curve are just fine and safe I suppose, there is a leak on Binance side. I just wanted to let you know, I blocked card, won't be issuing new one.",
