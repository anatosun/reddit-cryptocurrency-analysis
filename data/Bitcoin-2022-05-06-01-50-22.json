Every time the interest rates are raised cryptocurrencies face the risk of selling off, a large amount of money flows from the crypto circle to sound investments and the rate hike means that excess liquidity is being extracted from the financial markets. The support for crypto asset markets is weakened, creating more uncertainty.  \nIf the Fed continues to follow its plan and execute seven consecutive sub-rate hikes, the impact on cryptocurrencies will be huge. Although bitcoin did not open a downward channel in the face of this Fed rate hike announcement, crypto assets have opened a downward mode as early as the end of last year when the Fed announced that it would begin to scale back its bond purchases and hinted at rising interest rates. With the Fed raising rates, bitcoin will likely continue to trade in a price range this year without a significant increase.\n\nSo is the current market panic a better buying opportunity?",

It\u2019s an organisation where customers may complete many low cost transactions per day.\n\nMy theory is that we could create an app that opens a lightning channel between us and the customer, customers could then link their bank/card to the app, and then every time they pay us they use the lightning network and the VISA fee is avoided.\n\nHowever, I can\u2019t help but think that regardless, a fee would be incurred when the customer deposits funds into the app in order to be able to pay for their goods via the lightning network. \n\nHow does the customer get funds into a position to use the lightning network with us without incurring a fee (without sending BTC to the app)?\n\nWould massively appreciate if someone could clarify!\n\nThanks!",

When handled properly those issues don\u2019t exist. \n\nLater the letter talks about volatility of Bitcoin and mentions 1,000 people owning 15% of all Bitcoin. Less people own more percentage of most major companies. And the point the letter misses is that people want a level of \u201cvolatility\u201d because when greater adoption kicks in it will result in massive gains. \n\nThe letter also questions why Fidelity are allowing 401k investments in Bitcoin when people aren\u2019t asking for it. What is that statement based on? Fidelity wouldn\u2019t offer it if there wasn\u2019t a market and I GUARANTEE they will have people taking them up. \n\nAll in all, this is a senator putting their nose where it has nothing to do with them and they have limited grasp of the field",

The meat of it is a request for information from Fidelity.\n\n>In order to better understand how Fidelity arrived at the decision to expose retirement accounts to the risks inherent in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, we request answers to the following questions by May 18, 2022:\n\n1. Why did Fidelity ignore DOL\u2019s \u201cserious concerns regarding the prudence of a fiduciary\u2019s decision to expose a 401(k) plan's participants to direct investments in cryptocurrencies\u201d22?\n2. What risks does Fidelity assess that Bitcoin presents to its customers?\n\n>a. What are the specific volatility and loss risks posed by Bitcoin, and how will Fidelity address these risks?  \n>  \n>b. What are the specific fraud risks posed by Bitcoin, and how will Fidelity address these risks? What are the specific theft risks posed by Bitcoin, and how will Fidelity address these risks?  \n>  \n>c. How will Fidelity address the additional Bitcoin risks identified by DOL,including the challenge for plan participants to make informed investment decisions, custodial and record keeping concerns, valuation concerns, and the evolving regulatory environment?  \n>  \n>3. What fees will your customers incur if they decide to invest in Bitcoin?  \n>  \n>4. How much has Fidelity earned from cryptomining activities since the establishment of its mining operation?  \n>  \n>5. When Fidelity made its decision to allow sales of Bitcoin in retirement accounts, how did the company address its own conflicts of interest, given that the company now is both a Bitcoin miner and a purveyor of Bitcoin?\n\nMy question to the Bitcoin community is this: Why do we continue to allow these misleading titles to make us look like knee-jerk reactionary fools instead of critical thinkers? Why are we OK with people purposefully misconstruing or editorializing the contents of an article or letter to support their own political bias at our expense? This clearly isn't a case of *what* was said, but of *who* is saying something at all.\n\nShe wants to know the risks involved in adding Bitcoin to retirement accounts given its historic volitity and what Fidelity is doing to mitigate those risks. And it is risky. What's the most common advice people give on this subreddit? *Don't invest more than you can afford to lose*. How many people can afford to lose a significant part of their retirement? Look what happened to people forced to retire following '08 whose 401ks were devalued by 20%-50%. It crippled their twilight years. Some of them are still working. *Every* politician should be asking these questions on behalf of their constituents if we want Bitcoin to be a legitimate venue for mainstream retirement accounts.",

You don\u2019t have to sell your BTC in order to take a RMD, and instead can do an in-kind transfer to a brokerage account, but you will still be taxed at your income brackets. So even though you benefit from the employer match in a 401k, you will be taxed out the ass in retirement. If you prefer to have more control of your BTC it may be better to do cold storage or in a hot wallet, but obviously have multi-layered security practices. For the more savvy, you could lend out your BTC, and use the loan as income, or other investments, as well as for servicing that debt. Lending out your BTC avoids taxes and you can actually get a tax break on the interest. DYOR.",

You try to recover your account and they never give it back to you. This actually happened to me with Binance. They asked me dozens of questions and I still wasn't able to recover my account.\n\n\\- You send money to the exchange through a bank wire transfer or similar and the money \"is lost\". You contact them and they insist it's a bank issue on your end. You contact your bank and they insist it's an exchange issue.\n\n\\- You withdraw your money to your bank and the transaction is stuck in limbo. The bank needs to \"review it\". You then have to wait several days hoping that they are merciful enough to give you your money.\n\nAnd many, many other ways.\n\nIf you have money on an exchange, you don't have any money.\n\nRead this if you don't know how Bitcoin works: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/uhwfms/banks\\_assign\\_you\\_account\\_numbers\\_with\\_bitcoin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/uhwfms/banks_assign_you_account_numbers_with_bitcoin/)\n\nGet your money off exchanges.\n\nNow.",

            "selftext": "I thought I would share my observations on the market right now.  I mostly trade in crypto although I do hold some stocks.\n\nThe Market is a dumpster fire.  The dollar is decoupling from oil and the federal reserve lacks the political will power to raise interest rates to curtail stagnation.   The rally yesterday after the news of the limited rate hike, was indicative of how corrupt and broken the system is.  There is circular flow of capital, that is big players buying the dips and selling the rallys.  This is an acquisition of market assets by a few institutions (vanguard, blackrock).  The casino is rig fokes and it is akin to Plato's Cave allegory.  One in which people are chained to a chair and forced to stare at shadows cast on the wall in front of them.  The individuals who rise to promentance are the best bullshiters, who are able to forecast what shadows might appear next.\n\nThat is the stock market in a nutshell, shadows and rigged statistics and false earnings reports to cover up the monstrous debt that everyone is in.  In reality it is worse, because instead of shadows randomly cast by torch bearers in the background, certain players are privy to macro economic realities prior to market opens.   Making it inevitable that bad actors game the system.  Creating false rallies that retail investors FOMO in on and then are left holding the bag after the inevitable pull back.\n\nBitcoin.  The whole crypto space is down as Bitcoin is down.  The crypto market is really a speculative ecosystem that exists in Bitcoin\u2019s shadow.  Bitcoin price action directly correlates with the major stock indexes.  If stocks dip, Bitcoin follows suit.   The reasoning for this is simple; stock investors dabble in the crypto space.  A lot of the activity in the crypto space is driven by the same players.  The same strategies of pump and dump, buying the dips, selling the rallies apply.  Furthermore, Bitcoin and the crypto market are dumping because investors are selling off to make margin.  Simply, the crypto space is being sold off to cover the losses in the stock market.  Bitcoin could easily go down to 25k, or even 10k.   Considering how much capital institutions and governments have started to put into Bitcoin.  If the economy continues to slide and the market continues to tumble, institutions will sell off their more risky assets to cover their liquidation and margin calls.\n\nBut once this is done and the market bottom is in.  Bitcoin will not only recover, it will do so quickly.  It will decouple from the nasdaq and tech indexes.  And hopefully take its place as a global reserve currency/asset/property.  Free of censorship, inflation and centralization.  Silver and gold are also on a collision course.   Silver needs to come up, constitutional (junk) silver is trading at a 40 percent premium.   It's crazy.   The paper gold and silver from comex is over leveraged and over sold.  There's not enough physical silver to cover the demand, let alone the obligations of the futures contracts.   That being said, silver investors have been saying the same thing for the last 15 years.\n\nIn short, the sky is falling, the commercial re-estate bubble is collapsing, the dollar is losing its value, and the banks lack the political will power to raise interest rates.  The president of the United States seems to be compromised by international business interests.  Whom, are taking this opportunity to consolidate their control over the global economy.   My advice: put a tin foil hat on and buy; Ammo, Silver, Gold, Land and bitcoin.",

            "selftext": "I was reading about CTV and think I may have stumbled on a congestion issue that I don't see many people talking about.\n\nAt a high level, CTV basically allows the output script of a transaction to specify which output scripts must come next. One potential application mentioned on Jeremy Rubin's webpage is [congestion controlled transactions](https://utxos.org/uses/scaling/). These transactions essentially consist of a small (low-fee) initial transaction, whose next output would be a large (high-fee) transaction with lots of outputs. These can even be chained together to form a tree with orders-of-magnitude more outputs. As described on the page:\n\n> When there is a high demand for blockspace it becomes very expensive to make transactions. By using OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, a large volume payment processor may aggregate all their payments into a single O(1) transaction for purposes of confirmation. Then, some time later, the payments can be expanded out of that UTXO when the demand for blockspace is decreased.\n\nDespite the name, I think these types of transactions could lead to more congestion, not less. Suppose all the major exchanges implemented withdrawals using CTV-locked \"congestion controlled transactions\". If each root transaction expanded into a tree with 100 leaf addresses, then a single block full of these root txs would require at minimum 100 blocks to complete final settlement of everyone's withdrawals.\n\nMore generally, if each block contained a fraction of congestion controlled transactions *f*, and each transaction expanded into an average number of leaf transactions *L*, then if f\\*L > 1, the time needed to complete every leaf settlement would grow with each block. It would be like turning the blockchain into an exponentially-growing mempool that could never clear out.\n\nAnother application mentioned on Jeremy's webpage is [batch channels](https://utxos.org/uses/batch-channels/) (or \"channel factories\"), which are similar to congestion controlled transactions except the leafs would be lightning channels instead of regular bitcoin addresses. In theory, as soon as the root transaction is broadcasted, users could consider the channel \"open\" since their funding transaction is \"guaranteed\" by a chain of CTV-locked transactions. However in practice, if an exponentially large number of channels were opened this way, it would be infeasible for even a small percentage to ever close on-chain. For example it would be possible to \"open\" a billion channels with a tiny number of initial transactions, but since the blockchain only allows ~100M transactions per year, it would take ten years to close them all, or one year to close even 10% of them.\n\nThis post isn't intended to be an anti-CSV stance per se, rather I just wanted to bring awareness to a potential negative effect at the system level that I'm not sure if people realized yet. The only place I've seen it discussed was on a twitter thread [here](https://twitter.com/AgoristView/status/1522082921259147264). Of course, CTV is opt-in and users could choose to avoid these types of transactions in the first place, but if users were not aware of the risks then they might be stuck with bags of CTV-locked txs that would never settle.\n\ntl;dr: If you think of the bitcoin blockchain like a highway where creating UTXOs are the on-ramps and spending UTXOs are the off-ramps, CTV increases the number of on-ramps exponentially without adding any new off-ramps, potentially leading to congestion.",

I don't think CTV itself contains any ad-hoc limits, it's a relatively simple opcode.\n\n> I imagine there must be limits in place, otherwise it would be trivially easy to DOS the network with a sufficiently large batch.\n\nI wouldn't say that it's DOSing the network since the root transactions would all be relatively small and would still pay the necessary miner fees to get included into blocks. To me, the danger lies more in people thinking their funds are safe in a CTV-locked tree, but then once the trees try to expand they become so big that nobody can spend their coins.",

However, unit value (what it's actually worth) goes through the roof.  .. like getting a package of kool-aid for $1 instead of a cup of kool-aid for $1. The package is a much better value than getting a cup. Obviously it's the best time to buy. \n\nCrypto is like this too. Right now we get a tremendous value for very little fiat. Next fall when it does a 5x or 10x in price, the value proposition is significantly limited. It all comes back to units. What are your units of btc worth in 2030? Is it better to bag them at $40k when everyone says to flee, or to get them at $100k when everyone says buy? HODLers and DCA folks know the answer. But it's difficult to wrap our minds around the idea that a package that makes a lot of products is far better than 1 serving of the end product. \n\n2 Satoshis et al \n\ud83d\udc3a \ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf19",

            "selftext": "Today, President Biden will sign two Presidential directives that will advance national initiatives in quantum information science (QIS), signaling the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s commitment to this critical and emerging technology. Together, the two directives lay the groundwork for continued American leadership in an enormously promising field of science and technology, while mitigating the risks that quantum computers pose to America\u2019s national and economic security.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe United States has long been a global leader in the development of new technologies, like QIS. QIS is a broad field of science and engineering. Quantum computers, one of the many promising applications of QIS, are not a replacement to traditional computers. Rather, they are a fundamentally different kind of computer, with the ability to analyze information in ways that traditional computers cannot. While QIS itself is not new, recent breakthroughs in QIS have shown the potential to drive innovations across the American economy, from energy to medicine, through advancements in computation, networking and sensing. Breakthroughs in QIS are poised to generate entirely new industries, good-paying jobs, and economic opportunities for all Americans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPresident Biden will sign an Executive Order to foster these advances by furthering the President\u2019s commitment to promoting breakthroughs in cutting-edge science and technology. It does so by enhancing the National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee, the Federal Government\u2019s principal independent expert advisory body for quantum information science and technology. The EO places the advisory committee directly under the authority of the White House, ensuring that the President, Congress, Federal departments and agencies, and the general public receive the most current, accurate, and relevant information on quantum information science and technology to drive forward U.S. policymaking and advance our technological edge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe President will also sign a National Security Memorandum outlining the Administration\u2019s plan to address the risks posed by quantum computers to America\u2019s cybersecurity. Research shows that at some point in the not-too-distant future, when quantum computers reach a sufficient size and level of sophistication, they will be capable of breaking much of the cryptography that currently secures our digital communications on the Internet. To address this risk, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will publish new quantum-resistant cryptographic standards that can protect against these future attacks. However, the process to transition America\u2019s most vulnerable IT systems to these new standards will take time, resources, and commitment. America must start the lengthy process of updating our IT infrastructure today to protect against this quantum computing threat tomorrow. NSM-X lays out a plan to get us there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpecifically, the National Security Memorandum:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions the United States to remain a global leader in technology development, and Quantum Information Science in particular. The NSM directs Federal agencies to pursue a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to harness the economic and scientific benefits of QIS for all Americans, as well as the security enhancements of new cryptographic systems. It sets forth a policy to promote quantum-relevant education programs and workforce development initiatives, emphasizes a coordinated approach to foundational scientific research, and encourages the strengthening of partnerships with industry, academic institutions, and allies and partners overseas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInitiates collaboration between the Federal Government and the private sector. It directs NIST to establish a \u201cMigration to Post-Quantum Cryptography Project\u201d at the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence, as well as an open working group with industry to generate research on, and encourage widespread, equitable adoption of, quantum-resilient cryptographic standards and technologies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSets requirements for Federal agencies to update cryptographic systems. Given the complexity, costs, and time required to fully transition to quantum-resistant cryptographic standards, the NSM provides a roadmap for agencies to inventory their IT systems, with a requirement to set and meet specific milestones. Doing so will help ensure that Federal agencies get the support they need to fully and effectively protect their networks from future exploitation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProtects United States technology. The NSM recognizes the importance of protecting critical technology from theft and abuse. To this end, the NSM directs Federal agencies to develop comprehensive plans to safeguard American intellectual property, research and development, and other sensitive technology from acquisition by America\u2019s adversaries, and to educate industry and academia on the threats they face. It encourages engagement with international partners to ensure a competitive and fair global marketplace that fosters innovation and continued growth in the field.",

The rising interest rate will fight inflation and remove excess liquidity in the financial system that goes to things like risk assets including bitcoin.  It will also make it very difficult for the Federal Government to borrow money.  Deficit spending will continue as usual as there have not been any announcements to reduce it.  Within two years (probably sooner) the Federal Government will have so much difficulty borrowing money that the Federal Reserve will need to print more money.  That will bring back the price of bitcoin far above what it is now.\n\nToo long, didn't read: make sure you have emergency cash, keep working your fiat job, and be ready to buy (not sell you dolt!) some low priced bitcoin.\n\nIn other news, I feel kind of bad watching the Federal Reserve and Federal Government mess things up and almost rooting for them to do it more.",
