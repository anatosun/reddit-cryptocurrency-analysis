What you seem to fail to grasp and that everyone here is trying to tell you, is that as long as you hold them on these exchanges, sites or any other place, there are significant risks.\n\n1- In the event where that exchange is struggling financially, their reserves of BTC may not hold enough to pay everyone who holds BTC on their platform. Imagine you are locked in for 90 days for a solid 5% apy, rumors start that platform X is struggling, you are locked in while everyone withdraws and no more BTC for you.\n\n2- Other scenario, they go bankrupt, you are not financially protected in any way shape or form. They will pay their creditors with your BTC and you'll get the scraps.\n\nTons more examples, but that's why everyone is rightfully telling you, BTC is built in a way where you should not need to be paid APY on it to be worth holding unlike Fiat.
