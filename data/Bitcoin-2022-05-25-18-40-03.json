I'll give you a chicken in exchange for some bananas.

There is no fucken reason to ever borrow BTC except to short it.  Read up on how BTC is shorted.  You will see that while they pay you a measley 0.02% daily , your coins are pooled and shorted by big money players.  \nThe short sellers pay a little extra than your being paid.  This is how those platforms make money.  They don't give a fuck about BTC only care about the fees they collect.   Pay you 8% APY , by charging 20% APY to those that borrow. \n\n\nI wish people's response wasn't \"not your keys\" blah blah , cause the fact of the matter is these platforms are crushing the price of BTC.

Some exchanges offer you APY in exchange to holding your BTC on their platform. Which is the equivalent of giving up your coins albeit temporarily and the idea is that you'll get them back whenever you decide to withdraw. What you seem to fail to grasp and that everyone here is trying to tell you, is that as long as you hold them on these exchanges, sites or any other place, there are significant risks.\n\n1- In the event where that exchange is struggling financially, their reserves of BTC may not hold enough to pay everyone who holds BTC on their platform. Imagine you are locked in for 90 days for a solid 5% apy, rumors start that platform X is struggling, you are locked in while everyone withdraws and no more BTC for you.\n\n2- Other scenario, they go bankrupt, you are not financially protected in any way shape or form. They will pay their creditors with your BTC and you'll get the scraps.\n\nTons more examples, but that's why everyone is rightfully telling you, BTC is built in a way where you should not need to be paid APY on it to be worth holding unlike Fiat. Hold it on a hardware wallet and forget about it.",
