            "selftext": "**TL;DR: How can blockchain nodes communicate to tell each other to update the ledger without the use of a centralized server?**\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m a bit of a bitcoin noob, so correct me if anything I say here doesn\u2019t make sense or is just completely wrong.\n\nI\u2019m interested primarily in blockchains and decentralization in general. As part of my research on blockchains, the concept of keeping decentralized ledgers eluded me.\n\nMainly, I\u2019m wondering how each node in the blockchain receives a new copy of the ledger to validate. Wouldn\u2019t they need\n\nA) a central ledger to grab and validate locally\n\nOr\n\nB) some sort of communication protocol (which would mean a server storing connected nodes).\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing something really simple, like I said, I\u2019m an absolute beginner in all of this. Any expert out there that can help?",

If you want, you can override this by manually providing addresses to other nodes.\n\nFrom that point on, the client will exchange lists of peers it knows are online with all the peers it is connected to. Each time the client is restarted, it will use its list of known peers, ordered by when they were last seen online and with some randomization to prevent always getting the same ones, to set up connections. At this stage, it will no longer use the hardcoded peers as those are only for the very first startup or as a last resort fallback.\n\nA fresh client will request the full blockchain from the peers it is connected to and it will validate everything it receives to ensure it's all correct.\n\nSo there's a little bit of centralization in the bootstrapping process where the client first discovers peers to connect with. This is hard to avoid, because a completely new client needs to have some starting point. But, if you want, you can always override the predetermined starting point by providing your own set of peer addresses.",

From a technical standpoint, a 3rd party must initialize the P2P discovery process, or else the P2P clients must have a hard coded path to an always-online client which can point them to other clients. In the case of Bitcoin, it seems it is the latter :)",
