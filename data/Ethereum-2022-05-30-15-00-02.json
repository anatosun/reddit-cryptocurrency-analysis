This one's a bit difficult to explain, but basically, it defines several blocks and transactions covered by a single proof as a \"chunk\", and then you can write a program that computes these in some sort of way that leads to efficiency gains for certain usecases. Copy/pasting from the proposal: \n\n>Examples of useful CPP:\n\n>1. Econometrics\n>2. Non-linear statistics, like median tx size, median fee, etc. (linear statistics, like average, can be computed without CPP, chunk by chunk), this could be used for the following\n>3. Fee Mechanism design - long-range statistics could feed into fee mechanism to enforce better estimation\n>4.  Data availability\n>5. Daily state-diff, perhaps even using lossless compression\n>6. Daily volition/validium state diff, for users who are happy with daily use of Validium but at the end of each day wish to have data committed onchain\n\n// cont. \n\n- Sign-in with StarkWare is now live!\n\n- StarkGate bridge now supports DAI! You heard that right!\n\n- Over 250 ETH have been bridged so far (there's a cap).\n\n- StarkNet Community Call #14 including notes. Topic: myBraavos wallet presentation & account abstraction examples.\n\n- lots of dev resources this week! If you're interested in Cairo, definitely go check them out!\n\n- and lots more as usual!\n\nMake sure to check out the full post linked above.
