An insult, is only relative to the people involved, in the context of the insult.\n\nSo, for me, a person who dumped crypto way before the last big sell off, and bought into stocks while everything was down....\n\nAnd you, still invested, and prolly down 5 or 6 figures, like most other crypto investors. Still promoting it, thinking its still some pie in the sky...\n\nThen it would seem that I am the winner, while you are the loser.\n\n![gif](giphy|3o7qDSOvfaCO9b3MlO|downsized)",
