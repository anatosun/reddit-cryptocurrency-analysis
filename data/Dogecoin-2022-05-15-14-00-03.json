Only if Tesla accepts GrimaceCoin.\n\nHave you thought about this before, why McDonald's? Why is it so important that it accepts DogeCoin as a payment method? Did Elon Musk make a random choice? I do not think so.\n\nTake a look at what has happened recently. Elon Musk has repeatedly expressed his concerns about freedom of speech. Then he made his move, first stepping onto the Twitter board, and now making his move to buy it all.\n\nWhy did people get so much sympathy for a businessman to buy a company? The same did not happen with Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp or Google's acquisition of YouTube. All of these were acquisitions for commercial interest.\n\nElon Musk has clearly put forward an idea. Freedom of speech should not be hindered. His $41 billion bid to Twitter became his manifesto.\n\nNothing is accidental. This is a successful communication campaign by a businessman. Every detail has been planned. Right now, the entire Twitter board is at the target of the arrows.\n\nNow let's get back to why McDonald's is so important.\n\nThe Big Mac Index\n\nThe Big Mac Index is a price index published by The Economist as an informal way of measuring the purchasing power parity (PPP) between two currencies and provides a test of the extent to which market exchange rates result in goods costing the same in different countries. It \"seeks to make exchange-rate theory a bit more digestible.\"\n\nThe index, created in 1986, takes its name from the Big Mac, a hamburger sold at McDonald's restaurants.\n\nWhy is the Big Mac price an economic indicator?\n\nThe factors that make up the Big Mac price are basically food costs, logistics costs, rental cost, labor cost. Taking the average of these costs gives fairly consistent data about the country's economy and the purchasing power of money.\n\nMcDonald's holds the biggest measure of economic injustice. The target point of the Big Mac Index is central financing. This is stand for all the values \u200b\u200bthat the crypto world has rebelled against.\n\nIndex the BigMac price to the DogeCoin price and make DogeCoin the measure of the financial world. In the current economic model, the product price is formed by the induction method. What would be the result of taking the resulting price and connecting it to a decentralized currency?\n\nThis is to pull the pin of the bomb and leave it in the lap of the financial world. Bold move!",
