But the artificial demand for USD reserve assets doesn't mean that if USD is no longer the global reserve currency, then the US would be bankrupt (i.e. default on its obligations). Instead the US will go through a painful period of inflation where existing debt is monetized (i.e. paid in full with 'newly printed' dollars, which causes inflation) until the debt load is manageable. That doesn't mean a collapse, but probably something more like post-WWII UK.\n\nNote that the Triffin dilemma is currency-agnostic; it's a general problem with having a national currency serve as the global reserve currency. China could go ahead and try, but they would be faced with the same problem. And they're classic mercantilists who love their trade surpluses...",
