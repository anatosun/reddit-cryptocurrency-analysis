Elon musk has a really bad reputation and it's only getting worse. He's radioactive.\n\nSo sorry if I misread your post. You're right we are the ones who carry doge. But doge = Elon's Ego has an effect in doge as well since there are people who would beleive if Elon fell and tesla failed doge would crash too. It's a self fulfilling prophecy that we can recover from but it would be a rough ride just like I warned about a month ago about how I wasn't going to have any part in the next actions and someone else will be playing my role since I wanted to keep my hands clean... It was obvious anonymous with the Twitter thing there would be an attack an anything Elon and Doge was in the cross hairs...\n\nBtc isn't really the king of anything either. Attacking doge also causes all else to fall including the market. That's a secret I never let out but the cats kinda out of the bag.\n\nThats why I started using the darklyLlT handle instead. And we even started the reversal while I was using that handle since I still didn't really want to be involved in this whole thing. The crash was a lot worse than I even thought but I  never literally said I was going to step out and out right change names and state that I was transferring my role to a \"money ain't real type so buckle up for a bunoy ride\" before. I was hoping me doing something that drastic would be enough for people to know how serious j was. I only did that knowing full well it was gonna be bad.... \n\nI wanted to keep my hands clean but you still can't keep your conscience clean just standing by.",
