My savings are depreciating in value faster than my ability to make more by working. \n\nThe only guarantee in life with money is that other people want your money and they will get it. Learning to lock it away from yourself is the key. I feel Bitcoin helps me do this better and more often than other ways. So have fun with it. Don\u2019t make it too stressful or have too many conditions; instead consider after a year or two: did you build your financial wealth more or did your consumption change in a positive way?\n\nBut you asked for specifics: I would recommend 50% of your fiat savings converted into BTC soon while the price is staying low, and do not think about needing it before fall 2024. Sell before then at your own risk and only because you need gas money or desperate.\n\nBut get in the game, stay for a while, participate regularly, and learn all you can. Your knowledge will serve you well in this industry. There is more than the price. A lot to geek out on and profit from.",
