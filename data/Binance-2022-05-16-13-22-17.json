            "selftext": "Hi! I have discovered a lot of sites that offer crypto ratings for different projects, with analysis and a full report with their findings. [Xangle](https://xangle.io/en/) for example, is a South Korean business focused on a disclosure platform for crypto projects. The exchanges in that part of the world, need a third-party rating report to list their tokens because the Korean commercial banks require it. [Here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xangle-credibility-ratings-used-korean-121000301.html) is an article I found. My question is, ... do you find helpful their crypto reports?\n\nOther platforms/websites that offer analysis are TokenInsight and Baserank. If you have other platforms that do crypto projects analysis, let me know.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/uqvrsx)",
