It's one of the highest success rate trading methods I use, it just doesn't happen very frequently being that it is always against the probability. But this idea is shown on the chart with the blue area. On a retest of range higher is where I will be loading with longs, until then just short term trading.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/dBGpuAlK/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/dBGpuAlK/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zh71pxlzba291.png?width=1834&format=png&auto=webp&s=e46ac89109f4099525ca85dc86b1e09f50f0e1ac",
