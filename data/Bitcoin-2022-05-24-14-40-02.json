In history, we have never printed more than 6 back to back red weekly candles.\n\nDo you think this has any significance at all? I don't think it seems to have too much considering we already know it's a clear bear market, but I'm just curious what other people think. That happened in 2014 if you wanted to check btw, at a time when it actually had a relief rally shortly after the 6 but then continued to keep making lower lows.\n\nA lot of people think we are also due for a relief rally (relief because there's basically no chance it would hold in a bear market.) What do y'all think? Do you see the similarities here too or is this a whole new thing to try to fathom? Interested to hear your opinions!",

I've also set buy orders under the 25k range in addition to an altcoin im heavily invested in. I think we get good recovery by 2023 assuming we don't fall into that huge multi year recession.",
