Now one month after I get a Email that my verification has failed although i haven't done anything and my account is again on unverified. After checking with the support I get the info that they have updated the compliance standards and I have to do the verification again (nonsense cause non of my friends had the same problem but okay). Because I don't have any bills on my name I sent the first time a letter from the tax office with my name and address which was accepted as it is a official document from the tax office with stamp etc and was just 15 days old (Case ID 87394129). This time my verification gets rejected although i sent the same document and even the support is ignoring my case that this document was already verified (Case ID 89773509).. So is there any guidelines at binance or just luck which support representative you get, so that sometimes even if you do everything right you get blown off...???",
