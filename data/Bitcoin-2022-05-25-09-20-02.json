Last I looked it averaged 5, just, 5 per year. By any reasonable definition there is not any real unable to get food poverty here. There is \"poor\" no doubt about that. I would happily argue that 5% of the population is truly stuck (various reasons). The other 95% simply can't manage their money.  It makes no sense to spend more than you make. If you spend more than you make you can't invest in your future(school, stock, real estate, etc).",

If you look into his childhood he had 90-day multi-million dollar revolving door loans when he was 20 fresh out of college. His parents owned a huge real estate firm in the town that he grew up in that's how he was able to get 90-day revolving door loans. One of Dave Ramsey's toughest life stories is when the bank that was giving him the loans got bought out by someone else and they cut off his loans. So he had to sell a couple houses early oh my. \n\n\nThis dude is actually why I don't talk to my father anymore. I asked my dad to take a loan out on his investments for other Capital investing. And he sat there straight face and try to tell me that nobody does that. He tried to sit there and tell me that Dave Ramsey doesn't do this. In all actuality Dave Ramsey was getting larger loan amounts at 20 years old than most of us will ever be able to achieve. \n\n\nDo exactly opposite of what Dave Ramsey tells you to do. Dave Ramsey is a rich person he was born rich he's going to die rich his kids are even Rich he made his kid vice president of his own company. Lol.",

This is almost 8 years ago. Who do you know *at that time* thought a single BTC was going to be $69,000 someday, let alone by now? Fewer than 0.001% of the users here can say a non-zero number honestly.\n\nBuy the dip. We won't be sub 50k for long.",

Just HODLing contributes to that since you are helping to maintain Bitcoin's market value. Our reward for that is the multiplication our purchasing power.\n\nI'll give Ramsey the benefit of the doubt since I like how he stays consistent on his financial advice. Its simple, common sense for the masses. His advice will work even better in a hyperbitcoinized world. So I'll assume here that he doesn't secretly stack and that he practices what he preaches. \n\nPeople like Ramsey are extremely conservative when it comes to their finances and anything new really. They want to see a lot of institutional and societal adoption before they jump in. I think that's fine. They are choosing to trade the multiplication of their purchasing power for stability and history. Once Bitcoin becomes the saving method of choice or even the global reserve asset, they'll come around. Everyone gets in at the price they deserve. We just have to focus on making Bitcoin ready for that.",

The point is, he\u2019s a super conservative investor, who doesn\u2019t believe in any debt except for your mortgage. Why would you expect that guy to ever be for bitcoin? He will be the last adopter and he\u2019s ok with that. His pint is that this country is way too much in debt and his approach seeks to solve that. Just because we bought in 2014 doesn\u2019t mean that we are investment geniuses, it just means that it was right place right time. Also Dave might buy bitcoin on his own, we don\u2019t know. But I think his point is to his followers who are trying to get out of debt is that there are better less risky things to put your money.",
