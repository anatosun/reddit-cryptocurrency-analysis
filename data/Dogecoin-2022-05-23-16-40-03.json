Can I move my coins from the coinbase exchange to coinbase wallet and not have to worry about this? Or should I transfer to another wallet. What\u2019s the way to go?",

But any free wallet app that supports doge can create those wallets and the wallet itself is always the same thing, an address on the blockchain.\n\nThe only thing the application itself does is encrypt your key so it can't be stolen and send your transfer-requests to the blockchain. That's all. \n\nDon't think too complicated. It's about as easy to do as a free email account.",

Put both files on a USB stick.\n\nThen pick one wallet, add \u2018Coinbase\u2019 as a comment, and send your coins there.\n\nAnd you\u2019re all done. Make copies of the files on multiple removable media. Stash them in safe places so a fire or flood won\u2019t destroy them all. Congratulate yourself on having secure, FREE cold storage. Feel free to laugh at people who buy expensive hardware devices that aren\u2019t as good as what you now have.\n\nFeel free to play with coinb.in using any wallet at all. Maybe RH\u2019s cold wallets even. But don\u2019t use your own wallets live. Only sign transactions offline so you never expose your keys to the internet.",
