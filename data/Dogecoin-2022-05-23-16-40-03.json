Can I move my coins from the coinbase exchange to coinbase wallet and not have to worry about this? Or should I transfer to another wallet. What\u2019s the way to go?",

(5 doge iirc)\n\ncheapest is a simple text-wallet (see pinned posts in daily thread). But any free wallet app that supports doge can create those wallets and the wallet itself is always the same thing, an address on the blockchain.\n\nThe only thing the application itself does is encrypt your key so it can't be stolen and send your transfer-requests to the blockchain. That's all. \n\nDon't think too complicated. It's about as easy to do as a free email account.",
