Over the next few months, Cloudflare will launch, **and fully stake**, Ethereum validator nodes on the Cloudflare global network as the community approaches its transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake with \u201cThe Merge.\u201d These nodes will serve as a testing ground for research on energy efficiency, consistency management, and network speed.\n\nSo they're going to stake themselves? This is not an offer to their customers?\n\nEdit: Recent discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ura484/cloudflare_is_experimenting_with_running_pos_nodes/",
