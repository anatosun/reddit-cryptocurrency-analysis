I followed the instructions and made the payment yesterday afternoon. Coinbase sent me an email confirming \"funds recovery complete,\" but that my account may still have restrictions. \n\nToday, I no longer see the box in the app saying that my account has been limited. However, I still can't deposit, trade, withdraw etc. \n\nWhen can I expect these limits to lift off of my account?",
