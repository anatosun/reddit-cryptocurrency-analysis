            "selftext": "So this is very weird. I had a large amount of Ethereum stored on my ledger cold storage device. I sent them yesterday evening to my coinbase account. I double-checked the address and the funds. \n\nA day later, still nothing on my coinbase account. I thought initially the transaction takes time because they're doing a security audit or something similar, or that there was an issue, so I waited before contacting CB support. I called them this morning, explaining the situation, after an hour or so they escalated the issue to a manager of some sort. He was able to show me a page with all the ethereum wallets associated to my account. The said wallet to which I had sent the funds wasn't there. There was a different one created at the same time. \n\nIt gets weird, because, 1, I have double checked and triple checked the addres. 2, the transaction appears on etherscan as successful, and was sent from the original receivining address to Coinbase 5. So the money got to coinbase, but this wallet does not appear in my list of wallets. The wallets to which the funds where sent to shows to be created at the same time frame as when I sent the money. Coinbase is not answering, whenver I call I get an automated message saying to refer to the website. I don't know what to. If anyone has any ideas, please let me know. It is a large sum of money, so if it doesn't get solved I'm going to use legal action.",

I understand that ignorance of the rules isn't an excuse, but guys I genuinely didn't know that burning a chicken casserole was specifically listed as prohibited in the agreement. It's right next to the other prohibited actions, such as using the Coinbase card at a gun store or purchasing a fifteen minute back massage for your wife from the national Massage Envy spa. Massage Envy falls under their rule against using your Coinbase card at massage parlors or prostitutes. Clearly the national chain of massage therapists are the same sucky sucky happy ending establishments downtown.",

            "selftext": "Coinbase locked my entire account because of a technical glitch whereby instant deposit didnt go through. I tried depositing $400 bucks via instant deposit and somehow it didnt go through. Instead of allowing me to redeposit, they froze my entire account (which is funded beyond $400) and then wont let me withdraw, transfer or use my coinbase card. Per representatives Coinbase needs to manually review the account and then manually unlock it... but why is this okay if if was a glitch? Also, I tried re-funding right away and after a day, the cash was withdrawn from my bank account\n\nIt's quite pathetic since i had my cash locked up at Coinbase, and they are holding my entire account hostage. I feel like this is illegal. I wish I could get in touch with customer service.\n\nPlease let me know what i can do to unfreeze my account. I need the cash to use.",
