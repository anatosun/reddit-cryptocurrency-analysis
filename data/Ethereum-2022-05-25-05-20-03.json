Bitcoin currently uses sha-256 for its algorithm. There\u2019s also sha-512 and it acts exactly as sha-256. Except for the size. I think some argued that the bigger bitcoin becomes the need for sha-512 becomes stronger. \n\nIn my opinion, bitcoins biggest competitor will do everything Bitcoin does and have sha-512 built in.

Easy code maintainability is a key efficiency measure. Code is for human beings, so that it's readable. Machines don't read code anyway: it reads the compiled version. That's why code is comment itself and needs to be self explanatory and easy to read. \n\nhttp://blog.cleancoder.com/\n\nNotably, follow the SOLID principles as much as you can.",

But with the \"fiddle around in the console\" method, the tests are only in your head, and they disappear after you run them. That wastes your time, confuses you, and loses your work, when it could be sticking around and alerting you if you accidentally break something later.\n\nThis is also true in Java or whatever, but it's particularly true with smart contract code because you should have only a little bit of code, with clearly defined APIs, and if the code is buggy then that's really, really bad because you can't usually patch it.\n\nWrite the basic tests first - I personally find python nicer than JavaScript or Solidity for writing tests in, but whatever works for you. Then write code that passes them, then fill out the tests for edge cases and things (or do that first too)",
