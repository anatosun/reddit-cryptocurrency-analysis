This enables devs to conduct\u00a0realistic deployment testing\u00a0before making updates to the actual mainnet.\n\nThe Ropsten testnet Merge will see the proof-of-work network combined with a new proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus layer testnet, with its genesis set for May 30. It will simulate what will happen once the actual Merge between Ethereum and the Beacon Chain finally takes place and it\u00a0becomes a PoS network.\n\nDevs in the community have been posting their bullishness about the testnet news online. Preston Van Loon, an Ethereum core developer at Prysmatic Labs said that..\n\nRead full Article  [https://techyno.com/huge-testing-milestone-for-ethereum-ropsten-testnet-merge-set-for-june-8/](https://techyno.com/huge-testing-milestone-for-ethereum-ropsten-testnet-merge-set-for-june-8/)",

Since they announced the TTD of the fork, I've seen the projected merge date move between 6/3 through 6/18.\n\nBecause of the way the merge works, this fork is not based on a block number, rather it's based on the total difficulty of the chain. Normally, when forks happen on a given block number, the time is fairly easy to pin down because increases in hashing power are compensated by adjustments to the difficulty required per block, and the time between blocks stays pretty stable.\n\nBut just basing it on the total difficulty means that time adjustment doesn't happen. If hashing power increases or decreases, the merge time gets closer or further away. And Ropsten has incredibly variable hashing power. It's often just got a handful of CPU miners, and a single GPU miner can increase the hashing power by an order of magnitude.",

So maybe don't start until the Ropsten beacon chain is up?",
