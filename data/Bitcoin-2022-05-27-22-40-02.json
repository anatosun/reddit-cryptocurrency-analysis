When they say \"main network\" they might mean \"Bitcoin is a fork!! Ours fork is real Bitcoin!!\". \n\nWhatever the case when people talk this way you can be assured that they're lying and acting fraudulently.\n\nBitcoin is Bitcoin. There is no \"Main network\" it's just Bitcoin.\n\n>  They even say that if you use a fork you\u2019ll lose your money and they won\u2019t refund.\n\nThat's because bcash failed to change their address format and created a situation where the people they duped into buying their forked version of \"Bitcoin\", thought they had bought Bitcoin and would send it to Bitcoin addresses. At which point they'd discover they had been scammed and actually bought bcash.\n\nWhat's the site? Will be easier to just glance at it and see what's actually going on.",
