Quoted me at X amount, and I received $52 less... the spread fee cost me almost 4x more than it would have cost to do the same trade on coinbase pro. Don't believe the \"free trial\", because a single trade could still cost you more than the monthly membership due to the horrible spread fees.\n\nEdit: I forgot to include that it doesn't tell you what the spread fees may be too, so you just have no idea until you complete the transaction.",
