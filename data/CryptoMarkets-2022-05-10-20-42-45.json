            "selftext": "Over the last year, I'm spending a lot of time and effort researching and learning about NFTs and their use cases and for me, a NFT is a lot more than just a JPEG of a random monkey or punk image. We can use NFTs for many things and this is basically the approach [Unique Network](https://unique.network/) and Quartz are taking. Ternoa is another cool project and they launched the concept of inheritability and data transmission over an NFT network and NFT tokens.\n\nThe thing is - beyond the current very simple use cases for NFTs lies a whole new universe of possibilities and pretty much-unlimited potential. From real estate to healthcare and blockchain gaming, those who truly understand the power of NFTs know that when you dig deeper into the potential of this technology, a lot more is possible and one of these things is **re-fungibility!**\n\n**Fungible vs. Non-fungible: What does it mean?**\n\nMost of us who have even merely dipped our toes into NFTs should at the very least know that they stand for non-fungible tokens.\n\nNon-fungible means a particular asset is unique and non-divisible. One of one means one of one, and so on, regardless if it is a physical object or a digital image.\n\nWe can think of a non-fungible token as a deed or title, or ownership; it represents a unique, non-replicable item that only has one owner. A deed to a specific house only can apply to that house, and a ticket to a concert is only good for that one night\u2014once the night is over, the ticket is relatively useless (nostalgia aside). Another term to describe non-fungible is \u201cone of a kind,\u201d hence why valuable, rare NFTs like Bored Apes and Cryptopunks garner million-dollar price tags. Scarcity vs. supply and demand is the name of the game.\u00a0\n\nFungible tokens, on the other hand, are divisible and non-unique. In the case of currency, which is fungible, a dollar or Bitcoin here is the same as it is there\u2014while the value of one might change, there is nothing particularly unique about the asset once it is issued. Fungible tokens are simply a store of value.\n\n**So what is re-fungibility?**\n\nA re-fungible token (RFT) is essentially a non-fungible token that becomes fungible again. Re-fungibility opens up a whole new world of possibilities for NFTs with a unique ability: partial ownership. You may have heard about the \u201cfractional ownership\u201d of NFTs, which is when an NFT smart contract is deployed to generate ERC20 (the standard used to create fungible tokens) tokens that are linked to a non-fungible ERC721 token, which is the standard token for NFTs. This allows anyone holding one of the ERC20 tokens to own a percentage of a single NFT, which in recent months has enabled large groups of people (or DAOs) to pool money together to buy extremely expensive digital artworks.\n\nAs such, a valuable asset (e.g., a CryptoPunk worth $1,200,000) may be split between multiple owners and even traded using a traditional exchange trading model with a bid and ask order book implemented for more accurate price discovery.\n\nRe-fungible tokens function rather similarly; they can be minted and then partially transferred to multiple owners. However, in the case of Unique Network, the process of ownership and tokenization is slightly different. Still, re-fungibility allows users to share ownership of a specific token.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nTo create fractional ownership on Ethereum, we need to lock NFTs into smart contracts and split the ERC-721 token into many fractions of ERC-20 tokens. Unfortunately, this can lead to issues with safety and a poor user experience.\n\nQuartz RFTs take a different approach. We don\u2019t have to lock our NFTs in contracts and mint ERC-20 tokens. We can use our native RFT pallet, which allows us to create fractional ownership using native minting. We can then mint RFT tokens from scratch and sell fractional ownership to token holders. It\u2019s a safer and simpler option for our users because they don\u2019t need to use complicated services or create smart contracts. You will be able to create these types of RFTs soon using our UniqueMinter or minting scripts.\n\nWhen creating a collection, the user can choose between creating NFT or RFT collections. After that, they can specify data about the collection (name, description, symbol, attributes) and the number of ownership shares specific to each RFT. Users can create tokens divided into 100,000 shares and then sell them to the community. Each RFT-token holder can re-sell their share or buy more shares of their token.\n\n**Why re-fungible?**\n\nRe-fungibility is an important step toward building real-life models of ownership rights in the blockchain. Often a unique item can be owned by multiple entities in different proportions. The examples of such shared ownership are abundant:\n\n* Real-estate timeshares\n* Co-ownership of art\n* Fractional car ownership\n* Buying portions of land\n\nRe-fungibility allows us to utilize blockchain technology in non-blockchain-specific settings, opening up a nearly limitless array of possibilities for people to benefit from the security and autonomy of blockchain while democratizing access to both real-world and digital assets through renting or sharing pieces of a single asset.\u00a0\n\n\u201cRFTs from Unique Network enable the first native, powerful and user-friendly instruments for fractional ownership.\u201d and \u201cRFTs done natively will drive mass adoption of collective ownership of digital assets.\u201d these are very cool words, right? At least that's what Unique CEO Alexander Mitrovich recently said.\n\nUnique Network believes re-fungibility is an exciting development and extension from the introduction of NFT bridges: If sharing of the ownership is desired, a previously non-fungible token may be made re-fungible once transferred to Unique Chain through a bridge. Together with many of our dynamic NFT features and benefits, we are building and deploying next-generation NFT technology that goes beyond what has been built on Ethereum, Solana, or Tezos. From scalability to complex ownership structures to re-fungibility and flexible ownership models, NFTs on Unique Network goes beyond the limits of the technology today.\u00a0",
