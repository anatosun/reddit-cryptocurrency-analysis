So I\u2019m here to remind you that you have to fight for your #dogecoin Don\u2019t be surprised if you can\u2019t withdraw your coins or if you see a spike in withdrawal fees. The next step is to lower the daily transfer amount. They don\u2019t have it. This is why I called it a war. These are all signs your broker is  \n\nplaying games. \n\n1. Not Providing Proof of Assets For Coin \n\n2. CEO pretends he doesn\u2019t know what it is AND it\u2019s going to (Take some time) to show it. This could be done in minutes \n\n3. The emergence of wrap-around tokens are like crypto dark pools, they\u2019re ready to trade the same crypto back & forth between exchanges at rates they only know the truth on. 1 Doge = 1 Doge? Maybe\u2026Maybe 1 Doge = 5 Doge..because we need to cover these positions we lent out. \n\n4. Lowering of daily withdrawal limits (they need time to account for your #dogecoin) \n\n5. Raising a withdrawal fee (discourages transfers)\n\n6. Cancellations or orders being offline. \n\n7. Fancier New Wallets to encourage you to keep your crypto on the exchange. \n\nThis is not a coincidence. \n\nGet your crypto off of exchanges, there is a war on #dogecoin and I found proof of price manipulation. I also found additional proof in the charts that #dogecoin is not falling organically because of Bitcoin [https://youtu.be/5z1PqXf3al8](https://youtu.be/5z1PqXf3al8)\n\nGet your cold wallet directly from the site and not a 3rd party so they\u2019re no games. [https://shop.ledger.com/?r=01f1d3f5672a](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=01f1d3f5672a)\n\nI hope this information finds you well -\n\nDavid Mitchell Jr",
