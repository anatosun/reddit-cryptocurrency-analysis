My supplier told me it was a new miner that they have no right to open it. I also wanted to know, so last night I asked them to open and take photos to check the condition inside. \n\nIt is amazing!!!!!! god, i absoutely love it. I checked the SN code and it was all correct, I really can't wait to get it. Guys, I will send you the follow-up miner condition when I receive it.  :))))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j49ot0p68zz81.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42d7d101c6daa8c49330aa8c91c3217b769ed0ee\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wyactvq68zz81.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c69320d8304e17ecdcfa6281fcf95b681518cad\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7fglbwq68zz81.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ed9396c101e2ecd2a7e461c2001c1cdf7425e73\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tyd9qvq68zz81.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cfda3466607dca217b70f4670e9177a905bc4998\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zcztvvq68zz81.jpg?width=364&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=33d1e8b5ad42a88a24d365247c98c450f504d197",
