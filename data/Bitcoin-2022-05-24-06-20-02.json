Specifically when he starts getting into how trash modern music and art is. It had me rolling my eyes into the back of my head. \n\nBesides that, the book spends so long jerking off the gold standard system for how amazing it is that you do feel like you're reading a gold bug's book about how gold is great and then by chapter 8 we find out that bitcoin is like gold but better.\n\nIt's a good book for someone who knows nothing of the history of money and knows quite little about bitcoin. It's maybe a good read for OP because it seems like they dont know what they bought or the significance of what they hold, but it's not a good book for someone who's already a bitcoiner.\n\nAll this said, the best bitcoin starter book IMO is \"The Seventh Property\" by Eric Yakes.",

                    "response": "Welcome to the club my friend. \n\nHighly recommend learning more about bitcoin from good sources. There are a lot of bad sources of information about bitcoin out there, including most articles you'll find online when googling \"bitcoin.\"\n\nIf you like reading books check out The Bitcoin Standard\n\nIf you're more into articles this one's a good start [https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1](https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)\n\nI like podcasts and listen to every BTC episode on The Investors Podcast which can be found on Spotify, Youtube, etc. \n\nAnd a few random words of wisdom:\n\n\\-Only buy as much as you feel like you understand and feel like you can sleep at night if the price goes down another 50% from here, unlikely but bitcoin doesn't follow rules which brings me to my next point...\n\n\\-No price targets. Avoid falling into the optimism or pessimism of bitcoin price targets in the near or long term. They're all wrong because no one knows what the future holds. After you've done enough research on bitcoin you will find yourself thinking about the world differently, you'll have a different lens on current events and will feel safe owning bitcoin at any price, low or high. \n\n\\-Be careful trying to sell your friends and family on bitcoin. Many people are not interested or open minded about the bitcoiner's perspective because it first starts with realizing they don't understand what money is or how it works, and second it requires belief that the current economic system is structured wrong, even worse, that it was intentionally structured to benefit those in power at the expense of the common man. This is a hard pill to swallow for many people.\n\n\\-Do some research on hardware wallets and consider storing your own bitcoin instead of letting an exchange store it.",
