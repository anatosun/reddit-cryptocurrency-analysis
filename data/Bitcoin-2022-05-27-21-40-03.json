Are you serious?  That is extremely unlikely.\n\nThe easiness of corruption and leaving the country will brain drain and destroy it.  It will not be strong at all, let alone militarily.  See Russia for example and they are still able to stop fiat transfers.\n\n> These countries decide to go into a war with the countries that adopted bitcoin.\n\nWhy?\n\n> Wouldn't be the countries that are bitcoinfriendly in disadvantage?\n\nYes.  Authoritarian governments are weak because they have no motivation to expand the production of the worker class, it doesn't increase their treasury to distribute to the key supporters.\n\nThis means they have less production and resilience compared to non-authoritarian countries.\n\nThat's a disadvantage.  It has nothing to do with BTC though.\n\n> I think they would be, because the military of those countries would be smaller.\n\nYes.  Smaller countries are disadvantaged, which is why your assumption of 'are authoritarian with strong militaries' is wrong.  \n\nBut you stated that assumption so how is the strong millitary smaller exactly?  You are contradicting yourself.",
