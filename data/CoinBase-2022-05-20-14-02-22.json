We can tell the \u201cofficial\u201d Coinbase Reddit account is just for show. \n\nIf the account had been following anything or was at least partially aware they would know: Coinbase hasn\u2019t paid Tezos staking SINCE MARCH 30 to ALL Coinbase customers.  Since the last tezos chain upgrade. \n\nThis is not some \u201clet me help you by following up on your ticket\u201d bullshit. Coinbase has replied to several customers and there have been several posts about this. \u201cCoinbase knows there an issue and will pay you for all interest owed. We are keeping track\u201d\nHonestly if Coinbase doesn\u2019t have the technical team to fix this minor issue in two months, I\u2019m not sure I want them ti be my exchange. They could have any reason: too busy, hiring, securing  funding for crypto winter, whatever. It doesn\u2019t matter, I fail to understand how they cannot fix this. The rest of the tezos ecosphere is unaffected and paying staking rewards.  Why pay Coinbase their high staking fees, if they can\u2019t even fix a problem in two months? \n\nCome on Coinbase. Do better.",
