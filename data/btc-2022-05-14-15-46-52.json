There is also the thought that people will move all into crypto if USDT fails so the price of BTC may moon and all other cryptos for that matter.  I think the strat is to get in crypto that has the least exposure to USDT.  That could be bch but there are so many bots arbitraging off of BTC that bch pretty much goose steps with BCT.  Most all crypto for that matter. \n\nLong story short, I don\u2019t know and nobody else does either save the few financially elite that are most likely playing the same game just digitally now.",
