So would the exchange potentially wait until 10 or 20 people withdrawal their crypto before submitting the request to the blockchain?  Is this even possible to for the exchange to do this to save them for paying for gas fees for each of their retail investor withdrawals?\n\nThanks!",

Building an even better reputation, co-founder, Vitalik donated USDC$4M (stablecoin), which approximately converts to $5.3 million.\n\n It is understood to be the largest-known cryptocurrency given to an Australian high education institution.  The donation was received to support EPIWATCH, an open-source intelligence (OSINT) tool developed by UNSW Kirby Institute\u2019s Professor Raina MacIntyre.  EPIWATCH development began in 2016 and strengthened extensive research and testing. The said tool works by scanning millions of items of publicly available online data, such as social media and news reports, to spot epidemics far faster than formal reporting from national laboratories and doctors.  For the tool to be most productive, it needs to be accessible in local languages and utilized widely at the grassroots level down to villages and small towns around the world. Will this really give the best prospect of preventing pandemics and improve Ethereum adoption?",

And at that point, you're to believe Lido that they will maintain the service. It's been shut down more than once, now, due to Terra shutting down. If Terra can't be saved, which would be extremely surprising, there are big reasons for them to shutdown the network. Once done, you're left with nothing. \n\nClearly, it's not up to you whether you get something in the end. It's up to them. All this can happen way before the merge and you'd have no way out.",

A benefit of a lower price is that it reduces the cost of entry for solo stakers. In any case if fewer people stake then the APR goes up for the people who do, so you get an equilibrium somewhere.\n\nOne problem right now is that you can't sell, but you're still (probably) incurring a tax liability whenever you make an attestation or a proposal. This is a bit scary when the price is volatile, for instance if you were staking all last year then in a lot of countries you probably now owe more tax on the revenue than the revenue you earned is worth. Hopefully it won't be too long until withdrawals are working - it should be the first hard fork after the merge, and the merge is getting close.",

It makes them resistant to censorship, yes, but at the cost of severely limiting their growth potential and therefore their overall liquidity across DeFi. \n\nVesta (VST) improves on this by allowing more collateral types, but the underlying design of LUSD/VST is still limited by the redemption mechanism. Users have to be extremely overcollateralized in order to avoid a vault/trove redemption and this limits the capital efficiency of the protocol. It does, however, make for an extremely strong peg mechanism.",

So as i've given up on that im mostly looking around to see of an entry way of building eth in the background so that i can afford other things past bills. Due to the job i work only being enough to pay rent and food i dont and havent had money for what seems like years now.

The best paying one with no investment I've found is Coin Hunt World.\n\nAnother way, if you don't mind doing the KYC, is to check which exchanges have a learn and earn, and sign up for an account. Usually you watch a video or read an article about a random coin and you get a couple USD worth of that coin. You can then either HODL it or swap it for whatever you want.\n\nThere are ways to get free crypto but it will be small amounts that you are getting and you'll have to be creative with how and where you get it from. If you're willing to put in the time you could accumulate a couple thousand USD worth of eth in a year.",

For one - Solana may in fact be worse than Ethereum, whose to say? By the standards of their own dev team, it\u2019s still in Beta. \n\nFor another, it\u2019s not a fair comparison - the PoS consensus is not the attack vector exploited in the recent attacks on Solana. The network wasn\u2019t having a hard time arriving at consensus, it went completely offline because the node leader was overwhelmed with traffic. Other PoS chains do not have this vulnerability, and Ethereum will not have it either (as far as I know). \n\nLastly - I think if you want to actually discuss PoS vs PoW, it would be helpful to bring actual concrete arguments instead of just lazily echoing parts of the talking points PoW advocates most often trot out. Just saying \u201cit\u2019s less secure\u201d does nothing for anyone. Why, exactly, do you think it\u2019s less secure? What do PoS advocates have to say in response? Why are they wrong?",

I asked why they don't want to change to PoW?\n\nBitcoin IS POW. WTF? Get your shit sorted then get back to me. Okay? \n\nThey don't want it to change because they have this fallacy of drawing value from the fact that it stays the same, first one and the only true coin (or some BS like that) when in reality, ETH and everything else have overtaken it. ETH on its own have all the functionality that BTC has now and then a whole. lot. more. \n\nEven their lead dev at some point conceded that the 21 mil cap will not work nor the current block size. Again, the BTC community don't want any of that to change either for the same reasons.\n\nWhen their following hits the wall (and they will), it might be too late then to adopt any kind of change quick enough to turn things around.",

We can even forgo using a carriage completely and simply go on with the car given a car can do all that a carriage can do and then some.

The fact the merge has been delayed so many times makes me think they are highly focused on security and won\u2019t do it until they believe they can be successful. In the video I posted, the guy was talking about them dropping a difficulty bomb soon and potentially increasing block times to 20-25 seconds ahead of the merge.

Why do you think ETH will be more secure with POS than it currently is?\n\n[The cost of maintaining consensus is not sustainable in POW.](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/4/20682109/bitcoin-energy-consumption-annual-calculation-cambridge-index-cbeci-country-comparison). Whereas, POS is almost entirely just capital cost and the inconvenience of the \"lock up\" while staking. So unlike hardware equipment that depreciate, coins staked (providing you didn't do any slashable/punishable acts while staking) are returned back. 1 ETH = 1 ETH.\n\nLet's take 51% attacks which remains possible for both types of chain (POS and POW). \n\nWith POW, you pretty much need to wait for the attacker to stop. That or you can keep watch until it keeps on getting attacked 'til the chain is rendered useless. Miners have no way to get rewards as the attack is going on. If you fork to defend against an attack on an ASIC dominated chain (e.g. BTC), you don't only \"brick\" the attackers hardware but also the hardware of the honest miners.\n\nWith ETH POS, there is slashing mechanism that is built right within the consensus itself. This renders the attacker's (and notably no one else's) stake to get automatically destroyed. Moreover, the remaining honest validators can invoke a UASF that again destroys the attacker's funds. The initial attack would cost a really large penalty on its own while the chain can be up and running again (without needing to wait for the attack/further attacks to stop). The attacker will need to replenish his/her funds to be able to perform the next subsequent attacks and will be met by the same slashing mechanism like the initial one.\n\n#Now... your turn. Why is POW more secure than POS?",

New tech gets introduced regularly with it getting more and more efficient. A state like the US can simply freeze new supply of silicon from (let's say TSMC) and devote it to such an exercise... all covert of course. What then?\n\nLike I said, in POW, you will need to wait until the attacker stops to even start thinking of any repair or rescue. Even when that happens... all (even the honest consensus participants - in this case miners) will have their hardware bricked.\n\nLastly, you failed to acknowledge the built-on slasher on ETH POS. The attacker on ETH POS may successfully attack the chain, burn all his/her funds, but still fail to shutdown/take over the chain. It's a world where the world can be attacked and burned but there's Avengers to avenge it... always.

I confirmed the transaction, the screen loaded and then said there was an error. When I view the transaction hash, the funds were sent to the Dai contract.\n\nI never copied or saw that Dai contract address on any of my screens. There was no place for me to even copy it, ever. Yet after pasting in my Metamask address, that contract address was somehow inserted instead and I saw an error message. Now all my funds are lost to the Ether and sent to a contract instead of my wallet.\n\nHas this ever happened to anyone? Am I completely delusional?

When the [2018 great crypto crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_bubble#2017_boom_and_2018_crash) happened, I panicked like a noob and fully divested from crypto. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

So on net, his influence has decreased as a share of the total pie.\n\nVarious interest groups have starting showing more influence in the governing of Ethereum. Consensys, Paradigm/Flashbots etc. The various rollups also have an interest in helping Ethereum conform to a rollup centric roadmap, as evidenced by EIP-4488. People from these organizations are all quite active in community and have quite a bit to say about the future of the chain.\n\nAlso I suspect the various validating pools for Eth 2.0 to become powerful voices in Ethereum governance, such as Lido and Rocket Pool. Their financial interest is directly tied to chain governance.\n\nThis isn't to say any of this is good or bad, but things do change, as you would expect in a decentralized system.",

I found there are always some obstacles on the way to web3.\n\nEach time I want to introduce web3/ethereum to my friends, and some might get interested, but they have lots of questions on the concepts of almost everything about web3, like the relationship between accounts in metamask, and how to import other mnemonics, how to sell ETH,etc.Then u need to answer their questions one by one endlessly. I'm tire of seeking the answer for each question, actually  some of them are in deed tricky, for example, without some knowledge about bip44, you will get confused why you delete an account but it's not deleted, it's just hide on metamask. And there are lots of situation which differents from web2.\n\nSo I asked myself ,is metamask really a good app to introduce to my friends? is it enough that I could say , just start with metamask and you and explore from here? The answer is no, so I wondered if there is an app which works like a WINDOW/Gateway to web3, not just a wallet that only keep assetes and sign transactions but also answer your questions and lead you to next step to your destination.\n\nI still don't find it, if any one know something like it pls tell me. Anyway while I was finding the app, I had some ideas and embarked on it. It will be a novice-friendly application, the goal of it is that, I can introduce it to my friends and say, look, just play with it, and you will understand most of web3, and find your interest things.\n\nI'll appreciate if any of u have any suggestion/advice or met any questions as I did while preaching web3 or blockchain. I'm happy to communicate anytime. At last, leave ur address, thx for ur help once I made it, anyway, probably nothing\ud83d\ude00.",

Even the ones that make massive sacrifice to decentralization can't keep up and still go down. It's been years of various L1s testing various design and they all inevitably run into the same problems the minute they get some real usage. And this is *today's* idea of \"real usage\". Tomorrow's idea of it involves orders of magnitude more usage if you truly want global adoption.\n\nThe ones with the best chances are the ones who focus on a modular experience with different layers focused for different things.\n\n>For this reason why use Ethereum with crazy high gas fees that force you into using an L2 basically? \n\nBecause L2 is the way to go if you want fast, cheap, secure and decentralized. It's the best way to use Ethereum's secure but very expensive blockspace most efficiently. Instead of one transaction using 200,000 gas and being very expensive, you have an L2 batching your transaction with thousands of others so that in the end you indirectly pay for 100-500 L1 gas.",

All other forms of layer 2s (state channels, plasma, side chains) do not inherit the security of the base layer.\n\nRollups have the same economic security as the base layer and that's huge. Everything is still stored on-chain, just in a compressed form.\n\nInstead of storing every single transaction on-chain, you compute the final state of the system after applying a ton of transactions. Then you publish the final state along with a proof that the computation is correct.\n\nThe base layer only needs to verify the proof.

It's by definition not the case in a trustless environment, because no one knows the hair color of a wallet. It's just a wallet. \n\nIt's so trustless you don't even know if one wallet isn't just owned by the same person as another wallet. Or even if one wallet isn't owned by more than one person.\n\nBy trying to force people to be evenly distributed into all activities, you're considering people to be yours slaves you have a right to move among activities at your convenience. It's a freedom problem. \n\nYou're also trying to remove the specialization advantage of people at the tasks they prefer to do. It's a market efficiency problem.\n\nStop doing that. You're hurting others. Focus on maintaining trustlessness and developping as many services as possible within it. It will do the rest for you.",

If many people want to burn their tokens into a single smart contract, it's because they want to. \n\nDon't worry, this kind of events can't happen for long anyway. Any minute where blocks are full, gas price is multiplied by ~10. You can guess they can't do that for long, for they're going to run out of tokens pretty fast. If people really want to burn their tokens, to each their own.\n\n>There are many mainstream news outlets that are publishing articles titled , ethereum broke/crashed . As far I understand Ethereum worked as designed . However i agree that the situation was not ideal for mainstream adoption.\n\nIndeed, Ethereum didn't crash and wasn't broken and mainstream news outlets will use whatever they want to deny the usefulness of crypto in general. Even fallacies. Even that crypto is used to launder money, with the double standard fallacy that they're completely fine with the fact fiat is also used to launder money. So, let's not change anything just to please them, because the only thing that would please them is as much drama as possible with crypto ending up burning to ashes (pun intended). \n\n>Couldn\u2019t the developer opt for a lottery like scheme where they accept everybody\u2019s bid for the nft over a couple of weeks and then allocate the nfts randomly? That could have avoided the sudden rush . Right ?\n\nYes, better ways to develop smart contracts are possible. And I agree several better solutions should be preferred. But if people want to burn their own tokens, it's something I'm completely fine with. They won't stop the network by doing so anyway. At least not for long at all. And once they're done, they're out of money and won't matter, having essentially given their wealth to everyone else in the process.",

And to send it back you need the private key or the seed it was derived from for that private address.\n\nIf you have a wallet at coinbase or kraken or any exchange, they generate the address and key in the background and manage it for you (that's why they are the custodians). So, as long as they use this address for your account and accept deposits, they must also have the key. Hence, they should be - in theory - able to send the ERC20 back to your other address.\n\nHowever, there is no function in their API or on their website for that, so someone would have to do it manually. So, your only options are \n\na) ask nicely and hope someone at coinbase responds\n\nb) a lot more unlikely: they implement ERC20 support for their customers' wallets at some point AND you can still use the same address then. However, I can see several reasons why this is not going to happen.",

In a long time, sharding will allow for higher TPS, but we're clearly not there.\n\nBesides, lower gas price doesn't mean people want less ETH, since the demand for gas isn't fixed. It notably means even more use cases can be covered, which means even more people will want to burn some ETH.\n\nETH tokens provide an access to a world computer. Have you seen computing power demand decrease over time? No, it is rather increasing over time. It's pretty safe to assume the demand for gas will increase over time as well.\n\nBesides, ETH also is an investment into a consensus that rewards its actors. This also drives its price up.\n\nAnd the fact it will become way less inflationary than fiat (to the point of being momentarily deflationary) ensures it will protect long term against the monetary inflation of fiat currencies.",

To lower the fees other chains make trade-offs on the scalability trillema\n2. Ethereum's solution to the scalability trilemma is rollups and data sharding.

Houses are dirt cheap and streets have no traffic in a rural Wyoming town, but that doesn't mean everyone currently living in NYC will move there. If they did, it wouldn't take long for that town to get just as bad as NYC, if not worse, since the infrastructure can't handle it.\n\nAnd ss more and more money flows into the ethereum ecosystem, Layer 1 by itself would be like everyone insisting on having their own car and detached house in Manhattan. That's clearly not sustainable and something will break sooner or later. Layer 2 is like introducing buses and trains and high rise buildings. Suddenly you can fit orders of magnitude more people to partake in the economic activity on top of the same limited amount of land as before. The land is still extremely expensive, but the individual cost of living on it is spread out over way more people.",

Is it possible to bridge Arbitrum NFTs to the Ethereum main layer? If yes, will those NFTs still be \"Arbitrum\" NFTs - or Ethereum NFTs? What are other implications of bridging (e.g. are they still stored on IPFS)? Still can't wrap my head around it.\n2. If yes, is there an Arbitrum NFT bridge to Ethereum, similar to what Polygon offers [https://bridge.mintnft.today/](https://bridge.mintnft.today/)\n3. Can you recommend marketplaces that allow minting of new NFTs on Arbitrum?\n\nIf you have any hints or could point me to useful resources, I would really appreciate that!\n\nthank you!",

I've been going over different plans lately and I now have a plan we can go with in an attempt to create this free society and make this dream a reality.\n\nI'm putting together a list of abandoned offshore oil rigs that could be a good starting point for us, we might have to start with something small that we could manage and then move on from there and do something bigger and more expensive like an island. By starting with offshore oil rigs we have something we can actually work towards instead of wasting time. Once we get to the oil rig we can set up something similar to the Sealand micronation. Our offshore rig will be a beacon of freedom to everyone across the world and it will help our project gain a lot of attention. We can upgrade the rig and have over 100 people living on it out at sea. We will be free from overbearing governments out there and be free to do whatever we want. It will be our HQ and from there we can make plans to expand.\n\nI will be starting an application for interested individuals. I will put together a crew of people interested in going to the oil rig and I will pay for travel to and occupation of the oil rig with my crypto holdings.\n\nI find it's better to ask for peoples time when it comes to projects like this instead of asking for peoples money. What I\u2019ve noticed is not everyone has money so that\u2019s where a lot of \u201cstart my own island/nation/society\u201d plans have failed because people ask the public for money to fund it. And then funding goals either aren\u2019t reached or people are skeptical wondering if it\u2019s a scam so all of that ends up being wasted energy. I\u2019d rather move people to the society using my own crypto funds and just ask people for their commitment. If you can actually find people committed to building a new free society that is something you can use to find success. This is just one way of doing it though so I\u2019m open to exploring other ideas.\n\nOnce we have control of the oil rig we can set it up as a sovereign nation and collaborate with different crypto companies so they can base their operations there. By founding our free society on pro crypto ideals we will attract a lot of high worth crypto businesses and generate billions in revenue for our new free society. We can then use that to expand and soon enough having our own island will be a reality.\n\nIf you're interested in being one of the people that goes to the offshore oil rig leave a comment here or send me a dm. I'll also be posting the application soon so we can have everything organized.",

Geniuses have brought techs and worked hard for it; individuals, not a collective. It's so disrespectful to take away their hard work and claim it's due to \"America\". And America has certainly not provided any proof that different cultures can work together: islands have proven that way, way before them and have lots of different cultural food blends to prove it. America has mostly proven several cultures can coexist with each others while also killing each others and hating each others in a very conflictual society. Such prowess... \n\n>If theres something i would really want to change\n\nYou don't have any voice in how anything will be changed. At all. At best, you've got a tiny vote to decide who will rule, among a very few people who have absolutely not your interest at heart. \n\nAnd even if you had full power to decide who among them will rule over you, you'd only be able to decide who will be able to profit at your expense. It's the concept of a political oligopoly. Like any oligopoly, it ends up with collusion, without even needing any kind of secret meeting or hidden agenda. That's representative democracy.\n\n>What laws would you have for self defense? Would you require publicly streamed body cams at all times?\n\nThat's an interesting question. I'm not OP, but I can answer for myself how such a system could work. \n\nIt's actually not very complex and not much is changed on the matter of how things are handled on a daily basis. You'd just have to reverse the dependency of laws: people answer about whatever laws they want and select whatever court they want to handle the cases where they're suspects and whatever punishment they're ready to face. And then, based on that, anyone else decides whether they accept them or not on their properties, which ensures no one with incompatible law systems is close to each others. So, rather than paying a system to sue others, you rather pay a system to be able to be sued by others, because it allows you to prove your sense of responsibility, so that others can trust you enough to agree on living close to you. \n\nIcing on the cake, you also have the concept of transferable torts that allows people to benefit from such services without even having to pay for it, because they can renounce to a part of their torts that are instead paid to the people who handle them. \n\nTo be noted, this also allows for justice systems that aren't incentivized to be more lenient to wealthy people, unlike our current system. There's nothing to corrupt anymore with money because there's no public representation to corrupt. \n\nThough, again, I don't know how OP would want it to be handled, but the concept of polycentric laws isn't new and is generally well tied to most projects of free societies.",

But it really isn't that technologically advanced tbh, it's really just a protocol/distributed system with a clever usage of cryptography. And the cryptography is basic stuff that's been around for a long time. Not that big of a deal on paper.\n\nGood engineers also don't really care about how \"technologically advanced\" something is, they look at technology as a means to end to solve problems, and they analyze implications of decisions very deeply. Many of the best engineers are very critical of the tech, because they look past the \"shininess\" and evaluate technology from many different angles and on many different timelines, and find deep flaws when considering building a society on top of this technology (which is how blockchain enthusiasts envision the future)  \n\n\nI still love it, but I think Jack's single point of failure comment is really worth thinking about. Imagine the merge (written by a small handful of people) introduces a significant bug, and the ENTIRE WORLD depends on the system for EVERYTHING. It's something to consider.",

It's the Windows of Blockchains.\n\nAdditionally, PoW is significantly more attractive for me, because I can easily earn passive income by helping secure the chain. Every holder can participate and earn. Not just those who can afford incredibly expensive mining equipment. Our children and grandchildren will probably thank us for setting them up with passive income (through staking) for the rest of their lives, just like those families whose parents and grandparents bought real estate in the 60s, 70s and 80s.",

The goal is to answer to the question: ***\u201cIn which ways artists can leverage Digital Marketing activities to sell & advertise their artworks in the NFT new paradigm\"?***\n\nThe advancements around NFT artworks, blockchain technology, and crypto currencies have the potential to have a profound influence on the dynamics that have defined the art market for decades, especially regarding the value and ownership of the work of artists. According to Gartner's Hype Cycle for Critical Technologies of 2021, NFTs based on their unique characteristics have the potential to dramatically revolutionize digital marketing functions and techniques. In this context, artists considering the use of NFTs should consequently be aware of the marketing opportunities and their consequences. Indeed, interesting new marketing techniques need to be discovered and understood.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to lay the foundation for this new creation by demonstrating how the combination of art and marketing in the digital era might be reflected in the NFT world.\n\nIn this context, **I built the following questionnaire**: [**https://neoma.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_3z4NzYt7ckh5xrM**](https://neoma.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3z4NzYt7ckh5xrM)\n\n*If you are interested to be part of the study, please answer to the questionnaire.*\n\nThe goal is to gather experiences and perspectives from everyone participating in the NFT ecosystem, including artists, enthusiasts, collectors, and investors.\n\nThe survey is divided into four sections. This first section discusses your thoughts on NFTs and how you have used them and intend to use them in the future. As a Crypto enthusiast, the second part will examine your behavior and relationship with NFT Art and NFT marketplaces. The third section will examine your behavior and experiences as an NFT artist. Finally, the fourth section will examine digital marketing techniques that artists are currently using or will be using in the future to promote their work in the NFT world, comparing them to traditional and digital art market techniques.\n\nThis survey will take approximately 15-25 minutes, so be sure to get a beverage and give your best ideas on the subject. Your responses will be used for a master\u2019s thesis that discusses how Crypto Art and NFTs are transforming artists' digital marketing operations. As a sidenote, the survey results will be anonymous.\n\nIf you have more in-depth comments or suggestions, please email me at [*anthony.galasso.19@neoma-bs.com*](mailto:anthony.galasso.19@neoma-bs.com) with any informations you would like to share.\n\nThank you for your time!\n\n\\-*Anthony Galasso, master's student at NEOMA Business School, photographer & NFT artist*",

The most frightening part is that anytime these are brought up, they're rapidly dismissed with an ever worsening set of talking points by ethereans.\n\n[https://blockworks.co/crypto-exchange-uniswap-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-alleging-wrongdoing/](https://blockworks.co/crypto-exchange-uniswap-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-alleging-wrongdoing/)\n\n*#DINO* seems like it should be trending again soon (Decentralized In Name Only). This class-action has enormous implications for altcoins, not just because of the liability it exposes faux decentralized projects to, but because of the securities angle. The only thing worse than an unfavorable judgement would be UniSwap settling out of court. That would be a blow even the most ardent believers in the protocol couldn't handle.\n\nETH is emerging as little more than a gas token which acts as an all-access pass once a user reaches the web3 mansion gates. Inside what awaits them is an orgy of swaps, wraps, burns, mints, and stakes, run by centralized dapps that do nothing but optimize token interactions to keep the orgy going. And the only things that has established themselves as money in the protocol are stablecoins. That's why 85% of the  Ethereum Network's volume is STABLECOINS. That's an example of *Gresham's Law* at work:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s\\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law)\n\nStablecoins track the price of fiat, meaning they'll blow up along with it. That's what LUNA's UST finally realized. Point is, with the Ripple lawsuit approaching completion this year and giving the SEC legal precedent, along with the disastrous revelations of the last 60 days of how easily governments coerced dapps to comply, along with what's certain to be an avalanche of lawsuits, it's time to consider the s-curve adoption shakeout for the crypto space is rapidly approaching. Lastly, there are rumors that the most recent Merge delay has a few law firms collecting names to sue ETH developers on behalf of clients who locked up ETH in the Beacon Chain. It's time to dump ETH.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/MadMaxi/comments/u5skm7/stanford\\_universitys\\_paper\\_on\\_proofofstake\\_makes/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadMaxi/comments/u5skm7/stanford_universitys_paper_on_proofofstake_makes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)",

People are loosing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto \\*\\* every month \\*\\* by following your advice.  I thought Mt. Gox exchange was safe until it crashed and took hundreds of millions of dollars with it in 2014. Scammers has only gotten better since then.

If you understand that those things are then you know why BTC doesn't fix them. This is like claiming html fixes faxes. \n\nCentral banks will still exist. Fiat isn't going anywhere. New asset classes and utilities won't change that especially once CBDCs are exist ubiquitously. BTC replacing the dollar is like going back to the gold standard... Perhaps less cumbersome with the fixed supply, but just as constricting to the US. \n\nThat isn't to say there isn't value in BTC as a means of storing or moving value, just like there is value in what's termed as \"smart contracts\" and even NFTs. In fact these technologies have the advantage over BTC in that they could help make banking more transparent, easier to access and more strict adherence to a publicly known policy. \n\nAgain I don't get maxis.",

Do you think that this blockchain is suitable for light P2E game (because of the fees and how it functions with the P2E games);\n\n2. Is this blockchain a good start for new P2E games (possible partnerships, fundings, etc) or is there a better blockchain for this occassion (in case you believe that some blockchain is going to have a big wave of P2E games or any wave that can help a new P2E that is going to be created on it)?\n\n3. If you were me,\n\nhaving an idea for a P2E game with already made up tokenomics, roadmap and whitepaper - so just missing on the technical (picking of the blockchain and implementation of that game) and launchpads part (where would you try to 'push' your game in so you can be visible and attract more people with launchpad), \n\nwhich blockchain and/or launchpads would you pick and why?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease, suggest me other blockchain if you find it more suitable and write why did you pick them (for example because of the fees, launchpads, process of integrating game with that blockchain or something else).\n\nAlso, feel free to tell me if I am missing anything else that is important for the start or if you would change anything here :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks you! :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.

Until Loopring develops its own EVM compatible vm, it\u2019s literally just a DEX.\nPolygon on the other hand is way more EVM compatible.\n\nSo far Loopring has been a \u201cwait for more development and you\u2019ll see\u201d kind of project that isn\u2019t contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem nearly as much as Polygon is.\n\nPolygon is a completely functional network with more than 10,000 dApps on board, a lot of which are of very high quality.\nThis offers A LOT more value to the Ethereum network and community and invites more and more builders to Ethereum.\n\nPolygon is an overall way more versatile projects that Ethereum can actually benefit from. It has one of the most diverse ecosystems on the market and can still help Ethereum with traffic just as good as Loopring can.\n\nThe only difference is that Loopring is strictly an L2 and thats it. Nothing more nothing less. So I just hate it when some supporters tend to over exaggerate how amazing of a project Loopring really is. Its not a leader in any sector in the market nor has it innovated anything new so far.",

This means that they would need > 22 million ether.\n\nAt today's price that would cost just a little over $70 billion.\n\nAccording to GOBankingRates Blackrock is worth $69.15 billion [https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/business/how-much-is-blackrock-worth/]\n\nSo if they could borrow the equivalent of their entire company's net worth...\n\n... and we don't take into account that buying >20 % of the entire supply of an asset is likely to push up the price somewhat...\n\nThen maybe they can just afford the attack?\n\nBut that's just the start. In order to carry out the attack they would need to get all of that ether into validators and onto the Beacon chain. This is done via a queuing system and only 5 validators can be added per epoch (so 5 * 32 ether).\n\nAn epoch takes around 6.4 minutes, so 1,125 validators can be added per day.\n\nThe attacker needs to onboard about 690,000 validators, so in the best possible circumstances it would take them around 600 days to get them all into The Beacon Chain...\n\n... but that's assuming no one else is trying to onboard their own validators, which is a strange assumption to make as the queue is basically always backlogged, there's currently about 11 days worth (12,705) of validators in the queue and no sign of that slowing down [https://beaconscan.com/validators#pending]\n\nBut lets be nice and assume that all the good actors in the system kindly stop adding validators and twiddle our thumbs while Blackrock buy 20% of the ether supply and then spend 2 years queueing validators. At that point they would have devastating control of the transactions on the network. They could censor addresses, block transfers etc etc. It would be a disaster...\n\n... for a while...\n\nEthereum doesn't have on-chain governance, your stake lets you validate and attest blocks, but it doesn't give you voting power over protocol changes or anything, that's done via soft consensus on dev calls, discussion forums and with community sentiment. Ethereum governance is fluffy, which to some people outside seems weak, but in serious attacks like this makes it incredibly powerful.\n\nThe nuclear option is always there to just fork out the attacker. It would be trivially easy to see which validators are proposing blocks including censorship, and the 66% of attesters that are voting for them. With these identified client updates could be pushed out that cause these validators to be ignored, effectively they would no longer exist. Normal validators would update Lighthouse/Prysm/Teku/whatever and carry on the chain free from interference. The attacker could chose not to update their clients, but they are then just building a chain for themselves to play with.\n\nThe end result would be:\n\n* Blackrock would have lost assets worth at least $70 Billion (their entire net worth)\n\n* Ether would have deflated by 20% (yay for price action)\n\n* Bitcoin maxi's like Kratter would make videos crying about 'immutability'\n\nHope that helps you understand why Proof of Stake is a security upgrade, regardless of how people who don't understand it what to portray otherwise.",

At any point in time, they have the choice to have their own crypto. It's just that what miners want is to have users, because they have costs and users pay costs because users are their clients. But users choose where they want to be too. So miners follow them, because that's what they want. \n\nIt's the same with platforms: platforms need users because they have costs. Some platforms can try to influence users. But in the end, it's always each person choosing wherever they want to be.\n\nIf a platform decides not to provide a service on one branch of a fork, be sure someone else will copy paste the platform into the other branch to profit from such unreasonable economical choice.",

If some institutions don't want to take the profit, they'll just fall behind other institutions which will want to profit. \n\nWake up, \"the community\", it's many people in many countries, now. It's not a little world anymore. Don't expect many other retail investors to join the party: they have already joined the party. \n\nBut if some other people want to have their centralized fork, they can all they want. No one will forbid them.

The rest of the world follows the institutions because most people won't even be aware of the issue, and even if they are, they'll hardly have a choice in the matter because the exchanges aren't going to give people that choice. Regulated institutions will only follow users within the bounds of the law. They won't have a choice either. The way that the vast majority of people interface with ETH is through centralized exchanges and when those ramps don't support your community fork, your community fork basically doesn't exist to most of the world.\n\nLike you understand that right now, the institutions behind USDT and USDC already effectively have veto power over changes to the protocol, right? If they declare that they don't support a fork and won't honor the redemption of tokens on that fork, it would lead to mass DeFi liquidations when the value of those positions go to zero. So many people will be affected by that collapse that realistically, support for those changes would dry up instantaneously anyway. They (and the govt by proxy) basically already have the power to hold the chain hostage and PoS is just going to give them even power to proactively shape it.\n\nAnd when you consider that pretty much the only things ETH is useful for right now is either skirting regulations (DeFi), money laundering (NFTs), creating even more shitcoins (every ERC-20), stablecoins (fake banks) and getting scammed/hacked - you're crazy to think the govt isn't going to flex that power. Virtually everything that goes on with ETH is antagonistic to govt. The sanctions on russia and the way they're trying to use crypto to dodge them only gives them even more cause. It's already a dicey situation with PoW, and PoS just makes it even more tenuous. It just boggles my mind that no one else seems to see the cliff you're about to walk right off of. You're completely drunk on hopium or just plain oblivious to reality if you can't connect the dots and see what's coming here.",

Miners leave entirely and the hash rate reaches zero meaning no blocks are created.\n\nIn this exponentially unlikely scenario, because blocks aren't created, transactions will not be process regardless of what users would like to do. This would mean everything basically freezes except for information store on centralized databases such as Coinbase. So if you have an NFT on your wallet and wanted to sell it for nothing, you wouldn't be able to because you wouldn't be able to confirm the transaction to sell it. \n\nUltimately, a completely death of Ethereum is very, very unlikely and would be more plausible that it is the death of cryptocurrency entirely due to over-regulation, and even then... Still very unlikely.",

Why is this something you are worried about?\n\nEthereum gas fees are a function of what people are willing to pay and the demand on the system. The higher the fees, the more demand there is. So if Ethereum maintains higher gas fees it is because many individuals really, really want to use the system and are willing to pay whatever the fees are at that time.  With that, sounds like your concern doesn't make any sense.\n\nYou could make the claim that some people are being priced out of the system, which is a known issue and why there is so much work on fixing the gas fees in the future, but this is going to be a multi-year endeavor before Ethereum is finally 'complete'.\n\nThe likelihood of Ethereum failing in that timeframe given the fact that the system is in the process of one of the most important milestones in cryptocurrency history, only behind the creation of Bitcoin and Ethereum, being the transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake would only show a strength in the ecosystem.",

The dollar value of the accrued interest does of course fluctuate, but the ETH value does not. The APR lowers because the APR from the actual Ethereum protocol lowers when more people stake.",

As u/belsaurn said, Newton is great as well, though its spreads tend to be slightly higher than the others (not a big deal if you're trading less than $1,000). The downside to CoinSmart & Bitbuy is that they charge deposit/withdrawal fees on some payment methods, so be aware of that. Newton does not charge deposit or withdrawal fees on e-transfers.\n\nTL;DR There's no perfect exchange, but I do suggest staying away from Shakepay, since you have several better options in Canada.",

When takers fill an order, it can shift the market price by emptying a bit one side or the other of the market orders. \n\nRegarding the ecosystem of all exchanges, the fluctuation of market price is handled by some participants, who recognize discrepancies between the market prices of different exchanges and handle it, while weighing in transaction costs.

            "selftext": "  \n\nI would like to program a coin voting / DAO governance structure entirely on chain, but I am running into some issues and need advice. It would be on something like gnosis/polygon so gas shouldn\u2019t be an issue.   \n \n\nGovernance can be split into 2 main functions \u2013 1) Send a certain amount of tokens from the treasury to any address. 2) Call a function (ie, setParameters()) on one of our contracts. There should be some delay after a vote passes before either one happens. That\u2019s all easy enough. Where I run into the issue is how to conduct coin voting in a decentralized manner on chain. Here are three possibilities and the drawbacks of each.   \n \n\n**1) Past Snapshot Voting** \u2013 Each token holder votes based on their balance at a certain block. Someone uploads a merkle root of the balances and then the contract checks when each vote is cast. The issue of course here is either a) The person uploading the merkle root has to be permissioned or b) anyone can upload the root, but there has to be some way to dispute it. AFAIK, there is no way for someone to prove a merkle root wrong in solidity since it does not have access to previous history.   \n \n\n**2) Add Votes Continuously** \u2013 Each user votes and the contract records them as having voted Y/N, how many votes they cast, and adds those votes to the total. We then release an opensource program that any user can run which can scan through all the votes and current token balances, and can notify the contract if there are any discrepancies. The contract checks the current balance and updates the running total.   \n \n\n**3) Voting preference only** \u2013 Users record their vote and preference, but not their number of votes. When the vote closes, the contract goes through, reads the current balance, and then adds them up. The issue here of course is that we may run out of gas in the block, so we may have to split them into batches of say, 100 votes. Then, someone needs to send a tx for every batch in order to finalize the election.   \n \n\n**4) Auto-update of votes in transfer function** \u2013 We could put some logic in the ERC721 transfer function to automatically update votes \u2013 but this would add some complexity/cost and also I think limit us to one concurrent proposal.   \n \n\nOf course, 2 and 3 seem vulnerable to a flashbots bundle like   \n \n\n1. Flash loan 1M  \n 2. Buy Tokens  \n 3. Record batch / update vote  \n 4. Sell tokens  \n 5. Repay loan.   \n \n\n3 might avoid this issue if we could guarantee to take up all the gas (or close) in a block, but that would require all batches being full I think.   \n \n\nPerhaps a multisig with the only purpose of uploading a merkle proof at a snapshot might be good. Still, I would rather make it completely decentralized if possible.    \n \n\nAny advice, or better yet existing code, would be highly appreciated.",

And that function can only be called after a given block number, to allow for people enough time to vote.",

In Bitcoin, building such systemically risky applications is hard, in large part because Bitcoin lacks rich statefulness and focuses on the simple (and MEV-free) use case of *just being money*.\n\nI don't understand the sentence in bold.\n\n**Can someone explain me exactly what Vitalik is referring to?**\n\nI feel like it is a way to develop a kind of \"useless\" logic that the builder could exploit to earn more money. But don't really get the point, neither the link with risk of centralization.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for your help!",

But there's also a simpler hypothesis:\u00a0Vitalik is a hippy-happy globetrotting pleasure and status-seeker, and he deeply enjoys meeting and feeling respected by people who are important. And it's not just Vitalik; companies like Consensys are totally happy to\u00a0partner with Saudi Arabia, and the ecosystem as a whole keeps trying to look to mainstream figures for validation.\n\nNow ask yourself the question: when the time comes,\u00a0actually important\u00a0things are happening on the blockchain -\u00a0actually important things that offend people who are powerful\u00a0- which ecosystem would be more willing to put its foot down and refuse to censor them no matter how much pressure is applied on them to do so? The ecosystem with globe-trotting nomads who really really care about being everyone's friend, or the ecosystem with people who take pictures of themslves with an AR15 and an axe as a side hobby?\n\n-----\u2010------------------\n\nEspecially this sentence: \"Now ask yourself the question: when the time comes,\u00a0actually important\u00a0things are happening on the blockchain -\u00a0actually important things that offend people who are powerful\u00a0- which ecosystem would be more willing to put its foot down and refuse to censor them no matter how much pressure is applied on them to do so?\"\n\nHe said that important things may happen on the Blockchain and offend powerful people (so people with a \"centralized\" power, which is contrary to blockchain philosophy). The question that comes makes me think that only the ecosystem (blockchain + its community) who will refuse to censor these powerful people is really valuable.\nThat's difficult to understand to me because, of course, a Blockchain that is able to censor someone is contrary to blockchain philosophy. But at the same time, Blockchain should fight power centralization (and then people who centralized a lot of power).\n\nI hope it's clear.\n\nThanks a lot for your help!",

This token would replicate everything about Bitcoin that Bitcoin enthusiasts laud it for but its transactions would be handled natively by the Ethereum chain.\n\nThis token itself would not need to have any frills. You could even skip the issuance rigamarole and have it produce no additional coins after initialization at all, giving it even fewer frills than Bitcoin itself has. Maybe adjust all the balances on initialization upward proportionately to get exactly 21 million if that magic number is desired.\n\nThe fact that this has never been done - or rather, since I'm sure it's been tried numerous times, that the various attempts have all disappeared without a trace - suggests to me that the *feature set* of Bitcoin is not actually in much demand. It's just the *brand* that gives Bitcoin value. This doesn't strike me as being stable in the long term.",

A proof of work component could be placed on top of that, but I can't see how the token could be completely divorced from the underlying protocol.  \n\nTo borrow the argument from the other person in this thread regarding the potential for slashing validators from a particular country based on governmental sanctions... we could also argue that if a sufficient majority of validators decided they were strongly opposed to this particular token and would slash any validators supporting its transactions.  \n\n\nHave any of these things happened? No.  Do I think these kinds of things will happen? No (if I did, I wouldn't have invested heavily in eth).  However... I do believe that it is possible for these things to happen, and some non-zero amount more likely in the ethereum network than the bitcoin network.\n\n\nThe token may also be subject to attack vectors that are less present in the bitcoin network... on btc there's no such thing as a malicious contract that steals my coins, no malicious dapps, no nft mint that's going to spike gas fees absurdly high when I try to transfer.\n\nThis discussion is all making me sound like a BTC maxis:) which... I'm not, I'm generally convinced on the strong security you can achieve through POS, that you can do sharing and be secure, etc.  There are no current changes or near term expected changes to eth that concern me.... but I expect there will be a higher velocity of ongoing changes that I don't know what they will be, and as such I cannot say that there aren't changes coming that will concern me.",

The proof-of-work component would be there solely to allow for new tokens to be distributed in a Bitcoin-like manner.\n\n> To borrow the argument from the other person in this thread regarding the potential for slashing validators from a particular country based on governmental sanctions... we could also argue that if a sufficient majority of validators decided they were strongly opposed to this particular token and would slash any validators supporting its transactions. \n\nThese sorts of things are *theoretically* possible, sure. But Bitcoin is no less vulnerable to these sorts of theoretically-possible attacks either. If a sufficient majority of Bitcoin's users wanted to, they could fork to a version of Bitcoin that deletes a particular addresses' Bitcoins. Or that raises the issuance to 42 million, or that adds trillions of Bitcoins to a particular account, whatever. Hard forks don't just allow the rules to be broken, they allow the rules to be rewritten arbitrarily.\n\nSo we come to the question of *how likely* such a thing might be. And I think having lots of different tokens and smart contracts and so forth running on Ethereum together tilts the balance quite strongly in its favour. If there's a hard fork of Ethereum that nukes this BTC-like token in some way the hard fork will only come into effect if the vast majority of the Ethereum ecosystem agrees to go along with it. But the vast majority likely doesn't have any involvement with this token. The TheDAO hard fork happened back at a time when Ethereum's ecosystem was miniscule and TheDAO was basically the only thing there was for people to be \"investing\" in, so when TheDAO was hacked pretty much every big player in the Ethereum ecosystem had a dog in the fight. And even then the chain split roughly 80/20 in terms of market cap and the remaining 20% carried on as Ethereum Classic, an option that would exist for the hypothetical Bitcoin token.\n\nNow, the vast majority of the Ethereum ecosystem would go \"BTC who?\" And shrug. It has nothing to do with them, so they'd default to not wanting to rock the boat. We've seen this with the Parity multisig wallet attack, for example, where a group of developers who were one of the leading node maintainers got screwed out of value roughly equivalent to what was at stake in TheDAO because the rest of the ecosystem didn't care. They tried pushing hard forks to get their money back and were shouted down so hard they quit developing for Ethereum altogether. Or the Ronin bridge hack, where $600 million worth of tokens were stolen and I haven't even seen a proposal for a hard fork to get it back.\n\n> The token may also be subject to attack vectors that are less present in the bitcoin network... on btc there's no such thing as a malicious contract that steals my coins, no malicious dapps, \n\nSure, but a BTC-on-Ethereum user always has the option of simply *never engaging* with those \"risky\" contracts or dapps. They can treat BTC-on-Ethereum in exactly the same manner as BTC-on-BTC if they prefer. The difference is that on BTC there's not even the option.\n\n> no nft mint that's going to spike gas fees absurdly high when I try to transfer.\n\nYeah, that sharing the underlying blockchain thing does have this one downside. But layer 2 rollups ameliorate this significantly, since rollups can process their transactions off-chain to their hearts' content. You could have the BTC-on-Ethereum token live natively on its own rollup, you could even write the rollup to only update L1 once every ten minutes to get the full Bitcoin experience.\n\n> This discussion is all making me sound like a BTC maxis:)\n\nAnd I should note, when I say \"the only unique value proposition of Bitcoin is its brand\" that actually *is* a value proposition. The \"soft\" side of economics is often just as important as the hard numbers.\n\nIt's just not particularly important *to me*. :)\n\n> I expect there will be a higher velocity of ongoing changes that I don't know what they will be, and as such I cannot say that there aren't changes coming that will concern me.\n\nAnd that's fair. The main reassurance I can offer is that there's half a trillion dollars riding on those future changes not screwing up Ethereum. I tend to trust people who have their entire fortune riding on whether they're trustworthy. :)\n\nFor a BTC-like token that only wants to be BTC-like and doesn't see value in interacting with the wider Ethereum ecosystem, the prospect of an ETC-like chain split would be an additional reassurance. If the whole rest of Ethereum's community decided to go along with a hard fork that deleted the BTC-like token, the users who were using it could reject that hard fork and carry on using it without the rest of the ecosystem's involvement. I think it's unlikely since the benefits of interacting with the rest of Ethereum's ecosystem will be a hard to resist siren call for most, but for the hard-core fundamentalists they could carry on without hindrance.",

These are all 100% made up numbers, but hopefully it will help illustrate why it isn't an issue.\n\nThis would happen because as the supply drops over time due to deflation, the value of 1 ETH rises. People still tie the costs to the dollar, so imagine a scenario with 100M circulating ETH, a price per coin of $1000 and the net amount burned in a year of 1M (with 0.5M created and 1.5M burned)\n\nLet's assume market cap stays constant throughout for ease of calculations, but everything still works with the market cap moving up and down as long as it doesnt go down to 0\n\nThe amount burned works out to be 1% of the supply and now 99M Eth are in existence. Since the market cap is the same at 100b, now the price per coin is $1,010. Now the same dollars in fees are paid, $1.5b which is now 1.48M eth burned instead of the 1.5M. and the created amount remains 0.5M because the created coins aren't tied to the dollar, they are tied to the code the amount is essentially constant. (Net reduction of 998k instead of 1M)\n\nThe number of ETH burned will continue to be higher than the amount created, but decreasing up until it aligns with the amount created. Essentially ETH will be deflationary, but decreasingly so every year as supply gets burned until the supply eventually becomes stable.\n\nKeep in mind, this is SLOW. In the scenario above, we start out at 1% deflation, we don't drop down to 0.5% deflation until 92 years later and the price roughly doubled and the circulating supply is 50M (half the original). To reach 0.1% deflation takes an additional 127 years, and to finally reach equilibrium (within a rounding error since we technically just get exponentially close to 0), it takes 425 years at which point there is a price of around 3x and a circulating supply of 33M",

Demand goes up, so does the price. \n\nThat's the same as gold, its scarce so everyone knows its value won't change from one day to another because someone will find a few tons of it while hiking. \n\nIf your asset is inflationary, people needing the asset to use it would need more and more of it today to do the same thing that they did with it yesterday. This also drives demand for that asset but its not finite and value decreases so slowly people will not want it anymore. \n\nThen comes another aspect of what's coming for Ethereum that I can't explain as well as the article that was posted a few days ago:\n>https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-first-profitable-blockchain?s=r\n\nAll of the Blockchains today are unprofitable. Sure, it's not like they are a company, but the same principles can be applied.\n\nThe product they sell is secured blocks of information and decentralised storage and distribution of this information. \nToday, they get less payment from processing blocks than they need to pay miners/stakers to secure one.

Current network usage is not enough to burn this 4.3% and result in regular deflation (although there were periods in the last year where the network was getting slammed and we did see temporary deflation).\n\nThe merge will drop issuance to 0.43%, since the security from paying validators in PoS is far more capital efficient than paying miners in PoW. At 0.43% issuance, nearly every single day since EIP1559 would have been net deflationary, i.e., more ETH burned than this 0.43% issuance. You can simulate the merge using [ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money) and see that we would be 1% deflationary right now if the merge went live.\n\nHopefully that clears things up for you.",

It bothers me that hosting this dapp is centralized. It only looks at the Ethereum blockchain to make sure an address meets the requirements for the whitelisting. I wish this dapp could be serverless because as long as a server provides the Nuxt functionality this dapp is completely centralized.\n\nSo it occurred to me that when I write a smart contract, I actually write callable functions that can be accessed with the dapp user's Eth wallet. Annnnnnnnnd what is a Nuxt app other than a series of functions that load view pages.... So could I write the entire Nuxt server as a Solidity smart contract? Has anyone done this?\n\nIf the gas cost would make this prohibitive on Ethereum, could you do it on Polygon, or Avalanche, or some other EVM compatible chain?",

What could be more common is to add fields (e.g. service endpoints) to your DID Document.  \n\n\nBut yeah, basically the DID Resolver checks that your ethereum account is still the owner of the did associated with that account, so you can make sure any VCs issued by that DID are valid. The DID resolver is also required if you want to find a service endpoint for a DID (you might check if a DID has a DIDComm endpoint sent so you can send them a message).",

To transfer to Nexo you will need to use the standard Ethereum main network, which they call the \"ERC20 network' on Binance (unless they changed the wording).\n\nBe careful, if you send the funds via any other network the are very likely lost forever!",

Validators are expected to make about 5%+MEV, stakers adding their funds to that validator less so. It's not the same as being able to spend 500 bucks on a simple computer and setting up a miner, which if you joined any time before 2021 that was entirely possible and would have been a lucrative investment. Might even prove to be profitable for people getting in now, we can't know. \n\nAlso this slashing business is bound to lose at least some unlucky people their entire eth savings just for picking one validator over another in the node list. Imagine waking up and seeing your 30 ETH is gone because autofarm had a processing error or some other such nonsense. So close to starting your own node but oh well sorry all sales are final.\n\nAlso, without EIP-1559, which didn't actually reduce any fees, it just started burning some of the miners income, there would be VERY few people even caring about the electricity cost in comparison to the profitability. It's like a 30% difference since 1559. If everyone was making $15/day for every $10 the profitability would still be worth more than electricity. But, with ETHs move to PoS it inclines me to believe they are influenced by some large investors in connection with the ESG and WEF directive, so artificially nerfing profitability doesn't seem out of the question. Just so everyone knows they want to limit the regular citizens access to energy and even the choices they have in how to use that energy. They've been doing it since the days of Tesla, gatekeeping the greatest technological advancement in the history of mankind.",

By that I mean, the cost per unit of running 50 ASICS is significantly higher than the cost per unit of running 5,000 ASICs. Because once you get large enough you have a dedicated facility, specialized staff, and a power contract with the grid. It gets cheaper with scale. For validators, the cost of running one validator is already  small so the benefit of scale is much smaller too.",

SOL NFTs certainly have a lower price of entry and the selling point is certainly the low gas fees. So ETH's future can definitely compete  on that front, but I can't see either disappearing.\n\n  \nIf you want a super secure place to store ETH and SOL NFTs in the same place, I highly recommend the project I've been working on, Gridlock. We're a mobile crypto wallet that uses key-splitting and threshold signatures to ensure your wallet is un-breachable without the need for seed phrases or other dated or centralized recovery options.\n\nEverything comes down to your Guardians, people who you trust and assign to hold a piece of your private key. When you want to make a transaction, we reassemble your key to give you access and you even use them to help you re-gain access if you forget your password or lose your phone! We're all about security and we are on the verge of getting out there to the wider crypto world, it's only a matter of time before people see how bulletproof our security is.\n\nWe currently support ETH and SOL as well as NFTs on these blockchains, so you can store both in one place securely and with ease! Check it out and let me know what you think",

                    "response": "In general economy, staking is the process of putting an asset in risk of being lost in exchange for a leverage. This leverage generally allows people to trust you and trade with you. \n\nYou have this with some banks who allow you privileged bank accounts if you hold more than X in fiat in there at all times and things like that. \n\nIn blockchain consensus, staking is used as a proof you're giving leverage to others on your asset. You stake that asset, so that you can be easily trusted in a trustless and permissionless environment. \n\nThat stake then allows you to have a right to work for a blockchain and prove you won't misbehave in such work, because you will otherwise lose your stake and people expect that you don't want that. That work you're doing for that blockchain involves choosing what new block will be added to the chain. In exchange for that work, of course, you're paid a reward. \n\nThis allows people to stake in exchange for a reward because they can work for it or to stake and let others work in exchange for a part of the reward. \n\nCuriously, we can observe the classic employee-employer relationship has been shifted in this model, since big pools are the workers and people staking money are the employers, here.\n\nThis, combined with the practicality of being able to easily switch from one pool to another and with the ability to stake and work on your own ensures big pools can't shift the profit distribution towards themselves, as opposed to the classic work environment we're seeing today.",

Neither network has implemented any kind of base-layer scaling, so fees are entirely dependent upon user demand. \n\nETH has high demand and valuable blockspace, therefore high fees. \n\nBTC has almost nonexistent demand and very cheap blockspace, therefore low fees. \n\nThe kicker is that BTC is increasingly dependent upon network fees for security due to the halvings, yet fees have had a downward trajectory over the last year or two. ETH isn't dependent on fees for security, yet has consistently had fees high enough to be deflationary post-PoS merge. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1511470668457652224",

If you don't see high fees on BTC mainnet it means that the block subsidy is providing the majority of security and the overall security budget is effectively halved ever 4 years. \n\nHigh fees on ETH aren't good for mass-adoption, but ultimately ETH mainnet is no longer intended for everyday use but rather as a settlement layer for rollups. The fact that fees are still significant even during a significant market downturn shows a resilient level of demand for ETH blockspace, which is a really good metric. Add in EIP-1559 and high fees actually begin to benefit ETH holders by decreasing net issuance and inflation. Add in the burgeoning L2 ecosystems and high mainnet fees essentially become an afterthought. \n\nSo yes, ETH gets to double-dip on the narratives here while BTC gets dinged instead. ETH gets the best of both worlds with high fees burning more ETH while rollups keep fees low for mass adoption, while BTC is struggling to find a viable long-term security plan.",

This is value that comes from everybody simply *wanting* it because everyone else wants it. This is a source of value that's quite possible to crash to zero, and a ripe foundation for building a ponzi scheme on.\n\nTo try to determine if a cryptocurrency has value beyond simple speculation, look at a cryptocurrency and ask \"what is this actually *for*?\" What does holding the token allow you to do that you couldn't otherwise do?\n\nYou must have Ether to pay the transaction fee for transactions on Ethereum. This is built into the Ethereum protocol ever since EIP-1559 was implemented, there's no other way to make a transaction happen. So if you want to use any of the dapps that are built on Ethereum you must buy some Ether to pay for that. That's a foundational source of value that will keep Ether from crashing all the way to zero.\n\nImportant note: Ether still has a speculative component to its price. Probably quite a large speculative component. So even though it's very hard for Ether to crash literally to zero, it can still fall. Probably quite far. Never invest more than you're willing to lose. If you're investing vital savings that will leave you destitute or without a retirement to fall back on, go the traditional boring route of mutual funds and whatnot. Ether has a stronger foundation than Luna, but this is all still new technology and there's no way to guarantee safety nets.",

I cannot believe I agreed to this scam.\n\nI really wish I could withdraw my Eth from Coinbase but, like a complete moron, I agreed to the terms & conditions of staking Eth, so it just sits there, locked away and completely inaccessible while the Ethereum developers do exactly what, I have no idea. It's been one year. Nothing. No movement. No progress. Just a bunch of b.s. nonsense. What a goddamn scam this is.",
