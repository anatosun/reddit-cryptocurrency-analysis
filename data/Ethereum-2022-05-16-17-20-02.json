How could I do this with mininal fee incurred?\n\nAre L2 solutions any good for this usecase? Bridging is not cheap so I don't think L2 solutions would be any help for transfer of eth.

Should go through eventually and cost like $1 per wallet. \n\nYou can send stuff either to one of your wallets or to a CEX supporting withdrawals via Arbitrum. Then you could move things to a rollup cheaply.",
