I just hope that eventually they start becoming more of a standard.\n\nUBC has a 'Blockchain@UBC' microcertificate program that is leading students to internships in the industry.\n\nMIT Sloan also had an entire course on Blockchain technology which was taught by Gary Gensler. It's available on YouTube for free at MIT Open Courseware's channel.\n\nThere are crypto projects like BitDAO pushing this agenda as through funding autonomous entities like EduDAO which will help students start working and building in the Web3 and DeFi space.\n\nIf we keep up this pace then we might start witnessing the rise of some crypto-centric and specific colleges and universities which will definitely give crypto mainstream adoption a HUGE boost in my opinion.\n\nDid anyone here ever study a crypto or blockchain related course in their university? Would be interesting to know more about it to be honest.",

At the moment there are few valid cases for blockchains and I see no reason why there would be universities somehow focusing on cryptos anymore than they are focusing on JavaScript or HTML.\n\nTons of universities already touch upon blockchains, smart contracts etc. and I don't expect this to get any more attention and this is from someone working in the industry.",

CS departments are going to change that slowly. This and Data Science are the two big applied areas that traditional CS graduates are not very well equipped for without some applied courses in the discipline. It is starting to change curriculums. \n\nDoesn't mean it's a blockchain degree, but a CS degree with a minor in fintech/blockchain/data science has value on the job market.",
