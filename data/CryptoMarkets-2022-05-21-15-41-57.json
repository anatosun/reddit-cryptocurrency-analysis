But doing so while insisting that Fiat is evil or worthless and you hate it is just silly.",

If Elon Musk sold his entire TSLA portfolio and bought BTC with the intention of tanking it later he couldn't even buy 10% of the current supply. If the largest active BTC wallet today drained their entire supply in 5 minutes prices would rebound in an hour. It's well past the point where someone could short ladder attack it, so that point is also moot and based on ignorance of the market.",

Also banks are legally allowed to spend \"some\" of your cash as long as they hold enough. Which makes it a legal Ponzi scheme. If you Google how much they need to hold in cash compared to customers deposits. You may be shocked. And probably a little worried if you have large amounts saved in a bank. I don't care that you don't care about bitcoin and you don't like it. I really couldn't give a shit but honestly look at the history of fiat.

Fiat currency is the key to accessing business inventory and services. It's their coin if you will, isn't it dumb that each store can have its own currency? Whoops only brought target dollars I sure hope Walmart offers fair value trade for them....wait a minute...that's what fiat currency already protects us from. Real issue is all monetary systems built on a trading mechanism will be abused by those who don't give a fuck about regular people rules. Crypto didn't fix anything, it just temporarily shifted money into our normie hands. Then ripped it all back , or does someone want to tell me how they  have moonshot returns. If BTC can't exist alongside fiat, well the RIP BTC",

People didnt like the leader for obvious reasons, how could it ever come back, especially if he is around.  \n\n\nLuna can have memeworth at best, but most likely not more and will just fade away.",
