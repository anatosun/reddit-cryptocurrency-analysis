If mass adoption happens Bitcoin ought to absorb at least a considerable chunk of these transactions. In many cases lightning will be the solution but the main chain will still be used as well, for big transactions, most likely by big corporations/institutions where a fee of $200(0) doesn't seem big at all.\n\nThere are also other problems if switching around requires an intersection with the first layer, but this one is the easiest to explain.",
