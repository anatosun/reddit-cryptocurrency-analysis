If mass adoption happens Bitcoin ought to absorb at least a considerable chunk of these transactions. In many cases lightning will be the solution but the main chain will still be used as well, for big transactions, most likely by big corporations/institutions where a fee of $200(0) doesn't seem big at all.\n\nThere are also other problems if switching around requires an intersection with the first layer, but this one is the easiest to explain.",

The cost to onboard means that large entities (banks and large corporations) will have incentive to provide custodial wallets and people will choose that over the hassle and expense of using their own wallets.\n\nImagine the scenario where you try to buy something from Walmart (for example) when you don't yet have a wallet. You can download a wallet to your phone, being unsure if it is safe and costing you around $5 just to create your account, or you can use the WalmartWallet for free. You know the WalmartWallet will work just fine with Walmart and likely anyone else and you can trust that if anything goes wrong you can at least eventually get some help.\n\nThis sort of thing will be compounded by eventual transaction fees (small as they may be) for routing, and highly connected nodes will tend to get preferred. Think about what sort of entities will already have a ton of monetary connection - banks, large corporations, etc.\n\nThose of us who understand why cryptocurrency was invented will prefer a little cost and hassle to get freedom, but the masses don't know and don't care. They'll just go with whatever is easy, and the banksters will offer that. And that is my thesis as to why LN is centralizing.",
