                    "response": "Yes, eventually. \n\nThis is a very big topic, but it ultimately benefits the Fed to have an item on its balance sheet that (a) is non debt based (ie. pure asset), and (b) inflates freely and perpetually against the dollar. \n\nInterestingly Gold was originally going to be that, but that plan was cut short when Congress mandated that the Fed permanently value its gold holdings at $42/oz.\n\nThis move by congress was a \"heart is in the right place, but ultimately self-destructive\". Congress thought such a move would put the brakes on the Feds ability to print, however it hasn't worked out like that in real life. \n\nThe result has been a debt-liquidity trap which is actually far more insidious and far more difficult to extricate from. Now the fed is trapped in a cycle, where every dollar it creates also increases the amount of debt in the system. The result is perpetual blackhole - a massive unsolvable debt - that threatens to suck the entire financial system into it. \n\nHaving the ability to hold something on its balance sheet that goes against currency issuance AND is not debt-based offers the Fed a way out. As I said, this was supposed to be the role of Gold, but Congress's lack of foresight diminished its role to act as that counter-balance.",
