I assume that the liquidation in the case of undercollateralization depends on the price of RBTC, not BTC. Hence, if the price oracle is flawed, non-functioning or compromised, your position is at risk of being liquidated.\n\nSecondly, there is the problem of flash crashes. Those can be caused by price oracle, in many cases these are symptoms of something else though e.g. bad liquidity, market manipulation etc. Flash crashes may instantly liquidate any position, even one with a TVL of only 10%. And then the question is why even bother for 10%?\n\nThe third problem is that bitcoin is too volatile in its current state on its own. Once bitcoin is less volatile, this makes more sense. A rational LTV in these environments would be 50%. Then, however, if you did 50% TVL above $60k you would be screwed right now and required to put in more collateral. So what else do you want to do? 40% TVL? 30%? At some point, you put your bitcoin at risk for 30% of their current value which is very concerning from a portfolio-management perspective.\n\nThe only real scenario such a loan can make sense is if you are desperate for the money. But then what do you do? How sure are you you can pay it back? Because again, going 90% TVL makes no sense, you will be instantly liquidated on one bad day. Going 50% TVL makes more sense but then you basically loan out your coins for 50% of their current value and hope you can in the future repay your debt, otherwise you basically sold for a 50% loss right away.\n\nIn any case I think this is a very tricky deal that people dont fully understand, hence shouldnt take. There should not be a situation that requires to loan out bitcoin for money, because then you invested money you couldnt afford to invest. From an investment perspective its also highly questionable due to risk I mentioned above. So what's the usecase actually?",
