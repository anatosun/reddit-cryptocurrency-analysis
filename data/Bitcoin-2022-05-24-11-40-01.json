The discount also represents probability that it will never be approved, probability that the price of Bitcoin will drop before it's approved, probability that Grayscale is not holding as much as they claim or they go bankrupt (or something less extreme) before converting, etc.  \n\nOverall, though, I agree with you that the current discount to NAV is much steeper than is reasonable and that it's a great buying opportunity (especially if you're interested in long-term investment & especially if you're accessing it via tax advantaged account where you can't buy Bitcoin directly).",
