WesternUnion costs $3 and takes a day to transfer.\n\nI realized Dogecoin would be much cheaper and faster to send. \n\nI was thinking maybe I could send the monks a Dogecoin prepaid card. \n\nIt would be really convenient if I can add Dogecoin to the card and the monks could take it to an ATM and pull out the money.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions?",

I know visa have started a dogecoin card but I don't really know to what extent.\n\nHope some of these help",
