            "selftext": "After Terra depegging, everything was demolished in De-Fi, but the place that got affected the most is El Salvador, without any doubt. \n\nEl Salvador is a Central American state that recently became the world's first region to regulate BTC cryptocurrency as legal tender, nearly allowing it to replace traditional currency in its economy by planning to issue tokens for sovereign bonds. \n \nAs per Mint\n( https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-sees-flash-crash-on-the-day-el-salvador-adopts-it-as-legal-tender-11631032181072.html )\n\nEl Salvador injected significant liquidity of its holdings in BTC while it was down. The purpose behind it was to attract FDI, reduce economic dependence on the US dollar, etc. However, it backfired after bitcoin crashed to 40% of its all-time high, and it declined more after Terra depegging. \n\nThe state's debts have increased, the economy is in a negative trend, and it is near to a crisis and whatnot. Exiting now and selling all BTC could be a table-turning move as the state will nearly lose half of its liquidity. Yet, the suitable option for El Salvador seems to be to hold on till the market recovers. \n\nIt is the best option since new protocols might help De-Fi and BTC recover better; Tea, for example. It is a protocol that allows users to develop open-source projects alongside providing remunerations, hence paving the way for projects which have the potential to clinch success.",
