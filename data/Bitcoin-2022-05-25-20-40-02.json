I have also invested in other exchanges, which has only increased my number of transactions. With that being said, when you have so many transactions, it takes way too much time to do everything manually. I used to use a good old fashioned excel sheet, but it would take me days to finish everything. I have also sought out advice from my accountant, but they aren't the most experienced with crypto. I've heard of crypto tax software and was wondering, is it worth it? And is it also safe? Any advice would be much appreciated.",

I have been using a crypto tax software and it has been a life saver for me, my favourite being Koinly. They are super safe, works with a large variety of exchanges, has great blogs that break everything down, is pretty accurate, and also has a great support team. All you have to do is follow their guides on how to import your data from the exchange, and it will do the rest of the work for you. Since you mentioned you invested in bitcoin, here is a blog on how to import transactions for that exchange specifically: https://koinly.io/integrations/btc/",

Don't rely on your accountant just yet (maybe in a couple years) unless they know what they are doing.  Many do not, or they do but they don't know about crypto tax software, and do not have the programming skill to automate the FIFO matching for thousands of trades (they are used to doing things by hand).\n\n(2) **Use** ***my*** **software** :) - I open-sourced a bog-simple Python script to do this for everyone.  If Code is not at all \"pythonic\" (this is me learning Python by porting the app from perl), but it works.  You copy/paste your transactions in a particular format, and copy/paste historical price data from a source (I include a ton of them already, but some most coins/many dates are of course missing).  Instructions read like a book, you can't get lost.\n\n[https://github.com/technobunny/crypto-tax](https://github.com/technobunny/crypto-tax)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan't help on the mining transactions per se.  I would imagine (ask your accountant) these are simply \"buy\" transactions with price $0 for FIFO purposes, so shuffle them into the transaction list that way and the script above \"just works\".  Since you use elec. and HW for mining, perhaps you get other tax writeoffs in another form.  Or maybe mining income is separate and not even on cap gains form.  Please check on that.",
