Anyways, looks like they are now going to make reward periods that expire, so if you don't select a new reward after a month or so then you won't receive rewards.  Maybe this helps with fraud prevention or maybe this is more to help them avoid paying out rewards to the people who don't pay attention or forget.\n\nEdit: I forgot my initial point.  I was basically saying, if you haven't already, login to your coinbase account and see if you need to select the reward again.",

It was initially verified and after 5 years in 2022 I've received a new request to verify my account again. I have immediately provided all necessary information and in 1 day was informed that the verification was finished and I may continue trading.\n\nAfter 3 weeks I have logged in to Coinbase (not Coinbase Pro) to try some new features and transferred some money there from my Coinbase Pro account. On the same day few hours later I have received a new e-mail from Coinbase that My Photo ID is being verified and immediately came another e-mail with Notice about the Account Closure.\n\nI was surprised to see that and have opened on the same day a support ticket to get more infos, but didn't get any response. Next day I decided to call the Coinbase Support and they said that my case will be escalated, but after the next 2 days I didn't hear from them. I called them once again and reminded about my case and what they said was that the reason for a new review of my account and closure are connected with russian sanctions, but the thing is that I am not even a russian resident nor a russian citizen and have already confirmed my non-russian residence while verification 3 weeks ago. So how this could be a reason for closure, I can't get to the point.\n\nCoinbase doesn't allow me to transfer the remaining assets right now and I cannot manage them. They say that I need to wait for solution and afterwards it will be possible to transfer my assets but they don't give any estimation on how long it will take. So I am still not able to use my coinbase account and my funds are being blocked.\n\nMaybe one of you had a similar situation and knows how to unlock my account and my savings?\n\nI would be glad if Coinbase Support pays attention on that and will help me to resolve this case.",
