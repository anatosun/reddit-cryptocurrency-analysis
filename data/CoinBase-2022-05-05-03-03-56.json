            "selftext": "I initiated a regular ACH transfer from my bank checking account yesterday. I immediately used the USD funds to make a couple trades. Coinbase soon informed me that the ACH transaction was canceled by my bank, my Coinbase account has been disabled and I needed to repay the USD funds. I immediately called my bank and they informed me they see no record of an ACH request from Coinbase and they did NOT cancel or reject any funds request. Indeed, this is the same bank I have been using for many years to fund Coinbase with no problems. So I immediately clicked \"Resolve\" inside my CB account and initiated a second USD transfer from that same bank. Those funds were successfully approved and ACH transfer started.\n\nLater I received an email from Coinbase admitting the problem was technical difficulties on their end:\n\n>\"We are reaching out to you regarding a recent ACH transaction on your account, where you attempted to buy or deposit funds into your Coinbase account using your bank account.  \n>  \n>On May 3rd, 2022, Coinbase experienced technical difficulties processing transactions from US bank accounts via ACH. As a result, while your Coinbase account was credited and you were able to purchase crypto on our platform, Coinbase did not actually receive any funds from your bank.\u00a0  \n>  \n>When this happens, Coinbase is required to recover the USD value of the original buy/deposit you attempted to make to your account.\u00a0 If your Coinbase account balance was insufficient to enable us to do so, you will not be able to trade, purchase, or withdraw until the resulting negative balance has been resolved.\"\n\nNow even though I already initiated a successful second ACH transfer, Coinbase has still LOCKED my account for any crypto withdrawals or trading. I called customer support and they informed me they understand it was not my fault but their policy requires my account stay locked for 5 business days until the latest ACH transfer to complete.\n\nThis makes no sense, since the error seems to be entirely on Coinbase\u2019s end, but yet my account is frozen and funds held hostage as if I am a criminal!?\n\n======================================\n\nCLOSURE UPDATE ON MAY 5:\n\nLooks like Coinbase came through and expedited a fix, unfreezing many accounts without making us wait 5 days as originally messaged. The problem was initially reported by CB on [https://status.coinbase.com/](https://status.coinbase.com/) page as a glitch with US bank ACH transfers that was resolved within 30 minutes. However, the freezing of affected accounts was not resolved until approximately 48 hours later, at least in my case. THANKS COINBASE for doing the right thing here and expediting the fix! ",

My suspicion is this account freeze was \"intentional\" to prevent losses on their end. I am not a conspiracy theorist, but the timing of this is highly suspect, especially since it has happened to so many customers on May 3.\n\nHere are my written communications with Coinbase Support.\n\n**\\*\\*\\* COINBASE SUPPORT EMAILS,  TIMELINE \\*\\*\\***\n\n**Message #1 - May 3**  (2:00pm)\n\n>***We've cancelled your transaction***.  \n>  \n>On May 3, 2022, you deposited $20,000.00 via your bank account.Unfortunately, this transaction was canceled by your bank\\*.\\* If you wish to make another deposit, please try again or add a new payment method.

As a result, while your Coinbase account was credited and you were able to purchase crypto on our platform, Coinbase did not actually receive any funds from your bank.  \n>  \n>When this happens, Coinbase is required to recover the USD value of the original buy/deposit you attempted to make to your account.
