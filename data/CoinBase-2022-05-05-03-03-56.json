            "selftext": "I initiated a regular ACH transfer from my bank checking account yesterday. I immediately used the USD funds to make a couple trades. Coinbase soon informed me that the ACH transaction was canceled by my bank, my Coinbase account has been disabled and I needed to repay the USD funds. I immediately called my bank and they informed me they see no record of an ACH request from Coinbase and they did NOT cancel or reject any funds request. Indeed, this is the same bank I have been using for many years to fund Coinbase with no problems. So I immediately clicked \"Resolve\" inside my CB account and initiated a second USD transfer from that same bank. Those funds were successfully approved and ACH transfer started.\n\nLater I received an email from Coinbase admitting the problem was technical difficulties on their end:\n\n>\"We are reaching out to you regarding a recent ACH transaction on your account, where you attempted to buy or deposit funds into your Coinbase account using your bank account.  \n>  \n>On May 3rd, 2022, Coinbase experienced technical difficulties processing transactions from US bank accounts via ACH. As a result, while your Coinbase account was credited and you were able to purchase crypto on our platform, Coinbase did not actually receive any funds from your bank.\u00a0  \n>  \n>When this happens, Coinbase is required to recover the USD value of the original buy/deposit you attempted to make to your account.\u00a0 If your Coinbase account balance was insufficient to enable us to do so, you will not be able to trade, purchase, or withdraw until the resulting negative balance has been resolved.\"\n\nNow even though I already initiated a successful second ACH transfer, Coinbase has still LOCKED my account for any crypto withdrawals or trading. I called customer support and they informed me they understand it was not my fault but their policy requires my account stay locked for 5 business days until the latest ACH transfer to complete.\n\nThis makes no sense, since the error seems to be entirely on Coinbase\u2019s end, but yet my account is frozen and funds held hostage as if I am a criminal!?\n\n======================================\n\nCLOSURE UPDATE ON MAY 5:\n\nLooks like Coinbase came through and expedited a fix, unfreezing many accounts without making us wait 5 days as originally messaged. The problem was initially reported by CB on [https://status.coinbase.com/](https://status.coinbase.com/) page as a glitch with US bank ACH transfers that was resolved within 30 minutes. However, the freezing of affected accounts was not resolved until approximately 48 hours later, at least in my case. THANKS COINBASE for doing the right thing here and expediting the fix! ",

After I made a few trades and transferred coins out, they actually took the same amount of money I transferred out of my ETH2 which I\u2019m not even sure if they can do that since ETH2 is supposed to be staked?? Was on the phone with support for an hour and they couldn\u2019t tell me anything. I\u2019ve been using them for awhile and this was my first issue and needing to deal with customer service. I know understand the pain of people that I see posting here. Was a horrible experience and I\u2019m happy I only keep my ETH2 on there. If I could trade I would take that off as well.\n\nEdit: Using Bank Of America but seems like other banks are also \u201ccanceling\u201d transactions",

Coinbase admitted this was due to an ACH error on their end,  but they still placed a 5 Day Restriction on my account which Phone Support said cannot be removed under any circumstances, even though it is Coinbase's admitted error.\n\n>*Thanks for reaching out to us.

Thank you for your continued patience, and sorry for any inconvenience caused.*\n\nAnother interesting fact is I have $30,000 USD cash in my account, plus $10,000 SELL and $17,000 BUY orders that were entered **before my account was frozen** that were not allowed to execute on May 4 during the market pump, which has now cost me $5000 in losses due to the market drop today. My suspicion is this account freeze was \"intentional\" to prevent losses on their end. I am not a conspiracy theorist, but the timing of this is highly suspect, especially since it has happened to so many customers on May 3.\n\nHere are my written communications with Coinbase Support.\n\n**\\*\\*\\* COINBASE SUPPORT EMAILS,  TIMELINE \\*\\*\\***\n\n**Message #1 - May 3**  (2:00pm)\n\n>***We've cancelled your transaction***.  \n>  \n>On May 3, 2022, you deposited $20,000.00 via your bank account.Unfortunately, this transaction was canceled by your bank\\*.\\* If you wish to make another deposit, please try again or add a new payment method.

As a result, while your Coinbase account was credited and you were able to purchase crypto on our platform, Coinbase did not actually receive any funds from your bank.  \n>  \n>When this happens, Coinbase is required to recover the USD value of the original buy/deposit you attempted to make to your account.  If your Coinbase account balance was insufficient to enable us to do so, you will not be able to trade, purchase, or withdraw until the resulting negative balance has been resolved.

At the end of the call he was very apologetic, but stated that there was nothing anyone at Coinbase could do to remove the 5 Day account restriction once it has been applied due to Coinbase \"security\", even though the restriction was added due to Coinbase's error.  \n>  \n>I then requested a Supervisor to review with me but he stated that Supervisors are not available to speak with customers by phone.  He then stated that he would \"escalate\" my case and *Coinbase Pro Support* would be in touch with me via email to provide a more detailed response.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**May 5**\n\n>I emailed Support 3 times requesting information regarding their policy and Terms and Conditions. I received no response.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**May 6  (8:00am)**\n\n>I just logged in and the account restrictions have been fully removed. I received no written notice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are allowed to sue Coinbase via Small Claims Court or Arbitration for any documented losses you have incurred due to their error, but you will need to file a Coinbase Complaint first in order for any legal action to be successful.

But when I called my bank they said they did not (and I've been using this same bank to fund CB for years). Now my CB account is LOCKED for trading and withdrawals. Spent time with customer support yesterday. They know the issue and say it must be locked now until 5 days elapse for a new ACH transfer to complete. This is BS.",
