This huge increase in supply caused Luna\u2019s price to drop.\n* Its peg has been lost and now investors are rushing to dump the LUNA token.\n* As LUNA experiences low prices and high volatility it is likely that exchange spreads will continue to widen, which may ultimately lead to delisting on the part of the exchanges",

Before this incident, there were 10M LUNA, now there are 1BIllion and rising, because they are printing more and more LUNA to try to drive the price of their UST back up to $1. DO Kwon could only save one of his children, and the chosen one is UST. LUNA is being sacrificed. \n\nYou could ask, well, if UST regains the peg, what then? Could LUNA begin its journey to regain its former ATH? No- becuase LUNA used to have a fixed supply that was continually being burned, you'll remember- now it is the diametric opposite position, of huge numbers being printed, not burned. \n\n'Perhaps' it might settle down at SHIB-type levels because it now has  a SHIB-like supply, so 0.00005 would be a reasonable price. The chances of it reganing ATH are slim to zero though, ie as much chance as SHIB going to $120.\n\nFuck.",

Ethereum uses solidity for example, and other platforms use their own.\n\nAs you can see i don't really know much about it but at least I hope I gave you a clue.

A coin is definitely more complicated and it does requires some investment like hardware to keep your network running, plus basic coins have no functionality that may be required for apps deployment, like dogecoin or Litecoin. With a token your only cost is the investment in learning how to use the platform, since the network already exists, plus the network is already adapted to support more features.\n\nThe obvious first choice would be Ethereum, but there are other options maybe with an easier entry level. Binance Smart Chain seems to be very popular for tons of the smaller tokens that come and go so I guess is fairly easy to learn, create and deploy, but the assets on there seems to be more on the side of shitcoins.\n\nOther than that there's tons of networks similar to Ethereum that should be a middle point between the complexity and cost of Ethereum and the basic entry point of BSC, like polkadot, Solana, or polygon network. I'm assuming each one of those has its own entry requisites and particular ways to create and deploy your token and app, so I would suggest you look into each one and what do you feels fits better for you. [Here](https://www.devteam.space/blog/how-to-build-a-decentralized-application-dapps/) is a nice summary of the process for and app and token in the Ethereum network. Look for something similar adapted to other networks.\n\nOther than creating the actual app and token, then you would be looking as promotion and marketing costs and hosting and domain for a website, which are not really too expensive. Probably the more complex would be the marketing and promoting which I really have no idea about it.\n\nAll in all, tokens running in an existing network don't seem to be too expensive to create other than time invested, and mostly costs would be in the awareness campaign to promote your creation.",

Who was able to mint Luna with UST?\n\nLuna community keeps sending me to DEX, but I'm not asking about that, I'm asking about the burn UST mint Luna...\n\nBecause people who could do that, I'm guessing the inner VC circle are directly responsible in the crash.\n\nLet me explain, Let's say Do Kwon is the only one who could mint Luna with UST, if price of Luna is 10$ and Price of UST is 0.5$, you need to pay 20UST on a free market, because free market doesn't care how much UST \"should\" be worth, it's worth 0.5$ end of story.\n\nOn the other side we have the arbitrage, the centralized Luna/UST mint/burn, over there you give 1UST (no matter the price on the market) and you receive 1$ worth of Luna. In this case when UST is worth 0.5$, you basically get 1$ worth of Luna for 0.5$.\n\nThe one who has this power to mint has the perpetual free money machine as long as UST is worth less than 1$.\n\nIf messari circulating chart is correct, the supply increased from 340M to 1,4B coins. So 1B was probably dumped to the market in 1 day.\n\nNow I get this is the pegging mechanism, buy UST (increase price) mint and sell Luna (decrease price).\n\nBut after all someone who was able to mint got very rich in this dump, he doubled his investment with every cycle.\n\nI think since it was a closed centralized minting protocol, the responsible persons could be sued?\n\nAfter all this was a multi billion scam, if they manage to steal only 0.5B or sth. it doesn't matter, they should be held responsible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter all Venture capitalists are in this business to make money, the sooner the better for them, \n\n Luna was fortunate enough to be able to blame it on \"attack\" and failed protocol, if we let them get away with it, others will do the same with a different protocol.\n\nJust my opinion.",
