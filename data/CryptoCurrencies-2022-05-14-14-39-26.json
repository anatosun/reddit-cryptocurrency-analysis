This huge increase in supply caused Luna\u2019s price to drop.\n* Its peg has been lost and now investors are rushing to dump the LUNA token.\n* As LUNA experiences low prices and high volatility it is likely that exchange spreads will continue to widen, which may ultimately lead to delisting on the part of the exchanges",

Who was able to mint Luna with UST?\n\nLuna community keeps sending me to DEX, but I'm not asking about that, I'm asking about the burn UST mint Luna...\n\nBecause people who could do that, I'm guessing the inner VC circle are directly responsible in the crash.\n\nLet me explain, Let's say Do Kwon is the only one who could mint Luna with UST, if price of Luna is 10$ and Price of UST is 0.5$, you need to pay 20UST on a free market, because free market doesn't care how much UST \"should\" be worth, it's worth 0.5$ end of story.\n\nOn the other side we have the arbitrage, the centralized Luna/UST mint/burn, over there you give 1UST (no matter the price on the market) and you receive 1$ worth of Luna. In this case when UST is worth 0.5$, you basically get 1$ worth of Luna for 0.5$.\n\nThe one who has this power to mint has the perpetual free money machine as long as UST is worth less than 1$.\n\nIf messari circulating chart is correct, the supply increased from 340M to 1,4B coins. So 1B was probably dumped to the market in 1 day.\n\nNow I get this is the pegging mechanism, buy UST (increase price) mint and sell Luna (decrease price).\n\nBut after all someone who was able to mint got very rich in this dump, he doubled his investment with every cycle.\n\nI think since it was a closed centralized minting protocol, the responsible persons could be sued?\n\nAfter all this was a multi billion scam, if they manage to steal only 0.5B or sth. it doesn't matter, they should be held responsible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter all Venture capitalists are in this business to make money, the sooner the better for them, \n\n Luna was fortunate enough to be able to blame it on \"attack\" and failed protocol, if we let them get away with it, others will do the same with a different protocol.\n\nJust my opinion.",

DO Kwon could only save one of his children, and the chosen one is UST. LUNA is being sacrificed. \n\nYou could ask, well, if UST regains the peg, what then? Could LUNA begin its journey to regain its former ATH? No- becuase LUNA used to have a fixed supply that was continually being burned, you'll remember- now it is the diametric opposite position, of huge numbers being printed, not burned. \n\n'Perhaps' it might settle down at SHIB-type levels because it now has  a SHIB-like supply, so 0.00005 would be a reasonable price. The chances of it reganing ATH are slim to zero though, ie as much chance as SHIB going to $120.\n\nFuck.",

For best security you need to find out what each cryptocurrency's best wallets are that are designed for them and use them. \n\nFor example, for Nano (XNO) you should use Natrium mobile wallet, or Nault.cc for desktop. These are optimized and built specificaly for best performance for that specific cryptocurrency. You won't have to worry about future wallet failure or whatever in say 10 years. With multi-wallets you run the risk of lost functionality in a year or two. \n\nr/nanocurrency r/nanotrade",
