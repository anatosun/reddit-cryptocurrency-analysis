            "selftext": "Let me tell u the Rolercoaster ride I\u2019ve been on the last few days. \n\nOK, so I met someone on Twitter (I know, red flag lol). We talked for like 6 to 7 days. She asked why in the world I wasn\u2019t part of an eth mining pool. She said she was bringing in 4 eth a day as profit. I asked her how it\u2019s done, apparently, you take tether in your coin base wallet, and you join an Ethereum mining pool, and they use your tether to create eth and you get dividends back in Ethereum. \n\nI tried it with a small amount and saw that it was indeed making profit that I could withdraw in tether and send back to coin base and ultimately my account. The profit was incredible. The return is 1-3% per day depending on the amount of tether you have. \n\nSo I put in $200k of tether and was making 2% per day. That\u2019s $4000 per day in ethereum straight to my account as passive income. I was about to retire. \n\nToday I took a nap, when I got up, I checked my tether account (200,000 tether), and the balance was zero. A random address had withdrawn it all \ud83d\ude23\n\nI contacted the mining pool help and they said it has to be staked/pledged for 30 days. I have no access to it or the profits, but I can see the profits being made (approx 0.5 tether every 6 hours)\u2026staking it doubles the profit. \n\nSo I called coinbase wallet freaking out wondering if this is a scam and they said they\u2019ve never heard of an issue like this before which is a good sign. Also, that girl I met who told me about it, is still talking to me and trying to ease my worries\u2026which is also a good sign because of it was a scam, she would just disappear. \n\nIf it\u2019s a scam, I\u2019m out of 200k. If it\u2019s not a scam. The 200k is set to bring in $270k just in profit in one month.\n\nDo you guys have any experience or thoughts on this?",

The return you were promised is between 365% to >1,000% annually. If that were possible those people would not be convincing strangers on twitter to hand over their money and the wealthy would not be wasting their time with blackrock.\n\nOr another example, they could turn 1k into 1.4mm in 2 years.

Only scammers using coinbase name.  \nI got into this on 11 October 2021, and at that time I googled alot but didn't find and scam posts. My money was teken out on 7 December. And I followed that address on etherscan, It is still taking money out of lots of wallets daily, But I hardly see any complaints on internet.  \nAlso permission was granted to that address when I bought the node, Coinbase made it easy for scammers, no confirmations, no info. Well I can go on....  \nI also feel very sorry for your loss. There needs to be more awareness. Hope only good things happen you in future.",
