It uses banking rails and simply spot sells your Bitcoin on some exchange. That isn't a circular Bitcoin economy and isn't using Lightning or other solution which transacts in a decentralized way. It's just giving crypto to banks.\n\nLightning integration in NCR, Shopify, etc. is REAL infrastructure and that is only a year in.
