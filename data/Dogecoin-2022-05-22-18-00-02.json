If our coins are off of the exchanges, the next run or huge catalyst, will force the exchanges to buy their own coins instead of trading or shorting ours.  \nThat huge buy alone from the exchanges to counteract demand, along with mass adoption and utilization of the coin, will cause the price of Dogecoin to rise.\n\nAlso, I hate the fact of them having control of my coins!",
