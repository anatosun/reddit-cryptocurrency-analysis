And instead of shipping them the grain of sand, sends them a confirmation of ownership.  Exchanges like coinbase help the man in exchange for a rake on transactions.\n\nReplace 'grains of sand' with \"A bunch of Contracts, Software code, ledgers, tethers, debts, and obligations\" that only someone who could create such a thing could understand, and you've got yourself a DAO.\n\nYou wanna buy one?  Mine doubled in price today.  Naturally the government is extremely uncomfortable about these things existing as well as the exchanges who let you trade them.  But since the Government hates crypto because it muscles in on their divine right to issue other people debt and spend the value created without consent of the indebted, it gives some leeway to scoundrels since it teaches you right for wanting an alternative store of your labor that they can't debase.",

They are decentralized due to existing anywhere the blockchain does, and they are autonomous because all the interaction rules are in the smart contracts.\n\nI'm not sure one actually exists yet.\n\nIt much more commonly abused as a buzzword for \"our project to do something involving a blockchain\".\n\n\"Smart contracts\" are bits of code attached to a wallet that contains verification rules for what transactions are acceptable.  The contract code is \"run\" as part of mining; if a contract address is part of a transaction, the verifier must pass for the transaction to be included in (any / the next) block.  The contract address is derived from the code of the contract, so the same verifier is being run on every miner.\n\nThe closest thing we have to DAOs are Uniswap and derived works, but if you look too deeply into most (if not all) of those, you'll still find some non-autonomous bits are that also generally not very distributed.",
