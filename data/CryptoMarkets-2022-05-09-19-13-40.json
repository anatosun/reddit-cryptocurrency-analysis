It is both an Inbound Oracle and an Outbound Oracle with features designed to ensure information validity and action traceability:\n\nOPEN - built from open source software, available as open source software for full transparency.\n\nTRUSTLESS - allows seamless public or private interaction within the network without requiring a trusted 3rd party.\n\nPERMISIONLESS - both consumers and providers can participate without being authorised by a governing body.\n\nPortus is a full-scale API Gateway. It is an API management tool which sits between a client and a collection of 3rd party services. It defines API endpoints that aggregates various external servicves and returns an aggregated results. One main component of the Portus network is the PORTKEY NODE. This is a piece of software that is both an INBOUND and OUTBOUND ORACLE, sitting on the API provider's premises.\n\n [Portus Network released a beta to its API Gateway called Portkey. You can find the beta here along with full documentation and tutorials on how to use it.](https://docs.portusnetwork.org/portkey-getting-started) \n\nPortus Network can processing 65000 transactions per second, is a super fast blockchain oracle.\n\nThere are NO MIDDLEMEN in Portus. The consumers are interacting directly with the API providers. There are NO FEES involved, with the exception of gas fees.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe project is currently in a private sale phase, with an upcoming public sale for individuals in Q2/Q3 2022. The project is partnered with Polygon and building on the MATIC chain.\n\nFor more details about private sale join on Telegram Group\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat makes it different from other oracle solutions currently available? Additional features that make Portus attractive and unique on the oracle market are the lack of validators and inclusion of an insurance system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.portusnetwork.org/](https://www.portusnetwork.org/) \\- Website\n\n[https://twitter.com/portusnetwork](https://twitter.com/portusnetwork) \\- Twitter\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/us9ejs5lzay81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1aec0ff0f57cac1ce94e432d1d642b301029991\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8q7e5mgkzay81.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6bc875a5758df380c4ce8bb5cbcd1400b436bf0\n\nWhy Portus Network?\n\n* Democratize the Data Oracle market: anybody can become a Data Provider\n* Replace validators with decentralized insurance and arbitratio\n* Engage the community through delegated staking insurance pools\n* Reduce complexity and hurdles: stateless node, no validators, no quadratic communication\n* Significantly lower fees, only the gas fees of every integrated blockchain to be paid\n* Bring all kind of external data in the blockchain, not only numbers: unlimited possibilities, Portus Network enables numerous functionalities of smart contracts\n* User friendly API Gateway that connects smart contracts with any event from the real world\n\nTechnology:\n\n* Stateless node that can be run by anybody, anywhere\n* Ultra high-performance message routing and validation\n* Create complex API orchestration workflows, combine APIs, apply transforms and validations\n* Multi-blockchain integration\n* Multiple messaging models: request-response, push-pull, fanout, inter-chain\n* Advanced circuit-breaker capability to prevent failures\n* Embedded message security: IP filters, quota, clickjacking protection, XSS protection etc.\n\n[https://www.portusnetwork.org/](https://www.portusnetwork.org/) \\- Website\n\n[https://twitter.com/portusnetwork](https://twitter.com/portusnetwork) \\- Twitter",

            "selftext": " \n\nBitcoin had a great run from October 2020 to the first half of 2021 and then after a correction of 61.8% levels in Fibonacci, it had another bull run from July 2021 to November 2021, subsequent to that Bitcoin has been seeing continuous bearish pressure with steady price action.\n\nBitcoin in monthly charts :\n\nIf we put up the Fibonacci levels from the last low point to the highest point we can observe that the current price of bitcoin is around the 50% retracement level, which is generally considered a great level from which bouncebacks happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bitcoin in monthly charts](https://preview.redd.it/f94gjx5yfxx81.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=e03a4362cef3d970d10eb27a056020b6f26c7504)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBitcoin in weekly charts:\n\nThe weekly charts are where things get interesting, there are so many things going on at this level that it can easily confuse traders and investors.\n\nFirstly if we see the bullish point of view, we can see that -\n\n1. The current trading price is at the lower support of a parallel channel pattern.\n2. It is also taking support from its 100 days exponential moving average.\n3. And lastly as pointed out in the monthly section, we can see that the price is hovering around 50% of the Fibonacci level, which is infamous to show some good rebounds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bullish View, reversal possible](https://preview.redd.it/u0ap6ievfxx81.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=507f4b09e16e99cc0c51da31ed9ea68e6c945c45)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the contrary, if we consider a bearish point of view, we can see that -\n\n1. The chart is forming a head and shoulder pattern with its breakdown approaching.\n2. The trend of the market is already bearish and thus it might continue its trend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bearish View, breakdown possible](https://preview.redd.it/yghzpdatfxx81.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a8af25bca9770562811e0137905dac068d5c18b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most important point here to note is that the market has been bearish for a long time and the fall has been pretty sharp since the last few days, thus a sudden recovery won\u2019t sustain rather we will need consolidation and then a breakout which might sustain and subsequently convert into a bull run.\n\nAt the same time, a breakdown of $34400 levels with the closure of a daily candle might be catastrophic since it will not only break the 100 EMA but also the Fibonacci level as well as the neckline of the head and shoulder pattern.\n\nNonetheless, wherever bitcoin goes HODLERS are gonna hold, so let\u2019s just sit tight and enjoy, maybe back to $20000 or to the moon.",

Many projects have found solutions to this dilemma.\n\nI think DaFi Protocol is a great example of this. They basically created a synthetic token based reward system that unlocks rewards based on adoption rather than a fixed time frame.\n\nThis type of system ensures that it is of the investors interest to watch the project succeed and to stay in it for the long term for more and more profits.\n\nIf more projects end up implementing a similar system, we\u2019d see FAR less pump and dump incidents in the market especially with startups.",
