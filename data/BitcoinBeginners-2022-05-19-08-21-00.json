Like I see many other transfers in my tx with much larger amounts, they paid most of the fee whereas I paid nothing because my amount is peanuts.",

In this case, that's Kraken.\n\nWhen the sending party is an exchange or similar business, they can decide to push that fee to the customer. In this case, Kraken charged you 0.00001 BTC. Some exchanges charge no fees to the customer to withdraw and pay the network fees out of their own pocket. Other exchanges charge a fee that is far higher than the network fee and profit from the difference (Binance is notorious for this).\n\nNote that some exchanges will group withdrawals from many customers into a single transaction. This reduces the size of the transaction compared to what it would be if each withdrawal had been a separate transaction. And that reduces the network fee per withdrawal, although the network fee paid for the entire combined transaction is relatively high.",

In this case the exchange payed the fee, **not you**, what you are looking at is the public blockchain to find out how much exchange payed, not you. \n\n\nSome exchanges charge a withdrawal fee, others do not. This is different than the miner tx fee. Some exchanges will overcharge clients as a backdoor tax(binance, bitstamp). Exchanges like cash app , swan and Gemini Active trader will charge 0 **withdraw** fee, and exchanges like coinbase will recoup the network fee they pay with a withdraw fee. Coinbase does transaction **batching**, where they pay a single larger fee for many **outputs** or withdrawals. This allows them to pay a high priority fee to get a quick confirmation to reduce support tickets and also reduce the withdraw per customer down to 1  to 4 usd per withdrawal that they than pass onto their clients.",

They have the right to do so because it is in their posession.\n\nYou can actually take posession of your Bitcoin, learn about self custody and make it a goal to get your coins off the exchanges.

That being said, we only charge the exact amount shown at the confirmation page when you make a withdrawal.\n\nHope this helps to clarify, please don't hesitate to [contact us](https://support.kraken.com) for any questions.\n\nCheers,\n\nOrange from Kraken",
