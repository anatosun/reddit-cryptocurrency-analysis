Even though we literally publicly state our goals the day prior leaving is really vulnerable to sabotage. \n\nWithin the demo there's narration which shows what needed to happen to fulfill the goal which were sub tasked completed as called for in sequence fulfilled and it's anticipated effects happen accordingly. LTC was called out as a source of arbitrage weighing down doge... We stated that if it would persist we'd have to do something about that... So as the crew held doge steady, we slammed LTC down 2 percent in about 1 minute. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/31OfZe4\n\nAfter which we stated that that should lighten the load on doge since LTC's rebound would cause a rise in doge from LTC new lower position.\n\nWhich is followed up by a post of that happening just as called by the post above. \n\nThats crowd power.\n\nComment 2 (same):\n\nThe reason why we give ourselves the extra challenge of giving warning the day prior and calling all our actions before they happen is for the sake of transparency and to demonstrate how things really work.. AND to show crowd power versus billionaires. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/uq4ytd/keep_up_the_good_work_guys_its_sunday_morning_as\n\nAll time stamped unedited and in sequence.",

We've ran countless demos as long as 3 days and we have never once failed. Our only goal was to fulfill on what the original reaction to his attempt to exploit this sub was, to sabotage him and reveal the manipulation. Beyond that all we aim for is stability.\n\nWhen we do reversals we follow with a phase of consolidation specifically because we don't intend to pump and dump and we do it all with full transparency announcing everything before we do it.
