So as BTC stagnates or falls, the price absorption gets put on LUNA to keep pegs, but the value falls due to BTC not going up and falls even more as LUNA goes down but stablecoins still can\u2019t keep pegs. \n\nAccording to the whitepaper, they expect some stablecoins to be above their peg, and that\u2019s what gets sold off to keep peg and add value. No stablecoin on their network is above the peg, which means LUNA is the only absorbent. \n\nWith no fiat backing, there is no price stability outside of artificial levers they can pull such as token allocation rates, selling off one token and removing it entirely, etc. \n\nSo BTC goes down, which makes value of network go down, which drives Luna down. Stablecoins lose their pegs and LUNA is sold to keep \u201cvalue.\u201d Which also brings LUNA price down. \n\nRight now people are only trying to get off of the network, not add more in, so LUNA is getting hit as hard as possible on all 3 fronts with no plan to recover other than hope they get financing for a billion dollars worth of BTC, which would only absorb a fraction of the losses the last 3 days.",

Here is the latest theory:\n\n\"Blackrock and Citadel borrowed 100K BTC from Gemini (it appears in their loan book). They swapped 25k of that BTC into UST; this was all done quietly in anticipation of the attack. When the time is right, they called up Do Kwon at Terra Foundation and said they wanted to sell a lot of BTC for UST. As it was a large trade they told him they didn't want to move the market and asked if he would like to buy their large block of BTW at a discount for UST. Do Kwan took the bait. He gave them a huge chunk of UST, thus lowering the UST liquidity significantly. At that point, Blackrock/Citadel dumped all of the BTC and UST causing massive slippage and triggering a cascade of forced selling in both assets. The real problem was Blackrock/Citadel knew that Anchor, which holds a lot of LUNA, was a Ponzi scheme (they offer 20% staking APY for Christ's sake) and this crash would trigger more withdrawals than Anchor can repay. These forced withdrawals and selling would trigger a massive selloff in Luna, thus further breaking the $1 peg and wrecking the market further.\n\nBlackrock and Citadel can now buy the BTC back cheaply to repay the loan and pocket the difference. Meanwhile, billions of longs and Bitcoin VaR were wiped out.\"",

In the event that holders all want to redeem at the same time and there is no new demand coming in..... Have a guess the REAL value of stablecoin A? \n\n$0.01 each! \n\nThese stablecoins that are not fully backed rely on user demand. If that demand dries up, the stablecoin is worth whatever assets it holds on the books / number of tokens.",

I'm not here to discuss the how and why.\n\nDoes Binance offer any kind of protection on the stablecoins it lists? I understand LUNA being a coin just like every other on the platform, so the losses there are the investor's responsibility.   \nBut since UST is a stablecoin and Binance listed it, would they reimburse people if it went to 0 or something happened to totally wipe it out? When you put your money into a stablecoin you reasonably expect it to be stable or in the worst case slightly depeg, not go down over 50%.  \n I'm not talking about goodwill, just purely related to its terms of service/EU law regarding these. I know there's some limited protections but I'm not sure if anyone could give me confirmation.",

            "selftext": "The Binance Blockchain (BNB) has been integrated into Opera's crypto browser. Users will be able to buy BNB crypto tokens with fiat, send and receive them using the built-in Opera crypto wallet, and use decentralized apps (dApps) such as PancakeSwap, 1inch, and BiSwap, as well as innovative DeFi products such as DRIP Venus, Tranchess, Treehouse, ApeSwap, and AutoShark Finance. \n\nBNB is the world's largest smart contract blockchain, with the most daily active users and a diverse set of community-driven Dapps. GameFi dApps including StarSharks, as well as NFT apps like Galaxy and Mining apps like Minosis and Cudo miner are all supported with the Opera browser.\n\nThe browser company's integration comes after its much-anticipated iOS launch in April, which brought the service to millions of new users around the world. This comes after the browser's initial beta release in January for Mac, Windows, and Android. \n\nThe crypto browser includes a non-custodial Crypto Wallet that allows users to access crypto games and metaverse sites. A non-custodial wallet gives you complete control over your private keys because no third party is involved. The non-custodial crypto wallet supports the Ethereum, Polygon, and Celo blockchain ecosystems, with \"additional blockchain integration on the way,\" according to the firm. Users will be able to buy cryptocurrencies with fiat, send and receive cryptocurrency, as well as NFTs, using this wallet.\n\n\"We are certain that today's integration with the BNB Chain ecosystem will provide new and veteran Web3 customers with even more capabilities.\" \"With a number of leading BNB Chain dApps already onboarded, and the Opera Crypto Browser's user-friendly and intuitive interface, Opera continues to provide meaningful utility and user friendliness that is required for Web3 to achieve long-term mass adoption,\" said Jorgen Arnesen, EVP Mobile at Opera. \n\nAdditionally, the Opera crypto browser includes \"Crypto Corner,\" a news and data aggregator and bespoke start page that includes live crypto updates, crypto-asset price reporting, crypto events, airdrops, and more. Users can also access Web3 apps and domains as easily as any Web2 domain \u2013 simply by typing the address into the address bar.",
