In the event that holders all want to redeem at the same time and there is no new demand coming in..... Have a guess the REAL value of stablecoin A? \n\n$0.01 each! \n\nThese stablecoins that are not fully backed rely on user demand. If that demand dries up, the stablecoin is worth whatever assets it holds on the books / number of tokens.",

I understand LUNA being a coin just like every other on the platform, so the losses there are the investor's responsibility.   \nBut since UST is a stablecoin and Binance listed it, would they reimburse people if it went to 0 or something happened to totally wipe it out? When you put your money into a stablecoin you reasonably expect it to be stable or in the worst case slightly depeg, not go down over 50%.  \n I'm not talking about goodwill, just purely related to its terms of service/EU law regarding these.

GameFi dApps including StarSharks, as well as NFT apps like Galaxy and Mining apps like Minosis and Cudo miner are all supported with the Opera browser.\n\nThe browser company's integration comes after its much-anticipated iOS launch in April, which brought the service to millions of new users around the world. This comes after the browser's initial beta release in January for Mac, Windows, and Android. \n\nThe crypto browser includes a non-custodial Crypto Wallet that allows users to access crypto games and metaverse sites. A non-custodial wallet gives you complete control over your private keys because no third party is involved. The non-custodial crypto wallet supports the Ethereum, Polygon, and Celo blockchain ecosystems, with \"additional blockchain integration on the way,\" according to the firm. Users will be able to buy cryptocurrencies with fiat, send and receive cryptocurrency, as well as NFTs, using this wallet.\n\n\"We are certain that today's integration with the BNB Chain ecosystem will provide new and veteran Web3 customers with even more capabilities.\" \"With a number of leading BNB Chain dApps already onboarded, and the Opera Crypto Browser's user-friendly and intuitive interface, Opera continues to provide meaningful utility and user friendliness that is required for Web3 to achieve long-term mass adoption,\" said Jorgen Arnesen, EVP Mobile at Opera. \n\nAdditionally, the Opera crypto browser includes \"Crypto Corner,\" a news and data aggregator and bespoke start page that includes live crypto updates, crypto-asset price reporting, crypto events, airdrops, and more. Users can also access Web3 apps and domains as easily as any Web2 domain \u2013 simply by typing the address into the address bar.",
