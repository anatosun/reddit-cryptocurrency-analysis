            "selftext": "\ud83d\udcca Bitcoin is still in the same tight range of $28,800 \u2013 $30,800. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have much movement and it\u2019s the silence before the storm with a big storm coming from both sides. Bitcoin cannot break even the $30,800 local resistance level. The market is very volatile right now and the trend in the market is still bearish. The index of greed and fear is: 12 - and this is an indicator of extreme fear. Despite the growth of BTC dominance, which now stands at: 45.4%, but at the same time, the trading volume decreased to $30.37 million. This indicates that the dominance growth occurred due to internal market resources, and not due to external resources . The most likely scenario is that Bitcoin will fall to the level of $22,000 - $20,000. If this happens, we will witness the onset of a \u201ccrypto winter\u201d. You can find out about the onset of the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d, and about the trends and aspects of its course in my article, which will be published in the coming days.  \n\ud83c\udfdb US markets are on a positive wave with the prospect of further growth, except for Bitcoin futures: S&P 500 +0.95% | NASDAQ +1.51% |Dow Jones +0.60%|CME (Bitcoin futures) -1.41%.",
