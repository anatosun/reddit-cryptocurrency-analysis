Unlike some other ecosystems in crypto, people are encouraged to express their opinions without fear of being \"shunned\" from the community, he added. This allows for a diverse set of debates and discussions to happen publicly in a healthy way.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.
