Whenever I ask coinbase about this I receive this automated response: \" \n\n*\"If you sent unsupported cryptocurrency to Coinbase or sent cryptocurrency to a wallet that isn\u2019t specifically for that cryptocurrency, we may soon be able to recover your funds.*\u00a0\n\n*We're developing a service to help recover some of these cryptocurrencies, which should roll out later this year.\"*\n\nI last received this response 2 weeks ago, and the first time was about 9 months ago. Whenever I ask for information about this service, I just get more automated responses. Can we please get an update on this? Howcome binance, kraken, kucoin are all able to easily send you back your unsupported erc20's but coinbase claims it is impossible? This is not right.",

They\u2019ve stated they\u2019d like to add send/receive/hold for most assets (even those not tradable).\n\nDoesn\u2019t make the situation any less aggravating.\n\nAt this point until I see something back on their website mentioning the service - my assumption is that it got cancelled or significantly delayed. \n\nI would think they would utilize the existing feature where customers can link their self custody coinbase wallet app to their CB exchange account. Seems like it would be simple to transfer over the unsupported erc-20 that way given it\u2019s one ETH wallet address and they can \u201cverify\u201d it\u2019s being transferred to the owner of the coinbase account via the link.",

This process took me nine months to figure out, but similar situation, I sent harmony one to my ERC20 addy within the Coinbase application.  It will never show up on your coinbase.com app.  First, download MetaMask In the App Store or Google play store and then sign up. Retrieve your 12 word recovery phrase from Coinbase and then import to MetaMask.

If you can\u2019t figure it out, look at the top right corner, you\u2019ll see an + click that and that\u2019s how you add one. Go onto Google and search step-by-step instructions \u201chow to add Harmony network within MetaMask\u201d and follow that step-by-step, when complete, switch to Harmony network within your MetaMask application and boom your coin will be in your wallet in MetaMask",

Moving back the CETH back to Coinbase exchange, my fault I thought the CETH would become Ethereum. I mean, if they sell it in one Coinbase application, wouldn't be available in all applications ?? \n\nThey could have prevented this mistake by programmatically preventing this in THEIR wallet.\n\nThey want to shove all responsibility to the user.",

                    "response": "Monday I converted my $35.000 of $BNB to USD Stablecoin on Gate.io\r  \n\r  \nAfter that, I wanted to convert it to euros on my Coinbase account, so I sent the USD Stablecoin to my Coinbase. I knew I had to look out for the network of course, as the $USDC adress of Coinbase only accepts ERC-20 tokens.\r  \n\r  \nThe unfortunate thing is that when you convert your crypto to USD Stable Coin on gate.io\r, you can withdraw several USD stable coins such as $HUSD, $BUSD, $TUSD and $USDC. I just looked at the network (ERC-20) and thought I withdrawed $USDC. Unfortunately, it turned out later that I had withdrawed the ERC-20 $HUSD. Yes, I know this is my fault and that I should have tried a small transaction first, but I can't change it anymore.\r  \n\r  \nCoinbase has not listed $HUSD and says they cannot return the tokens. The tokens are only credited automatically when Coinbase lists $HUSD on their exchange.\r  \n\r  \nI emailed the Huobi Trust CEO about this, as Huobi is the exchange behind stablecoin $HUSD (just like Binance is the exchange behind stablecoin $BUSD and Coinbase is the exchange behind stablecoin $USDC). He said the following:\r  \n\r  \n'We will continue to work hard to communicate with coinbase. But I can't be sure when $HUSD will be listed. But you do have the right to find coinbase to recover your assets. If any customer mistakenly deposits a token that is not listed on Huobi, Huobi will assist in retrieving it, or even advance payment. In fact, you did deposit your assets into the coinbase address. I believe that as long as you keep looking for them to solve the problem, they will help you. After all, $35,000 is not a small sum. Good luck.'\r  \n\r  \nSee my transaction on etherscan:\r  \nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x12a231dc8801724334895452f41dce8cb621d2db584c969bbe3c7fa6b9efa78d",
