Reason for buying is I hope it will be worth more in the future and then I can sell it. Is PayPal ok for this use or am I missing something? I understand I can't use the bitcoin to buy anything. Is there any other negatives of PayPal bitcoin?",

It depends on a lot of factors, since they have to comply with all kinds of state and national laws.\n\nA lot of people are fine with a third party holding their Bitcoin, but some people see it like allowing a third party to hold their gold bars. If you believe you can secure your gold as good or better than another company, and you believe you may need instant, unrestricted access to it, why would you take a chance with an IOU?\n\nThere are points to be made for all views, and no true right or wrong answer; it's really about your personal view on the risks.",
