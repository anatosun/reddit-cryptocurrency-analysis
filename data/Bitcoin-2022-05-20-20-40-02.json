This was basically a well written letter by Fidelity - there are some other things that could have been said, but I think they tailored and limited it considering the limited worldview of the intended recipient.\n2. Apart from this, there is a Congressperson, Byron Donalds, who introduced a bill which is intended to protect the use of bitcoin (and various cryptocurrencies) in retirement accounts - [the initial bill's text as released (not yet numbered) is here](https://donalds.house.gov/uploadedfiles/financial_freedom_act_bill_text.pdf).  According to a page which describes this bill, \"Original co-sponsors of this legislation include: Representatives Warren Davidson (OH-08), Young Kim (CA-39), David Schweikert (AZ-06), and Tom Emmer (MN-06).\" It appears the bill has been titled \"The Financial Freedom Act\" and it \"is in response to March 10th regulatory guidance released by the Employee Benefits Security Administration, an agency inside of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). The guidance attempts to bar 401(k) investors from investing in cryptocurrency and undermines the ability of 401(k) plans to offer [brokerage windows](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brokerage_window.asp), which give retirement plan participants the ability to personally control how their assets are invested. The guidance threatened that employers and investment firms could be subject to a DOL investigation and enforcement actions should they allow individuals using brokerage windows to invest in cryptocurrency. This legislation would empower retirement savers to invest as they see fit and ensure that plan sponsors and financial firms are not punished for allowing investors to exercise financial freedom. On May 5, 2022, Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) introduced identical legislation in the United States Senate.\" (Note:  You know that the administration / Department of Labor will also be coming for [self-directed bitcoin IRAs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-directed-ira.asp) next (even though they lack the legal authority to do so) since they already are gunning for brokerage windows in 401ks.  It's just a matter of time, since they feel that they have to erase individual control over everything.  So it's appropriate to say they must be stopped with whatever tools are available to do so, Congressional, the courts, etc.)\n3. O.K, three satoshis.  Here's my third satoshi on this subject:  It's worth noting that people have been using bitcoin (and other crypto systems for that matter) as / in lieu of ordinary retirement systems for years.  I personally know very few people who no longer know anything about bitcoin and the number who don't own some are dwinding (although there are still plenty who don't own any).  My own father owns some.  When your parents and / or grandparents own it, and banks and institutions have gotten into it, I'd say it's fairly mainstream.  What is the best way to hold your bitcoin? [You hold it in your hardware wallet or, in a Wyoming licensed organization which ensures you have the rights to your keys / coin](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/uqzm2h/wyoming_1st_place_in_world_to_recognize_digital/).  That said, people will be looking for ways to easily integrate bitcoin into their \"retirement porfolio\" without fuss.  Companies that find ways to make this happen will do well.  People currently have it in their hardware wallets, there are some people who have 401k operating agreements or IRA LLCs they use to set up business accounts on crypto exchanges and handle it themselves in a \"self-directed\" manner (this has been going on for I don't know how many years), and there is nothing illegal about it.  It's just people managing their own assets, self-directed.  And there are various organizations that have specialized services such as [iTrustCapital](https://itrustcapital.com/), BitcoinIRA (these two are IRA service related, and have been operating for a long time, that have slick UI/UX but also technically provide that what you are interfacing with is \"self-directed\"), or [Forusall](https://www.forusall.com/pricing) (an example of a crypto 401k service in development), and of course Fidelity (which now is offering the ability to have bitcoin in 401k, but **has been accepting bitcoin since 2015!**); **this latest 401k development is probably triggering the administration because it instantly means adoption for all employers as Fidelity Investments is in fact the largest 401(k) custodian in the United States.**  But the U.S. government is in denial if they think they can stop Fidelity (or anyone else for that matter) from keeping bitcoin in custody (in any form - self custody or any other sort of custody) for whatever end - be it retirement or any other matter.  Rep. Byron Donalds was right, stating that with respect to the Department of Labor's reaction, that **\u201cThis administration, as well as any other government entity, lacks the authority to direct the financial future of America\u2019s investors.\"**",

And that lie you need to stop telling yourself is that you missed the boat on Bitcoin. Because that boat has not even started to pull away from the harbor yet, let alone gone out to sea, or arrived at its destination. \n\n\u201cLook at how expensive a whole bitcoin is, \u201d you might worry. Well, for one, it takes 30 satoshis to add up to just one cent right now. That\u2019s the base unit of Bitcoin. You can still buy 30 of those for a penny. But this is only a minor point.\n\nBut do you know where the good ship Bitcoin is headed? It\u2019s not to $100,000 or $1 million a coin. Not even $10 million or $100 million. Where we\u2019re going, they don\u2019t have dollars. We\u2019re going to the future. And you don\u2019t have to look too far into the past to see that the dollar\u2019s future is in big trouble, because the incompetent, corrupt, and dishonest people who administer that centralized shitcoin project are trying to fool you and to fool themselves with claims that everything is fine, when the house is actually on fire. \n\nIn the future, there truly are no people in charge of the money. It\u2019s not a battle over who can seize power over some territory and then use that power to print money for their armies of soldiers, bureaucrats, and tax collectors to seize the wealth produced by those who do actual work. \n\nLook around though. That\u2019s not the present. So you haven\u2019t missed the boat. But if instead of getting in that boat, way early still, you\u2019re pretending that a jpeg of a rock or an ape is the future, or that some staking, algorithmic, yield farming, smart contract blockchains do anything besides fooling people into investing in them, well then, stop fooling yourself! \n\nBitcoin is here. It\u2019s waiting. It\u2019s waiting for you. Come aboard and experience what it\u2019s like to stop fooling yourself, and to stop fooling others, and to stop fooling around.",

I definitely understand the concern but ppl seems way too paranoid about this too me. Surely more value is stollen from ppl in this world in the form of cash, jewelry, bikes, alcohol or any other common type of items that thieves target. \n\nSurely OP has a neighbour on either side of them that are in the exact same financial class as them that have a similar amount of valuables waiting to be stollen from their homes. The idea that advertising bitcoin makes them an easier target is kind of silly, unless most theives are willing to increase their potential jail time by adding kidnapping, assault and attempted murder to their resume when they use a 5$ wrench attack or drill out someones knees like so many ppl in this thread are suggesting.",
