You might consider collateralizing ETH in order to borrow stablecoins.*\" Excuse my language but what kind of fucking problem does this actually solve? You want to sell ETH; fine - but because you dont want to \"get rid of your tokens\" you come up with this \"\"\"ingenious\"\"\" idea to lock up your tokens which fulfills the exact same thing you were trying to avoid in the first place only to ON TOP OF THAT pay EXTRA INTEREST. In what world does this actually make any sense what so ever?",

You seriously need to spend time in finance (in general) first it seems.\n\nTo simplify...\n\nForget crypto or anything decentralized for now. Let's say, you have a car. Like any asset, it has liquidity to an extent, right? Now imagine if you need to cash NOW (but you are not gonna get paid in a month) but don't necessarily want to sell your car. You can then find someone who will lend you the money you need with your car as a collateral (assurance in case you run away with the loan). So long as you pay the loan back (granted with some sort of arrangement on the interest), you don't have to sell your car and you get the cash that you needed at the time. It's like being able to get the money that you can get in the future (but want to use it now) by paying a bit more money (interest).",

I was thinking too much in terms of 'mortgage type' loans where you DONT need enough liquidity to cover the entire loan if payments where to stall - which again, would not work in the crypto world since you actually need to be able to cover 100% since there is no other way to penalize someone who does not furfil their promise to repay.",
