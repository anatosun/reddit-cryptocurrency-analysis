                    "response": "ETH2 merge will not scale Ethereum though. It will only get a couple TPS boost from POS. Additionally, staked ETH will remain locked. The risk is that what if we see a bull run this year and people are not able to sell because their ETH2 is locked. Also, what if there is no adoption of the chain other than stakers because of high transaction fees? I think that the internet computer integrating Ethereum this year solves a lot of these problems. You will still be able to use Ethereum DApps and trade, but with low fees.",
