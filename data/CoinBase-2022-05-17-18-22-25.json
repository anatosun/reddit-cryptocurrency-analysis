            "selftext": "so I've had the coinbase card for several months now and I was originally getting 4% back on AMP. I would receive rewards for pretty much every single transaction I did except for cash back transactions. because those transactions were considered withdrawals which received no rewards. from restaurants to gas stations to buying something on amazon, I was receiving rewards on every single transaction. well ever since the crypto rewards rotated, now I selected xlm. every other day I go to a Martin's grocery store and purchase what I need and would always receive the 4% back in AMP. Even when i go to the ABC Liqour store id get rewarded. well this morning as I had xlm selected as a reward I went to get McDonald's and I can see in my history that it is pending and showing my estimated reward amount. but I also went to the grocery store and a liquor store and the transaction is shown only as completed and highlighted in green. from my experience when it's showing completed in green highlight, that pretty much means that you are not receiving a reward and your transaction was considered withdrawal or not considered a transaction that can receive any credit. has anybody had an issue yet with this new rotated crypto rewards on their transactions?",
