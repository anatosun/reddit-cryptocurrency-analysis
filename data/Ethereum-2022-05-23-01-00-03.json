They didn't know what would happen back then, you're relevantly saying it yourself. To have the surge in mining difficulty we're seeing now, it would need to be many more GPUs entering the market than what we generally see, even more so if electricity prices are even higher now than before. To me, there's something more than just people piling up GPUs. \n\nBut I think we're forgetting one aspect of the problem: the difficulty bomb. People know about it. They know it's different from beforehand because of it. And it will impact the mining difficulty more and more over time. Maybe there's something about that too, if at least psychological regarding miners themselves. \n\nBut again, that's only my thoughts. Feel free to add more if you find anything relevant.",

A 3090 can generate about 125 megahash/second at say, 320 watts, but you can get 120 megahash for around 280 watts, so that might make more sense.  The full unlock made a big difference for LHR cards, but I think most miners had only a few of those.  As an example, a 3080 ti with the old, 71% unlock would get around 85 megahash/second, but with the 100 percent unlock it's about 118 megahash.  This helped a bit, but the majority of my cards are not LHR.\n\nI think that once the merge happens, used hardware prices will plunge.  I suspect profitability will plunge on other coins, since the mining power currently active will migrate to other platforms.\n\nI'm glad we had the extensions from the previous difficulty bombs.  There was always the expectation that Ethereum would always go proof of stake, but the delays have made it possible to mine far past the point where the initial capital investment has paid for itself. \n\nI have a locked rate of 7.54 cents/kWh, but after the fees and such it works out to around 15.00 cents/kWh (that's Canadian dollar BTW)  If that gets me about 0.42 Eth per month, so at the current price 2512.87 that gives me   1055.41 dollars.  Power is 558.00 or so, so that gives 497.41 after power.   When power costs come close to income, I think the GPU miners will drop off, then a while later the ASIC miners will drop off.  Maybe there will be a perfect storm of cheap hardware from miners, followed by the release of 4000 series GPUs so some lightly used (read: beaten like a rented mule) cards will be available at a reasonable price.  Once mining becomes unprofitable, I'll switch to something that is, or stop mining if nothing is available.",
