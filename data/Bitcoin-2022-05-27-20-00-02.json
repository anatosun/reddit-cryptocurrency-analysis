Bitcoin users to a large extent trust Bitcoin to retain its value, especially over long time frames.

If supply is steady or declining and value increases as a function of supply, it's a given that saving will usually yield better utility than spending. Negating the advantage of compound interest, this makes the increasingly common Millennial belief that Bitcoin is retirement money a fairly safe bet despite short term swings (hence the popular \"zoom out, DCA, hodl\" advice).",
