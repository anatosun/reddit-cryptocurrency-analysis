You tell the seller, that if everything works well today with 1k, tomorrow will be 2k, the day after 3k and so on... or however you decide to split it up. Don't say where the limit is and just disappear after your last purchase.\n\nIt could still be somewhat risky, but you created an incentive over time to not scam you.",
