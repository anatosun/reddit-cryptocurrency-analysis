You can also get the private key for this wallet from the SoDogeTip website. You can transfer dogecoins into this wallet address and begin giving dogecoin to other people on reddit! And using your key you can also send coins yourself, even if the tipbot is down\nMaybe you see a meme that made you laugh? Give them a few dogecoin.\nMaybe you see an insightful post that helped you understand something better? Give them a few dogecoin.\nMaybe you see a charity you'd like to donate to. Do it with sodogetip. \n\nYou can also get the latest version of the dogecoin wallet (version  1.14.5) from www.dogecoin.com \n\n---\n\nHere are some links and topics that people have wanted me to post here.

            "selftext": "Gucci, the high-end fashion house, has announced that it would soon accept Dogecoin payments in its locations. Dogecoin has been a powerful competitor in the payments market due to its massive supporting base as well as the fact that it is a cryptocurrency with very cheap transaction fees. Various brands have jumped on board to capitalize on the meme coin, with Gucci being the most recent to do so. This represents a good news for both the selected cryptos, blockchain projects like Nature Vault, Cycled, Hydrominer and so on and the general crypto markets.\n\nGucci has announced that it would begin taking the meme coin Dogecoin as a form of payment, according to Vogue Business. This follows the company's recent decision to accept cryptocurrency payments at its retail locations. Dogecoin was included among the top cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Gucci will accept crypto payments in over ten different digital currencies.\n\nCrypto payments are expected to be available later this month across a variety of retail outlets, but only a few will be available at first. Wooster Street in New York, Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles, Miami Design District, Phipps Plaza in Atlanta, and The Shops at Crystals in Las Vegas are among the first establishments to accept these cryptocurrency as payment. \n\nShiba Inu, a competitor of Dogecoin, has also been added to the list of cryptos that will be accepted by these Gucci outlets. Bitcoin Cash, Wrapped Bitcoin, Litecoin, and a total of five stablecoins pegged to the US dollar are among the others.\n\nAll cryptocurrency payments will be done via a QR code or an NFC reader that will be available at these stores' point of sale terminals. According to the release, customers will be able to pay for things using their smartphones, and payments will be instantaneously converted to fiat currency or maintained in the cryptocurrency in which they were paid.\n\nThe announcement of a global company like Gucci accepting crypto payments is a significant step forward for the crypto business. Dogecoin, on the other hand, has not treated this news with the respect that its investors would expect. The meme coin, which had risen after Musk's bid to buy Twitter was accepted, had since fallen into a long-term downward trend. \n\nDespite the news that Gucci will accept Dogecoin payments, the downturn has continued. It is still trending at $0.13, with no clear signs of considerable upward momentum. This is due to the digital asset's low momentum, which has seen it lose almost 700,000 investors since the beginning of 2022.\n\nSince Elon Musk, the \"Dogefather,\" has yet to complete his acquisition of Twitter, the meme coin is likely to be waiting for the news to surface. Musk, on the other hand, appears to have found a new pet project in ApeCoin after changing his Twitter profile photo to BAYC avatars, prompting the cryptocurrency to gain 20% in minutes.",

I think he will eventually because doge = maximum fun, but I don\u2019t see why he\u2019d announce when the market is bearish like this it would make more sense to make an announcement when it\u2019s up to make a bigger splash no? \n\nFor context I\u2019m gonna hodl for a few years since I only own like 6k doge (down like $200 right now) and I\u2019m doing this to learn about the market but it\u2019s fun to see what causes a pump",
