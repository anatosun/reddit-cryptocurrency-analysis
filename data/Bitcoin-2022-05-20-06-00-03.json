            "selftext": "Out of the estimated 100 million + bitcoin holders on earth:\n\n50% are in it for the speculative gains and have no idea how technologically transformative bitcoin will be. They own it because they heard stories of other people getting rich.\n\n30% understand bitcoins potential but are not convinced it will work. They still have faith in government authority and central banks and dont see a world without banks visa and mastercard. For them bitcoin is a bet and they hold it just incase it works.\n\n20% are actual bitcoin believers who understand bitcoin can not be stopped and that it is the only logical way forward for humanity regardless of how much FUD they hear.\n\nThe first two groups are the ones that sell as it falls and buy back in as it rises to new highs. The last group are the ones that buy more, the further it falls the more they buy. This is what causes bitcoins volatility and periods of dramatic over and under valuation.\n\nThis is not ideal but fortunately this metric will become irrellevant over the coming months and years as institutions become the biggest group of holders, they will be buying it because it will be integrated into their operations or to hedge their USD denominated balance sheet risk. As institutions become the biggest group of holders volatility will dramatically decline to that of any large forex pair like JPY/EUR or CAD/CHF. Within the next year or two bitcoin vs the USD will be no more volatile than any other major currency pair.",
