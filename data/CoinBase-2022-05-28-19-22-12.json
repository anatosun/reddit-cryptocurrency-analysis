My issue is that with each passing month this platform is becoming increasingly unstable and unreliable. There are several errors that happen on a weekly and sometimes daily basis. My bigger issue is that they are a publicly traded company, and yet management has not improved. My long standing issue is the iotx erc 20 and no answer on that either. I have a feeling that if things don't massively improve soon I will be leaving the platform. I had high hopes but this isn't looking good. I understand we are in a bear market. I understand this is new technology. But this is also getting a bit ridiculous.",
