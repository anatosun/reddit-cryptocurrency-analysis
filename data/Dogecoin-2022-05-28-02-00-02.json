When i first withdrawed the money after like 4-5 days the bank sent me a message and asked me where the money is from. I answeared \u00abfrom crypto\u00bb futher on they asked me to prove, i sent them the deposit from bank to exchange. Afterwards now they are asking for ALL the transactions and everything from when i deposited to when i sold and the wallets etc i been investing in lots of projects from memeprojects to being one of the first investor in safemoon,elongate etc \n\nI can not really give them all of this because i can not trace it neither do i want to give them all of this. I am really worried about this money, they will probably kick me out of the bank and flag me to other banks or blackmail me + report it to the police. The country is in nordic, denmark... anyone has any clue on what i should do? Can they just steal my money? I am so mad at them for all of those days...",
