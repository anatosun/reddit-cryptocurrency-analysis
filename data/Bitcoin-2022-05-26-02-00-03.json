Although Bitcoin seems to appeared abruptly out of nowhere, its foundations were laid throughout the digital era. \n\n  \nAnd let's not forget that Satoshi and the original collaborators were likely born between 1950 and 1970 ish, and honed their teeth on 1980s computer technology. So while Bitcoin came to life in 2009, it was gestating in the decades prior. \n\n  \nSo I think the answer is that technologically, bitcoin could have been invented earler. But the humans behind it were the source of the delay - you had to wait for the humans behind it to build up their skills and understanding.   \nSame with other similar paradigm shifts like the Wright Flyer. The tech to build it existed decades prior, but it took two young men with experience repairing bicycles that were fascinated with existing gliders and flying toys to make powered flight happen. \n\n  \nI'd point to similar cases with the other great inventors (Einstein, Edison etc). \n\n  \nSometimes the tech is there and you just need to wait for the right humans to come along.",

The fact that it was able to have a good amount of time as useless and to be spread around, Satoshi just disappearing and leaving his stash, etc etc. \n\nThe beautiful thing about Bitcoin is that due to everything that happened and the timing it occurred, it would be near impossible for another Bitcoin to occur if this one were to fail for whatever reason.",
