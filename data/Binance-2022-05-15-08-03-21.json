Earlier holders will push for this though as they were most disadvantaged by the minting inflation to try hold peg. \n\nThey think you can just invalidate all the extra tokens and the people who bought them cheap so that earlier holders get made \"whole\".... What they fail to grasp is that doing it that way destroys all trust in the project of everyone external and the project never gains the influx of new users after tge fork and it withers and dies over the next 6-12mths. \n\nIf they go this direction, they would have to not warn the wider market, pick a date and time and halt the blockchain. At that moment, whatever the trading value was of ALL tokens minted after the snapshot from before the crash, get reimbursed at current market value to those new holders. Burn the new tokens, then fork or do whatever. \n\nIt's the only way to even hope that the wider market might trust LUNA again. Without that trust, no fork can save this clusterfuck! It will just be a circle jerk of OG holders who eventually realise not enough new money is entering to increase the bag value enough to exit. \n\nSeen it happen over and over and over and over again! Mark this comment and check back in in 12mths. \n\nI really hope for OG holders it works out....  but sadly, it won't.",

You announced the end of trading on the Luna pairs, without putting it in the form of a message on the interface \"Trades\" of the application, while you know that the traders at the time are all on the charts, know that we are not always on Twitter, reddit or Binance announcement ... So you play with the tools, to create this scam, the proof is that Luna to drop a thousandth in not even 20min, from 0.045 usdt to 0 usdt You have created wealth for a few (yours) and you have swindled money to others. What happened with the Terra Luna Foundation is surely a strategic, technical and financial problem. But you, it's totally different, you have created a panic situation (snowball effect) to create the opportunity in a malicious way. I believe that Binance users should stop believing in your official announcements.",
