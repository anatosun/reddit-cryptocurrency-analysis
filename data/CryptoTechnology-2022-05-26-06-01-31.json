I will not go so far as to say it is \"revolutionary\" or anything, as it is just an improvement on existing published theory, modified to fit a specific niche case in finance (the improvements come with tradeoffs which I deem acceptable for my use case). \n\nI have created a small proof of concept in order to test my theory. It has passed all scenarios I can think of, but obviously there are people out there who are much smarter than me.\n\nAre there any scripts or papers out there that compiles a list of the most common attack vectors to a consensus algorithm so I can stress test my algorithm?",

Since you borrow from Solana I would assume you use VDFs to have a proof of history and then voting using PBFT. If true, then the attack vectors are outlined in Solana WP. For PBFT, scalability is an issue, which hinders decentralization. \nYou may not be able to run PBFT on thousands od nodes due to it being a 3 phase protocol that requires a lot of message passing.",

Turns out despite dozens of devs working on it for years, these systems are complicated and things can go wrong if they aren't battle-hardened. Bitcoin had a lot of issues and bugs when it was first released, despite Satoshi being a really smart guy. You can't firgure this out on your own, it's way too complex. There is no checklist. Also I doubt your breakthrough idea is as simple as the original Bitcoin spec so this is even more true for whatever novel mechanisms people come up with. Nakamoto consensus is arguable fairly easy to understand, and yet even most of the Bitcoin users don't really have any idea about it.",
