It is a digital currency based on Binance Smart Chain and follows peer-to-peer architecture. Catcoin are tokens with a limited supply of 100,000,000,000,000,000 (one hundred quadrillions).\r  \n\r  \nIt is a deflationary cryptocurrency which means that the total supply decreases with time. Catcoin has lower inflation than other cryptocurrencies. Over time, it becomes more valuable as inflation can eat away at your investment if you do not manage your portfolio well enough. There is high chance that Catcoin.com will become next dogecoin,dogecoin is backed by Elon musk and Elon musk also loves cats, So if elon musk adopt catcoin just like he adopt dogecoin then this project will do 1000x.",
