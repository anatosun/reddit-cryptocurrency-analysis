I have setup my MetaMask wallet but my knowledge of MM is limited. Is MetaMask just a L1 ethereum based solution? Should I send my AMP to MM or CB wallet? I might want to stake them because it seems like a long term hold.\nEDIT: I don't answer DMs so please give it a rest scammer idiots.",

Ease of use, network support etc..\n\nAn important thing to know though is a wallet (like CB wallet or MetaMask) is just software to view and interact with your actual wallet on a blockchain. Your private key allows the software (like CB wallet) to operate that wallet (like send tokens and interact with defi for instance).\n\nThe reason this is important to know is that you can change your wallet software by usually importing your wallet into the new software using the same 12 word seed phrase.\n\nSo you could create a wallet with CB wallet and then import that wallet into Trust Wallet using the same seed phrase and have your wallet in both, its fine to have them at the same time in fact (I have some wallets I do this with).\n\nIt\u2019s a simple process to use a different wallet, if your unsure create a test wallet with CB wallet and try to import it into MetaMask or Trust or Whatever else and see.\n\nNever share your seed phrase (never ever), always double check you are using official sources for wallet software!",
