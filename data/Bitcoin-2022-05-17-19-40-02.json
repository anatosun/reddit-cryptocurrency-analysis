I'm genuinely struggling to think of something that hasn't gone up by *at least* 10%. \n\nI'm likely going to get a sub 2% raise this year, so effectively it's going to be a >7% cut and that's highly conservative, based on CPI figures that are clearly made up. It's probably going to be more like a 10-15% pay cut if I'm lucky.\n\nThank fuck I've got some bitcoin.",
