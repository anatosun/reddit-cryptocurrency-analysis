            "selftext": "Whether you're a retail or institutional virtual asset trader, you want to be sure the platform you're using has the lowest latency and fees, as well as the greatest security standards. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case.\n\nThe virtual asset markets suffer from different issue such as  exchange-to-exchange liquidity fragmentation,  lack of best price discovery and execution,  market manipulation,  interoperability between venues, thin volume across trading pairs,  price disparity between venues,  lack of regulatory framework for institutional participation, major counterparty risks, high latency trades and wide spreads due to lack of liquidity, spreads can be vast.\n\nThese are issues that the industry faces, the most significant of which is latency, which no one has been able to address. Current options are costly and difficult to execute, necessitating a big initial investment.\n\n The Solution\n\n FLUID combines resources across member exchanges, connecting institutions and retail users with a universal order book.\u200b \u200b The technical architecture provides seamless interoperability between member exchanges, resulting in unified global liquidity and a stabilized market. \u200b \u200bThanks to the latest technology, multi-party transactions are settled instantly across all chains, exchanges, and trading pairs using a blockchain-based solution overlaying an MPC wallet architecture.\u200b\n\nFLUID's proprietary liquidity ensures that you obtain optimum rates for your transactions, assuring the best execution, ultra-low fees, and zero counterparty risk.

Value is **subjective**, if i and the other person find that the specific item has value, then that means it has value because we can use it to trade goods and services for it.\n\nIt doesn't need to backed by Gold if it's built on solid math. The reason currencies in the past were backed by Gold/Silver was to stop governments printing unlimited amounts of money, we were forced to use their currency.\n\nWith crypto currencies like BTC, we don't need Gold anymore to back it because it's decentralized, nobody can print more of it so the supply can't manipulated and it's backed by solid math.\n\n**Have a nice day Peter.**",

I guess that\u2019s what Peter is trying to say, but you are right that a lot of things have subjective value , yet are valuable , modern art comes to mind . so i guess you are both right",
