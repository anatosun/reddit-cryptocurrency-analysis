            "selftext": "I was withdrawing multiple tokens this morning when, all of the sudden, I got booted out and asked to login again. After logging in, the site told me my account had been locked and asked me to verify my identity.\n\nI have allowlisting enabled and 2FA, I've been a customer for many years, and pretty much do the same thing every paycheck (withdraw most things then DCA into a few tokens). Typically, I don't withdraw tokens on Ethereum until I've DCA'd enough that the gas fees are a small enough percentage to justify the transfer. So, the only difference between this paycheck and most others was that I was transferring out some tokens on Ethereum.\n\nSo, besides venting, I guess my reason for posting this is: I'd like to know why this happened so that I can avoid it in the future. Was it because I was withdrawing too many tokens all at once? Should I spread my withdraws over a couple days or something? If that's the case, isn't that the sort of thing allowlisting solves? And while I'm ranting about allowlists: why the fuck do I still need to copy/paste my addresses into the transfer modal? Why can't I just select my allowlisted address like I can in the Coinbase Pro interface?\n\n\ud83d\ude21",
