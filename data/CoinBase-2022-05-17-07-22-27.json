            "selftext": "I recently bought a Ledger Nano S, went and sent my whole ETH and BTC balance to it but 2 weird things have happened. Firstly I seemed to receive a lot less ETH than I was expecting, I had 0.25is but only received 0.17, I'm guessing I got fucked with transfer fees. But the second problem is now I seem to have a portfolio that is inflated by roughly the same amount that went missing. \n\n[here is the portfolio on coinbase at the moment](https://prnt.sc/OXWgyg1_TVPK)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhen adding the two together you get around 70 GBP, so what is the other 130? also weirdly 130gbp is roughly 0.08eth which is the gap I had when transferring to my Nano S?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have no idea where I'd even start with support, refreshing and relogging and clearing cache did nothing so I'm stumped",
