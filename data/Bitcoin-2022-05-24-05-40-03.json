What if QE is a strategy to do that more gradually than China would and to own assets the Fed could sell to soak up those extra dollars were China to dump US currency.\n\nI hate to defend the Fed, and this is just my own reverse/\"good\" conspiracy theory, but does it have any merit? If so, what would the Fed's ability to hold the Dollar stable mean for our beloved BTC?",

If default rates rise we could see things cascade out of control again. All this printed money that never had value attached to it will vanish and the value of Bitcoin theoretically would go down against the dollar since the demand for dollars would rise. This is of course until the demand for bitcoin outpaces the demand for USD (or the supply of USD outpaces the supply of BTC).",
