Zero. None. \n\nMoney on bank accounts is protected. Stocks on Broker-accounts are protected. Crypto on exchanges is not. That's the entire point.

I don't think you quite realize how vicious the markets can get during a prolongued bear market. During the 2000's DOTCOM bubble, internet stocks fell by over 99%. What happenned to Luna last week is an appetizer for what's to come. DOGE is the thirdmost secure coin by hashrate, but you only benefit from that security if you keep your coins onchain. If you keep them with a custodian, well.... may Satoshi have mercy on your soul!",
