Coinbase charges you to add funds, they charge to buy on the exchange, sell on the exchange, and pay to remove your own funds back to your bank. \n\nAt EVERY level they are sneaking their hand in your pocket and the cost adds up. They arent even competitive in costs to many of the alternative methods to acquire coins. It's like visiting a carnival, pay to park, pay to play, pay to leave... not customer focused. \n\nRegarding their security, sure, they have a sound exchange. Since so many here appear to love coinbase, id love to hear how you feel about the updated TOS.\n\nWhen they recently updated their terms of service to note that if they file bankruptcy any coins held on their exchange are up for grabs...  \n\nI dont plan to leave anything on coinbose by year end. Moving to a cold storage for peace of mind.",

That alone sends you into trading with less than if you left it at your bank. \n\nYou would think that simple part of the process should allow people to add funds to the system so they can collect from trades. Nope, they want to get paid at entry, exit, everywhere... they have lost customer loyalty. They have institution customers so the retail doesn't seem to have their attention anymore. \n\nThey also have had many issues with support, namingly when they introduced gyen, that was a bust. Their support basically said too bad so sad and locked trades so their customers were unable to cash out.\n\nI've tried quite a few exchanges and for u.s. they are certainly in top of the game. But the game is changing and companies that care more about profits than their customer will soon have no customers. They would need one heck of a win back campaign. We shall see.",
