The goal is to deploy a Steam-competitor, where games are minted as NFTs, and the in-game assets are also NFTs.\n\nWe think about what the Metaverse can be a lot because it fits with a lot of the technologies that we have been building out.\n\n[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/r29onj/the_metaverse_is_an_absolute_joke/hm3erc7/) comment really sums it up pretty well: the Metaverse is not about stuff in a virtual world. It isn't about VR. \n\nThe Metaverse is about a digital representation of YOU that interacts with other people. We've been doing this already for DECADES, but in a wholly centralized, siloed format.\n\nHaving a unique identity with digital assets tied to it is the real value proposition for the Metaverse, and as you can imagine it dovetails PERFECTLY with blockchain tech (open, decentralized networks) and NFTs.",

                    "response": "The metaverse allows people to play games that they have control and ownership of the items in the metaverse.\n\nIf you play your favorite game 12 hours a day and gain abilities and tools to make you a very powerful player, you can actually sell for instance a sword to another player and make real money to pay for your real world expenses.\n\nThis is vastly different from the olden days of centralized gaming where only the top top players could make some money at tournaments.  And the centralized game owners f(or instance blizzard) can change the rules on you or to shut down the servers. This can't happen in a decentralized metaverse gaming system.\n\nPlay to earn and buy to play is going to be an ecosystem that will be mutually symbiotic for people who play the game as a career and for people who have an interest and the ability to buy the tokens or tools to allow them to become a better, more effective  player.\n\nAs an example I had a roommate who played world of Warcraft 20 hours a day and all he did was pay blizzard for the privilege to play and he never made any money from his work and he was frankly addicted.\n\nThe next world of Warcraft game, whatever it might be,  will allow the players to have control of their characters, tools, weapons and be able to buy, sell, trade & upgrade all the items in their control (NFTs) in a decentralized way on a marketplace and the centralized companies like blizzard can't pull the rug on the users.\n\nWe can all thank the creator of Vitalik for starting this after his experience with world of Warcraft:\n(Quote from the web);\n\nVitalik Buterin created ethereum, the technology behind the cryptocurrency ether, after World of Warcraft developers weakened his prized character.\nAccording to his\u00a0about.me page, he played World of Warcraft from 2007 to 2010 but decided to quit after game maker Blizzard nerfed his \"beloved warlock's Siphon Life spell.\"\n\"I cried myself to sleep,\" he wrote, \"and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring.",

I play games to escape reality, not to bring my reality into them and turn it all into a second job, having to compete with people because items are worth money.\n\nThere certainly is ways of integrating blockchains or NFTs into games. But no game has done it well. They all suck. Even the more famous ones like that Axie Infinity or whatever are absolute shit as games. Most (if not all) of these \u201cgames\u201d are thought of by financebros who want to exploit the hopeful. Not one is made by a game development team with experience making actual fun games.",

It\u2019s going to have its shitty graphics and tech like the original webpages back in the 90s but the potential for this space is truly unimaginable. If kids are using their mothers credit cards to purchase in-game weapons and skins now? Jesus\u2026what happens when these kids grow up and want to join in on the new tech boom? Again unimaginable.

Its basically unusable with its current form. Nobody in their right mind would use it unless they had to. People invest in eth or ada for the future. That itll get better.\n\nIts like seeing the first home game consoles n saying this is dumb. Nobody is gonna want to play games at home. People love arcades. N socializing. What a joke. Im not gonna invest in Nintendo dumb. \n\nDon't be short sided.\n\nYes many wont be successful. Yes many will be yrs away from a good experience. And many new metaverse plays will be complete scams. Like how we see meme coin scams. And no. Metaverse games won't end traditional video games. \n\nBut these r the risks an investor takes. Dyor. Invest if u think the future is bright. Or don't.",
