            "selftext": "Whether you're a retail or institutional virtual asset trader, you want to be sure the platform you're using has the lowest latency and fees, as well as the greatest security standards. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case.\n\nThe virtual asset markets suffer from different issue such as exchange-to-exchange liquidity fragmentation, lack of best price discovery and execution, market manipulation, interoperability between venues, thin volume across trading pairs, price disparity between venues, major counterparty risks, high latency trades and wide spreads due to lack of liquidity, spreads can be vast.\n\nThese are issues that the industry faces and are being solved uniquely by FLUID, a proprietary liquidity ensures that you obtain optimum rates for your transactions, assuring the best execution, ultra-low fees, and zero counterparty risk. It's run by a seasoned senior team with over 40 years of combined and diversified experience in tier-one financial institutions and has been building since 2019.\n\nThe Solution\n\nFLUID combines resources across member exchanges, connecting institutions and retail users with a universal order book.\u200b \u200b The technical architecture provides seamless interoperability between member exchanges, resulting in unified global liquidity and a stabilized market. \u200b \u200bThanks to the latest technology, multi-party transactions are settled instantly across all chains, exchanges, and trading pairs using a blockchain-based solution overlaying an MPC wallet architecture.\u200b\n\nI believe this will help us save time, money, and assets, as well as facilitate widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, by combining the best of the traditional finance industry and the crypto space. What do you think, fellas? Are there any other projects with similar utility that are helping users in obtaining the best price for their assets?",

There's the likes of Rango exchange as well doing that for Dexes; routing through Thorchain & Cosmos DEXs alike.\n\nBut I await FLUID product launch, probably could be better than both. Would also makes sense if there's a beta product before going Mainnet as I think those two had it.",
