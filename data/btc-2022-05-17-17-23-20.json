            "selftext": "The Bitcoin blockchain network has continued to receive a huge barrage of criticism owing to the architecture of the layer 1 network and its proof-of-work consensus model which makes it inefficient in terms of Transaction speed and cost.\n\nBitcoin mining, which is the popular lingo for describing how transaction validation is carried out, has even been banned in some nations due to its enormous energy consumption and carbon emission\u2026 all of which poses a threat to main scale adoption of the network for transaction processing.\n\nIn solving this scalability challenge, the Lightning Network which is a \u201csecond-layer solution\u201d was built separately on top of the Bitcoin network, but still interacts with it\u2026 and by skirting the main Bitcoin blockchain, it helps to speed up transaction process while reducing cost\n\nThe Lightning Network works in a manner which is similar to other layer 1 blockchain networks such as MATIC, fantom, zetrix and several others which utilize the Proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to process transactions\u2026 resulting in very high speed and low cost.\n\nNow, with the Innovative Lightning network fully available and functional, could this be the much needed fix to bitcoin' scalability challenge?",

You're not voting on anything using your \"stake\". You can't force anyone to do anything with your \"stake\". You're just committing funds, period. You don't even \"prove\" it to parties other than your *direct* counterparties.\n\n> But it's definitely a system that moves money based on stake - and nothing else.\n\nNo. Not \"nothing else\". LN must run on top of an existing consensus network. If it were based on \"nothing\" but \"stake\", then big LN nodes could cooperate to steal funds, but they can't. Why can't they? Does it have something to do with \"stake\"?\n\nThis is even more misleading than calling PoW a form of PoS (of electricity and ASICs). At least that's somewhat comprehensible, even if it's boneheaded. This is boneheaded *and* incomprehensible.",

I know using lightning network sucks but hey there are other software that sucks too, therefore it must be acceptable.\"\n\nNo, I don't accept that. That's why I use Bitcoin Cash.

Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.\n\nThe bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.\n\nIf the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal. \"\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto Sun, 02 Nov 2008",

So relying on everyone but large data centers running SPV is an immediately failure of minimizing trust.\n\nWhoops.\n\nYes, I'm saying I know more about how bitcoin works than Satoshi did in 2008, because 1) bitcoin has changed significantly since then and 2) we've learned a lot about how it actually works *in practice* that Satoshi couldn't have possibly known.\n\nRemember, Satoshi thought that mining and validating would always be the same thing.

People like saving time and money.\n\nIn all the years this sub has been around, not once has anyone demonstrated it saving time or money for anyone. Sure, you show an on-chain purchase where a merchant receives the payment using a third party custodial app. \"Wow! So easy! So Fast! So cheap!\".... What you guys refuse to show or even acknowledge is every other part of the process, like buying the crypto in the first place, or buying it for \u201cspend and replace\u201d, or the part where the merchant exchanges the crypto for the fiat that their business depends on, and what that process is like in terms of cost and time. Oh and then of course there are the tax implications.\n\nThe reality is that the world is full of plenty of smart people, and people involved in crypto are IMO, on average, smarter than most people. Plenty of them have tried the process of spending crypto on retail goods and services and realized how fucking retarded it is for so many reasons, non of which have to do with on chain fees.\n\nLastly, spending money is not a problem 99% of the world has. And the solutions that have achieved that can be easily replicated with crypto. There is no reason we won't be bale to simply select BTC over dollars in the checkout lane when we swipe our credit or debit cards, or use apple pay, venmo, paypal or anything else we currently use. There is zero practical reason it needs to be a dramatically different process for crypto.\n\nI predict LN will never grow in adoption significantly because it is overengineered and overcomplicated for the very few use cases it makes sense for.

The best way I've found to get people to actually pay in crypto is simply by having in demand products and offering decent 15% discount for crypto purchases, you be surprised how many people will go to the effort for a lower price. I've been accepting crypto on webstores since 2011 now, don't use any third party payment processors for any coin, the checkout process now days is simple, fluid and just as fast as paying with CC if a user has a mobile wallet with a QR reader, or is on PC with a desktop wallet so they can copy and paste the address.\n\nWith BTC/LN my issue is the attitude in the communities to never spend it etc.. the people in charge of the larger BTC communities could easily push the peer to peer cash use case a lot more but they don't at all. Until 2017 I only accepted BTC, so it was 100% of my crypto income, now days it's around 5% at most, even with a LN option. The most used coins in 2022 are BCH and LTC by far, followed by XMR, and a few others, even DOGE is spent more than BTC with me now. I only keep BTC as an option because I'm stubborn.\n\nWhat's the point of promoting LN to users but not promoting the actual use of it..\n\nLook how many people there are in the crypto space though, millions and millions, if they stopped thinking about how much the next person will pay in fiat for their crypto and started accepting it on their webstores, at their businesses, and people who don't have business started supporting those who do by going to the effort of using it with them and seeking out those who do accept it, it will become a more popular payment method much faster, people will eventually start asking other stores \"why don't you accept crypto?\", other business owners will see it widely accepted and start thinking about adding it as a payment option. The effort needs to come first from people who are actually into crypto already.\n\nBut yes I agree, LN is not going to do well at all, in all honesty I only added it to play devils advocate, I knew people would rarely use it, but can at least say I accept it, because otherwise when I tell people that hardly anybody pays with BTC any more, they will not be able to do the old \"BuT HaVE YoU HeArD Of LiGhTnInG!111??\" bullshit. BTC has gone backwards and been set back by many years for the peer to peer cash use case, at one point we had people like Steam, Microsoft, and Stripe onboard, massive companies that actually have a lot of customers. BTC devs and the new wave of \"investors\" set retail adoption back years..\n\nI told you already how it saves my customers some money, for me it allows me to save fees on third party payment processors, and a lot of money that is lost each year with chargebacks and similar from scammy type customers. Currently I pass those savings on to customers to incentivise them to spend the crypto in the first place, as I am making an effort to spread adoption and use of crypto, but if it ever did just become a widely used payment system, I could keep those savings for myself.\n\nPS: AFAIK the [bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com) register app and the mobile wallet are not custodial at all, those are the two apps you keep seeing being used in videos in this sub, correct me if I'm wrong.",

Like I said, people love saving time and/or money.\n\n>the checkout process now days is simple, fluid and just as fast as paying with CC if a user has a mobile wallet with a QR reader, or is on PC with a desktop wallet so they can copy and paste the address.\n\nYes, it really is. Not being sarcastic, I agree. It's the rest of the process and the hurdles I detailed in my last comment that are the problem. 15% discounts will still motivate them past that. Of course, expecting merchants to take 15% less is gonna be a high expectation.\n\n>With BTC/LN my issue is the attitude in the communities to never spend it etc.. the people in charge of the larger BTC communities could easily push the peer to peer cash use case a lot more but they don't at all.\n\nPeople don't need to push anything. It's not my job or your job or anyone elses to push anything. If a solution is the most practical solution for any application, then it will be used as a solution for that application, period.\n\nI like paying less taxes. So I almost always hold any crypto I buy for a year or longer to lessen the tax hit if I do sell it. I also have no problem spending money and would rather spend my inflationary fiat than my deflationary crypto. Does that make me have an agenda? Am I supposed to actively convince people to do something I personally find to be extremely impractical and would never do myself.\n\n>Look how many people there are in the crypto space though, millions and millions, if they stopped thinking about how much the next person will pay in fiat for their crypto and started accepting it on their webstores, at their businesses, and people who don't have business started supporting those who do by going to the effort of using it with them and seeking out those who do accept it, it will become a more popular payment method much faster, people will eventually start asking other stores \"why don't you accept crypto?\", other business owners will see it widely accepted and start thinking about adding it as a payment option. The effort needs to come first from people who are actually into crypto already.\n\nI disagree with all of this. Again, it the solution offers a competitive edge, it won't need agenda pushers.\n\nI don't need to force a square peg into a round hole. I don't need to be convincing others to do that either.\n\n>I told you already how it saves my customers some money\n\nBecause you offer a 15% discount.... This is a rarity and you are making a personal sacrifice. You are not however demonstrating crypto practicality as a payment solution.\n\n>AFAIK the bitcoin.com register app and the mobile wallet are not custodial at all, those are the two apps you keep seeing being used in videos in this sub, correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nThat's good. I'm glad bitcoin.com is promoting a non-custodial payment solution. Unfortunately that doesn't address most of the other hurdles.",

I'm not out here trying to pretend there is a big payments problem in the world and that crypto solves it. I've made enough retail crypto transactions to realize the absurdly inefficiency of it in both time and cost. Sure, I'd love to be able to spend it instead of exchanging it for fiat at times, and I'd love others to be able to do the same. This won't happen until my government recognizes it as currency and not a commodity. It won't happen until that crypto is stable enough in value that I don't have to worry about timing when I spend it. \n\nForcing crypto as a retail payment solution right now is like trying to force people to put square tires on their car. Go for it if you want. Don't shame me cause I won't push that bullshit and don't expect others to either.",

None of these people have issues actually buying crypto, and the volatility issue will never be fixed until there are more retail transaction and less speculative ones.. TBH it's fucked, it's pointless to even try and and push it to these people and communities, which is why we are here with the BCH fork, trying to do it right this time and carry on where it went wrong in 2017.\n\nMy initial comment here was just a dig at the BTC community and the people who push LN but don't push the actual use of it and spending of BTC via LN.\n\nThere isn't even an easy solution for merchant to add it without using third party payment processors, they need to spin up a linux server. I'm quite a technical person, but most merchants are not, they will be using a simple store like Woocommerce or similar on shared hosting, which is the type of thing BCH (and other coins that work well on chain) is easy to add to with a simple plugin and no need for third party payment processors.\n\nFor me, my best bet is probably to let go of any hopes anything will change with the BTC community or attitude and just put my time and effort into projects like BCH/XMR now days, but it was hard to let go after over half a decade of pushing for BTC to be used as peer to peer cash and having it screwed over and basically hijacked in the end.\n\nPeople like Steam adding it as an option was a big step, yet refusing to scale on chain made people like that drop it completely and burned a big bridge with many.\n\nIt's sad that people stopped promoting it all as magic internet money, and started promoting it as a get rich scheme, that's where it all went wrong IMHO.\n\nThe people pishing LN as a solution, are the ones that created the problem.\n\nYou are basically saying, even though most people did advocate for BTC as peer to peer cash, when it was actually more practical, now we shouldn't bother because it has been made impractical. This is more a BTC problem TBH, not a BCH, XMR, LTC, DASH etc.. problem. The narrative was completely changed and impractical is the result.\n\nYou're not interested in advocating for it's intended use, got it.\n\nHave a nice night dude.",

It was impractical for all the retail transactions I did in 2013-2015 as well. On-chain fees are the easiest problem in the world to overcome: second layers and centralized solutions.\n\nI don't get hung up on the past and why the current time is different. Not on this subject, or any, crypto or otherwise. Why the hell would I be trying to change the past? It already happened.\n\nI've said it on this sub a million times before and I'll say it again: When BCH or any other crypto saves people time or money as a retail solution, consumers and merchants alike will flock to it as a solution. Unfortunately, most BCHers are so hung up on the past like you and so tunnel-visioned about on-chain fees and what people are or aren't pushing that they refuse to address and of the actual hurdles I have listed.\n\nHave a nice night my dude.

He was saying people are just getting it from BCH ATMs when they need it so it is easy for them to get, and they are just getting the amount they need for spending so the volatility is not a major issue.\n\nMaybe I initially found it more useful than others here in the UK as I've often sold high risk products early on where they either were not allowed by some payment processors or CC merchant account providers who would allow certain products, classed them as high risk and demanded not only high fees, but also a reserve to be held. Which in turn was useful (though still complicated) for my customers at times. TBH nothing I sell now really needs crypto as such, as payment processors are now okay with things like CBD products for example, where they weren't initially.. I can even sell them on eBay now days, but when the industry was new, I needed crypto to sell them initially. I guess I just want to carry on the peer to peer cash cause regardless of if I need it to sell high risk products now days, but mostly now due to the issues I am caused with chargebacks and similar with other payment methods, I lose a lot of money due to this type of thing each year from fiat customers.\n\nI just get annoyed that now all most people care about with crypto is the price going up and the fact all they are doing is buying it, promoting it as a get rich scheme, so more people come, pump the price, allowing them to cash out for a profit and leave the promoting to the next wave of investors so they can make a profit. I feel this makes the whole crypto space look bad to normal people and like a ponzi scheme, and that bad look effects our efforts with coins like BCH and XMR as well.\n\nI also don't think 2nd layers and centralised solution are a good option.\n\nExcluding the volatility issue, I feel most hurdles now have been created by the people treating it like an asset, and in turn governments seeing this and obviously classing it as an asset as that is how they see the majority of people using it.\n\nNow that has caused tax hurdles, and more issues for people trying to buy it.\n\nHonestly I wish the price never went up so much it never attracted so many people not interested in it's intended use case, and started getting sold to people as an asset instead. I feel it has and will slow down adoption in places were it is not needed as much, just as we started getting somewhere, with Steam and Microsoft being the best examples.\n\nRight I really need to stop typing now, it's gone 2am here. I won't lie I did get frustrated at points in this discussion, but overall it was a good chat.\n\nIf you reply again I will reply in about 8-10 hours.\n\nGood night.",

The challenge of overcoming the huge hurdles of creating a functioning L2 network without any bugs or incentive issues is only Step 1, Step 2 is making it easy to use for the masses. A lot of work has been done for this on Bitcoin, and although its not perfect, its a beautiful solution in theory and is arguably like 90% to where it needs to be in reality.\n\nThe end goal of Lightning on Bitcoin should be getting people to use it without having to make any onchain payments. This means Lightning cold storage, which i believe isnt fully fleshed out yet.\n\nLightning is a beautiful solution to a L2 network because its a noncustodial L2 backed by the full security of onchain Bitcoin, and its security comes from the fact that if anyone tries to steal or interfere with your funds, you can just close your channel and get your money back. Most people arent malicious attackers, and malicious attackers dont get anything from attacking, so thats why it works.\n\nOne of the bigger hurdles to adoption of Lightning is how difficult it is to manage your own channels and liquidity. This is why semi-trusted solutions exist (dont worry, your funds are still noncustodial). This will accelerate Lightning adoption.\n\nLightning is the perfect solution for Bitcoin in its current state. It does have some major problems though, like lack of privacy, but so does Bitcoin itself.",
