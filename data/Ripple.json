Incentives usually end up benefiting those with more money who can either stake more or purchase more hardware to wield a greater degree of control over the network and perversely increase centralisation. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain in a Reddit post, but do look up the details on XRPL.org or catch up with Matt Hamilton on Twitter (@hammertoe)",

He even foreshadowed it was coming.\n\nAnd when you look at how he exchanges with Brad in 2019 @ Davos, you can tell by his body language how uncomfortable he is sitting at a panel with Brad Garlinghouse.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzgTTsOOk04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzgTTsOOk04)\n\nThey have a few exchange of words but there is a moment I'd like to point out that many of you probably didn't see before but some of us know about.\n\n**@ 27:40 mark:**\n\n**Lubin:** So, XRP is a value token and it trades in an open market. If the CFTC noticed you own 60% of the silver supply, how comfortable would they be?\n\n**Brad:** I won't speak for the CFTC. We have in escrow 55% of all XRP that we own. We can't sell it. We can't do anything with it. So we actually only own 13%...\n\n**Lubin Interrupts:** But you do sell it regularly? Don't you sell it into the market?\n\n**Brad:** We're very transparent about that. How much do you sell?\n\n**Lubin:** Um...when necessary...\n\n**Brad Interrupts:** Transparency in this market(?) is critical. Look I'm talking about transparency because the whole industry to mature we need to be transparent in the industry. Ripple, I think, has tried to lead by example with that I think there are other ecosystems that I have no idea what is going on in those ecosystems. I don't think that's good for the whole industry and I think that's bad for Ripple, too.\n\n**Later on @ 31:07:**\n\n**Robert Hackett (Moderator):** Joe, it's been said you are one of the biggest ETH holders. How do you go about managing your treasury within consensus and your own personal one?\n\n**Lubin:** \\[Laughs\\] I guess no comment. We personally in terms of consensus we're a small fraction of the ETH asset and all the assets on the ETH platform and we manage our treasury like a company would manage a treasury.\n\n**Brad:** The only interjection I have here is, I find it interesting that Ripple is attacked for being transparent because we are very proactive; in fact the next XRP market report is coming out next week, but because we share that information we are attacked for it. Yet - other platforms don't share that information so they are insulated from the same critiques and criticisms. **I think in the dictionary that is called hypocrisy.**",

You can certainly expect an official announcement from us with a timeline of events as soon as possible. This will lay out our exact plans for distribution.   \nJust let us know if there is anything else we can assist you with in the meantime : )  \nSincerely,  \nAnthony Armstrong  \nBTC Markets Pty Ltd",

This coming Tuesday is the deadline for the SEC to turn over to Judge Netburn all of the communications that they\u2019ve been trying to withhold. She will privately review them and than make determinations regarding the SEC\u2019s privilege claims (SEC is trying to withhold pretty much everything). What will she see? Did the SEC have discussions with/about Jed? Did Jed supply the SEC with confidential and/or privileged info obtained during his time with Ripple? Does Jed know what the SEC has been fighting so desperately to withhold? Does he know that this case is over once those documents get tuned over to Judge Netburn? Maybe he knows that what\u2019s in there is so damaging that the SEC will never submit the documents. They\u2019ll either settle before Tuesday, or just withhold them with the understanding that Judge Netburn will probably dismiss the case, and they can blame the judge for the loss? Which might explain why they\u2019re suddenly going after Uniswap and Coinbase, and probably a bunch of others, to try to rack up wins to compensate for this disaster. I think they tried to run out the clock, knowing that after fact discovery ended on the 31st they\u2019d be home free, hoping Judge Netburn would let them slide, but their bluff got called.

Here's why:\n\n* BTC finally broke above and closed the weekly candle above the 0.618 fib (\\~ $51k). 50k has been a stubborn resistance, and it's nice to see it close above. Next up is the 0.702 $ around $54k\n* Several altcoins are setting new ATHs in the last week, including Solana and Cardano\n* ETH closed it's weekly candle at almost $4k; this is the same level as the highest weekly candle back in May. It's back at almost 90 % of it's previous ATH\n* XRP has historically been late to go parabolic; in both 2013 and 2017/2018 we were the ones finishing off the bull season. After a nice start to August, we've been ranging sideways for a few weeks, but last week we closed above $1.30 which has been a resistance for us the last few weeks. In fact, it's our highest weekly candle since mid-May. Next hurdle is at 1.41 (0.618) and the infamous .702 is at 1.54\n* SEC-case has had some interesting developments in the last few weeks; a lot of pudits are speculating that it'll be settled and if so, that a settlement might be coming in mid September. Who knows; but it might affect the price\n\nHope you have a good start to your week, and fingers crossed that we are finally off to the moon.  \n\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

Probably in stages: from the news itself, exchanges resuming XRP trading, institutional investors returning, Ripple partners returning/ new ones starting, corporations investing in XRP, corporations using XRP and Ripple announcing an IPO. XRP will also have unique legal clarity in the US, which will make it a less risky investment compared to others (especially if the SEC starts blasting away at crypto projects), which is a big deal for institutional investors in particular.",

ETH nor BTC were never added to that same list. No reasoning provided.\n\nTrading before 2018 was a free for all. Trading in ETH and BTC beyond 2018 (including after the Hinman Speech) is highly likely. That's what the SEC are trying to hide. If Hinman or Clayton (or anyone in the chain of 64-odd people who handled/edited Hinman's speech) held ETH... it's game over.\n\nAlso brings into question... that if the SEC employees could trade XRP before 2018... how can the SEC only now say that others (including Ripple founders) couldn't because it was supposedly a security that whole time (even before the SEC told their own staff)!\n\nLet alone that they never told anyone else... and still refuse to answer any questions in the matter such as \"is ETH a security?\"\n\nUnder what reasoning was XRP added to a no-trade list in 2018... yet ETH wasn't? How is that clarity? What else is on that list?",

What form the outcome will look like and how long this will take is anyone's guess though. The SEC will try to drag it and drag it and drag it out to force Ripple into some form of settlement (that's their MO because then they can say they \"won\").\n\nEven if Ripple have to pay some $$$ amount for early XRP sales - the outcome for current and future XRP will be bright. The big problem is that the SEC have now been branded as incompetent and corrupt - with substantial evidence to back those claims available. You can't put a price on that damage. Gensler's reputation is now equally tarnished as he's being seen to fuel the fire and make things worse rather than step in from Clayton and lead the commission. \n\nThere are now influential billionaires (Mark Cuban) and politicians calling on the SEC and Gensler to pull their heads in and get their house in order. The \"court\" of public opinion has adjourned!\n\nLet the shit-show continue though...\n\n <insert popcorn eating meme>",

Regarding the outcome, it is obvious that in a fair judgement the SEC stands zero chance to succeed. The amount of accumulated evidence that there is no case is just overwhelming, and that is an understatement. I am still worried though about excessive political being exercised on the judge though. There is so much at stake.\n\n. Reputational damage...hmmm. First, this legal fight has not made it to the very big headlines of the non financial mainstream media. Second, it is as if you ask Al Capone if he cares about the mafia's reputation: he can't care less as long as he has the police department in his pocket. So far, in spite of growing evidence of corruption at the highest levels of the commission, the SEC has been given so much free hands by whoever is supposed to supervise them that I cannot imagine there is not some sort of collusion\n\n. I agree with you that Gensler let the opportunity go to whistle the end of the game and tell the World he is not part of this shit show. Instead, he endorsed fully the role of big orchestrator, and will have to bear personally the consequences of the outcome\n\n. The only real card the SEC has left in its sleeve is as you suggest time. Ripple and XRP holders are losing every day some competitive advantage, and as unfair as it is, the SEC knows this very well how damaging this can be and are trying to push this way some settlement which will somehow save what can still be saved",

Makes you realise how much work truly goes into the case (and that a smaller outfit without such deep pockets would struggle).",

Tranglo is now empowered to grant true seamless global payments to millions of people and businesses by routing mass payouts and instant transactions through its local supporting infrastructure.\n\nSome of the payment corridors immediately enhanced with the new functions are the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore. Real-time payments are now fully unlocked for these countries, while full e-wallet functions are now available for the top corridors of Philippines, Indonesia and Pakistan.

He also makes it known that the market needs clarity... and that the SEC is handling things.\n\nWind forward 30-odd months and Gensler is now the current Chair of the SEC. He refuses to answer questions put by Senators about the security status of ETH or their ICO. He now suddenly claims that there has been sufficient clarity all along.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nHe's not handling things!",

He even foreshadowed it was coming.\n\nAnd when you look at how he exchanges with Brad in 2019 @ Davos, you can tell by his body language how uncomfortable he is sitting at a panel with Brad Garlinghouse.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzgTTsOOk04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzgTTsOOk04)\n\nThey have a few exchange of words but there is a moment I'd like to point out that many of you probably didn't see before but some of us know about.\n\n**@ 27:40 mark:**\n\n**Lubin:** So, XRP is a value token and it trades in an open market. If the CFTC noticed you own 60% of the silver supply, how comfortable would they be?\n\n**Brad:** I won't speak for the CFTC. We have in escrow 55% of all XRP that we own. We can't sell it. We can't do anything with it. So we actually only own 13%...\n\n**Lubin Interrupts:** But you do sell it regularly? Don't you sell it into the market?\n\n**Brad:** We're very transparent about that. How much do you sell?\n\n**Lubin:** Um...when necessary...\n\n**Brad Interrupts:** Transparency in this market(?) is critical. Look I'm talking about transparency because the whole industry to mature we need to be transparent in the industry. Ripple, I think, has tried to lead by example with that I think there are other ecosystems that I have no idea what is going on in those ecosystems. I don't think that's good for the whole industry and I think that's bad for Ripple, too.\n\n**Later on @ 31:07:**\n\n**Robert Hackett (Moderator):** Joe, it's been said you are one of the biggest ETH holders. How do you go about managing your treasury within consensus and your own personal one?\n\n**Lubin:** \\[Laughs\\] I guess no comment. We personally in terms of consensus we're a small fraction of the ETH asset and all the assets on the ETH platform and we manage our treasury like a company would manage a treasury.\n\n**Brad:** The only interjection I have here is, I find it interesting that Ripple is attacked for being transparent because we are very proactive; in fact the next XRP market report is coming out next week, but because we share that information we are attacked for it. Yet - other platforms don't share that information so they are insulated from the same critiques and criticisms. **I think in the dictionary that is called hypocrisy.**",

You can certainly expect an official announcement from us with a timeline of events as soon as possible. This will lay out our exact plans for distribution.   \nJust let us know if there is anything else we can assist you with in the meantime : )  \nSincerely,  \nAnthony Armstrong  \nBTC Markets Pty Ltd",

I'm not tech savvy.  Computers were identified by a 3 digit number when I was in school. I am tech savvy enough to see the potential in crypto and purchased some. Last fall I wasn't comfortable moving it from an exchange. When the answer to not getting 10s of thousands of dollars I would have because I wasn't \"promised\" that airdrop is legitimately a valid grievance.\nDidn't downvote you, you led with unpopular. $436.14 is probably close to what I have paid CB in fees this year alone.

Here's why:\n\n* BTC finally broke above and closed the weekly candle above the 0.618 fib (\\~ $51k). 50k has been a stubborn resistance, and it's nice to see it close above. Next up is the 0.702 $ around $54k\n* Several altcoins are setting new ATHs in the last week, including Solana and Cardano\n* ETH closed it's weekly candle at almost $4k; this is the same level as the highest weekly candle back in May. It's back at almost 90 % of it's previous ATH\n* XRP has historically been late to go parabolic; in both 2013 and 2017/2018 we were the ones finishing off the bull season. After a nice start to August, we've been ranging sideways for a few weeks, but last week we closed above $1.30 which has been a resistance for us the last few weeks. In fact, it's our highest weekly candle since mid-May. Next hurdle is at 1.41 (0.618) and the infamous .702 is at 1.54\n* SEC-case has had some interesting developments in the last few weeks; a lot of pudits are speculating that it'll be settled and if so, that a settlement might be coming in mid September. Who knows; but it might affect the price\n\nHope you have a good start to your week, and fingers crossed that we are finally off to the moon.  \n\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

Probably in stages: from the news itself, exchanges resuming XRP trading, institutional investors returning, Ripple partners returning/ new ones starting, corporations investing in XRP, corporations using XRP and Ripple announcing an IPO. XRP will also have unique legal clarity in the US, which will make it a less risky investment compared to others (especially if the SEC starts blasting away at crypto projects), which is a big deal for institutional investors in particular.",

What form the outcome will look like and how long this will take is anyone's guess though. The SEC will try to drag it and drag it and drag it out to force Ripple into some form of settlement (that's their MO because then they can say they \"won\").\n\nEven if Ripple have to pay some $$$ amount for early XRP sales - the outcome for current and future XRP will be bright. The big problem is that the SEC have now been branded as incompetent and corrupt - with substantial evidence to back those claims available. You can't put a price on that damage. Gensler's reputation is now equally tarnished as he's being seen to fuel the fire and make things worse rather than step in from Clayton and lead the commission. \n\nThere are now influential billionaires (Mark Cuban) and politicians calling on the SEC and Gensler to pull their heads in and get their house in order.

Regarding the outcome, it is obvious that in a fair judgement the SEC stands zero chance to succeed. The amount of accumulated evidence that there is no case is just overwhelming, and that is an understatement. I am still worried though about excessive political being exercised on the judge though. There is so much at stake.\n\n. Reputational damage...hmmm. First, this legal fight has not made it to the very big headlines of the non financial mainstream media. Second, it is as if you ask Al Capone if he cares about the mafia's reputation: he can't care less as long as he has the police department in his pocket. So far, in spite of growing evidence of corruption at the highest levels of the commission, the SEC has been given so much free hands by whoever is supposed to supervise them that I cannot imagine there is not some sort of collusion\n\n. I agree with you that Gensler let the opportunity go to whistle the end of the game and tell the World he is not part of this shit show. Instead, he endorsed fully the role of big orchestrator, and will have to bear personally the consequences of the outcome\n\n. The only real card the SEC has left in its sleeve is as you suggest time. Ripple and XRP holders are losing every day some competitive advantage, and as unfair as it is, the SEC knows this very well how damaging this can be and are trying to push this way some settlement which will somehow save what can still be saved",

Makes you realise how much work truly goes into the case (and that a smaller outfit without such deep pockets would struggle).",

News from Tranglo (Ripple owns 40%). \n\n\"Tranglo Pte Ltd has announced that it received new approvals from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) under the Payment Services Act (PSA) to provide account issuance, domestic money transfer and e-money issuance services.\n\nThe PSA, passed by the Singaporean Parliament on 14 January 2019, provides for regulatory certainty and consumer safeguards, while encouraging innovation and growth of payment services and fintech. Licence holders are held to high standards and must comply with anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing regulations.\n\nThe licence to perform the additional services are a boost to the rapidly expanding capabilities of Tranglo\u2019s cross-border payment network, fully regulated by 4 authorities and covers over 22 countries. Tranglo is now empowered to grant true seamless global payments to millions of people and businesses by routing mass payouts and instant transactions through its local supporting infrastructure.\n\nSome of the payment corridors immediately enhanced with the new functions are the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore. Real-time payments are now fully unlocked for these countries, while full e-wallet functions are now available for the top corridors of Philippines, Indonesia and Pakistan. More upgrades are in the pipeline.\"",

Anja asked a nice little trick question, to which he answered the ONLY way he can: \"there is clarity\". So well done him. If he deviated away from that answer then it is game over for his crypto ambitions. Already two commissioners have said the complete opposite.\n\nIMO it is that tight of a gamble he and the SEC are playing with. If fair notice defence holds and makes it a win for Ripple, Gensler loses whole of crypto.\n\nQuestion is, how big of a gambler is he?",

Case in point, SEC submits a SWORN AFFIDAVIT from Hinman in support of his contention that the Ethereum \u201cfree pass speech\u201d was just his opinion. Than they later argue that the speech reflects the position of the SEC\u2019s Corporate Finance Division (which Hinman led), was meant to provide \u201cmarket guidance, and again support this contention with a SWORN AFFIDAVIT. A complete contradiction of their earlier claim. They are blatantly lying to the court, making a mockery of our judicial system and destroying the credibility of the SEC. Why?? The same reason that Clayton, Hinman and others left the SEC IMMEDIATELY after bringing the action against Ripple, and they all took jobs in the crypto industry, not coincidentally with Ethereum affiliated entities, knowing full well how unethical it would appear. The reason is that the amount of money at stake is so enormous that they are willing to sacrifice everything, their reputations, the integrity of our institutions, everything for a stake in this once in lifetime, multi generational wealth creating opportunity. So those are the stakes. For the winners, and by all accounts Ripple is winning this court case, granted not fast enough for our liking, but they are winning, the prize is wealth beyond your wildest imagination. And more importantly the freedom to live your life on your own terms, beholden to no man. Can you hold out for another month? Another year? I damn sure can. They\u2019ll never break me. They\u2019ll have to pry my XRP from my cold dying hand!",

Jesse Powell is in the first one and Chris Larsen is in the second, but Jed is a recipient of both. The first one essentially says that what Ripple is offering is a security, at which point Ripple revised their business plan and went back to the firm and the firm concluded that now it was NOT a security. I always wondered how the SEC got their hands on these legal memos which one would think would be protected by attorney client privilege\u2026unless a member of the team waived the privilege. Did Jed waive the privilege, and turn over the FIRST memo to the SEC, but not the SECOND memo, leading the SEC to mistakenly believe that Ripple had gone against the advise of their lawyers and sold an unregistered security??? \ud83e\udd14\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/filanlaw/status/1494821377701986304",

It unearthed this mysterious market from what felt like right underneath me. Within 2 days I had done enough research to be convinced to get myself into XRP. \n\nMuch has changed since then. My attitude is more grounded and mature from \"moonboi\" to factual and intelligent conversations (although I still love cracking jokes). The crypto space has matured as well as it crawls its way into solving real-world problems. There is still a long road ahead, but the horizon is showing that blockchain will be part of our futures. Whatever crypto coin you hold, there is a little voice in the back of your head telling you that the crypto space is conforming into *something*. Oh, and to hodl, of course.\n\nI'm grateful that I'm here in this fucked up space with you fine lads. The short term looks dreary with the SEC lawsuit but Ripple hasn't skipped a beat executing it's objectives globally. Every country has their own set of rules/laws/regulations and there isn't a single other business remotely close to the global scale that Ripple has. They are playing chess with SWIFT and their pieces seem very well placed. \n\nI'll be damned if I had to look back at myself and wonder why I didn't hodl any XRP.",

I think you are taking this a little to personal by reading some of the comments you made. Sometimes things like this need to happen for the bigger picture of moving forward. Look at it from this perspective XRP has been around for many years and has always been a speculation coin of what its use case can do and now it has the chance to have clairty and move forward.. Without the SEC/Ripple lawsuit it for certain would have still been awating clairty for who knows how many years.\n\nDo you want a  $5.00 speculated price and hope to sell at the top or would you rather have clairtiy and real use with a stable price that can incrase for years to come?",

Look, nobody knows how the SEC case will play out, but we\u2019ll have a pretty good idea within the next few days when a Judge Torres rules on the fair notice defense motion. If the SEC\u2019s position is weakened and they\u2019re forced to settle or drop the case (or lose the case at summary judgement), the upside for XRP\u2019s price will be INSANE. In fact, I think what we\u2019re seeing rt now is the market pricing in an SEC loss or settlement. If you have a little money you can afford lose, why not throw a cpl grand in? If the SEC wins you lose a cpl grand, but if they lose, the cpl grand turn into a 5 or 6 figure payday. Where else are you gonna get that kind of return on investment?

If the SEC are basing their arguments for significant prong tests of Howey on an internal email from Brad to staff and an email from Chris to an international XRP buyer.... then they're in trouble.\n\nThe general consensus was \"that's what the SEC fought to get submitted!!!\"... as in \"that's all they've got?\"",

I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re hearing all of this talk abt an executive order to try and bail them out. But that won\u2019t work. Imagine they try to say that all crypto are securities, and than they get bogged down in legal challenges abt the constitutionality of the order. Meanwhile Ethereum, their preferred crypto, gets labeled a security too, because they\u2019ve sworn under oath that the \u201cfree pass\u201d was just Hinman\u2019s opinion. So the playing field is leveled because all crypto is dead in the US, including Ethereum, and the rest of the world moves forward using Ripple who\u2019ve been quietly building their overseas business the whole time. That ain\u2019t gonna happen. I think the backup plan is to go after the exchanges. That way they can pick winners and losers by making the exchanges register and than telling them which cryptos they can or can\u2019t list. But that ain\u2019t gonna work either because decentralized exchanges will continue to thrive. The SEC screwed the pooch on this one",

I would have to totally agree with him.Many people are quite fooled in this space just throwing fiat into anything in hopes of making a buck and never even consider every project/idea is starting out as a funding project in big hopes of a use case. It has become so routine to think of a use case and test the waters and if it slightly works more projects will do the same in following suit to get their fair share of funding.\n\nRipple/XRP i will say actually has put forth a massive amount of effort and time over the years to position itself with a very good usecase and has kept true to its original plan. Sure they made changes thruout the years but still have the original use case End Goal in mind. There are also a few other older platforms/projects that have stayed laser focused as well with their original plans.\n\nWhat i don't like seeing is all this new type of trying to be creative on existing platforms trying to sell a use case when its all nothing more then disguised fundraising tactics. I'm saying all this because of whats happening on XRP/xrpl as well as other platforms getting ruined by these tactics. This gives Goverments or any other authority (SEC) reason to come in swinging the way they have reguarding. regulations. \n\nCZ's tweet.\n\n(Yield farming, transaction mining, airdrops are decent ways to jump start a project (attract an initial user base), but you still need to build real use cases. Otherwise, the project won't be sustainable in the long run.)",

Right now there is a chance to have all the boxes checked to give XRP the green lite to success and it would not have happened as quickly if the SEC helping move things along more quickly which is what everyone wants..",

I agree that this has sped things up to get clarity but I'm appalled by the corruption that has brought this case to fruition. Why else would the SEC try to go against a private company with enough equity and resources to offer a real fight? We all know Ripple's legal team is impressive - but their core arguments against the SEC are pretty basic and the answers should be clear.\n\nThe fact that the SEC is tripping over their own words while providing vague and inconsistent remarks regarding their point of view on crypto currencies is unacceptable. This is your job, yet Gensler can't answer any questions.\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous. The whole thing just irritates me. \n\nI'm buying more xrp.",

They have a very successful application  that speeds up international remittances and messaging. \n2. XRP is a cryptocurrency. Ripple holds about 55% of the supply, set to release a billion coins a month. They sell the coins to large scale partners, but a lot of them (seems like 70% over the past few months) get locked up after a month. \n3. Ripple would like banks to use XRP in conjunction with their software, banks can basically go into the settings and turn on \"use XRP\".\n\nOther fun facts:\n-XRP is not a BTC or ETH clone, it's a totally different chain and model. XRP is not mined. There are 100 billion coins. Since there's no mining, validators are just approving transactions every 3-4 seconds using a consensus model. TPS is theoretically 70k per chain, and side chains can be added for another 70k each. Real life stats were about 18k TPS I believe. \n\n-anyone can run a validator node, but because theres no incentive like mining, mostly universities, banks, governments are running validators. To approve a change to the ledger you need 80% of the validators to agree. Ripple currently runs 15% of the validators, so they don't even have enough say to \"veto\" a change.",

SBI likes them so much they came to some kind of franchise/parternship agreement for east Asia. Check out their career page and you'll see they have physical offices all over the world. \n\n2-Certifications. Ripple is ISO and several other acronym accredited. They're audited, they've made changes in 2015ish to be in line with banking standards. \n\n3-Network effect. If you check out the affidavit that Moneygram submitted for the SEC lawsuit, my big take away is that the network isn't quite there yet. They need additional partners using it worldwide so that the order books can handle international remittances. Ripple has been working at this for quite a few years and still hasn't quite cracked it. I doubt a coin developed today could get enough adoption in 5 years to support this, and Ripple already has a significant head start. \n\n4-Regulatory clarity. Assuming that the SEC doesn't somehow pull victory from the jaws of defeat in their lawsuit, XRP will have an official designation as something other than a security. This should let banks who are very risk adverse \"flip the switch\". Some of the banks will already be using Ripple software, so this should be an easy sell, and hopefully solve the network effect issue.",

                    "response": ">What then prevents actors from simply dominating a particular network through a majority possession of resources\u2014whether mining resources, consensus nodes, or simply the coins/tokens themselves?\n\nWell, which network are you asking about?\n\nFor Bitcoin's and Ethereum's ledgers which use PoW systems, the barrier is hash power. Given that more than half of it is in China and all Chinese businesses need to do as the CCP says, the network's security is indeed vulnerable to political influence. \n\nNote: We can debate whether China would want to do that or what a possible motivation might be, but that conversation misses the whole point of blockchains which is that the system *shouldn't* have to rely on trusting a foreign entity to not prevent anyone's legitimate participation in the network.\n\nThe crazy thing too is, once that power takes hold, there isn't an easy way for the network to eject that influence--they would either have to find more hash power and undo many transactions or fork the network and find a way to prevent those same players from participating in the network (I'm not even sure how exactly that would be possible though).\n\nIf we're talking about XRP, it's much trickier because it's not strictly a financial or resource hurdle or barrier. Currently, most nodes on UNL lists are publicly identified as people who have been and are involved in the XRP community. We're talking about years of good faith work and development before a single node is added to that list and even then it's no guarantee they will be added to any one UNL, let alone most. Plus, there's some consideration given to geographical location of the nodes. I don't expect you'll ever see a time where a majority of nodes are sitting in one country. Realistically, once there are, say, 300-500+ validators on any UNL (let's say, current UNL nodes plus a bunch more universities and Ripple clients), there won't be much of a need for more nodes on the UNL list. What do 1,000 (where you aren't able to vet half of them so well) give you that 500 doesn't?\n\nSo, as you can imagine, getting a majority of nodes controlled by a single group of bad actors on UNLs used by a majority of participants would be very difficult and time consuming, if not entirely impossible. And even if it were to happen, these nodes have 1 shot to undermine the system after which they can pretty easily be removed from any UNLs and their influence dies. And that's your worst case scenario.\n\n>I think instead what we are seeing is not some \u201cnew democracy\u201d that will transcend the legacy of authoritarian entities but rather: 1) A digitalization of all things. And subsequent to that 2) A hyper-connectivity of all things.\n\nI wouldn't call this a new democracy, but it is a democratization of access to value. Imagine living in Venezuela right now under an authoritarian regime and insane hyperinflation. If everyone had access to their funds in a decentralized ledger beyond government control, they could mitigate some of those negative effects.\n\nA good parallel is the internet. It helped to democratize information and subvert a lot of government propoganda. Granted, some regimes have found ways to limit that, but the internet nevertheless gave more people equal access to information.\n\nDigitization and hyperconnectivity are a couple of the benefits of BC development, but they're just the tip of the iceberg IMO.",

With stocks, the amount of shares is an accurate figure and determines the distribution of who owns the company. So for stocks Market Cap is a good metric to look at. However, in cryptocurrencies we can\u2019t look at market cap to make accurate judgements because it\u2019s just the current price of the coin times the amount in circulation. The current price is based off what people are willing to pay for it, and the circulation part is also critically misunderstand. If their are 10 million in circulation, but huge investors buy 2 million and just hold onto them, and the owners of the company keep 2 million for themselves (not in escrow) then their are really only 6 million circulating and available. Theirs no way to tell how many are in dormant wallets or lost. \n\nHere\u2019s what really gets me, people make fun of the XRP community for thinking it could hit $10k per coin and say that it\u2019s impossible because of market cap. Let me break it down. Theirs a new coin that has 300 coins in circulation. Let\u2019s say that you bought 100 coins for $25, then 100 for $30, then 100 for $50 which is the current price. Wait a second... $50 price x 300 is $15000 market cap. But theirs only $10,500 in cash invested... That\u2019s because the price is driven up by what people are willing to pay, so you could have a coin with a trillion dollar market cap and it only has $1 bil in fiat \u201cinvested\u201d. Market cap isn\u2019t limited by the amount of fiat money available. The money isn\u2019t actually \u201cinvested\u201d in the sense that it\u2019s just apart of the market cap until it gets taken out. The money used to purchase the coin is now in another persons account. That person could choose to buy back more of the coin at a higher price with the same money! The money isn\u2019t locked away in the market cap pool like you think.\n\n\nEdit: just copy and pasted this, had to take the time to write out an explanation cause everyone always asks this and doesn\u2019t understand",

The Tipper is a SpigotMC server plugin that allows players to tip server owners directly in XRP in game! Additionally the XRP Tipper is integrated with the XUMM wallet so players don\u2019t have to worry about the plugin controlling their private keys. Today\u2019s launch is the v0.1.0 launch, but I have big ideas about future development. Today players can:\n\n1. Register their public address with a server\n\n2. Use the /xrptip command to send an amount of XRP to the Minecraft Server Admin\u2019s wallet.\n\nNot only am I excited about this launch, but also looking for community engagement. Many communities host Minecraft servers where like minded individuals can play together. I\u2019m on the lookout to partner with an #XRPCommunity member(s) who would be willing to sponsor and administrate a community Minecraft server. We would collaborate to use the server as a testbed for plugin development and as a working example to show other server owners. You can find all the juicy details on my plugin here as well as my website ezpzxrp.com.",

As far as leaving everything on the exchanges, that is your choice, although I wouldn't.  Maybe at least stick to Kraken/Coinbase since they are at least American companies (if you live in America).  But your going to have to monitor current events just in case of a delisting (although 99% sure that won't happen).",

I like to think I have a high tolerance for risk (which is why I put money into crypto) but if there is some serious uncertainty you have to weigh the risk you're taking.\n\nA lot of people who support XRP don't like the risk/benefit right now for ripple so their pulling money out. I myself am part of that group as I've reduced my holdings (hopefully temporarily). My hope is that things will normalize and then I'll likely look to increase my position. But still, saying shit like \"weak hands\" and \"FUD\" and claiming you're going to \"HODL\" without being wary of risk is a sure fire way to lose your money. As long as you're ok with the risks people should do what they want however.\n\nIf there ever is a firesale with ripple i'll probably dip my hands in the bloody water... but after my experience with 2017 I'm not going to be naive about this whole thing",

It seems less about Ripple and more about punishing Garlinghouse and Larson.\n\nIn my opinion, the SEC filing makes Garlinghouse and Larson seem like greedy market manipulators. It makes this assertion over and over. However, if true, while unsavory, it is not illegal and can't be the focus of the SEC case.\n\nThe idea that aligned interests between Ripple and XRP holders means common enterprise is tenuous. I didn't read anything that made it clear XRP was a security.\n\nIt has to be noted that Garlinghouse is understating the SEC case. It is also seems the SEC is trying to paint a picture that along the edges makes it appear XRP is security rather than providing actual proof that it is a security.\n\nIn short, the SEC is claiming XRP is a security because people bought it with the expectation that Ripple would be responsible for its increase in value. That may be aligned interests but not clearly common enterprise as others are also responsible for XRPs rise in value (SBI, ratings agencies, exchanges etc...).\n\nAlso, Ripple dumped on XRP holders to build Ripple, the ecosystem, and Garlinghouse and Larson enriched themselves in the process. However, the XRP use case and ecosystem has grown vis a vis their actions. As a result XRP holders saw an increase in the price of their tokens. There would have been a greater rise, if they had dumped less but also less growth in the ecosystem. I'm okay with selling XRP to grow the ecosystem (though I don't hold XRP). What will leave a bad taste for some is the dumping not designed to help the ecosystem. The dumping by Garlinghouse, Larson, and third party institutional buyers which purchased XRP at a discount to make a guaranteed profit.\n\nLast point. The best witness the SEC has is David Schwartz. This guy needs to just focus on code and stay off chat sites. He obviously helps with the development of the technology but his past comments are a buffet the SEC went over and picked what they wanted from.",
