I think I just made a comment about how it's one of the worst cryptos for virtually any purpose other than being \"a store of value.\"\n\nI think 90% of maxis fall into that category. When you're invested in something, you become *emotionally* invested.\n\nBut the *entire* reason I got involved with XRP is that it was one of the few tokens that \"made sense;\" like there is a purpose behind Ripple using it. So many other tokens are **fighting** to solve issues that don't actually exist, especially the ones that are just clones of clones. I mean how many DEX's, NFT marketplaces do we need? \n\nReally though, I'm not even knocking BTC, I just don't *get it*, other than being the first it's probably the worst token for *any* purpose and the entire market climbs or falls with it.",

These are still early days, BTCs value is derived 100% speculation, but why? It offers no utility, is terrible for transactions, and other tokens can suit the purpose of \"store of value.\" I often hear the argument that because of the high mining rates, it's \"truly\" decentralized, but they neglect the glaring fact that roughly 65% of BTC mining pools originate in China, hardly decentralized.\n\nYes, Ripple holds about 60% of the supply of XRP, but that's dwindling as more utility is brought on, more corridors are opened and more supply is released. Ripple only accounts for 6% of the validators and in fact amendments have been made that were not influenced by Ripple.\n\nI don't think BTC is going anywhere, but this tribalism is doing nothing but harming the ecosystem",

They're a two-employee holding company for a few assorted stakes in various companies: \n\n* a VOIP phone provider that hasn't picked up any new customers since 2015;\n* an MOU with PVCombank which doesn't mean anything;\n* an 18% stake in \"an online short\u00adterm P2P financing platform for SMEs in Vietnam\" which cost them $300k (half of which they paid in shares of Vemanti instead of Actual Money);\n* a stablecoin project that's been shut down after burning through over a million dollars of consulting expenses (\"As of February 22, 2022, the Company has terminated its agreements with Stably and FDT, and all USDV tokens have been burned.\"); and,\n* about eight grand worth of bitcoin. \n\nThey hold themselves out as some sort of fintech venture fund, but they also say \"we are currently not in any discussions with any parties regarding acquisitions or joint ventures\". And they haven't made a profit since 2015.\n\nAnyway, it doesn't make any sense for these guys (and remember, there's only two of them) to be working with Ripple, as a partner or a customer. None of Vemanti's businesses have any kind of need for cross-border payments. \n\n(As a side note, VMNT is worth like $50 million despite having, as best I can tell, continued losses, no prospect of paying a dividend, and no meaningful business except for the stake in Fvndit. If I was the CEO of this thing, I'd be selling as many shares as I possibly could, because the stock is *expensive.*)",

XRPLs consensus (FBA) is very different from that if Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nPhilosophically XRPL nodes are intended to be run by those who feel that they benefit from a healthy network. XRPL is against incentives (see the \u201cno incentive is the best incentive\u201d speech by David Schwartz). Incentives usually end up benefiting those with more money who can either stake more or purchase more hardware to wield a greater degree of control over the network and perversely increase centralisation. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain in a Reddit post, but do look up the details on XRPL.org or catch up with Matt Hamilton on Twitter (@hammertoe)",

The only thing SEC can do is wait for ripple to settle if not go on with the delay until settlement from ripple.  This is what is happening now, unfortunately for SEC ripple is continuing thier business outside usa so ripple is not on a hurry.  \n\nWe just hope SEC will settle instead and ask ripple to decrease its escrow or ask ripple to give a few billions in escrow to finance the SEC for chasing Eth and other crypto... which is awesome for our long term position.",

The SEC opposes on the grounds that the interrogatory is vague and ambiguous, and that it misapprehends the SEC\u2019s decision-making process, which generally does not make determinations as to specific financial instruments\u2019 status. To the extent that the SEC relies on previous unsworn admissions to respond to this interrogatory, the SEC is directed to supplement its response so that it complies with Rule 33(b)(3). The Court does not otherwise find the SEC\u2019s response evasive or incomplete; the SEC has explained to Ripple that it does not typically determine whether a particular financial instrument is or is not a security. Defendants\u2019 motion regarding Ripple Interrogatory No. 6 is GRANTED only insofar as the SEC is ordered to supplement its response to comply with Rule 33(b)(3).\u201d\n\nCan someone confirm this means we won\u2019t get an answer as to whether ETH and BTC are securities?",

So the SEC will say, UNDER OATH, (a) they have made no determination as to Ethereum\u2019s status, essentially nullifying Hinman\u2019s free pass, or (b) say that Ethereum is a security, literally nullifying Hinman\u2019s free pass, or (c) say Ethereum is not a security, in which case Ripple will say that XRP shouldn\u2019t be seen as a security either because, unlike Ethereum, Ripple never held an ICO, and the XRPL is both fully functional and more decentralized than Ethereum",

He even foreshadowed it was coming.\n\nAnd when you look at how he exchanges with Brad in 2019 @ Davos, you can tell by his body language how uncomfortable he is sitting at a panel with Brad Garlinghouse.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzgTTsOOk04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzgTTsOOk04)\n\nThey have a few exchange of words but there is a moment I'd like to point out that many of you probably didn't see before but some of us know about.\n\n**@ 27:40 mark:**\n\n**Lubin:** So, XRP is a value token and it trades in an open market. If the CFTC noticed you own 60% of the silver supply, how comfortable would they be?\n\n**Brad:** I won't speak for the CFTC. We have in escrow 55% of all XRP that we own. We can't sell it. We can't do anything with it. So we actually only own 13%...\n\n**Lubin Interrupts:** But you do sell it regularly? Don't you sell it into the market?\n\n**Brad:** We're very transparent about that. How much do you sell?\n\n**Lubin:** Um...when necessary...\n\n**Brad Interrupts:** Transparency in this market(?) is critical. Look I'm talking about transparency because the whole industry to mature we need to be transparent in the industry. Ripple, I think, has tried to lead by example with that I think there are other ecosystems that I have no idea what is going on in those ecosystems. I don't think that's good for the whole industry and I think that's bad for Ripple, too.\n\n**Later on @ 31:07:**\n\n**Robert Hackett (Moderator):** Joe, it's been said you are one of the biggest ETH holders. How do you go about managing your treasury within consensus and your own personal one?\n\n**Lubin:** \\[Laughs\\] I guess no comment. We personally in terms of consensus we're a small fraction of the ETH asset and all the assets on the ETH platform and we manage our treasury like a company would manage a treasury.\n\n**Brad:** The only interjection I have here is, I find it interesting that Ripple is attacked for being transparent because we are very proactive; in fact the next XRP market report is coming out next week, but because we share that information we are attacked for it. Yet - other platforms don't share that information so they are insulated from the same critiques and criticisms. **I think in the dictionary that is called hypocrisy.**",

With our boost towards 1,20, we took out the B-wave of the A-B-C structure that took us from 1.40 to low 0.80s. We then broke above the 0.618 retracement level from 1.40. It didn't hold on the first try, but we were not strongly rejected either. 10-12 % gains when the rest of the larger players are pretty much sitting still is a good thing. I think it'll need some consolidation at around 1.17-1.19 before it does another push. BTC has been ranging for the last three days, but has had three daily candle closes above the .702 retracement from ATH, which is very good.",

You can certainly expect an official announcement from us with a timeline of events as soon as possible. This will lay out our exact plans for distribution.   \nJust let us know if there is anything else we can assist you with in the meantime : )  \nSincerely,  \nAnthony Armstrong  \nBTC Markets Pty Ltd",

You already said that Kraken will support Flare. When Flare token will be distributed, is not my question. As you know, Songbird (SGB)is an Airdrop on the same account of my XRP. \n\n2 questions: are you going to support SGB? If not? Are you going to make a separate wallet from where I can send it to my private wallet or are you going to send it to my private wallet. The SGB is going to be send to the Kraken Wallet, but it is mine. Can you please elaborate how I can get my SGB?\n\nThank you.\n\nSincerly,",

A few of the recent airdrops have been creating custom exchange pairs on solo and I have been arbitraging a few when the opportunity arises. \n\nSologenics use case is on Hold in the US likely waiting on precedent in the Ripple Sec case. The European side will launch soon. Cant make guarantees about market behavior but Solo is very under valued. You can see it on the charts. Smart money buys the lows on good projects. People don't like solo because the dex doesn't have a lot of volumes so people scream scam but the tech works. Go make a token and a custom exchange pair, it's easy. Most don't think they are offering enough incentives to use the network but again I think this is because of the use case. They're going for the regulated market where they are responsible for creating tokenized securities. This is a platform of businesses and quick access to a interconnected dex. Potential is much greater than its currently valued. Buy an hold",

Cry baby is a bit extreme when it is an airdrop worth 30 cents a coin last I looked.  For some folks that is a hefty chunk of change we would have in our possession had we not trusted the support.  400 dollars might not be much to you but, it could be every hard earned extra scrap of money left from their budget. I'm not tech savvy.  Computers were identified by a 3 digit number when I was in school. I am tech savvy enough to see the potential in crypto and purchased some. Last fall I wasn't comfortable moving it from an exchange. When the answer to not getting 10s of thousands of dollars I would have because I wasn't \"promised\" that airdrop is legitimately a valid grievance.\nDidn't downvote you, you led with unpopular. $436.14 is probably close to what I have paid CB in fees this year alone. I am a customer.  Making us feel like you ripped us off.....actual letter of the law theft or not, it is how we feel, that is how you lose customers.",

While you can still buy the dip, it kind of defeats the purpose of DCA.   \n\n\nBear in mind something though:   \n\n\nI buy 10.000 XRP at various pricepoints, with an average cost of $0.17. I have some extra money that I want to invest, let's say I have enough to buy 2500 XRP @ 0.95. I'm worried that this will \"ruin\" my DCA. Let's consider two: scenarios.   \n\n\n**Scenario 1:**   \nI buy 10.000 XRP @  an average price of $0.17. I sell my XRP at $5   \nI buy 2500 IOTA @ 0.95, and sell them at $5. \n\n10.000 XRP bought for $1700 and sold for $50.000 means $48.300 in profits.   \n2500 IOTA bought for $2375 and sold for $12.500 means $10.125 in profits\n\nTotal profits in scenario 1: $58.425   \n\n\n**Scenario 2:**   \nI buy 10.000 XRP @  an average price of $0.17.   \nI buy 2500 XRP @ 0.95  \nMy DCA is now $0.326 (using weighted average).   \n\n\nI then sell my 12500 XRP @ $5, netting me - you guessed it - $58.425 in profits. \n\n  \nIncreasing your DCA doesn't mean you've suddenly paid more for the XRP you had prior to your last purchase. DCA is a strategy different strategy than buying the dip.",

It could be that since he\u2019s down to his last scheduled allotment of XRP he\u2019s decided to await price appreciation to maximize his final cash out at some future yet to be determined date. Or\u2026.maybe he knows that something big is about to happen. This coming Tuesday is the deadline for the SEC to turn over to Judge Netburn all of the communications that they\u2019ve been trying to withhold. She will privately review them and than make determinations regarding the SEC\u2019s privilege claims (SEC is trying to withhold pretty much everything). What will she see? Did the SEC have discussions with/about Jed? Did Jed supply the SEC with confidential and/or privileged info obtained during his time with Ripple? Does Jed know what the SEC has been fighting so desperately to withhold? Does he know that this case is over once those documents get tuned over to Judge Netburn? Maybe he knows that what\u2019s in there is so damaging that the SEC will never submit the documents. They\u2019ll either settle before Tuesday, or just withhold them with the understanding that Judge Netburn will probably dismiss the case, and they can blame the judge for the loss? Which might explain why they\u2019re suddenly going after Uniswap and Coinbase, and probably a bunch of others, to try to rack up wins to compensate for this disaster. I think they tried to run out the clock, knowing that after fact discovery ended on the 31st they\u2019d be home free, hoping Judge Netburn would let them slide, but their bluff got called. Now it\u2019s \u201cshow your cards\u201d time. I think they fold",

Here's why:\n\n* BTC finally broke above and closed the weekly candle above the 0.618 fib (\\~ $51k). 50k has been a stubborn resistance, and it's nice to see it close above. Next up is the 0.702 $ around $54k\n* Several altcoins are setting new ATHs in the last week, including Solana and Cardano\n* ETH closed it's weekly candle at almost $4k; this is the same level as the highest weekly candle back in May. It's back at almost 90 % of it's previous ATH\n* XRP has historically been late to go parabolic; in both 2013 and 2017/2018 we were the ones finishing off the bull season. After a nice start to August, we've been ranging sideways for a few weeks, but last week we closed above $1.30 which has been a resistance for us the last few weeks. In fact, it's our highest weekly candle since mid-May. Next hurdle is at 1.41 (0.618) and the infamous .702 is at 1.54\n* SEC-case has had some interesting developments in the last few weeks; a lot of pudits are speculating that it'll be settled and if so, that a settlement might be coming in mid September. Who knows; but it might affect the price\n\nHope you have a good start to your week, and fingers crossed that we are finally off to the moon.  \n\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

It would be helpful to get that extra boost from a settled case, potential clarity and last but not least, relisting.\n\nEdit: seems mid-september is an estimate based on the fact that SEC must provide unredacted copies of documents to the judge by Sept 14th. I guess the argument is that that will make the case. Not sure how realistic it is, but here's hoping :)",

Trading in ETH and BTC beyond 2018 (including after the Hinman Speech) is highly likely. That's what the SEC are trying to hide. If Hinman or Clayton (or anyone in the chain of 64-odd people who handled/edited Hinman's speech) held ETH... it's game over.\n\nAlso brings into question... that if the SEC employees could trade XRP before 2018... how can the SEC only now say that others (including Ripple founders) couldn't because it was supposedly a security that whole time (even before the SEC told their own staff)!\n\nLet alone that they never told anyone else... and still refuse to answer any questions in the matter such as \"is ETH a security?\"\n\nUnder what reasoning was XRP added to a no-trade list in 2018... yet ETH wasn't?

Ripple could include all kinds of documents that would severely damage the SEC, regardless of the outcome of the case, such as the documents the SEC has been withholding (if the judge decides they are relevant and admissible), their internal crypto trading policies and their answers regarding if ETH is or is not a security. The SEC will be extremely keen to prevent these things from getting out, making a settlement before we reach that stage seem more likely.",

What form the outcome will look like and how long this will take is anyone's guess though. The SEC will try to drag it and drag it and drag it out to force Ripple into some form of settlement (that's their MO because then they can say they \"won\").\n\nEven if Ripple have to pay some $$$ amount for early XRP sales - the outcome for current and future XRP will be bright. The big problem is that the SEC have now been branded as incompetent and corrupt - with substantial evidence to back those claims available. You can't put a price on that damage. Gensler's reputation is now equally tarnished as he's being seen to fuel the fire and make things worse rather than step in from Clayton and lead the commission. \n\nThere are now influential billionaires (Mark Cuban) and politicians calling on the SEC and Gensler to pull their heads in and get their house in order. The \"court\" of public opinion has adjourned!\n\nLet the shit-show continue though...\n\n <insert popcorn eating meme>",

Regarding the outcome, it is obvious that in a fair judgement the SEC stands zero chance to succeed. The amount of accumulated evidence that there is no case is just overwhelming, and that is an understatement. I am still worried though about excessive political being exercised on the judge though. There is so much at stake.\n\n. Reputational damage...hmmm. First, this legal fight has not made it to the very big headlines of the non financial mainstream media. Second, it is as if you ask Al Capone if he cares about the mafia's reputation: he can't care less as long as he has the police department in his pocket. So far, in spite of growing evidence of corruption at the highest levels of the commission, the SEC has been given so much free hands by whoever is supposed to supervise them that I cannot imagine there is not some sort of collusion\n\n. I agree with you that Gensler let the opportunity go to whistle the end of the game and tell the World he is not part of this shit show. Instead, he endorsed fully the role of big orchestrator, and will have to bear personally the consequences of the outcome\n\n. The only real card the SEC has left in its sleeve is as you suggest time. Ripple and XRP holders are losing every day some competitive advantage, and as unfair as it is, the SEC knows this very well how damaging this can be and are trying to push this way some settlement which will somehow save what can still be saved",

The case didn't happen **only** because a few corrupt SEC folks wanted to fill their pockets, it also involves the folks and organisations who were willing to pay them, e.g. motives of organisations they were affiliated with, or moved to work for or will move to work for.\n\nIf at the end XRP comes out as one of the only assets that has been cleared and OKd by the SEC, then that clarity was obviously never the reason the SEC raised the case in the first place, because I doubt the corrupt folks would have planned this so poorly that Ripple/XRP somehow could at the end get the upper hand. I believe the intention has been to stop any advancements Ripple potentially had in North America and with it also to damage the reputation elsewhere....Worldwide FUD toward Ripple.\n\nHopefully that doesn't sound too \"tinfoily\", if it does, then I also need a reality check.",

They may have slowed ripple down a bit, but really have they? I\u2019m sure ripple has still been pressing forward, and after this there will be virtually no uncertainty around the classification of XRP. \n\nWhy have potential banks and potential payment providers in the US been hesitant to use it?

There's no written record or communication of this. No testimony by anyone else has uncovered this.\n\nFACT: In that same testimony Hinman agreed that his division had not clarified the digital asset situation to the markets through regulation nor through rule-making, nor interpretive reliefs during his entire tenure (or since that time if you believe more recent statements from two of the current sitting commissioners).",

Makes you realise how much work truly goes into the case (and that a smaller outfit without such deep pockets would struggle).",

In my companies Slack messages are mostly banter at about the same level as water-cooler discussions where you might end with \"...I'll send you an email with the details!\"\n\nAlso... Slack messages are not a permanent form of communication. They can be deleted, edited and blown away at any time. \n\nRipple could easily go back and edited everything and there'd be no record of that.\n\nThis is farcical if the judge allows it.\n\nEDIT: It's a bullshit play by the SEC. They clearly have nothing from 6-months of discovery and are now - as a  last-ditch - going after all internal \"chat\" in the hope that something pops up. How do you launch litigation like that after several years of prior investigation?",

We\u2019ve seen that the SEC, which is not a fin-tech smart , prefer to take more of a regulatory roll than a technological roll. The Fed doesn\u2019t have to own the technology to use its government influence to make sure it controls whichever technology gets official government charter. It\u2019s like going \u201cIBM compatible\u201d was in the early days of personal computers. It didn\u2019t matter much who built the computer back then, so long as it was \u201cIBM compatible.\u201d Being Fed-compatible will be everything for banks and for the government. The Fed doesn\u2019t have to take the failure risks of being first when it can let creative competition create the best products and then seize regulatory control upon the first serious breakdown in digital use (or even before just by persuading congress)",

I think more likely they will reach a settlement when expert discovery is concluded rather than risk a loss that would set a precedent; if Ripple wins fair notice, it would basically bar the SEC from going after *any* crypto. Which is the last thing they want-- a settlement where they can fine Ripple for early sales, (2012-2015 or something) allows them to save face and keeps the door open for them to litigate other tokens in the future but grants Ripple the clarity they desperately need. I think this is the most likely outcome; they can 'claim' victory and Ripple can continue to grow the business inside the USA.",

I never remember seeing anything like that, but you may be right. Dropping it is John Deaton's main fear and I don't think there's anything that wouldn't allow the SEC to drop it, but I suppose it's possible.\n\nHonestly I think the SEC is too bull headed to drop it *even if* they are facing a losing battle; the optics look extremely bad and with everything that has come out, it would be difficult to turn around with a unique enough charge as they cannot drop it then return with a lawsuit that is too similar-- it would have to be brand new charges that don't mirror what they've already charged them with.\n\nMy assumption is that if the judge does not strike the fair notice defense, they will scramble to the table rather than let it go to summary judgement and risk losing that; while they could appeal, it would effectively set a precedent and give immunity to virtually every token with how vague their charges are. The language the SEC uses applies to virtually *every* token today.",

The SEC opposes on the grounds that the interrogatory is vague and ambiguous, and that it misapprehends the SEC\u2019s decision-making process, which generally does not make determinations as to specific financial instruments\u2019 status. To the extent that the SEC relies on previous unsworn admissions to respond to this interrogatory, the SEC is directed to supplement its response so that it complies with Rule 33(b)(3). The Court does not otherwise find the SEC\u2019s response evasive or incomplete; the SEC has explained to Ripple that it does not typically determine whether a particular financial instrument is or is not a security. Defendants\u2019 motion regarding Ripple Interrogatory No. 6 is GRANTED only insofar as the SEC is ordered to supplement its response to comply with Rule 33(b)(3).\u201d\n\nCan someone confirm this means we won\u2019t get an answer as to whether ETH and BTC are securities?",

So the SEC will say, UNDER OATH, (a) they have made no determination as to Ethereum\u2019s status, essentially nullifying Hinman\u2019s free pass, or (b) say that Ethereum is a security, literally nullifying Hinman\u2019s free pass, or (c) say Ethereum is not a security, in which case Ripple will say that XRP shouldn\u2019t be seen as a security either because, unlike Ethereum, Ripple never held an ICO, and the XRPL is both fully functional and more decentralized than Ethereum",

He even foreshadowed it was coming.\n\nAnd when you look at how he exchanges with Brad in 2019 @ Davos, you can tell by his body language how uncomfortable he is sitting at a panel with Brad Garlinghouse.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzgTTsOOk04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzgTTsOOk04)\n\nThey have a few exchange of words but there is a moment I'd like to point out that many of you probably didn't see before but some of us know about.\n\n**@ 27:40 mark:**\n\n**Lubin:** So, XRP is a value token and it trades in an open market. If the CFTC noticed you own 60% of the silver supply, how comfortable would they be?\n\n**Brad:** I won't speak for the CFTC. We have in escrow 55% of all XRP that we own. We can't sell it. We can't do anything with it. So we actually only own 13%...\n\n**Lubin Interrupts:** But you do sell it regularly? Don't you sell it into the market?\n\n**Brad:** We're very transparent about that. How much do you sell?\n\n**Lubin:** Um...when necessary...\n\n**Brad Interrupts:** Transparency in this market(?) is critical. Look I'm talking about transparency because the whole industry to mature we need to be transparent in the industry. Ripple, I think, has tried to lead by example with that I think there are other ecosystems that I have no idea what is going on in those ecosystems. I don't think that's good for the whole industry and I think that's bad for Ripple, too.\n\n**Later on @ 31:07:**\n\n**Robert Hackett (Moderator):** Joe, it's been said you are one of the biggest ETH holders. How do you go about managing your treasury within consensus and your own personal one?\n\n**Lubin:** \\[Laughs\\] I guess no comment. We personally in terms of consensus we're a small fraction of the ETH asset and all the assets on the ETH platform and we manage our treasury like a company would manage a treasury.\n\n**Brad:** The only interjection I have here is, I find it interesting that Ripple is attacked for being transparent because we are very proactive; in fact the next XRP market report is coming out next week, but because we share that information we are attacked for it. Yet - other platforms don't share that information so they are insulated from the same critiques and criticisms. **I think in the dictionary that is called hypocrisy.**",

You can certainly expect an official announcement from us with a timeline of events as soon as possible. This will lay out our exact plans for distribution.   \nJust let us know if there is anything else we can assist you with in the meantime : )  \nSincerely,  \nAnthony Armstrong  \nBTC Markets Pty Ltd",

You already said that Kraken will support Flare. When Flare token will be distributed, is not my question. As you know, Songbird (SGB)is an Airdrop on the same account of my XRP. \n\n2 questions: are you going to support SGB? If not? Are you going to make a separate wallet from where I can send it to my private wallet or are you going to send it to my private wallet. The SGB is going to be send to the Kraken Wallet, but it is mine. Can you please elaborate how I can get my SGB?\n\nThank you.\n\nSincerly,",

A few of the recent airdrops have been creating custom exchange pairs on solo and I have been arbitraging a few when the opportunity arises. \n\nSologenics use case is on Hold in the US likely waiting on precedent in the Ripple Sec case. The European side will launch soon. Cant make guarantees about market behavior but Solo is very under valued. You can see it on the charts. Smart money buys the lows on good projects. People don't like solo because the dex doesn't have a lot of volumes so people scream scam but the tech works. Go make a token and a custom exchange pair, it's easy. Most don't think they are offering enough incentives to use the network but again I think this is because of the use case. They're going for the regulated market where they are responsible for creating tokenized securities. This is a platform of businesses and quick access to a interconnected dex. Potential is much greater than its currently valued. Buy an hold",

Cry baby is a bit extreme when it is an airdrop worth 30 cents a coin last I looked.  For some folks that is a hefty chunk of change we would have in our possession had we not trusted the support.  400 dollars might not be much to you but, it could be every hard earned extra scrap of money left from their budget. I'm not tech savvy.  Computers were identified by a 3 digit number when I was in school. I am tech savvy enough to see the potential in crypto and purchased some. Last fall I wasn't comfortable moving it from an exchange. When the answer to not getting 10s of thousands of dollars I would have because I wasn't \"promised\" that airdrop is legitimately a valid grievance.\nDidn't downvote you, you led with unpopular. $436.14 is probably close to what I have paid CB in fees this year alone. I am a customer.  Making us feel like you ripped us off.....actual letter of the law theft or not, it is how we feel, that is how you lose customers.",

While you can still buy the dip, it kind of defeats the purpose of DCA.   \n\n\nBear in mind something though:   \n\n\nI buy 10.000 XRP at various pricepoints, with an average cost of $0.17. I have some extra money that I want to invest, let's say I have enough to buy 2500 XRP @ 0.95. I'm worried that this will \"ruin\" my DCA. Let's consider two: scenarios.   \n\n\n**Scenario 1:**   \nI buy 10.000 XRP @  an average price of $0.17. I sell my XRP at $5   \nI buy 2500 IOTA @ 0.95, and sell them at $5. \n\n10.000 XRP bought for $1700 and sold for $50.000 means $48.300 in profits.   \n2500 IOTA bought for $2375 and sold for $12.500 means $10.125 in profits\n\nTotal profits in scenario 1: $58.425   \n\n\n**Scenario 2:**   \nI buy 10.000 XRP @  an average price of $0.17.   \nI buy 2500 XRP @ 0.95  \nMy DCA is now $0.326 (using weighted average).   \n\n\nI then sell my 12500 XRP @ $5, netting me - you guessed it - $58.425 in profits. \n\n  \nIncreasing your DCA doesn't mean you've suddenly paid more for the XRP you had prior to your last purchase. DCA is a strategy different strategy than buying the dip.",

It could be that since he\u2019s down to his last scheduled allotment of XRP he\u2019s decided to await price appreciation to maximize his final cash out at some future yet to be determined date. Or\u2026.maybe he knows that something big is about to happen. This coming Tuesday is the deadline for the SEC to turn over to Judge Netburn all of the communications that they\u2019ve been trying to withhold. She will privately review them and than make determinations regarding the SEC\u2019s privilege claims (SEC is trying to withhold pretty much everything). What will she see? Did the SEC have discussions with/about Jed? Did Jed supply the SEC with confidential and/or privileged info obtained during his time with Ripple? Does Jed know what the SEC has been fighting so desperately to withhold? Does he know that this case is over once those documents get tuned over to Judge Netburn? Maybe he knows that what\u2019s in there is so damaging that the SEC will never submit the documents. They\u2019ll either settle before Tuesday, or just withhold them with the understanding that Judge Netburn will probably dismiss the case, and they can blame the judge for the loss? Which might explain why they\u2019re suddenly going after Uniswap and Coinbase, and probably a bunch of others, to try to rack up wins to compensate for this disaster. I think they tried to run out the clock, knowing that after fact discovery ended on the 31st they\u2019d be home free, hoping Judge Netburn would let them slide, but their bluff got called. Now it\u2019s \u201cshow your cards\u201d time. I think they fold",

Here's why:\n\n* BTC finally broke above and closed the weekly candle above the 0.618 fib (\\~ $51k). 50k has been a stubborn resistance, and it's nice to see it close above. Next up is the 0.702 $ around $54k\n* Several altcoins are setting new ATHs in the last week, including Solana and Cardano\n* ETH closed it's weekly candle at almost $4k; this is the same level as the highest weekly candle back in May. It's back at almost 90 % of it's previous ATH\n* XRP has historically been late to go parabolic; in both 2013 and 2017/2018 we were the ones finishing off the bull season. After a nice start to August, we've been ranging sideways for a few weeks, but last week we closed above $1.30 which has been a resistance for us the last few weeks. In fact, it's our highest weekly candle since mid-May. Next hurdle is at 1.41 (0.618) and the infamous .702 is at 1.54\n* SEC-case has had some interesting developments in the last few weeks; a lot of pudits are speculating that it'll be settled and if so, that a settlement might be coming in mid September. Who knows; but it might affect the price\n\nHope you have a good start to your week, and fingers crossed that we are finally off to the moon.  \n\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

Probably in stages: from the news itself, exchanges resuming XRP trading, institutional investors returning, Ripple partners returning/ new ones starting, corporations investing in XRP, corporations using XRP and Ripple announcing an IPO. XRP will also have unique legal clarity in the US, which will make it a less risky investment compared to others (especially if the SEC starts blasting away at crypto projects), which is a big deal for institutional investors in particular.",

I do hope the case comes to a conclusion before the bull run though. I've posted numbers in another daily thread, but if the SEC case hadn't happened, we'd probably be above the previous ATH by now. It would be helpful to get that extra boost from a settled case, potential clarity and last but not least, relisting.\n\nEdit: seems mid-september is an estimate based on the fact that SEC must provide unredacted copies of documents to the judge by Sept 14th. I guess the argument is that that will make the case. Not sure how realistic it is, but here's hoping :)",

Trading in ETH and BTC beyond 2018 (including after the Hinman Speech) is highly likely. That's what the SEC are trying to hide. If Hinman or Clayton (or anyone in the chain of 64-odd people who handled/edited Hinman's speech) held ETH... it's game over.\n\nAlso brings into question... that if the SEC employees could trade XRP before 2018... how can the SEC only now say that others (including Ripple founders) couldn't because it was supposedly a security that whole time (even before the SEC told their own staff)!\n\nLet alone that they never told anyone else... and still refuse to answer any questions in the matter such as \"is ETH a security?\"\n\nUnder what reasoning was XRP added to a no-trade list in 2018... yet ETH wasn't?

(Laughably false)\n\nAnd hence why the SEC is trying to state that Hinman's statements on ETH were his *opinion,* (despite **several** live segments of him on video stating that \"We (who is we other than the agency??) believe ETH to be decentralized enough to be a currency/utility.\" \n\nThe entire case is a fucking house of cards, the SEC knows this, which is why they are scrambling/withholding documents, etc.\n\nRipple has them by the balls and they know that if they lose this XRP creates a precedent and they'll have an extremely hard time going after *any* crypto. Hell they were basically begging the judge and \"warning\" that if they lose it will have a catastrophic affect on their ability to go after *any* crypto. They just went after the wrong horse, as I do think the space is ripe with fraud, but going after the one crypto that arguably has more utility nor held a ICO, (other than a store of value) is bizarre and ripe with corruption.",

What form the outcome will look like and how long this will take is anyone's guess though. The SEC will try to drag it and drag it and drag it out to force Ripple into some form of settlement (that's their MO because then they can say they \"won\").\n\nEven if Ripple have to pay some $$$ amount for early XRP sales - the outcome for current and future XRP will be bright. The big problem is that the SEC have now been branded as incompetent and corrupt - with substantial evidence to back those claims available. You can't put a price on that damage. Gensler's reputation is now equally tarnished as he's being seen to fuel the fire and make things worse rather than step in from Clayton and lead the commission. \n\nThere are now influential billionaires (Mark Cuban) and politicians calling on the SEC and Gensler to pull their heads in and get their house in order. The \"court\" of public opinion has adjourned!\n\nLet the shit-show continue though...\n\n <insert popcorn eating meme>",

Regarding the outcome, it is obvious that in a fair judgement the SEC stands zero chance to succeed. The amount of accumulated evidence that there is no case is just overwhelming, and that is an understatement. I am still worried though about excessive political being exercised on the judge though. There is so much at stake.\n\n. Reputational damage...hmmm. First, this legal fight has not made it to the very big headlines of the non financial mainstream media. Second, it is as if you ask Al Capone if he cares about the mafia's reputation: he can't care less as long as he has the police department in his pocket. So far, in spite of growing evidence of corruption at the highest levels of the commission, the SEC has been given so much free hands by whoever is supposed to supervise them that I cannot imagine there is not some sort of collusion\n\n. I agree with you that Gensler let the opportunity go to whistle the end of the game and tell the World he is not part of this shit show. Instead, he endorsed fully the role of big orchestrator, and will have to bear personally the consequences of the outcome\n\n. The only real card the SEC has left in its sleeve is as you suggest time. Ripple and XRP holders are losing every day some competitive advantage, and as unfair as it is, the SEC knows this very well how damaging this can be and are trying to push this way some settlement which will somehow save what can still be saved",

The case didn't happen **only** because a few corrupt SEC folks wanted to fill their pockets, it also involves the folks and organisations who were willing to pay them, e.g. motives of organisations they were affiliated with, or moved to work for or will move to work for.\n\nIf at the end XRP comes out as one of the only assets that has been cleared and OKd by the SEC, then that clarity was obviously never the reason the SEC raised the case in the first place, because I doubt the corrupt folks would have planned this so poorly that Ripple/XRP somehow could at the end get the upper hand. I believe the intention has been to stop any advancements Ripple potentially had in North America and with it also to damage the reputation elsewhere....Worldwide FUD toward Ripple.\n\nHopefully that doesn't sound too \"tinfoily\", if it does, then I also need a reality check.",

They may have slowed ripple down a bit, but really have they? I\u2019m sure ripple has still been pressing forward, and after this there will be virtually no uncertainty around the classification of XRP. \n\nWhy have potential banks and potential payment providers in the US been hesitant to use it? Maybe because they knew something like this could happen to something that has no clarity.

There's no written record or communication of this. No testimony by anyone else has uncovered this.\n\nFACT: In that same testimony Hinman agreed that his division had not clarified the digital asset situation to the markets through regulation nor through rule-making, nor interpretive reliefs during his entire tenure (or since that time if you believe more recent statements from two of the current sitting commissioners).",

Makes you realise how much work truly goes into the case (and that a smaller outfit without such deep pockets would struggle).",

In my companies Slack messages are mostly banter at about the same level as water-cooler discussions where you might end with \"...I'll send you an email with the details!\"\n\nAlso... Slack messages are not a permanent form of communication. They can be deleted, edited and blown away at any time. \n\nRipple could easily go back and edited everything and there'd be no record of that.\n\nThis is farcical if the judge allows it.\n\nEDIT: It's a bullshit play by the SEC. They clearly have nothing from 6-months of discovery and are now - as a  last-ditch - going after all internal \"chat\" in the hope that something pops up. How do you launch litigation like that after several years of prior investigation?",

If you\u2019re serious about accumulating long term wealth, in reality, another year is nothing, and one would only look at it as further opportunity to accumulate more XRP under favorable circumstances with the way the lawsuit is going. \n\nSome may have reached their own goals, or their own amount of total money they were willing to invest in the project. To each their own, if you have an investment strategy that you are confident in, then see it through. \n\nA year is the maximum amount of time this can drag out for at this point. The finish line is in sight, and it\u2019s very possible a settlement will happen before then. The SEC is not the favorite at this point. I never thought they were, I knew from day one they had a meritless lawsuit. If the judge was at all objective, XRP would come out on top. \n\nSo think for the long term, detach from the daily events, the daily price swings, and stay confident in the fundamentals. I never think that you can have to much of something that is valuable, so to me, I will keep accumulating when I get the opportunity. Remember there is more to life than crypto, and more to life than money. The only caveat is having money may allow you to truly experience everything else there is to offer, at least to the point where you don\u2019t have to be a wage slave for half of your waking hours every week.\n\nIt\u2019s coming ;)",

These are still early days, BTCs value is derived 100% speculation, but why? It offers no utility, is terrible for transactions, and other tokens can suit the purpose of \"store of value.\" I often hear the argument that because of the high mining rates, it's \"truly\" decentralized, but they neglect the glaring fact that roughly 65% of BTC mining pools originate in China, hardly decentralized.\n\nYes, Ripple holds about 60% of the supply of XRP, but that's dwindling as more utility is brought on, more corridors are opened and more supply is released. Ripple only accounts for 6% of the validators and in fact amendments have been made that were not influenced by Ripple.\n\nI don't think BTC is going anywhere, but this tribalism is doing nothing but harming the ecosystem",

I do hope I'm wrong, I think most of us here would prefer a settlement if it results in XRP becoming the first cryptocurrency with true regulatory clarity in the US.\n\nI used to hold that position as well (believing a settlement would be inevitable if the SEC lost their attempt to withhold the Hinman emails). That changed for me once I saw their Motion for Reconsideration. I think that was truly unprecedented and something no one expected, even Jeremy Hogan and James Filan. That motion in itself is so damaging to the SEC's position I'm surprised they filed it. It could very well hamstring their future enforcement actions without even having a single Hinman-related email turned over.\n\nThat recklessness to me indicates they will go to any length to secure a win in this case specifically. I believe reason has given way to ego, and with that any hope of a settlement is gone. They will sacrifice their capability to bring enforcement action in the future hoping something they have will convince the judges or a jury despite everything else, even if it's an extremely small chance of success.\n\nRemember, even if this case is dropped, future defendants can now point to Judge Netburn's ruling on the Hinman emails. So, in some way, it's already too late to prevent these emails from being targeted. Given that, I believe they will push ahead even if forced to turn these emails over in hopes of still achieving a surprise victory against Ripple.",

Playing the long game sometimes takes\u2026a long time. When you have corrupt government agencies literally trying to game the system they created in the first place, it can throw a wrench in the mix, but for the investor who is absolutely serious in accumulating as much as he can, based on what he believes the fundamental price is, and will be in the future, then it is simply more time to accumulate. \n\nI would highly recommend throwing your entire life to the side, and just grind and hustle to make as much money as literally possible in whatever given situation you are in, that\u2019s what I did, and it worked in a whole lot of ways. It\u2019s not always practical, it is unsustainable, and most importantly it will drive your mental health into the dirt. There are more things to life than just having money. Drug addiction is entirely possible while finding ways to continue. \n\nBut could financial independence bring you the ability to focus on other things in life besides money, could it give you the freedom to truly enjoy what the world has to offer? I believe so. I believe not having to spend any time at all worrying about money is a life where you can truly enjoy everything there is to offer. I have a lifestyle I want to live, that I believe will make me happy, and I\u2019m going to chase after it. \n\nI\u2019ve been retired from the insane 70+ hour weeks, no days off for almost a year now. I was forced to be, ironically. 3 years after starting out with nothing, I bought my 2021 civic type R brand new from the dealership, and someone rear ended me at a stoplight doing 40mph within the same week that I bought it. I tried to actually continue working, but I had been whiplashed and got a concussion, which forced me to take months off of work, and am actually just starting to round the corner to the finish line on being completely recovered. \n\nWithin that time, I got married, met my wife, and was basically forced to take a complete hiatus from my old lifestyle. I invested all of my time into a relationship, something I hadn\u2019t done or even thought about doing for years because I was so hell bent on getting every bit of crypto I could. I learned there is far more to life than just grinding and hustling, and that relationships have unequivocal value. \n\nIf xrp is still at a bargain when I receive an insurance payout, I will be taking a large portion of it and investing it. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t drag out that far and everyone who has held this long will be rewarded handsomely very soon, but if not, I\u2019ll just have a couple more carry on items for the spaceship before it launches ;) \n\nStay wealthy my friends",

I am a very honest sincere person. But I never thought for one second a government agency would destroy my investment and pleasure as a small investor. I still hold XRP but as soon as the opportunity to sell occurs I will. I am now sick to death of what has happened and as always it\u2019s the small investors like ourselves who always suffer.

Case in point, SEC submits a SWORN AFFIDAVIT from Hinman in support of his contention that the Ethereum \u201cfree pass speech\u201d was just his opinion. Than they later argue that the speech reflects the position of the SEC\u2019s Corporate Finance Division (which Hinman led), was meant to provide \u201cmarket guidance, and again support this contention with a SWORN AFFIDAVIT. A complete contradiction of their earlier claim. They are blatantly lying to the court, making a mockery of our judicial system and destroying the credibility of the SEC. Why?? The same reason that Clayton, Hinman and others left the SEC IMMEDIATELY after bringing the action against Ripple, and they all took jobs in the crypto industry, not coincidentally with Ethereum affiliated entities, knowing full well how unethical it would appear. The reason is that the amount of money at stake is so enormous that they are willing to sacrifice everything, their reputations, the integrity of our institutions, everything for a stake in this once in lifetime, multi generational wealth creating opportunity. So those are the stakes. For the winners, and by all accounts Ripple is winning this court case, granted not fast enough for our liking, but they are winning, the prize is wealth beyond your wildest imagination. And more importantly the freedom to live your life on your own terms, beholden to no man. Can you hold out for another month? Another year? I damn sure can. They\u2019ll never break me. They\u2019ll have to pry my XRP from my cold dying hand!",

I did just happen to read the new roadmap link from their twitter.. it seems they will have a governance update on token distribution. you still get the initial 15% read below and it makes sense. So im guessing from this the remaining spark tokens after the initial15% of tokens dropped will be voted on thru governance thru a proposal they have been working on. below is from their roadmap.\n\n(FL02: Governance Update On Token Distribution: The team has been working on a governance proposal regarding the token distribution. The proposal intends to achieve three things)\n\n(The governance vote for this proposal will only take place once 75% of the initial 15% distribution is freely available to take part in the governance vote. In the case of exchanges, this means that the token will have been distributed and can be withdrawn from the exchange. The proposal details will be published with ample advance warning before Flare launches.)",

That has now been dragging on for 16 months - the whole time XRP has been removed from exchanges across the US (leaving many holders stranded and confused). \n\nI would hate for that to happen to me if I invest in any other cryptocurrency. Can you please help to protect me by simply telling me which ones are securities and which are not?\n\nI understand that you cannot comment on active litigation, so we can skip XRP. Perhaps we can start with ETH... is ETH a security?\"",

Jesse Powell is in the first one and Chris Larsen is in the second, but Jed is a recipient of both. The first one essentially says that what Ripple is offering is a security, at which point Ripple revised their business plan and went back to the firm and the firm concluded that now it was NOT a security. I always wondered how the SEC got their hands on these legal memos which one would think would be protected by attorney client privilege\u2026unless a member of the team waived the privilege. Did Jed waive the privilege, and turn over the FIRST memo to the SEC, but not the SECOND memo, leading the SEC to mistakenly believe that Ripple had gone against the advise of their lawyers and sold an unregistered security??? \ud83e\udd14\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/filanlaw/status/1494821377701986304",

I've seen a lot of his interviews where he's asked pretty clear cut questions and he skirts around it by saying 'come register with the SEC and we'll work it out'. \n\nI mean, if you can't answer some pretty straight forward questions in a public interview (in some cases, even to congress) that state what is and what is not a security, how is this providing any form of clarity/fair notice? In that recent interview he intentionally left out the 4th prong of the howey test - something that is indisputably a defining factor, in one of his security vs. Not security examples. This is obviously misleading information.\n\nShould the rules not be the same for everyone and publically available whether your registered with the SEC or not?",

It sparked a quick conversation but I was surprised to hear he purchased some Bitcoin last year but never heard of any other crypto besides Ethereum. And that's the way it is with many of my friends and family. Smaller yet are the ones who actually hold any crypto at all.\n\nAnd I was there 4 years ago. I consider myself \"techy\" and had friends into mining Bitcoin but I had no interest in blockchains or cryptocurrency. Honestly I didn't even know there was a thing called alt-coins.\n\nIt wasn't until I had a double date that my buddy mentioned XRP and Ripple. It unearthed this mysterious market from what felt like right underneath me. Within 2 days I had done enough research to be convinced to get myself into XRP. \n\nMuch has changed since then. My attitude is more grounded and mature from \"moonboi\" to factual and intelligent conversations (although I still love cracking jokes). The crypto space has matured as well as it crawls its way into solving real-world problems. There is still a long road ahead, but the horizon is showing that blockchain will be part of our futures. Whatever crypto coin you hold, there is a little voice in the back of your head telling you that the crypto space is conforming into *something*. Oh, and to hodl, of course.\n\nI'm grateful that I'm here in this fucked up space with you fine lads. The short term looks dreary with the SEC lawsuit but Ripple hasn't skipped a beat executing it's objectives globally. Every country has their own set of rules/laws/regulations and there isn't a single other business remotely close to the global scale that Ripple has. They are playing chess with SWIFT and their pieces seem very well placed. \n\nI'll be damned if I had to look back at myself and wonder why I didn't hodl any XRP.",

Look at it from this perspective XRP has been around for many years and has always been a speculation coin of what its use case can do and now it has the chance to have clairty and move forward.. Without the SEC/Ripple lawsuit it for certain would have still been awating clairty for who knows how many years.\n\nDo you want a  $5.00 speculated price and hope to sell at the top or would you rather have clairtiy and real use with a stable price that can incrase for years to come?",

You would think it would have to give the exchanges a time frame in which to tidy up and also a basis for determining if the products they are offering are securities or not. Is Ripple/XRP that basis? Will the Howey test become the Ripple test? I don\u2019t think the case has even started to get anywhere close to upholding that type of standard. It would have to go through an extreme amount of scrutiny to be held up to that basis. That would take additional years. With all the money on the line, my guess would be that the executive order will simply say that the exchanges have to put extreme disclaimers on the front page of their sites and do advanced KYC. Then SEC/Ripple settles with some type of clarity saying that institutions won\u2019t be illegally using a product, Ripple and other legitimate companies continue to educate the powers that be to create a standard, and\u2026XRP moon.\nJust my wishful thinking.",

What makes sense in my mind is the US (and other countries) begin a green list of crypto currencies they see fit as \"safe\" or \"trusted\" enough while other cryptos are banned. \n\nThe executive order may induce fear because I doubt they will mention any \"good\" cryptocurrencies and it will probably \"paint us with a broad brush\" again.\n\nI think a crackdown is necessary - this market is oversaturated and it will help the few good cryptocurrencies to thrive, expand, and hopefully increase in value.",

Look, nobody knows how the SEC case will play out, but we\u2019ll have a pretty good idea within the next few days when a Judge Torres rules on the fair notice defense motion. If the SEC\u2019s position is weakened and they\u2019re forced to settle or drop the case (or lose the case at summary judgement), the upside for XRP\u2019s price will be INSANE. In fact, I think what we\u2019re seeing rt now is the market pricing in an SEC loss or settlement. If you have a little money you can afford lose, why not throw a cpl grand in? If the SEC wins you lose a cpl grand, but if they lose, the cpl grand turn into a 5 or 6 figure payday. Where else are you gonna get that kind of return on investment?

I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re hearing all of this talk abt an executive order to try and bail them out. But that won\u2019t work. Imagine they try to say that all crypto are securities, and than they get bogged down in legal challenges abt the constitutionality of the order. Meanwhile Ethereum, their preferred crypto, gets labeled a security too, because they\u2019ve sworn under oath that the \u201cfree pass\u201d was just Hinman\u2019s opinion. So the playing field is leveled because all crypto is dead in the US, including Ethereum, and the rest of the world moves forward using Ripple who\u2019ve been quietly building their overseas business the whole time. That ain\u2019t gonna happen. I think the backup plan is to go after the exchanges. That way they can pick winners and losers by making the exchanges register and than telling them which cryptos they can or can\u2019t list. But that ain\u2019t gonna work either because decentralized exchanges will continue to thrive. The SEC screwed the pooch on this one",

I would have to totally agree with him.Many people are quite fooled in this space just throwing fiat into anything in hopes of making a buck and never even consider every project/idea is starting out as a funding project in big hopes of a use case. It has become so routine to think of a use case and test the waters and if it slightly works more projects will do the same in following suit to get their fair share of funding.\n\nRipple/XRP i will say actually has put forth a massive amount of effort and time over the years to position itself with a very good usecase and has kept true to its original plan. Sure they made changes thruout the years but still have the original use case End Goal in mind. There are also a few other older platforms/projects that have stayed laser focused as well with their original plans.\n\nWhat i don't like seeing is all this new type of trying to be creative on existing platforms trying to sell a use case when its all nothing more then disguised fundraising tactics. I'm saying all this because of whats happening on XRP/xrpl as well as other platforms getting ruined by these tactics. This gives Goverments or any other authority (SEC) reason to come in swinging the way they have reguarding. regulations. \n\nCZ's tweet.\n\n(Yield farming, transaction mining, airdrops are decent ways to jump start a project (attract an initial user base), but you still need to build real use cases. Otherwise, the project won't be sustainable in the long run.)",

Ripple only accounts for 6% of the validators and in fact amendments have been made that were not influenced by Ripple.\n\nI don't think BTC is going anywhere, but this tribalism is doing nothing but harming the ecosystem",

Up to this point I don't think the SEC have really believed that they will have to turnover the emails so have been in no hurry to settle to Ripples demands which would include clarity that XRP is not a security.\n\nAs you states all 3 of the outstanding issues could potentially be very damaging to the SEC's case AND other cases that they may bring further down the line to other Tokens and currencies.\n\nThey will most definitely appeal to Judge Torres regarding the emails, I 100% believe they will do this and I also believe that Judge Torres will deny their appeal, however there seems to be somethings in these emails that could be far to damaging for the SEC to let people see, at that point they will have no choice but to settle and settle favourably towards Ripple and XRP.\n\nBy not agreeing to the terms Ripple have been asking for regarding settlement right now the SEC will be a much worse position for negotiation once the emails appeal has been denied.\n\nI fully expect a settlement in the next 2 or 3 months and that's not even thinking about the other 2 outstanding issues. The emails alone should see us to a settlement.",

I do hope I'm wrong, I think most of us here would prefer a settlement if it results in XRP becoming the first cryptocurrency with true regulatory clarity in the US.\n\nI used to hold that position as well (believing a settlement would be inevitable if the SEC lost their attempt to withhold the Hinman emails). That changed for me once I saw their Motion for Reconsideration. I think that was truly unprecedented and something no one expected, even Jeremy Hogan and James Filan. That motion in itself is so damaging to the SEC's position I'm surprised they filed it. It could very well hamstring their future enforcement actions without even having a single Hinman-related email turned over.\n\nThat recklessness to me indicates they will go to any length to secure a win in this case specifically. I believe reason has given way to ego, and with that any hope of a settlement is gone. They will sacrifice their capability to bring enforcement action in the future hoping something they have will convince the judges or a jury despite everything else, even if it's an extremely small chance of success.\n\nRemember, even if this case is dropped, future defendants can now point to Judge Netburn's ruling on the Hinman emails. So, in some way, it's already too late to prevent these emails from being targeted. Given that, I believe they will push ahead even if forced to turn these emails over in hopes of still achieving a surprise victory against Ripple.",

They're a two-employee holding company for a few assorted stakes in various companies: \n\n* a VOIP phone provider that hasn't picked up any new customers since 2015;\n* an MOU with PVCombank which doesn't mean anything;\n* an 18% stake in \"an online short\u00adterm P2P financing platform for SMEs in Vietnam\" which cost them $300k (half of which they paid in shares of Vemanti instead of Actual Money);\n* a stablecoin project that's been shut down after burning through over a million dollars of consulting expenses (\"As of February 22, 2022, the Company has terminated its agreements with Stably and FDT, and all USDV tokens have been burned.\"); and,\n* about eight grand worth of bitcoin. \n\nThey hold themselves out as some sort of fintech venture fund, but they also say \"we are currently not in any discussions with any parties regarding acquisitions or joint ventures\". And they haven't made a profit since 2015.\n\nAnyway, it doesn't make any sense for these guys (and remember, there's only two of them) to be working with Ripple, as a partner or a customer. None of Vemanti's businesses have any kind of need for cross-border payments. \n\n(As a side note, VMNT is worth like $50 million despite having, as best I can tell, continued losses, no prospect of paying a dividend, and no meaningful business except for the stake in Fvndit. If I was the CEO of this thing, I'd be selling as many shares as I possibly could, because the stock is *expensive.*)",

IMO I think Ripple will flesh out the system with liquidity after they IPO then switch boom partners start using ODL with a much more significant volume of payments. \n\nSome believe that even with significant adoption and massive increases in volume the price will be unaffected.

Governments in conjunction with ISO20022 can only spell good news for the crypto space because they can work with the experts to further grow the industry. Isn\u2019t this what we all want?

Meaning the lawsuit won't simply get thrown out in Ripple's favor.   \nBut also\n\n2) Maybe SEC was more deeply involved in Hinman\u2019s speech than they admit, meaning it wasn't simply personal opinion but the Commission's own feelings too and Ripple would've naturally concluded that since the SEC (via Hinman) said ETH sales are not securities then XRP sales are not securities.\n\nSo... I'm thinking two things here.\n\nFirst, it seems that even if Ripple was warned, it doesn't mean they lose. It means the lawsuit isn't thrown out early. Because if the SEC was involved in the Hinman speech then Ripple acted as they should have. \n\nSecond, even if *both* go against Ripple, Ripple could still win because **XRP is not a security** no matter what Ripple may have been told *it may appear to be* (no one is claiming their lawyers said it IS a security, only that they said it may *appear* to be) and also no matter what Hinman's *personal opinion* was. \n\nThoughts? Not sure if I've got it.",

The best example I've heard legal minds use is posted speed limit signs. Yeah its obvious speeding is bad but without a sign specifying it becomes a trap. Ripple speaking with counsel is not in any way related to the general public nor the SEC and their official positions. Evidence from the rest of planet earth shows it is not a security in any capacity. Hell, FinCen fined Ripple for NOT REGISTERING XRP as a CURRENCY in 2015 and WON so there is that... Here is the actual settlement documents. Here is FinCen's announcement of enforcement.\n\nhttps://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-fines-ripple-labs-inc-first-civil-enforcement-action-against-virtual\nhttps://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/file/765721/download",

If that is true, it just adds credence to the fact that Ripple Labs was given mixed signals by the SEC. This would severely weaken the SEC\u2019s case against a Ripple Labs.

This case has dragged on my longer than people expects, but i feel like going for a settlement would be a loss for xrp and crypto in general. Fuck that! And go for the kill!",

We have large banking monopolies. Fiefdoms of huge mega banks that own tens of thousands of regional banks. Anytime a bank creates a interest-bearing financial product its directly sold into the interbank market up the food chain to one of the big 6. The bank receives monthly cash flow from this now its a interconnected debt obligation. Whereby one financial institution's health is connected to another. This becomes a problem like you say when they make poor financial decisions with their customer's deposits because there is no longer a distinction between investment banks and depository institutions like there should/used to be. When a central counterparty does a bad and goes insolvent the whole system collapses because no one makes payments on those interconnected debt obligations. This is what Ripplenet and the XRPL are designed to solve, counterparty risk.",

Firstly, thank you for proactively taking on this role as I have not seen any directives that make this formal.\n\nAs an investor - apparently in desperate need of protection by the SEC - I am deeply concerned about what types of assets cryptocurrency exchanges allow me to trade. Specifically, I remain concerned about which cryptocurrencies are securities or otherwise. This has significant implications on their practical usability and is not something that is immediately clear from the guidance (or the lack thereof) issued by the SEC over the past decade.\n\nIt's not clear to me which SEC speeches are guidance or simply \"personal opinion\". It's not clear to me which documents on the SEC website are guidance or just the transcripts of other \"personal opinions\". It's also not clear to me how I can safely invest in one cryptocurrency vs another - as the SEC refuses to comment on any one specific example.\n\nI am not a lawyer, therefore it's not possible for me to locate or interpret the outcomes of the SEC's past regulation through enforcement actions. Such legal documents are not easy for a layperson (like me) to access nor understand.\n\nFor my protection, I really just need to know which cryptocurrencies are securities. As a naive investor, this is important to help me avoid a situation where the SEC might regulate through enforcement at any moment thereby harming my chosen investment (yet allowing others to trade unrestricted).\n\nCan you please run through the top 50 market cap cryptocurrencies and simply let me know which ones are securities (and which are not)?\n\nAn easy to read table or spreadsheet will suffice. I can't find this on your website at the moment.\n\nWithout this critical information from the SEC, I am unable to safely invest in this new asset class.\n\nPlease help protect me.\n\nThank you kindly.\n\"",

So if you issued your own NFT then others don\u2019t need support for it on a centralized exchange. People can trade it directly on XRPL\u2019s DEX via some UI access point such as [xrptoolkit.com](https://www.xrptoolkit.com)\n\nI would highly suggest going over documentation on [XRPL.org](https://xrpl.org) to gain a better understanding of the ledger.

If nothing good you can send the tokens back to the issuer/ sell them and close the trustline.\n\nAnd never fill in any registration form for airdrops that asks for your real identity, passwords, secrets, etc.",

I\u2019ve been into crypto for 5 years now (xrp being my main focus for the entirety) and can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t come across this, and of course he has now stopped blogging. At least there is still a big archive to read through and a lot of still relevant concerns/FUD that have been echoed over the years have been explained in great detail. This will be my go to for anyone who asks me questions regarding concerns about xrp. Can\u2019t thank you enough for sharing this, this is by far the best source of xrp related info I have yet to come across. Probably one of the most valuable things I\u2019ve gotten from this sub so far. I really hope he continues blogging in the future. Thanks again for sharing this!!!",

Ripples On demand liquidity (ODL) product allows banks, remittance companies, and multinationals institutions to settle funds nearly instantly using the digital currency XRP. XRP, the native told to the XRP ledger (XRPL) is highly scalable, fast (under 10 seconds), cheap (flat fee of around $0.00002), and environmentally friendly (more so than the legacy financial system even). \n\n2. Ripple is creating a network aiming to rival/replace the Swift system. Settling funds in the legacy financial system takes days to process, during which time the exchange rates between fiat currencies is often much more volatile than settling with XRP (used as a bridge currency). This gives the end user instant access to their funds in their chosen fiat currency for much less. CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently spoke in the future of money conference in Saudi Arabia stating that they are aiming to reduce the remittance cost from 600 basis points (6% fee) to 60 basis points (0.6% fee). This can make a huge difference for a low wage worker sending money back to their family. Lol I might be biased, but idk what the cons are for the end user. I think there are regulatory hurdles that are preventing a lot of institutions from using the product (notably in the US and India which are remittance hot zones). \n\n3. Use of ODL has increased 25x YoY, that\u2019s with the SEC lawsuit holding it back. I think they know what they need to do to keep growing. My guess would be lobby governments more to get the regulatory green light, and continue developing new and existing payment corridors. As for the diversifying question, Brad spoke about this in his \u201cpeanut butter manifesto\u201d where he said a company really needs to develop a single product to the point of being ahead of any competition and able to maintain their lead in it, before working on other products or use cases. Saying a company doesn\u2019t want to spread itself too thin and be average in a bunch of different things. That being said, they have spoken about receiving feedback from their customers about other products or features they\u2019d like to see. \nOn a side note, there are many developers building on the XRP ledger, constantly bringing new use cases and different products. David Schwartz is the CTO at Ripple and co-creator of the XRPL and has spoken about how XRP would be great for use in NFT\u2019s (though I don\u2019t believe this is something Ripple is actively building on)",

Continue it's partnership with bank networks to increase market share by creating competitive disadvantage for banks not using them. Their cost is so much lower than the traditional system that if they do not use it, competitors will need to develop their own  digital value solutions. SBI is already implementing XRP into other aspects of financing besides remittances. Ripple should continue to develop turn key product offerings that can then be sold to banks as plugins.

Scarcity of XRP in any corridor is the death of ODL. Ripple uses the escrow as lender of last resorts should there not be enough XRP to keep an ODL corridor at a maximum flow. It's important to say this is not the only use of the escrow as excanges and institutional sales also happen from the escrow. Right now there are only 5 ODL corridors. The Escrow will allow the corridors to grow until utility takes over and XRP is more widely adopted.\n\nI am of the mind set that a burn will never happen unless its required to settle by the SEC.\n\nThink about this: https://i.imgur.com/vleppnV.png",

As you mention, the judgement on fair notice would probably be the catalyst, as the SEC won't want it to go to summary judgement as then it could become case law and damage them permanently. Even when going against cryptos that probably are securities (such as exchange coins). I'd expect her to make a ruling on that by mid December, as that then gives the SEC the 30 days needed to answer the interrogatories relating to fair notice before discovery ends.\n\n  \nI also think more broadly the SEC will want to settle before it gets to filing arguments for summary judgement (around February / March), as that is the point at which Ripple can include all kinds of documents as evidence, which will be visible to the public. Just by having that information out there could damage the SEC / give fuel for future defendants, or even cause a scandal if strong indication of bad action by Hinman & Clayton (with Joe Lubin's help).\n\n  \nThere's also the possibility that there is some kind of earlier settlement/ agreement that current and/or non Ripple related XRP sales are not a security. The case /negotiations could then continue on to determine the status of historic / Ripple & co's sales (and whatever damages they might need to pay, or special actions they need to take for their future sales / escrow).",

Looks like they\u2019re going to give Gaaaary the broad, sweeping powers for which he\u2019s been lobbying. They had been pursuing a policy of regulation by enforcement, until they hit a wall with Ripple, a case that\u2019s not looking good for them. They know they\u2019re gonna lose at summary judgement, and the precedent will limit their ability to pursue regulation by enforcement in the future. So they turned to Congress, but it doesn\u2019t look like any legislation will be passed anytime soon. So now they\u2019re left with the desperation play of giving the SEC the power via executive fiat, which will save them from the damage they\u2019d incur from a loss to Ripple, and provide a temporary stop gap until Congress passes crypto regulation. This is good for us, because than the SEC will be incentivized to settle, since they\u2019d already have gotten the powers they hoped to gain via the Ripple action, and they wouldn\u2019t want to risk undermining that power with a loss to Ripple.

It definitely makes sense to try to understand and cultivate this inescapable evolution rather than trying to stamp it out. The approach being taken instead is the lazy approach, at best, and that is before considering the agendas pushing the approach. In the end, it\u2019s like trying to stamp out a fire being fueled by gasoline. You\u2019re just going to get gas on your boots and catch on fire yourself. It\u2019s not going away, and unfortunately America is only going to get left behind with this approach.",

I remember a (reserved) sigh of relief in the crypto space when he became the new SEC chair, because of his well documented excellent knowledge of crypto, and opiniated clear statements about it.\n\nBoth in this lawsuit and the SEC's inaction in the GME/AMC-cheating he seems to have all the executive power needed to _at least_ take concrete steps forwards towards protecting retail investors.\n\nIt baffles me that there seems to be no action, even doubling down their earlier stupidity. Stalling every inch of progress there can be made.\n\nPerhaps Gensler always already was like this and the favorable viewpoints he got from the community were unfounded. His (or his team's) tone deaf Twitter posts do make me worry this is the case..",

The fair notice defense seems valid in Ripple's case because there was no ICO, Ripple didn't create or issue XRP, technically they are sitting on a pile which makes it seem more like a commodity, and they develop software that utilizes the asset, like selling gas powered cars and you also happen to sell the gasoline because you inherited a bunch of it.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum and many others did have ICO's and sold what were effectively IOU's to help fund development of the cryptocurrency.

True.\n\nEspecially where you have video footage of Vitalik Buthole carrying on about early investors in the ICO being promised returns as the price of the coin increases... and how they will be funding the cost of development!

Ripple is using the fact that the SEC essentially gave ETH a green light as a non-security back in 2018. The reasons the SEC gave for this at the time was that ETH was decentralized enough that investors couldn't really be investing in a specific third party, which meant it wasn't a security. The judge ordered the SEC to hand over any internal documents regarding ETH's classification as a non-security to Ripple's attorneys because it's a key factor in the fair notice defense they're aiming for. The SEC handed them over almost 100% redacted. \n\nThe reason people think this date may be the end of the case is because when she reads the unredacted documents it's likely the judge will clearly see that the Ripple attorneys are correct and XRP will also be a non-security for the same reasons as ETH. That, or it will at least prove that Ripple can say the laws have been murky via the inconsistency of the SEC, which is exactly what the fair notice defense is about.\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg. The SEC picked the wrong company to go after. Ripple will absolutely win this case, just a matter of when.",

(Laughably false)\n\nAnd hence why the SEC is trying to state that Hinman's statements on ETH were his *opinion,* (despite **several** live segments of him on video stating that \"We (who is we other than the agency??) believe ETH to be decentralized enough to be a currency/utility.\" \n\nThe entire case is a fucking house of cards, the SEC knows this, which is why they are scrambling/withholding documents, etc.\n\nRipple has them by the balls and they know that if they lose this XRP creates a precedent and they'll have an extremely hard time going after *any* crypto. Hell they were basically begging the judge and \"warning\" that if they lose it will have a catastrophic affect on their ability to go after *any* crypto. They just went after the wrong horse, as I do think the space is ripe with fraud, but going after the one crypto that arguably has more utility nor held a ICO, (other than a store of value) is bizarre and ripe with corruption.",

Bitstamp USD is more liquid than GateHub USD on the DEX, so that's going to get you the better rate. Plus it sounds like you already have a Bitstamp account, which you'll need in order to withdraw the money. You can also use [Sologenic](https://sologenic.org/trade?market=XRP%2FUSD%2BrvYAfWj5gh67oV6fW32ZzP3Aw4Eubs59B) to do the same thing.\n\n2) Yes you can, and this is what I do. Just set the Bitstamp USD trust line to your self-custodial account and place an order. Then you can send the USD to your Bitstamp account where it arrives as a regular USD balance that you can withdraw to your bank.\n\n3) Compared to most exchanges, the liquidity is relatively low on the DEX. But generally speaking, it's high enough that you'll get a good rate. Also tbh, I think a lot of people just don't understand how it works.",

The exchange looks cool, volume a little low, but I'm going to register.\n\nRegarding 1-2: would you be so kind to walk through the following: I'm on Bitstamp right now and do not see an XRP/USD pair. As I understand it this transaction would take place on the XRP DEX, completely independent of Bitstamp. After the trade fulfills I then have some type of USD IOU in my Xrptoolkit trusted assets balance that I then send to my Bitstamp wallet address. What is my Bitstamp wallet is actual fiat representation at which point it's up to me to ACH to my bank account I assume. In this manner Bitstamp didn't trade xrp, is compliant with the trade suspension, etc. \n\nAssuming the above is in the ballpark of correct, what's in it for Bitstamp?\n\n(I need to look into the DEX mechanics I suppose)\n\nThanks for entertaining the questions.",

So it's not being held on XRP Toolkit, but in your wallet. XRP Toolkit is just a handy UI which allows you to easily perform these kind of transactions (like Sologenic). \n\nBitstamp issues these USD tokens/IOUs which are fully backed 1:1 for redemption. Anybody can trade their IOUs on the DEX and hold in their wallet, but need a Bitstamp account to withdraw. Bitstamp makes money on this because every transaction with their IOUs net them a 0.2% fee. After you acquire the USD in your XRP wallet, you can you send it to your personal Bitstamp account.\n\nTo find the correct address to which you need send the USD on Bitstamp, click \"Deposit\" on the top right, then \"IOU (BTC, USD).\" This will show you an XRP address and Destination Tag to which you send the USD. Make sure to include the Destination Tag, and make sure not to send XRP itself to this address. Once you send the USD to this address, then when you log into Bitstamp, you'll see a regular USD balance which you can use to trade on the exchange or withdraw to your bank via ACH.",

In contrast, Quintenz's new statement  in response to Gensler's seems a breath of fresh air, that pushes against the flack Gensler spouted.  It is reminiscent of  the saying by Judge Brandeis in the Judge's referencing \"Sunlight as being the best Disinfectant\".  Quintenz' comments DO actually seem to clarify the problem the SEC has recently had over \"what constitutes a commodity\" &/or \"what constitutes a security\". Maybe all that was needed was Quinterez' apt views on this matter.",

                    "response": "The future of XRP is **On Demand Liquidity**. ODL is why XRP can do cross boarder settlement and remittance efficiently and fast. Scarcity of XRP in any corridor is the death of ODL. Ripple uses the escrow as lender of last resorts should there not be enough XRP to keep an ODL corridor at a maximum flow. It's important to say this is not the only use of the escrow as excanges and institutional sales also happen from the escrow. Right now there are only 5 ODL corridors. The Escrow will allow the corridors to grow until utility takes over and XRP is more widely adopted.\n\nI am of the mind set that a burn will never happen unless its required to settle by the SEC.\n\nThink about this: https://i.imgur.com/vleppnV.png",

Bitstamp USD is more liquid than GateHub USD on the DEX, so that's going to get you the better rate. Plus it sounds like you already have a Bitstamp account, which you'll need in order to withdraw the money. You can also use [Sologenic](https://sologenic.org/trade?market=XRP%2FUSD%2BrvYAfWj5gh67oV6fW32ZzP3Aw4Eubs59B) to do the same thing.\n\n2) Yes you can, and this is what I do. Just set the Bitstamp USD trust line to your self-custodial account and place an order. Then you can send the USD to your Bitstamp account where it arrives as a regular USD balance that you can withdraw to your bank.\n\n3) Compared to most exchanges, the liquidity is relatively low on the DEX. But generally speaking, it's high enough that you'll get a good rate. Also tbh, I think a lot of people just don't understand how it works.",

I established two trustlines, XRP/USD (Bitstamp) being one of them as I do have an active account. \n\nI do have a few more 'dumb' questions about this process so please bear with me if you have the time. \n\nI have never heard of the Sologenic DEX, and I assume Solo is their base token, like BNB is to Binance? The exchange looks cool, volume a little low, but I'm going to register.\n\nRegarding 1-2: would you be so kind to walk through the following: I'm on Bitstamp right now and do not see an XRP/USD pair. As I understand it this transaction would take place on the XRP DEX, completely independent of Bitstamp. After the trade fulfills I then have some type of USD IOU in my Xrptoolkit trusted assets balance that I then send to my Bitstamp wallet address. What is my Bitstamp wallet is actual fiat representation at which point it's up to me to ACH to my bank account I assume. In this manner Bitstamp didn't trade xrp, is compliant with the trade suspension, etc. \n\nAssuming the above is in the ballpark of correct, what's in it for Bitstamp?\n\n(I need to look into the DEX mechanics I suppose)\n\nThanks for entertaining the questions.",

So it's not being held on XRP Toolkit, but in your wallet. XRP Toolkit is just a handy UI which allows you to easily perform these kind of transactions (like Sologenic). \n\nBitstamp issues these USD tokens/IOUs which are fully backed 1:1 for redemption. Anybody can trade their IOUs on the DEX and hold in their wallet, but need a Bitstamp account to withdraw. Bitstamp makes money on this because every transaction with their IOUs net them a 0.2% fee. After you acquire the USD in your XRP wallet, you can you send it to your personal Bitstamp account.\n\nTo find the correct address to which you need send the USD on Bitstamp, click \"Deposit\" on the top right, then \"IOU (BTC, USD).\" This will show you an XRP address and Destination Tag to which you send the USD. Make sure to include the Destination Tag, and make sure not to send XRP itself to this address. Once you send the USD to this address, then when you log into Bitstamp, you'll see a regular USD balance which you can use to trade on the exchange or withdraw to your bank via ACH.",

Once you've confirmed you're able to access the account using XUMM, you can uninstall the old software on the PC. \n\nYes to the second question as well. You want to keep it offline exactly because it could be compromised somehow. As you'll soon see when you import the account into XUMM, the private key is all that's needed to gain access. Doesn't matter what kind of password has been set up with the wallet software. Any password you set up on the software (PC or phone) only controls access to that particular software in which the account has already been imported. You can have the best password setup with XUMM or any other wallet, but one could still drain your account from the other side of the world with that secret key.",

Therefore, please research for the regulations applicable in your country or consult e.g. a tax attorney.\n\n[Edit] To answer your question: most tax agencies will be able to backtrace any profits once they are realized and will apply the normal fee plus a hefty fine for not properly handling ones taxes. Meaning if they catch you, you\u2019re most likely gonna pay a lot more than you would have just complying with tax regulations.\n\nHowever, as far as I know in most countries voluntary disclosure of said transactions with the responsible tax agency/body is often seen as mitigating circumstance and might benefit your case (meaning lower fines or no fines).",

I had no idea you'd see nothing on the device about exactly what you were authorizing. While I'd like to think I would not have fallen for this, I singled a transaction for the flare drop on the tool everyone is using to register, and I'm no longer comfortable with that. \n\nTo be clear, when you are supposed to sign on the tool, it does look as it should on the device and there was no send transaction beyond the signed message that gets you registered for the Spark drop, so they are evidently legit. From now on, I'll probably use only ledger live will only send to my exchange address(with tag) or my XUMM app and then from there to any other king of transaction, just to be that much more cautious.\n\n@OP, sorry this happened to you. Thank you for posting about it to warn everyone.",

Yesterday was an off day (sleep deprived mum) and genuinely I don\u2019t receive any other email next to ripple insights. The website looked the same. And the mistake I made. With all the airdrops etc going on I just thought, let me quickly do this and do the other things. With spark I looked it all up and checked several sources. It is very stupid and I am quite distressed that the one time neglecting due diligence has an outfall like this.\nBut I came to understand that my case is linked to hundreds and if it can happen to a normal sensible person I just want to make others aware again. Or advice and remind their friends.\nI know I will get slack for the stupidity but I hope someone reading it will less alone as my initial thought was embarrassment and fear of judgement. And that is doesn\u2019t happen to newbies but to someone who did it for years and normally does do the checks.",

Keep your XRP on your Ledger Nano and use [https://flare.wietse.com/](https://flare.wietse.com/) to set it up so you can receive spark tokens.\n\n2. Move your XRP to an exchange that supports the airdrop. A list of supporting exchanges can be found on Flare's website: [https://flare.ghost.io/](https://flare.ghost.io/)  \n\n\nGl man. There's a ton of content on Youtube explaining what Spark Tokens and Flare are but in short: Flare is bringing Smart Contract technology to tokens that currently can't support it (ie non-turing complete tokens). They are starting with XRP. This will allow XRP to have DeFi capabilities. Spark Tokens are governance tokens; other examples of Governance tokens are Maker (MKR). MKR is to DAI what Spark is to XRP in this case. Spark will not be replacing XRP. Spark holders can thus vote on certain changes on the blockchain as each token represents 1 vote. A lot of potential imo.",

Please try not too blame yourself too much, as hindsight is always 20/20. Dwelling and fixating on what you should/shouldn't have done is completely pointless.\n\nGiven the convincing extension and the mental fog caused by your underlying stress and illness, I feel like plenty of others in your situation would've wound up in the same spot. I'm glad to hear your husband has been supportive. He has a point that it's just money. While it took a while to earn, that money **can** be earned back. Focus on your health and navigating these very uncertain times with your husband.\n\nHope you have a speedy recovery!",

I gotta wonder, has Ripple responded to this OR willing to do anything about it? Ripple endorses GateHub and handed the keys to the wallet business some time ago.\n\nLet's be clear, I'm not at all saying Ripple SHOULD take responsibility. Merely wondering if they'd be willing to offer some recompense or possibly remove their endorsement. In other words, what are the ramifications of this, if any, to Ripple or because of their \"promotion\" of GateHub.\n\nI'm fully aware of the history of how GateHub came to be after the FinCEN fine. I firmly believe we are all responsible for our own coins. I don't believe Ripple owes anyone anything. I don't know how to feel about GateHub \"owing\". Mt.Gox is on the hook for paying back funds, should GH be? I dunno, not my place to say.\n\nHope Ripple, GH, and the community come out of this okay.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry to anyone who lost on this including GH who may lose their reputation. GH is afterall a direct line to the Ledger and serves a far greater purpose than a wallet.\n\nThis post is seeking information and conversation, not placing blame anywhere. All involved have lost in some way. Solutions and the future matter now. If that wasn't clear before, it is now :p",

Normally I just use coinbase. The sale of xrp costs literally 0.5% (cheaper than spend). That\u2019s it the rest is free. Free deposit straight to PayPal, Just use my PayPal debit card. Also wirex is the cheapest of all three ( so I\u2019ve seen never used it personally not in the US yet) \n\nAlso I use coin payments or Coinbase Commerce a lot.

Needless to say, development slowed down a ton.  Typically, there's a huge crossover between the people who develop the protocol and the people who develop the wallet, since you need an intimate knowledge of the protocol to build a wallet, but in this case, due to the FinCEN rulling, there was a large wall between the two groups.\n\nHonestly, if I were to guess, I think a large part of xpring is to incentivize, and clear out barriers for, the community to build tools to support the network that Ripple themselves are not allowed to build.  That's why you have people like Weiste Wind being funded, so they can just go off and build cool XRP tools, without having to worry about a day job.",

Made the same trade myself tons of times. Except, used eth. Binance now offers direct xrp purchases tho using a card. May look into that in the future.\n\nAs for storing that small amount, dont purchase a hardware wallet. Not going to be worth it. Toast wallet is a mobile app. Works great for me. That is until i got to a point i felt uncomfortable having a huge amount on it. Mobile \u201chot\u201d wallets arent the most secure. But for most purposes are secure enough. \n\nOnce you get a few thousand dollars worth of crypto consider a cold wallet, like a ledger nano\n\nBut make sure you understand how to use it, test it by sending a small amount and also test sending it off the wallet before you commit to storing all of it on there. This is true for any new wallet.  ",

Frustrating talking to people who follow their emotions rather than fact, sometimes you just can't change minds when they don't want to be. \n\nI honestly don't get the tribalism. Cryptocurrency isn't a competition, there are uses far beyond payments; from medical to real estate and more. The irony is, the tribalism is actively playing a role in *suppressing* adoption. Ripples success means the success of Blockchain; and there's a lot of tokens that can solve issues Ripple isn't focused on. While theoretically with Coil & Codius it can solve more than just the transfer of value, Ripple is focused on that. \n\nBrad has mentioned, which I agree with, the biggest issue with most cryptocurrency is they don't have a clear focus or vision. Even ConsenSys describe themselves as:\n\n>ConsenSys is solving real-world problems with Ethereum blockchain solutions for organizations of all sizes, from the local community to the global enterprise.\n\nTo me that's incredibly vague... \n\nAnd they are going through layoffs and \"restructuring;\" Joe Lubin admitted they scaled too fast without a clear focus. Instead of setting out to solve one problem, they set out to solve \"every\" problem. But when Blockchain is in such an infant state where it's struggling for legitimately providing use, the community is just fighting over which is better. You could tell in Brad's last AMA his prediction that institutional adoption didn't come in 2018; and you could tell a lot of his frustration was because of the immaturity of the community was actively a reason for causing it to be stifled.\n\nCompletely different sector but I remember when the Rift and Vive came out it was a \"which is better,\" now that it's becoming more poplar generally both communities get along. VRs relative success is because *both* companies, while in competition they realized they *had* to play nice. Cross platform is the largest reason for adoption imo; likely we wouldn't have PSVR without the Rift or Vive. Now the industry is more about the adoption of VR, not which hardware is better. There's PLENTY of room for multiple players.\n\nI welcome and hope many other tokens survive, but I fully agree PoW is going to fail. It's had over a decade and has only proved slow, inefficient, expensive and damaging to the environment. PoS and PoC are what will lead to adoption. ETH is scrambling to move to PoS.",

Talked about Ripple and got some upvotes and a crypto naysayer. I'm curious, as crypto flies under the public radar, how this will all unravel. Sure, the public may not know they are using crypto, but what awesome changes will bear fruit when money is moving seamlessly? Should be fun. It'll be interesting no doubt. Cheers.",

I wanted to query payment volume by date but I cannot find any field related to date in the transactions table. Maybe it should be joined with the ledgers table to obtain this piece of information?\n\nI guess it would be quite interesting for the community to have an insight into NVT ratio ( Network Valuation divided by the Transaction Value) for XRP ([http://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-nvt-signal/](http://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-nvt-signal/)).\n\nThere is a website [https://coinmetrics.io/nvt/#assets=btc](https://coinmetrics.io/nvt/#assets=btc) which can be used to get the ratio for a number of assets but in case of XRP the details of txVolume are incomplete.\n\nAlso [https://xrpcharts.ripple.com/#/history](https://xrpcharts.ripple.com/#/history) shows strange data.\n\nAny XRP ledger explorer willing to help? :)",

For amateur investors, my recommendation in the middle of a panic sell is to hold.  It's too easy to fall prey to what could be intentional manipulation and lose 'your units.'  \n\nThose that short and manipulate have one overriding goal in mind; not necessarily to increase the dollar value of their cryptos, but to increase the number of units they own.  \n\nIf you simply refuse to sell, then you retain your units and 'live to trade another day.'  \n\nBut that's more advice than my commentary on the cause.  I think there's a combination of reasons, but I honestly think this started with investor disgust at infighting and forking and tribalism.  I also think, generally, the market will eventually turn away from POW as a validation mechanism - it is simply unsustainable from an environmental standpoint, no matter the amazing apologetics you read from some authors.

I mean guy who combines news and serve them in a simple way. But his prediction... Hodor predicted 1 trillion marcet cap in 2018 for XRP :)) This one is another not so clever thing. It is a nature of crypto to go up and down heavily. You probably know the reason why. I can explain but not in this post it will take time :) It will be changed when we see heavy regulations. But it will not happen on the next wave. I strictly recommend to Hodor stay way from such predictions. It will not add trust and value to his articles.",

I think when we consistently break that level, we'll be on our way.  And in style.  \n\nAt that point, I think word should've gotten around about its performance metrics and the other facts that Bitcoin maxis don't want the general public to know.  \n\n> Your posts are mainly praises that prop xrp up (not that it needs it)\n\nMy posts are not to 'prop' it up, but to counter the large-scale misinformation campaigns that are consistently waged by miners and Bitcoin maximalists to try and get the public to believe that wasteful proof-of-work is the *only* way to validate transactions in a decentralized manner.  That is simply not the case, but you can see firsthand how much success they've had in trying to brainwash the public using sloganism, silly memes, and ad-hominem attacks on any person that would suggest otherwise.  \n\n*That* is why I'm writing.  (in addition to the fact that 95% of my investments in crypto are in XRP \ud83d\ude05 )  I've seen that behavior since 2013 and it bothers me.  \n\n> Right now all we can do is comment on each individual domino falling before it reaches that last critical piece that branches the paths off. And I assume the entire world will be in a sudo chaos from the sheer amount of possibilities that xrp/codius brings to the table.

SBI/MG are not doing well in the competition ranking.\n\nSame applies to the JPY-THB.\n\nIt is quite surprising to see Worldremit and transferwise right up there. Worldremit's cost % is 1.38 (pretty impressive) and transferwise is 3.17%\n\nSBI/MG's current cost % is 6.07!!!\n\nSo in theory if they utilise Xrapid with savings of 70% this 6.07 can be dropped to 1.8% (I can only work on the percentages as I dont have any more data).\n\nThat leap frogs transferwise and pretty much level pegged with worldremit.\n\nNow worldremit is only an internet based remittance service whereas SBI are a physical bank where you can transfer money using their remit card on any ATM direct to their home country!\n\nNow that is groundbreaking for SBI.

You're part of a revolution and this is the perfect time to stock up!\n\nI would reccomend a few things about xrp and  crypto in general:\n\n1) READ and Research! You need to learn about the tech you are invested in! There are a few good ways to start. We have trusted community bloggers that have all the info that you need. Check out our community page at https://xrpcommunity.blog/\n\nI reccomend Hodor's blog. He has a great history of XRP on his wordpress site. I also reccomend galgitron's blog. He is funny and will tell you up front what is bullshit about crypto. Cant go wrong with research! \n\nThere are also youtube channels about XRP. I reccomend Alex Cobb! He is a young kid that quit school just to research XRP. His videos can be a little hyped up, but nothing compared to all the other channels. I am a moderator for his channel. He does daily live streams with news. If you ask any question on there, he will answer it live on his show! He records at 10:30 Pacific time.\n\n2) dont invest more that you can stand losing. \nOf course you dont want to lose any money, but think rationally. DO YOU NEED THIS MONEY TO EAT OR PAY RENT? DO YOU HAVE UNCONTROLLED DEBT? \n\nIf you answered yes, then dont invest at all. This is not a get rich scheme no matter how much we joke about it on here. You wont be a millionaire in 5 years... maybe 10, but probably not. Invest what you dont need and be happy with your decision based in your research.\n\n3) Hold! Never day trade! People lose their ashes by day trading. You get emotional about your money and the market gets the best of you. There are soulless people that dont care about your feelings and will manipulate the market to prompt you to buy or sell at the wrong time. Just hold, because we know for a fact that the profit will come in a few years time. Also, it easier for tax reasons. The taxes are far less for holdings over a year. \n\n4) Get involved! I'm glad you want to run a codius host! Use the Coil Medium blog to guide you through the process. If you get stuck, try sending a tweet to @wietsewind or @JustMoon they are developers who build a lot of software on ledger. They can help.\n\nAlso, make an XRP Chat account. There is a whole forum with subforums that get really specific on information about XRP. Reddit is great... but it's more of a news outlet than community info.... sorry r/Ripple. \n\nGo to XRP Chat and join the Zerpening club! We are on 24/7 and share news as it comes out. We also joke a lot about everything. Good times to be had there my friend. I'm @mattwayne_c, look for me sometime!\n\nWelcome to the community!",

We like to support exchanges that do this. Local Ethereum is obviously an Ethereum based exchange, and while you can purchase XRP this way, its not the fastest or easiest and also does less to encourage XRP as the base crypto.",

                    "response": ">On the face of it, that makes XRP a security\n\nI've been working with this concept in my head. If XRP is a security than so is ETH based on ConsenSys and so is any other crypto with an organization backing it. If the business of that organization affects the price of the crypto in any way that makes it a security by this arguments standards. You could easily say that ETH price climbs because of the work done by ConsenSys or that positive ConsenSys business makes the price go up. Updating to Lightning Network or Casper or any business anouncing a DApp are all manipulators of the ETH network causing a \"dividend\" increase. Are you investing in the Loom Network business by holding ETH? By holding an ERC20 Token? If XRP ends up being considered a security, so should the others.\n\nPersonally, I think this is an easy determination and it is absolutely false to say XRP is a security. Mostly because it isn't tied to Ripple the same way stock is tied to a business (ie. not % of company value, no say in company decisions, no real dividend return, business capital isn't spent issuing or buying back).\n\nWhat do you guys think about this track of thinking?",

Grab's operation is exactly like Uber's private car ride sharing, but with additional choices of booking a taxi, a delivery service, a bike, etc. \n\nThere's rumor that Uber is looking at selling its South East Asian operations to Grab in exchange for a stake in the company as well.",

Regarding the connection btc/xrp I think as we approach end of the year xrp will further close gap with btc as we increase overall market exposure, right now whole market is in bear cycle and that can last for months or even more, one example of bear market was period between Nov13 - Feb15 after reaching ath just above 1k btc crashed and we entered bear market that lasted \u205314months reaching bottom at 192,00$ then it took couple of months to consolidate around 220$ before the next run. So if you take market behaviour in consideration I think in a couple of months will start to see difference in performance in top 10 as more institutional money floods the market. As we recover, Ripple will be on top of the next wave when markets breaks 1trl cap and that should be our final divorce from btc. \nLet me know your thoughts. \n\nCheers  \n",

Do you think XRP is going to have a giant breakout with all of this built up at the right time, or a gradual break away from BTC etc?\n\nthanks as always and hopefully leading into Spring we will see some better results!",

Yes, there have been clear indications of that breakaway.  Am I going to spend a half hour looking for examples to support that point?  No.  If you've been tracking XRP price every other hour like me, you will know about these times.  (and I say that in all good humor on a 'red' day)\n\nYou put your #2 point underneath the heading \"You claim in the article\" but I actually make no claim that there is a direct correlation between good news for XRP and the price of XRP.  As you point out, the price has declined even with the massive amount of incredible news over the last four days.  This is due to the fact that XRP is *still* primarily coupled with BTC price behavior.  \n\nThe reason for this coupling has to do with the volume that BTC has compared to XRP.  Once that trend starts to invert on occasion, we will see a de-coupling.  I predict that this will happen irrevocably when xRapid demand makes itself known, which is why I'm tracking xRapid partnerships so closely.  \n\nNo, it will not be a gradual breakout.  It will be sudden and violent, and you will know it when you see it; think December 2017 when XRP diverged in a big way, and went up to half the market cap of Bitcoin.  \n\nI understand your frustration.  My advice?  HODL\n\nThis crypto 2.0! Holders get rich.  Day traders who try to play the XRP waves get rekt.  I've only seen a *tiny* handful of skilled day traders be able to grow their XRP stash by playing the waves.  \n\nThank you for reading and commenting! \n\n",

I could really do with hearing some news as to why I should not sell and get some of the money back.\n\nCrypto is rife with stories about people who are in the same spot as you.  If you think you are the only one in that predicament, you are absolutely mistaken!  This is why the SEC is getting involved in crypto - there are unregulated ICOs that are willing to directly steal from people.  \n\nIf you purchased XRP, you did the absolutely smartest thing you could in my opinion - XRP has the biggest use case of all the digital asset options out there.  And it is championed by a company - Ripple - who's business is built around the use of its digital asset.  \n\nRe: Price behavior.  In the short term, people have identified one major reason from the Bitcoin crash in value that is bringing down the entire market - it seems to be related to the sale of bankruptcy proceeds from the Mt. Gox sale of Bitcoin.  I cover this in the first part of my blog.  \n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-traders-angry-over-mt-gox-trustees-bitcoin-sales-2018-3\n\nMy point is this:  Ripple can't control Bitcoin's temporary dominance of crypto price behavior.  But they keep on rolling, focusing on XRP adoption at a mass scale - and its working!  \nNote that it hasn't decoupled with BTC yet, so we have to look to BTC price behavior, at least in the short term, to predict what will happen.  And no, it's not good; yes, it's depressing.  \nBut keep in mind that if you're studying Bitcoin, even there mathematics is on your side - the limited supply will necessarily result in Bitcoin's continued climb upwards - and it will happen in 2018.  \nBut by then, I predict that XRP may have \"made some serious moves\" anyway.  We will see.  \n\nAs always, do your own research, and keep in mind that I'm just a blogger and not an expert.  (all the caveats on the home page of my blog)  \n\n\n\n\n",

I got into trading BTC back in 2013 and every time I wanted to purchase anything other than BTC it was a struggle.  I remember trying to move money using a variety of methods and it was always annoying.  \n\nHowever, now we see the new trend - exchanges are opting to go the XRP route because of its fast transfer speeds, and the new fiat pairings are starting to include XRP.  It used to be limited to Bitstamp, but now it includes a number of other exchanges as well such as Kraken and Gatehub, and it looks like Japanese exchanges will support direct fiat - XRP exchanges as well, such as SBI Virtual Currencies.  \n\nTraders like convenience and speed!

Theoretically, if usage does increase x100 it doesn't mean that the price will, the value being transferred across the network also matters. If there are x100 more people using the network and traffic sees a surge but they only send $10 a month is insignificant vs. institutions maybe making 1% as many transfers, but they are all millions in size then that will have a much more significant effect on price.\n\nAlso, my main point is that the whole objective of XRP is for use of institutional clients and banks/as a background bridge currency to remove need for nostro/vostro. Your average client that may benefit greatly from the product will never even know what XRP is or that it is being used.",

Just like the average person doesn't know the details about the software that VISA and Mastercard use to move money at the moment.  \n\n \nBut, another way to look at my stats is the following:  \n\n\nLet's say that Ripple/XRP currently \"powers\" transactions that involve moving money from person A to person B for 0.00039 % of all people on the planet. What if that becomes 0.0039% or 0.039% in the near future? Won't that push the price upwards?  \n\n\nYou make a good point, that 1 bank sending 1 billion is more important than 100 million people sending a dollar. However, at the end of the day, banks serve clients, either individuals or businesses. But the more people who have accounts, the more value is likely to be sent/received. Same goes for banks of course. The equivalent for the internet would be that the more home internet connections that exist, the more data is sent and received.   \n\nSure, the impact of a telecoms giant entering a market on total data usage would be more significant than 100.000 people signing up for a new connection, but at the end of the day, the user sends and receives the data. \nRegarding the X100 usage increase, it could also be argued that much less would be needed because growth is exponential, if I open a blockchain wallet I might tell to 5 friends but if they open one 6 months later they may tell it to 15 friends each.  \n\nIn conclusion, of course in the short-term FI adoption is massively more important for the price than the number of wallets.\nBut I do think a few years down the road everyone will have a bitcoin/XRP/Ethereum address, just like they didn't have a mobile number and now they have or they didn't have a Facebook account and now they have, or even a bank account for that matter.   \n\nIf \"the others\" have it, you \"need to have it too\". \nAnd also, don't forget that 2 billion people globally don't have a bank account and think about how easy is it is to set up a crypto wallet compared to a bank account.   \n\n\nThe implications of this are massive, many people already talk of blockchain as \"banking for the unbanked\".",

I would suggest Toast Wallet it's what I found to be pretty simple and very reliable.

If you\u2019re serious about accumulating long term wealth, in reality, another year is nothing, and one would only look at it as further opportunity to accumulate more XRP under favorable circumstances with the way the lawsuit is going. \n\nSome may have reached their own goals, or their own amount of total money they were willing to invest in the project. To each their own, if you have an investment strategy that you are confident in, then see it through. \n\nA year is the maximum amount of time this can drag out for at this point. The finish line is in sight, and it\u2019s very possible a settlement will happen before then. The SEC is not the favorite at this point. I never thought they were, I knew from day one they had a meritless lawsuit. If the judge was at all objective, XRP would come out on top. \n\nSo think for the long term, detach from the daily events, the daily price swings, and stay confident in the fundamentals. I never think that you can have to much of something that is valuable, so to me, I will keep accumulating when I get the opportunity. Remember there is more to life than crypto, and more to life than money. The only caveat is having money may allow you to truly experience everything else there is to offer, at least to the point where you don\u2019t have to be a wage slave for half of your waking hours every week.\n\nIt\u2019s coming ;)",

Playing the long game sometimes takes\u2026a long time. When you have corrupt government agencies literally trying to game the system they created in the first place, it can throw a wrench in the mix, but for the investor who is absolutely serious in accumulating as much as he can, based on what he believes the fundamental price is, and will be in the future, then it is simply more time to accumulate. \n\nI would highly recommend throwing your entire life to the side, and just grind and hustle to make as much money as literally possible in whatever given situation you are in, that\u2019s what I did, and it worked in a whole lot of ways. It\u2019s not always practical, it is unsustainable, and most importantly it will drive your mental health into the dirt. There are more things to life than just having money. Drug addiction is entirely possible while finding ways to continue. \n\nBut could financial independence bring you the ability to focus on other things in life besides money, could it give you the freedom to truly enjoy what the world has to offer? I believe so. I believe not having to spend any time at all worrying about money is a life where you can truly enjoy everything there is to offer. I have a lifestyle I want to live, that I believe will make me happy, and I\u2019m going to chase after it. \n\nI\u2019ve been retired from the insane 70+ hour weeks, no days off for almost a year now. I was forced to be, ironically. 3 years after starting out with nothing, I bought my 2021 civic type R brand new from the dealership, and someone rear ended me at a stoplight doing 40mph within the same week that I bought it. I tried to actually continue working, but I had been whiplashed and got a concussion, which forced me to take months off of work, and am actually just starting to round the corner to the finish line on being completely recovered. \n\nWithin that time, I got married, met my wife, and was basically forced to take a complete hiatus from my old lifestyle. I invested all of my time into a relationship, something I hadn\u2019t done or even thought about doing for years because I was so hell bent on getting every bit of crypto I could. I learned there is far more to life than just grinding and hustling, and that relationships have unequivocal value. \n\nIf xrp is still at a bargain when I receive an insurance payout, I will be taking a large portion of it and investing it. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t drag out that far and everyone who has held this long will be rewarded handsomely very soon, but if not, I\u2019ll just have a couple more carry on items for the spaceship before it launches ;) \n\nStay wealthy my friends",

Not sure why he refers to the defendants as Homer and Willy? The numerous claims he raises (while true) span years and involve so many parties- the discovery phase alone will be a nightmare. This could end badly and hurt future cases if he doesn\u2019t get assistance. I can\u2019t imagine him doing well against the law team that Hinman and Clayton put together unfortunately.",

Case in point, SEC submits a SWORN AFFIDAVIT from Hinman in support of his contention that the Ethereum \u201cfree pass speech\u201d was just his opinion. Than they later argue that the speech reflects the position of the SEC\u2019s Corporate Finance Division (which Hinman led), was meant to provide \u201cmarket guidance, and again support this contention with a SWORN AFFIDAVIT. A complete contradiction of their earlier claim. They are blatantly lying to the court, making a mockery of our judicial system and destroying the credibility of the SEC. Why?? The same reason that Clayton, Hinman and others left the SEC IMMEDIATELY after bringing the action against Ripple, and they all took jobs in the crypto industry, not coincidentally with Ethereum affiliated entities, knowing full well how unethical it would appear. The reason is that the amount of money at stake is so enormous that they are willing to sacrifice everything, their reputations, the integrity of our institutions, everything for a stake in this once in lifetime, multi generational wealth creating opportunity. So those are the stakes. For the winners, and by all accounts Ripple is winning this court case, granted not fast enough for our liking, but they are winning, the prize is wealth beyond your wildest imagination. And more importantly the freedom to live your life on your own terms, beholden to no man. Can you hold out for another month? Another year? I damn sure can. They\u2019ll never break me. They\u2019ll have to pry my XRP from my cold dying hand!",

I did just happen to read the new roadmap link from their twitter.. it seems they will have a governance update on token distribution. you still get the initial 15% read below and it makes sense. So im guessing from this the remaining spark tokens after the initial15% of tokens dropped will be voted on thru governance thru a proposal they have been working on. below is from their roadmap.\n\n(FL02: Governance Update On Token Distribution: The team has been working on a governance proposal regarding the token distribution. The proposal intends to achieve three things)\n\n(The governance vote for this proposal will only take place once 75% of the initial 15% distribution is freely available to take part in the governance vote. In the case of exchanges, this means that the token will have been distributed and can be withdrawn from the exchange. The proposal details will be published with ample advance warning before Flare launches.)",

There are countries, especially in Asia e.g. PRC, who yawn at the current sanctions and will continue doing business with Russia regardless: [https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/asian-buyers-russian-oil-gas-coal-2022-02-22/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/asian-buyers-russian-oil-gas-coal-2022-02-22/)\n\nSo what I'm saying is, today the markets are down, Russia gets cut from SWIFT, it's possible that for example BTC gets a massive boost, retail gets in on it and BTC brings everyone else up with it.\n\nThough if that happens, the media, governments and regulators will get plenty of ammo to exhibit why crypto is bad.",

Jesse Powell is in the first one and Chris Larsen is in the second, but Jed is a recipient of both. The first one essentially says that what Ripple is offering is a security, at which point Ripple revised their business plan and went back to the firm and the firm concluded that now it was NOT a security. I always wondered how the SEC got their hands on these legal memos which one would think would be protected by attorney client privilege\u2026unless a member of the team waived the privilege. Did Jed waive the privilege, and turn over the FIRST memo to the SEC, but not the SECOND memo, leading the SEC to mistakenly believe that Ripple had gone against the advise of their lawyers and sold an unregistered security??? \ud83e\udd14\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/filanlaw/status/1494821377701986304",

It sparked a quick conversation but I was surprised to hear he purchased some Bitcoin last year but never heard of any other crypto besides Ethereum. And that's the way it is with many of my friends and family. Smaller yet are the ones who actually hold any crypto at all.\n\nAnd I was there 4 years ago. I consider myself \"techy\" and had friends into mining Bitcoin but I had no interest in blockchains or cryptocurrency. Honestly I didn't even know there was a thing called alt-coins.\n\nIt wasn't until I had a double date that my buddy mentioned XRP and Ripple. It unearthed this mysterious market from what felt like right underneath me. Within 2 days I had done enough research to be convinced to get myself into XRP. \n\nMuch has changed since then. My attitude is more grounded and mature from \"moonboi\" to factual and intelligent conversations (although I still love cracking jokes). The crypto space has matured as well as it crawls its way into solving real-world problems. There is still a long road ahead, but the horizon is showing that blockchain will be part of our futures. Whatever crypto coin you hold, there is a little voice in the back of your head telling you that the crypto space is conforming into *something*. Oh, and to hodl, of course.\n\nI'm grateful that I'm here in this fucked up space with you fine lads. The short term looks dreary with the SEC lawsuit but Ripple hasn't skipped a beat executing it's objectives globally. Every country has their own set of rules/laws/regulations and there isn't a single other business remotely close to the global scale that Ripple has. They are playing chess with SWIFT and their pieces seem very well placed. \n\nI'll be damned if I had to look back at myself and wonder why I didn't hodl any XRP.",

Look at it from this perspective XRP has been around for many years and has always been a speculation coin of what its use case can do and now it has the chance to have clairty and move forward.. Without the SEC/Ripple lawsuit it for certain would have still been awating clairty for who knows how many years.\n\nDo you want a  $5.00 speculated price and hope to sell at the top or would you rather have clairtiy and real use with a stable price that can incrase for years to come?",

You would think it would have to give the exchanges a time frame in which to tidy up and also a basis for determining if the products they are offering are securities or not. Is Ripple/XRP that basis? Will the Howey test become the Ripple test? I don\u2019t think the case has even started to get anywhere close to upholding that type of standard. It would have to go through an extreme amount of scrutiny to be held up to that basis. That would take additional years. With all the money on the line, my guess would be that the executive order will simply say that the exchanges have to put extreme disclaimers on the front page of their sites and do advanced KYC. Then SEC/Ripple settles with some type of clarity saying that institutions won\u2019t be illegally using a product, Ripple and other legitimate companies continue to educate the powers that be to create a standard, and\u2026XRP moon.\nJust my wishful thinking.",

Look, we have over 17.5k cryptos in this space with no way for any country to regulate all of them. What makes sense in my mind is the US (and other countries) begin a green list of crypto currencies they see fit as \"safe\" or \"trusted\" enough while other cryptos are banned. \n\nThe executive order may induce fear because I doubt they will mention any \"good\" cryptocurrencies and it will probably \"paint us with a broad brush\" again.\n\nI think a crackdown is necessary - this market is oversaturated and it will help the few good cryptocurrencies to thrive, expand, and hopefully increase in value.",

Look, nobody knows how the SEC case will play out, but we\u2019ll have a pretty good idea within the next few days when a Judge Torres rules on the fair notice defense motion. If the SEC\u2019s position is weakened and they\u2019re forced to settle or drop the case (or lose the case at summary judgement), the upside for XRP\u2019s price will be INSANE. In fact, I think what we\u2019re seeing rt now is the market pricing in an SEC loss or settlement. If you have a little money you can afford lose, why not throw a cpl grand in? If the SEC wins you lose a cpl grand, but if they lose, the cpl grand turn into a 5 or 6 figure payday. Where else are you gonna get that kind of return on investment? Picking the next \u201cdoggy meme coin\u201d? Good luck with that!",

If the SEC are basing their arguments for significant prong tests of Howey on an internal email from Brad to staff and an email from Chris to an international XRP buyer.... then they're in trouble.\n\nThe general consensus was \"that's what the SEC fought to get submitted!!!\"... as in \"that's all they've got?\"",

I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re hearing all of this talk abt an executive order to try and bail them out. But that won\u2019t work. Imagine they try to say that all crypto are securities, and than they get bogged down in legal challenges abt the constitutionality of the order. Meanwhile Ethereum, their preferred crypto, gets labeled a security too, because they\u2019ve sworn under oath that the \u201cfree pass\u201d was just Hinman\u2019s opinion. So the playing field is leveled because all crypto is dead in the US, including Ethereum, and the rest of the world moves forward using Ripple who\u2019ve been quietly building their overseas business the whole time. That ain\u2019t gonna happen. I think the backup plan is to go after the exchanges. That way they can pick winners and losers by making the exchanges register and than telling them which cryptos they can or can\u2019t list. But that ain\u2019t gonna work either because decentralized exchanges will continue to thrive. The SEC screwed the pooch on this one",

I would have to totally agree with him.Many people are quite fooled in this space just throwing fiat into anything in hopes of making a buck and never even consider every project/idea is starting out as a funding project in big hopes of a use case. It has become so routine to think of a use case and test the waters and if it slightly works more projects will do the same in following suit to get their fair share of funding.\n\nRipple/XRP i will say actually has put forth a massive amount of effort and time over the years to position itself with a very good usecase and has kept true to its original plan. Sure they made changes thruout the years but still have the original use case End Goal in mind. There are also a few other older platforms/projects that have stayed laser focused as well with their original plans.\n\nWhat i don't like seeing is all this new type of trying to be creative on existing platforms trying to sell a use case when its all nothing more then disguised fundraising tactics. I'm saying all this because of whats happening on XRP/xrpl as well as other platforms getting ruined by these tactics. This gives Goverments or any other authority (SEC) reason to come in swinging the way they have reguarding. regulations. \n\nCZ's tweet.\n\n(Yield farming, transaction mining, airdrops are decent ways to jump start a project (attract an initial user base), but you still need to build real use cases. Otherwise, the project won't be sustainable in the long run.)",

We all know Ripple's legal team is impressive - but their core arguments against the SEC are pretty basic and the answers should be clear.\n\nThe fact that the SEC is tripping over their own words while providing vague and inconsistent remarks regarding their point of view on crypto currencies is unacceptable. This is your job, yet Gensler can't answer any questions.\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous. The whole thing just irritates me. \n\nI'm buying more xrp.",

The next 2 years I would continue buying all the way down but by the time it reached 0.30-0.32 I had met my goal. I was still buying but not large amounts.

We\u2019ve had a year or two of mainstream crypto advertisements, people are catching on that there\u2019s more out there than just BTC, institutions are starting to realize that there are many of these projects that are actually useful and beneficial. It\u2019s still the Wild West out there but the tracks being laid are almost complete. The trains are about to start rolling in. Maybe BTC is gold but the alts are about to be the nickels and dimes and twenties and hundreds that make the world go round. I\u2019m feeling positive.",
