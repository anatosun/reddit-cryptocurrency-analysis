            "selftext": "In an interview with CNBC last week, CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam discussed the CFTC and SEC's supervision of cryptocurrencies.\nThe chairman was asked for his thoughts on a plan in Congress that would place the Securities and Exchange Commission in control of security tokens and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission in charge of commodity tokens.\n\n\"This is a long-standing dispute between the CFTC and the SEC. We had a fantastic history together... Commodities should be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and securities should be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission,\" Behnam explained.\n\nSome currencies in the crypto world will be securities, while others will be commodities, according to the CFTC chairman.\n\nWhen asked about SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's contention that most crypto tokens are securities, Behnam emphasized that the most popular cryptocurrencies are commodities. He stressed:\n\nI can say with certainty that bitcoin... is a commodity As well as Ether \n\n I think regulation of Bitcoin could potentially be good or bad for the mainstream adoption of Cryptocurrencies.\nRegulation could help prevent scams and protect the interest of users, regulations would create a framework for investors to work with to further expand the growth of the ecosystem. Regulation would help accelerate the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. \n\nAlso one has to consider the blockchain ecosystem which continues to experience exponential growth by enabling the creation of innovative projects such as\nDecentraland  an online world that allows users to create their own avatars and purchase plots of virtual land, Planet Maya which is powered by champions games is  a decentralized and collaborative online casino which allows developers to build Games around betting, Luckyblock which  is a digital asset project that decentralizies the lottery process via blockchain technology and many more that could change how diverse industries operate from real estate, gaming, insurance, academia. The need for regulation increases as blockchain technology becomes more mainstream and becomes a part of different industries of human endeavour.\n\nI think it is quite ironic that a decentralized network should be subject to regulation by a central body but a much needed evil it Bitcoin is to become mainstream.\nRegulations could mean that Bitcoin is subject to the whims of these regulatory bodies making the decentralized network lose it's decentralized nature indirectly. It will be interesting to see how these regulatory bodies regulate Bitcoin. \n\n\nNews Source: \nhttps://news.bitcoin.com/cftc-chairman-confirms-bitcoin-ether-are-commodities/",

Then it lied about being 1:1 backed by *anything*. It has never had a proper audit. It is in bed with Blockstream. Its corporate leadership appears to be in hiding. Its issuance was incredibly suspiciously correlated with the BTC/BCH split. The dots don't need connecting. They are already touching.\n\nThis is the adversarial world of crypto, which works on the principle that that which cannot be verified must not be trusted, and which is supposed to be antagonistic to fiat money. But we're supposed to *trust* a company that's printing *unbacked fiat?!?* Dude. There is **no way** the old you would look at this as anything other than a guaranteed racket. What happened to you?",

At that point, mixing is mostly irrelevant. The problem is that we're still living in a world of intermediaries. Think in terms of fiat. You can censor at the bank, but you can't censor the flow of paper bills from peer to peer.\n\nBut to get there we have to end our dependence on intermediaries. The coin that becomes widely used as p2p cash will break through to the other side first.\n\nTo do that what is needed is widespread legal merchant adoption.  That means the 1st priority is scaling not privacy.\n\nA coin that's used in dnm but not legal business, and which has barriers to high volume scaling, has no chance of being that coin. IMO.\n\nIf I'm wrong and Monero becomes the coin that breaks the backs of intermediaries and becomes P2P cash for the world, I'll still be incredibly happy that our shared goals were achieved. That's why, although I don't participate in the Monero community, I'm still a supporter of the work being done there.",
