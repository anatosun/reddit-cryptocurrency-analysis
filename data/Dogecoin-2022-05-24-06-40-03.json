Doge has, or had last I checked, built-in coin creation mechanisms to  counter burning or hoarding to limit the supply.  \n\nUnlike Bitcoin style crypto meant to work like investments or gold, doge is more fiat in nature to make it more useful to the average person as a currency.\n\nTo get that high again a new major catalyst is needed.  Either a lot, I mean a lottt, of people jumping fast or the dollar crashing like the Rupee did last month.",
