When foreign countries quit sending us stuff because they don't want Dollars anymore, we got a problem. \nRussia has already traded oil with China for Yuan. Saudi Arabia looking to do something similar.  To answer your question, Yuan might be the next 'reserve' currency and that is frightening. I think there should multiple currencies we uses everyday with one not having much power over the other.",
