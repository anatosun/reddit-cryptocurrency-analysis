Reading the \u201crules\u201d on this stuff is messy. \n\nThanks.",

I was changing wallets every week, and these wallets were meant to be disposable, so at one point I became lazy and stopped writing down the recovery phrases.\n\nYesterday my Trust Wallet app crashed, upon trying to make a coin transfer, and the next thing I know when I open the app again is my wallets are gone.\n\nI know I should have written off my phrases, but I'm hoping I can do either one of two things, and I'll explain why I think it's possible later:\n\n\u2022 Temper the app data so it can read the previous state and my wallets are visible to me again.\n\u2022 Find and decrypt the seed phrases from the app data\n\nThe reason why I think this is possible is because I'm on a rooted Android. So whenever I was using the app it would warn me about the risk of applications or attackers with root permission accessing my wallets info and seed phrases. By the same principle I think it's possible for me to access these files. The thing is I don't quite have the knowledge required for that.\n\nI may be hoping for a miracle but maybe some of you guys can help me. If you know any other subreddit where I can get better assistance please let me know. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Please don't pound on me to much for not writing the precious recovery phrases down. Thanks",

That was already done?\n\n\"Step 1: Restart your Device\n\nThis is the most overlooked step. A simple restart or turning the device off and on can clear any issues with the phone or with the app itself.\"\n\nOr submit a ticket (step 8)?\n\nhttps://community.trustwallet.com/c/asktrust",

Maybe you can see the answer in the source code for another Android wallet app. I'd try Schildbach's Bitcoin wallet app first  \n\nAnd then, how to see those hidden files in a rooted Android? That should be trivial",
