Short interest on everything is insane right now, big money stocks like APPL and TSLA have slid 30%+ even with great quarterly revenue reports. Sorry but I lived through the Dot-Com and 2008 bursts and both of them started like this but the major effects weren't felt for 2 years. Just wait, we'll be back to the Cash 4 Gold places putting guys on the corner spinning signs again soon enough.",
