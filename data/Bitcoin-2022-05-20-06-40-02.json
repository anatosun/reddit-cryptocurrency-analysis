Yesterday night I was trying to use a new credit card and it caused a failed transaction. Following that came my card that I always use failing because of \u201csuspicious activity.\u201d Ramp then disabled my account and have ignored me ever since notifying me on my account being disabled because I had violated their terms of service. I then decided to use MoonPay and got so frustrated at all my cards being declined. I don\u2019t trust Coinbase and haven\u2019t heard of any other good on-ramps. Is there anything without a KYC that I can use? Or at least anything that isn\u2019t gonna disable my account because of a couple of failed transactions.",

Even when it can be done such as with local bitcoins (I think local bitcoins do kyc now though) or similar sites or with BTC ATMs you are usually paying a premium for your coins.\n\nThe best thing you can do is have a KYCd on ramp (I'm from Europe so I use swissborg) and mix your txs onchain with multiple wallets or put your coins on LN then transfer to a secondary wallet and remove them from LN onto your main wallet.\n\nAlso check out [kycnot.me](http://kycnot.me) if you're determined to find a non kyc onramp.",
