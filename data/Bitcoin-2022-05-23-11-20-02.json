We're entering an economic situation that Bitcoin and crypto has not experienced before. All bets off ? Obviously this is early days and from what I've been reading, it seems the Fed cannot increase interest rates by any meaningful amount because if they do they will not be able to afford the interest repayments on the debt they have created.......will they reverse and print more ? Seems unlikely as this would cause even higher inflation. If the cost of living continues will people have any disposable income to invest in Bitcoin ?",
