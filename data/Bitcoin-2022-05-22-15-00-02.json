The probability that a random attacker would know the security exploits of the internet and servers vs Bitcoin is high, considering one has 35 years in existence and everyone knows/uses it and it's a huge target for those 4ish decades (of common knowledge) while the other is still niche.\n\nAlso one has less opportunity to make money off it - Bitcoin has both less money in the system in general, but also the attacker would instantly be noticed and his gain limited with a   \n fork to e.g. not use SHA anymore anywhere (or rolled back, even, if he can't sell it all before being noticed).\n\nIn contrast, you could milk general server exploits on millions of sites, products, servers, services, etc for a decade, and if one shuts down or fixes itself you move on to the next.\n\nBasically you are better using an exploit where (a) it won't attract attention, and (b) even if 1 person fixes it, you can still use it on others.  Putting all your eggs in \"Bitcoin\" violates both of those and therefore is the worst choice.",
