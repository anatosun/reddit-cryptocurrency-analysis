I was wondering if you guys knew of a smart contract template that would be easy and efficient for this. Since we are just starting out we aren't exactly sure how we should proceed at this stage. [https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard) We've been checking the templates in this site.\n\nAlso if anyone has any extra tips on how to go forward with this please don't hesitate to tell me. I'm trying to learn everything at once and its been rather overwhelming.",

In my opinion that seems quite a hassle and maybe will decrease voter turnout.\n\nSmart contracts are useful if you are interacting with strangers and there is money involved. Then you need a more complex system which is fraud-proof and transparent.\n\nThe case that you are describing could be much easier solved by a simple website/app which interacts with a traditional backend.\n\nI am all for wider adoption of Blockchain technology, but we as a community have to be aware that it is not a good solution for every use case.",

What do you do if this person is successful but misrepresents data?\n\nIn traditional companies, that is what we have reporting requirements for and you can take them to court.
