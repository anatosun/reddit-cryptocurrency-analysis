For every supposed \"flaw\" of Bitcoin, from slow transaction speeds to not being PoS, hard-forks have already been made. And all have pretty much flopped. So \"better\" doesn't mean anything nowadays - what problem would this government coin be solving that Bitcoin doesn't already solve.\n\nTheoretically possible? Well, the EU is already promoting proof of stake over proof of work, with the . They're already talking about a potential CBDC, and convincing people that  a CBDC makes Bitcoin redundant is a red herring that's already been pushed around, and accepted by people.\n\nIf you want to steel against it, just don't fall for the governments antics, and buy and self-custody your Bitcoin.

That have to seize banknotes or reissue new ones and render the old ones illegitimate. We operate way beyond what can be backed by physical stores of gold. There's no going back without financial ruin across every country in this world.\n\nGovernments can't fork Bitcoin bc they don't control Bitcoin. They could create a new coin that is either backed by something or not and try to convince the people to adopt it like you said but why would anybody listen to them. This would be equivalent to buying snake oil from the snake oil salesman back in the wild west days except the snake oil salesman would be your government.

If anything is true in this country it's that people don't trust our government and they may not understand cryptocurrency worth a damn but once you say that they're being tracked game over. The media does a terrible job of separating the two most likely purposefully and lump in stable coins, Bitcoin, CDBC coins, even talking about China launching CDBC All as one in the same lol\n\nI think the most likely scenario to ever wipe out Bitcoin is the same thing that would wipe out our current financial system that is predominantly electronically based and that's just global catastrophe and or global war with widespread long-standing power and internet outages. It would be tough for Bitcoin to operate, while not impossible not very practical if this scenario were to arise. At the same time your debit card, credit cards, and electronically ledgerd bank accounts would be pretty impractical as well. Banks going back to operating without internet and electronics wouldn't be very successful at all. Transactions and banking in general would grind to almost a halt or at best a slow crawl",

This is why an independent, critical media is so important.\n\nIt became more difficult to pull off with the advent of an uncensored internet, but they are trying to get their power back by establishing information gatekeepers on the internet so they can again control what information people see and therefore make them more controllable.\n\nThis isn't a unique problem to Bitcoin. It can lead to bad things and loss of liberty in all aspects of your life. It is something all citizens of every nation should be concerned about and constantly pushing back top-down control.\n\nSo yeah, governments can attack Bitcoin. In all sorts of ways. Bitcoin is resistant to such attacks -- Bitcoin will keep on working, tick tock next block, whether or not a government CBDC is foisted on people -- but we can't ever be complacent. Just because governments can't outright kill the Bitcoin network doesn't mean they can't take your liberty and make your life crappy.",
