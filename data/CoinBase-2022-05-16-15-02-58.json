At first I was told my name didn't match between bank and coinbase. Which my first name did not match (short spelling of my first name vs long spelling of my first name mismatch). I corrected this by going to the bank and talking with paypal. Still even after this correct the connection fails. I am confused why getting a payment method is so difficult on coinbase, since this is the only site i've ever had this issue with.",
