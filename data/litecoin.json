They essentially bought dirty coins without their knowledge!!)\n\n* It has had literally 100% uptime since it's inception. Bitcoin and virtually all other chains have not.\n\n\nI'm tired and I'm sure there are many more reasons why LTC is awesome but I'm done for now. Maybe someone else has more to say. I think LTC is a great chain but it's not my only asset so I'm really not mentally biased on a financial level. I just see the truth in tech. \n\n\nIt's absolutely better than Bitcoin on a technical level - that's why it was made!\nNow comparing it to Ethereum...

Umbrel seems like a good fit, as all it's really doing is creating Docker containers to run apps (like litecoind and lndltc). \n\nSo I sent a message Luke Childs (one of the cofounders of Umbrel) and they told me that they would not allow Litecoin apps onto their app store. ^(~~fucking bitcoin maxis~~) So the other option is that we have to fork Umbrel and maintain our own fork, the problem with this is that they have an unusual license. I don't think it'd be much of an issue to comply with this but it takes time. If I had more time, this would be a big priority for me to work on, sadly I don't have much time.",

Most likely bitcoin will be widely adopted first, but eventually when the public becomes more familiar with crypto, bitcoin adoption will go up as well. \n\nThe main features mirror bitcoin but it differs in target block time being shorter (has pros and cons) and number of \u2018units\u2019 84m as opposed to bitcoin 21m - ultimately an illusion if you understand fractions.\n\nSuperiority is subjective.

For example, Bitcoin has such high fees that a lot of people with small investments can't even spend or cash out their Bitcoin, same with Ethereum. Just transferring their coins to sell it might cost half their investment.\n\nI hold a lot of different coins and when I want to very quickly buy another coin I have a program that tells me what will be the cheapest way to do that and 99% of the time it's using Litecoin. Which means I am often selling Litecoin more than any other asset I own. I often replenish the Litecoin but I do it much later or over a slow period of time or simply when I need it again. If a lot of other people are doing this, it's not going to help the price.\n\nI like Litecoin though because it's actually what I got into crypto for. To actually use cryptocurrency. Even if it doesn't make me rich it's really the coin coin for me that is fully realizing what I expected out of crypto in terms of me actually using it to buy stuff.",

Charlie Lee? The guy doesn't even hold litecoin. Can you say the same for Charles Hoskinson for example? If you wanna attack ADA might as well get to him. I find it truly amazing that Charlie Lee got rid of his LTC holdings, because that is the final step for a truly decentralized coin.  That is why Satoshi disappeared too. Do you wanna attack bitcoin? Do people even know who he is or does he even exist? Who knows!",

The problem with LTC is that it is trying to position itself as good or great for payments but a mature L2 BTC will make this obsolete and many L1 tokens already do this better and have other features as well. Charlie dumping his coins is also not a great look and continues to be a stain on LTCs reputation and even more so if you havent been around the space as long. Yes yes, Charlie has his reasons but not many people see it that way and it totally backfired. If BTC pumps, LTC pumps less and when BTC dumps, LTC dumps more so you get less upside and more downside which isnt ideal.",

A lot of what I read I understood better because of what I had experienced myself, though I warn anyone wanting to follow my example, the school of hard knocks is expensive, good education, but only if you can survive it.  I've spent many thousands of hours digging in on the subjects that interest me most including TA and long term crypto charts and eventually branching out to macroeconomics far beyond what I studied in school.  \n\nNo educational background in computers, just a hobbyists' interest.  And I still don't know anything compared to many, especially on more technical topics and especially on newer ones.  My crypto specific studies have slowed dramatically  though I still watch the charts as they continue to form, I've already answered my most pressing questions to my satisfaction.  There's always more to learn, but you have to prioritize both your questions as to what matters and of course real life.  \n\nA quick starter, this is what made me a believer in litecoin to start and what sent me down the rabbit hole on it: https://medium.com/@SatoshiLite/my-vision-for-segwit-and-lightning-networks-on-litecoin-and-bitcoin-cf95a7ab656b  Given when he wrote that and the zeitgeist of the time, it was incredibly visionary.

Blocks come in either too fast (1 min or less) or too slow (1 hr or more). They're supposed to come in every 10 mins. If the next block is 2 hours away, how can you compete with litecoin which would have already 48 confirmations by then? Litecoin is practically irreversible after 4 confirmations. That's 10 mins (2.5 mins x4). Bitcoin cash can NEVER beat litecoin on speed SECURELY. The only hope bcash has is zero confirmations, which makes the merchant do extra work for greater risk of non-payment. Why bother with the hassle of detecting double-spends when you can just accept litecoin and just forget about it?",

Bcash tried to cheat and pretend it was the real bitcoin and use an airdrop to capture all that infrastructure at once.  In some ways the ploy was successful, but signs of it's inorganic weakness started to emerge right away with all the internal civil wars and some delistings.  The zero confirmation strategy also strikes me as an unwise shortcut.  \n\nBut in any case, when you're born with that kind of deceit, I won't trust you again ever.  Trustlessness in crypto is about not having to trust other parties, but trust in the network itself has to be earned over time.  Most people don't understand that this, not long expected supply constraints, are the most important part about the halvings.  Every time a halving actually occurs and no interested party is able to change it and increase lifetime supply, it gives proof to the claim that bitcoin and litecoin will indeed have fixed supplies.  That's about earning trust.  It's a code audit under real world conditions for non-programmers.",

Example, calling LTC a fork of BTC is incorrect, that would make an assumption that both LTC and BTC came from the same chain which is incorrect. Regardless LTC is a strong contender to hold for the long term. Most of these meme coins are the equivalent of penny stocks, BTC, ETH and LTC are more akin to blue chip stocks IMO. Buy and then forget about them (or buy and stake if thats you're thing) they will make their safe returns. You dont need to sit on LTC charts all day ala the other meme coins to secure your profits in a PnD. Thats not to say LTC isn't worth trading as it can range over a decent gap at times. My point is you shouldnt feel the stress of holding something like shib or doge when holding LTC.",

Litecoin and Bitcoin share a lightning network and every litecoiner should read Charlie's vision statement on that: [link](https://medium.com/@SatoshiLite/my-vision-for-segwit-and-lightning-networks-on-litecoin-and-bitcoin-cf95a7ab656b)  \n\nThe short version as Charlie has reexplained since is that litecoin can always be the cheapest way onto and off of lightning, offering extra onchain settlement and overflow capacity whenever circumstances demand it, and ltc can cement itself forever in a global network where lightning is the connective tissue between chains.  Just as we've dominated old world infrastructure like exchanges and payment processors in this past decade, litecoin's next few decades depend on being a pioneer and staking a claim in lightning liquidity early.  \n\nI don't know how to contribute to this myself other than to make the case that it's important, but this is literally what got me into litecoin.  In 2017 I thought I would mine ltc and sell it for other stuff, then I read that medium post I linked above and I was sold.  We may not be able to make instant full use of this any time soon, but the more infrastructure we maintain now, the more we keep our foot in the door so that when opportunity strikes, we'll be ready.  \n\nThanks to op for noticing and raising this \ud83d\udc14\ud83d\udcaa and if you have the skills and are looking for something important to contribute to, from my perspective anything that helps keep litecoin's lightning opportunity open is top priority.",

Personally, I believe that most people see the benefits of being their own bank and want to hold their keys in a cold-storage wallet (on-chain) as opposed to on a hot wallet that is managed by a service provider.   \n\n\nBitcoin can support about 2-3k transactions per block, 1 block every 10 minutes, 144 blocks a day, 365 days a year* and that's about 160 million transactions a year. Even with other updates like MWEB which could double the number of on-chain transactions that's still a limited number of transactions.  The fees once the blocks are consistently full will keep growing and people will eventually be priced out from using Bitcoin On-Chain.   \n\n\nI believe the demand for on-chain cold storage will grow greater than what Bitcoin can support. That doesn't mean people won't or can't use it, it's just the supply of on-chain transactions is limited and the overflow will go to IMO Litecoin.",

You can pass litecoin across and get bitcoin out or vice versa through sub swaps.  \n\nLightning as is isn't that easy to use, however.  An individual isn't easily and safely able to set up their own local lightning channel.  There are dangers to trying to set it up on your own, you could lose your coins.  Right now it tends to be a custodial thing.  Organizations with ample resources can enable use of lightning easily and securely, but there are still constraints and complexities.  You need to get your bitcoin into a lightning channel at full fee, slow confirmation before you can get the benefits of speed and costs.  There's a place for it, but it's not as simple as some people think.  \n\nI suspect Lightning in the future will be more of a behind the scenes technology, decentralized batching with global liquidity rather than a consumer's way to buy coffee, and it will boost the case for litecoin, not limit it.  Having litecoin and bitcoin be interoperable via the lightning network gives large operators options when there is congestion and fee issues, and retain a close nexus between these two solid reliable chains.  Think of litecoin as a bypass or spur route, but most importantly as a partner.  Litecoin is a cheaper faster way both onto and off of lightning.  \n\nWe've literally never been nor tried to be competition to bitcoin.  We're a proud sidekick.  Litecoin is Robin to Bitcoin's Batman.  And lightning just increases the connectivity between the two.",

If Bitcoin were to become mortally-wounded somehow, I see Litecoin as the coin best positioned to take over in its place without really skipping a beat.  So, staying close to BTC especially in fundamental ways, has value.\n2. Litecoin is a friendly fork to Bitcoin and serves as a solid test bed.  If MWEB is a successful upgrade and well-received, it provides a preview and a clear path forward for Bitcoin to upgrade in a conservative, thoughtful way down the road.  But, really, that idea over and over, not just MWEB.  It needs to remain similar to BTC for this to remain true.\n3. I think the conversion of energy into monetary value is a lasting concept trapped in momentary consciousness.  Energy will become cleaner, cheaper, and more decentralized over time.  If you zoom out to say even 10-15 years from now, I don't think we'll still be arguing about energy consumption in this context, especially of a nascent global reserve asset.  Having POW coins that have thrived over that time period will add to their value, their perceived reliability, their hard money nature as compared to POS coins, etc.  Having multiple solutions for different problems/clients/scenarios is beneficial for a future that we don't yet understand.\n\nSo, I think LTC should remain POW, personally.",

A lot of what I read I understood better because of what I had experienced myself, though I warn anyone wanting to follow my example, the school of hard knocks is expensive, good education, but only if you can survive it.  I've spent many thousands of hours digging in on the subjects that interest me most including TA and long term crypto charts and eventually branching out to macroeconomics far beyond what I studied in school.  \n\nNo educational background in computers, just a hobbyists' interest.  And I still don't know anything compared to many, especially on more technical topics and especially on newer ones.  My crypto specific studies have slowed dramatically  though I still watch the charts as they continue to form, I've already answered my most pressing questions to my satisfaction.  There's always more to learn, but you have to prioritize both your questions as to what matters and of course real life.  \n\nA quick starter, this is what made me a believer in litecoin to start and what sent me down the rabbit hole on it: https://medium.com/@SatoshiLite/my-vision-for-segwit-and-lightning-networks-on-litecoin-and-bitcoin-cf95a7ab656b  Given when he wrote that and the zeitgeist of the time, it was incredibly visionary.

I am hoping for this trend to reverse.\n\nThis is something I find attractive, but its designed as a compliment Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cdigital gold\u201d as \u201cdigital silver\u201d. No other coin is really designed to take that role.",

The great economist Jevons in his benchmark text from 1875 \"Money and the Mechanisms of Exchange\" discussed the 4 phases needed for the development of true sound money. Jevons used the history of gold and silver as examples.\n\nPhase 1 - Decorative, a collectable with name recognition (starts as humans begin to adore something like the shine of pure Gold or the whitish luster of Silver when its polished or a rare painting or rare sculpture. In my opinion BTC is in this phase now. Perhaps LTC is now just entering this phase or it may soon due to its name recognition and solid dependable crypto history ).\n\nPhase 2 - A store of value (Gold and Silver have passed through this phase, BTC maybe now just starting). \n\nPhase 3 - A transactional currency (Gold and Silver have passed through this phase). \n\nPhase 4 - A unit of account (Gold and Silver have passed through this phase). \n\nThat LTC is the digital silver compared to BTC being digital gold is quite reasonable. Users of LTC can more easily afford a whole Litecoin than a whole Bitcoin and more easily transact with Litecoin for smaller sums (Phase 3) much as with Silver vs Gold.",

For example, Bitcoin miners cannot direct their hashpower towards the Litecoin network, whereas they could direct it towards something like Bitcoin Cash. This means things like BTC miners can't switch to LTC nor attack the network. Relevant because BTC network has so much hashpower.

If more than $200 of profit was exempt, but not less, it would keep all small transactions complicated and let the larger, material capital gains get away with exempt status, effectively penalizing actual users and giving preferential tax treatment to larger investors.\n\nIf it is simply written incorrectly, and they really mean less, it seems like a great thing for promoting use of all cryptocurrency, including VRSC, the community/project I develop for, as well as LTC, BTC, ETH, and other serious projects.",

However, the space changes so fast. Sometimes you can be up 1500% but if you didn't sell it and held... you could end up -30% for holding. It depends the project or coin. I love LTC, I mine it, I sell LTC miners, I believe in it BUT when it comes to putting cash into projects or coins. I don't go after LTC. Holding will be a winning strategy if you believe in what you're holding onto and do your research. \n\nThink of it like I'm okay with this going to \"0\". NEVER overextend yourself or overinvest, that's how people sell at a loss during bear markets, when they need the cash. \n\nDon't need the cash is the point here. Do research and remember to keep calm, all markets are insanely volatile. Look at historical data, everything you can. Stay informed while holding the entire time. Put it away and forget about it.\n\nNFA (I have been wrong a million times. Just an opinion)",

Most likely bitcoin will be widely adopted first, but eventually when the public becomes more familiar with crypto, bitcoin adoption will go up as well. \n\nThe main features mirror bitcoin but it differs in target block time being shorter (has pros and cons) and number of \u2018units\u2019 84m as opposed to bitcoin 21m - ultimately an illusion if you understand fractions.\n\nSuperiority is subjective.

If we use the bitcoin's silver analogy silver is a dual use metal being both a precious metal store of value and a critical industrial use metal, but its primary value is found in its industrial applications.  It only trades as a precious metal when there is political and economic instability but it is always in demand for its utility or industrial use.\n\nLitecoin used to trade as a 'precious metal' but its actual highest and best use appears to be as a utility for transmitting value rapidly, securely and inexpensively.  This is likely why it continues to be adopted as an acceptable form of cryptocurrency payment.  Its value going forward is likely to be determined by the amount of demand from buyers and sellers, and value transmission.\n\nIt simply isn't viewed as a store of value, 'digital silver', if you will, in the way that btc is considered 'digital gold'.  It just isn't (yes, I know, your little brother and Aunt Flo think it is, and there's that billionaire guy in who does too, so there!).\n\nLitecoin appears to have solidified its position, and it is an important one, as a utility token but all the good stuff is happening elsewhere.\n\nThis is not to say that it won't rise in price....you know the old trope that a rising tide lifts all boats, but its position in the crytocoin world is almost inevitably going to slip, probably not into obscurity, but definitely into the metaphorical nosebleed seats but, hey, at least it is at the game.",

A lot of what I read I understood better because of what I had experienced myself, though I warn anyone wanting to follow my example, the school of hard knocks is expensive, good education, but only if you can survive it.  I've spent many thousands of hours digging in on the subjects that interest me most including TA and long term crypto charts and eventually branching out to macroeconomics far beyond what I studied in school.  \n\nNo educational background in computers, just a hobbyists' interest.  And I still don't know anything compared to many, especially on more technical topics and especially on newer ones.  My crypto specific studies have slowed dramatically  though I still watch the charts as they continue to form, I've already answered my most pressing questions to my satisfaction.  There's always more to learn, but you have to prioritize both your questions as to what matters and of course real life.  \n\nA quick starter, this is what made me a believer in litecoin to start and what sent me down the rabbit hole on it: https://medium.com/@SatoshiLite/my-vision-for-segwit-and-lightning-networks-on-litecoin-and-bitcoin-cf95a7ab656b  Given when he wrote that and the zeitgeist of the time, it was incredibly visionary.

Mimble wimble hopefully but other coins are eating up market share with use cases, which is what i believe is holding ltc back and could be the death sentence for ltc long term. \n\nI hold i non-inconsequential amount of ltc, and would love to see it succeed, but i have serious long term concerns about its performance and viability. I think it may always be around but never catch up and perform. That combined with the risks of being basically phased out by other coins that carry more utility and innovation means that it\u2019s a higher perceived risk for me, and others agree when it comes to voting with their wallets. \n\nLong term i just don\u2019t have that concern with btc, which i think will always have a very strong position. Others could overtake btc in price(development on eth type chains) but i don\u2019t see btc losing value/relevance due to it being \u201cthe\u201d crypto that started it all.",

You will want to use a well known company, or set up your own.\n\nThe best option is to set up your own VPN, such as WireGuard, on a VPS of your own. You could use a VPS from RamNode or Linode. The US$3/month VPS from RamNode is more than enough, and will provide better security than a more expensive VPN from a known company.\n\nThe mainstream VPS companies may be blocked by your country, or may put you on a list of some sort if you are seen connecting to their IPs. The only benefit from the mainstream VPS is that they should have dozens or hundreds of IPs to choose, and in multiple countries.\n\n* WireGuard install in a few simple steps https://github.com/angristan/wireguard-install\n* RamNode https://www.ramnode.com\n* Linode https://www.linode.com",

But then you are at the whim of their system. If PayPal's network goes down then so does the access point to your coins. Just as if Wells Fargo's site goes down then WF customers are SOL. On the flip side, PayPal is a huge company with huge insurance policies and they can hire a team of cyber security experts to help protect your money. \n\nYou could also assume responsibility yourself and buy coins on an exchange and send them to your own wallet. This is similar to having gold in you house. No one can really stop you from using it or moving it even if all the websites for all the banks went offline. You would essentially be your own bank. But with that comes some risk of theft, some risk of accidental loss and some risk of disaster such as a fire or water damage.\n\nSome people feel safe with the former because it is similar to online banking and they aren't technologically inclined. Some people feel safer with the latter because it is closer to the original intent of crypto and doesn't require that they trust anyone but themselves.",

He's always reminding people that BTC is #1 and LTC just needs to be kept to its basic core. I just heard an interview that he did, and I do wish someone else was pushing development, with a bit more enthusiasm.\n\nLTC itself presents a better value than BTC, technically and arguably fundamentally. Bitcoin has the marketing going for it and also it has wrapped BTC. There is also 1-2 companies trying to add some form of contracts on top of it, although LTC has Flame Networks I believe now tackling these same issues to get LTC into DeFi space.\n\nBullish on LTC, not of big fan of Lee's energy, personally.",

                    "response": " \n\nI already have BTC and looking for coin other than BTC. I pick LTC, here is why:\n\n1. LTC is a finish product : if there is no more development at all from now on, LTC will still up and running for very long time as store of value like BTC. Is always good to have alternative to BTC because not everyone need to move hundred of millions/billions dollars. Normal people like me can move hundred/thousand dollars with smaller fee and faster transaction with LTC. Most importantly it is super secure.\n2. Security : LTC use script algorithm while BTC use SHAH 256. Both of them DOMINATE in their own algorithm. (that is the reason why LTC is more secure than Bcash) prove of work is more resilience than prove of stake. BTC/LTC history prove that.\n3. BTC/LTC is highly unlikely to be replace by others : To be able to duplicate BTC or LTC, such chain need to have at least years of incubation period that no one attack it. Those day are long gone. Any new prove of stake (fair launch) coin will get attack form the most sophisticated hacker/entity from day one. Therefore BTC/LTC are the HIGHLY SECURE prove of work coin that we will have for the foreseeable future.\n4. Fair launch and no pre mine : All existing coins are either mine or purchase. No entity has free coin or pre mine to benefit themselves. Not even Charlie.\n5. Open, Public, Borderless, Neutral, Censorship resistant. (From Andrea Antonopoulos )\n\nHoward Marks once said : The reason we can make big gain in asset is because very few people are looking at the asset. No one expect it will have a bright future, therefore the price reflect their opinion. If we can find something that has very little hype and most likely will survive for the foreseeable future, that will make us huge gain.\n\nIn my humble opinion: beside BTC, LTC is the one who I have confident that it will survive for the next decade. LTC has no single point of failure, unlikely to have bug in the code. Even though tomorrow Charlie run over by a bus and LTC will still survive and running as usual. ( sorry Charlie, you will live long enough to see the success of LTC)\n\nP/S : I hold 50% BTC, 30% LTC, 20% ETH since 2017\n\nI only do portfolio balance at the extreme ratio.\n\nI hope this will help some new comers that interest in LTC. If you have doubt about LTC, zoom out and you will see more clearly.\n\nCheers!",

But it doesn't make the value go away. Litecoin doesn't have the sheer amount of shills and PnD schemes that shitcoins have so of course you're gonna miss out on some short term shitcoin gains. But one day, maybe it's gonna be with Mimblewimble, people will see the value of LTC. \n\nAnother example of sticking to my thesis would have been me with Doge. When I got into crypto some months ago I thought about buying some Doge because my rationale was that it might become some meme payment. I didn't buy any, bc BTC and LTC seemed like the more reasonable approach, and it is. But my rationale seems to become kinda true more and more. Would I have stuck to it I could have made some pocket change with Doge. \n\nSo my conclusion is: Stick to the facts and you're gonna win.",

I can't emphasise that enough. \nOnce you've run the numbers on a few potential investments, and found one that has a great chance of making you money.... invest.  \nIt's the same with picking stocks. \nYou don't blindly pick one because other people bought it. A good investment has the potential to make you wealthy, or lose your savings, so don't mess around. Investigate all of the financial statements, read about their plans for the future, look at their team and research how successful they've been in the past etc. \nCrypto is not as easy perhaps because there are no financial statements, but there is a lot of information out there, you can do a lot of research, look up their websites, social media, online groups - if something seems odd, then ask questions. \nCrypto is not going away any time soon, so you could perform this research within a couple of weeks, depending on how much time you have, and then invest. \n\nI personally love Litecoin, and think it is a great time to invest because it hasn't got back to its ATH level, and we're in a bit of a bull run, so I think it's going to get back there, and surpass it, hitting a new ATH. \n\nI like it because I've researched it though, and I know a lot about crypto in general. I wouldn't invest hundreds or thousands of dollars, euros, pounds in something however if I didn't have that knowledge. \n\nThere are a lot of morons out there, and I could be one of them, so do your own research. \n\nBest of luck.",

The haters don't like it because unlike say... Bitcoin which is used more as a holder of value.  LTC is a lot more likely to be used in actual practical use application/transactions generally.  (For example sure BTC tops LTC in transactional value.  But look at the actual value of BTC in market cap compared to Litecoin.)\n\nThere was an article shared on here today that basically suggested that the value of LTC doesn't exactly match it's worth and that it SHOULD be at least 11x higher relative to where BTC is now (And it has accomplished that feat multiple times and fairly recently.) --- I think it's only a matter of time before it plays catchup. Because it always does.\n\nI think some people forget that LTC is in more wallets than any other crypto outside of BTC.  (Even more than ETH) - It's just... people seem to prefer it for small transactions compared to the others.  It's always strange to me how several other crypto's pass it in market cap with far less case use.  In pretty much all regards, LTC should be a top 5 crypto.

There are protections designed into the network to protect users, but some wallets don't implement these correctly. \n\nImagine if you sent a bank transfer to the wrong account number because the bank didn't validate the account number with the account name? That's the banking equivalent of sending to the wrong address. With crypto, since it's decentralised, it's not possible to contact a support person to return your money.

If we use the bitcoin's silver analogy silver is a dual use metal being both a precious metal store of value and a critical industrial use metal, but its primary value is found in its industrial applications.  It only trades as a precious metal when there is political and economic instability but it is always in demand for its utility or industrial use.\n\nLitecoin used to trade as a 'precious metal' but its actual highest and best use appears to be as a utility for transmitting value rapidly, securely and inexpensively.  This is likely why it continues to be adopted as an acceptable form of cryptocurrency payment.  Its value going forward is likely to be determined by the amount of demand from buyers and sellers, and value transmission.\n\nIt simply isn't viewed as a store of value, 'digital silver', if you will, in the way that btc is considered 'digital gold'.  It just isn't (yes, I know, your little brother and Aunt Flo think it is, and there's that billionaire guy in who does too, so there!).\n\nLitecoin appears to have solidified its position, and it is an important one, as a utility token but all the good stuff is happening elsewhere.\n\nThis is not to say that it won't rise in price....you know the old trope that a rising tide lifts all boats, but its position in the crytocoin world is almost inevitably going to slip, probably not into obscurity, but definitely into the metaphorical nosebleed seats but, hey, at least it is at the game.",

A lot of what I read I understood better because of what I had experienced myself, though I warn anyone wanting to follow my example, the school of hard knocks is expensive, good education, but only if you can survive it.  I've spent many thousands of hours digging in on the subjects that interest me most including TA and long term crypto charts and eventually branching out to macroeconomics far beyond what I studied in school.  \n\nNo educational background in computers, just a hobbyists' interest.  And I still don't know anything compared to many, especially on more technical topics and especially on newer ones.  My crypto specific studies have slowed dramatically  though I still watch the charts as they continue to form, I've already answered my most pressing questions to my satisfaction.  There's always more to learn, but you have to prioritize both your questions as to what matters and of course real life.  \n\nA quick starter, this is what made me a believer in litecoin to start and what sent me down the rabbit hole on it: https://medium.com/@SatoshiLite/my-vision-for-segwit-and-lightning-networks-on-litecoin-and-bitcoin-cf95a7ab656b  Given when he wrote that and the zeitgeist of the time, it was incredibly visionary.

Fundamentals: With a low circulating supply, it will only take a market cap of 66 billion for LTC to hit $1,000 each, this is pretty miniscule compared to some of the other relevant coins. We have a substantial tech update going live by the middle of the month, this will likely spark a parabolic move to $1,000 or more. Technical analysis: Elliot wave theory suggests we are about to engage in the third wave of what may be a super cycle. Fibonacci extensions suggest the upside of this impulse move could be over $1700. $1,000 is the conservative target. Trend analysis: after making a double top during the rally at the beginning of the year, LTC found support high enough that the overall trend upwards is completely valid. This is reinforced by the rules that govern Elliot wave theory and the use of Fibonacci ratios. We are also consistently posting higher lows.\n\nWith all these factors in play, it is silly not to take Litecoin seriously for this run.",

More a store of value than a day-to-day payment option. LN works though, we see it in El Salvador.\n\nDOGE is a joke with almost no development. A hardfork from a very old LTC standard with changed variables.\n\nLTC has a fair amount of development, has almost no fees (cheaper than BTC and DOGE), is decently fast. Has a bunch of upcoming features. Doesn't need LN to be in day-to-day use.\n\n\\---\n\nRest is either PoS and/or not focused on payment. These coins will have a very hard time to get approved by the SEC and other regulators. Plus it is uncertain if PoS could be a risk for the security of the coin. If one entity gets the majority of the available coins, it has the power with no further costs of accumulation and no mechanism to take it away. Also a lot of PoS coins in the top20 are in the power of the devs with very large % ownership, they can shut down the chain if they want or need. We saw that happen with SOL.\n\nWith hashrates and PoW there is always an opportunity for change, we recently saw this happening in China.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've got 18% of my investment in LTC (100+), I'm not worried at all.",

                    "response": "You didn't ask why people don't hate it, so I'll give you my opinion about why some hate it:\n\nLTC was originally treated with respect by the community because it was based on the Bitcoin code but intentionally made to be twice as plentiful and thus less costly.  As such, it was easy to understand and, because Charlie Lee was tapped into the bitcoin crowd and the btc crew took to it, as well as those who didn't want to spend the money necessary to mine btc such that LTC got swept up in the bull market mania for crypto.\n\nThe problem came after the 2017 crash when Mr. Lee made a timely and, in my opinion, ethically fine exit of his own coin albeit with a rather lame rationale, near the top of the LTC market which then promptly crashed along with all the rest of crypto.\n\nOn the positive side, because LTC is an OG coin, and Mr. Lee quite wisely decided to allow doge and ltc to be mined simultaneously in a mutual self-defence pact, Litecoin's recognition factor has enabled it to be positioned along with BTC, ETH and Bitcoin Cash as acceptable cryptocurrency and thus has widespread recognition and acceptance as well as assured community interest so long as Doge is a thing.\n\nOn the negative side, the Litecoin Foundation is being run with a skeleton crew on projects that are not only helpful to the coin but critical to its long term adoption, use and existence while other new, and arguably superior projects are being worked on by legions of DEVs around the clock, around the world.\n\nWhat has happened is that while the world of crypto is exploding with innovation and applications/usage, LTC is relatively moribund and is seen as a Loser.\n\nPeople HATE LOSERS and thus many people who perceive LTC as a loser HATE Litecoin.\n\nThere are really good reasons to fear for LTC's future that are not related to its weak development and that is that, while LTC was almost always one of the named coins that X companies would accept as payment along with BTC and ETH, I've noticed that fewer and fewer announcements of adoption include LTC as one of the accepted forms of payment.  If this trend continues it will be fatal to LTC's long term prospects.\n\nAnother thing that bears watching is the Financial Sector.  It is important to see how much LTC is bought by funds and how many funds include LTC in them to see whether it will remain one of the Establishment coins which it is still considered to be, although that claim is growing ever more feeble with each passing month.\n\nI personally hold more than I would like right now and have recently sold some to buy ETH and BTC......and am getting ready to sell more to buy some Alt Coins that I believe have a brighter future than LTC.\n\nI'm sad to let go of my LTC because I have great respect for Charlie Lee and by association his coin but I've read the writing on the wall.  LTC has become permanently marginalized which is not to say that it has no value, and because of this it has disappointed expectations and some people hate it for that.",

No ground breaking developments for new crypto ppl and some old crypto ppl are still unhappy with how Charlie dumped to either cash out or remove any conflict of interest depending on who you ask. \n\n2) ppl call it a dinosaur - it is a dinosaur in crypto terms, which I guess is considered a bad thing for price action, for me it is proof of how well tested it is.  Litecoin is solid, I use it to do most of my crypto transfers. It's not sexy, it just works, Its fast and cheap and has been for a long time. Never had a complaint with it.  Bitcoin at times has been slow or  expensive to transfer, same with ETC, but not LTC, at least ime.\n\n3) is crypto manipulated - yes.  I don't think that is what's holding  LTC price down though.  \n\nI am in a somewhat similar situation in that I got some cheap enough that whenever i sell it probably won't be at a loss.  I have sold some recently but I'll probably hold on to most of it.  I don't think itll ever be 1/4 of BTC like they wanted but hopefully it gets close to .015 again some day.",

Being still strongly in the top 20 after 10 years proved its legitimacy as a real project on the long run, so a safer investment than others coins that usually die after 4 years.\n2. Received a better spotlight from mainstream news channel with BTC & ETH instead of others coins, giving it publicity & showing it as one of the 3 investment to do.\n3. Still room for development.\n4. Being still this cheap & far from its ATH, investors might think this is a coin that has a delayed rise, so another chance to catch the bull train before it goes up.\n\n\\-\n\n* Downside:\n\n1. LTC market cap rank has only been getting lower & while BTC, ETH broke their ATH, LTC barely got back to 50% of its own.\n2. Even in the largest crypto community, r/CryptoCurrency the coin is very rarely mentioned & when it is, the community now see it more negatively than positively, like: \"It got it's time to shine, but it's time to move on.\" Or because it's surpassed by new coins that reached the spotlight like ADA & DOT.\n3. For investors, that might be enough to convince them this is a dead project that has no future, slowly redder & redder.\n4. *And almost forgot, hype coins like SHIB have also recently greatly stolen the spotlight too. I've made a* [*post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfhoau/whats_the_point_to_invest_in_serious_crypto/) *yesterday sharing my concern about how badly it'll affect Crypto adoption & if the future might become more & more of those hype coins while serious coins are only getting ejected from the top. Might be worth to take a look at it.*\n\n\\-\n\nConclusion/TLDR: For the arguments, I've basically given 2 interpretations from the same data, leaving us in uncertainty. And predictably the future value of LTC won't depend on us, but once again on the big investors that will choose its fate. No matter our opinion & bullish/bearish signs, they'll have the final words with their view of the coin.",

Recent additions include paypal, venmo, bitpay, verifone, newegg, amc while developers have rolled out omnilite (tokens now, nfts later), taproot and a long effort to develop confidential transactions with mimblewimble extension blocks.  \n\nThe future is that current infrastructure begets future infrastructure, internal and external.  If you track back what infrastructure we have now, you'll see that it relies on past infrastructure and liquidity.  You can't build this stuff overnight, it takes time and network effect and organic growth.  Major exchanges led to paxos, paxos led to paypal, we didn't even reach out to paypal, they just added us.\n\nThe internal infrastructure to me looks like lightning.  Exchanges were the primary form of past infrastructure, those will look like dirt trails someday IMO, lightning is the future, part of a global backbone that will underlie everything, not just coffee (coffee is how you start to build liquidity organically to support other things).  Other coins fear lightning, litecoin has embraced it because it isn't about off chain transactions, it's about cross chain transactions and it will further litecoin's ability to both strengthen bitcoin as well as to be strengthened by it.",

It's unfortunate Doge has been more successful with that so far, but I think longterm Litecoin can be what Dogecoin was during this bullrun.",
