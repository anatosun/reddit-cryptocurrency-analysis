Who knows if it will give you a better ROI than bitcoin alone, however. There's a lot needed for this to happen, and only one scenario where it can happen. Bitcoin has to moonshot AND transactions with bitcoin have to be very expensive and too numerous. It seems lightning transactions now cost one Satoshi.  The flipside of this, exchanging currencies on the lightning network is going to be very efficient, so all cryptos on the lightning network will be buoyed by a bitcoin moonshot.",

If an upgrade is unsuccessful or vulnerable, billions will get wiped out. The risk vs reward to upgrade  bitcoin's capabilities is very high. As a result, bitcoin development will be slow.

But is that what you want? Is an address list any use by itself? I suggest it's only useful if you can list all the address's transactions  \n\nSimpler approach: modify Litecoin Core to output every address as it does an initial node download and build  \n\nOr use a tool which already builds an address index, and extract the addresses from that index - ElectrumX",

Umbrel seems like a good fit, as all it's really doing is creating Docker containers to run apps (like litecoind and lndltc). \n\nSo I sent a message Luke Childs (one of the cofounders of Umbrel) and they told me that they would not allow Litecoin apps onto their app store. ^(~~fucking bitcoin maxis~~) So the other option is that we have to fork Umbrel and maintain our own fork, the problem with this is that they have an unusual license. I don't think it'd be much of an issue to comply with this but it takes time. If I had more time, this would be a big priority for me to work on, sadly I don't have much time.",

Most likely bitcoin will be widely adopted first, but eventually when the public becomes more familiar with crypto, bitcoin adoption will go up as well. \n\nThe main features mirror bitcoin but it differs in target block time being shorter (has pros and cons) and number of \u2018units\u2019 84m as opposed to bitcoin 21m - ultimately an illusion if you understand fractions.\n\nSuperiority is subjective. If making smaller payments is useful to you, litecoin is superior. If you are a billionaire and security of the finality of a transfer is important to you, then bitcoin is superior.",

I agree it's somewhat undervalued. But when comparing coins/tokens, the ratio of the market caps is not correlated to the ratio of the supplies -- it doesn't work that way and never will. I mean, just look at SHIB(!).",

For example, Bitcoin has such high fees that a lot of people with small investments can't even spend or cash out their Bitcoin, same with Ethereum. Just transferring their coins to sell it might cost half their investment.\n\nI hold a lot of different coins and when I want to very quickly buy another coin I have a program that tells me what will be the cheapest way to do that and 99% of the time it's using Litecoin. Which means I am often selling Litecoin more than any other asset I own. I often replenish the Litecoin but I do it much later or over a slow period of time or simply when I need it again. If a lot of other people are doing this, it's not going to help the price.\n\nI like Litecoin though because it's actually what I got into crypto for. To actually use cryptocurrency. Even if it doesn't make me rich it's really the coin coin for me that is fully realizing what I expected out of crypto in terms of me actually using it to buy stuff.",

I think it will be around as a coin for a while due to its slight first mover advantage but will never explode in value and will always be in the shadows. Yes undervalued for what it does compared to Bitcoin, but not undervalued in context of the whole market\n\nJust my opinion",

Understanding simple supply and demand should give you your answer. If everyone all of a sudden has demand and ability to attain resources that means that supply will go down and price will go up. ( aka inflation ). To answer your question ( assuming that wealth means monetary wealth ) inflation happens. \n\nWhich means on a macroeconomic scale, nothing changes. Even if you were to increase supply somewhere that would give you stagnation in labor force, even with advancements in automated labor you would get society stagnation and rot ( people need challenges and purpose ) because humans are lazy and don\u2019t want to challenge themselves. Drugs end up being the only escape of mundane reality leading to more social degradation. The only way this doesn\u2019t happen is that humans as a whole learn to do what is best instead of what is desired or easy, the chances of that are slim.\n\nHaving a forward thinking mind is depressing unless redemption exists outside of human limitations.\n\nA bit more drawn out than your simple question but nevertheless.",

Another up on bitcoin is that litecoin has 100% uptime over it's 10 year life, while bitcoin is at 99.98%.  It's also been early to add features like segwit and mweb, which not only give it a leg up on bitcoin, but also endear it to bitcoin because our proving of the technologies helps bitcoin adopt them.  \n\nI'd say there's a small chance litecoin outlasts bitcoin, though I believe both are fine for the next century or so, and I believe their shared lightning network will actually result in them mutually reinforcing each other's networks, so they'll probably always keep each other safe and strong one lightning becomes more and more important.  \n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/r2qent/litecoin_is_deep_clucking_value_an_exhaustive_and/",

The problem with LTC is that it is trying to position itself as good or great for payments but a mature L2 BTC will make this obsolete and many L1 tokens already do this better and have other features as well. Charlie dumping his coins is also not a great look and continues to be a stain on LTCs reputation and even more so if you havent been around the space as long. Yes yes, Charlie has his reasons but not many people see it that way and it totally backfired. If BTC pumps, LTC pumps less and when BTC dumps, LTC dumps more so you get less upside and more downside which isnt ideal.",

This a major difference between BTC and LTC and it was intented to keep mining power as decentralized as possible. LTC changed the algo when it forked BTC from sha256 to scrypt algo in order to make it ASIC resistant. This is important to decentralization as it allows ppl to mine with affordable hardware that they might even already have like CPUs/GPUs. \n\nWhile Asics for LTC have been since created it is still much more ASIC resistant than BTC and it is still difficult to produce more affordable more efficient miners. For instance the first major ASIC break through was the L3 by bitmain. It was released in 2017 and only now with the L7 is a vastly better ASIC getting created. That has allowed many small timers to get into LTC mining cheap over those 5 years keeping LTC very decentralized.",

Calling Litecoin \"ASIC resistant\" is ridiculous  \n\nThe reason Bitmain took 4 years to make a new generation of scrypt ASICs was that they were nearly wiped out by Bitcoin's 2018 price fall, and through 2018, 2019 and 2020 only made SHA256 ASICs. Unfortunately, Bitmain recovered and recently began making ASICs for scrypt and a couple of other hashing algorithms. They should have stayed away",

Not only is finite, but also it benefits from being a fork so it can adapt any new technology that is developed for Bitcoin. In a practical sense, why do we need Bitcoin when we have Litecoin?\n\nLitecoin was the first to adopt segwit, and the lightning network. Now it will be the first to adopt mimble wimble and extension blocks. Again why do we need Bitcoin? \n\n\nIn the future and I am talking maybe 50 years from now, Bitcoin will (hopefully) become the reserve currency, it is going to be expensive as fuck, moving any Bitcoin around will probably cost a few thousands. And the lightning network will carry the cost of opening a channel. At this point people will need an alternative coin that actually opens up channels for grandpa Bitcoin, and I am betting that coin will be Litecoin. So if Bitcoin succeeds then Litecoin succeeds.",

A lot of what I read I understood better because of what I had experienced myself, though I warn anyone wanting to follow my example, the school of hard knocks is expensive, good education, but only if you can survive it.  I've spent many thousands of hours digging in on the subjects that interest me most including TA and long term crypto charts and eventually branching out to macroeconomics far beyond what I studied in school.  \n\nNo educational background in computers, just a hobbyists' interest.  And I still don't know anything compared to many, especially on more technical topics and especially on newer ones.  My crypto specific studies have slowed dramatically  though I still watch the charts as they continue to form, I've already answered my most pressing questions to my satisfaction.  There's always more to learn, but you have to prioritize both your questions as to what matters and of course real life.  \n\nA quick starter, this is what made me a believer in litecoin to start and what sent me down the rabbit hole on it: https://medium.com/@SatoshiLite/my-vision-for-segwit-and-lightning-networks-on-litecoin-and-bitcoin-cf95a7ab656b  Given when he wrote that and the zeitgeist of the time, it was incredibly visionary.  Even today, few understand what Charlie wrote almost 5 years ago.",

Blocks come in either too fast (1 min or less) or too slow (1 hr or more). They're supposed to come in every 10 mins. If the next block is 2 hours away, how can you compete with litecoin which would have already 48 confirmations by then? Litecoin is practically irreversible after 4 confirmations. That's 10 mins (2.5 mins x4). Bitcoin cash can NEVER beat litecoin on speed SECURELY. The only hope bcash has is zero confirmations, which makes the merchant do extra work for greater risk of non-payment. Why bother with the hassle of detecting double-spends when you can just accept litecoin and just forget about it?",

Bcash tried to cheat and pretend it was the real bitcoin and use an airdrop to capture all that infrastructure at once.  In some ways the ploy was successful, but signs of it's inorganic weakness started to emerge right away with all the internal civil wars and some delistings.  The zero confirmation strategy also strikes me as an unwise shortcut.  \n\nBut in any case, when you're born with that kind of deceit, I won't trust you again ever.  Trustlessness in crypto is about not having to trust other parties, but trust in the network itself has to be earned over time.  Most people don't understand that this, not long expected supply constraints, are the most important part about the halvings.  Every time a halving actually occurs and no interested party is able to change it and increase lifetime supply, it gives proof to the claim that bitcoin and litecoin will indeed have fixed supplies.  That's about earning trust.  It's a code audit under real world conditions for non-programmers.",

Charlie Lee's 10 year anniversary thread shed a lot of light on what makes Litecoin unique.Btw, we did an LTC vs BCH blog for beginners.

When liquidity dries up and when fees skyrocket LTC is the next best option due to its broad acceptance. MWEB is a great feature and is quite exciting to see on such a widely accepter coin. \n\nThere is a lot of misinformation floating around by people who think they know something because they were in on the 2017 run. Example, calling LTC a fork of BTC is incorrect, that would make an assumption that both LTC and BTC came from the same chain which is incorrect. Regardless LTC is a strong contender to hold for the long term. Most of these meme coins are the equivalent of penny stocks, BTC, ETH and LTC are more akin to blue chip stocks IMO. Buy and then forget about them (or buy and stake if thats you're thing) they will make their safe returns. You dont need to sit on LTC charts all day ala the other meme coins to secure your profits in a PnD. Thats not to say LTC isn't worth trading as it can range over a decent gap at times. My point is you shouldnt feel the stress of holding something like shib or doge when holding LTC.",

To clarify a little further, unfair mining can include premines, instamines (where all coins are mined at once), mining taxes (where a portion of each block reward goes to founders), often lead to ICOs and airdrops, but these are not exclusive to POS coins, some pow coins used to do it too.  It's just worse with POS.\n\nSaying litecoin, as bitcoin, was fairly mined means in practical language that all the coins Charlie Lee (also true for satoshi) got he mined with his own computer or bought with his own money, they weren't given to him by investors or rules in the code.  \n\nIt's normal for centralized businesses to want to profit as many of these unfairly mined coins allow.  Investors and founders want money for their work, sounds reasonable.  But it also makes the resource less of a public resource and more private and controlled, i.e., more centralized.  Satoshi and Satoshilite had a different idea, of global networks for everyone's use and benefit, designed to far outlast their founders.  Fair mining was one of the secret sauces that helped distribute ownership and loyalty to those networks broadly and deeply.",

The robinhood types who came in and boosted were less interested in longer term viability, they wanted retailers to accept it, but they didn't want to spend themselves, and until recently, couldn't because robinhood didn't allow crypto withdraws.  \n\nThere are moments however when people really, really want to spend any crypto, even in jurisdictions where they have to endure the tedium of extra capgains paperwork.  Those moments are when crypto is way, way up.  As a retailer, I'd say think of it as a sale you don't have to invest in.  Instead of marking down items 90%, you can just accept crypto that cost your customers 10 cents on the current dollar.  Similar effect.  Except you don't quite know when that moment will happen.  And you're betting that your customers are already into crypto so their coins have been able to appreciate in value.  \n\nNow if you're hoping for a pretty constant flow of crypto payments, I'm not sure the ecosystem is there yet, especially for smaller retailers.  But if you're up and accepting it already when the moment is right, there's a big opportunity for some extra sales or extra large sales.  In late 2017 when my btc was way up, I did some shopping (I would have much rather used ltc for speed and lower fees, but that particular payment processor didn't accept it yet, though they do now).  Because the bull market coincided with year end and holiday sales, I got a deep double discount.  \n\nLitecoin is a great coin to accept because it has such organic growth over such a long period of time (10 years next month), lots of other coins that kind of pop up and then fade away probably aren't worth the effort.  LTC also has accessibility everywhere, high liquidity, fantastic chain security and great software support.  Any coin you add should meet those requirements so your customers can acquire it easily, use it and when desired, sell it.  And from there, besides the occasional bull market splurges, you should probably think about just something similar to being ready for the splurge on a larger timescale.  Being there and ready when the market matures rather than trying to play catch up afterward.  Some day the demand for these payment methods will be more consistent.",

Litecoin and Bitcoin share a lightning network and every litecoiner should read Charlie's vision statement on that: [link](https://medium.com/@SatoshiLite/my-vision-for-segwit-and-lightning-networks-on-litecoin-and-bitcoin-cf95a7ab656b)  \n\nThe short version as Charlie has reexplained since is that litecoin can always be the cheapest way onto and off of lightning, offering extra onchain settlement and overflow capacity whenever circumstances demand it, and ltc can cement itself forever in a global network where lightning is the connective tissue between chains.  Just as we've dominated old world infrastructure like exchanges and payment processors in this past decade, litecoin's next few decades depend on being a pioneer and staking a claim in lightning liquidity early.  \n\nI don't know how to contribute to this myself other than to make the case that it's important, but this is literally what got me into litecoin.  In 2017 I thought I would mine ltc and sell it for other stuff, then I read that medium post I linked above and I was sold.  We may not be able to make instant full use of this any time soon, but the more infrastructure we maintain now, the more we keep our foot in the door so that when opportunity strikes, we'll be ready.  \n\nThanks to op for noticing and raising this \ud83d\udc14\ud83d\udcaa and if you have the skills and are looking for something important to contribute to, from my perspective anything that helps keep litecoin's lightning opportunity open is top priority.",

You can see what hardware is needed by visiting [RaspiBlitz](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz) or [Umbrel](https://getumbrel.com/).\n\nYou will still be able to run RaspiBlitz's Litecoin + LN node, but as of now, no one will be maintaining updates. Probably not the kind of environment you will want to operate LN-LTC channels with.\n\nBoth links above have a hardware list for what is needed, alongside a router to plug it in to. Not too large an investment if you don't have a spare cpu sitting around. \n\nHowever, you could always just purchase a [mini computer to run Litecoin Core on](https://www.amazon.com/Windows-Computer-Quad-Core-Ethernet-Bluetooth/dp/B09DKTSCT9/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=mini+computer&qid=1632844250&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzOUxCOU5EM1NVT1lFJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTEzNjU0QzcyMDdRUzNGSE9aJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAwMDUyNTExQzQ1VTZVNkFEUVpRJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) and forget about running LND.

Now that I have read it, I feel so much happiness inside you don't even know. /s\n\nWhoever pushed this decision will regret it when BTC's fees make it absolutely unusable again in the upcoming mania-phase. It's literally the same old story. Considering my 7 hour attempt to setup my own node, I can personally attest that LN is far too complex to setup for the average user. That means there's no way that it has saved BTC from the scalability problem.\n\nIgnoring LTC's upcoming use-case under the fungibility umbrella, you can't deny LTC's use-case under the overflow/pressure relief valve for the BTC network umbrella. Sad to see that the Raspiblitz developers don't see it that way. Good luck MF'ers. Guess we'll see you in V1.8.1",

Literally any other coin can exchange to btc somewhere and then fund strike over btc's network paying btc fees.

On top of having to use watch tower services in the event that your node goes down and does not recover in time the cost to close a channel in the future will be very expensive.",

Personally, I believe that most people see the benefits of being their own bank and want to hold their keys in a cold-storage wallet (on-chain) as opposed to on a hot wallet that is managed by a service provider.   \n\n\nBitcoin can support about 2-3k transactions per block, 1 block every 10 minutes, 144 blocks a day, 365 days a year* and that's about 160 million transactions a year. Even with other updates like MWEB which could double the number of on-chain transactions that's still a limited number of transactions.  The fees once the blocks are consistently full will keep growing and people will eventually be priced out from using Bitcoin On-Chain.   \n\n\nI believe the demand for on-chain cold storage will grow greater than what Bitcoin can support. That doesn't mean people won't or can't use it, it's just the supply of on-chain transactions is limited and the overflow will go to IMO Litecoin.",

You can pass litecoin across and get bitcoin out or vice versa through sub swaps.  \n\nLightning as is isn't that easy to use, however.  An individual isn't easily and safely able to set up their own local lightning channel.  There are dangers to trying to set it up on your own, you could lose your coins.  Right now it tends to be a custodial thing.  Organizations with ample resources can enable use of lightning easily and securely, but there are still constraints and complexities.  You need to get your bitcoin into a lightning channel at full fee, slow confirmation before you can get the benefits of speed and costs.  There's a place for it, but it's not as simple as some people think.  \n\nI suspect Lightning in the future will be more of a behind the scenes technology, decentralized batching with global liquidity rather than a consumer's way to buy coffee, and it will boost the case for litecoin, not limit it.  Having litecoin and bitcoin be interoperable via the lightning network gives large operators options when there is congestion and fee issues, and retain a close nexus between these two solid reliable chains.  Think of litecoin as a bypass or spur route, but most importantly as a partner.  Litecoin is a cheaper faster way both onto and off of lightning.  \n\nWe've literally never been nor tried to be competition to bitcoin.  We're a proud sidekick.  Litecoin is Robin to Bitcoin's Batman.  And lightning just increases the connectivity between the two.",

Looking forward to read your mathematical paper with both game-theoretical analysis, price analysis, and probabilistic analysis of the dynamics of such a fork.  Writing up 30 words isn't enough to change a 10b project that has proven itself and people hold dear trust in it.  Did you think otherwise?    \n\n\n>> 4) environmentally more sustainable  \n\nYou are mistaken.  POW is the most sustainable thing to come across the globe; it puts a floor on energy prices that taxes can't.  There is enormous energy waste across the globe that POW eventually wipes out. Moreover, it enables huge sustainable energy investments in one area to be exported globally.  Anyone that doesn't understand that is quite some moron. \n\n>> 5) it would be a bold move  \n\nCopy/paste is not a bold move.  \n\n---\nLitecoin is again on track to surpass BTC in gains, just like it did in 2013 and 2017 bubbles.  \n\n\"Real's gonna change.

If Bitcoin were to become mortally-wounded somehow, I see Litecoin as the coin best positioned to take over in its place without really skipping a beat.  So, staying close to BTC especially in fundamental ways, has value.\n2. Litecoin is a friendly fork to Bitcoin and serves as a solid test bed.  If MWEB is a successful upgrade and well-received, it provides a preview and a clear path forward for Bitcoin to upgrade in a conservative, thoughtful way down the road.  But, really, that idea over and over, not just MWEB.  It needs to remain similar to BTC for this to remain true.\n3. I think the conversion of energy into monetary value is a lasting concept trapped in momentary consciousness.  Energy will become cleaner, cheaper, and more decentralized over time.  If you zoom out to say even 10-15 years from now, I don't think we'll still be arguing about energy consumption in this context, especially of a nascent global reserve asset.  Having POW coins that have thrived over that time period will add to their value, their perceived reliability, their hard money nature as compared to POS coins, etc.  Having multiple solutions for different problems/clients/scenarios is beneficial for a future that we don't yet understand.\n\nSo, I think LTC should remain POW, personally.",

I bought a bunch to use as part of a project to sell as a collectible because I believed it had enough name recognition to be successful and because bitcoin was so costly that I thought it was impractical to use bitcoin.\n\nAt this point, I am reconsidering my decision because I now realize that people just don't care very much about litecoin which is disappointing because, when I listen to Charlie Lee speak about litecoin, bitcoin and the other itcoins, he just makes so much sense and makes it seem like a nobrainer that litecoin is going to be adopted and used by the broad market that I totally believe it....but then I look at the reality on the ground and I'm not so sure.\n\nI guess the biggest difference between litecoin and bitcoin is that one has wide recognition and adoption and the litecoin does not.",

Our relationship is such that we share a second layer in the lightning network and you can transfer value between chains with no centralized intermediary (like an exchange).  Charlie brought that up, not as a consumer facing feature, but as a future financial backbone feature as early as jan 2017 in a medium article every litecoiner should read.  \n\nLitecoin's relationship to bitcoin isn't the same as any other chain's relationship to any other chain.

A lot of what I read I understood better because of what I had experienced myself, though I warn anyone wanting to follow my example, the school of hard knocks is expensive, good education, but only if you can survive it.  I've spent many thousands of hours digging in on the subjects that interest me most including TA and long term crypto charts and eventually branching out to macroeconomics far beyond what I studied in school.  \n\nNo educational background in computers, just a hobbyists' interest.  And I still don't know anything compared to many, especially on more technical topics and especially on newer ones.  My crypto specific studies have slowed dramatically  though I still watch the charts as they continue to form, I've already answered my most pressing questions to my satisfaction.  There's always more to learn, but you have to prioritize both your questions as to what matters and of course real life.  \n\nA quick starter, this is what made me a believer in litecoin to start and what sent me down the rabbit hole on it: https://medium.com/@SatoshiLite/my-vision-for-segwit-and-lightning-networks-on-litecoin-and-bitcoin-cf95a7ab656b  Given when he wrote that and the zeitgeist of the time, it was incredibly visionary.  Even today, few understand what Charlie wrote almost 5 years ago.",

Litecoin consensus relies on every node independently verifying every transaction and every block, without trusting other nodes  \n\nThere are several methods of peer discovery. Operational nodes maintain a list of peers. If any one of these peers is currently on-line, that's enough to bootstrap\n\n> someone could provide a list\n\nOr several someones could each provide the IP of a single peer. After connecting to its first peer, a node receives a peer list from that node. From there, promiscuous sharing of all peers is the main method of peer discovery  \n\nThe DNS seeds are a last-resort fallback - and they're not \"trusted\" in any way which would corrupt Litecoin. The worst attack would be to control all the DNS seeds and prevent them from connecting to any peers, or prevent them sharing their peer lists. This would create a denial of service for a handful of newly initializing nodes  \n\nGiven that the DNS seeds are widely distributed, it would be difficult to interfere with all of them. But, as you suggest, they represent a type of centralization, being hard-coded into the source code\n\n> even ethereum has 8 master nodes\n\nEthereum is not Litecoin. It has a centralization problem caused by blockchain bloat",

Not part of my group at least.\n\n\nThe cryptos i hodl are something i can see the value of freedom, but freedom to make business with whoever i want, directly without a bank or any other middle man.\n\nThe only crypto i don't hodl but i think is a very good option, is ethereum. Gas prices are a concern to me, because i can't invest 100 and pay 100 on gas (or 80, or 20)\n\nThe value (for me) for any crypto is the possibility to make business or value transfer with whoever i want, i don't care if this morning it went 60% low or high, because the moment to use it is not today anyways. 5 years in the future, we'll see.",

I wouldn't go as far to claim how it will overtake other crypto's \"out there\" but I definitely do agree that it's the perfect underdog.  \n\n\nu/litecoin is an old player in the market. People are familiar with it. It has room for growth. In my opinion, it's undervalued.  \n\n\nIf you listen to the Founder's mission for creating Litecoin, he's actually happy with it being the \"silver to bitcoin's gold\". That to me is what makes it so valuable. The bigger bitcoin gets, the bigger litecoin gets. If bitcoin fades away, guess who's going to replace it as a store of value (long-term of course).  \n\n\nWhich brings me to this critical point:  \nu/litecoin has to be careful with it's identity. It's doing great as a store of value & I believe it will do even better in the future. It passes the scarcity test. It passes the volume test. It passes the familiarity test. It passes the currency potential test. So on & so forth. But smart contracts & other emerging utilities are growing at a rapid pace. Crypto's are emerging left & right. Meanwhile, u/litecoin is on the sidelines because it has no dog in the race.  \n\n\nThe dog race is happening on a ship that's moving forward. Litecoin is moving forward (on the sidelines) with the ship while dogs win & lose. The moment litecoin decided to join the race, it will become susceptible to losing. You see where I'm going with this?  \n\n\n\\*Case in point: u/ethereum  \n\n\nEthereum is on top of the Alts right now (it's winning the race). But due to the dynamic market, the sentiment is shifting towards greener crypto's (& technologies). Ethereum's livelihood now lies on it's ability to shift to PoS.  \n\n\n\\- Is it going to be able to do it in time?  \n\\- How much market share are they forfeiting by the time they get there?  \n\\- What if it fails?\n\n\\- What if a better model for validation emerges?  \n\n\nIn my opinion, I believe Litecoin should stay in the \"shadows\" and let the dogs fight it out. After the dust settles, it can better refine & evolve it's identity in the market.  \n\n\nSometimes, less is more.",

So that accomplishes the same thing in a decentralized way.

Charlie has indicated he'll be stepping away from the project soon, and in reality he already has before when he went to work at Coinbase, so it's not dependent on him. He just wants it to succeed more than anyone else.",

Taproot is a huge development and after it is released I expect the number of BIPs to rise.  Separately Bitcoin can possibly afford to ossify as the goto store of value.  Litecoin may not be so lucky.  Maybe it will. Maybe it won't. Without consistent regular development  key individuals who know the codebase will be lost. If it turns out Litecoin needs to adapt it may be too late if no one knows the codebase due to lack of ongoing development. \n\n> Charlie has indicated he'll be stepping away from the project soon\n\nDo you have a link to this? I haven't seen this. It doesn't surprise me but I haven't seen it. \n\n> it's not dependent on him\n\nDo you think that MWEB would have been completed without Charlies recruitment of David and his financial backing?

It\u2019s their third largest asset.\n\nLitecoin is fundamentally similar to Bitcoin in terms of things like disinflation rate and halving cycles. The only major differences are the circulating supply, block time, and algorithm (Scrypt vs SHA-256). Therefore, it\u2019s easier and more comforting to speculate that Litecoin\u2019s price will spike up in a certain way by looking at Bitcoin\u2019s historical price vs its disinflation rate.\n\nIt\u2019s undervalued compared to what it should be worth (compare the Grayscale LCTN trust premium to LCT market price), but people are starting to notice that. Grayscale hoarding it is making people slowly wake up and start getting into it.\n\n80% of it will be mined this year. When 80% of Bitcoin was mined in 2017, it\u2019s price exploded by 19x in that year alone.\n\nPaypal will support Litecoin as one of only 4 cryptos they\u2019re currently suppoting, so its going to be useful for more than just gambling.\n\nLitecoin has stayed in the top 10 list since its inception despite some new kids on the block like BNB, ADA, and DOT that I never heard of kicking it down a couple places. I am hoping for this trend to reverse.\n\nThis is something I find attractive, but its designed as a compliment Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cdigital gold\u201d as \u201cdigital silver\u201d. No other coin is really designed to take that role.",

Many people view Litecoin as a \"testnet\" of Bitcoin and it seems that many experimentations (if successful) gets implemented onto Bitcoin. One of the biggest updates coming onto Litecoin is MimbleWimble which is a privacy feature that will definitely benefit this cryptocurrency. If successfully launched, it will likely get updated onto Bitcoin. \n\nAs a Litecoin hodler who has used both Bitcoin and Litecoin, I can say for certainty that Litecoin is much faster and cheaper to use. With MimbleWimble, transactions and wallet keys will be private which is a big deal. When it comes to using Litecoin as a digital currency, it does a far superior job than Bitcoin based on the whitepaper written by Satoshi Nakamoto. \n\nBitcoin seems to get most of the attention because it was the first player in the field. It's unlikely that Bitcoin will lose its attention any time soon but that doesn't mean that Litecoin doesn't have a purpose in crypto. It absolutely does and there is a reason why exchanges almost always lists Litecoin when they list Bitcoin.",

He's always reminding people that BTC is #1 and LTC just needs to be kept to its basic core. I just heard an interview that he did, and I do wish someone else was pushing development, with a bit more enthusiasm.\n\nLTC itself presents a better value than BTC, technically and arguably fundamentally. Bitcoin has the marketing going for it and also it has wrapped BTC. There is also 1-2 companies trying to add some form of contracts on top of it, although LTC has Flame Networks I believe now tackling these same issues to get LTC into DeFi space.\n\nBullish on LTC, not of big fan of Lee's energy, personally.",

Government intervention - Banning cryptos implicitly makes the argument that cryptos are effective. If that\u2019s truly the case, banning cryptos will transfer that opportunity for more wealth (from taxes, etc) to other places where it isn\u2019t banned. LTC in particular is much less likely to be viewed as a security because it never burned assets, did giveaways, etc\n2. Litecoin is dead - we see things being worked on as we speak with MW\n3. Other coins do things better than LTC - While that\u2019s true, i don\u2019t see one that occupies the space that bitcoin does. So as an example, Stellar is a quicker, cheaper way to send money, but btc to ltc just makes more sense assuming you\u2019re going from btc (the primary store of value). With that being said, i do see stellar and other coins coexisting\n4. bitcoin doesn\u2019t need ltc - At the end of the day, if bitcoin truly does become larger and globally accepted, there are ONLY 21M coins at MOST. If btc becomes a store of value, the point of it almost becomes NOT to spend it. in that case, LTC seems like the perfect next coin to use. We\u2019re already seeing this now with LTC having more volume than it\u2019s market cap",

Dwelling on investments you lost out on is a dangerous game and it can make yourself doubt your abilities. You did well getting into Litecoin.

You are right, that was my greed talking lol.\n\nI've been in since Oct 2017 with mostly LTC right before the run up and have been hodling/DCA down since. LTC @ $32 was a good call for me and I'm glad I did it and still believe in the future of LTC. The hype with everything going on with these damn memecoins/stonks and ETH/BTC gaining while LTC chills is a little annoying lol\n\nThanks for getting ny head straightened!",

                    "response": "Gary Gensler, the new SEC Chairman, addresses this in his 2018 Paper, [The Impact of Blockchain Technology on Finance: A Catalyst for Change](https://www.sipotra.it/old/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/The-Impact-of-Blockchain-Technology-on-Finance-A-Catalyst-for-Change.pdf):\n\n>\tBitcoin is generally not considered to be a security by global regulators or to trigger the Howey test in the US. Bitcoin came into existence as mining began as an incentive mechanism in regulating the distributed platform at the point when the blockchain became functional. Importantly, there were no pre-mined coins sold to passive investors or retained for promoters or related entrepreneurs. The SEC chairman has said that it will not be considered a security. Others, such as the Israel Securities Authority, have said the same.\n\n\nHere:\n>For the same reasons, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, both forks off from Bitcoin in 2011 and 2017, respectively, also do not appear to trigger the US Howey test.\n\nSo no it\u2019s not considered security, at least not by the guy who now has the ability to regulate the crypto market. \n\n>The SEC\u2019s director of the Division of Corporate Finance, William Hinman, spoke to the matter of Ether (ETH) through a speech on 14 June 2018.100 Hinman said: \u201c[P]utting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions\u201d (emphasis added).\n\n>The sale of ETH took place during the summer of 2014, funding the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s development, legal and other costs, a year prior to its first live release of the Ethereum blockchain in July of 2015. 101 ETH was purchased with an investment of bitcoin in a common enterprise, the Ethereum Foundation. Purchasers had a reasonable expectation of profit based upon appreciation of ETH, which early on was heavily dependent on the efforts of the Ethereum Foundation. The Foundation also played a central role in the hard fork related to the attack on The DAO smart contract in 2016, as discussed earlier in this report.\n\n>However, the SEC\u2019s Hinman also noted that \u201ca digital asset transaction may no longer represent a security offering [where] the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized \u2013 where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts\u201d. Hinman explained that decentralisation may reduce information asymmetries, which are part of the concerns underlying the Howey test and the US securities laws more broadly: \u201c[W]hen the efforts of the third party are no longer a key factor for determining the enterprise\u2019s success, material information asymmetries recede.\u201d In other words, as a network becomes decentralised, there may no longer be a group of insiders whose efforts are relevant to the network\u2019s economic success or with superior information that is unavailable to holders of the tokens or coins. Moreover, \u201c[a]s a network becomes truly decentralized, the ability to identify an issuer or promoter to make the requisite disclosures becomes difficult, and less meaningful\u201d.102\n\n>Thus, regardless of whether the ETH sale in 2014 may have passed the Howey test, the SEC has said that it is now sufficiently decentralised not to be considered an investment contract.\n\n\n>This leaves XRP and EOS, which might each have been investment contracts, or non-compliant securities offerings, when sold.\n\n>The token associated with the Ripple distributed ledger, XRP, was launched in January of 2013 with Ripple Labs initially holding 80% of the total tokens. Ripple, the company, has subsequently sold, distributed or used XRP in operations, so that it now owns approximately 60% of the tokens......\n\n>\t.....Whether XRP, EOS and others are non-compliant securities under US law will be determined by the SEC and US courts. Regardless, though, purchasers of these tokens have borne investment risk in anticipation of appreciation based upon the entrepreneurial efforts of others \u2013 precisely the types of economic risks that underlie global investor protection frameworks",

I remember seeing a trade of 10,000 ltc on btc-e for around $1 and thinking that was incredible lol. A quick run up to $7 even more so. So I look at the market now and think how stable it is, and realise what a shit show it was back then- and if you have the capital to trade with 100k+ then you would have made a killing because you basically could be THe price mover.",

The great economist Jevons in his benchmark text from 1875 \"Money and the Mechanisms of Exchange\" discussed the 4 phases needed for the development of true sound money. Jevons used the history of gold and silver as examples.\n\nPhase 1 - Decorative, a collectable with name recognition (starts as humans begin to adore something like the shine of pure Gold or the whitish luster of Silver when its polished or a rare painting or rare sculpture. In my opinion BTC is in this phase now. Perhaps LTC is now just entering this phase or it may soon due to its name recognition and solid dependable crypto history ).\n\nPhase 2 - A store of value (Gold and Silver have passed through this phase, BTC maybe now just starting). \n\nPhase 3 - A transactional currency (Gold and Silver have passed through this phase). \n\nPhase 4 - A unit of account (Gold and Silver have passed through this phase). \n\nThat LTC is the digital silver compared to BTC being digital gold is quite reasonable. Users of LTC can more easily afford a whole Litecoin than a whole Bitcoin and more easily transact with Litecoin for smaller sums (Phase 3) much as with Silver vs Gold.",

Bitcoin is far more secure, but slower.\n2. Litecoin mining uses scrypt instead of SHA256. This isn't terribly important but it is worth considering for a few reasons. For example, Bitcoin miners cannot direct their hashpower towards the Litecoin network, whereas they could direct it towards something like Bitcoin Cash. This means things like BTC miners can't switch to LTC nor attack the network. Relevant because BTC network has so much hashpower. The biggest takeaway here, I suppose, is that LTC mining exists outside of the \"game\" with the biggest player (BTC mining)\n3. Developers might do something unique with Litecoin to make it different than Bitcoin. So far, they haven't. But I guess they could.",

Dex, defi, identity management, supply chain, etc can now all incorporate ltc natively instead of wrapping it.  \nA peer reviewed strategy for scaling which avoids the pitfalls of lightning.\n\nBenefits to cardano  \nNo risk  \nMore use of the cardano infrastructure  \nMore exposure for Cardano  \nA new asset available (ltc) for use natively.

Exemptions, or the requirement not to pay (or potentially report) capital gains taxes, should be on transactions where the amount of gain would be less than $200, not more. That would mean that for normal purchases and use, people wouldn't have to think about reporting, but for anything larger, they would have to do so. If more than $200 of profit was exempt, but not less, it would keep all small transactions complicated and let the larger, material capital gains get away with exempt status, effectively penalizing actual users and giving preferential tax treatment to larger investors.\n\nIf it is simply written incorrectly, and they really mean less, it seems like a great thing for promoting use of all cryptocurrency, including VRSC, the community/project I develop for, as well as LTC, BTC, ETH, and other serious projects.",

Holding will be a winning strategy if you believe in what you're holding onto and do your research. \n\nThink of it like I'm okay with this going to \"0\". NEVER overextend yourself or overinvest, that's how people sell at a loss during bear markets, when they need the cash. \n\nDon't need the cash is the point here. Do research and remember to keep calm, all markets are insanely volatile. Look at historical data, everything you can. Stay informed while holding the entire time. Put it away and forget about it.\n\nNFA (I have been wrong a million times. Just an opinion)",

Why? If you bought LTC in 2020 at $35-$45 and then it goes to $400 levels and you didn't sell anything and ride it back down to $100-ish... Was that smart? I don't know but I see it different after years of being here. You can buy back in at a cheaper entry after these things 2-10x... can't go up forever (See on chain, historical data, trading view, look at it all, look at what miners are doing.... I personally think if you've been holding since 2015 or below that you've got some balls because unrealizing those huge gains isn't bright in a sector where anything can happen any day. Some of my biggest regrets in the past weren't taking profits when I should have. That's one way to look at it. The other is stick it all on a ledger, stack it and hold until your personal \"sell level\" approaches. No one's strategy or opinion is the same OP. DYOR and make sure you're comfortable with whatever you invest. Expect it to go to \"0\" and be happy when it pumps! This will get downvoted by long term holders. (I am one because I stack what I mine but you better believe every single time it hits close to new ATH or reaches old, majority of us sell a percentage of our holdings and realize gains because of how unpredictable markets are. Just my .2 cents",

                    "response": "It was fairly distributed. Remains top in its consensus algorithm, script. Has a high degree of security (cost to attack network is high, though less than bitcoin). Accepted widely, though behind ETH and BTC. \n\nPsychological advantage in being more abundant (actually an illusion much like how 1/2 and 2/4 represents the same amount) and thus offers more people the chance of owning a \u2018whole\u2019 coin. \n\nStill following in bitcoins footsteps although that is starting to change with MWEB which as far as I know, has not been planned for bitcoin. \n\nLiving and known founder, Charlie Lee who I believe has good and honourable intents (selling at top controversy). \n\nLightning network exists (only bitcoin, litecoin and decred have lightning) although it is still very small. \n\nThe potential depends on adoption. Most likely bitcoin will be widely adopted first, but eventually when the public becomes more familiar with crypto, bitcoin adoption will go up as well. \n\nThe main features mirror bitcoin but it differs in target block time being shorter (has pros and cons) and number of \u2018units\u2019 84m as opposed to bitcoin 21m - ultimately an illusion if you understand fractions.\n\nSuperiority is subjective. If making smaller payments is useful to you, litecoin is superior. If you are a billionaire and security of the finality of a transfer is important to you, then bitcoin is superior.",

Understanding simple supply and demand should give you your answer. If everyone all of a sudden has demand and ability to attain resources that means that supply will go down and price will go up. ( aka inflation ). To answer your question ( assuming that wealth means monetary wealth ) inflation happens. \n\nWhich means on a macroeconomic scale, nothing changes. Even if you were to increase supply somewhere that would give you stagnation in labor force, even with advancements in automated labor you would get society stagnation and rot ( people need challenges and purpose ) because humans are lazy and don\u2019t want to challenge themselves. Drugs end up being the only escape of mundane reality leading to more social degradation. The only way this doesn\u2019t happen is that humans as a whole learn to do what is best instead of what is desired or easy, the chances of that are slim.\n\nHaving a forward thinking mind is depressing unless redemption exists outside of human limitations.\n\nA bit more drawn out than your simple question but nevertheless.",

If we use the bitcoin's silver analogy silver is a dual use metal being both a precious metal store of value and a critical industrial use metal, but its primary value is found in its industrial applications.  It only trades as a precious metal when there is political and economic instability but it is always in demand for its utility or industrial use.\n\nLitecoin used to trade as a 'precious metal' but its actual highest and best use appears to be as a utility for transmitting value rapidly, securely and inexpensively.  This is likely why it continues to be adopted as an acceptable form of cryptocurrency payment.  Its value going forward is likely to be determined by the amount of demand from buyers and sellers, and value transmission.\n\nIt simply isn't viewed as a store of value, 'digital silver', if you will, in the way that btc is considered 'digital gold'.  It just isn't (yes, I know, your little brother and Aunt Flo think it is, and there's that billionaire guy in who does too, so there!).\n\nLitecoin appears to have solidified its position, and it is an important one, as a utility token but all the good stuff is happening elsewhere.\n\nThis is not to say that it won't rise in price....you know the old trope that a rising tide lifts all boats, but its position in the crytocoin world is almost inevitably going to slip, probably not into obscurity, but definitely into the metaphorical nosebleed seats but, hey, at least it is at the game.",

A lot of what I read I understood better because of what I had experienced myself, though I warn anyone wanting to follow my example, the school of hard knocks is expensive, good education, but only if you can survive it.  I've spent many thousands of hours digging in on the subjects that interest me most including TA and long term crypto charts and eventually branching out to macroeconomics far beyond what I studied in school.  \n\nNo educational background in computers, just a hobbyists' interest.  And I still don't know anything compared to many, especially on more technical topics and especially on newer ones.  My crypto specific studies have slowed dramatically  though I still watch the charts as they continue to form, I've already answered my most pressing questions to my satisfaction.  There's always more to learn, but you have to prioritize both your questions as to what matters and of course real life.  \n\nA quick starter, this is what made me a believer in litecoin to start and what sent me down the rabbit hole on it: https://medium.com/@SatoshiLite/my-vision-for-segwit-and-lightning-networks-on-litecoin-and-bitcoin-cf95a7ab656b  Given when he wrote that and the zeitgeist of the time, it was incredibly visionary.

I think it may always be around but never catch up and perform. That combined with the risks of being basically phased out by other coins that carry more utility and innovation means that it\u2019s a higher perceived risk for me, and others agree when it comes to voting with their wallets. \n\nLong term i just don\u2019t have that concern with btc, which i think will always have a very strong position.

A $5 fee to go from BTC to LN-BTC is prohibitive for a lot of people as oppose to paying less than $0.01 to go from LTC to LN-BTC, and Lightning is still experimental it isn't battle hardened, and we won't know it is until a good number of years pass. Until then people should be storing most of their crypto on-chain where it's proven and battle hardened and Litecoin the past 10 years has 100% uptime.\n\nLitecoin to LN-BTC via an atomic swap through an exchange like [boltz.exchange](https://boltz.exchange) will be the low fee rail.\n\n[Median Income By Country 2021](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/median-income-by-country)",

I didn't know that most of it was open source. \n\nI guess I can see their point about not wanting to make it too easy for scammers to make fake versions to fool people with. The more popular the software, the more likely that scammers will target it and when software becomes more popular, the greater the risk that some users won't be able to spot a scam and could be conned into downloading a fake version from a dodgy website.\n\nI was put off a bit by the fact that it doesn't ask you to set up a password when you create a wallet, like every other wallet software I've tried, and it doesn't have any option to set a password under Settings - Security. So I thought I couldn't password protect my wallet which threw up red flags for me but now I see that the password setting is under Settings - Backup. Seems a bit strange to hide it away there but now that I know I can protect it with a password, I'll give it another look.",

Bitcoin came into existence as mining began as an incentive mechanism in regulating the distributed platform at the point when the blockchain became functional. Importantly, there were no pre-mined coins sold to passive investors or retained for promoters or related entrepreneurs. The SEC chairman has said that it will not be considered a security. Others, such as the Israel Securities Authority, have said the same.\n\n>For the same reasons, **Litecoin** and Bitcoin Cash, both forks off from Bitcoin in 2011 and 2017, respectively, also do not appear to trigger the US Howey test.\n\n>The SEC\u2019s director of the Division of Corporate Finance, William Hinman, spoke to the matter of Ether (ETH) through a speech on 14 June 2018.

The only benefit from the mainstream VPS is that they should have dozens or hundreds of IPs to choose, and in multiple countries.\n\n* WireGuard install in a few simple steps https://github.com/angristan/wireguard-install\n* RamNode https://www.ramnode.com\n* Linode https://www.linode.com",

There\u2019s a big difference between a non custodial mobile wallet and a non custodial hardware wallet since hardware generally makes sure that your private keys are never leaked while a mobile wallet is a hot wallet.

I won't touch ETH again with a ten foot pole until that gas thing is 100% fixed and why use Bitcoin when, like you said, Litecoin is cheaper and faster. But, then, I go on coinmarketcap and only the newest ETH tokens have risen more than 2%.",

On the flip side, PayPal is a huge company with huge insurance policies and they can hire a team of cyber security experts to help protect your money. \n\nYou could also assume responsibility yourself and buy coins on an exchange and send them to your own wallet. This is similar to having gold in you house. No one can really stop you from using it or moving it even if all the websites for all the banks went offline. You would essentially be your own bank. But with that comes some risk of theft, some risk of accidental loss and some risk of disaster such as a fire or water damage.\n\nSome people feel safe with the former because it is similar to online banking and they aren't technologically inclined. Some people feel safer with the latter because it is closer to the original intent of crypto and doesn't require that they trust anyone but themselves.",

If you're in the U.S. and you use JRNY Cryptos referral link for Voyager (exchange app) you can get your ID Verification approved the next business day.

It is a commercial wallet where Coinbase makes profits through the transactions and so on. You can move LTC from there to other wallets but you will note the block time (2.5 mins) is not meaningful for exchanges as transfers to/from can take minutes, hours, days?\n\nLitewallet begs you to write down your seed. Since we (the Litewallet team have zero access to your Litecoin) you are expected to protect the 12 words and keep them safe.  (Think digital checkbook register).\n\nYou will get your first unconfirmed transaction in Litewallet in seconds and the first confirmation in ~2.5 mins",

The wallet file is AES encrypted. The password decrypts the file. For the user's convenience, blockchain.com saves a copy of the encrypted file on their Web server  \n\nIt could be brute-forced if the user chose a weak password. Brute-forcing an AES-encrypted file is unlikely\n\n> It\u2019s also possible that there has been a hack of the Blockchain.com wallet the past\n\nThere is no blockchain.com wallet. Their service is your wallet, in your custody, with an encrypted backup on their server. This means that your claims of weak 2FA and password cracking are blind alleys  \n\nThe biggest weaknesses in the blockchain.com wallet are the multiple conveniences (also the biggest features for a beginner wallet), and the gullibility of users. The convenience - an online account for a self-custody wallet - is a target for \"helper thieves\"  \n\nThese helper scams have been written in detail elsewhere. Many blockchain.com wallet users deny that they were helped to ...  \n\n*    set up a wallet  \n\n*    or, temporarily change the password to let the helper add a generous Bitcoin gift to the wallet  \n\nThe new wallet helper gets the seed words, but the wallet owner thinks he has secured the wallet by changing the password  \n\nThe gift helper gets a copy of the wallet file, encrypted with the temporary password. He also plays a \"deposit before you withdraw\" advance-fee scam with the \"unspendable\" gift funds  \n\nAs your review states, a 2FA breach is not sufficient to steal coins from a blockchain.com wallet  \n\nAs I've explained, there are no stored passwords. Your claims of employee theft are extremely unlikely  \n\nOn the other hand, the Bitcoin subreddits have a long history of blockchain.com users losing coins because they trusted helper thieves",

He's always reminding people that BTC is #1 and LTC just needs to be kept to its basic core. I just heard an interview that he did, and I do wish someone else was pushing development, with a bit more enthusiasm.\n\nLTC itself presents a better value than BTC, technically and arguably fundamentally. Bitcoin has the marketing going for it and also it has wrapped BTC. There is also 1-2 companies trying to add some form of contracts on top of it, although LTC has Flame Networks I believe now tackling these same issues to get LTC into DeFi space.\n\nBullish on LTC, not of big fan of Lee's energy, personally.",

This means that once Bitcoin starts getting super expensive at the 70k-100k mark, people will start to look for alternative cryptos to invest in and see Litecoin as an alternative with a similar name, causing the price will spike like crazy once crypto mania hits later this year.\n\nIt\u2019s like when the gold price goes up, the silver price goes up even harder. My crazy guess is that Litecoin will blast past Cardano, Tether, and XRP in market cap once noobs flood into crypto later this year. Right now it seems like mainly institutional investors and seasoned retail investors are buying into crypto",

                    "response": " \n\nI already have BTC and looking for coin other than BTC. I pick LTC, here is why:\n\n1. LTC is a finish product : if there is no more development at all from now on, LTC will still up and running for very long time as store of value like BTC. Is always good to have alternative to BTC because not everyone need to move hundred of millions/billions dollars. Normal people like me can move hundred/thousand dollars with smaller fee and faster transaction with LTC. Most importantly it is super secure.\n2. Security : LTC use script algorithm while BTC use SHAH 256. Both of them DOMINATE in their own algorithm. (that is the reason why LTC is more secure than Bcash) prove of work is more resilience than prove of stake. BTC/LTC history prove that.\n3. BTC/LTC is highly unlikely to be replace by others : To be able to duplicate BTC or LTC, such chain need to have at least years of incubation period that no one attack it. Those day are long gone. Any new prove of stake (fair launch) coin will get attack form the most sophisticated hacker/entity from day one. Therefore BTC/LTC are the HIGHLY SECURE prove of work coin that we will have for the foreseeable future.\n4. Fair launch and no pre mine : All existing coins are either mine or purchase. No entity has free coin or pre mine to benefit themselves. Not even Charlie.\n5. Open, Public, Borderless, Neutral, Censorship resistant. (From Andrea Antonopoulos )\n\nHoward Marks once said : The reason we can make big gain in asset is because very few people are looking at the asset. No one expect it will have a bright future, therefore the price reflect their opinion. If we can find something that has very little hype and most likely will survive for the foreseeable future, that will make us huge gain.\n\nIn my humble opinion: beside BTC, LTC is the one who I have confident that it will survive for the next decade. LTC has no single point of failure, unlikely to have bug in the code. Even though tomorrow Charlie run over by a bus and LTC will still survive and running as usual. ( sorry Charlie, you will live long enough to see the success of LTC)\n\nP/S : I hold 50% BTC, 30% LTC, 20% ETH since 2017\n\nI only do portfolio balance at the extreme ratio.\n\nI hope this will help some new comers that interest in LTC. If you have doubt about LTC, zoom out and you will see more clearly.\n\nCheers!",

See Mr. DFV with GME. He made a thesis and stuck to it. He was laughed at for almost a whole year but he stuck to the facts and his belief. \n\nWhat your list shows is that clearly, there is huge value in LTC. People might laugh at it now. But it doesn't make the value go away. Litecoin doesn't have the sheer amount of shills and PnD schemes that shitcoins have so of course you're gonna miss out on some short term shitcoin gains. But one day, maybe it's gonna be with Mimblewimble, people will see the value of LTC. \n\nAnother example of sticking to my thesis would have been me with Doge. When I got into crypto some months ago I thought about buying some Doge because my rationale was that it might become some meme payment. I didn't buy any, bc BTC and LTC seemed like the more reasonable approach, and it is. But my rationale seems to become kinda true more and more. Would I have stuck to it I could have made some pocket change with Doge. \n\nSo my conclusion is: Stick to the facts and you're gonna win.",

Its utility is as you describe, but there is no correlation between being a really great payment system and the speculation market price  \n\nLitecoin isn't accepted by enough merchants. This is mainly because many merchants use BitPay and BitPay ignores Litecoin. This is a good thing. BitPay is a hostile agent, a parasite leeching fees from Bitcoin payments, withholding funds from its merchants' customers while demanding surprise KYC processes  \n\nOutside the BitPay cesspit, a lot of merchants accept both Bitcoin and Litecoin. The only open-source app for accepting cryptocurrency on-line is BTCPayServer. It does support Litecoin. But it is not suited to low-volume merchants who just want to link a wallet to a payment form. Nobody is currently serving these merchants (except BitPay, and similar third party parasites)  \n\nEverybody is saying the same thing about Litecoin. It works just like Bitcoin, without payment confirmation delays, without high fees. Now there is an opportunity to make it work, to recruit merchants. About 100 lines of PHP will enable a simple Litecoin payment form for any merchant. Unfortunately, the \"community\" is full of people parroting these benefits as a justification for increasing their personal wealth. Litecoin is for the user who wants to spend it for ordinary on-line shopping, not for the speculator looking for lazy profits",

I can't emphasise that enough. \nOnce you've run the numbers on a few potential investments, and found one that has a great chance of making you money.... invest.  \nIt's the same with picking stocks. \nYou don't blindly pick one because other people bought it. A good investment has the potential to make you wealthy, or lose your savings, so don't mess around. Investigate all of the financial statements, read about their plans for the future, look at their team and research how successful they've been in the past etc. \nCrypto is not as easy perhaps because there are no financial statements, but there is a lot of information out there, you can do a lot of research, look up their websites, social media, online groups - if something seems odd, then ask questions. \nCrypto is not going away any time soon, so you could perform this research within a couple of weeks, depending on how much time you have, and then invest. \n\nI personally love Litecoin, and think it is a great time to invest because it hasn't got back to its ATH level, and we're in a bit of a bull run, so I think it's going to get back there, and surpass it, hitting a new ATH. \n\nI like it because I've researched it though, and I know a lot about crypto in general. I wouldn't invest hundreds or thousands of dollars, euros, pounds in something however if I didn't have that knowledge. \n\nThere are a lot of morons out there, and I could be one of them, so do your own research. \n\nBest of luck.",

My LTC  was behind at least 3 security hurdles but I suspect a reused password was the last weakness that allowed them to take it. \n\nMy advice. Stand back up and learn from this. I still VERY much believe in crypto, but when you're an early adopter(which I think we all still are) you are going to the school of hard knocks. Ignore the people here who will berate you. I had a BUNCH of people call me a liar only to go silent when proof was given. Good luck and better luck in your next go.",

I can certainly attest to that in the institution I used to work in. The human element will always make funding illegal and immoral activities possible. Crypto just serves to obfuscate and obviously the older generations in places of power are a little easier to mislead and fraud but I'm a big skeptic on the possibility of true privacy. Too many ways info could leak and information about \"anonymous\" individuals leak. Crypto doesn't enable terrorism and criminal funding...it's just another avenue. Decentralization would at least allow authentic control of an individual's purchasing power and in the case of fiat hopefully being extinct in the future(or going through major changes) would possibly replace it as a medium of exchange for services or goods. It's a good exercise in intelligent thought to be able to visualize what the other side thinks for sure. It served me well for many years this skill. Still does.",

Burgeoning crypto regulation is part of the animal that is the fiat system (I recommend you read creature from Jekyll Island, when I read that book a few years back it confirmed what I already knew...but showed me it was actually much much worse) and they will keep attacking to wrestle control from investors back to them. It will be an interesting and painful financial battle for sure. Long term I suspect even more than the usual 90% that's thrown around on Reddit die off.

If my post is a little unclear please let me know, I'll fix it.\n\nAside from the monthly fee. I think its BS that you have to pay $10 to get the card, and if you don't want the card, tough shit because they won't give you the virtual card number until you fork over the money for the physical card.\n\nAnd the fact that when they return the initial $10 fee its going to be in a stellar token Tern. Like why couldn't they just return it in Litecoin. \n\nI just think there are better options out there that doesn't have monthly fees and aren't asking you to pay money just to get a credit card number.",

So if I understand it correctly, it looks like it is almost exactly the same address generation algorithm as Monero uses for their subaddresses, except with a slightly different hashed scalar and bech32 encoded instead of Base58 encoded.\n\nI'm guessing the bech32 encoding will use 'ltcmweb' as the HRP, '1' as the separator, and `(0 version byte) | Ai_serialized | Bi_serialized` for the encoded data; is that correct?\n\nAm I missing anything with this pseudocode function?\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/uwuforever/7caa64e21337ef286bbd701dac1a47db\n\nLast question - at the bottom of the doc, the spend key is defined as \n\n> ko = HASH32('O'|e) + ai.\n\nIs this a typo? It looks like it should be `ko = HASH32('O'|e) + bi` since the public `Ko` key was defined as `Ko = Bi + HASH32('O'|e)*G`.",

Most likely bitcoin will be widely adopted first, but eventually when the public becomes more familiar with crypto, bitcoin adoption will go up as well. \n\nThe main features mirror bitcoin but it differs in target block time being shorter (has pros and cons) and number of \u2018units\u2019 84m as opposed to bitcoin 21m - ultimately an illusion if you understand fractions.\n\nSuperiority is subjective.

Long term value is not = short term price discovery (hyped projects).\n\nLitecoin:\n\n\\- **OG**, created in **2011** as a **clone of bitcoin** but **on its own blockchain** (not a fork like btc cash, btc sv, btc gold etc) but **faster** with **negligible transaction fees**.\n\n\\- Hard capped supply at 84 million coins that will ever exist (21 million for bitcoin) = **scarcity**.\n\n\\- Lightning **fast transactions** thanks to lightning network (shared with bitcoin, also **atomic swaps**) = **scalability**.\n\n\\- **Privacy (optional!)** and **fungibility** thanks to MWEB.\n\n\\- **Security** thanks to PoW through scrypt.\n\n\\- **Liquidity** thanks to being on basically every exchange.\n\n\\- **OmniLite** for creating **NFTs, smart contracts, stablecoins, decentralized tokens**.\n\n\\- **Adoption**, most recently **Paypal, Venmo, AMC, Regal, Newegg, interactive brokers, Grayscale** eyeing a spot ETF conversion, after three months on **Bitpay** litecoin shot to the **top of use, Amazon, Verifone, El Salvador, VISA**, litecoin in **most ATMs** that have bitcoin, **several banks globally, etc.**\n\n\\- **The Economist** put **litecoin on the cover next to bitcoin** for their 2022 issue.\n\n\\- **Charlie Lee**, the founder, sold his coins in 2017 to make litecoin truly **decentralized**. And he's still, half a decade later, working on litecoin and matches donations!\n\nOther crypto might be fast, OR scarce, OR secure, etc. **Litecoin does everything.**",

Litecoin's 10 year, 100% uptime and absolute dominance of it's POW algo with extremely advanced multigenerational, globally distributed asic gear is very attractive.  \n\nMost infrastructure providers want liquid assets.  Illiquidity adds volatility on top of already volatile assets, and companies new to the space will get an earful from customers whose tiny purchases alone move the price of nascent or dying assets that don't have deep order books to supply at normal market prices.  \n\nThe universal accessibility and consumability of liteocin works for both consumers and companies.  Some coins are so limited in their use, they're almost like gift cards, you can't use them or get them everywhere.  But Litecoin has as broad a usability and accessibility as you can get in crypto, so everyone's eager to use it and not worry about getting trapped in it.",

If we use the bitcoin's silver analogy silver is a dual use metal being both a precious metal store of value and a critical industrial use metal, but its primary value is found in its industrial applications.  It only trades as a precious metal when there is political and economic instability but it is always in demand for its utility or industrial use.\n\nLitecoin used to trade as a 'precious metal' but its actual highest and best use appears to be as a utility for transmitting value rapidly, securely and inexpensively.  This is likely why it continues to be adopted as an acceptable form of cryptocurrency payment.  Its value going forward is likely to be determined by the amount of demand from buyers and sellers, and value transmission.\n\nIt simply isn't viewed as a store of value, 'digital silver', if you will, in the way that btc is considered 'digital gold'.  It just isn't (yes, I know, your little brother and Aunt Flo think it is, and there's that billionaire guy in who does too, so there!).\n\nLitecoin appears to have solidified its position, and it is an important one, as a utility token but all the good stuff is happening elsewhere.\n\nThis is not to say that it won't rise in price....you know the old trope that a rising tide lifts all boats, but its position in the crytocoin world is almost inevitably going to slip, probably not into obscurity, but definitely into the metaphorical nosebleed seats but, hey, at least it is at the game.",

A lot of what I read I understood better because of what I had experienced myself, though I warn anyone wanting to follow my example, the school of hard knocks is expensive, good education, but only if you can survive it.  I've spent many thousands of hours digging in on the subjects that interest me most including TA and long term crypto charts and eventually branching out to macroeconomics far beyond what I studied in school.  \n\nNo educational background in computers, just a hobbyists' interest.  And I still don't know anything compared to many, especially on more technical topics and especially on newer ones.  My crypto specific studies have slowed dramatically  though I still watch the charts as they continue to form, I've already answered my most pressing questions to my satisfaction.  There's always more to learn, but you have to prioritize both your questions as to what matters and of course real life.  \n\nA quick starter, this is what made me a believer in litecoin to start and what sent me down the rabbit hole on it: https://medium.com/@SatoshiLite/my-vision-for-segwit-and-lightning-networks-on-litecoin-and-bitcoin-cf95a7ab656b  Given when he wrote that and the zeitgeist of the time, it was incredibly visionary.

Fundamentals: With a low circulating supply, it will only take a market cap of 66 billion for LTC to hit $1,000 each, this is pretty miniscule compared to some of the other relevant coins. We have a substantial tech update going live by the middle of the month, this will likely spark a parabolic move to $1,000 or more. Technical analysis: Elliot wave theory suggests we are about to engage in the third wave of what may be a super cycle. Fibonacci extensions suggest the upside of this impulse move could be over $1700. $1,000 is the conservative target. Trend analysis: after making a double top during the rally at the beginning of the year, LTC found support high enough that the overall trend upwards is completely valid. This is reinforced by the rules that govern Elliot wave theory and the use of Fibonacci ratios. We are also consistently posting higher lows.\n\nWith all these factors in play, it is silly not to take Litecoin seriously for this run.",

When EVERYONE does this the price goes up, simple math. BUT that coin/token is built for this and this alone. Price movement, nothing else. \n\nLitecoin is different, it has substance other than just price. It has a stable network, proven the test of time, security features, speed reliability, adoption, etc. \n\nRanking a coin based on market cap alone is stupid. Its like ranking a company on market cap alone. Just because General Electric doesnt have the market cap of Apple doesnt make it a bad company.  People need to start judging a project on its goals/accomplishments and not on a meme or massive price rally.  \n\n\nI dont know where Litecoin will be in 5 or 10 years, but I can say that I'll be right here, bag in hand.",

When the miners realized that their market dominance controlled the final decision of Block validation, The Litecoin creator pulled his owner card, and he used his power to overthrow the miners and change how blocks were validated; then forcing the Litecoin miners to negotiate a deal. He boasted about how his ability to centralize Litecoin at will is what helped prove that his decision to centralize at that time was right.

No ground breaking developments for new crypto ppl and some old crypto ppl are still unhappy with how Charlie dumped to either cash out or remove any conflict of interest depending on who you ask. \n\n2) ppl call it a dinosaur - it is a dinosaur in crypto terms, which I guess is considered a bad thing for price action, for me it is proof of how well tested it is.  Litecoin is solid, I use it to do most of my crypto transfers. It's not sexy, it just works, Its fast and cheap and has been for a long time. Never had a complaint with it.  Bitcoin at times has been slow or  expensive to transfer, same with ETC, but not LTC, at least ime.\n\n3) is crypto manipulated - yes.  I don't think that is what's holding  LTC price down though.  \n\nI am in a somewhat similar situation in that I got some cheap enough that whenever i sell it probably won't be at a loss.  I have sold some recently but I'll probably hold on to most of it.  I don't think itll ever be 1/4 of BTC like they wanted but hopefully it gets close to .015 again some day.",

Historically though, when fomo hits it happens hard and fast. So I'll keep holding out.\n\n2) People love to hate on PoW these days, mainly due to ignorant MSM-spread takes on energy use. Btc is already greener than most countries, and has a profit incentive for miners to seek out greener and cheaper electricity. Ltc may be a dinosaur, but then so is btc. And ltc has been around for 10 years with 100% uptime... it's a track record that's hard to argue with.\n\n3) Yes. This only matters if you are playing fast and loose with your money. Stay away from leverage and shitcoins. Buy and hold, preferably at least 1 year, do minimal trading. All the manipulation evens out in the end.",

If you want to, diversify a bit, I know what you mean by LTC being stagnant.. but, I think it's coming soon and the wait will soon be over.

Being still strongly in the top 20 after 10 years proved its legitimacy as a real project on the long run, so a safer investment than others coins that usually die after 4 years.\n2. Received a better spotlight from mainstream news channel with BTC & ETH instead of others coins, giving it publicity & showing it as one of the 3 investment to do.\n3. Still room for development.\n4. Being still this cheap & far from its ATH, investors might think this is a coin that has a delayed rise, so another chance to catch the bull train before it goes up.\n\n\\-\n\n* Downside:\n\n1. LTC market cap rank has only been getting lower & while BTC, ETH broke their ATH, LTC barely got back to 50% of its own.\n2. Even in the largest crypto community, r/CryptoCurrency the coin is very rarely mentioned & when it is, the community now see it more negatively than positively, like: \"It got it's time to shine, but it's time to move on.\" Or because it's surpassed by new coins that reached the spotlight like ADA & DOT.\n3. For investors, that might be enough to convince them this is a dead project that has no future, slowly redder & redder.\n4. *And almost forgot, hype coins like SHIB have also recently greatly stolen the spotlight too. I've made a* [*post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfhoau/whats_the_point_to_invest_in_serious_crypto/) *yesterday sharing my concern about how badly it'll affect Crypto adoption & if the future might become more & more of those hype coins while serious coins are only getting ejected from the top. Might be worth to take a look at it.*\n\n\\-\n\nConclusion/TLDR: For the arguments, I've basically given 2 interpretations from the same data, leaving us in uncertainty. And predictably the future value of LTC won't depend on us, but once again on the big investors that will choose its fate. No matter our opinion & bullish/bearish signs, they'll have the final words with their view of the coin.",

Earlier this year, Litecoin performed reasonably well in this fashion. In this most recent BTC push past 60k, Litecoin barely moved up as Bitcoin moved up, and it tended to bleed out when Bitcoin prices stabilized. There's no reason it should have bled out from about $210 back to $190 this week, but it has, even as the other alts are generally making gains and holding them. (Look at SOL, LINK, DOT, ATOM, etc.)\n\nIf MWEB fails to generate any interest then LTC will continue sliding into irrelevance.\n\nFYI- I'm holding some LTC because I still think there's a decent chance it can rebound, and the market cap is still small enough that big price moves can happen. However, some hype is sorely needed. If BTC corrects again before LTC gets back near its own ATH (Around $400, however briefly), that's bad news for the future of this coin, especially as Robinhood gears up to add new cryptos, which will tear into one of Litecoin's biggest current advantages- being one of the few coins listed on Robinhood.",

For the long haul: buy some BTC and ETH additionally. \n\nBuy a physical folder and put your seedphrase in it as well as a printout of the recipe from the initial purchase. Maybe even a copy from your bank statement where the purchase was made. Believe me Tax and government is hell when you pull out the bigger numbers. Be prepared for that. I had long arguments about the history of coins on an exchange that doesn't exist anymore. Headache stuff.\n\n Inform yourself about your tax laws. A trade is considered selling in a lot of countries and is a taxable event. You need to pay taxes to the gains you made since holding the crypto you just traded/sold. Same for staking and earning. It's your responsibility to pay and declare taxes, otherwise you might get in trouble in the long run. Some countries have 1 year hold -> tax free laws, keep that in mind. They want to see the date of purchase and sometimes the route to the wallet you sold from. Safest way to stay out of trouble is to buy and hold, not stake.\n\nImportant with hardware wallets: if you bought it on a 3rd party site like Amazon or eBay, check if there is a seedphrase or mnemonic words in it.\n\nIf yes do NOT use the device, it's a scam where they empty your account someday. Every hardware wallet generates their own unique seedphrase you need to confirm in the setup process.",

So for payment it is way better than Bitcoin.\n\nMost alt coins pump based on future potential. LTC doesnt get much air time as it just works as is. \n\nAlso most people are sheep, they buy some kind of Elon Musk related coin because they want some kind of authority figure to guide their choices.",

I think its BS that you have to pay $10 to get the card, and if you don't want the card, tough shit because they won't give you the virtual card number until you fork over the money for the physical card.\n\nAnd the fact that when they return the initial $10 fee its going to be in a stellar token Tern. Like why couldn't they just return it in Litecoin. \n\nI just think there are better options out there that doesn't have monthly fees and aren't asking you to pay money just to get a credit card number.",

For the long haul: buy some BTC and ETH additionally. \n\nBuy a physical folder and put your seedphrase in it as well as a printout of the recipe from the initial purchase. Maybe even a copy from your bank statement where the purchase was made. Believe me Tax and government is hell when you pull out the bigger numbers. Be prepared for that. I had long arguments about the history of coins on an exchange that doesn't exist anymore. Headache stuff.\n\n Inform yourself about your tax laws. A trade is considered selling in a lot of countries and is a taxable event. You need to pay taxes to the gains you made since holding the crypto you just traded/sold. Same for staking and earning. It's your responsibility to pay and declare taxes, otherwise you might get in trouble in the long run. Some countries have 1 year hold -> tax free laws, keep that in mind. They want to see the date of purchase and sometimes the route to the wallet you sold from. Safest way to stay out of trouble is to buy and hold, not stake.\n\nImportant with hardware wallets: if you bought it on a 3rd party site like Amazon or eBay, check if there is a seedphrase or mnemonic words in it.\n\nIf yes do NOT use the device, it's a scam where they empty your account someday. Every hardware wallet generates their own unique seedphrase you need to confirm in the setup process.",

It\u2019s just a shady ass broker with like 20b on their balance books. It doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t want to spend the coin, holding it in a secure crypto wallet where you can see your address and send/receive transactions on the blockchain and not in some broker who just shows you the numbers and limits selling at peaks is going to make sure you are able to buy/sell when you want and not based on their \u201cserver performance\u201d is the way to go. Not your keys, not your coins. (I know exchange apps like Coinbase and Binance are not really your keys, but you can send to a cold wallet or one on your PC this way to take the coin off exchange)",

If possible don't write then anywhere on your pc otherwise if you have a keylogger or malware your funds could be stolen. So write them on paper or somewhere safe. \n\nOne you have the wallet installed you can do a small test transfer from coinbase to your wallet to see if you a comfortable with the process. Bitcoin and Eth fees will probably be quite high at the moment but if you're buying Litecoin it should be a lot less. \n\nWelcome to crypto and good luck.",

Clunky and full of scams. Things like mtgox left deep scars on the community, and we still hear stories about random exchanges stealing coins. But a publicly traded company making the kinds of profits that coinbase is stealing from their customers would be a truly stupid move",

BlockFi doesn't say so on their site or app, and their support won't respond, so it's up to us to educate ourselves. You need to use legacy format addresses, which most wallets don't support. Consider this before giving BlockFi your coins. If your address starts with ltc that is the newer format and will not work. I had to transfer the coins to another exchange (Celsius Network), which does offer the option to use the legacy format.",

Hardware wallets are cool too. You should probably use Coinbase and 2fa because they are insured or have customer service. Idk. What if stock bear market rolls around and the app goes bankrupt and you can\u2019t withdraw your currency and then ten years later your like I woulda had 40 mil.

While it's nice to see that they are moving towards working with crypto, I don't think any of them yet offer you the ability to withdraw your crypto, so I just wouldn't use them for now.    \n\n\nCrypto exchanges to look into in the USA are: Coinbase pro, binance .US. crypto. com, Gemini, and Kraken.  There are a couple others you can use, and several more non-KYC exchanges (these exchanges don't deal in fiat at all but can be good for swapping between cryptos).    \n\n\nIf you have a lot of crypto you probably want to hold it yourself.  Unlike stock apps, exchanges will let you send your crypto wherever you want.  So you can send it to another exchange, a wallet you control, a friend, etc.    \n\n\nIf you just want to expose your investment portfolio to the crypto market a bit, I suppose SoFi, robinhood, etc would work.

I knew that I wouldn't be able to send GBP over to an exchange fast enough, so I took the hit and bought \u00a3510 of LTC, with \u00a320 fees.

But when that changes, and it will, blockchain domains will be there to make payments easier. Kinda the same way when regular domain replaced IP addresses and boosted internet adoption.\n\nAlso, payments are going to be just one use case of blockchain domains. You can also build censorship-resistant websites and there is a lot more in the works. :)",

Those records can be anything, cryptocurrency addresses (for payments), IPFS hash or DNS records (for websites), email address, anything.\n\nAn app then reads the blockchain, finds the correct records and resolves them. A wallet will look up cryptocurrency addresses to resolve them for payments, a browser would look up the IPFS hash/DNS records to resolve them and show the website.\n\nAll those features will be possible with blockchain domains but it will take some time.\n\nHopefully that makes sense, let me know if you have more questions!",

Do you have any concerns about drawing in crowds of content that may be morally reprehensible (CP, hate speech, terrorism, etc).\n\nGiven the current issues we're seeing with Parler and AWS it seem pertinent to the conversation. I can understand the desire to not be the gatekeeper/judge of content, but the reputation that any company may gain, especially if they become primarily known for that content, may be concerning.\n\nWithout getting political, let's use CP as the example. Does UnstoppableDomains have any concern or plans for what to do if they become known as the \"domain provider for CP\" similar to how the Tor Network's primarily gained a reputation for the unseedy?\n\n\nI like the idea of Unstoppable Domains especially for simplifying crypto addresses, and think that's a great use-case. While the idea of uncentralized domains is also valid, I worry that by trying to cover these two use-cases under the same project, there may be a cross-contamination that prevents the first from being useful as well.\n\nCheers!",

This is their choice. The important thing is that you as a user are in control of your assets and data and you can choose to take those assets and use a different platform if you don't like the decision your apps take. Right now, one or two companies are making these decisions for the entire world. That is a dangerous dynamic. We need healthy competition for moderation. Also, if some content is almost universally seen as bad, we expect that it will mostly be hidden from the internet because 99.9% of apps won't resolve it.

It's different with Coinbase because you technically are handling coins that you can transfer to a private wallet, but with Paypal, they're not giving you access to coins at all, similar to Robinhood. I'd look into getting your 'coins' away from Paypal. I'd move them NOW so you're not dealing with multiple accounts. Trust me, I did this and it got confusing QUICK.\n\nAlso, why does it matter the volatility of the coins if they're on paypal or not. If you hold real bitcoin, they stay bitcoin, regardless of price. Holding them in one place doesn't change anything (Unless you aren't actually buying coins, it's more like an IOU, which I believe you're experiencing with the payment clearing).",

Someone else listed some reputable ones already. \n\nOnce you buy the coins back on one of the exchanges, you will be able to send them to your own wallet.\n\nYou can then get a software wallet on your PC, phone, tablet, etc or a hardware wallet(Trezor Ledger etc)\n\nI personally have a Trez and use the software wallet Exodus because they pair together.\n\nLedger recently had a massive data hack and a lot of their people have been feeling the fallout. Coins are find but a lot of people got doxxed.(not saying this cant happen with Trez either, if you want MAX anonymity, you would pay with a prepaid card, po box, not your name.)\n\nIts all what you feel YOU NEED for your security. A hardware wallet isnt that expensive, 50-150 USD, and that 50-150 is totally worth it when its protecting something of yours that could be 10x 50x 100x what you paid to protect it.\n\nAlso if you get a hardware wallet. NEVER ENTER THE SEED PHRASE ONTO ANYTHING BUT THE DEVICE ITSELF.\n\nNo company you bought it off of is going to ask for it. EVER. If someone or something asks for the seed other than  the device itself. Its a scam, and you will realize faster than it takes you to blink once you goto look at your balances.",

A bank for example only has insurance for up to $250k per client and there are restrictions on how much can be transferred on short notice without notifying the authorities.  These limitations aren\u2019t often harped about but they do exist. And if a bank goes under, the economy crashes or a major hack occurs then they can easily stop people from withdrawing money en masse. This sort of action to stop a bank run is not uncommon when the developed world has a recession.\n\nSoooo. In that sense robinhood or PayPal or coinbase are no different then a bank. You can spend the money or not but if shit hits the fan then they can technically block you out and if everything gets stolen then your only recourse will probably be their insurance policy. And all three have different levels of limitation too. I don\u2019t think RH even lets you withdraw your LTC so in some ways it\u2019s safer but in others it\u2019s being treated like a stock and has no value to you unless sold. Whereas coinbase you can transfer it out and even send to a vendor if you wanted to pay in LTC. But it is still like a bank in that they have full control at all times.",

The only major risk is that it\u2019s immediately usable and someone could coerce you into sending them coins. Whereas a hardware wallet is secret, easy to hide and just as secure.",

Dex, defi, identity management, supply chain, etc can now all incorporate ltc natively instead of wrapping it.  \nA peer reviewed strategy for scaling which avoids the pitfalls of lightning.\n\nBenefits to cardano  \nNo risk  \nMore use of the cardano infrastructure  \nMore exposure for Cardano  \nA new asset available (ltc) for use natively.

The encryption would be based on 2+ strings, which will be 2+ different salts for the LTC Password.  Then the address is secured.  - You would then just need to store the 2 unique strings in your Will.  It keeps the 3rd party secure as a holder without actually knowing anything.  \n\n\\- Its generally a dumb-text storage  \n\\- Then on request you can get the address and the encoding.  You can decrypt locally which result in the password for your ltc address, a more complex string.\n\nFrom there you can submit the pw + ltc address to do transactions, sell it off etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts not a bad option for a Will because it would not directly give the address secret out, and would be uniquely designed for a bunch of people.  It also would allow a more human readable set of strings which will be used in decryption.  FOR EXAMPLE:  If your will is a worddoc, the entire text content of the Will itself could be the password piped into this description where if 1 punctuation if off, one space is mis-placed, it will not be able to decrypt the secret for your LTC Wallet.",

I've been investing in Litecoin since 2015, this is definitely the most exciting it's been with the Mimblewimble integration coming up especially, and the various crypto companies and services sprouting up, even in the midst of this smash down. But the truth is that Litecoin is not meant to be exciting, but to just work and have a real purpose, i.e. to be silver to Bitcoin's gold. And that is proven with the longest uptime of any project, even Bitcoin. Litecoin will always be faster and have cheaper fees than Bitcoin (even with LN) and that is where it shines. On the mining side, it's never been better either. The Apollo is a great machine and very efficient, but also enables individuals to get into asic mining, not industrial mining farms. And the full node is coming up which will eventually enable solo mining to further decentralize things. For the first time Litecoin is not a boring project, which is a welcome change.",

It's faster and easier to get a transaction through as well, and I like the potential for it to grow even more. Things like Mimblewimble, I think, are solid attempts to have Litecoin diverge from Bitcoin while still maintaining some of the good qualities. I just think the community needs to take a stronger role in facilitating the success of the coin. The main reason it's not near it's potential is because the community has taken a backseat to Charlie, waiting on him to do things. We need more grassroot support to get things going, I think.",

Sorry just trying to see the legitimacy in this. \n\nAnd also I work as a senior account executive specializing in advertising sales for a Radio and Digital marketing company.\n\nEdit: I read the article and it still leaves some flaws. This is a brand new country station with 1 FM and 1 AM Translator. So it is only one station with a 1,000 watt signal. That may only give you like a 30 mile radius of coverage, if that. As well as know digital signal to stream online. While it\u2019s an awesome concept, and I am sure it will do great in the future. It\u2019s still brand new. I think 6K a month for whatever you\u2019re getting is also a little too much for a brand new station.",

Singers will be coming in to the station live, Polow's reputation and pull are already being felt with attention in the industry to this venture. What local radio station do you know that gets interviewed by Billboard and Rolling Stone before playing a single song? Variety, etc will follow.\n\nThe national attention is already there, and will also be talked about during CMA week this week in Nashville...which itself was strategic. \n\nThe long term strategic partnership will go well beyond the ads, as well. \n\nThanks for the questions.

                    "response": "# Github README\n---------------\n\n[From their Github README.md](https://github.com/omnilite/omnilite)\n\n## What is the Omni Layer\n\n> The Omni Layer is a communications protocol that uses the Litecoin block chain to enable Smart Properties (tokens) and a Decentralized Exchange. A common analogy that is used to describe the relation of the Omni Layer to Litecoin is that of HTTP to TCP/IP: HTTP, like the Omni Layer, is the application layer to the more fundamental transport and internet layer of TCP/IP, like Litecoin.\n\n## What is OmniLite\n\n> OmniLite is a fast, portable Omni Layer implementation that is based off the Litecoin codebase (currently 0.18.1). This implementation requires no external dependencies extraneous to Litecoin, and is native to the Litecoin network just like other Litecoin nodes. It currently supports a wallet mode and is seamlessly available on three platforms: Windows, Linux and MacOS. Omni Layer extensions are exposed via the JSON-RPC interface. Development has been consolidated on the OmniLite product, and it is the reference client for the Omni Layer.\n\n## Current feature set:\n\n* Broadcasting of simple send (tx 0) [doc](src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_send), and send to owners (tx 3) [doc](src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_sendsto)\n\n* Obtaining a Omni Layer balance [doc](src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_getbalance)\n\n* Obtaining all balances (including smart property) for an address [doc](src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_getallbalancesforaddress)\n\n* Obtaining all balances associated with a specific smart property [doc](src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_getallbalancesforid)\n\n* Retrieving information about any Omni Layer transaction [doc](src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_gettransaction)\n\n* Listing historical transactions of addresses in the wallet [doc](src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_listtransactions)\n\n* Retrieving detailed information about a smart property [doc](src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_getproperty)\n\n* Retrieving active and expired crowdsale information [doc](src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_getcrowdsale)\n\n* Sending a specific FTC amount to a receiver with referenceamount in `omni_send`\n\n* Creating and broadcasting transactions based on raw Omni Layer transactions with `omni_sendrawtx`\n\n* Functional UI for balances, sending and historical transactions\n\n* Creating any supported transaction type via RPC interface\n\n* Support for class B (multisig) and class C (op-return) encoded transactions\n\n* Support of unconfirmed transactions\n\n* Creation of raw transactions with non-wallet inputs\n\n# My Interpretation\n-------------------\n\n[They also have an API](https://api.omnilite.org/) available for communicating with a node. The API is reminicent of similar variations seen on Ethereum and Ethereum DApps. You can see that correlation once you make that connection.\n\nIMO, Omni looks like a Layer 1 solution for the Litecoin network. They already have a few projects that launched that I can't remember off the top of my head right now; However, it's basically as advertised. My assumption would be that it isn't as verbose as Ethereum considering the fact that Ethereum is essentially a Virtual Machine I.E. the EVM.\n\nIn simple terms, Omni is just a protocol to communicate with Litecoin nodes. Just like HTTP is a protocol to serve Web Pages/Apps with a Server/Client setup which is what they state in the \"What is the Omni Layer\" section.\n\nIf we want to nit pick the semantics then Communicating via an API is very different than communicating with a Semi-Turing Complete Virtual Von Nueman Architecture; I.E. a [Turing Complete Language](https://aly.arriqaaq.com/turing-completenes-ethereum-bitcoin/). \n\nIn plain english, this basically means that Ethereum uses Solidity (a programming language) while Omni uses an API which is language agnostic. In either case, programming for stuff like this can be a task because a lot of the library support needed to build something easily for on boarding devs is missing from the ecosystem. Ethereum already has a vibrant coding community while Litecoin has yet to grow this type of traction. Only time will tell though.\n\nI am rooting for Litecoin in it's own right. There's room for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum as well as others too. I tend to favor Bitcoin and still can see the potential value in other networks as well.\n\nEDITS: \n------\n\n- Fix typos\n- Fix formatting\n- Fix sectioning\n- Fix underlining main sections",

They are Turing Complete, so I can use them anywhere they're applicable.

Omnilite is based on omnilayer, the same tech that allows tokens like usdt to move on the bitcoin network.  You can use omnilite of course to issue non-native tokens, anyone can, there are a couple dozen mostly joke/test tokens issued so far, can't find the link to view them by name, but hopefully someone will post the link.  \n\nHere's a user created guide to creating tokens: https://www.reddit.com/r/LitecoinMarkets/comments/po8c3t/omni_shitcoin_creation_guide/  \n\nomniliteNFTs are unavailable in the current software implementation last I checked because they're still building the auction functionality to accompany it.  You could issue them, but you'd have to compile your own version of omnilite and you wouldn't be able to do much with them.  \n\nWhat are the benefits?  For one, stablecoins, which often run on multiple chains, would do very well on ltc because it is so affordable, generate fees for miners, continue to help build and increase infrastructure and network effects that ltc has thrived on.  Think of stablecoins as another users of litecoin, just like you are, just like exchanges are, payment processors, trusts, we're all users.  Think of other potential assets similarly.  More users are good.  \n\nPersonally, I remain hopeful that under the smart contracts umbrella, a litecoin name service might become available from ltcf, serving not only as a convenience for users who want a public address replacement like spritefire.ltc, but also as a fundraising mechanism for the foundation: [read more here](https://twitter.com/seaoflite/status/1470927882822242307)",

I wish I had some valuable information to share about getting involved in NFTs but what I have learned so far is that it in its infancy and the platforms and technology to  share NFTs are not perfect and the market is fresh and probably weary as it is still so new to consumers. I had absolutely no idea what I was getting into posting on NFTs and it was not cheap (cost considerable ETH on some platforms.) I\u2019m not in it to make a living. I love original art and it\u2019s a modern way to put creative thoughts \u201con paper\u201d and into the blockchain so there will always be an \u201coriginal\u201d. If you are getting into creating NFT artI wish you best and have fun with it!",
