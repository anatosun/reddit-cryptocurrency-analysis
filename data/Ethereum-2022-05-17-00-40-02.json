This ultra-low transaction rate was acceptable when the technology was in development, but does not scale to meet the current demand.\n\nThis is a bit confused. PoW might affect the lowest viable *block time* but block time has nothing to do with throughput (transactions per second). You can totally have a high-throughput PoW chain; the problem is just centralization risk.",

You have some people running 15-pageviews-a-month sites and they put it behind a cloudflare proxy 'for protection' and because its on the free tier, and because they want to feel 'big'. Pointing out that cloudflare is bad for the internet feels like a personal attack to them and their little website.\n2. The people that are running large hit count sites probably cant remember stuff like [this](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/opinions/inside-the-fastly-outage-a-firm-reminder-on-internet-redundancy/) - or just want to bury their heads in the sand. Yes folks, it may be convenient, but its also bad for the security of the internet.\n2. Elsewhere in this thread you have some folk asking 'wow so does this mean cloudflare can run our nodes/validators for us'? as though its some kind of good thing, completely ignoring the danger of having one private company being a large part of the network (i.e. its now open to regulation by governments since they have a company to attack). Just wait til cloudflare is running 35% of nodes for some chain. Legally force them offline, and then you only need to do a 16% attack on what remains of the network to kill it (instead of a 51% attack)\n3. Given that most of the people on the planet are now regularly carrying tens of gigabytes of spare storage space and a high speed connection **in their pockets** - the best solution for caching and CDNing high traffic sites would be an peer-to-peer open dynamic framework that their phones can be a part of, possibly even taking advantage of blockchain-based ideas allowing trust groups etc. allowing clusters of data to literally spread out or roam around the planet to be close to where they are needed - **thats** the future of CDN and caching, not inflating these massive companies to become single-points-of-failure and then congratulating ourselves for doing so.",

Such ruling requires or authorizes the carrying out of certain steps by one or more parties to a case. A court order must be signed by a judge; some jurisdictions may also require it to be notarized. The content and provisions of a court order depend on the type of proceeding, the phase of the proceedings in which they are issued, and the procedural and evidentiary rules that govern the proceedings.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",
