Custodial wallets seem to work the best but that defeats the purpose of \"permissionless\" when eventually it gets cost prohibitive to interact with the base layer.  Also, with widespread adoption LN requires BTC to scale.  The developers have said as much since day one.  Obviously the powers that be do not intend for BTC to scale so long term it's all pointless.  I use what works, and has worked consistently for years, BCH.  It's the Bitcoin I signed up for back in the day.  \n\nu/chaintip",
