I get info and entertainment out of contrary subs as well as the blindingly pro subs. I wish people had a more reasonable outlook. I like that we have winter in Canada but it's also cold and it can suck come March. If you are wayyy too in to winter and tweet about how awesome winter is 34 times a day and unfollow anyone who doesn't love winter, I'd say you are a bit fucked. If you hate winter so much that you make weekly anti winter YouTube videos and a subreddit called fuck winter where you mod the shit out of pro winter posts, you are also fucked. In both cases, your friends would likely step in and say what's up with the winter shit dude, are you ok? There's a reasonable spectrum to display your feelings about winter. There is an unreasonable spectrum to display your feelings about Bitcoin which most people live on the outer edges of.",

Also comment in, r/DeFi, r/CC, r/BTC with sometimes popular and sometimes controversial opinions.  \n\nA couple of points I guess I'd preface with:\n\nI've got a background in finance and economics and have worked in financial markets and banking.  I'm pretty well read on crypto, but outside of a few very niche use cases, I don't think it's anywhere nearly close to providing the same level of utility as fiat and traditional finance.  I think its very nature of decentralisation is the same reason it can't replace a functioning banking system (no centralised risk taker to undertake maturity transformation).  I also think a huge reason for the growth trajectory over the last couple of years is a function of excess liquidity in financial markets combined with irrational exuberance and FOMO.  \n\nThere's a lot of people out there that are far smarter and better informed than I am that think crypto is the future.  There's also a whole bunch of people smarter and better educated than me that think it's a house of cards built on FOMO without a great deal of underlying utility. \n\nI think the strongest arguments in favour of crypto relate to the politics and philosophy of it - that the government should not control the money supply and institutions aren't to be trusted.  These are fair arguments, I just fundamentally disagree with them.  \n\n\nAs far as r buttcoin itself, I've never seen anyone banned for debating in good faith, so instead of posting support group threads like this in your echo chamber and looking for a pat on the back, come over and have a discussion some time.  Calling people stupid or ignorant like you are, without really providing any reasons, probably suggestions you're somewhere in the Dunning-Kruger zone...",

But my thinking is that because of the nature of bitcoin, there always bound to be permanent losses from people loosing their seed phrases and wallet access or just dying with their bitcoins.\n\nBut then I thought, what about mining? that adds bitcoin to circulation. Even though the total bitcoin is fixed, the circulating amount keeps increasing due to mining.\n\nThe number of BTC mined in the last 24 hrs is 762.04 (taken from bitinfocharts). This means that as long as BTC permanently lost per day is above that number, the amount of BTC available goes down and it becomes deflationary.\n\nHonestly though, its hard to believe that the permanent losses per day exceed 762 BTC, and I'm now leaning towards a daily NET increase in available BTC for the foreseeable future. \n\nAm I thinking straight, or am I out of whack?",

I would not know how lost BTC would affect this logic, but I couldn\u2019t imagine having such an effect as to make BTC deflationary outright.\n\nBTW a good currency should be inflationary, it only matters HOW much is the inflation.

Any adult on this planet can look at a piece of gold and know instantly what it is and that it has value. Its Gods money as some people say. \n\nNow we all hope with the advancement of technology and the internet blockchain will take off.  Fiat always fails no matter what bc it get corrupted.

For example see the palaver of the Trump presidency where he tried to undermine their decisions in order to maintain GDP growth despite the longer term damage to the economy this would have caused.  Managing the economy requires longer term planning, more stability and the ability to make unpopular short term decisions for longer term benefit than party politics and a four year voting cycle can provide. This chap should stick to punching people in the head, he\u2019s not as clever as he seems to think he is.",
