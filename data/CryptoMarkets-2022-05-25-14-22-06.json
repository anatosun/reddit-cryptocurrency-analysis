            "selftext": "We are headed towards   recession, and this current situation in Ukraine is almost making it a certainty. How does this affect the crypto market you might ask ? Well no one knows because  during the last recession there was no such thing as a crypto market.   \n\n\nNow my opinion is that this will be felt deeply in the crypto market because when people start worrying about having to put food on the table and gas in their cars the last thing on their minds will be tokens NFTs and currencies that could crash at any time, and especially in those countries that aren't In North America and west Europe.  \n\n\nIn my opinion a lot of people will sell off what currency they have in order to have cash on hand.   \n\n\nFor those of us who are fortunate enough not to worry about food and gas, I think we should stay in the game but diversify our funds to companies that also use blockchain technology but don't necessarily only have cryptocurrency but are engaged in other sectors of commerce like telecommunications, sustainable energy for example what WePower, PowerLedger, World Mobile Token, Telcoin just to name a few for you to  understand where I am going with this.  \n\n\nThink about it, what makes crypto special is blockchain, and blockchain is the future for many sectors and not just a way to make BTC and other currencies and I believe that these other applications might be more recession proof.  \n\n\nDo you share my sentiments, what are your opinions on this subject, is my reasoning correct ?",
