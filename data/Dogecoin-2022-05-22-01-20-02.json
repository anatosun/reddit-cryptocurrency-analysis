It will take less of a price pump to get your money back afterwards. I am gunning for 1 cent, but I wager that 2-3 cents would be an ok price target aswell. Trust me, you don't want to carry this all the way to zero. Sell, pick a price target, then do some weekly or monthly DCAing when it hits.",

I remember how I felt when I sank $10k into Doge literally the day Elon appeared on SNL @ around $0.63. I was so excited to see it climb up to around $0.70 and then the heartbreak of watching it tumble. I have a Roth IRA I pay into, but this was the first time I thought I'd try my hand at a little amateur investing.\n\nI was depressed for months, not like seriously, but I felt really stupid because I felt like I just wasted my money. I could have put that money toward a new deck or new windows, both of which my house needed. Then I started seeing people encourage others to buy the dips. I sank a large amount of my disposable (not the end of the world if I lose it)  savings, and had I only waited weeks, I could have got so much more Doge at the price I paid. I had a little less than 15k Doge in my account...\n\nAs spare cash started accumulating, I'd throw a couple thousand more into it. Soon, my average cost per coin lowered - $0.55...$0.49...until I had 50k Doge at $0.30. Last week, I saw Doge was in the $0.08 range. I carefully examined my savings and realized if I only spent another $4300, I'd have a little over $100k Doge. I pulled the trigger, and now I'm sitting comfortable with 100k Doge @ $0.19 per coin.\n\nYes, I've now got nearly twice what I originally invested tied into it, but my average is low enough, that even if Doge never saw $1, if for some ridiculous reason it didn't, I'm confident it would someday see $0.20 and if I really wanted to bail, I could break even and sell it all then. (HINT: I'm totally not - not with these diamond hands!)\n\nAnd you want to know the truth? If Doge falls lower, I'll be nervous like everyone else, but I also believe Doge will recover and rise again. If Doge falls to $0.01, I will not hesitate to sink another $4k, as that would have me with 500k Doge @ $0.05 per coin, and once again, if I really wanted to get out without any loss, I could easily wait until Doge recovered to at least what my average per coin was...but I'm sure you can guess that I'm totally not. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)\n\nStay strong, fellow Doge-brother! We're all Hodling together!!!",
