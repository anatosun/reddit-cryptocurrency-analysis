Transactions on the Eth network can easily cost $100+ so keep that in mind when it comes time to withdraw.  \n\n  \nYour best bet is to buy WBTC on the different networks available on Metamask such as: Avalanche, Fantom, Polygon and Binance networks.  All of which have extremely low network fees compared to Ethereum",
