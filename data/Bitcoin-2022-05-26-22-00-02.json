I\u2019ve always wondered this not only because I\u2019m sure in the earlier days we didn\u2019t have these fancy cold wallet( I don\u2019t think correct me if I\u2019m wrong.) Someone who has say like 5 plus coins. They must want them to have the ultimate security so what\u2019re the absolute best options out there. Is there a fancy device that\u2019s been developed that completely stores your coin? Besides a ledger or Trezor.",

I thought it seemed cool and ran it in the background on my PC. After a few days I saw I mined a block of 50 BTC and thought that was cool. Then I was reading forums and saw other people had 10's of thousands of BTC and my 50 wasn't worth shit. I forgot about it for a while after that, then uninstalled the Bitcoin Core client from my PC because it was wasting energy and making my computer room hot. I have no idea how many blocks I mined but it was at least one. I ended up wiping that hard drive a bunch of times when reinstalling and testing various OS's so it wouldn't be possible to recover the wallet.dat that had my original wallet.\n\nI'm not too bitter though, I ended up getting back into BTC a few years later when I bought some on an exchange. I still have most of it. I'm doing okay.\n\nHell, if I still held that wallet I probably would have sold the BTC on an exchange before it even got to $1000. I remember when people were selling it for $1 and thought that was nuts. Then it went to $10 and back down to $1.",

You can back up a \"gazillion\" private keys with one 24-word seed phrase, which is way easier to remember than a set of private keys.  Hardware wallets can generate all the receive addresses you'll ever need.  Hardware wallets can sign Bitcoin transactions for you.  Hardware wallets might have a long PIN and be capable of bricking themselves after a certain number of bad PIN guesses.",
