For any questions on ETH 2 or ETH staking, we have great details here: https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/staking-rewards/eth-2-0-staking\n\nDo know, when the ETH2 upgrade is complete and withdrawals are enabled by the Ethereum network, you\u2019ll be able to send or sell your staked ETH. This would include any rewards you have earned as well.\n\nFor now, you won't be able to trade, send, or sell the amount you have staked. \n\nHope this helps clarify, but do let us know if you need anything else!",
