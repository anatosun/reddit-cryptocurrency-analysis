I also got my first thousands of euros into Crypto.   \nNow  I thought that it would be useful to listen to anti-bitcoiners, because all of the arguments of pro-crypto ant pro-bitcoin I know already.\n\nWhat are some of the articulate anti-crypto or anti-bitcoin ,,evangelists\" podcasts, books etc.? I'd love tol hear what they have to say to see how would I react to that, as currently I am pretty sure that cryptoeceonomy is something, which I hope will flourish in the future.",

Anyway, for the OP: \n\nI am a fence sitter with investments alltogether, but am considering getting into stocks and/or crypto instead of spending all my money on the house. I did some browsing in r/buttcoin and I found arguments against bitcoin that sounded reasonable to me (a know-nothing idiot).\n\nShort summary:\n\nA currency that rewards hoarding over spending is no good for the general economy.\n\nA currency that is voltile in the short term is unpractical because you'd like to know in advance that the money you saved up for 6 months of rent will actually be able to pay 6 months of rent.\n\nSome inflation is good for people with debt, because your salary will increase over time while your debt will not (interest rates aside).\n\nBeing able to print money is useful because it allows you to stimulate the economy when it's needed. Hoarding digital gold does the opposite. We went off the gold standard because it stopped being useful.\n\nAnd to the people who are like \"Dude, nobody thinks you should put money you need for rent into crypto!\" - Then stop saying bitcoin is a currency, and not an investment.\n\nAs a final note I will just add that the carbon footprint of Bitcoin is very problematic to me from a moral standpoint.",

Indeed, having scoured high and low for authentic, good-faith critiques of bitcoin's viability as an asset; the only ones that seem at all persuasive have to do with systematic repression or seizure by state actors in collusion with centralised exchanges, which unfortunately still host the lion's share of BTC in circulation, or else the plausible likelihood that Tether may go the way of UST.\n\nEven then, I'd argue that the 'genie is out of the bottle' where bitcoin is concerned (if not necessarily for cryptocurrency as a whole), and that providing the fundamental value-proposition\u2014i.e. immutability\u2014remains intact, both of these scenarios would only serve as further testament to the *need* for hard-money: thus, bitcoin.",

Its just a super ineficient database. Actually we had bitcoin for years, its git. Git is better then blockchain but somehow cant do what Bitcoin does.\n\nBitcoin touches a lot of fields, from computer science, mathematics and cryptography, to economy, finance, phylosophy, geopolitics etc.\n\nI think most counter arguments spring up because they analyse Bitcoin from single perspective and not take a holistic apporach at understanding it.\n\nThe linked list argument is a clear example of how from a computer science perspective, blockchain forms a linked list data structure which we've known from the 50's. \nBut Bitcoin is much more then that, and failing to ackowledge that is ignorance.\n\nIts like charry picking when arguing with someone.",

                    "response": "Basically the strongest counter arguments in my opinion are these:\n\n1: Deflationary currency is not a good thing. Why would people use bitcoin as a currency if its deflationary? Why wouldn\u2019t they just hoard it, hoping it will increase in value.\n\n2: Inflexibility. So I see a lot (not all!) of Bitcoiners as conspiracy theorists who say that the government prints money to make themselves rich and everyone else poor. Truth is, the government prints money (or more accurately, hands them to banks) as a way to ensure they keep lending to companies who then use the money to keep employing people, therefore avoiding an economic meltdown. Bitcoin doesnt offer such flexibility. I fear if there is a recession with bitcoin, it would be a huge one lasting decades instead of like 3 years. Those who say there is no recession under bitcoin are talking out of their asses because lets face it: how would they be able to say what an economy would look like with full Bitcoin adoption when we dont even understand the economy without it. In the realm of economic theory, if someone is too confident, be suspicious that they are confident only because they are ignorant.\n\n3: People don\u2019t crave decentralised things. Simple as that. Most are happy with how the state is operating in the money realm. If you get scammed, banks give you your money back and people like that. Bitcoiners say all these people are stupid sheep. Oh well.\n\n+1: The bitcoin standard is not a good book from an academic standpoint. It only has a handful of references for each chapter and they seem to reference other bitcoiners a lot. Also, it relies on Austrian economics which is promising but underdeveloped as hell. Also, check out the author. He is not an acclaimed economist at all (but certainly a smart person) and if you look at his website, you can see he is reeeaaally cashing in on the success of the book. Like offering courses and audiobooks and all sorts of bullshit for money. And of course he wrote another book called \u201cthe fiat standard\u201d. Like wtf is even that, I thought the Bitcoin standard would be THE book. So there\u2019s another one? Why? Is there more we should know? Has he just remembered them now? Also his website looks like one of those old eBook places where you pay 10 dollars for \u201c3 secrets that will make you rich\u201d. Not credible at all.\n\nSorry for the long one but the top comment here currently is \u201carticulate arguments against bitcoin ended in 2018\u201d and that is not true.",

A few years ago we started this software business together. He used a fair chunk of his bitcoin as seed capital to invest in the business - he put in over 50 BTC back when BTC was around $4K (we both put in $100K to start and then another $150K over about a year to cover operating cash flow (salaries). This was after we landed a contract with a big customer that had huge upside potential for us and we needed to hire more people. Things were looking great!\n\nWe got out over our skis with this big customer -  they ended up screwing us - I don\u2019t think intentionally but the end result is all that matters.\n\nOur business collapsed soon after - all said and done we walked away with about $20K each.\n\nOf course while all this was happening, the value of bitcoin had shot up by a factor of more than 10. \n\nIf my friend had just held his bitcoin - even at todays prices - it would be worth best part of $2M. Even on our most optimistic projections his share of our business would not have been worth this much today - though it would be throwing off enough cash to stack a decent amount of sats each month. But it isn\u2019t and it\u2019s not \u2026 a painful lesson in why we HODL.\n\nEvery time I look in the mirror he reminds me what an idiot I am!\n\nI don\u2019t say this to discourage you from starting your business. Go for it - just be careful in managing your risks. Especially with volatile assets like Bitcoin. I imagine a loan contract with Bitcoin as collateral would have provisions for margin calls if Bitcoin drops in value - you don\u2019t want to be forced to tip in more Bitcoin or sell if the market goes south. \n\nI don\u2019t know what the value of bitcoin will be tomorrow. I do know the feeling of watching the value rocket up while your capital is tied up in another venture. And I know the feeling of watching wealth evaporate when a business implodes - and having to start over and rebuild. \n\nIt sounds like you are being sensible with limiting to only using 30% of your bitcoin to start the business, and looking to do it in a way that lets you keep control of the bitcoins by only using it as collateral. Smarter than selling. \n\nIf you do find a lender who will do this and go ahead with your plan - I would be trying to set aside enough capital so you can replace the bitcoin collateral and/or repay the loan so you avoid any margin call or forced sale. \n\nBest of luck internet stranger!",
