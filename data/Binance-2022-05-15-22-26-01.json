Buy High, Sell Low, this is the way! \n\nJokes aside, I'm trading LUNA with play money so not going to say not to. Just understand it is HIGHLY RISKY! The coin is dead in its current format, they will try doing a snap shot and airdropping a new token to holders from before the crash but it won't last long term, any project that goes through this, never can shake the stigma and bad market sentiment. Give it 6-12 mths and it will close down in any form. \n\nIf your trading it, have a finger ready for the exit button! Do not be holding this shit coming into any winding back from the snap shot if that gets off the ground....",

I did that then sent those coins to another exchange to sell them for a coin I actually want. \n\n\nWith the introduction of KYC I will be abandoning Binance. I have already move most of my coins off the exchange but there is still approximately $50USD worth of coins on the exchange. That value is spread across several coins all with balances below the minimum withdrawal limit. I had intended on consolidating them into one coin with low transaction fees like LTC and transferring them out but now I am unable to trade them without submitting KYC information. \n\nI know it's not a great sum but it's not nothing. Besides the principal of the matter bothers me, I never thought Binance would steal from me like this. Is there any way I can recover my coins?",

Then they changed it to 0.1% to everyone and I have never had this fees using euros. However, if you pay with crypto you will be selling it for a higher price than the actual market (I guess to make the conversion as fast as possible). I have also pay Gbp, usd, chf using the card and the conversion from euro to others currencies is very accurate and without any fees. Honestly I am very happy with the card and the bnb performance since I am using it :)",

Enable the Safari Developer Menu ([https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri20948/mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri20948/mac))\n2. Switch your User-Agent string to Chrome by going to \"Develop > User Agent > Google Chrome - MacOS\" (Don't worry this will just change the User Agent and nothing else)\n3. Visit Binance and login as you would using Google Chrome\n\nThis trick might also work for firefox users but I haven't tried it there yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Using the building TouchID or iPhone as Security Key option seems to work swell.",

            "selftext": "More often than not, users of online platforms get frustrated by series of pop ups requiring them to fill in their emails and what not before they can enjoy their time on the platform. From a company point of view, no bussiness would survive without users or customers who patronize or visit the platform regularly. As such, platforms do everything possible to ensure they have a reach of more users and to get hold of visitors of their platform by way of emails.\n\nHowever this pop ups irritate users as it ultimately tells on user experience of platforms with such. This and many more necessitated the creation of an all encompassing solution by Mr. M. Michael for Ultainfinity platforms and its affiliates within the entire ecosystem of [Ultainfinity Global Group](https://ultainfinity.com/).\n\n# What is OneStep?\n\nOneStep as the name implies is a solution to multiple unnecessary procedures that can be accomplished in just a single step! This solution helps users to login without the use of emails or the traditionally frustrating signup systems. It works with a simple OneStep ID which shares some characteristic similarities with the Apple ID with more benefits and perks that come with it unlike the Apple ID. The OneStep system can be sub categorized into three working parts:\n\n>*\u2022 The OneStep ID\u2022 OneStep ContactBook\u2022 OneStep ContactCash*\n\n## What is OneStep ID\n\nThe OneStep ID as earlier stated can be likened to Apple ID, however, with the OneStep ID, all you need is your mobile phone and messenger. The uniqueness of this ID lies in its strong inbuilt security password system. The icing on the cake is the fact that you only have to login once. With user permission, you get to be a part of Ultainfinity Global Group, a worldwide ecosystem comprising, among many others; FinTech, cryptocurrencies, marketplace, messenger without further checks, identification and confirmation.\n\n## OneStep ContactBook\n\nJust like other ecosystems, the OneStep contact book is geared towards endemic and viral expansion of the community to like minds. Ever wanted to share a new opportunity to multiple friends, but the manual approach to sending to one after the other discouraged you?\n\nThe OneStep ContactBook allows you to easily refer contacts universally to the ecosystem you belong to without having to do it manually. You simply have to click contacts you intend to share with and just like that they get the needed information. Not only that, by just by referring contacts, you would win while the company wins. This feature is inherent in the ContactCash feature of the OneStep project.\n\n## Why ContactCash is You win, I win\n\nThe era of needless spamming has gone. Just like we are in the age of unprecedented wealth creation and transfer piloted by ULTAINFINITY, the community will grow through organic means without disrupting excellent user experience. By referring contacts to the ULTAINFINITY platform you get incentives per the number of like minded individuals you bring to the platform. The process is so transparent that you are aware of those who takes action or not. This option of the OneStep is however optional.\n\nBy way of clicking and referring, you can click your way to thousands of dollars. The platform gets its interested users while you get remunerated for doing so. You win, I win.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[OneStep](https://preview.redd.it/t4q5xzu8n9x81.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe20529710594132cb51e53e3055c8b318abfb94)",

            "selftext": "**It ought to, but it is not.**\n\nSo, why?\n\n**Let us explore herein some core reasons\u00a0why.**\n\nBut first, a piece of essential background information lay at the root cause. The growth in price and market participation in Bitcoin has further attracted equity city-type investors and holders. It has unleashed a city-type leverage model, now rampant in exchanges and markets for cryptocurrencies. City-type participants and non-city-type participants are now inherently hooked.  \n\n\n>City-type participants in Bitcoin are not Purists. They are Opportunistic Profiteers on the rampage and high on leverage.\n\nBitcoin is supposed to be more of a hedge against inflation. However, it falters because of its debilitating, profoundly unseemly, and unwarranted correlation with equity markets, fuelled by excessive margin trades and related market trading and operations lending, which cannot be easily disassociated or terminated, for the good of the essence of Bitcoin.\n\n**With the support of others, Ultainfinity\u2019s proposals can remedy the state of\u00a0affairs.**\n\nAnd yes, this cannot be made to continue unabated. Whales and Purists, such as the author, must seek to put a wedge to this unholy dislocation by applying long-term treasury functions, reserve pools, greater hodl, and additional novel ways for a greater scarcity to ensue for Bitcoin.\n\nUltainfinity has, as a component of the SLAPA Model design of its ecosystem engine, a unique Ultainfinity Reserve Controller URC. An outsized, multi-billion multi-reserve pool designed to support SLAPA Model & Systems and Ultainfinity cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets. URC will be non-leveraged, devoid of algorithmic stablecoins, uncapped in size and value to total whatever amount possible, and with a mandate to comprise a minimum of 150% of the total asset value it supports. URC shall be overweight BTC, ETH, SOL, UTTA, DIVIT, SLAPA, BNB, ADA, and USDC, USDT, and bonds, gold, commercial papers denominated in USD, EURO, GBP and with an unlimited DIVIT, UTTA, SLAPA, BTC, \\[Bitcoin\\] super overweight purchase mandate.\n\nSLAPA Model and URC\u2019s strengths lay not just in URC not containing leverage but instead holding significant surpluses and a conservative risk spread; in crypto-assets and non-crypto-asset holdings and its exit liquidity strategy. Both prevent the danger of exiting a few concentrated asset holdings, which can tumble due to arbitrage opportunities in rapid market torrents and liquidity crunches.  \n\n\n>The strengths inherent in the strategies of the SLAPA Model and URC are inestimable.\n\n**Ultainfinity can lead the way around the world in\u00a0this.**\n\nAdopting the Ultainfinity way will restore this vital essence of Bitcoin and also prevent being entrapped in liquidity crunches.\n\nSLAPA Model and URC shall ensure that Ultainfinity\u2019s global ecosystem does not bear the horrific risks of market participants trapped in its flagship token UTTA or its utility token DIVIT or its ecosystem model and engine token SLAPA. These risks dissipate and are significantly reduced to almost zero even as some proverbial crypto houses burn down, in the torrent, around Ultainfinity and its cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u2014  \nMr. M Michael\u00a0Founder,   \nChairman & Group CEO  \n[Ultainfinity Global Group](https://ultainfinity.com/)",

You can put it in the \"BNB Vault\" to get some interest.\n\n\\- Do I get BNB staking rewards for locking up my BNB as well the cashback feature? (Other companies do this)\n\nOnly the small interest (and potential Binance launchpad benefits, whenever they have something on there) from the Vault.\n\n\\- Once I have my cashback that I desired, can I access my locked BNB without losing my cashback; is the cashback permanent after I've served my time?\n\nCashback is based on the average amount of BNB in your wallet the last 30 days. If you stake it, it's not \"in your wallet\" for that time, so you would lose your cashback.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo basically, the good thing is you don't lock it up and can move and use it whenever you want, the bad thing is you only  either ger cashback on it OR good interest.",

Gas fees average 0.006*2 (0.12) Its better when there is no burn, If you fund the contract with 0.2 BNB and the contract targets another token with high burn fees the contract will basically waste in fees more than make profit. \n\nI recommend funding the contract with at least 0.4 just to make sure that won't happen. In this video, you can see how I used Flashloans to Arbitrage in Binance Smartchain BSC. We deploy our own contract on BSC to swap between Pancake-Swap and Bakery=Swap. We keep profits in BNB and this can be repeated at times.

I have 2a Authenticator & says only devices logged were my phone & a computer also w/ my ip. I removed the computer ip they said had allowance just cause I don\u2019t remember ever using binance on the computer . Wondering if my acc maybe got phished via email or something . Any insight is much appreciated I don\u2019t usually use binance & probably will no longer since my money keeps disappearing. Also is there a way to see where the money was deposited to following the sale",

This time I got a brain freeze and sent the coins directly on the Harmony blockchain.. I can see the BNB sitting in Binance wallet, obv their system isnt detecting it tho, so the deposit isnt going through.. What should I do?? I tried submitting a ticket on their website to explain the situation but I can't seem to find any way to get in touch with them.\n\nIf somebody from Binance sees this, I can provide adress etc.\n\nThanks in advance",

Gas fees average 0.006*2 (0.12) Its better when there is no burn, If you fund the contract with 0.2 BNB and the contract targets another token with high burn fees the contract will basically waste in fees more than make profit. \n\nI recommend funding the contract with at least 0.4 just to make sure that won't happen. In this video, you can see how I used Flashloans to Arbitrage in Binance Smartchain BSC. We deploy our own contract on BSC to swap between Pancake-Swap and Bakery=Swap. We keep profits in BNB and this can be repeated at times. Higher the volatility, higher profit due to price change.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKhbCpHM2gc\n\n---------------\n^(The) ^(Video) ^(and) ^(Medium.com) ^(Tutotial) ^(Links) ^(are) ^(found) ^(here:) | [Youtube tutotrial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKhbCpHM2gc) | [Medium article](https://cryptomentor.medium.com/brand-new-flash-loan-contract-code-working-as-of-december-6-2021-removed-auto-loan-function-17c7d4bb354e)",

Gas fees average 0.006*2 (0.12) Its better when there is no burn, If you fund the contract with 0.2 BNB and the contract targets another token with high burn fees the contract will basically waste in fees more than make profit. \n\nI recommend funding the contract with at least 0.4 just to make sure that won't happen. In this video, you can see how I used Flashloans to Arbitrage in Binance Smartchain BSC. We deploy our own contract on BSC to swap between Pancake-Swap and Bakery=Swap. We keep profits in BNB and this can be repeated at times. Higher the volatility, higher profit due to price change.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKhbCpHM2gc\n\n---------------\n^(The) ^(Video) ^(and) ^(Medium.com) ^(Tutotial) ^(Links) ^(are) ^(found) ^(here:) | [Youtube tutotrial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKhbCpHM2gc) | [Medium article](https://cryptomentor.medium.com/brand-new-flash-loan-contract-code-working-as-of-december-6-2021-removed-auto-loan-function-17c7d4bb354e)",

Now i signed up to my account, all was fine. Nothing about another KYC.\n\nCharged some money, because i want to play with crypto again. Charged some money, all was fine.\n\nSo i moved to Market and problems started. They need to verify my identity again.\n\nExcuse me? Where was a notification about that when i want to deposit some money in to your account? There wasn't.\n\nThey pi$$ed me a littlebit. But i was fine, i uploaded all my documents and current photo.\n\nAfter 3 hours, my verification request has been rejected. Why? User request.\n\nEXCUSE ME? I was sleeping and i cancelled that request? Are u sure about that?\n\nI'm happy, because my funds are now SAFU in  Changpeng wallet.",

Of the hundreds of services out there, trying to charge for this service, there are probably about a dozen that have a widely recognized name.\n\nThis introduces a new problem\u2013at what point are KYC and audit services just selling a name. How much responsibility should the company bear if they provide a good report on a project, which subsequently rugpulls? Are certain companies trading their name for a dollar? Who knows which audit companies provide unbiased and honest reports?\n\nThese considerations came to mind yesterday as we were reviewing the case of the contracted developer, Bullish, who scammed the Coyote Coin team and all of their investors a few minutes after launch. The Coyote Coin project was fully KYC\u2019d and audited. Bullish, as an outside dev, had been KYC'd previously, by gate . io. The Coyote Coin smart contract received a 90% overall rating by Certik.\n\nThe KYC, hopefully, does its job. The identity of Bullish will likely come out, and he will likely be prosecuted\u2013he apparently scammed upwards of 8 projects simultaneously.\n\nThe audit, however, raises a serious concern for me. The vulnerability that was exploited, in this case, was raised as a flag by Certik. Great! They caught it! Then, how did the overall rating of the Coyote Coin contract remain as high as 90%? That seems odd to me. And after the exploit happened, why has Certik reduced the overall rating to 50%? Hindsight is 20/20 as they say.\n\nThis article is about the importance of integrity. Crypto projects are expected to have integrity, and thus checks and measures are put into place\u2013audits & KYC\u2019s. But what happens when the companies providing these checks start to lose sight of their integrity. When a rugpull occurs, I would expect an audit company to step up to the plate and make a statement regarding their failure to account appropriately for a potential vulnerability. At least make an apology for rating a contract 90% trustworthy, while the investors lost over $750k.\n\nInstead of taking ownership and proving they are a company of integrity in the crypto space, Certik quietly reduced the rating to 50%, to cover their butts after the fact. And then proceeded to attack the CryptoCravers article on the Coyote Coin exploit, which was simply an overview of the facts.\n\n[r/CryptoCraversLLC](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCraversLLC/), we promise to always shoot straight. We will give you the facts\u2013honest and unbiased. Every. Single. Time.\n\nComment below \u2013 What KYC/Audit companies do you trust? And which companies aren\u2019t worth their salt?",

Neither app has JPY support, both are CNY only and should not be on the JPY section. Both are abused by sellers to post rates unattainable by people actually buying in JPY.

Gas fees average 0.006*2 (0.12) Its better when there is no burn, If you fund the contract with 0.2 BNB and the contract targets another token with high burn fees the contract will basically waste in fees more than make profit. \n\nI recommend funding the contract with at least 0.4 just to make sure that won't happen. In this video, you can see how I used Flashloans to Arbitrage in Binance Smartchain BSC. We deploy our own contract on BSC to swap between Pancake-Swap and Bakery=Swap. We keep profits in BNB and this can be repeated at times. Higher the volatility, higher profit due to price change.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKhbCpHM2gc\n\n---------------\n^(The) ^(Video) ^(and) ^(Medium.com) ^(Tutotial) ^(Links) ^(are) ^(found) ^(here:) | [Youtube tutotrial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKhbCpHM2gc) | [Medium article](https://cryptomentor.medium.com/brand-new-flash-loan-contract-code-working-as-of-december-6-2021-removed-auto-loan-function-17c7d4bb354e)",

There were situations where I was in decent gains but didnt close the position with the idea \"let it push a bit more\". I check my phone in 20 mins, notification saying I'm close to liquidation, open the app, I'm drained.\n\nAs somebody already said, too many scened dips in short terms, aimed to liquidate people.\nFutures are a risky play.\nThe idea I'd do if I was willing to mess around again is to try to find a bottom of the dip then ride it up, mentally long positions tend to be better for me.\n\nBut since we're in a shitty market, it's kinda hard to do a smart move as a average Joe trader.",

Think having to explain difference between bep2/bep20 a million times...)\n\nImagine a muffler shop has their own coin on the binance smartchain. Susie comes in because she has an exhaust rattle. The muffler shop in question is offering Susie a giant discount for paying for the fix with the new shiny token. Susie gets excited and wants to sign up! This is where the fun starts... A team member has Susie download Trust Wallet on her phone and explain the risks. But then she has to use her debit card to buy crypto through Moonpay and cant because she just divorced Roger and with AML last names matter. Long story short, Moonpay denies her or puts her in a holding pattern because AML is a thing even though this is a legit person trying to do a legit thing. Then Susie gets frustrated and decides not to press forward with the coin purchase/get involved with crypto. The whole AML process is discouraging because understanding how to navigate the space for an ordinary person is difficult enough, putting this kyc process in place complicates things even more. In situations like this, it feels like this process was put in place to slow down crypto growth.\n\nBesides slower transaction time and volatility, this is a real logistical problem of trying to utilize crypto for day to day. We are of course working on solutions, but I wanted to peel back the onion and hear your thoughts. What would you recommend as a solution? I know it's necessary, but it's frustrating because for Susie to get that debit card she had to give a lot of info to the bank. Why does the verification need to happen a second time with a company like Moonpay?",

Its not fucking worth it. Money aside. You need to control your primal emotions and be dead inside to trade successfully meaning you cant feel anything. Fear and greed. \n\nMoney aside the psychological toll it took on me fucked me up i barely slept for 4 months. One week i had 3 fever dreams... Yes i woke up and saw chart candles on my bedroom walls 3 times that week. Fuck the money itll drain your sanity. But go ahead my dude. I hope the only casualty is your wallet and not a fucking panic disorder. Then again i do have an addictive personality. \n\nMay your SLs be in the green.",

The institution's goal is to achieve socioeconomic fairness, which it accomplishes by gathering, supporting, and investing in API businesses and creatives. \n\nThe newly formed fund from Gold House has a number of goals. For starters, the fund makes direct investments in API startups and raises cash through its API investment network. Several prominent angel investors and venture capital firms are part of the network. Gold House Ventures also helps its portfolio firms grow through a variety of industry-specific incubation programs. In addition, Gold House Ventures also enhances portfolio companies through a slew of industry-oriented incubation programs. Furthermore, the premier fund achieves this alongside the region\u2019s preeminent API accelerator called Gold Rush.\n\nGold House Ventures assists with marketing and talent recruitment, as well as reinvesting profits. The fund donates its whole management fee and profits to the Gold House, a non-profit organization. With this kind of funding, the API collective can continue its important work in the region and beyond. Gold House aspires to create more authentic multicultural representation by uniting Asians and Pacific Islanders.",

The catch is that you are limited to 50 orders per day and as your level increased so the commission and orders amount per day. \nOf course, you can withdraw USDT back to your wallet at any point.\nI transferred 100 USDT (because I didn\u2019t want to \u201crisk\u201d more) and to see how it works, after 2 weeks my balance is almost 300! \nAnd as my balance grows, I make more commission each day.\nI know it seems a bit shady, but I know friends of mine who make 500$ per day by commission.\nSo if you guys want to join the site, don\u2019t transfer a big amount, and feel free to ask me questions.\nI can also send you detailed video on how to make the first deposit and info about the site. \nPlease message me for the link.",

The most epic one on record is OneCoin which rugged $4B the most recent/ noteworthy one in my opinion is Squid Game which rugged $3.36M which was on BSC. Without getting into semantics, there are typically three ways rug pulls are conducted: Liquidity Theft (liquidity pool just gets moved), Limiting Sell Order (developers can only sell) and Dumping (developers own from the start and then sell an enormous supply of tokens). \n\nAlthough still taboo, it seems like investors are actually looking for scams these days. Not sure why anyone would want to get ripped off, but it seems like a thing. Imagine a Squid Game V3 motto: \"we swear we wont rug this time\" :) What are your thoughts on this? \n\nFinally, what are the latest scams/rug pulls have you witnessed/heard of?

According to the exchange, withdrawals will resume once the network is solid and the volume of pending withdrawals has lessened.\n\nAs previously reported, Terra's algorithmic stablecoin, UST, saw a free decline after losing its peg.

I propose that binance create a button where we can hide the Luna/USDT pair; Luna/BUSD or actually any pair.  The truth is that I want to forget that this existed, I would like to get into binance and be able to hide this coin, but still be able to see all the other coins.  I am referring to the \"Hot\" section of binance.  Constantly going in and seeing the luna coin makes me feel anxious and chest pain :/\n\n I don't think I'm proposing anything out of place, it's just a way to help those who want to forget this nightmare.

Via Bank Card (Visa/MC) with 1.8% fee, or via Bank Transfer (Faster Payments) with 1GBP fee. The issue, however, is that to use the latter option (Bank Transfer), you have 'upgrade your fiat service' and then activate the service by activating your Bifinty Digital Wallet, and one of the T&Cs you have to agree to is for Binance account details be shared with Binifity, Skrill and Paysafe! Why do my Binance account details have to be shared with these companies just because I want to deposit fiat (in this case GBP) in my Binance account! These are not details required if depositing by say debit/credit cards etc.",

So no information at all from them.  \n  \nSo it seems Binance want us to guess our way through financial investments. That is not going to happen.",

This seed phrase allows you to recover the wallet and its contents should it get accidentally deleted or if you want to put the wallet on a different device.  Whoever knows this seed phrase can access the wallet so it needs to be kept in a safe place and never given to anyone who you don't want to access your wallet.\n\nIf you Google 'crypto wallet' you can research and learn more about them and decide which option is best for you.",

Only blockchains using proof of stake consensus allow staking. However on Binance you can subscribe to BTC flexible savings to get 5% APY on the first 0.01 BTC and then 0.80% on 0.01-0.5 BTC. Anything over 0.5 BTC has 0.10% APY on Binance.",

For me, I have just put money in dual savings with a strike price of $28,000 for BTC because if BTC drops to that price I am more than glad to buy some at that level. Moreover, I get 50% interest on my stablecoins while waiting for that to happen. Not bad.",

People do not pay attention to the market capitalization of the coin, etc., they just think that 1 cent is real and that\u2019s all. This is a kind of psychological factor. Buying a coin for a $100 or several thousands coins for $100.  .. Luna currently has a market capitalization of 2 billions. If we assume that the capitalization will grow 10 times and the founders will burn half of the coins, then the goal of x100 is very real even from this point.   \n\nThe only thing we don\u2019t know is what the founders have in mind, so it means that coin depreciation is also real, it\u2019s just might become zero. Who wants just take this risks.  \n\nAnd one more thing that I see, the crypto community missed about such memes, the Luna communities in social networks are growing fast and it\u2019s very large rn, and this is another very strong bullish factor.",

It's the whole thing of p2p: the price is bartered between the seller and the buyer, albeit indirectly.\n\nIf you're selling and nobody's buying it's because your price is too high and you've got to lower it. If you want to buy but you don't find any offer that suits you, it's because your price is too low, you've got to pay more. It works that way. \n\nSo of course there are many different prices: it's the free market concept!\n\nBTW: DON'T believe offerings with crazy low prices, they're scam 99% of the times. And in general, BE CAREFUL when p2p because Binance or any other exchange isnt' responsible in any way should problems arise with your transaction.",

No violations no nothing.  \nSo today i wanted to withdraw Crypto, this action requires Level 2 verification, but i always get an error when verifying , that the selfie doesnt match with the ID photo (maybe because i got a beard now).  \nso anyway i always left it failed and kept using my account with only Level 1.  \nUntil today i decided to contact the support to check how can i fix this and get Level 2 verification.  \nSo the support agent suddenly tells me (i have all chat recorded),   \n\"Sorry your verification could not be complete and we have to deactivate your account, can you please withdraw all your money?\"\n\nI asked him why and how?! He said that some rules and policies and i dont what changed in the country (Turkey), and i am no longer able to use my account, and it needs to be closed.  \nIt felt so weird how exactly when i contact the support, suddenly my account needs to be closed, Until i contacted the supported everything was working well.   \nI asked him if i can get an official email stating that my account needs to be closed, he said \"Since we are BinanceTR we can't do that, our conversation with you is our official statement \"\n\nand he said \"your account will be closed, you can contact us again whenever you are able to withdraw your money so we open it for you till you withdraw , then it will be closed again\"  \nHe said a lot of contradictory stuff, i felt like if he's messing with me!

So what will be the trading fee that you\u2019ll be charged?\n\nHere\u2019s a simple formula: (USDT amount that you\u2019ll use / 100) \\* fees rate\n\nNow, we have, (250/100)\\*0.10, which gives 0.25 USDT. Thus, you\u2019ll be charged 0.25 USDT for using 250 USDT to buy Binance Coins (BNB). Simply put, by buying BNB with 250 USDT, you will get $249.75 worth of BNB.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPleaseif anyone can guide me the actual way Binance calculate fees",

And they say this to someone, who used login + password + google auth to log in in Binance lol.",

            "selftext": "TLDR: YieldNodes is a passive income for people with a lower risk tolerance. YieldNodes has generated around 8% monthly on average for the last two and a bit years. It is a slower rate of return for most De-Fi degens but slow and steady is an alternative approach. If autocompounded you're looking at 200%+ from a stable environment 2 yrs proven.\n\nI've been on the hunt for a passive income option that provides an almost stable return and something almost similar to an index fund.\n\nI came across YieldNodes in a YouTube video and didn't really pay too much attention until I got burned and burned time and time again chasing a beggars belief with the de-fi world. I decided to look into YieldNodes again and this is where I found out more.\n\nYieldNodes has been around for about two years now and still looking relatively solid despite a few upturns during the last few years (glancing back to May 2021 and March 2020). \n\nOf course it goes without saying that previous performance does not indicate future returns but they've averaged approximately 8% in the last few years. \n\nI've scoured the internet for alternative views to YieldNodes but honestly its been mostly overwhelmingly positive. \n\nThe team appear to be very transparent, they do most of the leg work themselves and their communication is very good and they've always got back to me quickly. \n\nEssentially you deposit a sum, they then use this to rent master node servers and you earn money from the transactions that are validated on the blockchain and this is paid back to you by BTC. Nothing is traded so you won't be susceptible to fluctuations in price.\n\nYieldNodes policy is that they will return your deposit AND your profits after three months if the performance is less than 5% consecutively. Alternatively you can have your deposit returned in full after six months or an emergency withdrawal option at minus 25% (deposit $1000, get $750 back). \n\nAutocompounding feature means that you can feather how much percentage wise you wish to autocompound back into the fund. Also it has a handy calculator to show you the previous returns over the last two years if you'd invested x amount which is factual because its based from the actual returns not predicted.\n\nQuestions I had were:\n\nIf I deposit BTC at $30k and it drops to $15k (wishful thinking) will I lose money? No you won't you'll get back the amount you deposited to the value of BTC.\n\nAccording to their business model, YieldNodes has 2x the value of deposits in holdings to pay people back if anything was to go wrong. As you are renting a masternode, the value deposited isn't tied to a coin so you won't be losing out if it goes to zero. Of course nothing is guaranteed so there is still an element of risk attached to this. \n\nI'd honestly say do more research on this if it is something you might be interested in. I'll happily answer questions to the best of my knowledge but of a $10,000 deposit I'm returning $750 avg per month and compounding it to generate more!\n\nHave to be honest here and say the links below are an affiliate (no cost to you), totally your choice if you wish to use my sign up link but if you found it helpful I'd really appreciate it. It just means that I get a 5% payout from YieldNodes based on the deposit you put in so if you do use my affiliate link **MESSAGE ME** because I'll give you 50% of what I make from it back as it'll show on my affiliate page.\n\nThanks for reading and hope its been helpful.\n\n[https://members.yieldnodes.com/c/?a=wLd2Q2KA6eoPVYx&redirect=signup](https://members.yieldnodes.com/c/?a=wLd2Q2KA6eoPVYx&redirect=signup)\n\nLink for more info - [https://yieldnodes.com?a=wLd2Q2KA6eoPVYx](https://yieldnodes.com?a=wLd2Q2KA6eoPVYx)",

I\u2019m asking this because I like to set tp orders and then leave the trade running but if 1 triggers and I have 2 the second order for say will be worth $400 to close and the position would only have $200 in it. If the TP order amount exceeds the position would this just close the trade? Thanks",
