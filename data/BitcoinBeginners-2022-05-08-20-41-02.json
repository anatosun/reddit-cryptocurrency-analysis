The 'buffer' method, like mentioned above, where a company maintains enough of a reserve to meet the demand of inbound and outbound requests. This is a lot like a bank, who  (up until March 26, 2020) had to maintain \\~10% cash reserves. fIf the buffer dries up, a \"run on the bank\" can occur.\n2. Order book. Which requires no reserves. Buy requests are matched to sell requests and the company skims off the top for facilitating this matching\n3. Pools. Used in decentralized exchanges. Using math, you can buy and sell from no-one at all! There doesn't need to be a buyer to sell your coins. It works like a scale. Where throwing your coins on one side will tip the scales. Someone will notice that the scales are unbalanced and will then buy the coins at a discount. Doing so will bring the scales into equilibrium. (DuckDuckGo: Automated Market Makers)",

It\u2019s an \u201cexchange\u201d they buy it from the people selling it. \n\nEveryone puts an order at what price they want to buy or sell it (or just agrees to what that mom ends price is) and the exchange matches those up and fills people willing to buy and sell at the same price. \n\nWhen there aren\u2019t enough sellers at the asking price to match the buyers, the price goes up to fill the orders. And vice versa. \n\nSounds like a zero sum game, so why do they do this. It\u2019s because they charge both a small percentage difference than the actual price, along with fees, to both make some profit and keep up with the ever changing price. \n\nEach exchange sets their own \u201cfloat\u201d but they all have to be in step with each other because there are people running bots that look for when one exchange is too far off from the other that will buy from one and sell to another and make money off the difference in arbitrage. \n\nNow for whales there are ways to do this in person at prices and contracts that are agreed upon by people. If you want to sell or buy 1,000 BTC you can\u2019t do that all at once at one price unless there are enough people who want to buy 1,000 BTC all at the same time. So doing that on the market will drive the price up or down in a way that eventually will make you earn less money (or cost more). \n\nSo you make an agreement in person with an exchange to do it at an agreed upon price and then it\u2019s up to the exchange to do it slowly and in a way that they make money in the difference between their cost and the changing price. So every off market sale affects the price but more slowly and not as much as if you did it like you or me. \n\nWhich leads us to the \u201cwhale games\u201d where a whale will intentionally do that big buy or sale on the market in order to drive the cost and then buy or sell more when the price drops or raises and make a profit on the whole affair.",
