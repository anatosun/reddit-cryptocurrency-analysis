If one person sells, very quickly thereafter someone is buying. And when one person buys, that transaction goes through when someone sold.\n\nObviously this is oversimplification. But on the most basic level exchanges are just matching up buyers and sellers.\n\nNow sure they\u2019ll buy when people are selling so that they can sell when people are buying. But for the most part it\u2019s them connecting buyers with sellers.",
