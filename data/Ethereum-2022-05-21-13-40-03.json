They have low fees (0.35%) on trades made via their ActiveTrader interface on desktop and, unlike any other exchange, they offer free withdrawals even for Ethereum. After buying you can then transfer the ETH out to a cold wallet like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io), which is the safest option to store it long term.\n\nSome tips: don't transfer your ETH all at once. First do a test transaction and make sure that it worked, then proceed to transfer the rest. Store the recovery phrase somewhere safe, never upload it online, on a pc or on a phone. It's meant to be stored on paper or on metal plates. DYOR about the security measures to take for this.\n\nThis is an incredible gift and you're an awesome aunt/uncle! Best wishes to you and your brother for this happy news.",

This mnemonic can generate as many public/private keypairs as you want, so as long as you keep the mnemonic safe, you can always regenerate the same private keys later even if you lose the keys.\n\nYou never ever ever want either your mnemonic or your private keys to exist on a computer that has been or will be connected to the internet (this is how they get stolen). As a result, you want to: \n\n**Generate the mnemonic offline:** A hardware wallet can do this for you. You initialize a new device and it will generate 24 word random mnemonic and display the words on the device - you can then write these down and store them in a safe place.\n\n**Safely store your private keys:** Your keys are stored on the hardware wallet. The hardware wallet is secured with a PIN, so even if I steal your hardware wallet, I still can't use your keys.\n\n**Sign transactions:** This is where the hardware wallets really shine. If I want to send crypto to someone, I need to sign a transaction using my keys. Instead of entering my private keys into my laptop (very bad), the transaction gets signed on the device and then the whole signed transaction is passed to the computer (via metamask for example). My private keys never touch the computer.\n\nIf you lose the hardware wallet or it breaks - doesn't matter. Get a new one and enter your 24 words and you're back in business.",

They as an institution are insured up to $750 million, your personal assets with them are not insured for that amount. So in the event that there is some catastrophic event that causes them to lose all of their (and by extension everyone else\u2019s) crypto, they would in theory be able to claim up to $750 mil on the policy. Of course that would probably be after years upon years of litigation with the underwriter, because there\u2019s no way in hell the insurance company is going to pay that out without a fight. \n\nKeep in mind that while crypto.com\u2019s AUM isn\u2019t public info, their daily trading volume is estimated to be around $750 mil, so it\u2019s likely they have several times that on hand. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s say they have double, $1.5 billion. If there was a theft event that saw the whole pot stolen, they would only be able to make an insurance claim for half, $750 million. And if, IF they got the full payout, you by extension would only be able to reclaim about half of what you lost with them. That is assuming you are actually entitled to anything at all. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were clauses in the TOS that excluded end users from being able to make claims on any insurance payouts made to crypto.com. \n\nTL;DR - These crypto exchange insurance policies are probably designed to protect the exchanges, not you. If they lose your money and get an insurance payout you will probably be told to kick rocks. They claim these policies are \u201cfor their users\u201d in press releases but unless you\u2019ve read the policy and all the associated fine print you don\u2019t know that for sure.",
