Imagine that 1/3 of a month when these clowns pull the funds out of the bank either same day or next.  They are definitley making money with floating these deposits so long.  No frk reason for this.  Gemini has up to 5 days.  From my experience it will clear from 3 to 5 days on Gemini.  Not this 9,10 or 14 day crap from Coinbase.  \n\nThese clowns have completely ruined thier debit card from doing this BS.  Imagine you go to the store and want to buy something.  Nope got to wait 1/3 of a month to purchase!",

I can do a debit card transfer up to $1,000 a week, buy BTC in a few seconds, and then send it out to my coinbase wallet where I can trade. I can then send it out of Coinbase. Zero holds. The only limit is that thousand a week which I think you can get that increased. I haven't had any holds for months.",

Understand wanting to use the card on the fly.\n\nIf you use a linked bank account as a payment method to deposit funds to your Coinbase cash wallet or to purchase cryptocurrency, these funds are immediately available for buying and selling on Coinbase. You can see when deposited funds will be available for withdrawal or spending prior to authorizing a purchase or deposit, as well as on the confirmation email for the transaction.\n\nIf you would like to change the funding method, go to the Pay tab, then select Coinbase Card > Paying with.\n - Choose Select asset, then choose the crypto that you\u2019d like to pay with.\n\nYou can automatically top-up your card by setting up recurring buys for the asset you choose to fund with as well.\n\nHope this helps Thad, many thanks!",
