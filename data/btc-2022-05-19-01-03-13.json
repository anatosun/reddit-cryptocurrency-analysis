            "selftext": "I did the bitcoin maxi AMA a few days ago.\n\nThis was my main doubt after a while.\n\nI just checked the chart of bch. I had never properly seen it before. Its below the price it was in July 2017. \n\n- What should be my incentive to hold it?\n- If there is no incentive, isnt it just better that I convert my dollars or bitcoin to BCH when I want to take advantage of this high tps or low fees. \n\nI get that this can change in the future. Like fees in bitcoin can become too high, etc. But right now, why should a person put the dollars that he earns at work to BCH, just to hold it. If he wants to buy something worth 20 dollars at a BCH accepting store due to some advantage, then he should just convert 20 dollars into BCH and use them. Why convert the rest of your dollars?\n\nThis happens in countries. People keep dollars in a safe at home, and only convert to their country's fiat if the want to pay for something in it.\n\nWhats the incentive to hold bitcoin cash? Usually any persons incentive to hold something is for price appreciation or some emotional attachment.\n\nWhat is the BCH community's to hold BCH right now?",

BCH is pretty much the only coin that is really gunning for real world adoption. Crypto without a real life purpose will all go to zero, even BTC. It is just a matter of time.\n\nThere are several projects launching this year, such as FileShop, that will use the BCH chain and heavily drive adoption and onchain usage.\n\nThe is smartBCH which is growing in value daily. The Verse token will be launching soon on the Verse Dex, and that whole ecosystem is ready to explode. FlexUSD is also now on smaetBCH.\n\nThere is also the small fact of an MP in St. Maarten accepting his whole salary in BCH, who is currently writing a law to make BCH a legal tender on the island. There will also be a BCH conference there on the 12/11/2022.\n\nSo loads of reasons to think that BCH price will go up, and fast. And once it does it generates a posiitve feedback loop, that helps further adoption and people will trust BCH more and not swap it out for BTC or a stablecoin.\n\nThen the price increases more, fuelling a very rapid agenda and adoption phase.\n\nAnd the great thing is, big blocks allow for that massive jump in adoption.\n\nSo bring it on BCH!",

If there is no incentive, isnt it just better that I convert my dollars or bitcoin to BCH when I want to take advantage of this high tps or low fees.\n\nBCH doesn't need an incentive to hold. In the short term, it's volatile, because it's a new asset, so the incentives are to convert it to a more stable asset when you're not using it. But the demand early on comes from its usefulness as a payment method. When the volatility declines enough for the average person compared to fiat, the incentive will be \"It doesn't go up and down that much, and I know I can always spend it when I want to.\"\n\nBCH enthusiasts may hold it and ride the ups and downs (I do, to some degree), but as long as it remains useful as money and volatility keeps going down (as the supply is more and more distributed), it will eventually be a store of value too. This is as opposed to BTC, which is NOT a store of value. So far it's been a good investment, but its short term volatility makes it a terrible store of value.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2mTypxJVL-g",

At least as I understand it, it's not a long/short term thing. It's a when the-owner-needs-to-spend-it thing, which could be during a \"bear market\" for their so-called store-of-value.\n\n>Just calculate cagr on the price for a long period of time. Thats usually any persons incentive to buy something right?\n\nRegardless of potential future price performance, people buy things for other reasons, like to use them because they need them or consider them their best option for a given use case.\n\nImagine if everyone in the world sending remittances were just buying BCH when they wanted to send it, and then the receivers were selling it for local currency when the received it. The users would be buying it because its the easiest, simplest option for their use case, and neither would be exposed to much volatility given the short time frames. But still this would provide constant demand for BCH.\n\nYou don't need HODLers if you have constant demand from users as an efficient payment method. If you manage to be an efficient payment method for long enough, the price may stabilize from widespread demand enough for people to start treating it as a store of value as well. (As oppsoed to something starting as a store of value, and then become used as money eventually.)",

Help educate them on crypto.  If they are really against it, simulate the experience by doing a 5% BCH buy on an exchange every week, so that you have some stash for your BCH spending (remember, joining an economy, and if you gotta start with one half you gotta start with one half then).  Continue to request it every couple of months, and as adoption spreads and confidence in crypto grows, their minds will change.  Or, like you say, if you truly believe in a crypto future, maybe you end up switching jobs for it (yes, extreme but it's an option if you truly are passionate about crypto).\n\nThe truth is, you have a job because you are valuable.  Employers aren't in the habit of unreasonably and persistently rejecting reasonable employee requests - they literally want to keep their employees happy so they stay at the company.

It is very low, but it is not 0. Even if the fee is 0.01$, maybe you'd still keep around 1-2$ in BCH after paying for your thing, right? Now scale that to 1b users.\nWith 1MB blocks such low fees wouldn't amount to much, but think of the potential, imagine filling 32MB blocks with real commerce, 256MB blocks, and so on...\n\nBCH is like a pre-revenue startup... you either see the potential, or you don't. Once everyone sees it, it will be priced in.\n\nBut here's the plan for the next stage... cash is always exchanged for something, right? It's only one part of the trade, and right now with BCH only the cash part can be trustlessly and permissionlessly exchanged on the blockchain. The other part is a good or a service, it must be delivered, too. What if those are digitized? What if instead of signing a car, you transfer a digital record  of car ownership and police recognizes such record as \"car papers\".

Lower price and stronger fundamentals means more upside potential.\n\nThe following are my personal incentives to hold Bitcoin Cash, they do not need to be incentives for everyone.\n\n1. My Bitcoin Cash wallet is my own bank account in my own bank. No one can freeze my account or prohibit certain my transactions for whatever excuse (like stupid AML of CTF). I literally have NO bank account with traditional banks. I simply do not need their \"services\".\n2. Bitcoin Cash has a limited number of coins. No one can print more than this amount, thereby depreciating them. That basically means than no John Smith (or whoever) from the central bank can get into my pocket and halve its contents simply by printing and carefully cutting the same amount of paper (or by just adding zeroes to his own account).  This also means that the real value of my coins is independent of the current price. This is why it makes sense to buy when the price is low and sell some when the price is relatively high.\n3. Bitcoin Cash has a relatively uniform distribution of coins among users, without much concentration of wealth in narrow circles of whales. [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin%20cash-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin%20cash-addresses.html) Compare this distribution to other coins. This means that it is not very likely that the price could collapse as a result of whales rushing to the exit.\n4. Bitcoin Cash allow everyone to perform quick transactions for a fraction of a penny. For holders this means very high potential for adoption as electronic cash, independent of governments and central banks, especially in these days when invasion of privacy, censorship, inflation and control over the population in general run rampant. And Bitcoin Cash is already adopted as electronic cash like no other coin. And the higher the adoption the higher the price.\n5. Bitcoin Cash price has high volatility. Yes, the combination of strong fundamentals and high volatility (precisely this combination, not just one thing or the other) is a big plus for me. It allows to make money by simply rebalancing a portfolio of some percentage (lets's say 50%) of dollars and some percentage of BCH. Instead of dollars or stablecoins I use short positions in perpetual futures, and keep most of my BCH in my non-custodial wallet. To rebalance my portfolio I just place limit orders in advance to buy or sell at calculated priced for calculated amounts. And they are executed automatically and with very low fees (perpetual futures generally have lower fees than spot). This way I not only reduce the volatility of the BCH price for me, but also make some money out of this volatility.\n\nHere I just outlined some of the incentives for me to hold BCH. And there are even more incentives to use BCH, but this is another topic.",

Thats not adoption, thats just the store accepting an alternative payment option. You still pay dollars but through bch.\n\nPeople arent taking loans in bch, and people arent lending out their bch.\n\nThats not an economy or any kind of adoption.\n\nI agree bitcoin doesnt have any adoption either, but atleast it goes up in price and miners constantly add more hashrate.

First you have to earn people's trust that it works and has advantages over other methods of payment. Even Apple pay and Google pay haven't made mass adoption, and all they are is a an extension of your debit/credit card.",
