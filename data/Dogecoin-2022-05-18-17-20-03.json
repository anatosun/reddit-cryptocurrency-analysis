            "selftext": "CoinQuora talked about Tesla and SpaceX CEO, Elon Musk, affirming an already said statement of his regarding DogeCoin, where he said that the coin \u201chas potential as a currency\u201d.\n\n The statement came first in a tweet from the creator of DogeCoin, Billy Markus, yet Musk reaffirmed this statement as he guested on the All-In Summit.  The tweet started with Markus saying \u201cthe reason I like DogeCoin is because it knows it is stupid,\u201d Musk replied saying \u201cit has potential as a currency.\u201d But looking at the project it's potential is simply the effect of Musk unlike with projects like Hyve solving the current problems in the global freelance and workforce market, BobEco creating thousands of jobs through the fight against pollution and Aventus, a scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions.\n\n  However, on May 16, another tweet was shared by Dr. \nJulian Hosp, the CEO of CakeDeFi. The tweet said that Musk talked about the possibility of integrating DogeCoin with a social media app to create \u201cWechat-like super app.\u201d  In other news, Musk announced that his plans to buy Twitter, the social network, were put off until Twitter\u2019s CEO comes forward with real numbers of the fake, spam, or bot accounts, this happened after the CEO refused to show proof of their claims which state that only 5% of their users are fake/scam accounts. \n\n\n Could Twitter be the social network that musk integrates Dogecoin to? Would this skyrocket its potential even more?  Let's watch and see.",

Technically speaking, no cryptocurrency is useful for day to day use because of this\n\nThat being said, I used to use dogecoin as the \"fiat\" currency back when the price was $0.003 as the spread was much lower than using GBP when exchanging from one crypto to another. In order for me to do the same thing again, dogecoin needs to stay at a consistent price, or fluctuate minimally\n\n> What\u2019s the point of constantly making new wallets when you can just stick the same bank account\n\nIf I want someone to send me crypto, there's 1 single button to generate a QR code for me to receive. The wallet does everything else for me. I get a new wallet address to keep some anonymity, I get the money in seconds, and the person sending it only needs to scan a QR code\n\nThat's easier than my bank account requesting a person's account number and sort code, or having to write an entire IBAN by hand, or sending money on the weekend and waiting for it to arrive Monday morning. All of these options from my bank are immediately identifiable and I have no say on that matter\n\n> Why would the masses like to switch to a public format?\n\nIt's not public, it's pseudonymous, which is more than what the public have already\n\n> The point of credit cards are to either build credit or to borrow capital that one does not have\n\nDogecoin is debit only. If you want credit, remain with a bank\n\n> It\u2019s not accessible to the public unlike the blockchain\n\nThe entire point of a publicly accessible blockchain is to ensure that money doesn't appear out of nowhere, like how banks literally make money out of nowhere by creating loans for clients. The concept is that no single institution can be trusted, so every transaction must be validated by the community\n\nYou cannot have a subprime lending crisis with dogecoin because you cannot make loans with money that came from nowhere. You cannot have rising inflation with dogecoin because it's a fixed amount of minted coins per year. But you can have it all and more with traditional banking",

I use a credit with no fees. I pay my credit card on time and improve credit score. My brother pays a 50$ fee a year to use his credit card which he doesn\u2019t mine since it improves his credit.\nAlso, my bank/credit statement is between me and my bank.

This would be more like an electronic cash payment system over a credit card system.\n\nAs for fees, every credit card/Debit card transaction is subject to their processing fees.  The fees are paid by the merchant though.  Some credit card companies kick a portion of that back to the card holders as \"cash back\".  However, you are paying for credit card fees indirectly as mechants have to increase the price to cover the fees.  There was a post a while back that did the math and showed that  Walmart could save millions a day by using crypto over credit cards as a means for electronic payments.   We can only hope that if they do Dogecoin becomes one that they do accept!",

I find it more likely that he's looking for ways to sell Tesla stock while it's high and stash the money somewhere else\n\nMaybe he'd use Tesla stocks to buy twitter, say that it's a bad deal and withdraw the money tax free, or place it into dogecoin and force a pump to new highs. Yes, we would benefit from a pump, but it will most certainly cause a dump back down, and there will always be someone left holding the bag. That's no bueno\n\nThe WeChat idea is a really good idea for the following reason: There is no western equivalent to WeChat for payments. Cashapp exists but is still small. PayPal isn't used as a regular app and isn't a social media platform. Whatsapp has been trying to get this running for at least a year and has been failing (especially with the stuff they tried doing in India). Facebook/Meta failed with their Diem coin. If Elon is actually going to do this then he needs to do it quick and do it right the first time before someone beats him to the punch\n\nEdit: For those who downvoted, think of the reasons why Billy and the developers for dogecoin aren't taking a commanding, figurehead role. Musk hasn't added anything that dogecoin doesn't already have. The only thing he provides is capital, and that capital hasn't shown any realistic change to dogecoin's development. I am pro dogecoin but distrustful of Elon Musk",
