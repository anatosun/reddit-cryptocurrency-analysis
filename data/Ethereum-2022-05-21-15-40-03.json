I just read this blog post by Vitalik ([https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/04/01/maximalist.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/04/01/maximalist.html)). \n\nI would encourage anyone who hasn\u2019t yet read it to check it out.\n\nIt's a thought-provoking defence on the courage required for being a maximalist (specifically a Bitcoin maxi).\n\nIn his post, Vitalik writes, \" Network effects really are logarithmic, not quadratic: once a cryptocurrency is \"big enough\", it has enough liquidity to function, and multi-cryptocurrency payment processors will easily add it to their collection.\"\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1- What does it mean for something to be logarithmic? \n\n2- What is the difference if something is logarithmic vs exponential?\n\nThanks for your help.",

It's miles away from the critiques of maximalism. \n\nAnd that is the actual joke.\n\nBut the seriousness behind it is relevant. \n\nFor instance, is he defending the zero-sum game mindset of maximalists? No. \n\nIs he defending the concept of spreading misinformation about other tokens? No. \n\nIs he defending the concept of supporting bans of others tokens? No. \n\nWhat he is seriously defending isn't the concept of maximalism that is denounced here and there. That's why it's an April's fool to begin with, because you should replace the word maximalism with the actual concept he's talking about. Call it maximalism if you want, but then don't confuse it with what's being receiving critiques and being mocked about some crypto fools.\n\nMaybe it's just his humour being misinterpreted. Or maybe some people are fooled by their own cognitive bias, which would explain why its best place is as a writing of the first of April.",
