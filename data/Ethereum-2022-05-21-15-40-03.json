I just read this blog post by Vitalik ([https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/04/01/maximalist.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/04/01/maximalist.html)). \n\nI would encourage anyone who hasn\u2019t yet read it to check it out.\n\nIt's a thought-provoking defence on the courage required for being a maximalist (specifically a Bitcoin maxi).\n\nIn his post, Vitalik writes, \" Network effects really are logarithmic, not quadratic: once a cryptocurrency is \"big enough\", it has enough liquidity to function, and multi-cryptocurrency payment processors will easily add it to their collection.\"\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1- What does it mean for something to be logarithmic? \n\n2- What is the difference if something is logarithmic vs exponential?\n\nThanks for your help.",
