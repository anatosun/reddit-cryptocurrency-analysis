I have my bank account and credit card linked so instant buys always used to go right through.   Is this because of the holiday?   I purchased just using my bank account and it's on hold for 10 days....that's pretty excessive \n\nWhat gives Coinbase??\n\nWhat's that? Ohhh....I hear other exchanges calling my name.",

We have some steps that can help fix issues like this both on app or over pc here:\nhttps://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/other-topics/troubleshooting-and-tips/app-troubleshooting \n\nTrading on Coinbase is instant but no withdrawals are available until your bank has processed the deposit.  That timeframe can vary depending on your bank, and some other methods like debit can be instant without a hold.  You will find that hold length on the confirmation window of your purchase.  More here on that:\nhttps://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/sending-or-receiving-cryptocurrency/why-is-my-cryptocurrency-withdrawal-delayed\n\nHopefully, this will get everything all fixed up for you.",
