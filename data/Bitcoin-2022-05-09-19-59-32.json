What you store on your computer/wallet are the **keys** to unlock those Bitcoin. \n\nWhoever has the keys, can unlock those Bitcoin. \n\nWhy is this distinction important? The fact that your wallet shows your balance and lets you spend it, doesn't mean someone else can't. If they have the keys, they can. \n\nAnd this is why a hardware wallet is important. These devices generate the keys offline, without any internet-connected device knowing about those keys. So they cannot leak.\n\nAnd you write the seeds down in paper (or steel), NOT your computer (otherwise, there is no point in using a hardware wallet).",
