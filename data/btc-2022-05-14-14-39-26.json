With PoW miners are committed because in order to get a ROI they HAVE to mine and they HAVE to sell their hardware. And having a market for sha-256 hashes is a matter of survival for them. They don't really favor a particular coin: as long as it is successful in attaining a market cap and has the sha-256 PoW algo, it will bring revenue. It doesn't pay to play favorites. It's anonymous and decentralized by design, you don't need a permission from existing hardware owners to join the game, and nobody can really tell who's playing the game.",

A mempool is a place where the miners keep unconfirmed transactions until they solve the \"Math problem\" to mine a block, then they could include the unconfirmed transactions into the block. BTC's block is a tiny 1MB size block so it fits less transaction, resulting in congestion and unconfirmed transactions and high fees. Bitcoin Cash's huge blocksize means that there is no congestion and always low fees, which works for global peer to peer money.",

I think the cryptos with real use cases will be all that exists within 10 years.\n\nAt these prices, even if not a BCH fan, I think it's not too crazy to stock up on 1 or 2 coins for the wallet for when BCH finally finds its feet.

This is how Bitcoin corrections work too: the market slows down, people avoid talking about BTC, and right when no one is looking, Bitcoin corrects itself. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn\u2019t, but now whatever potential there was happening, now is gone. \nLooking at the Brightside, Bitcoin liquidations were low this time. People were cautious and avoiding going long, just in case something happened, and something did. Caution pays off.  On weekly timeframes, BTC/USD was near to completing its sixth consecutive red weekly candle \u2014 something which had only occurred once before in its history back in 2014.\n\nJust goes to show, that we must not be too hopeful. Of course, on the long-term, one should not be worried, but on the short-term, yeah, you should. The Luna catastrophe is going to make a lot of people question every currency out there, and Bitcoin will be one to go one the stand as well, you better be ready to hold. \nIn the meantime, all you have to do, is hold. Avoid the doom posts of social media, they just want you to sell early, and manage your own risk accordingly. Avoid cashing out, and stick to using cryptocurrency for pretty much everything, even regular things. There are now platforms like Binance pay that allow you to pay (without fees) with crypto or even places like exeno that allow you to buy and sell things with cryptocurrency at any time you choose. Try to avoid cash and use those places instead. \nThings will surely recover, but not for a while now. Whatever chance there was in recovery, rest assured, it\u2019s well beyond and gone now. You have to have patience, lest you risk losing value this early on.",

Everyone knows USDT has little to no backing, so if it loses its peg, Tether won't just dump BTC on the market making it crash harder.  Instead, they'll just print more tether and the USDT value will continue to sink.  In the mean time all the money exiting USDT will go into alts, thus raising them.\n\nIt seems to me like it could be a win/win/win where Tether collapses, Citadel gets liquidated on their crypto shorts, and the crypto market rebounds.

This is because a coordinated attacker has already planned for it and is shorting BTC and/or their other assets.\n\n2: If they just print more USDT to maintain the peg without selling off assets, they have a chance of surviving this while pumping the crypto market and also causing Citadel/Blackrock/etc to take heavily losses on their loans and shorts.\n\n3: If they just print more USDT without selling off assets, the market itself will raise up, but USDT could fail and they could also take Citadel with them.

It is ugly in the regulated markets, so should be no surprise they bully retail even more in the crypto markets.\n\n[https://youtu.be/\\_0rcW8joA60](https://youtu.be/_0rcW8joA60)\n\nGerry Gensler himself had to admit that 90-95% of retail orders no longer hit lit exchanges.

These people, like yourself Jeremy, are critical to the survival of BCH.\n\nBut BCH wants to do much more than survive, it wants and needs to grow. And this is something where there is room for improvement.\n\nI am making as much social media noise about Sunny, Marc, Jason's or Ryan's adoption in St. Kitts, St. Maarten, North Queensland and Florida respectively, as possible.\n \nOthers are doing this too, but there could be many more. Let's help cheer lead the great work by our development teams and adoption teams to help inspire them and new people into the eco system, to invest, to build, and be part of this amazing movement.\n\nWe all need to be a part of this, and not just stay in safe haunts preaching to the converted about how BCH is awesome. \n\nIt is awesome. We already know that.\nIt is time for the rest of the world to know this \ud83d\udc4d",

In addition, some minor UI flow issues with the LNS UI were addressed.  Also, perhaps most importantly, the `web3` python package has been made **optional**.  Users not interested in LNS Names need not install this package and the app will continue to run as before.  This, in particular, is important for package maintainers for e.g. Fedora and other distros which do not offer the `python-web3` package, so that they can continue to offer `electron-cash` as a distro-level package (even if the `python-web3` package is missing from the distro).\n\n# What's New in 4.2.9\n\n- LNS: Fix crash in multiple_result_picker (cculianu)\n- LNS: Make the web3 dependencies optional #2441. This allows distro packages to not have to pull them in to provide electron-cash. (cculianu)\n- LNS: Fix to the \"add to contacts\" button + misc code nits (cculianu)\n- Qt: Disable destroyed_print_error unless a static flag is set. This fixes some of the crash issues seen on Windows. (cculianu)\n- LNS: Bugfix whereby GUI was being sometimes access from a thread. This fixes the remaining portion (hopefully) of the crash issues seen on Windows. (cculianu)\n- LNS: Misc fixups and code cleanup (cculianu)\n\n---\n\n## Download Notes\n\n- **`.AppImage`** is for any **Linux 64 bit** (it's a self-contained app bundle with everything inside) \n  - **Note**: Be sure to set this to executable to run it (`chmod +x`)\n- **`.dmg`** is for **macOS** (Mojave or above is required otherwise it may not run)\n- **`.exe`** is for **Windows**\n- **Srcdist** is provided as **`.tar.gz`** and/or **`.zip`** files \n  - Includes Python dependencies inside in `packages/`\n  - This is built on a **Linux 64-bit** system, and also includes `libsecp256k1.so.0` and the embedded `tor` static binary.\n- **ShaSums and Signatures:** Sha256 hashes and pgp signatures for the below release [are available here](https://github.com/Electron-Cash/keys-n-hashes/tree/master/sigs-and-sums).",

            "selftext": "Just saw that the Badger Wallet will no longer be supported (presumably due to the BCash client not keeping up with the upcoming network upgrade). We at Bitcoin Bay had developed a fork of the Badger Wallet, loosely named OPTN, replacing BitBox-SDK with Permissionless Software Foundation's BCH-JS library. BCH-JS defaults to connecting with a Fullstack.cash BCHN full node (I believe it should be compatible with the BU client as well). \n\nWe have an early release of the CashScript integration we had been working prior to COVID which people can find and download from our GitHub page - https://github.com/BitcoinBay/OPTN-Wallet/releases\n\nThe CashScript integration is still just in demo phase, so it is not guaranteed to send properly. But regular features, like SLP tokens, should still function as expected. Indexing for the SLP tokens will take a bit of time as it is still using the legacy SLPDB indexer.\n\nWe at Bitcoin Bay had started with a rewrite of the Badger wallet due to a lot of outdated infrastructure popping up during development. Some may recall we tried doing a Flipstarter campaign a few months back on OPTN, which unfortunately didn't get much traction, and thus we decided to put the rewrite effort on the back burner for the time being. For reference, here's the repo for our rewrite efforts https://github.com/BitcoinBay/rewriteOptn\n\nWe still have plans to support the wallet moving forward, the main challenge is securing enough funding to hire a small dedicated team of developers (2~4 people) for the wallet. We're also exploring a seed-round investment to jumpstart the development, so if enough people are interested in seeing the Badger Wallet be maintained moving forward, it would help with the pitch to potential investors.",

Since our earlier attempt a few months prior at a flipstarter campaign, we're focusing more on the traditional route of raising funds for startups. Of course, open source development means anyone could potentially contribute, but with the scope of developing and maintaining the wallet, you really need some form of a dedicated team working on it.",

I would really like BCH entrepreneurs to start thinking more about how to be profitable or self sustainable in order to attract investors. When you're profitable or minimum self sustainable, you're no longer in a vulnerable position needing investors and that's the ideal position to be at. In fact, that kind of position is much more attractive to investors. Of course, there will be things that will not be profitable no matter how hard you try (I think! eg. full nodes) and that's understandable.",

Check out the specs, for example, [here](https://upgradespecs.bitcoincashnode.org/2022-05-15-upgrade/) (as usual there is no one *official* source, I pasted the one that I had handy). \n\nThe fork/upgrade will happen when the first transaction that is incompatible with the old rules will be mined. And guess what, you can be part of this history, if you are so inclined. \n\n---\n\nu/bitcoincashautist has created an UTXO that is spendable only by using the new features. It's actually really clever, because with it, you can make history *while also* getting BCH for it. Do check out the details [in his recent thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/un6l6b/celebrating_bitcoin_cash_may2022_upgrade_2_bch/). The clock is ticking so hurry up!\n\n---\n\nIf you're not into riddles, and making history is a reward in itself, you can just propagate your own forking transaction, you can do so with this [script by Mr Culianu](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/1537/diffs). Don't be intimidated, most of it is just boilerplate to avoid dependecies. This lets you wait for the right time to propagate a transaction, so that you don't need to do it manually. As written in the documentation, the usage is `poll_broadcast_txn.py <host> <port> <rpcuser> <rpcpass> <mtptarget> <txnhex> [sleeptime]`. Very conveniently, Mr Culianu has already set up a P2SH UTXO for this, and you can actually use the following to fork: \n\n`./poll_broadcast_txn.py localhost 8332 MyRPCUserName MyRPCPassword 1652616000 0200000001f3aaf89275c451ba0668a34dcbdb759a657ad2a2eee35fbee41d9fd825ebaf16000000007a10476f20424348212059617921010203044c677400a06375687400a06375687400a06375687400a06375687400a06375687400a06375687400a06375687400a06375680400000001040000000295070000000000000288c35188c4518800cd1976a9147ee7b62fa98a985c5553ff66120a91b8189f658188ac87ffffffff0119030000000000001976a9147ee7b62fa98a985c5553ff66120a91b8189f658188ac00000000`\n\nRequirements: an up to date bitcoind, python. \n\n---\n\nActually, you can do both, and solve u/bitcoincashautist's challenge beforehand, and plug the solution into Mr Culianu's script, and have it execute at the fork second. How awesome is that?\n\nAnyway, Happy Fork Day!",

I have a way of thinking how we may promote the technical upgrades in the future.\n\nIn my opinion, most people are non-technical and lack the ability to understand why these big integers or native introspection matter. They sound like another technical word to them and so they don't connect with it. And if they are unable to see how it is beneficial to them, they are less likely to invest in the coin.\n\nMy opinion is that we might want to start thinking about the marketing approach where we emphasize the potential outcomes of the upgrades rather than the technical outcomes. This computer has 16gb ram doesn't sound as exciting as you can finally play the video games you love without lag and at ultra high definition. This iPhone has xefi 4d technology doesn't sound as exciting as you can see and speak to your family as if they are right beside you.\n\nIt also helps to make it easy for journalists to write about BCH if they understand things more easily.",

However nobody really knows how many reserves they have, if those are in crypto or in cash or in whatever.\n\nThey are a black box. \n\nThis 5 billion, is it them pretending to cashing out a whale?\n\nAre THEY cashing out themselves?\n\nDid they really just redeem 5 billion Tether for 5 billion dollars?\n\nNobody knows ... well somebody does ... but it's not me or you. \n\nWe all know that one day Tether will die.\n\nIt's very possible that it will happen now.\n\nRight now after these massive crashes, everybody is expecting a recovery.\n\nBut if the fed announces they are touching interest rates again or if Europe and the USA come out with strict regulation on stablecoins.\n\nThis might spook the stablecoin system. When there is panic amongst the whales, the entire cryptocurrency system will follow luna in absolutely no time.\n\nIt will be unlike anything the world has ever seen. \n\nThis is the best thing ever for P2P cash cause it will be the great reset after which everybody loses almost everything.\n\nAnd BCH can start over from basically zero, trying to find adoption. \n\nBut in the process the price of BCH will dip and dip and dip and dip and dip.\n\nIf there are cryptocurrencies that survives such a reset it will be only three. Ethereum, monero and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nSure, Bitcoin will look to the be the first recovering. But then people will be like: wait a minute, this stuff has no utility why does it have value?\n\nThe world post Tether will be radically different.\n\nOne way of looking at the insane increase of stablecoins the last 2 years is the following.\n\nIf you believe the prices of cryptocurrencies will go up, you don't put your money in stablecoins.\n\nSo that means the more stable coins there are and the more money in those stablecoins the more people bet on the prices of crypto going down, not up. \n\nBUSD, USDC, DAI .... they should survive.\n\nAnd once Tether is gone, the system will be much fairer for Ethereum, monero and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nIf this reset happens it's pretty much a given that Ethereum will overtake Bitcoin in marketcap, because of it's utility. \n\nBecause of all the stablecoins and tokens on Ethereum it's more economic resilient then Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin only has one thing going for it. The high price and the believe that the price will go even higher.\n\nSomething happens to Tether that causes the right amount of panic and that Bitcoin believe melts like snow when the sun comes up.\n\nAnd then Bitcoin has nothing left. \n\nI could see all of this play out in just 3 weeks. \n\nLuna went to zero in 3 days. 99,9% of crypto could go to zero in just 3 weeks. \n\nAnd even if you would short, you would most likely still lose because of how Tether has infected every single part of the ecosystem.\n\nLuna went down in just 3 days. The moon went blood red. Maybe it's a sign. And everybody is incredibly nervous right now, and this makes for the perfect possible panic.",
