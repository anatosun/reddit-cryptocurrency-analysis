So it\u2019s still profitable. \n\nOver time as the reward gets lower, the miners transition to being more reliant on transaction fees. \n\nIf miners go offline (because it\u2019s not profitable) then the network difficulty automatically lowers, enticing miners back. So an equilibrium is always found.",
