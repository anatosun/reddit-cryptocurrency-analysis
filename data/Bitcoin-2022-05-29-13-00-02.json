Buddy and I found a wallet with 250 coins on it and he gave me 69. \n\nTransfer it to cold storage, and, cash out what you need at exchanges. Yes i said plural. Exchanges only let you take out $500,000 per month. You need to do all of the KYC on these things. It is worth using multiple exchanges so you have freedom and flexibility. \n\nI would recommend keeping all of the coins on cold storage and moving coins that you *need* to cash out to exchanges. I recommend Coinbase Pro and Kraken because they allow you to easily make limit orders. I always keep 2 coins on each exchange ready to sell at way higher than what is currently trading, so that they automatically sell at that price.\n\nCongratulations.\n\nEDIT: Also HIRE A FINANCIAL ADVISOR!",
