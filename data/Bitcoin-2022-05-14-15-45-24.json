With Bitcoin price dropping, hodlers continue to eat up only a bigger percentage of an asset that has a finite supply. It is similar to a company repurchasing its shares at discount prices. Holders buying now, during a crash, acquire triple the amount of btc than during the all time high period. Once put away in cold storage, it s off the market.   \n\nIf btc-price drops, more Bitcoin gets bought up for an equal amount of fiat money. That same money is being printed every day, so fiat supply is unlimited.   Don\u2019t let a sell-off scare you; the fundamental reasons why you\u2019re in Bitcoin are still intact.",

The best thing you can do is average down and buy more stocks or more coins you\u2019re only at a loss if you sell and this is what they want. Put your money in but don\u2019t buy until it hit a lower price or just buy little by little $25 at a time for a coin it\u2019ll all average it self out and the market will eventually correct it\u2019s self. When you panic sell you\u2019re the one becoming poorer do what the rich do hold and sell at the top don\u2019t sell at the bottom. You\u2019re losing your hard earned dollars and that\u2019s what they want. This is the perfect opportunity to buy right now and get in. Go for a run work out do something beside obsess over your losses. If you can\u2019t stomach it you shouldn\u2019t be in the market. This is what investing is about holding when you don\u2019t want too cause the price is down. I know many people who are at retirement age and they\u2019re just going to leave their money alone until it recovers and it always recovers. Just buy more little by little you\u2019ll thank me later and everyone else who has said the same thing.",

But it's the network that  makes bitcoin truly valuable.  The bitcoin network is the most secure, decentralized, and global asset in the world.   Thats been running almost flawlessly with very minimal downtime since its existence.  As long as this is the case, El Salvador can not loose.  And by the way the USD is also still legal tender in El Salvador, so people are able to exchange bitcoin for USD for quick and  easy and free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBitcoin is much bigger than just the price.  People need to start understanding this.  Dive into the actual network it will blow your mind and you will realize that the price means very very little. Bitcoins security is top notch, it can not be changed, more coins can never be added, AND IT LITERALLY CAN NOT BE MANIPULATED\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlus your arguments dont make any sense.  The fact that you used the word \"tokens\" to describe bitcoin tells me you dont know shit.  Its a trillion dollar asset, that's not easy to manipulate.  That time has passed for anyone to even think of doing this.  But by your logic if they buy that much bitcoin it has no choice but to increase in value. Thats the beauty with bitcoins de-inflationary monetary system.  And \"dumping\" them on the market wont affect the price as much as you think.  There will always be buyers (retail, companies, countries, institutions). People aren't just gonna \"stop believing in bitcoin\" because the price goes down.  That's just another tuesday for bitcoin bud, try another way to spread your FUD",

It\u2019s a fixed rate bond paying 7.75%.  It is due on 1/24/2023.  You can see all the details here\u2026\n\nhttps://www.bourse.lu/security/USP01012AJ55/62269\n\nNote, none of this debt is owned by the IMF\n\nThe way bonds like this work (and most countries do it this way including the US) is that the issuer (El Salvador) pays out half of that 7.75% twice a year.  If you do the math you\u2019ll see that comes out to $31M every 6 months.  Then at the end of the term (Jan 24th 2023) they have to give the holders of the bond the original amount back ($800M total).  That fixed $31M payment every six months amount was agreed in 2002, it\u2019s not a new thing.\n\nIn the last year, El Salvador has bought 2300 bitcoins for roughly $100M.  2300 coins are now worth about $67M meaning they\u2019ve lost $33M.  So when people say they\u2019ve lost the equivalent of one debt payment, they mean they could have made one of those 6 month payments with the $33M they are currently down.\n\nWhen people talk about a default, they mean that El Salvador can\u2019t pay it\u2019s obligations on this debt.  Nobody is really worried about ES making that next $31M payment.  What they are worried about is that $800M repayment in January.\n\nThe reason a default is a big deal, is nobody is going to lend you money ever again if you have a history of not paying it back.  Or if they do, they are going to charge you crazy high interest.\n\nGiven El Salvador needs to borrow money to keep paying it\u2019s bills (interest on it\u2019s other debts, state pensions, paying the army etc etc), a default would be a disaster.\n\nThat\u2019s where the IMF could step in.  They could lend them the $800M at a below market interest rate.  But they will add strings, and one of those strings will likely be, stop doing risky speculative things and start doing the basics right.",

The stock market was artificially inflated due to corporate buybacks using payroll protection program money and prior to that it was bailout money to some companies.\n\nThen borrowing money with almost no interest so now with the interest rate going up less will spend and it\u2019s speculators keeping the scam going. \n\nNot making it political at all. Under previous administration, it was mandated ALL money for PPP was to go to actual payroll and the said head of that administration warned of consequences if that money was not to keep people employed. Many companies took the money and laid off people for fat pay days and increase profits. Then when the current administration took over they changed it to where the PPP could (up to a set percent) be used for anything, not just payroll. So that\u2019s when we saw a spike in share buybacks. I work for a bank and had to make the material for clients/sales team and that\u2019s where I found out about the change. I was floored. People laid off while your tax dollars went to share buybacks to enrich the 1%, the executives. \n\nWe should be in a depression, interest rates are only showing a small fraction of what should actually be. So my guess is day traders saw this, saw BTC skyrocket & are in both stocks and crypto. I see stops getting taken out as mad selloff a hit as speculators know companies will not show increased profits quarter over quarter. I think BTC sell offs were to both short it for profits and to pay off their debts owed trading options and shit.\n\nMostly my guess. In short? No\u2026I don\u2019t think it\u2019s IMF. I think the fraud that is the current global economic system is simply revealing and YOU the consumer will be blamed and like in 2008, nobody will go to jail. Sadly greasy day traders got in and like a parasite, grabbed onto crypto and we now move with the stock market hoping to break free.",
