The best thing you can do is average down and buy more stocks or more coins you\u2019re only at a loss if you sell and this is what they want. Put your money in but don\u2019t buy until it hit a lower price or just buy little by little $25 at a time for a coin it\u2019ll all average it self out and the market will eventually correct it\u2019s self. When you panic sell you\u2019re the one becoming poorer do what the rich do hold and sell at the top don\u2019t sell at the bottom. You\u2019re losing your hard earned dollars and that\u2019s what they want. This is the perfect opportunity to buy right now and get in. Go for a run work out do something beside obsess over your losses. If you can\u2019t stomach it you shouldn\u2019t be in the market. This is what investing is about holding when you don\u2019t want too cause the price is down. I know many people who are at retirement age and they\u2019re just going to leave their money alone until it recovers and it always recovers. Just buy more little by little you\u2019ll thank me later and everyone else who has said the same thing.",
