Previously I have seen people state that if Bitcoin was restricted to having, apart from coinbase transactions, only transactions with a single input, that this could not work. Why is this?\n2. How did Bitcoin make itself available so that other people can connect their own nodes to it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!",

In the height of the bull market, the masses assumed that BTC would go much much higher. \n\nIn every BTC bull run so far, the masses have been totally unable to predict a top. \n\nWhy do you think that is? \n\nFor me it was simple. I knew the bull market was over when billionaires started tweeting, and rappers started rapping about crypto. \n\nThat being said, the same people who were wrong about the top, are now predicting a bottom around the 20k range. \n\nThe masses also predicted a bottom in the 10k range during the last bear market. \n\nSince the masses are always wrong in predicting tops and bottoms, AND the masses believe we will never see BTC less than 10k again, I\u2019m preparing for the masses to be wrong, again. \n\nSo, I won\u2019t shop based on price. At all. I\u2019ll begin buying when the masses give up.  Much easier to wait to witness people throwing in the white towel vs trying to predict prices. \n\nYou?",
