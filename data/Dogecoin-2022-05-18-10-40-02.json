I\u2019m certainly not saying it can\u2019t recover but the way the market is currently heading we are on the cusp of a recession and that means less of a chance for DOGE to recover for years - if someone is struggling the can\u2019t risk on crypto, can\u2019t pay a mortgage or rent in crypto. When the market was red hot taking those gains into crypto was a no brainer now it\u2019s \u201chodlers\u201d and people waiting to see what happens\n\nAgain, just want to get the message out there that everyone\u2019s circumstances are different and just cause something may go up again, I\u2019d the time value on that is years out then it may be more beneficial to just ensure you have some savings in place for emergencies.",
