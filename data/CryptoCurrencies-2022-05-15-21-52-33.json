So basically, I could pay for something in real-life (e.g. catering) through a crypto transfer or sending the crypto to my wallet, exchanging to fiat, sending it to my bank account and paying for the costs. However, most businesses don't have a cryptocurrency wallet yet and the latter defeats the purpose of DAOs where everything is democritized and there is no hierarchy in groups.\n\nSo my question is, is there a way to make real-life payments through a DAO while ensuring decentralization and transparency?\n\nMy knowledge about DAOs is not very extensive so I'm sorry for my ignorance.\n\nThanks in advance.",

The amount they've achieved in such a short time and how incredible their team is, is world's beyond pretty much every other crypto I've ever been apart of. That's why when they released their staking options up to 36 months I didn't hesitate for a second to lock mine up. The average lock period is mid 20s too for months and 57% of the supply is locked.

I called out the project nearly a year ago to this day that people shouldn't invest into it, you can see my thread on the link below. \n\n[https://twitter.com/DizzleCrypto/status/1384878830268125186](https://twitter.com/DizzleCrypto/status/1384878830268125186)\n\nI also find it funny how people are trying to defend this project as well, if you've not seen the video, the link is below. It's been up for less than two days and it's already got over 600k views. On top of that there will be a second part with the former CTO of Safemoon. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzbBi0agLNg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzbBi0agLNg)",

And most of that time has been spent between mid 30k and low 50k tracking the swings of the stock market. \n\nWill people finally admit that institutional adoption has destroyed bitcoin and any chance of ever actually doing anything substantial again? \n\nOr is there another reason for bitcoin being a piece of shit that just goes sideways for years on end despite massive inflation? \n\nI think the best thing going forward is for BTC to slowly fade away and get out of the way so other crypto currencies can get out of its shadow and be able to to be measured and perform based on their own merits.",

He might not have realized through that bitcoin was sold at a discount to the Canadian dollar since there wasn\u2019t much demand.

You see, most people who have been in crypto for any time understand what\u2019s a scam and can see it from miles away, but they choose to avoid them. All is right and fair and they did as they should, but there should also be a responsibility on them, yes that includes me and you, to WARN others about projects we are skeptical about. \n\nObviously, there\u2019s no 100% certain way wherein someone could see if a project is legitimate or scam, and that could always happen. Which is why many projects have taken insurance measures like the one crypto dot com initiated (which insures the company not the investors actually) or the insurance fund that sol prime started (which actually insures the investors). But there are always reads we can make on the market, and it falls within our hands to guide others not just into good projects, but also away from mal intentions.",

The firms announced a partnership in 2021. G2 alleges that Bondly misled the club about its NFT production capabilities and did not meet its deadlines. \n\nWhen popular competitive gaming club G2 Esports announced its plans to\u00a0launch Solana-based NFTs\u00a0in January, there was a curious question mark hanging over the news: What happened to G2\u2019s\u00a0NFT\u00a0deal with Bondly, which was\u00a0announced in June 2021, well apparently they never came into fruition. \n\nThis news is a concern since blockchains can recover from but it could pause a PR nightmare for them if investors possibly get caught in the aftermath of if, Solana has been implementing more safety measures like an insurance fund on their recent IDO incubator SoIana prime to protect investors since they're aiming to list new NFT startups and IDOs. \n\nG2 Esports filed suit against Bondly in Los Angeles County Superior Court on March 16, according to a report from\u00a0The Washington Post. Per the report, the filing alleges that Bondly leadership misled G2 about its ability to create NFT collectibles via the partnership and failed to deliver on set deadlines. \n\nThe esports team alleges $5.25 million in total damages resulting from the deal, which was a two-year exclusive agreement signed on June 2, 2021. According to contracts filed with the court, per the report, Bondly was supposed to pay a $2 million annual licensing fee to G2 Esports, as well as a guaranteed advance of $1.25 million.",

It\u2019s a waste of time.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about legislation regarding crypto take a step back and reevaluate why you decided to buy crypto. Cryptocurrencies are censorship resistant. If it\u2019s not censorship resistant then it\u2019s anything but a cryptocurrency(probably a scam). Governments can put all the laws down they want and outright ban crypto, but it doesn\u2019t matter everyone can still use the blockchain. \n\nNow if you invested lots of money into a centralized shitcoin that is easily censored you should be worried, but that was your mistake on buying a shitty project. Sure legislation will plummet bitcoins price, but everyone who bought bitcoin should have already taken this into consideration. If anything banning bitcoin/crypto will be good because it will only lower fees and kill any unnecessary hype, and maybe less people will buy these ridiculous shitcoin floating all over. \n\nMonero is hated by governments, yet it\u2019s still liquid, functional, and accepted by a lot of places online. If a coin you hold can\u2019t say the same in an event of an outright ban you need to sell right now.",

Charles talks a lot about Africa but please be my guest and look for an solid evidence of ANY real work being done in Africa. He has also made many self contradicting statements about ADA and imo any coin that has a face behind it is already getting too centralized.\n\nI used to love ethereum, but Eth 2 is a disgrace and getting rid of mining in favor of a \u201crich get richer\u201d scheme is awful. Economics aside their PoS model is highly censor-able. The requirements to run a node are so ridiculous you need to be rich, or run a company to actually participate in the network. So not only will the rich get richer, but average people can not actually contribute to the network, they can only receive handouts from staking pools, which are easily manipulated. All of this strays extremely far from the original \u201cdecentralized permission-less network\u201d aspect of crypto. What is the point of having a blockchain at that point? They might as well be a less efficient version of visa with the way they\u2019re headed. With that being said I doubt ethereum will ever see a ban hammer because they can and will easily form to any future legislation(unless govts outright ban all cryptocurrencies). It\u2019s also very crappy that they incorporate crappy tokenomics(burning) just to pump the price of the coin in efforts to make whales richer on top of everything else mentioned.\n\nBitcoin could see a major price dip in the event of major legislation, but the network will remain functional which is what really matters. Most of the confusion about crypto comes from people viewing it as an *investment*. At the start crypto wasn\u2019t ever meant to be an investment, it was meant to be a p2p digital cash. Over time more and more hype has built up around crypto for various reasons and now people almost always refer to it as a store of value rather than a currency which is very dangerous. It may be a store of value but that\u2019s only if it\u2019s actually being used out of necessity. Otherwise everyone is holding their bags full of shit waiting until their imaginary number comes. If you\u2019re interested in crypto buy some and see what places you can spend it at. Drive the market yourself, order online with crypto, and pay businesses in crypto if they offer it. \n\nEvery single day in all of these crypto subreddits(bitcoin, ethereum, you name it) the top posts are something to do with bitcoins price targets, and almost never anything about places to use your crypto, and it\u2019s obvious that the overwhelming majority of people holding crypto right now are only doing so because they think it will make them money, which is by definition the greater fool theory. I love crypto, I own crypto, but I don\u2019t want to be blissfully ignorant to what\u2019s really happening.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said before and I will say again, none of the price action matters as long as the networks are up and we can send eachother crypto and convert crypto into dollars, goods, services, etc. This is what crypto was meant to be, not a \u201chodl Lamborghini machine\u201d",

This is what decentralization was supposed to mean to begin with. That the system would not be regulated by a select few, but everyone\u2019s money would be secured by everyone.

Even the exchanges you use for your DeFi matter. \n\nI like exchanges who are open and indiscreet about their regulation and systems, funds and loans and all. Systems like Werewolf exchange with their DeFi protocol. They are run pretty well and I give them my full faith. Because they give me my DeFi security and don\u2019t try to cheat me out with difficult rules that I would not easily understand. \n\nDeFi will be triumphant in the end.

I don't even have to google this up, defi lost about 10-100x more then exchanges did to hacks and exploits, so tell me again how a smart contract is safer then an exchange.

            "selftext": "I started trying Phemex exchange today because kucoin has been acting sketchy lately in regards to its futures markets and leveraged tokens. I just sent a couple hundred over to Phemex to play with and see how i like it, and i am trying to withdraw to make sure its not a total scam. I cannot do KYC am a citizen of the great and powerful united states, so in order to withdraw I need to convert my USD to a coin for transfer to another exchange. To do this, they make you use something called \"crypto converter\" to change the usd they use for futures trading into crypto. However, the usd in my account does not show as available in the crypto converter, even though it shows as available in the futures exchange. Does anybody have any experience with this, or know how to fix it? Thanks.",
