            "selftext": "# IPv4 aka The Internet As We Know It\n\nWe use IPv4. It is the basis of the Internet as we know it, for now (yes, IPv6 is being used by some and is expected to replace it).\n\n# IPv5 -What Could Have Been\n\nIPv5 is an objectively superior technology to IPv4. IPv5 would have made certain things such as streaming faster.\n\nIPv5 died because nobody used it. Its lack of popularity killed it. A superior technology, ignored because no one else was using it, and therefore because no one was using it, no one else used it since it lacked enough people to be worthwhile.\n\n# Bitcoin Cash -What Could Have Been\n\nIPv5 reminds me of Bitcoin Cash.\n\nBitcoin Cash is a superior technology to Bitcoin. It makes transfers cheaper. It is a slightly sleeker code, but otherwise very simple.\n\nBitcoin Cash has been down tremendously from its ATH. While it has not completely died and is superior to most coins out there, it has ultimately died compared to its previous trajectory and the reality it has no realistic chance of regaining its former potential to overtake Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Cash in other words, is superior, but its lack of popularity has created a cycle of it not being adopted, just like what happened to IPv5.\n\n# IPv6 -What Is Inevitable\n\nIPv6 on the other hand is gaining steam and is 100% expected to replace IPv4 -but why? IPv6 essentially does tons of things, far more than IPv5 did, that elevate IPv4. It improves Internet speeds, Internet security, and increases the number of IPs one can add to IPv6 drastically compared to IPv4 and IPv5.\n\nIn other words, IPv6 will achieve what IPv5 did not, simply because it is a little more. It does a little more.\n\nIn fairness, a new IP version was not as pressing a few years ago, given that we had more IP addresses left to allocate to computers a few years ago, and thus were not as in-need of a new protocol, so all of this logic COULD be a moot point in this regard.\n\nHowever, I believe IPv6 was going to be shifted to even if we were not running out of space. Simply put, it offers so much more than IPv5, that it is not merely superior, but IMMENSELY superior.\n\n# Why Bitcoin Cash Will Likely Fail\n\nBitcoin Cash is superior to Bitcoin because it does exactly what Bitcoin does but with a lower cost.\n\nThis is completely, 100%, true.\n\nBut I need you all to understand a simple truth, too.\n\nSuperior, is not good enough for a social shift in power -MASSIVELY superior, will only move the needle just barely enough, for a social shift in power.\n\nThere are systems superior to present politics in varied Western countries, that do not gain traction because they lack enough popularity for people to bother switching to them. Liberalism, in its traditional context of overthrowing monarchism, did not happen for a very long time; not just because of militant oppression, but also because most did not think this or similar alternative systems to monarchy would actually prove effective, even if the idea was out there. Only when it proved abundantly necessary did people jump ship from monarchism to liberalism -they did not do so merely because it looked fun.\n\nBitcoin Cash is not going to become popular enough to surpass Bitcoin, because it just does not do enough to justify an entire social movement from one major currency to another, even if Bitcoin Cash is otherwise better. It is in other words, while superior, not superior enough to justify a massive socio-crypto-market shift. \n\nYou have to be multiple leagues better, for people to trust that everyone else, will eventually shift to you -it is otherwise socially just not worth the likely doomed-to-fail inorganic campaigning and social influence required to convince people to perform that shift.\n\nEven Ethereum at least tries to be a leap forward by doing something original that could prove to have some immensely useful benefits to programmers, even if it is a mountain of spaghetti code.\n\nBitcoin is a leap forward compared to its predecessor -banks.\n\nBitcoin Cash is a step forward compared to its predecessor -Bitcoin.\n\n**Bitcoin Cash is not a leap forward from Bitcoin, though.**\n\nThat is why Bitcoin Cash will fail.",

It does everything all the new VC funded centralized shitcoins does, which also means better than ETH - ie. fast, cheap, decentralized EVM smart contracts. \n\nAt the SAME time BCH does everything BTC does, just vastly better, the Bitcoin way. It also has the best Bitcoin variant of smart contract features and improvements for scaling.\n\nThis was the technical argument. But BCH also has the best UX overall. One of the reasons is of course the tech, but also because businesses in the BCH ecosystem care about UX.",

This will be even greater if / when BTC suffers its next congestion event, which might happen any time that the market slightly panics.\n\n  - BCH has shown that capacity of THOUSANDS of times that of BTC is possible on chain.

(We will ignore the fact that BCH is a living protocol at this point.)\n\nThere is no reference to any IPv6 equivalent (Let\u2019s ignore that too). \n\nBCH also eclipses ETH with its elegant sBCH code (Nothing to see here). \n\nRight. Moving on. Good Luck to you.",

BTC development was captured by a team that abandoned that goal even though they pretend they still seek it. BCH's fork was created to save the potential to achieve the Bitcoin dream. Until BCH can scale for massive worldwide adoption, your analysis may hold.\n\nBTC believers still have time to think they are the future. They do this by assuming no BCH fork will scale and have it's adoption go viral. The ability to serve the entire world is the leap forward needed to unseat BTC. Other bells and whistles may make it more popular than BTC someday, but scaling and viral growth are what's needed to make BTC seem less secure, tiny and unimportant in comparison. If a BCH scales and goes viral, BTC will remain a valuable antique with collector value.",

My trust is somehow proportional to the hash rate of the network. \n\nThen you haven't yet understood how Bitcoin functions. Currently almost all the blockreward that pays for hashrate comes from the coinbase. It is fixed and only goes up and down with price. Therefore hashrate is directly relate to price. And while all ways lead to rome it looks like all BTC features are derived from price, which is directly corespondent to media hype. But price is a finicky thing and if BTC isn't the darling of the masses anymore price might crumble, and with it hashrate and security.  \n\n\n> And yes I think I can see network effects on there eg. Lightning update etc.\n\nLightning is a mess, but yes in theory it could create a network effect, like any payment method. \n\n>So media helped increasing my hopium that my money will be stored good over time\n\nLet me rephrase that. My only hope and use case of this thing I hold is to sell it later for a higher price for the next one to hold it and hope it goes up in price. Sound awfully familiar to some scam. \n\nNo compare that to a crypto with a use case. There is lots I can do besides hodling and praying and selling. There is value in the coin by itself not just by mass delusion.   \n\n>Do you think my favorite shitcoin is more entitled to that ;)?\n\nYour favorite shitcoin with a use case other than SoV alone will beat BTC as soon as the the speculative hype bubble bursts.",
