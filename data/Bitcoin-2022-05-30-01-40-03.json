If you run a node, you know which other node is sending you a transaction, but there's no way to know if that node is the original source of the transaction or if it's just relaying it from another node.\n\nIf you run many nodes in different locations, you may get a better idea of what the original source is, as you can use things like timing information (the node you receive the earliest copy of a transaction from is likely closest to the source) to improve your estimate. However, there's never any certainty. A user in country A could run a node that's permanently connected to just one other node, in country B, and send all their transactions that way. Since the source node never makes any connections except for that one other node, you'll never see it as the origin.\n\nAlso, many users use light wallets, that aren't full nodes. These wallets connect to full nodes elsewhere and those nodes will be seen as transmitting the transaction. So a user might be sending a transaction from a light wallet in country A, but through a full node in country B. Any tracing attempt using public information will stop at country B.",
