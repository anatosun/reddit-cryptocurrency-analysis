What am I missing here? \n\nWould love to learn this.",

You don't have to carry any back to the store, but that wouldn't be optimal.  You could take a few huge bottles, but that wouldn't be optimal unless the refund is high enough.  So you sort  by refund/size and try to optimize the packing.  If two bottles are the same size, you carry the one that pays more.  If two bottles have. the refund amount you  choose the smaller of the two because it leaves more room for other bottles.\n\nA miner does the same. He sorts the mempool and chooses the highest transaction fees per byte.",
