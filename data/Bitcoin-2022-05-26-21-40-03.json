It sounds as if you're correlating oil to electric generation which is incorrect. Source: https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/fiscal-notes/2020/august/ercot.php\nDespite some of the extreme right wing folks here Texas is the #1 producer of wind energy in the United States. Many of your larger scale operations are working in Canada(hut8), Colorado, Georgia(clsk) and other places with renewables its not just Texas. Even with commercial rates of .06~/kwh renewables make more sense.\n\nBitcoin makes power grids more resilient by consuming excessive capacity that would otherwise get wasted. In terms of the ability to affect the hash rate, sure Texas offline would drop a bit but it would still cost in the multi billions of dollars to even attempt attacks if Texas went offline, thats the beauty of bitcoins decentralization. There is a financial incentive to stay online. \n\nThere are also millions of sq ft of new datacenters being built out in Abilene Texas area that are making direct utilization of the wind power (transmission lines to major cities is some what limited so being extremely close they can negotiate insanely cheap power rates).",

I assume that as oil moves up other energy costs trend up with it. Stranded energy is probably an exception due to long term contracts for data centers and lack of competitive demand. The question I was trying to ask is if there is a risk (even a small one) of energy costs globally moving up so high at a time when the Bitcoin price is stubbornly low driving enough miners offline that it creates a risk broadly to the network? It sounds like one of the best protections against that is continuing to lock up stranded energy at discounted rates and to distribute the hash rate globally as much as possible. What else can we do to strengthen the network?",

They're either faux decentralized (not actually centralized in any meaningful way) networks that might claim some small innovation but for the fact that decentralization is the killer app. They're not interesting at all without it. Creating centralized software is nothing special. It's easy. Therefore technologically they're low value. These are virtually all created by venture capitalists who pump their projects to keep the liquidity up just long enough for them to dump. I can see why investors and gamblers find these interesting, but ideologically I recognize them as a waste of human talent and ambition. I don't buy lotto tickets for the same reason.\n\nThe second category of alts are actual forks of Bitcoin, usually without any innovation whatsoever. Sometimes communities form around these for the memes, and the communities serve to pump. In the end, it's still a pump and dump game. Despite the memes, these aren't any more of a joke than the VC coins -- actually they're probably more serious contenders to Bitcoin because at least they have a modicum of decentralization -- it's just that more people are in on the joke of how technologically worthless these networks are, whereas the VCs were able to pay a lot of marketing money to make people believe their projects are at all interesting.\n\nEither way, alts are a waste of time. They're trying to find a reason to exist, while Bitcoin already claims world-changing aspirations. There's no loftier ambition than to earn a spot as a world reserve money. The ambitions of alts, trading silly jpegs or \"defi\" without the \"de\", are cute by comparison.",

It's telling that the main orchestrators of attacks to Bitcoin aren't by nocoiners but by altcoiners: Bitcoin suffers from severe FUD and manipulative narratives, when not blatant lies (that Bitcoin doesn't have smart contracts, that one does not need to run their own node, that Satoshi mine one million coins, just to name a few). \n\nWhen it's so clear that altcoiners miss no opportunity to throw Bitcoin under the ESG bus, I'm shocked to hear that they still expect sympathy from bitcoiners.",
