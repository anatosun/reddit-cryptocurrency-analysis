I know it's not much but we have some good knowledge about crypto, we also do a lot of research before investing.\n\nA couple of months ago, we both bought Fantom. We strongly believe in it and it's project so we put the majority of our money in it.\n\nYesterday, while we were having dinner, my brother told me that he sold all his crypto. I was really surprised to hear that because he never sold at loss. I tried to know why and he told me that he didn't panic sell, he got tired of trading and that it's so stressing so he ended the bullshit. He invested about 17k and now was left with 2k.\n\nI think that he got out in the worst possible moment and that he should wait for market recovery before quitting. I am thinking of advising him to buy again, what do you guys think?",

We don't mind hodling for months.\n\nHere's basically what we were doing : \nWe would wait for the market to go down heavily, like 15% to 20% on the last 24h and we would enter with a part of our money and put a sell a limit at about 8% or 10%. If the market goes down more, we would enter with another part of the money and set another sell limit for 10%. With this technique, we almost never sold at loss. We were basically doing dollar cost averaging, it didn't require much time and it was working quite well, but that was in a bull market. Our strategy If the bear market came was to just hodl and wait for the bull run again, we don't mind waiting for months, but now my brother got tired of all this and told me that the money is not worth the time and the stress so he just quit.",
