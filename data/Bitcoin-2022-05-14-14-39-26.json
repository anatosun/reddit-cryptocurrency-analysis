According to the announcement china had a different thought they viewed it as a property and this was a relief to investors. According to reports, it was confirmed that Bitcoin is a virtual property as the Shanghai People's Court, issued a statement on their Official WeChat Channel regarding Bitcoin. \nThis got many people surprised because the Chinese government has not lifted the ban on crypto trading. During the main trial practice the Shanghai People's Court formed a unified opinion that Bitcoin is a or will be identified as a virtual property and Bitcoin has a noticeable economic value that conforms to the properties attributes. This calls for the Legal rules of property to apply for the protection of Bitcoin. \nEveryone observing the confusing behavior of the crypto world and the Chinese government by their harsh banning of Bitcoin and expelling its miners from the country in 2021  got people confused.\nRecently, data from website traffic metric supplier Similarweb showed that crypto exchanges like Deribit, FaithTribe, OKX and Threedium still get huge traffic from China where the major portion of the participation is from the Decentralized Finance Sector.\nCheng Mou filed a case against Shi MouMou in Shanghai Baoshan District People's Court telling the court to issue an official statement about BBitcoin because Shi MouMou was meant to return a Bitcoin to Cheng Mou in 2020 when none of them agreed to come to an agreement the High court had to intervene.",

The people who are pulling money out now are the over leveraged trader types. The price is set on the margins and they are driving it down. When they finish selling off we will find out what is the true value of the HODLERS portion of the market. Then, we have a long slow float in the doldrums for a while until someone influential says something bullish publicly. Everyone will flood back in and a percentage of the new comers will become Hodlers because they see it for what it is. Some of the OGs will take a bit of profit to diversify but the class of 22 will just celebrate their paper wins and hold through the next dip. Each time the elevator goes up a floor we gain some and loose some. The views from the top are going to be legendary and I brought snacks for the ride up.",

However, in many ways, I see this as a blessing because it was the wake-up call I needed to realise most of these shitcoins that have fancy protocols and VCs propping them up are all ploys to swindle the money of hard-working retail investors.\n\nPeople have to realise that this shitcoin at one point was the 4th largest crypto with the 2nd most TVL. Furthermore, when adding their stablecoin shitcoin to the mix, the total market cap of them combined as a whole was 80 billion dollars and all of this was wiped away within the space of 36 hours! The importance of these figures is to convey to people that if this can happen to them it can happen to any of the other shitcoins out there too.\n\nThe majority of the news that is coming out post-attack, is indicating that this was a George Soros type attack and someone exploited the protocol to make a massive profit. Therefore, many people in that shitcoin community are still hopeful of a relaunch with new tokens being compensated to the previous holders. This is nothing but pure ignorance as these people have to realise whilst yes the attack was unfortunate, the fact that there was a weakness in the design of the protocol that allowed it to be exploited in the first place should signify the dangers of these coins.\n\nThis type of attack happening to Bitcoin would be practically impossible as Bitcoin has excellent infrastructure with good security and a stable network. It has proved to be reliable and resilient over the course of the last 13 years. It has survived numerous debacles such as Mt Gox, Silk Road, Blocksize wars and claims from fraudulent individuals claiming to be the founder. There is no face to it that can influence the decisions of the community, therefore, forcing the community to find a consensus to aid Bitcoin in evolving. It is for reasons among many more that I could list that from now on I will only invest in Bitcoin in regards to crypto.\n\nPlease if any of you are holding coins other than Bitcoin please just sell them and stick to Bitcoin. Take it from me, someone who has been in the community of a shitcoin and seen the destruction and carnage that ensued as a result of its demise. The easiest way to summarise it is if I asked you will your favourite shitcoin be here in 5 years the answer is most likely no but with Bitcoin, it's a guaranteed yes so save yourself the pain and time.",

But if the stock market losses keep going, and unemployment numbers hit 9 to 10%, the FED has to cancel the next rate increase, because they have to keep unemployment numbers low as well.\n\nIt's a see-saw. They change the strategy from week to week.\n\nBut the market reacts instantly to the news, and then gradually balances back, and we see small runs again.\n\nThere's a good recent video that explains the details of these macro-economics:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DHY8sWt7EOE\n\nI think the takeaway is this...\n\nThe FED is creating a perception of Fear and Panic.\n\nBut this is only temporarily tightening the trading in the market. \n\nIt almost looks purposeful, like they're trying to get retail investors to sell at a loss, while hedgies swoop in and buy everything at a 35-50% discount.\n\nThen they reverse the FUD, market rebounds, hedgies sell, and cause another FUD dump with lower-lows.\n\nThey're just playing with us at this point.\n\nIf you really don't need to access the money for 2-3 years, don't sell. And if you have cash, DCA when those -25% -35% intervals are hit, expecting that they will appear.\n\nI don't think the Fear is legitimate, it looks manufactured.\n\nAnd if you know anything about the options that the FED has these days (hint: no options, they MUST print more money sooner or later, regardless of interest rates), then you know that future Inflation is guaranteed. \n\nAnd whether it is today or in two years, Bitcoin will react to all the new money supply and velocity in the system.",

It's probably institutions like start ups, exchanges or hedge funds deep in bitcoin who need actual cash so they have to sell bitcoin, thus the price going down. It's not necessarily a bunch of dumb reddit users with 1/4 of bitcoin like most people here. That's why bitcoin price is correlated with the stock market, thus VC in general, the VC money is drying up, so a lot of companies that might have invested into bitcoin are short in funding thus need to sell their bitcoins, nothing more, nothing less. Eventually a lot of these companies will go bankrupt, bitcoin or not.\n\nPeople sharing memes here are irrelevant and have zero power to tank bitcoin.",

Would I be happy if the price was $5k? No. And somewhere between there is the transition. Do I think I'll ever be able to get BTC for $5k again? Also no.   \n\n\nThe goal for most BTC investors is to capitalize on low prices when they're available so that we can have more of an asset that we deem valuable and many others also believe is valuable. Last ATH, I think we dropped a total of 85% in the bear market afterwards. And the ATH before that, wasn't it closer to 90%? I don't remember exactly. Even if we drop to $17k, that's \"only\" a 75% drop from ATH. If we drop to $22k, that's a 68% drop from ATH. Over time with more adoption and more investment, the drops from ATH get less and less. 90% > 85% > 70% (maybe) etc etc. It's never going to be completely flat because it's so easy to trade, and that ease of trading is one of the many benefits.",

I\u2019m paying 3-10x as much, just because I moved on to other interests when the bull run ended. \n\nI have few regrets. I\u2019m grateful as all hell that I bought what I did in 2017, and had the good sense to HODL it in multisig. But I wish I had taken my own advice and DCA\u2019d. \n\nBitcoin is going to be in the media less. Your friend groups and Reddit subs will become less active for a year or two. But don\u2019t forget about Bitcoin. \n\nKeep learning more. \nKeep orange-pulling people.\nSet up a weekly DCA buy, and forget about that instead. \n\nYou\u2019ll thank me in 2024-2025.",

I have a subtle buy at 25k, moderate buy at 22k, and fairly big (in comparison to my account at least) at 20k.  I dont' see it dropping below 10k without a major event happening like a nuclear bomb going off or something equivalent.  I could be wrong, but it would take a major event like that and if thats the case, everythings fucked let alone bitcoin.  I do expect the price to hit sub 25k though.  And yes I agree, the sub 20k market while unlikely is on the table, and would definitely make things spicy.  We still have a long way to go to the next halving, something to keep in mind, and since more and more people are holding in exchanges, it could change how bitcoin is percieved as retailers holding on exchanges is not the same as retailers holding in their own personal wallets.\n\nThese are my opinions and do not constitute financial advice, as usual.",

Therefore, any attempts to make a second POW chain is fraught with risk over the long term. This is great for Bitcoin. Terrible for every other project.\n\nPOS requires control over the majority of tokens, which means that you need to buy enough tokens (in many cases 33% is all you need) in order to attack it. The price going down is not enough to attack a POS chain though. You need the actual adoption to go down (meaning its not just the liquid supply going negative but new supply getting scared and also selling).\n\nSo if any utility does manage to somehow emerge on these chains, the liquidity of each cannot be easily converted to attack another chain. You cannot simply buy 33% of the tokens at the market rate (unless 33% of tokens are actually up for sale at the current rate or can be easily scared into doing so). In most cases this massive of a purchase attempt would shoot the price into the stratosphere making it impossible for you to afford buying them all... and if you still did, exploiting the chain would likely hurt you more than it would hurt anyone else.\n\nThat said, just like small POW chains are vulnerable to attack, small POS chains will be easily attacked. This is because smart money can create a trading channel to acquire tokens while keeping prices low (given the chain has users who are mostly speculating and don't have strong hands).\n\nGiven most of these chains are completely speculation, the attack becomes possible.",

They don't understand the above, and are in a true, reactive panic. For zero good reason.\n2. Their BTC economics are tied to external factors.\n\nIf you're a hodler, neither of this matters. 1BTC is still 1BTC, there's no flood in the market, and short term supply bumps from sellers are just going to be absorbed eventually by buyers. \n\nBe happy it costs less to acquire today than a week ago!",

This is wrong in some ways: it is not a stock/company/dependent on the fiat economy.  It is right in other ways: it is speculative, emergent technology, not well understood.\n\nBut note that gold is also not pumping.  That is because the US Dollar is very strong right now, even with inflation.  Stocks are likely still over-valued.  Other currencies are not safer than the USD.  Crypto is scary, uncertain, and thought to be over-valued.  The US Dollar is certain and safe.  We have a general idea of what the fed and US gov will do.  Inflation sucked during the last year, but interest rates are going up to help with inflation pains, and hyperinflation is far far away, especially when you compare the USD to other fiat currencies.  Even 10% inflation feels better than risking another 50% drop in stocks or bitcoin to battered market participants.\n\nTLDR, everyone is scared as shit.

Sure, it went up a lot so it is correcting now, but it seems there was a big corelation between inflation and the bitcoin price. If money supply increased by 40%, one might think that the price of bitcoin would increase by 40% at least. So from 10k before the pandemic to 14k-20k sounds like a reasonable price. Although there is many other factors in the economy to consider. By the way, I refer to inflation as increasing (or inflating) the money supply and not the price increase which is a consequence of the increase in money supply just so we have the same definitions.",

                    "response": "Lets discuss some of the properties of what makes a good currency and where Bitcoin fits now compared to gold and fiat\n\n\n**1) Durability** = Gold is best here due to its history and physical nature. Bitcoin and fiat  being digital in nature means we must compare the  durability of the institution/network that issues and secures them. I would suggest that Bitcoin will slightly excel responsible nation states here and does far better than  unreliable forms of fiat when looking at the history of fiat compared the the history and properties of Bitcoin(2017 gave a lot of credibility to Bitcoin in it thwarting a powerful attack and nation states have repeatedly attacked Bitcoin to one degree or another)\n\n**2) Portability** = Gold is horrible in this category being physical, heavy and unable to be sent digitally(custodians don't count as you lose most the benefits of gold and it switched categories from a bearer asset to registered value). Bitcoin beats fiat here too as its peer to peer , global and lacks regulatory friction. \n\n**3) Fungibility** Gold and bitcoin tie here. When comparing fiat to Bitcoin it is more complicated but Bitcoin beats fiat here overall and is significantly getting better each year. Physical fiat has some advantages over Bitcoin in the sense that its easier to have strong privacy locally as long as the whole \"anonymity set\" (group of users) avoid depositing the fiat in ATMs and banks(physical cash has serial numbers that are tracked with OCR + bill readers everywhere). Bitcoin can be very private if you use the right wallet and you take precautions but if you make a mistake onchain you can also have problems. Bitcoin being used with a lightning wallet is extremely private by default and chain analysis is useless. Digital fiat isn't very fungible or private at all. Gold isn't as fungible as many people suggest either due to different grading, certifying prices, forms which all fetch different prices.\n\n**4) Scarcity** -- Bitcoin wins this hands down with a fixed and limited supply. ~2-4 million BTc have been permanently lost/destroyed and many people also a long term investors leading to more scarcity. Gold is a distant 2nd with concerns in asteroid mining - (Psyche 16 as an example) and not knowing if any other large deposit can be found but far superior to fiat. \n\n**5) Divisibility** Bitcoin is already divisible by 8 decimal places onchain and 1/1000 of a satoshi on other layers like lightning. Thus micro txs are possible with bitcoin and too impractical with gold and not as easily done with fiat due to regulatory friction  and costs. The idea is that machines and software can tip other software, machines, and services by the minute or second to allow for more granularity and thus more efficiency with lower prices.\n\n**6) Acceptability** - Fiat wins this category for the time being due to its acceptance worldwide , especially US dollars. Bitcoin being a global currency without regulatory friction can one day overtake even the most accepted fiat however. Almost no one accepts gold for payment so its last and this is unlikely to change. \n\n**7) Verifiability** - Bitcoin wins here slightly over gold and fiat. Gold can be verified but takes more effort and there are concerns with tungsten filled bars and fake gold. Bitcoin being swept from a private key(coin or paper) or accepting an open dime is better than fiat physical cash, and digital fiat has very large concerns and delays in verification (chargebacks, fraud, etc...)\n\n**8) stability as a unit of account** - While Bitcoin is better than certain forms of fiat in this category, most are more stable than bitcoin and so Bitcoin remains 3rd compared to fiat and gold. We hope that Bitcoin in time will become less volatile with a much larger market cap . This trend is already occurring ,and much economic theory supports this happening but its still an experiment as to how long it will take and what size market cap / liquidity is needed\n\nSo you can see bitcoin is already better than fiat in 6 of the 8 categories above and the 2 remaining categories just take time.",

Lets keep her afloat until their games and bullshit allow fiat to work for maybe 3 months before stocks/bonds come crashing down again.,   print print print,  hand out hand out,  we all know those people that think such is good for the nobody,  well sad truth is those in charge just melted there brains as bad as them folks and this clown show will not end for awhile.  Bitcoin will win the war,  the tiny battles lost mean nothing,  in the end it is superior thus why they wish to control and monitor all cryptos.   If it makes profits we the people cannot have it for long in their heads,. this is not opinion this is our history and that is so very easy to prove in less than 10- mins without any doubt",

Kindly stay on chat.\n\n15:49, May 12\n\nYou: Thank you\n\n15:52, May 12\n\nCarmille: I'm still checking your account. Please bear with me for 5 minutes while I'm doing my review. Kindly stay on chat.\n\n15:52, May 12\n\nYou: ok\n\n15:56, May 12\n\n**Carmille: Thank you for patiently waiting. Your account is temporarily suspended from sending cryptocurrency off the Coinbase platform - this is to protect against loss, because once funds are sent off our platform, we have no way to reverse those transactions.**\n\n**15:56, May 12**\n\n**Carmille: This feature will not be re-enabled until May 19, 2022 at the earliest. Due to the current restrictions on your account, if you would like to send this crypto from Coinbase, you must first convert the crypto to fiat and then withdraw the fiat funds to your verified bank account.**\n\n**15:56, May 12**\n\n**Carmille: Digital currency accounts can be a target for potential scams. The only information a merchant, vendor, or seller would properly request is the receiving address for your wallet. Anyone asking for any other account information is likely a scam.**\n\n**15:56, May 12**\n\n**Carmille: Please also be aware of \"investment opportunities\", as any service requesting that you send crypto to an external wallet address in order to receive returns on an investment are likely scams.**\n\n**15:56, May 12**\n\n**Carmille: Do not share security information with others. Coinbase users are solely responsible for the security of devices, passwords, e-mail, and 2-factor verification codes. To ensure that you avoid any potential future digital currency scams, please read our Help page:**\n\n15:59, May 12\n\nYou: i didnt agree to this, i accept the risk of what i do with my crypto currency, please un-restrict my account\n\n15:59, May 12\n\nYou: this isnt a feature this is the core purpose of your platform\n\n16:01, May 12\n\nCarmille: We can see how important this is to you. Let me just review this further, I'll need another 4 minutes here.\n\n16:06, May 12\n\nCarmille: Thank you for your patience. We can't guarantee a change to your current account status, and any decision based on our review will be final. We're also not able to provide additional information regarding this account review.\n\n16:06, May 12\n\nCarmille: Thank you for your patience as we complete this process; we'll follow up by email once this review has been completed.\n\n16:08, May 12\n\nYou: I have done nothing to violate the terms or service agreements. There is zero basis to justify and account restriction now that my identity has been verified\n\n16:08, May 12\n\nYou: all i wanted to do was test my ability to transfer but now i am seriously considering the FIAT conversion and leaving your platform entirely.\n\n16:11, May 12\n\nCarmille: We know this isn't the ideal experience. Our team is currently reviewing your account. Account review times fluctuate depending on our queue. We try to complete account reviews as quickly as possible, and we'll let you know when your account review is complete, but we have no update for you at this time.\n\n16:11, May 12\n\nCarmille: If you don't receive an update from us in six calendar days, please contact us so we can check the status of your review.",

They had a built in migration process which move all our BTC across. I think this process retained some proprietary BRD deviration path which has become troublesome.\n\nI just do not want to stay on a Coinbase Wallet so I tried importing my pass phrase to an alternative wallet like BlueWallet and this is where I discover that despite having my Key it is not enough and there is a missing amount of BTC that simply will not import  (but is showing on Coinbase Wallet, it is not lost but I can\u2019t import it elsewhere). Apparently this is because it\u2019s derivation path can not be detected by the importing algorithm on the wallets! I\u2019ve apparently got a mix of legacy and Segwit and others but even then it is not detecting everything. I had never even heard of the derivation path until this happened.\n\nI guess I need to send, as a transaction, my BTC from the Coinbase Wallet to a new wallet (rather then import) but that is going to trigger a fee, right? What other options have I got and have I understood the problem properly?",

The probability wave will interfere with the personal probability waves of everyone that reads it to cause the market to move in the opposite direction of your investment plays.  The only ways to counteract this are to either do nothing or spread your personal probability waves in the q-time domain by buying or selling at regular intervals (\"DCA\").

Most bitcoiners said to stay away from other coins, that they weren\u2019t decentralized and safe. At the begging I didn\u2019t understand, even believed that other coin could be better. But as the years passed and learned more about bitcoin, it made more sense (bought E.T.H only once for $40, sold for 45$ lol). Unfortunately, these past few days are a catastrophic example that many people are learning the hard way why you shouldn\u2019t put considerable money on shitcoins. But that\u2019s the free market, nobody is going to bail you out.\n\nSo, thanks to all the bitcoiners that taught me to stay away from other coins, stay safe and stacks sats!",

            "selftext": "I don't believe we'll face any trouble with network security in the future when the block subsidy collapses below 1BTC (it's currently 6.25BTC and will be .012BTC in 2070) for many reasons, one being that block sizes will probably trend up to 5MB at least by then from the 2MB we sometimes hit in the mempool today, and miners will be using renewable baseload energy and renewable flexible load energy, both cheap. I mean we're already at 56% renewable, which partly explains why some miners have maintained profitability even as oil has price shocked us, hashpower relentlessly increases, and the price of the network's lone asset (BTC) falls. We'll probably be at 99% renewable before 2028. Also miners can simply incentivize larger transactions costs if a user wants faster L1 tx's or LN channel closings like they do now with half-filled or empty blocks--although these lessen with each halving and fall with decreasing energy inputs. I think the main cost of mining overhead will eventually get driven into ASIC silicon, and the secondary ASIC market will get gobbled up by quantum and AI computing needs. But even so, I like romanticizing the outlier solutions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ha6awpx9j5z81.png?width=1364&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e67d8ecd7515c7c75f9ca5f1bfaa2e52b5fe033\n\nI think we could seed 100 years (2070-2170) worth of huge mining transaction fees for only $60M today. Sats are .00028\u00a2. If BTC absorbs enough trust, then a $20M price in today's purchasing power per BTC is easily achievable. That would give it a \\~$400T mkt cap. Might help keep the network even more decentralized? Or maybe it doesn't matter, because the larger the network gets the more decentralized it becomes anyway. I don't even believe bitcoin's privacy mechanism (pseudonymity) has even woken up yet and won't until we have a circular economy (enough goods and services sold in BTC that exchanges are completely optional) and billions of unique data sets (global layered transactions on L1/L2) per day. Or could seeding the tx's be a bad idea? \n\nYes, I think it's an absolutely terrible idea. That's the type of manipulative stability Central Banks and stablecoins try for. It's at odds with the free market. The reason I'm against it is we don't know what BTC's price will be or what energy inputs will be, so if these seeded tx fees overthrow the overall cost per block avg for miners, they could actually end up raising our children's transaction costs dramatically and artificially mess with the mining economy of scale, which could lead to incentivizing centralization somehow. No chicanery. \n\nLastly, bitcoin doesn't target a stable price. It targets a variable price. Its one directional entropy (PoW) can control the supply and issuance. The free market sets the price. That's what a real free market looks like, which nobody lives in anymore. They're only familiar with bank asset purchases, bailouts, stimulus, printing, liquidity provision, credits, tax schemes, and war machines. That's why BTC is so beautifully volatile. It's working. It's early in its monetization phase. When it's absorbed enough trust (and thus value), its confidence curve will flatten (and thus volatility). \n\nLet's not be this guy:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6vs45iplj5z81.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d6a2b3d66c9d363aa84d5ef89e2c519fadbecd9",

I also only invested what I don\u2019t have any need to sell for decades. So, do you believe in Bitcoin? Do you want to buy into it because you think it\u2019s good for society and you want to use it yourself? Then it\u2019s always a good time to buy because 1 Bitcoin will always be worth 1 Bitcoin.",

The price was near it's ATH and everyone was saying \"man I wish I had bought in when the price was half if what it is now!\".  You might remember this.\n\nNext we travel six months into the future.  It's Nov 22, everyone is anticipating the mid term elections, Thanks Giving, and Black Friday.  Inflation is down, the economy is showing signs of recovering, and you are as happy as your dog gets when you come home from work because you bought bitcoin back in May when the price was under $30k.  Everyone is jealous but they think you're a genius.\n\nNow we travel back to the present, welcome back!  I hope you understand what you must do.",

This is like what, my 7th, 8th dip of such magnitude? But the difference each time is higher highs and higher lows. Prices we once were excited about are now prices we are disappointed about. The stock market, bitcoin, shitcoins, everything is down. So you cannot single out bitcoin, it's illogical.\n\nThe longer you've been holding Bitcoin, the less these dips phase you. Especially when you have daily hashrate ATHs, more adoption/discussion than ever before, and so much more.\n\nSo please, don't let short-term negative price movements get to you. It's not always going to be up up up. There will be many of such dips in between the ATHs. The difference is: Will you make use of them? Or will you run away scared?",

I've been lurking here and on /biz/ for a long time and each dip / bullrun is a re-run of the last in terms of reactions and psychology. Every bullrun has greed of a high price target and every dip is panic about this being the end (for real this time\u2122). Furthermore, when it's rapidly rising, nobody wants to miss the rollercoaster and when it's falling, nobody wants to catch a falling knife. These reactions are always the same.\n\nI've always been a Bitcoin maxi, but I was not always the confident holder I am now, that is because in my early Bitcoin days, I had far less money in general. In these earlier days, I've sold sizable amounts of my BTC at 3x-5x gains, and now it would've been far far more. But one thing for sure is that I've only gained over all this time. Even at this exact point in time, most of my coins are at least multiple times up from the time I received them at.\n\nThe most important part is just to be rational, and having a solid understanding of bitcoin helps a lot. And of course having some fiat set aside for times like this to avoid having to sell BTC at stupidly low prices.",

I remember reading nothing but falling knife comments, one after the other. It\u2019s easy to look back and see how obvious it was to buy in at 4K but at the time I remember being terrified to pull the trigger. I kept reading that it was going to keep dropping, don\u2019t buy now, wait till $1000. Luckily I did buy in around the 4-5K range but nowhere near what I wish I had.\n The sentiment of this sub was what held me back from putting more in. Since then it has been a wild ride and I was nervous DCAing in at every step. I was scared to buy in the 6K range, 7,8,9, every time I got a pit in my stomach hitting the buy button. Every time I bought and it dropped I felt like a moron and a rube, but now looking back I am so happy I did. Don\u2019t let yourself get shook out.\n If you buy here and it drops to 20k just simmer down and hodl. That\u2019s all you have to do, one of the best quotes I've learned during my time in this space is investing is the impatient giving their money to the patient. Or something like that. That\u2019s harder than it sounds because we are inundated with either massive FUD or over the top hopium of \u201cparabolic moon mission imminent!!!\u201d Just buy in during these dips as much as you can afford without overextending yourself and wait. You won\u2019t time the bottoms so stop trying\u2026\n I held off buying around the 11k range because at that time in this space everybody was saying that you\u2019re dumb to buy because the belief was BTC would fill the CME gap at 9.6K. So I waited\u2026 and waited\u2026 12K, 12.5K, 13. Down to 11.5 again! Here comes the inevitable gap fill!! Then BLAMMO we were looking at 14, 15,000 prices! Fuck! Guess I\u2019ll buy now haha.\n Moral of the story is nobody fucking knows what\u2019s gonna happen.",

It takes a lot of mental courage, patience and strength to see through these bear markets but we need to remember that in the end, the bear market buys are what will make you financially set for life. its hard to buy when everything is tanking and easy to buy when the market is high due to the psychology of it all.

Tor is banned (Bisq is Tor-based) in Iran, but if he/she has a little technical know how, finding a bridge to connect to around the ban shouldn't be difficult. I'm not aware however, of how many local Iran users Bisq has. Mallardshead has a longterm solution to the latter: \n\nWhen a need like this exists, a huge business opportunity exists. What your Persian friend needs is an entrepreneurial spirit to fulfill this need. Start with a small F2F (face to face) operation on Bisq. Demand will rapidly outstrip supply trust me, I know a guy that does this in Cuba. Sell at a small premium. The Iranian Rial trades at .000024\u00a2 to the USD, which means:\n\nONE SATOSHI EQUALS 12 RIAL!!!\n\nYou literally could seed an F2F operation there in Rial and BTC for $500 or \u20bf.02\n\nSo tell your friend to get on Bisq, start selling F2F. They also need to put together a one paragraph cheat-sheet on how plebs (non-technical users) can connect to Bisq. Circulate it. Ask for the bitcoin community's help, let them know what you are doing. \n\nThere is no Iranian Bisq volume? You become the Iranian Bisq volume. Hire friends/people for the deliveries if need be. It will grow. If they do this, well I'm on Bisq, tell your friend to give me their handle there, I'll come in with a little funding and we'll do a small fundraiser if he/she gets this going. I'll contact everyone from Alex Gladstein's organization to the mods here. Would be nice for this sub to earn their own orange patch \u2734\ufe0f. Let's orange pill those fucking ayatollahs!",

He showed that he could generate and display a compromised seed phrase on a user's Nano Ledger S by downloading modified MCU firmware onto the Ledger. This showed that a malicious 3rd party could do this to a customer's Ledger if it was tampered with before the customer received it for the first time.\n\n(source here: [https://saleemrashid.com/2018/03/20/breaking-ledger-security-model/](https://saleemrashid.com/2018/03/20/breaking-ledger-security-model/))\n\nGiven this information and the steps I have taken to upgrade my Ledger's firmware to the most recent version, would you consider this Ledger Nano S safe for use? If not, what would you recommend doing?\n\nThanks in advance for the feedback.",

I'd say the number and profile of the true believers has increased though. Back then it was mostly nerds, now you've got some finance people, billionaires, etc, who are included. For me, I was a light skeptic but at this point I'm convinced bitcoin isn't going anywhere and will act as a sort of [grey goo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_goo) of the financial world.",

Some tough lessons that this sub doesn't like\n\nBTC is a high beta asset that sort of acts like leveraged QQQ. Risk on => Rallies, Risk off => Crashes hard. Right now it's not a storehold of wealth or an inflation hedge or anything of that sort though it might become one in the future.\n\nLesson 1 of holding BTC - Don't fight the Fed.\n\nLesson 2 is that the supply matters. Halvenings cause price to rally and it doesn't get priced in until it actually happens for some reason. Reduced supply coupled with easy money causes BTC to rally hard. I don't know if we've seen what happens when btc halves but monetary conditions are tight.\n\nWhere are we going now? That depends on what your view is for the terminal fed funds rate. If you have an opinion (2%? 3%? More?) then you can time the BTC run too (along with most tech stocks, meme stocks etc). The key indicator to look at is the US 10yr breakeven rate (a proxy for long term inflation in the US).\n\nIf you really have enough conviction to hold no matter what happens then you'll probably be fine eventually.\n\nIf you have cash you're waiting to deploy, I'd say start DCAing in now with the understanding that things can get quite a bit worse (peak to trough drawdowns for BTC are 80% ish). For this cycle that's around $14k. Please correct me if my math is wrong here.\n https://medium.com/galaxy-digital-research/contextualized-analysis-of-bitcoin-drawdowns-f4717ff8e3be\n\nIt is impossible to time the bottom or the top. Don't go all in with your cash, go in with 5-10% increments.",

            "selftext": "This sub has been a guilty pleasure of mine for almost 8 years now.  The memes, the fear, the panic, and the echo chamber quality of it all.  But above all, I stay for the quality memes.  Here are some of my musings.  Hopefully it can offer some comfort for those of you who bought at ATH.\n\n1) Don't mention explicitly the total amount that you have.  I made this mistake early on and the amount of \"advice\" I got to sell from the original run from 1000 to 3000 was incredibly irritating.  You cannot imagine how much louder it got from the 17k or 18k peak when it went all the way back down to 4k or 5k.  The panic was everywhere.  Do not be surprised if the same happens again on this downturn. \n\n2) Stick to the fundamentals.  Price discovery does not necessarily reflect the underlying value of bitcoin.  Are blocks being mined? Are transactions being processed? If yes, just keep your head down and continue holding.  I anticipate, even expect, that bitcoin will keep getting attacked; bad actors will keep coming and going (Jihan, your tweet will forever be hilarious).  If you want to do your part (and can afford to), run a node.  \n\n3) Please do not trade (including leveraged trades).  I started off as a \"trader\".  I started with 100 and tried to do the compound math game of closing the day with 5% gains.  Being able to pull it off for a few days in a row (in a bull market), I thought I was a genius then all those years ago.  After a month, however, I ended up with slightly less than 100.  Then, by a sheer stroke of luck, it clicked for me that trading was a fool's game.  Most traders lose.  I did not think I was the exception to the rule.  It was after this moment I started to just quickly buy and hold.  \n\n4) For whatever reason, being in bitcoin has somehow changed my spending habits and how I view material things.  I try to live on less and I try to unsubscribe from the endless consumerism that is everywhere.  It almost feels as if unchecked consumerism, inflation, and capitalism are all somehow interconnected for me.  Someone else can probably word it more eloquently.  \n\n5) I have found it helpful to view bitcoin as a savings vehicle.  I continue to buy today, even when it was above 55000, 40000, etc.  It does not matter.  I just want to protect what \"value\" I have in FIAT from getting eroded by monetary policies that do not quite seem to benefit the small fish.  \n\n6) I have not found it helpful to talk about it with friends and family.  So I mostly stay quiet now, even going so far as to feign ignorance on the topic if needed.  I think I am terrible at explaining it (might be why).  The reactions I have seen over the years are is that it is fake, can be manipulated, what if it goes to 0, what if I am wrong, and when will I sell?  I rarely try to correct their thinking.  I do subscribe to the quote that people will buy into it at the price they deserve.  \n\n~~7) I must confess, I have not read the whitepaper.  I have copies of it, but I have never read it.  Yes, this is heresy.~~  At the encouragement of some, I mustered up the courage to read the whitepaper.  It was not as scary as I thought!  Thanks!\n\n8) I do not own anything else.  I just do not understand it.  There are so many technical terms now that are thrown around.  It is intimidating.  I remember receiving messages back in the day when a certain coin, starting with E, was priced at $3.  Maybe some of you can too.  What I have seen, however, is that a lot of these other things come and go, like the seasons.  I wonder why that is. \n\n9) Stay for the memes! \n\nI cannot and do not say these things in real life anymore.  May this help some of you new bitizens in this space.\n\nPS. Hopefully, I did not make any typing errors.  English is not my main language!\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold and love awards random bitizens! Never gotten these before =)",

I have copies of it, but I have never read it. Yes, this is heresy.\n\nThe whitepaper is only eight pages with a few pages of light cryptography/math and one page of sources. It's very easy to read and understand, please just read it and remember this was only supposed to be kind of a proof-of-concept but has become so much more along the way. It goes a long way to gauging how you should approach Bitcoin that it came from such humble beginnings and continues to persist today. Vires in numeris.\n\nWhitepaper link:\nhttps://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\n\nA great video for understanding the math behind Bitcoin by 3blue1brown:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4\n\nYou can only inoculate yourself against attacks on the concept if you truly understand where it came from and why, and these two links take just a little under one hour of your time to read and watch and they will help immensely in understanding why so many people think of Bitcoin as money.",

Others who don't want to know about Bitcoin, or Elliptical Curve cryptography will get annoyed with you if you mention it.\n* Avoid alt coins.  They are scams.\n* Enjoy the ride.

I appreciate it.\n\nHave a good day.",

We live all in different economic worlds and judging by your data it is a pretty substantial amount for your situation and economy.\n\nIs it all you have? Than it would be probably wise not to invest it at all. Is it an amount you can effort to see dropping by 50 percent if prices go down like at this very moment? Without panic selling? \n\nThis stuff is not a one way street. A lot depends on your time horizon for the investment. If you think you can get rich in 6 months... Probably investing in crypto is a bad idea. If you say.. OK I invest with a time horizon of minimum 3 to 4 years. Than go ahead and so your research! If you feel comfortable with the bitcoin project at the end it will be your decision.",

If anybody at a loss right now, hence was buying at anytime from here all the way up until 70K.. Happily paid that amount and thought it was a fair price? So obviously they think it\u2019s worth at least that and even more in the future (because that\u2019s what investing is\u00bf) Why would anyone not be happy as hell right now buying at these prices? Nobody shouldn\u2019t be invested in something they don\u2019t have confidence with.. If you have confidence, you should always be buying. Even doubling down in times like these.",

Which of course I maxed out As soon as it was allowed.Well guess what, since BTC is down, it's no longer 10% of my portfolio so today I could buy more.\n\nI'm honestly hoping it keeps dipping so I can keep buying more and eventually will get my entire 401k in BTC in spite of the stupid restriction. Because as it falls, it lets me buy more and more with the other assets in there. The best part is, it's all coming out tax free eventually because it's a 401k. \n\nThat's probably why fidelity only lets you put 10% tbh, some deal they have with the government so we don't make too much tax-free gains.",

How many times has it happened? The last time this happened was 2017. For me this was the largest increase in people buying bitcoin the first time, so when it dropped most of them sold. Which is why bitcoin went from 19k-3k. Even the institutional money that was involved had first time buyers, except they have a lot more money than us and when they  sell it hurts.\n\nAnyway  bitcoin eventually surpassed 19k and we went all the way to 69k with some other drops in between. \n\nBitcoin has had over 69,000 times it\u2019s passed previous all time highs, you\u2019re not unlucky bitcoin dropped in price, this has always happened with bitcoin and will continue to happen before mass adoption \u201c15 years +\u201d.every single time bitcoin crashed like this, it\u2019s blown through the previous ceiling.\n\nThe kids being born today will see 80% of the world owning some sort of crypto.

I\u2019ve been reluctant to help in the midst of a raging bull market. Now that we\u2019ve had a pretty consistent downturn Im willing to start helping them dollar cost average. My parents are fairly anti-tech and don\u2019t even use online banking. Naturally my dad\u2018s reluctant to open a Coinbase account. If I were to buy bitcoin for them and send it to a cold wallet, how would this work down the road if and when they realize profit?\n\nCost basis reporting: since they are buying it effectively OTC from me is it whatever they claim it is? Is it zero? Or what I buy it for and then is there any implications for me? \n\nIn which case Should I just open the coinbase for them and use it as their on-ramp to cold storage if the above cost basis question isn\u2019t advantageous?",

(For those interested, it's because when you spend you have to reveal your public key to the world which ever so slightly weakens protection against things like theoretical QC attacks... reusing an address is still secure as far as we know but why risk it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlus it obfuscates what happened here.  Did they spend 1585.044 coins or did they spend 0.203 coins... in this example it's pretty obvious they were sending 0.203 because it's the smaller amount by some magnitude.",

If we don't look at this, we are inviting regulators to say \"I told you so\" and make things more difficult to \"protect us\"\n\nWe are perfectly capable of better preparing for this by doing diligence in auditing the best we can to those who use it as a reserve asset.\n\nWhat's done is done, but we need to learn and adapt.\n\n1.

Then a series of fud news, the elimination of bans from countries such as China, India, Singapore... led to a rapid decline, but the heat of Fomo made investors inject money further, pulling the price to the top of $69K.\n\nBetween 2020 and now alone, BTC has rallied around 350% from the 20k price area and is now splitting about 2.3x from the top. A lot of top coins split seven times, even there are codes that split a few dozen times, the market is broken and wants to reset, making everyone bewildered and bored. Note this is crowd psychology and success, victory, championship is not for the crowd. Many comments that BTC may fall to the 23k - 24k price range but anyway it is a prediction, but this 28k - 30k price area is also already beautiful. In the end, everything needs a little luck to be successful.\n\nSo what do you think?",

'cache' is a 'store of **value**' and a 'store of value' *can be used as* a medium of exchange (not the other way around)\n\nyou can \"cash out\" an account - like a bank account or an  insurance policy account or your gambling bookie's account or any account where someone takes your money, your cash, your exchangeable boxed-in-value and keeps an account of it and how much they owe you \n\nbut you cannot cash out your btc account \n\nbecause \n\n1. *you* are the person keeping the account of money flow coming in and going out of your account and \n2. actual money recorded in that account *is* the account record of that money \n\nand those two things are inseparable in this form of money\n\nwhat a weird concept \n\nespecially if you have been coached to believe money is something you can either physically hold onto and risk losing or give to someone else to safeguard and keep account of (on your behalf and for a fee)  \n\nthis i believe to be The Most Crucial, fundamentally distinctive concept most people miss about this form of money \n\nthe money and account of that money are both kept by you\n\n it is a sound concept because ... the safeguarding of this money and this account against fraud and theft happens *ab initio* by its very nature - its security is the system itself\n\nand that is its primary value\n\nit is recursive in that sense in that, the value of this money is that it is a safe store and the account of itself \n\nwhich is what makes it valuable, it gives it value\n\nit has secondary and tertiary (and many, many other) values and benefits but the primary thing, the key to its fundamental is that it is safely stored without any question of who watches the watchmen\n\nwho watches the btc watchmen? \n\nE.V.E.R.Y.O.N.E.\n\nwe have the technology now \n\ncase closed. problem solved. age-old question answered \n\nhow? read about it in your own time. there's the sidebar ---> \n\nand whether you personally are able to grok the 'how' of it or not - we are done with the question of who watches the watchmen. for. ever. \n\nhuman kind no longer has to worry about this problem \n\neverything else, told by anyone else, who does not understand this - is just noise \n\nit's just noise \n\nobjective and the purpose of \"sound money\" is outlined by btc \n\neverything else around it - hype, fud, price, everything - it's all just noise \n\nin conclusion, *when* you obtain btc you are, in fact, cashing out - out of a fraudulent accounting system, systematically perpetrated over millennia so much so that it has come to corrupt very idea of money (and conflate it with fraud instead of safe store of value)",

He was a little worried because recently some money were removed from his account and he thought it was just a mistake by the bank. That's why he waited at an ATM to withdraw as soon as I made the transfer. Unfortunately the moment I did the transfer, over 70% of the money were removed. He was devastated, he had no idea what was happening and he really needed that money. After contacting the bank the next day, they informed him that his deceased disabled mother had not paid for the water for 3 years and the debt was automatically transfered to him and seized by the water company,  nothing he could do. They didn't even inform him, no settlements, no questions asked. Automatically confiscated the moment I made the transfer. He was too distressed and I didn't want to lecture him about bitcoin at that moment. But it made it clear to me that it is our only hope for freedom in this unfair system that bails out the rich and strangles the poor.",

And I own a few companies now and focus mostly on client development and employee satisfaction.\n\nI\u2019m making this post as sort of a flashlight on a small point I want to make. A few years ago wallstreet played coy and said \u201cI guess we\u2019ll take a look at their crypto nonsense and trade futures and maybe basket them into an etf.\u201d They essentially played dumb to how transformative this technology is and while doing so slipped under the radar as they established a system fully capable of manipulating the temporary price of crypto (so that they can profit off of both upward and downward swings that they can control). If you\u2019ve ever found yourself wondering why the daily/weekly/monthly charts of almost every single major coin look similar it\u2019s not that retail (you and me) are buying and selling at identical times it\u2019s that our crypto futures have been bundled into ETF\u2019s. Which are essentially a basket full of a select group of securities (selected by them lol). By creating these etfs large institutions gained the ability to control the price of the assets in the basket. And with a limited supply of each coin it\u2019s not a tall order for these multibillion dollar, for profit, companies to manipulate with the use of machine learning algos. \n\nSo without getting too much in the weeds, you\u2019re not seeing a mass sell off (yes some retail are selling obvs but not how it feels). You\u2019re seeing a curated price attack. And this won\u2019t be the last one. And likewise our next bull run won\u2019t be based on positive retail sentiment it will be dictated by them. However the power of crypto comes from the fact that it has the ability to revolutionize our entire planet. And so to that end it will inevitably integrate more and more into society and a higher consolidation price will continue to be achieved. But to get there we must weather the greedy bastardization of price discovery.\n\nHang in there and ffs gtfo of CB.",

The hedge funds see the obvious; Bitcoin is faster and less expensive to use than SWIFT and has an obvious tech advantage. Same story as brick and mortar retail versus Amazon. The more efficient tech wins each time. So they have to figure out how to dominate the space and that's what you see in the price",

But I Am tenacious when I want to get to the bottom of things. The etf scams, and the algos-spot on. Black swan after black swan is not \u201cbank runs\u201d or suddenly panicked retail small wallets. The entire market is only about a trillion right now and 2.5 or so trillion is it\u2019s pinnacle. Black rock alone has nearly 8 trillion in assets under management, and that\u2019s just one of many juggernaut companies that have taken easy money from what they see as sheep to be bled dry. Puts, calls, futures are in my opinion the cancer of stocks- and yes I know why puts can be seen as referees so that stocks don\u2019t go too high and crash the whole system. That\u2019s a cop out, all futures do is give pure leverage to the whales. Sure, it also provides some chum for sharks and some debris for little plankton to make a bit off the utter manipulation, but at tue end of the day the casino lynch pin is futures. Akd the crypto world is pure Wild West , the spoils going to the biggest posse- that posse being the same massive corps that at least have to pretend to be afraid of the SEC in the traditional market.  So, yes, BTC and crypto is not going away- much like any other asset or tech that serves many purposes and appeals to many consumers. And wherever there\u2019s watering holes- so are there crocs, hyenas and so on. It\u2019s pure predation and the massive losses from guppies has a silver lining. Now, all that capital gained for the predators will be even bigger bull waves in the future, my guess at this point is the next halving.",

Let's first get some facts straightened: New York can't stop me from mining wether they ban it or not. Bitcoin is permissionless and doesn't take orders from governments, that goes for mining and transacting. What you're actually talking about are banning large corporate \"crypto\" miners with build-outs into grids with several people in their employ. \n\nAlso, bitcoin people despise the word \"crypto\", a plural term which when used to describe bitcoin, assumes there's some parity between them. There's none. *Crypto* is a scam. \n\nLastly, you're corporate media, which means you have the same problem Mark Zuckerberg does. That can't be fixed until we fix the money. Distortion in money equals distortion in information. When the base layer of finance (fiat/debt) is dishonest, nothing honest can ever be built around it. We aim to replace that base layer with an honest one. We use energy (which can't be counterfeited) to enforce that. The network is 56% renewable today with flexible load which it subsidizes. The baseload is mostly trapped, wasted, and excess, wether that's CTG fossil fuels or nuclear. The network is way ahead of schedule for 99% renewable. So if you plan on fucking whoever you interview with bad lightning, digital color grading, editing, or post hoc talking points that they weren't around to reply to, we'll be waiting to help accelerate the decline of your own corporate network which we'll distribute\n\nP.S. \n\n*If you're from NY we all know what miner we're really talking about here. The shuttered coal plant. You know which one. No bitcoiner likes them. So, they'll often be held up as the example for everyone, folly, like an abortion conversation that rapidly turns to the 0.5% of abortions via rape.*\n\nEdit: the abortion was a bad example. I was trying to say people try to establish a moral high-ground with the most extreme example. Came off quite bad",

The index is 80 and above when it is definitely above that curve.\n\nIf you look back on any chart where you would buy the dip (\"oh man, if only I bought *then*!\"), every time it is below 20 (actually there was a few in the last two years where it was like 22 or 24). This is probably the cheapest you are going to get it. From a cost-benefit-risk analysis it isn't wise to go for the rare event, the rare possibility you can get an even greater discount. It is decision-theoretically less rational.\n\nBUT you might be thinking \"I dunno, maybe it will keep going down by *a lot* more! I don't want my investment to lose value.\" You are right. It might! But this sentiment **reflects** the fear index, rather than **rationally responds** to it. This is where you need to be \"greedy\" when others are fearful, but fearful when others are greedy.\n\nAnyone who is not buying now either has no capital to spare or is an \"emotional\" investor.",

Maybe you joined last year maybe you\u2019re freaking out.\n\nWhy am I still buying bitcoin?\n\nA bit about me, I\u2019m 38, American, and half my net worth is in crypto and the other half is in real estate. Of my crypto, 60% is bitcoin. It will never go below that number either. 50% of additional savings go to bitcoin.\n\nIn 2009 houses plunged. And when the pain was too much, someone gave up and someone bought. And then they plunged further, and in 2010 that same buyer who bought... bought another house.\n\nThe United States government has no way to pay off his debt. We run on deficit spending.\u00a0\n\nThe DXY is 104, The stock market is very shaky, we\u2019re facing a potential world wide recession, and Bitcoin is 29K. Five years ago as a bitcoin approached 10 K people were maniacal and got closer to 15 K people thought they were the new kings. The good investments are things that you don\u2019t touch for five years. And the best Ones are those that you don\u2019t touch for 10 years.\n\nAsk yourself this direct question: do you see the United States and the world having more or less debt due to demographics and technology in 10 years? In a world soaked in debt, how can interest rates actually go up? What has the trend been...Can the trends actually be reversed?\n\nUnlike real estate, which has a slow growing percentage of potential buyers a.k.a. population growth, bitcoin has an exponential group of adopters.\n\nWhen the next stimulus comes, as it has to come because of a slowing economy, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see bitcoin well over 200k. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised for the same people who never bought houses in the last 10 years to continue to say bubble.",

Profit margins reach an equilibrium - the lowest possible margin which is greater than zero  \n\nThe simple effect is that increasing the exchange rate increases the global hash rate  \n\nIncreasing the hash rate temporarily increases the number of blocks mined per day.

HODL, Patience, WAGMI and so on....\n\nI want to go to the second statement because it triggered some thoughts in me for a while that made me decide nowadays that maybe it is only \"half the truth\".\n\nI have often wondered where that statement \"You haven't lost anything until you sell\" came from. The way I see it is projected for the future and not necessarily at the current time.\n\nIt's true that you don't lose anything until you sell but that's only because you haven't realized the loss yet - the same is true for profit and I think you can agree that it's a simple fact.\n\nOne holds on to the hope that in the near future the value will rise again and so one will be in the profit zone. And as we all know, no one knows exactly what the future will look like, even if there are factors that increase the likelihood of making any meaningful predictions.\n\nAdmittedly, this statement was probably made at the time when, for example, new investors with little basic knowledge of the market, panicked and hoped to save their money by selling at a loss for their own compromise, thus avoiding the risk of a total loss. On the other hand, of course, there was someone who, from a psychological point of view, took advantage of this to enrich themselves - one loses, the other wins.\n\nIt's always a balancing act between \"I don't give up hope and believe that it will regain value\" and \"I'm going to make a cut now and invest in other projects and try to make money elsewhere\" - the decision depends on several factors let alone what an investor has to go through psychologically as you could see recently the one particular coin that caused the entire market to plummet.\n\nIt is clear to me that I will never say to anyone that \"you haven't lost anything until you sell\" when the project is at the end and the project cannot go any further steps - reality over illusion.\n\nAlso admittedly, this is an extreme case now, but back in the days of Lehman Brothers would have been the majority said \"you haven't lost anything until you sell\"? They were trying to save themselves. The only voice you heard after a while was yours.\n\nIn the end, the market doesn't really care about how long you hold on to something, but rather where the most profits and losses are made (just my opinion).\n\nI would love to hear your opinions \u2764",

That problem is offering a hedge against a world of CBDCs and total government-controlled money linked to identity and social behaviour.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>This is why I limited my pro-crypto stance to bitcoin alone, comparing myself if anything to a bitcoin maximalist. And my position was pretty clear: as a rule bitcoin serves society best if it exists in the background as a last resort system which never has to be used. This is because it simply cannot compete with the efficiency of a centralised system. The best comparison in my mind is to think of it as a financial \u201cright to bear arms\u201d, which can be funded for the benefit of all by the most diehard enthusiasts who can afford it. I stick with that metaphor today.\n\nShe quit FT and started her own platform \"The Bind Spot\", I wish her success.",

I have often hoped that it would be positive, but there is a dearth of information about it. Which is strange because how could Banksy not comment on such an important financial phenomenon. I think this piece of art gives the answer to that question, and Banksy is likely a silent supporter.",

At this point miner revenue will mostly come from transaction fees.\n\nIf the network demand is low (in terms of ACTIVE users\u2026. We all simply hodl), block fees end up being very low\u2026. Mining profitably will be low. \n\nWe will have less and less revenue for network security as more halvings occur and more hodlers accrue.\n\nSay we\u2019re in a vacuum and it\u2019s 2032. 99% of all bitcoin have already been mined. Everyone in the world is holding bitcoin, but doesn\u2019t spend it or move it because it\u2019s a deflationary asset. Who pays the miners?! Is the cost of attacking the network linearly headed to zero?\n\nVery happy to discuss. I would like to learn what the community thinks about this.",

Like now that the price is down, I care not that my portfolio is down millions in US dollar valuations, because at the same time I\u2019m up even more when you zoom out to when I started to DCA years ago.\n\nSo now I care more that I get to stack more Bitcoin with the fiat that I mine, I care more that I can grow my Bitcoin unites with less dollars. Because once you\u2019ve been in this space long enough, you learn that these dips though they may seem long now, when they\u2019re gone they seem relatively short after they\u2019re no longer available. \n\nPrice ranges you thought you\u2019d have years to swipe at gone because the dollar lost so much value against bitcoin and everything else, the moment anyone decides to take a large loan which mines new dollars into existence devaluating all the rest of our dollars. \n\nYou experience that for enough years, you care more about how many satoshis you get to stack over time than you do how much your satoshis are worth. \n\nZoom out far enough and you\u2019ll find that the price is just zipping away as the dollar loses its value against our satoshis we value and wish to save instead of chronologically worthless debasing dollars\n\n(Infinitely printed fiat currency\u2019s and infinitely produced assets + time) dividend by 21 million Bitcoin",

I was gonna deposit some other altcoins to increase my loan but now I'm debating paying off my loan and leave nexo. I don't really understand how nexo makes money and if they actually need a bull market to survive then I would leave for sure. What u guys think about future of nexo if crypto keeps going down? BTW I havent finished understanding how defi works that's why I signed up for nexo, I know getting loans through defi is better cuz u always own your crypto and also SCAMMERS DONT BOTHER DMing ME I WONT ANSWER.",

That's because the higher a hashrate is, the more difficult and costly it is for someone to attack the network.\n>  \n\n> A good hash rate might indicate that miners are investing money into newer, more powerful mining equipment, which in turn might mean they have confidence in the network.\n> \n> The Bitcoin hash rate is generally considered to be a health signifier for the network\u2014a high hash rate means high processing power is present within the network, which also creates greater security.\n> \n> The security of the Bitcoin blockchain relies upon miners working together to build the same chain, or ledger. As miners validate new blocks, the blocks get added to the Bitcoin blockchain. The longest chain of blocks is always accepted as the valid version.\n> \n> It\u2019s important to have only one ledger, otherwise Bitcoin could, in theory, be duplicated, or spent twice. Double spending can be thought of in this way: If a bank kept two different ledgers of transactions, they could each have different information on them and the same money could be spent multiple times.\n\nhttps://www.sofi.com/learn/content/bitcoin-hash-rate/",

The miners would be limited to human brains and some makeshift mathematical tools to help them do the math. It would be sloppier without good forms of communication though between anyone who is considered a miner in this pen and paper system.\n\nDifficulty would be very low compared to now but scale up to taking a lot of human brain resources to solve blocks, and block times might not be very consistent time-wise. Interesting to think how possible all of that is. But yeah, it is in fact a mathematical discovery that was always possible, but it was the discovery and adoption of the internet and modern communications which made the incentive high enough to take shape and thrive.",

Is it possible for them to buy bitcoins, send them to me, and for me to then sell the bitcoins immediately? Would I lose any money in the process? For example, if they bought $50 worth of bitcoins, would I be able to sell the bitcoins for more or less $50 if we complete the whole process quickly?\n\nAlso, I've heard that some websites like Binance no longer accept Russian cards.

[Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) is good, but shop around. Look at minimum withdrawals and deposits, because that tends to screw people over with small amounts. \n\n[Muun](https://muun.com/) wallet is a simple wallet that I like, which focuses on lightning payments. Lightning is basically instant, so would be the the most efficient (for small payments only). But any wallet would work. Kraken uses lightning too which you'll probably want to use for low fees.\n\nBuying in Russia would definitely be the hardest part. I'm sure it's possible, but you'd have to talk to a Russian probably to get a real idea, I'd only be guessing.\n\nYou might lose money, you might make money.

If I forget something, hopefully other members will add on.\n\n- Bitcoin was the first successful crypto so it has a longer history of working as expected. Hence its trusted more.\n- There were no insiders. Every person had to mine their btc including satoshi himself. Satoshi even waited for other people to mine it before him. This makes it a fair launch.\n- Bitcoin for the first 2 years of its existence had no price. They got distributed during this period and traded freely. None of the other cryptos will ever be able to replicate this thing even if they wanted to.\n- Satoshi left after about 1 year. Every further development was done purely as a open source project without any expectation of profit.\n- Satoshi has not moved his coins ever since he left. And considering that the value of those coins went from 0 to 40 billion, its very likely that satoshi is either dead or has lost access to his coins or intentionally destroyed his keys. So very low probability of rugpull.\n- Bitcoin has had no hardfork. A person in 2012 who was running his node can start up his node again to get up to date with the blockchain. Also bitcoin has never had its chain rolled back.\n- Bitcoin has no marketting, no vc funds. Every user organically comes to bitcoin.\n- Bitcoin has the highest global liquidity on exchanges. That means its by far the easiest to buy or sell large sums of bitcoin for anyone in the world.\n- Bitcoin is the most decentralized with no single point of failure. And every day it gets more and more decentralized with more and more people running nodes.\n- Bitcoin is obtained by proof of work mining, which mimics physical commodity mining. Where a person has to do some work as fast as possible while spending energy (dig the earth in the case of gold) to acquire new units of bitcoin. This ties bitcoin to physical realities in the real world through the use of energy.\n- Bitcoin mining works regardless of where the energy is obtained from. So it lets monetize even the energy that would normally be wasted.\n- Bitcoin issuance schedule or monetary policy has remain unchanged since its inception. And its the one thing that all nodes agree to keep the same. The blocksize wars showed this.\n\nA lot of these things cannot be recreated by any other cryptocurrency. You are seeing bitcoin as just a peer to peer currency. But before that it is something that cannot be diluted by anyone (21 million fixed), its dependable and durable. You can go into a coma and wake up after 10 years to still have the same version of bitcoin out of the 21 million in your wallet.\n\nThese things make bitcoin the perfect candidate for being \"money\". Something that holds its value for as long as you want to without requiring anyones permission to hold or to transact.",

What I personally think was valuable about this attack is that it shows me how antifragile big point is and how the stakeholders that have a perfectly balanced incentive check and balance system: you see everybody that wanted to fork left with BCH and continue to do so until it was comically obvious to its own supporters. Bitcoin retained the community who believed in consensus above all and conservative approaches to updates. I actually supported the big block update but I felt more strongly about maintaining consensus above all. \n\nThe biggest innovation since Bitcoin itself in cryptocurrency space it's not a bunch of shitcoin marketing campaigns year after year (DAOs, NFT, ICO, ETO, etc...) the greatest innovation was making Bitcoin extensible and in doing so the core developers were able to focus on the stability of the network and the security while leaving all of the possible Innovation for people to play on second layer, third layer or side chains.\n\nThis is where I came up with the #BitcoinHydraThesis which I believe comes down to one simple idea that all of this blockchain innovation (and in fact all 21st century finance) is going to be built on top of the most stable, the most secure most decentralized network and that the second best network is meaningless.

This also ensures that no single government / centralised organisation can create more BTC at will and debase / devalue it (which is the reason all fiat currencies in history are bound to fail at some point)\n\nAt the end of the day, money is a belief system and the level of security, trust and global adoption of the Bitcoin network makes it the most robust cryptocurrency to date, even if there are alternatives that proclaim to be cheaper, faster or better.",

Every user organically comes to bitcoin.\n\nWhile it's true that bitcoin is not centralized, there's no VC funding, and there is no single entity in charge of the marketing message, bitcoin is still heavily marketed. Many leading exchanges put ads during the super bowl, for example. Many people have promoted it, and not all of them have been fair portrayals. A lot of users have joined bitcoin without a full understanding of what it was, and particularly during the run-up in 2017 as an example. It's not clear if that's what you mean by organic or not, but a lot of people who bought at the top or didn't know how to securely store their bitcoin lost their funds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think these points take away from any of the others and overall that's a great list.",

Its just word of mouth. People heard about it, they made exchanges, they started advertising it. I meant the marketting came about organically and not because the creator wanted it. Organically means they are not paid to do so by the creator.\n\nAll these things make it a form of property and not a security. Property like land. And any person can buy a piece of land for whatever his motives might be. His neighbors might say that his motives are not the right ones or that he does not understand the land. The guy might decide to just burn the land to the ground. Its not our business what he does with his property. We can only try to help him, but finally its his choice and his property.\n\nSimilarly with bitcoin, any person may buy bitcoin for whatever reason suits them. Number go up, wealth preservation, portability, permissionless, or maybe they wanted to play around with the technology, or build a business around it. Its not upto the others to decide how a bitcoiner should use his bitcoin and why a bitcoiner should buy bitcoin.

I am trying to understand which if any of these bullet points actually mean anything to a \"user\" of Bitcoin in a real world scenario. I mean it sounds like you are spinning the fact that the Blockchain has not evolved is a good thing.\n\n\n- I invite someone on this thread to give me a real life example how you have used Bitcoin in an everyday transaction? How much did you spend, for what, how long did it take and what was the total cost for that transaction.\n\nI am not talking about investing or buying a million dollar Lambo.

Atleast in a developed world we have many ways to transact which are better like credit card for groceries.\n\nIts for the things where conventional transactions are not easy. Ill give a few examples.\n- After I wrote this post, someone liked it and tipped me 500 satoshis. To do the same with dollars, reddit would have had to let us connect our bank account to the reddit app. Thats very difficult for reddit as reddit would have had to get permission in every country to do so. \n- When Ukraine wanted donations for the war, all they had to do was write their bitcoin address on twitter and people were able to send bitcoin instantly to help them. It did not matter what country you were from and how the banking rails were in your country.\n- I hired a dashboard designer in romania to do some work for me. I paid him in bitcoin for the work. I dont know if its even possible to send 5-10 dollars there and what the fees would have been for that.\n- When Andreas Antonopolous was being bullied by Roger Ver, supporters of Andreas worldwide were able to send small amounts of bitcoin to Andreas to make him a millionaire. And no company had to be in the middle to carry these transactions out. \n\nBitcoin is about transfering value between people irrespective of the country they live in, irrespective of the bank they use, irrespective of if their bank is being sanctioned or not. Its like me paying you in gold for something you did. Of course you would still need off ramps to cash it out, but you have the option to keep it as it is.\n\nNow you would say all cryptos can do that. Would you do some work for me if I paid you 10g of copper? No. But you would do it If I sent you the same value in gold. You are more likely to do so, but finally the choice would be yours. Thats the argument with other cryptos. \n\nThe Romanian worker wouldnt have agreed to being paid in dogecoin or some random shitcoin. Alot of the times the money you earn is just saved on not spent. And bitcoin is a great savings tool.\n\nLike being paid in apple stock. Surely you cant use the apple stock to buy groceries. But still people do it. Thats because they expect their apple stock to be worth more in the future. Same with bitcoin. Apple stock is a security here, but Im roughly talking about the practice of \"being paid in kind\".",

It is too slow for hundreds of thousands of users around the world to simultaneously use it to buy groceries, gas, etc., and the transaction fees are too high to purchase low cost items with. Maybe the lighting network will be improved or other layer 2 solutions will be added to permit transactional use.\n\nAs more and more persons join the network, if even governments, cities, corporations join so that the market cap rises to multiples of what it is today, perhaps BTCs volatility will drop enough for it to become the world's stable coin, a global unit of account. Other block chains can serve as the transaction function.\n\nMy speculation.",

It\u2019s about as close to pure decentralization you can get. \n\nBitcoin is the strongest computer network in history, by far. It is orders of magnitude stronger than every supercomputer in the world combined.\n\nBitcoin is not controlled by any person(s) or govt outside of its users themselves; 1 node 1 vote. \n\nBitcoin isn\u2019t the fastest, it isn\u2019t the cheapest, but it\u2019s genesis principles are immutable and have withstood the baptism by fire that is it\u2019s competition, constant attacks, it has resisted politics, and all other human failings of judgment and erroneous creed.

I think one of the big differences between BTC and alt-coins is decentralization. The Bitcoin blockchain is not controlled by any one organization or person.  I don't know of any alt-coin that can claim this.  Some of them do have varying levels of decentralization but none so much as Bitcoin. \n\nWhy is this important? Well, the main reason is that it insulates it from interference from governments, banks, and other influential financial organizations with regard to inflation.  This doesn't mean that the price will not fluctuate.  It just means that the fluctuation will be due to the value of other assets changing relative to bitcoin or sentiment in the market.  \n\nThis is what other posters are referring to when they cite scarcity and decentralization. I am sure others will correct me if I have misspoken.",

This global payment network is the first trustless, increasingly secure, and fully decentralized. Anyone, anywhere can re-validate the entire blockchain by running a node. The fundamental properties were put in motion at the genesis block but the network needed growth for it to succeed. The phenomenon was then that its growth exploded! The network got huge!! \n\nNext, you ask what creates liquidity for this network and what is its unit of exchange? That is the bitcoin. Bitcoin is unique in that the total supply and inflation rate was also cemented from the genesis block. So what you have is an incorruptible unit transacting on the world's largest ever decentralized network. Nobody can screw with it or make changes.\n\nWhy would BTC's value go up? Because when people and instirutions want to transfer money on this new network, it has to have the liquidity. So let's say in ten years, huge institutions regularly transfer billions of dollars, the value of BTC has to be big enough to convert fiat to BTC, then back to fiat, without affecting the price. Or when billions of people use it daily to transact with each other. The price of BTC will have to be high enough so the price doesn't fluctuate.\n\nLastly, you realize other blockchains are not trying to compete with bitcoin. They are not global payment networks with perfect, immutable coins. They are more like open source computer programs. When you invest in them, it's more like you're investing in a startup tech company.\n\nKeep asking questions and researching. Decide what you want to get out of crypto and if it's sound money, that is a long term investment, BTC is the only choice.",

Below I will explain how the NFTs on those altcoin platforms work on a technical level and I will explain why those NFTs probably wont even exist in 10 years. I will also explain why many of these NFTs have sold for such high prices.\n\nMany of those NFTs that were sold for crazy high prices were not actually sold to other people. The person who bought those expensive NFTs is often the same person who minted the NFT in the first place. I will explain how whales can easily own very expensive rare NFTs for very little cost. They can just mint an NFT and sell it to them self for $500,000 worth of ETH. They will only lose the small percentage that the NFT marketplace takes and now they own a super rare NFT worth $500k and they will still have most of their ETH because they sold the NFT to them self. And there is a small chance that they might be able to to sell that worthless NFT to some fool who believes that it is actually valuable. Doing this also entices more newbies to mint NFTs in the hopes of getting rich.\n\nSome people are now using flash loans to borrow large amounts of ETH so that they can purchase their own NFTs for extremely high prices and then they pay back the flash loan all in the same block. https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/122516/how-a-cunning-trick-made-it-look-like-a-cryptopunk-sold-for-532-million\n\nHere is another example that can be done. You can mint an NFT and sell it to yourself for $1000, then put it up for sale and buy it from yourself again for $1500, and sell it to yourself another time for $2200. Now you can put this appreciating NFT up for sale and try to sell it to some fool who sees it keeps getting sold for more and thinks that it must be valuable.\n\nHave you seen celebrities buying NFTs like jpegs of bored apes for hundreds of thousands of dollars? Platforms like MoonPay are paying those celebrities to claim that they bought those NFTs. Those celebrities didn't really pay anything for those NFTs. Those celebrities actually got paid for receiving those NFTs. You can often look at the blockchain and see that the ETH that was used to buy the NFT came directly from a platform like MoonPay, as is the case with the bored ape NFTs that Post Malone recently \"bought for $700k+\". DaBaby, Future, other celebrities and and professional athletes were also paid to pretend like they bought bored ape NFTs. It's advertising and hyping people up making them think these NFTs are really valuable. MoonPay even paid for a 7 second clip of Post Malone pretending to purchase a bored ape to be included in his recent music video. Here is that music video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc0tLGWIqxA&t=12s\n\nhttps://boardroom.tv/bored-ape-nft-celebrity-owners/\n\nhttps://nftnow.com/lists/celebrities-who-have-bored-ape-yacht-club-nfts/\n\nhttps://www.benzinga.com/money/celebrities-that-own-bored-ape-yacht-club-nfts/\n\nhttps://decrypt.co/79953/nba-nfl-mlb-stars-ethereum-nft-bored-ape-yacht-club-cryptopunks\n\nThe current NFTs are useful for something. These NFTs are a useful tool for laundering illegally acquired cryptocurrency. Criminals can shift around their ill gotten crypto between different tokens, mint an NFT, and purchase their own NFT with their dirty crypto. Now they've cleaned their dirty crypto and they also own a rare NFT that's supposedly worth a lot of money. I mean, just look at how much it sold for!\n\nIt costs anywhere from $100-$600+ to mint an NFT on Ethereum depending on the current gas fees and where you mint it. So they're [hyping shitcoiners/artists/anyone up and luring them into minting crap in the hopes of getting rich](https://fstoppers.com/opinion/nfts-are-pyramid-scheme-and-people-are-already-losing-money-554869) and NFTs are doing a great job of that at the moment. People are spending millions of dollars worth of Ethereum minting NFTs hoping to hit the NFT lottery and get rich.\n\n**All these NFT tokens being sold on Ethereum right now either point to a URL on the internet, or an IPFS hash. In most circumstances they reference an IPFS gateway on the internet run by the same startup that sold the NFT. That URL also isn't the media. That URL is a JSON metadata file.** The owners of the servers have no obligation to continue storing the media. Now let's take a look at a couple of real NFTs and see how they work on a technical level.\n\nhttps://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/1\n\nThis NFT token is for this JSON file hosted directly on Nifty's servers as shown below: https://api.niftygateway.com/beeple/100010001/\n\nThat file refers to the actual media that was \"bought.\" Which in this case is hosted by Cloudinary CDN, which is served by Nifty's servers again. So if Nifty goes bust, this token is now worthless. It refers to nothing and this can't be changed. \n\nNow we'll take a look at the $69,346,250 Beeple, sold by Christies. It's so expensive. Surely it isn't centralized, right? Wrong, it's pointless: https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924\n\nThat NFT token refers directly to an IPFS hash. We can take that IPFS hash and fetch the JSON metadata using a public gateway: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz\n\nSo well done for referring to IPFS, it references the specific file rather than a URL that might break! **But** the metadata links to: https://ipfsgateway.makersplace.com/ipfs/QmXkxpwAHCtDXbbZHUwqtFucG1RMS6T87vi1CdvadfL7qA\n\nThis is an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com, the same NFT minting startup which will go bust one day.\n\nYou might say \"*just refer to the IPFS hash in both places!*\" But IPFS only serves files as long as a node in the IPFS network **intentionally** keeps hosting it. Which means when the startup who sold you the NFT goes bust, the files will probably vanish from IPFS too. [This is already happening.](https://twitter.com/CheckMyNFT/status/1371960028765245440) There are already [NFTs with IPFS resources that are no longer hosted anywhere.](https://twitter.com/scanlime/status/1371509988179464196)\n\nAnd just pinning the file on your own IPFS node also wont work because the metadata file generally points to a specific HTTP IPFS gateway URL and not the IPFS hash. This means that when the gateway operator goes bust, I can buy the domain and start serving dick pics lol\n\nRight now NFT's are built on an absolute house of cards constructed by the people selling them, and it is likely that every NFT sold on Ethereum so far will be broken within a decade. This creates a pretty solid exit plan for makersplace if they run into financial problems. The people who own the these useless NFTs \"worth\" millions of dollars are going to be pretty motivated to buy the site or fund it. Or someone can buy the bankrupt startup domains and start charging NFT owners to serve their files.",

Depends on too many variables. Make your business case.\n\nI\u2019m sure Musk\u2019s businesses own their offices when it makes sense for them.

Oddly enough, people are different. \n\nI'd rather deal with repairs and maintenance my way rather than the shoddy work I experienced as a renter. I also enjoy doing the maintenance, so it's not a chore for me. Others may disagree. \n\nAs a landlord, I can assure you that you're paying for repairs as a renter.  It's just amortized; I am not loosing money as a landlord.  That can be a less stressful way to go for some people.  I get it.  It's not for me, but I can understand it; there's no sudden hit to your savings.  \n\nI enjoy modifying the house any way I want, too.  Sometimes in odd ways that are very specific to my needs and wants; I have a music room that I added on to the house that has shag carpet on the floor.  And walls.  And ceiling.  It's awesome.  For me.  Not something everyone will like, and not something that could have been done in a rental.\n\ntl;dr there are pros and cons to each, and every person must weigh those out based on their own needs, wants, and desires.  There is no universal right answer for every person. \n\nExcept for \"rent to own\".  Run away from that bullshit!   Just like shitcoins, those are scams!",

I had a neighbor that bought a house that had no business doing so.  He hated every minute of it and wasn't happy.  He looked like a pissed of Yosemite Sam just mowing the lawn!  I suggested to him many times to sell and get into a condo.  After 4 years he did, and was much happier after doing so. \n\nEven as I type this I'm looking forward to mowing the lawn and having a cold beer afterwards while playing with the dog.  I love that shit!\n\nThe housing decision is just like every other decision in life. If you know who you are, and what you want, the best decsion is the one that meets your needs, wants, and desires specific to you.  There were times where renting was the right thing for me and I'm glad I did then.  I still hated living in \"someone else's place,\" but the trade off was worth it at the time. \n\nI'm scincerely glad that you live in a way that suits you!

You'll find that taxes, repairs, special assessments, insurance, and a mortgage add up quickly. And now rates are rapidly rising. \n\nYou buy more bitcoin. The house will depreciate over time against its deflation. You'll be sitting in your new 30  year debt sentence miserable. In 2019 I convinced a friend to buy the house with $50k down payment instead of BTC. He had twins on the way and family business nearby. The neighborhood was in a full upswing, $10T hadn't been printed, and in the end, his house doubled from 450k to 900k. It outperformed BTC for what he invested. He sold it, pocketed the original 50 and is now renting. The profit is going into miners (MARA, RIOR, CORZ) and BTC.",

                    "response": "This is something I actually know a little about.  \nSo long so here is the TLDR: I would prefer to continuously buy btc than buying a house right now. I\u2019m bullish on both because I think there are similarly the same bet of Continuous money printing and lower interest rates.  \nHousing is all about leverage.  \nFor example, if you put down 20% you\u2019re 5x leveraged.  \nPut down 10%, your 10x leverage.  \nPut down 5%, your 20x leveraged.  \nThis means that if you put down 20% if the house equity goes up 5%, your return on investment relative to your down payment is 25%. However, if you put down 5%, and the house goes up 5%, Your return relative to your down payment is 100%. However, if you put down 5%, and the house goes down 5%, your return on your investment relative to your down payment is -100%.  \nSo, would it be better to put your money into a house with a loan or to bitcoin?  \nWell, The way people make a lot of money on housing is to do max leverage and have the idea that the house goes up. That\u2019s the way to make a lot of money. For example, 5% down, if the house goes up 50%, that\u2019s 10x  \nOr 1,000% relative to your down payment.  \nThat would be great.  \nHowever, how can House pieces go up 50%?  \n1. Supply/demand -This would be a specific area that you think has a huge potential.  \n2. Growing population. Most likely, this is not happening. The US population for example is growing .6%...in 1960s growing 1.4%. You have to seek out number one, a specific city with large Potential growth/demand.  \n3. The increase of money supply and or the decrease in interest rates. I think this is completely possible and probable...However, you then have to estimate what you think will happen to bitcoin in this environment, because that\u2019s what I believe bitcoin needs to go into it\u2019s next bull market.  \nIf you think bitcoin would 10x, that\u2019s actually the same as a house with 5% down payment going up 50% . For example, if you bought a 500 K house with 25K down and the house Went up 50%, the equity gain is 250 K. 250 K relative to 25K down payment is 10X on your money.  \nBut, it\u2019s more complicated. Why? Well, first off, if it\u2019s your own home, instead of paying rent to the landlord, you\u2019re paying interest to the bank. The question is does the interest exceed what the rent is? Also, you are getting attacked advantage typically by owning, not renting. But on the flipside, you have to pay property taxes, insurance, and repairs. You have less flexibility to move or take advantage of opportunities. However, your rent is somewhat fixed when you are paying a fixed loan to the bank. As many have discovered this past year, rent can go up significantly.  \nSo after all that, here\u2019s the real question: Will housing prices keep going up? And unless it\u2019s in a specific city, I believe the technological revolution will soon drive the cost of houses down significantly. I\u2019m talking about 3d printed houses. So, what else can make housing keep going up? The money printer and reduced interest rates.  \nAnd that is what will keep bitcoin going.  \nIf I was under 40 and didn\u2019t own a home, I would rather buy bitcoin then home. Because I believe bitcoin is on its way to 500 K and ultimately 1 million. And then bear markets I can continuously add to my stack, I don\u2019t need to get a bank loan approval to do so...And they\u2019re already loans where you can get I\u2019m mortgage using bitcoin as collateral. However, these longer require 100% of the house are you in bitcoin. But I think it\u2019s completely possible that within five years that goes down to 50% and so on.",

                    "response": "Example: the blockchain when creating the next block requires us to solve for a number that can fit the transaction block hash (header). Here is the block hash for the latest Bitcoin block: 00000000000000000000664d48a530c8a9047ae31f6ba81ff5c49c22072d4536. The last 32 digits are the block hash and the digits before them present the details (in a compressed hash format) of the transactions in that block. Nobody knows that number (before the block is solved) but we all have to solve for it. Let\u2019s say we know the number is a simple 2 digit number in the range of 30-50 (for simplicity but the real number is 32 digits). We try every number going from 30-31-32-33\u2013\u2026\u2026-49-50. Let\u2019s say 42 was the correct solution to fit the block hash. The first one to 42 gets the correct one wins the block and gets to earn fees from the transactions.. \n\nWhen you (the miner) find 42, you shout it out to other miners who hear 42. They can easily verify that 42 fits into the last 2 (in reality 32 digits) digits of the block hash to complete it. It\u2019s like solving a math problem - if I give you 250 and 5, you know the solution is 50 (50x5 = 250). That\u2019s how other miners VERIFY that the hash number you found is correct. They just need to make sure that 42 fits in the hash, which is very easy but FINDING THAT 42 is VERY HARD! The miner who correctly found 42 did the hard work of finding 42, hence winning the block. \n\nIn reality, the number is like 32 digits so it\u2019s impossible to imagine, but I hope this explanation helps conceptualize it.\n\n\nCan someone please correct me and let me know if my explanation is alright? It\u2019s for a very non-technical class. I\u2019ve overly simplified and left out some details regarding nonces, links to previous blocks, etc.",

Like it or not, the regulations will give institutions and corporations the clarity they require before being permitted to deploy capital on their balance sheets. The GAAP/IFRS accounting changes will remove the unfavorable permanent impairment loss. Lightning projects will create the global transaction utility component to actually use BTC. Interesting point on this, the Ex-Meta (Facebook) chief crypto executive just launched a new company advancing lightning protocols for payments. Lastly, after regulations we're going to see the approval of a spot ETF. Most likely the GBTC as the first to convert. This will open up the channels for tons of money on the sidelines desiring BTC on a traditional platform in a traditional investment vehicle. \n\nBTC is the only blockchain that is designed for the global ecosystem. It's all we need for what most crypto enthusiasts desire. Hold your BTC and DCA, you're the entrepreneurial investors. \n\nKeep hope and see you at $100k!",

Headway and updates to code as well as things like the lightning network have brought the energy consumption down. And a lot of large companies that also mine bitcoin use extra energy from their industry. For example in Alberta there's a guy who runs an oil drilling operation and has excess energy wasted in heat, he collects the heat and transfers it into usable energy to power the mining rigs. This guy is either a shill against bitcoin or really doesn't understand anything past 2010.",

There are over 6,000 of these same industrial buildings across the country. And many many more around the world. Yet no one bats an eye. I'm not saying that it's right. It isn't, but I laugh at how often these academics attack bitcoin while ignoring the rest of the wasted energy around the world",

You can use it for everything: You think Chicago's homicide rate is bad, look at St. Louis!\" But Chicago's homicide rate IS pretty high so it's still a problem...\n\nBTC does have a bit of an environmental PR problem, and it's grounded in fact.

If bitcoin reaches wider and wider adoption things likely with have to change, unless it changes goals as a store of wealth with code running over top for cheap and fast payments with the network only transferring large sums at a time. Who knows how the system will evolve.\n\nI'm not arguing that it's perfect or not a problem, just that it appears to recieve a brunt of the bad rep on energy consumption when compared to other industries and practices.\n\nI'll drop a few links here related to energy consumption and the lightning network as one attempt to fix that which works quite well. And of course as time goes we may end up with far better ways to lower energy usage.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.paymentsjournal.com/the-lightning-network-what-is-it-and-what-are-the-benefits/amp/\n\n\n\nhttps://hbr.org/2021/05/how-much-energy-does-bitcoin-actually-consume\n\nEdit: I should add I'm no expert and know that, and definitely believe there's flaws that need to be hashed out and I don't necessarily believe bitcoin will be the answer to the fiat problem. How often does the first or anything end up being the best, safest, most cost effective or most successful? But these arguments against it always feel so black and white. Such as \"all crypto need to burn in a fire\" rather than suggestions on how to do better or compromise. If the world announced tomorrow it was going back to gold standard I'd be all for it.",

For example after next halving when bitcoin is playing with $100,000- $200,000 and after two years(halfway through to the next halving) it dips way back down to$70,000, it's only guys like you that blame it on inflation,  staggering markets,  depreciating dollar,  etc. This is because your not a DEV, you have never mined bitcoin and you don't really understand crypto at all. You only hear things on the news or read bunk articles. Sheep leading sheep.  You will only learn if you have the ability to listen.  Bitcoin is extremely predictable if you learn the history and how to read charts.  The cycles are so simple my friend.  Just go look for yourself.  I promise you'll be amazed!",

I walked her through a number of options. She did a decent amount of personal research on equities, Sov wealth, index funds.. Decently diversified.\n\n$40K worth, she put into Bitcoin. I'd warned her to ignore other hustle coins. This was fall of 2020. She learned a great lesson. That Bitcoin's patterns are predictable, around the peak the next year, she sold off a decent chunk, had me help her build 6 mining rigs.\n\nThe lesson or moral of the story? Bitcoin is predictable, it's only very remotely related to usual investment products, and in spite of some drawbacks to the environment, etc., it's just working through it's pattern, same as it always does.\n\nThere is a reason you hear this refrain again and again. My friend Rebecca sure was happy as fuck that she listened and really took time to learn crypto from crypto ppl, not trade market analysts and talking heads on TV.\n\nThe end \ud83d\ude1b",

Demand and spending are artificially high. Our economy has been on crack for 2 years. The market has been trying to grow like crazy to feed increased demand and fight shortages. \n\n What happens when demand normalizes? Lay offs. What do lay offs cause? Less spending. What happens when the crazy inflation becomes a reality in the minds of regular people? Less spending. What happens when it's evident to everyone that there's an economic crisis that the fed cannot bail us out of? Even less spending.\n\n\nSo we may disagree on us currently being in a recession. I don't think one is avoidable. I do however think we are in one now, though I can't prove that to you or anyone. This has never happened before.

Hopefully that paradigm will change in the future but we clearly are not there yet.  At this point, it is much more accurate to say that Bitcoin most clearly mirrors technology stocks (ie Nasdaq) which explains why it has crashed along with Nasdaq.  Now you did bring up money printing and I definitely would agree their is a correlation (both Nasdaq and BTC benefitted GREATLY from money printer go brrrrr policies).  But the drawback of that is that as soon as the money printer was turned off, BTC crashed right along with the Nasdaq.  Hard to really say what BTC is worth when it has that kind of volatility.  BUT, I can promise you WHEN the money printer goes brrrr again I will be throwing every penny I get into BTC (just as I am DCAing now at 30k).",

I'm talking about long term hodlers.\n\nI've written about this before, but it's worth repeating:\n\nIn 2011 (a year before the first halving), owning a hundred Bitcoin was nothing. Most sold it as soon as it was worth anything, and they're gone now.\n\nIn 2015 (a year before the second halving), owning ten Bitcoin was no big deal. Most sold it and are gone now.\n\nIn 2019 (a year before the third halving), owning one Bitcoin wasn't that big of a deal. How many 1 BTC hodlers from 2019 still have that much today? Most will panic sell. Many already have.\n\nNOT ME.\n\nThis is a once in a generation opportunity to be part of something big. It might be fair to say it's a once in a lifetime opportunity. Don't eff it up.\n\nFor anybody reading this who's scared, here's my advice: Move your coins to a hardware wallet. Secure your seed phrase and walk away for three years. That'll put you one year after the next halving, which means it will be in the heart of the next big bull run. When you come back in 2025, your investment will be worth so much more than the price you're panicking about today, and all of the old bears who sold will be wishing they were you, still sitting on your stack intact as Bitcoin soars to new highs only dreamt of during the previous cycle.\n\nKEEP CALM    \nAND    \nHODL ON",

Nothing foundational about bitcoin or blockchain has been found to fail or be sketchy, there has not been some big governmental intrusion to kill the space.

Juxtaposed against a hard currency with fixed supply, i really think this dip, however big it may become, presents a fantastic opportunity to come out the other side with tremendous gains.",

And there's no guarantee that all of them (or even any of them) will recover back to ATH's or beyond (in fact most of them probably won't).\n\nHappens all the time with company stock prices, when a company is flying high and some bad news or change in their market causes stock price to take a huge hit. Maybe the company doesn't go bankrupt, but it's not at all unusual for stock price to stay at a fraction of ATH and never recover.\n\nDCA and \"buying the dip\" usually works well when investing in mature **markets** (such as  stock index funds/ETF's), but I think a lot of people are in denial about just how much risk this approach can have for individual investments. At some point, \"buying the dip\" becomes \"sunk cost fallacy\".",

And let me tell you if you had been one of the first to accumulate gold before it became the main store ot value you'd be very rich.\n\nIn Bitcoin you have to be in for the long run and it needs to be binary. Either it succeeds and its value rises exponentially. Or it doesn't for some reason and you'll have a very mediocre result or lose all.\n\nBut if it does, did it matter if you bought Microsoft at 2 cents or at 5 cents?\n\nThe question you have to ask yourself is where I see Bitcoin i 5 years if the inflationary environment continues, and if it becomes one of the preferred ways to protect liquidity from inflation for a significant part of the population.\n\nIf you believe in this scenario just buy. At 30k at 20k at 40k, doesn't matter.\n\nIf you don't believe in it, just stay away.",

My God, this isn't unpredictable, it isn't remotely worrisome. It's continuing the same rough pattern it's followed for a decade now. It's the process doing it's thing. \n\nSure, some panicked sellers will stupidly take a loss and drive prices down further temporarily. They'll lose their ass, and other ppl will invest during the trough. A half year later, value will spike, rinse and repeat.\n\nFolks, Bitcoin backs too many different ACTUAL traded market products now. It's being taken on as national currency in some countries with more considering it. It isn't going anywhere. \n\nI think the amount of info about Bitcoin value, history, etc. gets ppl obsessively checking on it. First rule of investment... Put your money in, and then forget about it for a while. If you don't sell during a value trough, what's the worry?",

The first time I heard about bitcoin I was a 12y/o kid who had just heard about the deep web and how Bitcoin was used to pay for assassinations and drugs and child porn and so on\u2026\nFast forwad to 2018 I thought about buying but Bitcoin had already hit 17k (euros) and was at the time at 6 or 7k. I thought to myself \u201cIt dropped from 17k to 6k, that\u2019s no good, besides, 7k is still too much\u201d. Then it dropped to 3k and 2k and I  kind of lost interest, and now I regret not buying and Hodling at the time. However today I can see why Bitcoin is and will always be the number one cryptocurrency. I bought my first satoshi at 39k, I bought more earlier today at 29k and will continue buying every month and Hodl it for a very long long time.\nThank you for reading.",

It was 250 300 bucks at the time. When I went to visit family for Thanksgiving this past November my stepdad pulled me to the side and said he remembers that conversation like it was yesterday, and apologized. I am 21 now, would love to have taken the opportunity then - but my thoughts and opinions haven't changed about bitcoin.

However, you could also read this as *bad* for bitcoin, as it encourages holding and not spending, which makes it less likely to succeed as a currency where people receive it and then spend it. This is in effect a defensive wall they are putting up to defend the Euro in the future from an attack by *any* crypto.",
