The economy is worse off when we start printing. Just look back in history, when currencies had the goldstandard the countries were booming, once they started printing they all went to shit and big down the line and big world powers fell because of this.\n\nKeynesian economics is baaaaad\n\nThe printing of money will be the reason the US will fall, like many countries before it, just watch and see. Printing money is a terrible thing that always leads to disaster.\n\nIn society were bitcoin is the currency, there is a fixed value. People can\u2019t produce more of it. The only way to get more Bitcoin is to go out and work for it. No one is going to artificially inflate the economy by pumping more money into it. People will become less lazy and will start to work harder and be more innovative, unemployment rate will also go down most likely towards 0%",

So if they want to loan you money they need to have gold in the bank for it because they can\u2019t go out and print new bills that are not pegged to gold. Now banks can just type some extra zeros in their computer basically and you get money and they just made some extra bills.\n\nBut we can\u2019t just go randomly to a economy based on gold or Bitcoin. First the US will die and after that there will be a gold or maybe a Bitcoin standard. If you go to it without the death of the US economy it would crash the economy we know I think because everything we see now is artificially inflated and kept alive",

This means military industrial complexes crack leaking all their time, money, and energy back to society in a wealth distribution at odds with robbing Jeff Bezos to give his money to people that will give it right back to him. It demonetizes the political class in a way that eliminates symbolic legislation and force ideas of value.\n\n*Are you ok with this?*\n\nNo more high-rises overlooking Central Park with 100% ownership and 5% occupation.

            "selftext": "Sometimes I've been talking with people about bitcoin. Some people seemed to like it. I was able to help some people to set up wallets and buy a little bitcoin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut at least in my experience, it seemed like most people had negative opinions about bitcoin. If they don't want bitcoin, that's ok too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs part of my bitcoin learning experience over the years, it occurred to me that it would probably be good to see the negative criticism about it, so I can be sure if bitcoin really works or if maybe people found any real problems with it. But at this point, I basically see people just guessing what must be wrong with bitcoin, or repeating some FUD talking points without real basis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are a few things that people told me about bitcoin. Maybe it's just me, but sometimes I find those statements interesting / amusing. They were all said by Brazilian people unless noted otherwise. I've heard most of them in Brazilian Portuguese (which is the main language here in Brazil) so I'm translating them to English now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost asked question by far:\n\n\"Once you buy bitcoin, how do you withdraw the money later?\" (I usually talk about bitcoin ATMs, and also suggest waiting months / years before withdrawing. I also suggest spending fiat money before spending any bitcoin.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNegative reactions said by other people:\n\n\"It has gained much value over the years, so it must be a pyramid scheme.\"\n\n\"It has lost value or it has gained value too slowly (depending on time frame), so it must be a waste of time / or it must be the wrong cryptocurrency.\"\n\n\"The owner / inventor of bitcoin was arrested.\" (referring to a guy here in Brazil who was basically accused of losing people's money with bitcoin, he's nicknamed \"Pharaoh of Bitcoins\" around here)\n\n\"People lose money with bitcoin all the time.\" (To be fair, I suppose some people lose money with bitcoin sometimes, like when they buy high and sell low. Or in that \"Pharaoh of Bitcoins\" case)\n\n\"Bitcoin is not real money because you can't hold it in your hand. Cash and credit cards count as real money, because you can hold them.\"\n\n\"You must be rich to have bitcoin.\" / \"It's too expensive, other cryptocurrencies are better because they are cheaper.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin is going to end, China is banning it.\"\n\n\"You should act more responsibly with your money instead of buying bitcoin. You don't know if this is going to work out.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin is probably for criminals because it's sketchy to have a currency without government oversight.\" (I've heard this in English, not from Brazil)\n\n\"Something only has value because people believe it has value. Maybe eventually people will believe that bitcoin is worth $0, then it really will be worth $0.\" (I've heard this in English, not from Brazil)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes people did not seem to believe me about some bitcoin claims:\n\n\"If someone loses their password, there's no way the money just stands there in their account with no way to retrieve it. That can't be right.\"\n\n\"It does not make sense that you hold onto bitcoin and it becomes more valuable over time. Who is giving you that additional money? Money does not grow on trees.\"\n\n\"I don't see how bitcoin could still have value if it gets banned in a number of countries / governments.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther misconceptions / questions said by other people:\n\n\"The price is rising or is declining, so that's the price that the bitcoin management wants.\"\n\n\"Do the bitcoin send you a debit/credit card?\"\n\n\"You can deposit / withdraw whenever you want? Don't they make you wait for some time before withdrawing it?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople finding out about alt coins:\n\n\"If China bans bitcoin and creates their own cryptocurrency, China's cryptocurrency will probably be worth more than bitcoin.\"\n\n\"After you told me about bitcoin, I did my own research and would like to buy these cryptocurrencies: (says a list).\"\n\n\"Since bitcoin is backed by nothing and got very valuable over the years, I want to make my own coin so it will also get very valuable.\"",

The \"if they don't want bitcoin, that's ok\" is very important.  \nNot everyone is into taking investment risks.

You can't convince someone in one go who has no knowledge. Tell them why their concern isn't valid, and why you think bitcoin is a good idea. Not as an investment, but the technology, the impact on the world, the exit from the current monetary system. They should do their own research to find out if your claims are correct.",
