Any gains they have claimed do not exist, and any money you have sent it gone. You need to contact law enforcement in your country, but you are unlikely to see any of that money back, sorry.\n\nDo not accept any help from people in DMs who claim they can help you recover your funds; they are scammers and will only steal more from you.\n\nedit: Amount of claimed returns is impossible, amount of claimed investment funds is laughable. English across the site is very bad. Social links go nowhere.",
