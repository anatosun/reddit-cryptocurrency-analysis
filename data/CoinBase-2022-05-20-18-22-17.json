When you use a bank account to purchase cryptocurrency or cash in local currency to Coinbase, we provide these funds or crypto immediately in your Wallet, which allows you to buy, sell, and trade immediately in your Coinbase and Coinbase Pro account.\n\nHowever, you will be unable to immediately cash out or send the cash value of this transaction out of your Coinbase and Coinbase Pro account - this includes transferring between your Coinbase and Pro wallets. This is a critical security feature that we cannot remove from your account. Once you can cash out, you will be able to transfer between Coinbase and Coinbase Pro.\n\nTo learn more about why funds could be on hold, then please see \u2014 https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/sending-or-receiving-cryptocurrency/available-balance-faq. Do let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.",
