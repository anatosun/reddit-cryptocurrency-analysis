In contrast the girl with the bitcoin glasses can see it all and she\u2019s not alone. It\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows, these glasses aren\u2019t rose tinted, they allow the wearer to experience reality.\n\nExperiencing the world through these glasses reveals corruption and lies, It\u2019s not all bad though, being able to see the world for how it is allows the wearer to take back control and free themselves from fiat slavery.",
