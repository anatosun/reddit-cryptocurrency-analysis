I\u2019m new to all of this and was a little shocked that for 500USD I\u2019m getting 400USD worth of BTC.\nThe best part is that the seller issued an invoice for 522USD, so I lost 122USD.\nPlus I have heard that to send it to another wallet it will take 15USD minimum for the transaction (Paxful fee and miners fee?)\nCan someone explain me this?\nThank you in advance for your time.",
