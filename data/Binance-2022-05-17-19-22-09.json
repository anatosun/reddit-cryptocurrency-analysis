However, my old binance account is only deactivated (since Binance does not allow deleting anymore). Now, there are some few restrictions on creating new accounts, especially in the verification process. what is the solution?\n\nBy the way, My old account was worth Zero. Can I somehow ask binance to delete it for I can create a fresh one?\n\nfor the question of why I didn't preserve my old binance account: I was very frustrated with some issues and services there (It was few months ago). Now, I reconsidered stuff.\n\nThanks for the answer in Advance :)",
