            "selftext": "Following the latest drama with UST and other stablecoins, USDT has seen a sizeable reduction in its overall circulating supply.\n\nTether, the company behind the largest stablecoin by market capitalization USDT, has seen a reduction in the asset\u2019s circulating supply after investors withdrew over $7 billion from it.\n\nThe development came shortly after USDT briefly lost its peg to the US dollar on some exchanges, dropping to $0.96 in the wake of the Terra UST saga. Although USDT has regained its dollar parity on trading platforms, investors seemed to have lost some confidence following a withdrawal of $7 billion from the stablecoin.\n\nTether\u2019s stablecoin reserve has come under criticism, with arguments as to whether USDT is indeed backed 1:1 to the US dollar. However, it is very important to note that Tether\u2019s CTO confirmed on multiple occasions that the company backing USDT \u2013 Tether \u2013 continued redeeming the stablecoin at its value ($1), meaning that the peg remained unfazed.\n\nWhat is your opinion on this situation? Did you lose confidence in [USDT](https://swapzone.io/currencies/tether)?\n\n[Source: news.bitcoin.com](https://preview.redd.it/5cl9i3whs8091.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=161bdad7db364933b2dc756dfd40d6cab1e01b7c)",

I suspect that if there\u2019s a \u201crun on the bank\u201d there\u2019s going to be a point where they simply won\u2019t be able to redeem USDT for USD, and then the price will crash. Like traditional banking - it\u2019s all built on confidence, and once this goes it will collapse like a house of cards, unless they really are holding piles of cash.\n\nWhat\u2019s the utility of holding USDT versus another stable coin or even USD?\n\nThere\u2019s only downside to being long USDT, so I guess people are moving out of it.",
