I do not know if this has something to do with it.",

Also, can you please sign out of the app then sign back in and see whether you are still being prompted to use 2FA?\n\nYou should be able to shift with 2FA to TOTP anytime and this should also take effect immediately. If in any case the above steps do not work for you, please raise a support case and let us know the case number so we can follow through - https://help.coinbase.com/en/contact-us.\n\nHere's also an added reference on the security options you can choose from: https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/managing-my-account/get-back-into-my-account/2-step-verification-troubleshooting?ref=ha.",
