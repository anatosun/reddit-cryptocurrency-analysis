            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am writing this to inform each and every EU newcomer to the Coinbase card, especially the ones that come from [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) like me, after the rewards being slashed. \n\nThe entire situation began after my Coinbase card arrived and I activated it. I was then missing some of the main features like topping up the card, choosing whether to receive my cashback as Bitcoin or XLM and etc. After almost a week of me sending emails, screen recordings and screenshots to the support, they finally reached out to admit that the EU card offers 0% cashback. Literally nothing at all.\n\nI am deeply disappointed, as the 4% cashback rewards is why I ordered the card initially. Furthermore, it wasn't mentioned anywhere at all that EU gets no cashback rewards. The response I got is \"We are working on bringing this feature in the near future\". Okay, please mention it somewhere before I waste my time ordering this piece of plastic with 0 benefits to me right now.",
