The minimum amount is usually $100 000, but you can negotiate lower purchases. I recommend Kraken Pro, their daily withdrawal limit is 10 000 000$ (or crypto equivalent) and BTC is really fast in your private wallet. \n\nHowever, buying 100k in BTC usually doesn't require OTC, there is more than enough liquidity in spot trading, just do the maximum KYC for higher withdrawal limits. \n\nIf you actually talk about 10 000-100 000 BTC don't bother, this is something to talk with banks and exchanges BEFORE.",
