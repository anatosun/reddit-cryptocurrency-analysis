That's it.\nIf all known millionaire's equally distribute it, each get only 0.33.\nAll those crazy stats. \nIncreasing complexity of hash function....what not! But..\n\nIt looks like its trying to stabilize at 26-31k range.\n\nBut today, I had a thought to push my savings and take loan (about 15k $) and buy 1 entire bitcoin. After all, in that scarcity, an integer would be paramount considering 1 satoshi is 10 to -8 bitcoin.  \n\nBut...if I catch this thought myself, I am sure many would. \nAtleast 20 million working people would...\n\nI have seen trading for 8 years now so I am just afraid of retail FOmOing into this heavy support at 27k...nobody will get out till fall to 15k. Then some weak hands will fall with fall to 11k. Then a bounce till 18k-21k...height of FOMO. Then at 6-8k fall will make more weak hands falls. I suspect this can continue till 800$-2000$ per bitcoin. \n\nBut as of now this process surely look to continue till 8xxx is seen on bitcoin. \n\nAll.and.every.thought.appreciated!",

That\u2019s 3k in interest. \n\nBitcoin would have to beat the 3k interest and then some in 5 years to make it a worthy investment. If you believe that 1 bitcoin will appreciate more than the loan costs you, and you can afford the loan, then go for it.\n\nOr, you take $300 a month and dca for 5 years.\n\nEither way, if you choose the loan, do us all a favour and make notes of the dca price every month. if you choose to dca, make a note about the buy price. Then compare after 5 years to see if you would have more or less bitcoin.\n\nI\u2019m currently doing the same with a 10k loan back in august. So far, I should\u2019ve dca. However, back in 2020, I should\u2019ve bulk bought and not dca.  (Also shouldn\u2019t have got greedy with margin accounts, but sometimes you have to get burnt a little to realise the bigger picture)",

I'm tired of waiting for a jump, so I'm taking the loss and getting my cash back\n\nPlus, Bitcoin is way more important that just how much fiat you can trade it with. I hope you have your own cold storage to hold your bitcoin, learn how to sign messages with your addresses, know how to set the transaction fees, etc.",
