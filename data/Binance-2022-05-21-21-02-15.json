And when trying to renew a earn product, the said that my account was locked. I tried to get an explanation of what was going on, and I got this insane answer:\n\n>Dear user, We understand your frustration. However, we are not in the position to provide any additional details, except those that had been already provided in the previous message - your account has been flagged due to either due to an internal risk assessment or a geographic restriction and as a result, we are unable to serve you further in accordance with our Terms of Use. As I said before, as soon as I have an answer regarding the funds that you have in Earn, I will let you know. Thank you.\n\nWhen asking how could I get further information, I just got this as a reply:\n\n>Dear user, No one will be able to give you additional details or reasoning. What can be said has already been shared with you.\n\nThis is mind blowing. But not in a good way at all.\n\nThe worst thing, I was in the crypto event because we're developing a crytpo project on the BSC.\n\nCould anyone give me some help?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE: After contacting me back, with no explanation whatsover, it says that it is firm, my account should be close, I should retire my funds, and that's all. I can't even retire my funds. Totally insane.** \n\n**That's the platform that everyone wants to trust to keep their funds in crypto? How can we trust a company that doesn't even explain why the close the account where they keep your funds?**",
