            "selftext": "Hi,\ncurrently I host several different blockchains on my main \"productivity\" system. I do this to preserve my privacy as good as I can and so I don't have to rely on remote nodes when interacting/transacting on these blockchains.\n\nHowever, I would like to move this data to a central server on my LAN, so I can access them from my other machines too (maybe even remotely via VPN). The data is rapidly growing though and I'm afraid I don't really want to afford several 4TB SSDs so I can expand this setup to even more blockchains and have it future proof.  \nSo what I'm looking at currently is how I could best utilize HDDs with an additional SSD cache.  \nWhat would be a good solution to use a SSD as a cache for blockchain access from wallets? I was thinking about ZFS, but they kinda separate read and write cache and I'm not sure which of both would make more sense for this setup or whether a cached system makes sense at all for this use case.\n\nDoes anyone of you have experience with these systems and give me some advice on how to best tackle this?  \nShould I simply go to a pure SSD-only solution?",

But ultimately, it's a little bit of a black box; however, by the looks of its usage, I think virtually all the blockchains are on them to keep random IO off the HDDs and on the cache for the nodes, which is nice. It definitely keeps IO load on the HDDs down and usable as a media server even with BluRay 4k Remux's.",
