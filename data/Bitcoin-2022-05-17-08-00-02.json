To learn HTML, you will need to study the various tags and understand how they behave while formatting a textual document.

Those people are probably no longer paying attention to Bitcoin and assume they just missed the boat. Well the boat is coming around for a second pass and we're getting another chance to buy at 30k so everyone that missed the 30k boat last summer now has a second chance to scoop some up while the gettin's good. I've only been buying for 1 year, but I'm already SOOOOO glad I started buying a year ago so I can only imagine how people that have been buying for several years must feel. One conversation with someone you care about could be the one that inspires them to start their Bitcoin journey rather staying a victim to a broken system that's keeping them poor. The price is low. The time is now. Make whatever adjustments you need to in order to buy as much as you can. Get rid of Netflix, get rid of Disney Plus, don't buy those expensive shoes, don't buy those expensive jeans, stop eating fast food all the dang time, and STACK LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT, THE TIME IS NOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY, THE NEXT 30K ISN'T PROMISED.",

One conversation with someone you care about could be the one that inspires them to start their Bitcoin journey rather staying a victim to a broken system that's keeping them poor. The price is low. The time is now.\n\n\n\nStop. Bitcoin will not make you rich. Even if the price doubles, your lifestyle will not change. Unless you're willing to gamble your life savings and turn $500K to a million. Turning $20K to $40K will not change your life. It will only put you in more stress while you see your $20K go up and down. Only invest what you're willing to lose. Anyone who comes up to you tells you to invest in something to \"stick it to the man\"  or calls you a \"victim of the system\" is not working in your best interest.",
