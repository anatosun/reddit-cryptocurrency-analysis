To learn HTML, you will need to study the various tags and understand how they behave while formatting a textual document.

Those people are probably no longer paying attention to Bitcoin and assume they just missed the boat. Well the boat is coming around for a second pass and we're getting another chance to buy at 30k so everyone that missed the 30k boat last summer now has a second chance to scoop some up while the gettin's good. I've only been buying for 1 year, but I'm already SOOOOO glad I started buying a year ago so I can only imagine how people that have been buying for several years must feel. One conversation with someone you care about could be the one that inspires them to start their Bitcoin journey rather staying a victim to a broken system that's keeping them poor. The price is low. The time is now. Make whatever adjustments you need to in order to buy as much as you can. Get rid of Netflix, get rid of Disney Plus, don't buy those expensive shoes, don't buy those expensive jeans, stop eating fast food all the dang time, and STACK LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT, THE TIME IS NOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY, THE NEXT 30K ISN'T PROMISED.",
