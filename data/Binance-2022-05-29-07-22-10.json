They also work with 1:1 fiat backed stable coins like CADC, EUR, NZD etc. There is more then usd pegged stable coins.

So like most things to big to fail it will be bailed out by socialising its loss a few times across retail and then spectacularly explode with the whales somehow floating down underneath a golden umbrella.\n\nUsdc and dai and busd are all to be judged on their own merit \n\nBut not even USDT is even slightly comparable to UST. And check my post history I'm not a fan of USDT, I was calling for its demise in here just a couple weeks ago.\n\nBut holy shit the mind boggles and bends and farts in exasperation trying to fathom the psyche of anyone who put money into UST.",
