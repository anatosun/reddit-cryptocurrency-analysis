Imo this doesn't change the fact that L1 needs to be improved too while keeping it as secure as it is. Taproot was the last improvement which, as far as I understand, made multisig transactions (needed to enter the lightning network) cheaper.\n\nWhat is the next step and what are ideas for the far away future?",

There wouldn't be enough L1 throughout to handle, for example, the managing of Lightning channels if there were as many users as there are people in a large country like the United States, much less the whole world, even if that were the only thing transacting on L1.\n\nSo yes, scaling on L1 is (or will be) an issue. A competing value that is very important and why the block size was not increased is that we need everyone to be able to run a node. Which means we need the disk space requirements of the block chain to not grow faster than there is availability of cheap disk space. This is important because we don't want Bitcoin to be like other crypto where running a node is so expensive that only few can do it.\n\nI don't know how we will scale L1, but I'm confident we will be able to do it. There are proposals like Lightning channels factories which will help. I suspect this is how we will scale: as-needed, one adopted proposal at a time. I'm sorry I don't know what the next step is. It's a good question that I don't have the answer to, but I will also be looking forward to new proposals and discussion around this issue.",
