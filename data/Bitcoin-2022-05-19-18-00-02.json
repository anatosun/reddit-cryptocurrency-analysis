I don't have any money in the bank I could spend on bitcoin, but I remembered I had around 20 Dollars in an old Skrill account of mine, which is now 10 Dollars because of fine's for inactivity. I have seen Bitcoin at a stable level after its massive drop so I though now would be the time to buy with knowledge from trading virtual money on the stock exchange. Was it a good idea in thought it is my first ever Bitcoin purchase or should I have waited?",

If you were, I would've asked for your BTC address and helped you top up which I like to do for newbs and people who live in places where BTC has tremendous value versus their fiat.

Think of it as Saving money.\n- Whenever you get some money from your parents as a gift, or you get an amazon gift card from relatives, or birthday money. Try to trade those with your parents for money in your bank account and then buy bitcoin with it.\n- Know that, everytime you decide to not spend the money and instead buy bitcoin, you are gifting much more money to your future self.\n- Even if the price goes up and down, dont look at it. In the future when you need money for college or need to help your loved ones with something important, thats when you can access this bitcoin as per needed.\n- its not about making money, its about having financial security in the future.",
