We were suppose to build something better then traditional financing and instead we made something a million times worse. \n\nI was hoping that somebody would join BCH that would have a plan on how to kickstart adoption, but that has not happened either.\n\nimho it's extremely likely that the entire cryptocurrency system dies and stays dead for a decade before somebody  starts a completely new cryptocurrency and this one actually becomes money. \n\nThat would mean all of us are to early, and we are not going to make it. And when the dust settles, all we have done is added a handful of the 99.9% to the 0.1%",

But we keep doing shit in fake money and keep ourselves inslaved. So I have no more sympathy. Right now we own this to ourselves. Bitcoin cash is doin the best job in adoption in the crypto sphere. It,s really frustrating.",
