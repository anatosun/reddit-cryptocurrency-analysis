This is why I stared the bitcoin cash learning centre in my local city.\n\nBecause knowledge is power, and so hardly anybody in the space wants to share that knowledge because they are afraid they will have less power.\n\nWe have to start approach everything different and our focus should be on education people for free out of passion. Because that way the BCH community will set it self apart from all the other ones.\n\nOur tools and wallets are simple enough to be taught the same way you teach somebody to use microsoft excel or word. \n\nMy learning centre is not going very well because people only show up to\n\n- want to give me money and hope to get more back\n\n- want to learn how to get rich quick.\n\nBut on the other hand I have not done proper outreach yet. Things like BCH treasure hunts and stuff. Fun stuff that is not about getting quick rich.\n\nI am going to keep on working towards this and hope to end up wth hundreds of students I can teach all these tools (and filming the classes so there is educational material)",

Then they spread it out to a suburb, then to a whole city, then to the whole country.\n\nThat's what we are doing with the BCH community.
