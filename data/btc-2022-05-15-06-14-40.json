We were suppose to build something better then traditional financing and instead we made something a million times worse. \n\nI was hoping that somebody would join BCH that would have a plan on how to kickstart adoption, but that has not happened either.\n\nimho it's extremely likely that the entire cryptocurrency system dies and stays dead for a decade before somebody  starts a completely new cryptocurrency and this one actually becomes money. \n\nThat would mean all of us are to early, and we are not going to make it. And when the dust settles, all we have done is added a handful of the 99.9% to the 0.1%",

You could take your tokens and put them to use. All these services, once a hopeful promise for Bitcoiners, were now actually happening in Ethereum. I tried them out, and they were fantastic. Best of all, version two or three of these services were being released with major improvements. The ecosystem was alive with innovation. Then I looked at BTC and saw the sterile environment it had become.  \n\n\nBCH is still promising and still has a purpose. Blockstream's resistance to innovation is going to hurt BTC bad and put them in a position of catch-up or die. BCH has a major headstart on that.",

Adoption is slow and boring, until it isn't. If the market is gonna crash and burn it might be the absolut best for BCH, because speculation and volatility will suddenly die down and adoption and slow price appreciation go hand in hand.",

Further opportunities will present themselves to  further incorporate adoption in daily use and among peer to peer. \n\nIf we agree bch has a value based on user experience, cost basis, and decentralization. What would be the dollar value ? It's obviously not independent of itself , it follows btc very closely.  \n\n\nSo in the end, it's decentralization and use case that will keep crypto strong. \n\nAlso , we shouldn't price things in dollars.
