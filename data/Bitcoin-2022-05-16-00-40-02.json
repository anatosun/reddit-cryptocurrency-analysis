Other guys will do Interact or paypal transfer for smaller amount. Some guys deal with P2P exchange but its not very popular because a lot of guys just dosent want to sign up on a exchange. Thats sound like a drug dealer ahah but the P2P and non-KYC community is real. We just dont know what the future is.   \nSome guys will take a small % on the transaction and make money like that, with time the guy who do that will become more safe with a good reputation, etc. If you are not in Quebec i cant really help you to join but i'm sure you can find some guys in your town using FB or Telegram. I really recommend you to meet in person for the first time and try to find a guy with a lot of recommendation in you town.",

From the moment the machine was put in the store, we'd have a whole new demographic of customers who came from all over just to utilize their full daily limit ($10,000) on the machine to buy Bitcoin.  Well over 95% of them were older than 50, and a significantly larger portion of them were female, though there were plenty of male regulars as well.    \n\n\nIt was a common practice for me to help people when they inevitably struggled with the machine, and I'd always work in a way to ask them what they're buying it for.  An overwhelming majority were buying it to send to someone else, and their cover stories ran everywhere from \"Sending it to my girlfriend in Canada\" to \"My husband in the military\" and even the rare \"Poor family in Africa.\"  When it wasn't that, it was people being scammed by fake 'electric companies' or refund scammers.  In my time there I asked the question \"Are you an investor in crypto?\" multiple times a day, and never once was I answered with an affirmative.  \n\n\nNow the important part of this story is that the machine itself claimed to have \"No fees\" but marked up the price of Bitcoin by TWENTY percent.  During the recent Bitcoin ATHs, the price of bitcoin was listed well over $10,000 above it's realtime market price.  I even pleaded with a few of the regulars who I had grown to have a mutual respect for to use an exchange like Coinbase or some other respectable gateway, but they were all much older and just couldn't beat the feeling that they were dealing in cash.  Either that, or many were participating in money laundering schemes that involved them receiving large amounts of cash in the mail and converting it to Bitcoin for their bosses, possibly unknowingly.",

Our machine happened to have the highest daily limits available for new accounts, and so we literally become a regional hotspot for people who use these machines.\n\nOnce they've logged in it asks people to scan their wallet using the camera on the machine.  Despite built in warnings that they should only send to their own wallet address, many people would receive QR codes through text messages, Whasapp, or other chat clients and ask me to help them scan them.  Usually I'd catch a glimpse of the contact name while doing so, and in one case a specifically a gentleman who came in every single week had a person in his contacts called \"The Blackmailer\" who would request the full daily limit in Bitcoin and send him the QR codes to send it to.  The guy refused to believe he was being scammed.  \n\nIt was helping people with that machine for so long that made me realize that some scam victims will actually fight the truth, even when the evidence is overwhelming that they're being scammed.  I believe it's because the realization would crush them, as many have spent multiple tens of thousands on these false promises, and if they stop then they realize it was all for nothing.",
