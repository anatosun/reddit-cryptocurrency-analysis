The seller puts his coins in a multisig adress +50%, the buyer puts a percentage of what he buys in the same escrow(usually 50% too). The buyer then send the bank transfer.

Also, it's really easy to use without having to signup with exchanges and all of that. I actually saw a very similar machine at a Stop and Shop in New York. I did the same thing you did and took a photo of it when I saw the premium... The funny part is I shop at the store regularly and I have never seen anybody using it. I'm assuming whoever does most likely comes late at night to do so...",

From the moment the machine was put in the store, we'd have a whole new demographic of customers who came from all over just to utilize their full daily limit ($10,000) on the machine to buy Bitcoin.  Well over 95% of them were older than 50, and a significantly larger portion of them were female, though there were plenty of male regulars as well.    \n\n\nIt was a common practice for me to help people when they inevitably struggled with the machine, and I'd always work in a way to ask them what they're buying it for.  An overwhelming majority were buying it to send to someone else, and their cover stories ran everywhere from \"Sending it to my girlfriend in Canada\" to \"My husband in the military\" and even the rare \"Poor family in Africa.\"  When it wasn't that, it was people being scammed by fake 'electric companies' or refund scammers.  In my time there I asked the question \"Are you an investor in crypto?\" multiple times a day, and never once was I answered with an affirmative.  \n\n\nNow the important part of this story is that the machine itself claimed to have \"No fees\" but marked up the price of Bitcoin by TWENTY percent.  During the recent Bitcoin ATHs, the price of bitcoin was listed well over $10,000 above it's realtime market price.  I even pleaded with a few of the regulars who I had grown to have a mutual respect for to use an exchange like Coinbase or some other respectable gateway, but they were all much older and just couldn't beat the feeling that they were dealing in cash.  Either that, or many were participating in money laundering schemes that involved them receiving large amounts of cash in the mail and converting it to Bitcoin for their bosses, possibly unknowingly.",
