I'd heard him say it previously but it hadn't truly registered with me. It makes perfect sense and when people talk of 'investing' in BTC this can be confused with investing in stocks and shares and other assets such as gold or real estate.\n\nYou literally own a thing, it's in your hands but you don't have all the crap that comes with it.\n\nIn the case of real estate you don't have to factor in future costs of maintenance or unexpected fees. You don't need insurance like you might for a piece of art or bottles of wine. You don't have high ongoing security costs like you would with gold. You don't have to rely on a bunch of company directors making wise decisions for your investment share to become more valuable. You don't have to worry that your fund manager is picking the right stocks at the right time. \n\nAll these sorts of investments cost you either financially or mentally over time and this is often incalculable and unknown. This will eat away at your investment and is often lost when you're trying to work out the value.\n\nIf you're confident in Bitcoin then you own the perfect property. Everything has a risk but to me is clear that you can dodge all those other risks by holding BTC.",

If some coder, living in Argentina, Nigeria or Thailand, makes Bitcoin somehow better (new type of wallet, Layer, etc), we all will benefit from it.

From small mom & pop investors to 10-100+ million dollar properties that the buyer never steps foot in simply because there is no better place to stick their money.\n\nSo the case for bitcoin as property is that it could be a more liquid, more sovereign investment where enormous amounts of capital can be stored that cannot be eroded away over time by insurance, tax, maintenance costs, decay etc.\n\nIts a hard one to get your head around at the beginning (especially if you are not tasked with preserving large amounts of capital)  but I do believe this will be a big part of the paradigm shift that grows BTC adoption, especially among the ultra wealthy and institutions.",

Aside from that, brick and mortar has an underlying value, and property has a long and proven track of being a relatively safe investment. Perhaps seeing bitcoin as property is hard to wrap your head because it's not a good comparison. Bitcoin may well have a bigger upside, but let's not pretend it isn't a much more risky asset to put your money in.",

If BTC consumed only 10% of Stocks, bonds and real estate that would be a BTC well over 1 Million. \n\nAt current conditions, yes maybe you could consider BTC more volatile than real estate but the idea is as the market matures(as all markets do) the volatility will decrease. Also, maybe you don't recall just 14 years ago real estate prices dropped 50-80% just about everywhere in the US and took a decade to recover.. and you would still have to pay all the taxes and expenses on top of that and be subject to any regulations of zoning, rent control, etc. \n\nThey can always make more brick and mortar. There will only be 21 Million BTC.",

To be fair this is not too different from art or gold where the uses like \u201cmaking an apartment prettier and impressing guests\u201d is kinda thin but well it is at least harder to duplicate than crypto with its 5000000 coins. So you need to be confident that humanity will decide that YOUR coin is valuable and not the 49999999 other ones.\n\nI think I agree that bitcoin seems to have the best chances. It is stable, no scammy founder is in control, supply is limited, it has great mindshare and survived a lot of crashes. \n\nI just am pretty sceptical about Saylor. Yes he is the boss of a large and pretty successful company but a lot of the stuff he says about bitcoin is just nonsensical bullshit. One time I watched an interview where he compared bitcoin mining to \u201caccumulating energy\u201d. Which is absolute bullshit since it doesn\u2019t really matter for bitcoin how many mathematical riddles you solved. There is no energy to be accumulated but it sounded cool. It seems to me he just will say anything and everything that sounds cool so tons of people invest in bitcoin and make his investment bigger. I mean fair play to him but \u2026",
