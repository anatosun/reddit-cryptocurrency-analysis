I'd heard him say it previously but it hadn't truly registered with me. It makes perfect sense and when people talk of 'investing' in BTC this can be confused with investing in stocks and shares and other assets such as gold or real estate.\n\nYou literally own a thing, it's in your hands but you don't have all the crap that comes with it.\n\nIn the case of real estate you don't have to factor in future costs of maintenance or unexpected fees. You don't need insurance like you might for a piece of art or bottles of wine. You don't have high ongoing security costs like you would with gold. You don't have to rely on a bunch of company directors making wise decisions for your investment share to become more valuable. You don't have to worry that your fund manager is picking the right stocks at the right time. \n\nAll these sorts of investments cost you either financially or mentally over time and this is often incalculable and unknown. This will eat away at your investment and is often lost when you're trying to work out the value.\n\nIf you're confident in Bitcoin then you own the perfect property. Everything has a risk but to me is clear that you can dodge all those other risks by holding BTC.",

In case of Bitcoin, the success is shared by everyone. If some coder, living in Argentina, Nigeria or Thailand, makes Bitcoin somehow better (new type of wallet, Layer, etc), we all will benefit from it. In case of the upgraded property, it's only its owner.",
