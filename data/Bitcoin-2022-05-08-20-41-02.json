(Props to BTCPayServer for being so awesome and easy to install \ud83d\udc4f).\n\n**While \\~8000 Sats or $3 seems like nothing, it means a lot to me and to the world.**\n\nI come from one of those random countries in Central America where we used to have pen pals in the  90's from the States who asked us if we had skateboards, pizza, McDonalds, or mostly coconuts (we had all, btw).\n\nI was into coding since a very young age (10) and always thought that selling stuff online was going to be the future -- but unfortunately that future was cut very short for me, a non US/European/fancy Asian citizen with a million of hurdles to overcome (which have been reduced, but sadly still exist) in order to receive money.\n\nIn order to accept payments through Paypal 15 years ago, I had to go through an incredibly weird and lucky series of event (I literally mailed papers to a bank in hopes of getting a bank account in the US and DID get the account. How in hell, I have no clue. The bank went belly up but I was lucky to withdraw before). Paypal is not without controversy, but I still thank them for having made it at least somewhat possible (I never had a bad experience with them, but know plenty of people who did).\n\nI will never forget the day I called HSBC bank, asking for a US corporate bank account and that I was ready to sign the paperwork. The minimum deposit needed was north of  $100,000 or $1 million US, I can't even remember. I felt frustrated, humiliated, and almost gave up. (I had $2000 in my bank account).\n\nSince then, the list of processors I have used has grown exponentially (in order to escape centralization and having all my eggs in one basket), some you probably never even heard of -- MoneyBookers, Clickbank, 2Checkout, Stripe, I even had plenty of customers paying me through MONEYGRAM. It was such as headache to have to explain to the Moneygram clerk that I wasn't selling weird shit. A lot of my hard-earned money disappeared when these services stopped accepting my money or the withdrawal rate was too high to afford.\n\nNow I have all the processes set up and work for bigger companies for a nice job I can't complain about, but the 19-year-old in me, who had to go through all this crap just because I was not born with the right passport can finally be in peace, knowing that others who happen to be unlucky and unbanked, with the right ideas and passion, but with the wrong papers can finally accept magic internet money.\n\n**Money for the people.**",

It was born in a time when nobody knew what a cryptocurrency was, unlike its \"competition\" which is mostly motivated by enriching its founders. This \"competition\" has leaders and officials, while bitcoin is much more leaderless. Altcoin leaders can make unpredictable changes at their whim, while bitcoin is increasingly harder to change at all.\n\nAll of this makes bitcoin the easiest to trust. No nation state is going to adopt an altcoin controlled by a Silicon Valley startup. And no altcoin can be able to replicate bitcoin's birth and its 13 years of intense battle testing.\n\nBitcoin was a unique historical event. You could think of it as a discovery rather than an invention.",

Look at the best known altcoins  \n\nLitecoin and Dogecoin are just like Bitcoin, with insignificant changes. Why would someone adopt them? They're the same, not better  \n\nEthereum attempts to be better by extending Bitcoin's in-transaction scripting to to have extra programming utility - branches and loops. Is this better? Its fans think so. But no Ethereum fan is able to initialize an Ethereum node without the software crashing. The ETH blockchain is bloated with \"contracts\", making it impossible for ordinary users to run a node, making ETH centralized in fact, even though not by design  \n\nFollow a couple of thousand other alts. Find better utility. Where Satoshi had the imagination to solve an important payment problem, there are no wannabe Satoshis who have so far been able to make a better Bitcoin  \n\nWhere Satoshi understood the prevailing rules for making networked computer systems, he chose to break many rules in order to solve a difficult problem  \n\nWhen a Satoshi wannabe makes an altcoin, he adopts Satoshi's design constraints and makes some minor tweaks  \n\nA better Bitcoin needs a new Satoshi to break some more rules to produce better utility, without reverting to centralization (backwards), and without being a solution in search of a problem",

Seeing that Microstrategy will get margin called at 21,000, I don't see how they can possibly be buying more at that level. I've supposedly heard there is a ton of institutional interest waiting on the sidelines but not much has come to fruition thus far. Sure there'll be retail interest there at 30,000 but would that be enough to hold? I don't know. If I recall correctly back to 2020, there were a few support zones in the 20's but I don't think anything near as strong as 30,000. So if 30,000 falls I think it's very likely MSTR gets margin called as BTC falls to 20,000. It makes me wonder then if these institutions are teaming up against MSTR to scoop up BTC on the cheap as it gets liquidated. Do you agree? Disagree?",

Get to know current how the current financial system/economy works (and the history) and make up your own mind on whether it is flawed or not and how. Then dig into crypto and make up your mind whether crypto can solve these problems or not. The last step is to identify which projects, if any,  have potential to solve these problems. \n\nI  like to  listen to financial podcasts or read financial books. You can start by a free week trial of blinkist: this app summarises books in about 20min of audio. Set your interest to economy/finance and you will get excellent suggestions: I enjoyed rich dad poor dad. The bitcoin standard is also really good. I bought the book after I listened to the 20 min summary.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nEdit: spelling",

Well yeah, it can't hit 10k without tagging all those levels along the way and he's not offering up any rationale for what might take it there. At this stage he's just another \"I think ya ya ya\" guy preaching to his own choirs. Both sides of this argument could use a lot more robust analysis:\n\n\\- how much of the sell off is just short term exchange rate protection (locking in to your home fiat to prevent loss of net worth), and at what level does it come back into the market.\n\n\\- personal debt is going up, personal savings are going down (thanks inflation). How much of that is impacting the BTC holdings of smaller investors (who are selling to buy food and pay bills), what impact does it have on price and will those investors be able to return to the market and when.\n\nI'd rather see stuff like that then the constant \"Moon and Doom\" that tweeter is so famous for.  But anyway, if it goes to 34k it could go to 30k. After that who knows. :)",

We have proven to the world the value of decentralised money . Look at every other time bitcoin peaked , and then it went down after . This is just the same . However if our low this time is 35k , or even 30k , or even 20k .... how high do you think this thing is going to shoot up to if that's what we start from ?\n\nTake it from me , i'm at a major loss . Just be patient . Well done BTC , i'm proud of you . Thank you for teaching me life lessons via this ride .",

Till 2021, I didn't give a damn about what Bitcoin is but now it is all I research about (watching Greg Foss for Hopium, What Bitcoin Did for philosophy and money Benjamin Cowen for TA)\n\nStarted stacking sats from Jan 2021, flipped some shitcoins, DCA'ed monthly into stacking via the lightning network and finally arrived here.\n\nUsed to hold it in a single account ledger wallet, but did not feel safe because of dictionary attacks. So, now HODLing into sparrow multi sig wallet (2 of 2 both Ledger Nano X). Stored my seed phrase safely burned underground in my backyard in a layer of concrete. HODL mode on!\n\nBest of all, its KYC free.\n\nWell, on to the next goal of 2 BTC.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d3lyakg2u6y81.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=41b1e652a7462d7fc87036157b01dca4319f6129",

That led me to start learning Austrian Economics which I am genuinely fascinated by, especially given the current state of our economy. \n\nI've therefore been trying to move away from holding fiat and instead I was look for something, anything, that would keep its value in the coming years. I then happened to stumble across a Michael Saylor podcast where I finally began to appreciate the real value of bitcoin. But what's concerning is I probably wouldn't have appreciated it had I not already been learning Austrian Economics too.  \n\nAlthough I still have a lot to learn I genuinely feel as though I'm lucky to be able to understand bitcoin in this way. I know I am late compared to many people here but in the grand scheme of things it's still very early.\n\nIt's obvious most people in society don't understand bitcoin in this way, but my question essentially is: how many people within the crypto community understand bitcoin from this (Austrian) perspective?",

A bit like how most people don't understand why the current system is flawed, everyone thinks inflation is just a normal thing and there's no other way than to have your currency devalued every year.

He believes it will lead to greater energy efficiency, property protection, and will actually limit violence around the globe. A bit abstract but it makes sense and then I really got orange pilled and went down the rabbit hole. Now it's very clear to me just how much better the properties of bitcoin are compared to anything else out there, so much so that I just simply don't see how anything else can compete with it in a global context in the long run.

What Bitcoin is trying to do is replace gold as a store of value. \n\n\n   I could have a long and drawn out conversation with a Gold supplier or I could buy Bitcoin which is fast and digital. \n\n\n   You could make an environmentalist argument, but obviously Gold is still much worse even by todays standards. There\u2019s no Bitcoin antagonist that would argue Gold is more environmentally friendly than Bitcoin. \n\n\n   Bitcoiners take the path of least resistance, meaning green energy gives them the most bitcoin for the least amount of money. When using electricity it\u2019s about where it comes from.  Bitcoin promotes green energy by a default along with prompting the discussion around how we need to utilize more green energy. \n\n\n   Bitcoin is one of only finite resource in the universe. There\u2019s an asteroid in our solar system with enough precious metals to equal that of [700 quintillion dollars](https://nerdist.com/article/nasa-studying-goldmine-asteroid-700-quintillion-dollars/). [NASA](https://www.audacy.com/knxnews/news/national/nasa-to-study-floating-goldmine-worth-usd700-quintillion) along with SpaceX and Elon Musk are planning a probe to that asteroid in the next few years. It\u2019s almost ludicrous to think that people can continue to build generational wealth with the idea of precious metals staying valuable. \n\n\n   But gold is tangible and Bitcoin isn\u2019t!! We are in a day and age where our kids live almost exclusively in a digital world. They could care less about what\u2019s tangible. Anyone that doesn\u2019t already see this is letting the world pass them by. \n\n\n   Times are changing no matter if we like them or not, but we\u2019re lucky enough to be a part of it. History is written by the victors. \n\nEdit: Yes bitcoin yes developed to be a peer to peer electronic cash system. As with anything decentralized it has evolved into a store of value.",

If you are pro-Bitcoin, even though the message that it will end fiat propagates plenty in the community, it really is a flawed idea that has seeped in.\n\nThis post is on point about it really being the replacement of Gold. I think what people fail to grasp is that ultimately, it is and never was Gold vs Fiat (throughout most of human history) or Bitcoin vs Fiat, but rather the hard money and fiat money work together in an economy.\n\nWe would never have gone this far as a species without money in general, and to sustain money in general we have needed gold standards and fiat standards dancing with each other at different periods of time, and regardless what standard we are on at any given times the Gold always has SOME value and the Fiat always has SOME value. Both are money.\n\nIn my opinion, the end game for Bitcoin is for it to be the first asset to possess the most important properties of Gold, while also being able to do some more modern things such as cheap digital transport, seamlessly going across borders, and more security than physical safes. How will it be used practically? As a new form of savings for: Families/Individuals, Businesses/Organizations, and Governments. While also being flexible enough to purchase goods and services via its divisibility and transaction system whenever someone wants to use it for that.\n\nWhere does fiat play into it? People will likely spend fiat whenever they have it before Bitcoin, or use that fiat to buy Bitcoin if they don't need it anytime soon. Why would they use fiat? Because fiat can stabilize in the future and work more like it did 50-100 years ago, around the times where countries were on Gold standards, but this time we could try the Bitcoin standard. This and in either case, Gresham's Theory.\n\nRecent history shows that at least a few countries are getting on the path to this transitionary point. El Salvador is one example, but Russia may now be an even bigger example, hinting that they are willing to buy/sell resources internationally using Bitcoin, and they have implemented some sort of Gold and Oil standard to strengthen their currency. These countries have opened up to the idea out of necessity. Should be interesting times ahead, the price isn't going to kill you just like the price of Gold isn't killing Gold bugs, I do think Bitcoin has more potential than Gold in the near and far future, the past has of course shown this trend.",

If that was your expectation then you misunderstood or were misled.\n\nFiat central banks have mechanisms, like control over interest rates, to manipulate the buying power of their currencies. These and other market  effects absolutely can strengthen other currencies vs Bitcoin in the short term (though in the long term the Bitcoin fixed monetary is expected to give Bitcoin a lot of buying power vs other currencies).\n\nThe current Treasury secretary, former Fed chair, has said she wants to strengthen the dollar to make energy cheaper (since most global energy markets denominate energy in USD) as a way to squeeze Russia since they are an energy exporter. Obviously the dollar will strengthen against other currencies, including BTC, in the short term. Long term they can't keep it up.\n\nNone of this means that Bitcoin isn't a good hedge against inflation. It is. Knowing what you know now, five years ago you would rather have put your money all in Bitcoin rather than USD. Because the buying power of Bitcoin strengthened against the dollar over that time span, even considering the short-term strengthening of the dollar we're seeing today.",

Literally the definition of a hedge against inflation.\n\nWhat you don\u2019t understand is that in November 2021 and continuing all the way to now and probably for the next year, the federal reserve has been taking actions to pump the value of the dollar. Increasing federal funds rate, selling off QE bonds, speaking hawkishly.\n\nBitcoin has been printing 6.25 bitcoin every 10 minutes and will continue to do so until it starts printing 3.125. It has no ability to counter the fed\u2019s tightening.\n\nSo bitcoin is the true value of money, and dollars are the federal reserve\u2019s play toy. AND CPI inflation is a very very very very very badly-tuned lagging-indicator of prices.\n\nHere\u2019s a non-bitcoiner\u2019s take on the dollar value of assets when the fed is tightening. https://youtu.be/fsRwNl-_P78",

I know it's rough out there if you're new, and until you go through a 4 year cycle or 2, it's easy to start feeling uncertain. But try and understand that if Bitcoin made it through the past decade and all the shit that it's endured, there's almost nothing to worry about right now. \n\nThe onramps & infrastructure continue to grow, the user adoption is growing, public awareness & acceptance is growing, mining is getting greener, use cases across LN for payments, holding as an asset, and even Fidelity stepping in to allow 20% allocation to 401k are exploding. \n\nNow let's add to this the fact that all this happened with the current and past few generations who grew up when Bitcoin did NOT even exist. Do you have any idea what's going to happen with adoption growth when the next generation who actually grew up \"aware\" of Bitcoin step into the investment space?!\n\nPatience and knowledge are 2 strong warriors. Stay the course!",

There was no reason to think last year that BTC should crash or would continue to crash. There\u2019s every reason this year to think it will.\n\nie, 2021=excellent environment for gains due to free money following a black swan. 2022=poor environment for gains due to significant macroeconomic shift.\n\nNo idea what will happen. Maybe CPI prints a bit lower and everything rallies. Maybe everything shits the bed and people pour into BTC as a safe haven. Maybe there\u2019s no bid as the market grinds down and we end up at 10k again. Maybe the moon is made of green cheese. I have no idea.

            "selftext": "Nights like tonight remind me of when I was in my 20s.  I thought I was on top of the world, career wise.  I was part of a small team that helped turn around a business that was owned by a huge conglomerate.  We doubled revenue in a year.  Corporate thanked us by cashing in.  They fired us and sold it.  Brutal.\n\nA guy who worked for a competitor whose ass we'd just kicked (before getting sold and fired) reached out to me.  I thought he was going to laugh, or even mock me.  Instead, he was gracious.  He let me vent my frustration, and then he offered me advice that stuck with me ever since.\n\nHe talked to me about Feast and Famine.\n\nWhen times are good, you feast.  Be cocky. Take risks. Play to win, and then play harder to dominate.\n\nBut when times are tough, you survive the famine by focussing all your energy on protecting what you've built.\n\nThat's solid advice, and it works in so many situations.  It even works here.\n\nSo let's put it in perspective.\n\nIt was easy to cheer when we were over 65k and headed skyward.  I don't remember what my highest buy was at, but I know it was at least 58k.  It was easy to be gleeful then.  Wheeee!!!\n\nBut what about now?  What's the plan, man?\n\nI'll tell you mine and I'm sticking to it without a shadow of a doubt: I buy and hold until the year after the next halving.  I always say \"the year after\" because the halving causes a supply shock 4 to 6 months later, and that kicks off the bull run into the next year.  So I plan forward.  Everything I do is focussed on 2025.  And come 2025, I'll start saying the exact same thing about 2029.\n\nBut that's me.  That's MY plan.  The question here is, what's yours?  Do you have one?\n\nIf you don't have a plan, you should stop what you're doing right now and come up with one.\n\nI believe the next two years are going to be rough.  I also believe the next halving (in spring 2024) will lead to a supply shock that will lead to the next major bull run through 2025.  But I also believe the bigger picture, long term, is that Bitcoin will become a major world asset if not a world reserve, and I believe other crypto currencies will blossom as well into other uses.\n\nThat's the future.\n\nBut we're the present, with Bitcoin down 50% from its high last year.  Is this a time for doom and gloom?  No.  In fact, I'll say it again: HELL NO.\n\nThis is a time to protect what you've built, and if you're able, buy with an eye toward what's coming.  If you believe in Bitcoin's future, as I do, the way forward is clear.\n\nKEEP CALM    \nAND    \nHODL ON",

Kinda like March / April 2020 when we saw the sickness breakout. Fear took over and people panicked. They dumped their satoshis and sharks gobbled them up. \n\nWhen the sharks were ready to take profits of more than 10x in under a year, there was a herd of people willing to give them money. \n\nAll they had to do was have their buddies make tweets (Elon), write a few articles, and publish news stories, and voila! The herd arrives. \n\nA herd of new bitcoiners arrived while being unaware of the fact that there\u2019s never been a single instance in history where the masses have become rich together. It literally cannot happen. In the markets, there are buyers and sellers.\n\nAs the herd sees the value of their BTC drop, they become pseudo maximalists. They say \u201cI\u2019m HODLing forever!\u201d Maybe they won\u2019t hold forever, but they definitely won\u2019t be selling for a profit either.\n\nI don\u2019t blame them. I\u2019d hold forever too... unless a perfect storm of economic catastrophes forced me to part ways with my satoshis. Inflation. Job loss. Nosebleed interest rates. Etc. \n\nWe won\u2019t see a meteoric rise in BTC until most of the masses who flooded in have closed their positions.\n\nI\u2019ll be right there ready to buy from the final exhausted seller. Like a shark would do.\n\nWhat about you?",

Enormous amounts of info and data are being added daily still. Halfwit systems like *Schufa* are still stuck in the fiat and debt mindset, oblivious to the fact that as the money supply grows, so must the infrastructure to corral it all with institutions, banks, and enforcement bodies. This means more power to politicians and thusly more powerful governments. This is ever increasing. That's the real INFLATION bitcoiners are talking about, not just purchasing power.\n\nHere in NYC I bike past the fancy new towers overlooking Central Park every day. They have 100% ownership, but only 10% occupancy. Why is that? The higher the floor, the more empty it gets. This is investment property, and a symptom of inflation. People need to cram more and more money into a shortage of ownership. In fact, it becomes part of sound capitalism to have a shortage of things outside the money. We should be cramming more and more products and services into a shortage of money, and as more products/services are added to the economy, they get crammed in too. This starts eliminating all the spectacular waste, all the cantillionaires, all the government overreach, it cracks military industrial complexes leaking an enormous amount of time, money, and resources back into society in a wealth distribution scheme at odds with robbing Jeff Bezos to give his money to people that will give it right back to him. This allows then people to work any job and save the fruits of their labor. It disintegrates borders, and unleashes effectively the power of humanity.\n\nAnd where as borrowing is all the rage in an inflationary system, lending is all the rage in an deflationary system, driving even more abundance OUTSIDE the money. Think about what that means for time.\n\nLastly:\n\n**Renewable\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc48Bitcoin**\n\n**Oil\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc48USD**\n\nFossil fuels are inseparable from fiat currency and inflation. Nothing in fiat naturally subsidizes green energy without the hand of governments in tax credits, and import duties, and write-offs. All nonsense at odds with free markets. Bitcoin will create an overabundance of energy, making profitable naturally what required the government's sign of the cross previously.",

Most people didn't like that there wasn't guaranteed safety. Most people didn't like that there wasn't easy to follow maps pointing to gold. \n\nThe people that made money slept in a ditch and ate cacti. They got there when there was no infrastructure to support them. \n\nThe people that make money in bitcoin are gonna eat the volatility and ask for seconds.",
