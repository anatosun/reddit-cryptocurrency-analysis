At this stage he's just another \"I think ya ya ya\" guy preaching to his own choirs. Both sides of this argument could use a lot more robust analysis:\n\n\\- how much of the sell off is just short term exchange rate protection (locking in to your home fiat to prevent loss of net worth), and at what level does it come back into the market.\n\n\\- personal debt is going up, personal savings are going down (thanks inflation). How much of that is impacting the BTC holdings of smaller investors (who are selling to buy food and pay bills), what impact does it have on price and will those investors be able to return to the market and when.\n\nI'd rather see stuff like that then the constant \"Moon and Doom\" that tweeter is so famous for.  But anyway, if it goes to 34k it could go to 30k. After that who knows. :)",

I had a GPU that could mine hundeds of Bitcoin a week in 2011 but I rather played Call of Duty with it. Till 2021, I didn't give a damn about what Bitcoin is but now it is all I research about (watching Greg Foss for Hopium, What Bitcoin Did for philosophy and money Benjamin Cowen for TA)\n\nStarted stacking sats from Jan 2021, flipped some shitcoins, DCA'ed monthly into stacking via the lightning network and finally arrived here.\n\nUsed to hold it in a single account ledger wallet, but did not feel safe because of dictionary attacks. So, now HODLing into sparrow multi sig wallet (2 of 2 both Ledger Nano X). Stored my seed phrase safely burned underground in my backyard in a layer of concrete. HODL mode on!\n\nBest of all, its KYC free.\n\nWell, on to the next goal of 2 BTC.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d3lyakg2u6y81.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=41b1e652a7462d7fc87036157b01dca4319f6129",

That led me to start learning Austrian Economics which I am genuinely fascinated by, especially given the current state of our economy. \n\nI've therefore been trying to move away from holding fiat and instead I was look for something, anything, that would keep its value in the coming years. I then happened to stumble across a Michael Saylor podcast where I finally began to appreciate the real value of bitcoin. But what's concerning is I probably wouldn't have appreciated it had I not already been learning Austrian Economics too.  \n\nAlthough I still have a lot to learn I genuinely feel as though I'm lucky to be able to understand bitcoin in this way. I know I am late compared to many people here but in the grand scheme of things it's still very early.\n\nIt's obvious most people in society don't understand bitcoin in this way, but my question essentially is: how many people within the crypto community understand bitcoin from this (Austrian) perspective?",

A bit like how most people don't understand why the current system is flawed, everyone thinks inflation is just a normal thing and there's no other way than to have your currency devalued every year. They all just use it because everyone else does.\n\nBut that's just my take on it.",

He believes it will lead to greater energy efficiency, property protection, and will actually limit violence around the globe. A bit abstract but it makes sense and then I really got orange pilled and went down the rabbit hole. Now it's very clear to me just how much better the properties of bitcoin are compared to anything else out there, so much so that I just simply don't see how anything else can compete with it in a global context in the long run.

What Bitcoin is trying to do is replace gold as a store of value. \n\n\n   I could have a long and drawn out conversation with a Gold supplier or I could buy Bitcoin which is fast and digital. \n\n\n   You could make an environmentalist argument, but obviously Gold is still much worse even by todays standards. There\u2019s no Bitcoin antagonist that would argue Gold is more environmentally friendly than Bitcoin. \n\n\n   Bitcoiners take the path of least resistance, meaning green energy gives them the most bitcoin for the least amount of money. When using electricity it\u2019s about where it comes from.  Bitcoin promotes green energy by a default along with prompting the discussion around how we need to utilize more green energy. \n\n\n   Bitcoin is one of only finite resource in the universe. There\u2019s an asteroid in our solar system with enough precious metals to equal that of [700 quintillion dollars](https://nerdist.com/article/nasa-studying-goldmine-asteroid-700-quintillion-dollars/). [NASA](https://www.audacy.com/knxnews/news/national/nasa-to-study-floating-goldmine-worth-usd700-quintillion) along with SpaceX and Elon Musk are planning a probe to that asteroid in the next few years. It\u2019s almost ludicrous to think that people can continue to build generational wealth with the idea of precious metals staying valuable. \n\n\n   But gold is tangible and Bitcoin isn\u2019t!! We are in a day and age where our kids live almost exclusively in a digital world. They could care less about what\u2019s tangible. Anyone that doesn\u2019t already see this is letting the world pass them by. \n\n\n   Times are changing no matter if we like them or not, but we\u2019re lucky enough to be a part of it. History is written by the victors. Which side of history will you be on?\n\nEdit: Yes bitcoin yes developed to be a peer to peer electronic cash system. As with anything decentralized it has evolved into a store of value.",

Tho its probably the most finite thing you can get.\n  \nBut it looks like our economies and countries do need infinite money or societies would not work as they are now, at least until someone develops a better model.

(Props to BTCPayServer for being so awesome and easy to install \ud83d\udc4f).\n\n**While \\~8000 Sats or $3 seems like nothing, it means a lot to me and to the world.**\n\nI come from one of those random countries in Central America where we used to have pen pals in the  90's from the States who asked us if we had skateboards, pizza, McDonalds, or mostly coconuts (we had all, btw).\n\nI was into coding since a very young age (10) and always thought that selling stuff online was going to be the future -- but unfortunately that future was cut very short for me, a non US/European/fancy Asian citizen with a million of hurdles to overcome (which have been reduced, but sadly still exist) in order to receive money.\n\nIn order to accept payments through Paypal 15 years ago, I had to go through an incredibly weird and lucky series of event (I literally mailed papers to a bank in hopes of getting a bank account in the US and DID get the account. How in hell, I have no clue. The bank went belly up but I was lucky to withdraw before). Paypal is not without controversy, but I still thank them for having made it at least somewhat possible (I never had a bad experience with them, but know plenty of people who did).\n\nI will never forget the day I called HSBC bank, asking for a US corporate bank account and that I was ready to sign the paperwork. The minimum deposit needed was north of  $100,000 or $1 million US, I can't even remember. I felt frustrated, humiliated, and almost gave up. (I had $2000 in my bank account).\n\nSince then, the list of processors I have used has grown exponentially (in order to escape centralization and having all my eggs in one basket), some you probably never even heard of -- MoneyBookers, Clickbank, 2Checkout, Stripe, I even had plenty of customers paying me through MONEYGRAM. It was such as headache to have to explain to the Moneygram clerk that I wasn't selling weird shit. A lot of my hard-earned money disappeared when these services stopped accepting my money or the withdrawal rate was too high to afford.\n\nNow I have all the processes set up and work for bigger companies for a nice job I can't complain about, but the 19-year-old in me, who had to go through all this crap just because I was not born with the right passport can finally be in peace, knowing that others who happen to be unlucky and unbanked, with the right ideas and passion, but with the wrong papers can finally accept magic internet money.\n\n**Money for the people.**",

I was part of a small team that helped turn around a business that was owned by a huge conglomerate.  We doubled revenue in a year.  Corporate thanked us by cashing in.  They fired us and sold it.  Brutal.\n\nA guy who worked for a competitor whose ass we'd just kicked (before getting sold and fired) reached out to me.  I thought he was going to laugh, or even mock me.  Instead, he was gracious.  He let me vent my frustration, and then he offered me advice that stuck with me ever since.\n\nHe talked to me about Feast and Famine.\n\nWhen times are good, you feast.  Be cocky. Take risks. Play to win, and then play harder to dominate.\n\nBut when times are tough, you survive the famine by focussing all your energy on protecting what you've built.\n\nThat's solid advice, and it works in so many situations.  It even works here.\n\nSo let's put it in perspective.\n\nIt was easy to cheer when we were over 65k and headed skyward.  I don't remember what my highest buy was at, but I know it was at least 58k.  It was easy to be gleeful then.  Wheeee!!!\n\nBut what about now?  What's the plan, man?\n\nI'll tell you mine and I'm sticking to it without a shadow of a doubt: I buy and hold until the year after the next halving.  I always say \"the year after\" because the halving causes a supply shock 4 to 6 months later, and that kicks off the bull run into the next year.  So I plan forward.  Everything I do is focussed on 2025.  And come 2025, I'll start saying the exact same thing about 2029.\n\nBut that's me.  That's MY plan.  The question here is, what's yours?  Do you have one?\n\nIf you don't have a plan, you should stop what you're doing right now and come up with one.\n\nI believe the next two years are going to be rough.  I also believe the next halving (in spring 2024) will lead to a supply shock that will lead to the next major bull run through 2025.  But I also believe the bigger picture, long term, is that Bitcoin will become a major world asset if not a world reserve, and I believe other crypto currencies will blossom as well into other uses.\n\nThat's the future.\n\nBut we're the present, with Bitcoin down 50% from its high last year.  Is this a time for doom and gloom?  No.  In fact, I'll say it again: HELL NO.\n\nThis is a time to protect what you've built, and if you're able, buy with an eye toward what's coming.

Kinda like March / April 2020 when we saw the sickness breakout. Fear took over and people panicked. They dumped their satoshis and sharks gobbled them up. \n\nWhen the sharks were ready to take profits of more than 10x in under a year, there was a herd of people willing to give them money. \n\nAll they had to do was have their buddies make tweets (Elon), write a few articles, and publish news stories, and voila! The herd arrives. \n\nA herd of new bitcoiners arrived while being unaware of the fact that there\u2019s never been a single instance in history where the masses have become rich together. It literally cannot happen. In the markets, there are buyers and sellers.\n\nAs the herd sees the value of their BTC drop, they become pseudo maximalists. They say \u201cI\u2019m HODLing forever!\u201d Maybe they won\u2019t hold forever, but they definitely won\u2019t be selling for a profit either.\n\nI don\u2019t blame them. I\u2019d hold forever too... unless a perfect storm of economic catastrophes forced me to part ways with my satoshis. Inflation. Job loss. Nosebleed interest rates. Etc. \n\nWe won\u2019t see a meteoric rise in BTC until most of the masses who flooded in have closed their positions.\n\nI\u2019ll be right there ready to buy from the final exhausted seller. Like a shark would do.\n\nWhat about you?",

This \"competition\" has leaders and officials, while bitcoin is much more leaderless. Altcoin leaders can make unpredictable changes at their whim, while bitcoin is increasingly harder to change at all.\n\nAll of this makes bitcoin the easiest to trust. No nation state is going to adopt an altcoin controlled by a Silicon Valley startup. And no altcoin can be able to replicate bitcoin's birth and its 13 years of intense battle testing.\n\nBitcoin was a unique historical event.

Look at the best known altcoins  \n\nLitecoin and Dogecoin are just like Bitcoin, with insignificant changes. Why would someone adopt them? They're the same, not better  \n\nEthereum attempts to be better by extending Bitcoin's in-transaction scripting to to have extra programming utility - branches and loops. Is this better? Its fans think so. But no Ethereum fan is able to initialize an Ethereum node without the software crashing. The ETH blockchain is bloated with \"contracts\", making it impossible for ordinary users to run a node, making ETH centralized in fact, even though not by design  \n\nFollow a couple of thousand other alts. Find better utility. Where Satoshi had the imagination to solve an important payment problem, there are no wannabe Satoshis who have so far been able to make a better Bitcoin  \n\nWhere Satoshi understood the prevailing rules for making networked computer systems, he chose to break many rules in order to solve a difficult problem  \n\nWhen a Satoshi wannabe makes an altcoin, he adopts Satoshi's design constraints and makes some minor tweaks  \n\nA better Bitcoin needs a new Satoshi to break some more rules to produce better utility, without reverting to centralization (backwards), and without being a solution in search of a problem",

Seeing that Microstrategy will get margin called at 21,000, I don't see how they can possibly be buying more at that level. I've supposedly heard there is a ton of institutional interest waiting on the sidelines but not much has come to fruition thus far. Sure there'll be retail interest there at 30,000 but would that be enough to hold? I don't know. If I recall correctly back to 2020, there were a few support zones in the 20's but I don't think anything near as strong as 30,000. So if 30,000 falls I think it's very likely MSTR gets margin called as BTC falls to 20,000. It makes me wonder then if these institutions are teaming up against MSTR to scoop up BTC on the cheap as it gets liquidated. Do you agree? Disagree?",

I would say 99% are straight up con artists giving crypto the bad reputation it has. (Just my general\nOpinion)\n\nCoinbureau is the only channel I watch and follow. \n\nThat being said,  I suggest becoming financially literate first, if you are not already. Get to know current how the current financial system/economy works (and the history) and make up your own mind on whether it is flawed or not and how. Then dig into crypto and make up your mind whether crypto can solve these problems or not. The last step is to identify which projects, if any,  have potential to solve these problems. \n\nI  like to  listen to financial podcasts or read financial books. You can start by a free week trial of blinkist: this app summarises books in about 20min of audio. Set your interest to economy/finance and you will get excellent suggestions: I enjoyed rich dad poor dad. The bitcoin standard is also really good. I bought the book after I listened to the 20 min summary.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nEdit: spelling",

They are presented and discussed in the bitcoin development community and more often than not, are implemented by a group of developers and thoroughly tested on a test net before they make their way into bitcoin mainline. The chances of a BIP breaking bitcoin are extremely low. One of the ways that\u2019s achieved is by keeping changes as small as possible before they are integrated. Furthermore, it usually takes a very long time from concept to activation. Usually several years. Plenty of time to thoroughly test the change and catch any bugs.",
