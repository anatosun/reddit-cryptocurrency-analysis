            "selftext": "I have a question that has been bothering me for some time - and I'm sure bitcoin experts can help me out. \n\nI have the following assumptions: \n\n1. blockchain as a technology will establish itself in the financial world in the long run, as the elimination of intermediaries can increase overall welfare. \n2. this will lead to the coexistence of cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies.\n3. at the same time, new possibilities arise regarding the custody and trading of securities. \n\nNow - let's look at the long-term positioning of Bitcoin. There are probably two scenarios: \n\n1. **Bitcoin establishes itself as a means of payment.**   \nFor this scenario to occur, Bitcoin's value must level off and volatility must be reduced. Where this value lies cannot be predicted. At the same time, it is also not clear whether Bitcoin will prevail as the cryptocurrency in this scenario - or whether it will be one cryptocurrency, or whether several cryptocurrencies will establish themselves. This scenario would also have a strong impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy. At the same time, it would mean that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are no longer suitable as an investment from that point on. \n2. **Bitcoin establishes itself as an investment.**  \nIn this scenario, Bitcoin would be considered like gold or shares. One can assume that either way, the use of blockchains will also revolutionise the trading of traditional investments. In my view, this would mean that the two main advantages of Bitcoin as an investment would disappear: high liquidity and independence from financial intermediaries. If these advantages disappear, only scarcity remains as an argument why Bitcoin should establish itself as an investment. But if we realise that Bitcoin does not work as a means of payment, scarcity also loses importance.\n\nAnd now my question: why should I invest in Bitcoin?",

They are secure from being exploited via 51% attacks (fake transactions).\n\nHowever, PoS systems give the power to fork the chain (and thus change the rules) to the largest stakeholders. This makes it much less neutral in terms of power dynamics between individuals and their wealth in the chain.\n\nThis might be fine for tokenized stocks, web3 whatever if that ever actually means something, etc. **but it will never be good for money itself** because it behaves like an equity. It's just not neutral enough to be non-state, non-stake holder controlled wealth.\n\nThe people in Bitcoin writing code can only change Bitcoin if the miners accept the changes. Miners can only change the code if the individuals running nodes accept the changes. Bitcoin has a balance of powers governance system similar to the US federal government and its three branches\u2013only its a global set of actors in each branch making it exponentially more secure against undue changes.\n\nPoS chains have only one governance system: Stakeholders. If the majority of stake (not to be confused with the majority of individuals) wants to change the code, it changes.\n\nBitcoins purpose is to be political neutral, stateless, fixed supply sound ***money***. It will become both a store of value and a medium of exchange once it grows much larger (market cap is only 2% of USD circulating supply). It will eventually only grow to the extent that fiat expands, or in the case where fiat no longer exists it will grow in purchasing power as technology makes producing things cheaper.",

It will not stop acting as an investment until it reaches some kind of fully adopted status.\n\nIf that means it\u2019s a reserve currency for smaller countries who wish to escape being dollarized it could very well stabilize in the next decade though I would expect some degree of volatility to exist in the exchange rate to USD.\n\nIf that means it\u2019s the main reserve asset for all nations then it would need to at least 50X in value from here (to match USD global supply given its currently the largest reserve currency). That will not be able to happen for many decades IMO.\n\nIf it completely replaces all fiat and becomes the only money in the world then it has to grow A LOT more than 50X to represent the circulating supply of all fiat currencies. This has zero chance of happening for a very long time unless fiats experience an implosion (which could happen but I\u2019m hoping for a slow faded death for the sake of humanity).\n\nGiven we have to both reach one of these stages and settle into it being the limits of Bitcoins adoption, it\u2019s likely Bitcoin behaves more like an upward roaming store of value investment for the next 20-30 years, if not our entire lifetime.\n\nOthers believe this can happen much sooner but I don\u2019t believe we can achieve this without some kind of massive societal upheaval because the amount of value that would need to switch over to Bitcoin is just astronomical.",

I mean no one ever solves their problem with the coin, they never buy anything they actually need or consume or use. They only transact for the purpose of investment specifically.

He'd worked very hard, lived frugally, and had save up money for his old age and for his children to have someday.  \n\nThe man saw that his government and banking system were \"printing\" Zimbabwe Dollars like crazy.  The man saw inflation rising in his country.  \n\nThe man took the time to understand \"money\", and \"fiat currency\", and how \"money printing\" always leads to a debased currency.  Bitcoin hadn't been invented yet, so the many converted most of savings to gold coins.  \n\nIt didn't take long until a loaf of ordinary bread cost $800 trillion Zimbabwe Dollars - much more than the man's amount of savings at the time he converted to gold.  That man had managed to preserve the value of his savings, over time.  He protected himself from \"money printing\".\n\nI see people in first world countries today in a situation very similar to the one our friends in Zimbabwe faced a few decades ago.  Fiat currencies, even the US Dollar, are going to shit, via \"money printing\".  One difference, Bitcoin HAS been invented.  Bitcoin will be the next \"money\" used by people all over the globe.  \n\nYou still have a chance to convert your fiat currency into the better form of money while your fiat currency is still worth something, while Bitcoin is still cheap compared to where it's going, and before your government attempts to force you to use CDBC.  \n\nOr you can think you're so smart, do nothing, and find out the Bitcoiner's were right all along after you're wiped out or \"imprisoned\" via CDBC.\n\nIt's your future.  It's your responsibility.  You will enjoy or suffer the consequences of what you do with the information we'd provided you today, or not.  Choose wisely.",

The fact is Bitcoin in my personal opinion is undervalued - namely because it is the only decentralised asset class and has one of, if not the, most strongest networks on Earth... and yet hasn't completely sold out. Since the world is changing its tune, people are \"getting their place\" now before mass adoption kicks in and potentially prices them out.\n\nThis is why it is seen as an investment - and that is why Bitcoin price is volatile, in addition to the leveraged trading going on. But that volatility is reducing throughout Bitcoin's lifetime. \n\nWaiting until it stabilises in order to involve yourself in Bitcoin makes yourself an end-user, like all of us will be, but not really a speculative investor - your minimalised risk comes with an expectancy of minimalised gain.\n\nBitcoin works as a means of payment thanks to layer 2 solutions such as the Lightning network - its the countries' infrastructure that need to catch up with Bitcoin, not the other way around.\n\nI'm not sure how adoption of Bitcoin by traditional finance therefore nullifies high liquidity and independence from financial intermediaries.",

Volatility can decrease, but it will never go away.\n\nYou should invest in Bitcoin because:\n\nBitcoin makes up a reserve currency, one that's relatively fixed against the entire world economy.  The economy can grow or shrink, but Bitcoin is fixed in place.\n\nScarcity does not make up a good medium of exchange. But it makes up an excellent medium of wealth preservation. Thus, Bitcoin is now a good investment because it's not established, and it will be a good investment in the future, because once established, it'll be a gold standard for wealth preservation.\n\nFinally, Bitcoin cannot be seized by governments, which makes a point for a currency that preserves your wealth even against government coercion.\n\nJust an opinion, NFA, I hope it makes a point on how it's a good investment.",

If you don\u2019t see the value in the bitcoin network over time and don\u2019t want to be a participant than there\u2019s more for me! I made the personal choice to move toward BTC because I believe there is no harder money on earth that is as transportable, salable, founded on a foundation that cannot be changed and cannot be altered by any participant without the consensus of the majority. I believe it\u2019s safe, secure and as different financial markets slowly start realizing that it is more sound than fiat currency they will start to migrate toward the bitcoin network.\n\nThe bitcoin network likely will not be the solution to scalability as a payment system but will more likely replace the current major bank final settlements systems. Transactions will occur on something like lightning.\n\nI look at usd v bitcoin and I see an emerging payment system with defined rules v a devaluing payment system that can be manipulated to artificially impact markets. I believe with a base of sound money and truly free markets of trade and money people would be far better off than central authorities trying to treat human purchasing behavior like a physics experiment that has defined laws like conservation of energy etc. human behavior doesn\u2019t have defined laws and calculus can\u2019t predict human behavior.",
