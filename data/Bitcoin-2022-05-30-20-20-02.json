Bitcoin would equal this market cap at a price of $571,428 (assuming full dilution and that no coins are lost, which obviously isn't the case but not important for now). \n\nGold isn't solely a monetary asset though. It has value as an industrial metal, used in semiconductors, dentistry, etc, and as a decorative asset (jewelry, antiques, etc). \n\nAre there any reputable studies or estimates out there that break down the market cap of gold as influenced by each of these three categories? My sense is that gold as a monetary asset would constitute the majority of its market cap value, if not the plurality of it, and would love to see some actual estimates.

But, there are estimates that copper's market cap is in the trillions when looking specifically at total reserves (850 million tonnes at $10,000 per tonne) = $8.5 trillion. Total amount mined throughout history is estimated to be slightly lower but still close to this number. As for value consumed per year, that number is around $300 billion (30 million tonnes at $10,000 per tonne).\n\nThis is apples to oranges though, given Copper is FAR more abundant: only 250 thousand tonnes of Gold have been discovered to date, 80% of which has already been mined. You are spot on in that its more scarce but it is no longer used as a medium of exchange pretty much anywhere in the world, meaning that its value is no longer as a currency but rather as a scarce commodity.",

When they are defeated, their immense experience and power transfers to the victor in a storm of lightning and curiously excessive sweating. After millennia, only a few remain, and \"The Gathering\" is organised, to settle this ancient war.\n\nAnyway, it got me thinking about the scarcity of Bitcoin. There is of course a 21 million cap on the supply, but it is common knowledge that there will never be anywhere near that number of bitcoin in circulation, with perhaps 6 million permanently lost already. In fact, over time it would seem that the amount of bitcoin in the hands of the living will continue to decline, as wallets become inaccessible due to poor estate planning, or lack of heirs.\n\nThen it struck me, like the aforementioned lightning, surging through my mind and body with the power of the bitcoin warriors that have passed already. Drenched in sweat, it became clear to me that we have created a clan of \"immortals\", although not in human lifespan. Instead our lifeforce has been pseudonymously carved on an eternal timechain, our power transformed into information, passed on forever by our kind. You each hold some measure of this great power... but if I can find you, and destroy you in battle, your coins will be lost, and your power will become my own.\n\nSo it is apparent, the war has already begun. I hereby name myself Victor, of the Kurgans. Prepare yourselves, for **there can be only one**.",
