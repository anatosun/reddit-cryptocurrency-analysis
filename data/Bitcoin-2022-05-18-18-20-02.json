You see, Diablo 2 does not have an inherently \"good\" currency in-game.  If you play Diablo 2 then you know I'm talking about forum gold on jsp.\n\nUsing that virtual currency as a kid really helped open me up to Bitcoin.  And funny enough, learning a lot about Bitcoin now as an adult has taught me how forum gold is a god awful currency.\n\nI've devised an alternative currency structure using real Bitcoin payments to verify a Proof-of-Diablo Clone.

It's good for ya. \n\n\nI dont know about you guys but I'm hodling until BTC is the most widely adapted, desired, and valued currency; and at that point I'm still not selling. Once the dirty fiat becomes BTC it does not become fiat once again. One does not simply sell their BTC for fiat. No....it will be held and held and held until being a satoshi millionaire or billionaire is the equivalent of massive wealth by today's standards. Then and only then is it OK to begin further decentralization of the network by unleashing the horde of hodlers. We will begin to transact with each other and merchants. The world will want our BTC and it will be our duty to finally give it to them, but they will pay a high price for it. It will be necessary to begin transacting with BTC at this point because the network will become stronger if we give it to others for their goods and services.\n\n\nBut here's one point I hope some of the new Bitcoiners take to heart. Don't ever ever ever sell your BTC for fiat. For one reason you will pay capital gains tax on it if you sell for fiat, so it's much better to hodl for a long time and wait until 90% adoption comes. Another reason is because you will be placing your wealth under the control of the very ones who have enslaved humanity for much of our history, the central bankers and governments. \n\n\nMass adoption is coming. Until then accumulate no matter what the price is and HODL! Bitcoin is about the long game monetary revolution. If you don't believe me about the mass adoption coming go look at what strike is doing with the lightning network to connect merchants and consumers and the new contact-less payment card using BTC network.",

I actually use BTC frequently, but only as a temporary means to transfer money.\n\nIt terms of utility, the price of BTC doesn't matter, as long as it's stable (which it isn't, has never been and may never be). If you want to use it as a medium of exchange for goods and services, or transfer of funds, the price doesn't actually matter: 1 BTC could be $1M or $1, you'd just buy some, send it, and the recipient would redeem it in the currency of their choice (or you buy something with it, but same idea).\n\nI fail to see how the belief that BTC's value as compared to the US dollar will increase over time is anything but circular logic that nearly 100% depends on the majority of BTC market participants holding the same belief.\n\nThere's nothing underpinning the actual $ value of BTC besides exchanges. Unlike stocks, which at least grant you ownership stake in an actual tangible corporation, or precious metals, which have properties that aren't reproducible, BTC itself has no underlying value as an investment if, in the future, no one desires to actually hold onto it.\n\nSo it's difficult for me to reach a conclusion other than BTC's \"value\" being nearly all based on the hope that someone else in the future will want to purchase it from you for more than it's worth now, for...reasons??\n\nI would love to have my mind changed, so I would love some thoughtful responses.",

At times tobacco has been the currency. Today some people use dollars. People seem to instinctually desire to have these \"waypoints\" for their value. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother underlying mechanism backing up bitcoins value is that in order to send bitcoin there is only one thing which is accepted as payment for the transaction fee, and thats bitcoin. So you need bitcoin to send bitcoin, this provides some underlying value. What does bitcoin \"do\"? it allows you to send money as you stated. So that is one anchor on the baseline of value, one thing you can only do with bitcoin is pay the transaction fee. And it lets you send the money anywhere, final settlement can be essentially instant if you want to pay a higher fee or you can pay a lower fee and it may go slower. No one can stop the payment, and if you really want to and exercise some caution, you can retain anonymity as well. here's another thought why do we choose to use gold and not some other rare element.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother thought: in some sense, everything has bubbles. Stocks go in to bubbles, people buy and the value goes higher cause other people buy. people. buy purely in hopes to sell for more later, this pervades everything, and often the value of a stock will eventually reach an unsustainable level before crashing down to a level at which people think is too low, then it will go back up, and then back down, and so on. That issue, of people buying things simply to sell them for more in the future, that is something which seems to pervade every investment. Yes the company may one day be worth that, thats the concept of potential. And bitcoin may one day be worth some amount as well.

Colonial Pipeline Co. ransom demands last year - the Bitcoin was sent to a wallet address and was moved around a bit. It was traced and when brought onto an exchange to be withdrawn, it was frozen and seized. I have no problem with this. This completely removes this notion that Bitcoin cannot be traced. \n\n\nCash will continue to be the main way that criminals finance their activities, not Bitcoin. \n\n\nHow does preventing a savings vehicle from being controlled by the government cause harm to everyday people?

All you need is a smart phone and internet, which most of the world has access to. This will only improve with time. \n\n\nBitcoin cannot be corrupted. It is the people taking the power back from the corrupted elites that have been irresponsibly inflating billions of people's life savings away.\n\n\nWe NEED Bitcoin to work. We can't trust the money printer in the hands of humans. We are way too easily corrupted. Decentralization is key.\n\n\nBitcoin is more than getting rich.

That the dollar (and likely all other fiat) will die out because everyone started saving & transacting in BTC instead.\n\n**This is what we call financial privilege.** You don't realize how money actually works in other countries around the world & throughout history because you've been living with the world's strongest currency & best financial network throughout your lifetime. Sadly, reality doesn't work like that elsewhere.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjvSqaGhKQI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjvSqaGhKQI)\n\nUnbacked fiat is an experiment whose time was drawing near and like so many other civilizations in the past, is due to collapse as people lose faith in it. Sounds apocalyptic, but it has happened countless times already.\n\nAt least this time you have bitcoin to fall back on and protect your savings. I'd say that is valuable, wouldn't you?",

Gold is valuable because it\u2019s scarce and have applications such as electricity, jewelry, and etc. But how does gold scale in terms of being transactionable?

Gold is not very easy to transact nor transport. Imagine transacting with someone who bring a bar of bar. You will get robbed and worse yet no the transaction is not going to be fast as people got to inspect to see if it even is real. So Bitcoin comes into play. You see you can store and transact with bitcoin far easier than you can with gold. Though it is slow and newer technology are faster than btc now. It is seen as a store of value as state in reason 3\n3. A store of value. As btc is slow and old you shouldn\u2019t count it out. As the first cryptocurrency it has never been shut down nor hacked since it\u2019s inception. For 13 years no hack or issue have occurred with the network making it the most trustworthy on the market. As people can see it can be trusted, more people will flourish into it. As that happen the price will stabilize and barely move  like gold",

Now thy own large volumes and apply short selling proven methods for their financial markets also on Btc to shift holding of less strong owners to their own pockets.

            "selftext": "I emailed my employer's 401k provider about Fidelity's decision to implement Bitcoin into their retirement accounts. This is what they said: \n\n\"When it comes to planning for a secure retirement, cryptocurrencies are too unpredictable to count on for the long-term right now and can put participants\u2019 hard-earned savings in jeopardy. Recent guidance from the Department of Labor demonstrates that the federal government has its own concerns with plan fiduciaries that make cryptocurrency available in their investment lineups. The release states that there will be further analysis conducted and DOL will target plans that offer digital assets and related investments in their standard investment lineup and through self-directed brokerage accounts. While no further guidance is required when issuing a Compliance Assistance Release, there is hope that DOL will provide further clarity given the strong industry response to the guidance. We will continue to support our clients and their employees with solutions designed for the long-term nature of retirement investing. We\u2019re aware of our competitor\u2019s stance, but we\u2019re taking this approach because our core belief is to do the right thing and help plan sponsors and their participants build their financial security. For a variety of reasons, digital assets just don\u2019t appear to be part of that equation yet.\"\n\nHow should I respond? \n\n*Notice: Please refrain from talking about not your keys, not your coins. I am aware of this third party risk. I believe it's smart to diversify in all aspects of life, and this includes having multiple wallets holding Bitcoin. It is especially appealing to equip the tax benefits that a 401k provides.*",

Money managers who can't even keep up with millennial's returns who are passively saving in Bitcoin.\n\nMaybe send them some of Fidelity's papers on Bitcoin too, and why not putting a small percentage of capital in it is a disservice to clients missing out on 50% portfolio gains for a small 1% to 5% allocation",

If you ignore at least one security-rule the chance of losing all your bitcoin at some points increases significantly. Therefore these coins get stolen anyway at one point.\nExaggerated example:\nIf i printed my seed phrase on a shirt and went to public places, then i couldnt really blame someone but me for being robbed.",
