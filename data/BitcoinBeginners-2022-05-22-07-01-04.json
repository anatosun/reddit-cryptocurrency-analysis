You can't get 100% of miners to agree to censorship. hell, good luck getting 10%. one mining pool tried that and they got hit by a ton of backlash.\n\nAnd if it *were* , that would open our finances to being controlled by the government. They could just censor all our transactions on a whim. That is exactly what bitcoin seeks to avoid.\n\nBitcoin is uncensorable for a reason.",

What differentiates you from the person who initialized the transaction? If there was a good solution for that, it would be implemented long ago.. so if you got some mechanism that would be efficient you can always propose a change",

That is, someone stole the keys from the safe, but didn't spend the coins. The applicant wanted the coins sent to an address in his new wallet  \n\nThis is the type of scam your suggestion encourages",

You cannot create transaction finality and for all the benefits of chargeback protection you get the drawbacks of having your money taken or seized by the government , bank , or another individual with a civil suite",
