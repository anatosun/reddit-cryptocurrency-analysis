I got mine off of Amazon but if you buy one make sure you buy it from the company \"Ledger\" If you buy from a reseller or some off brand product you're taking a risk of someone stealing your assets.\n\n2. I applied for the crypto wallets on RobinHood as soon as I could because they were rolling them out in baby steps, I'm not sure if everyone can send and receive yet, but you should have a \"send\" button somewhere on the app when you click on dogecoin. On the desktop website click the 3 dots on the top right of the buy/sell box, there should be an option to \"send/recieve\".\n\nIf you don't then you should have an option to join a waitlist. Best of luck.",
