            "selftext": " In a relatively short period of time, NFTs have wreaked havoc on the crypto market.\n\nAs a large fan of art, collecting, and NFTs, this period in art when art and the NFT world collide inspires me much. NFT is reaching a wider range of enterprises, fashion houses, and designers, according to what we're hearing.  \n\nTo be honest, I began collecting at a young age, starting with marbles, sports cards, and other small items. NFT collecting attracted me as I grew older and witnessed the growth of technology, but I still wanted to keep the tactile part of collecting.\n\n I've just visited a few different markets/projects, both for gaming and art, and I must say that I really enjoy how SK8coin is going and can't wait to see all of their new collections. \n\nBut I've found that I'm always spinning the same ones, so I forced myself to go out and find some new ones to see what other options I had with new NFTs. This Ludo Showcase, which operates similarly to Instagram for NFTs, is an extremely useful searching tool when it comes to the new NFT collection. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n If you have any information about some amazing new marketplaces, I'd love to hear from you!",
