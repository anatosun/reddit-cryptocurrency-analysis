Scaling has NOTHING to do with the consensus algorithm and hence whether it is POW or POS is completely irrelevant to the scaling issues.\n\nAlso, he is verifiably wrong that blockchains with POW are more inefficient at scaling than blockchains with POS. A POW blockchain actually becomes more and more efficient at scale, since the energy required to discover a block is not correlated to the number of transactions going in to the block. Sure, there is a verfication cost that is correlated to the number of transactions, but that is a tiny fraction. So mining a block where 10.000 tx goes in or mining a block with 1.000.000 transactions going in is the same in terms of mining-energy usage - ie. energy cost pr. transaction goes down with scale.   \n\n\nHe is right about one thing though - BTC has no future is a payments crypto, because it's blocksize is limited and the scaling tech work done on e.g. BCH is sorely missing on BTC.",
