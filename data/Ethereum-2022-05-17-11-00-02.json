            "selftext": "In short: Ethereum scales with rollups & data availability sampling. But what does that mean?\n\nFirstly, I'll note that the Ethereum roadmap is evolving, so whatever you may have read is already out of date. Especially all the 2018/19 articles about sharding and \"Ethereum 2.0\" - yeah, those are obsolete. Here, I'll briefly describe the state of affairs in February 2022.\n\n# Rollups\n\nRollups are layer 2 chains that fully inherit Ethereum's security, decentralization, liquidity & network effect properties. [Multiple rollups are live today](https://l2beat.com/), with application-specific rollups like dYdX, zkSync 1.x and Loopring mature & optimized already. Smart contract rollups like Optimism, Arbitrum and StarkNet are in their early stages and awaiting optimizations through 2022.\n\nOptimized rollups today are capable of $0.10 transaction fees with up to 4,500 TPS. Certain highly optimized rollups like dYdX can even scale up to 12,000 TPS. The likes of dYdX, Immutable X and Loopring actually have zero gas fees for trades as it's abstracted from the user. But this is just the beginning. This is like smart contracts in 2016.\n\nThe next question becomes - how can we push rollups further?\n\n1. Rollups and application developers themselves will continue to optimize. We have seen Optimism decrease transaction fees by 30% in January, with another 30% cut due soon. Arbitrum also cut their fees in January, with Arbitrum Nitro estimated to slash fees by 50%. This will continue throughout 2022. [Aave developer Emilio describes](https://twitter.com/The3D_/status/1485732340571807745) how they have reduced transaction fees 10x to $0.16-$0.25 on optimistic rollups through optimizations. These are some examples - costs on rollups will continue to decrease over time as they mature.\n2. Unlike L1s, rollups get cheaper the more activity there is. So as rollups mature, there's more activity, and token incentives, we'll see rollups get cheaper.\n\n# The Surge\n\nThe Surge are upgrades to Ethereum consists of multiple steps that will open the floodgates for rollups. First, we will have intermediate steps like [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488) or [blob-carrying transactions](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/blob_transactions_simple). These will drop transaction fees by 5 times or more, over and above the two points described above. At least one of these intermediate steps is likely to be implemented around the end of 2022.\n\nThe final stage for The Surge is [danksharding](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/sh1trh/danksharding/) \\- a data layer built specifically to accelerate rollups. This integrates data availability sampling, and ushers in a new paradigm for blockchains. With data availability sampling, the more decentralized your network is, the more capacity there is for rollups. As bandwidth improves and Ethereum decentralizes, capacity will continue to increase. Over the years, there'll be enough to have millions of TPS across rollups - enough so the whole concept of TPS and transaction fees melts away. We'll be sitting and laughing about the time we used to worry about gas fees. Danksharding will roll out over time, with the first steps likely happening in 2023.\n\n# Statelessness & zkEVM\n\nWith The Surge, rollups will have massive scale and ultra low transaction fees. But Ethereum L1 will still be expensive. This doesn't matter because the end users will all be on rollups. But Ethereum L1 will also scale, first through statelessness, and then several years down the line with zkEVM. Even then, the cheapest fees will continue to be on rollups, which is why most people will just use rollups.",

                            "response": "\"data availability\" is about on-chain data. It means rollups can post data on the blockchain and be confident that the data will be secure, unchanging and available in the future. \n\nThe way I like to think about it is that a rollup is itself a blockchain, and you can \"sync from genesis\" using the data that they previously posted on Ethereum. Meaning they don't have to worry about running thousands of nodes to secure/decentralize their data and guarantee its uptime/availability, since Ethereum does that for them.\n\nSo if you want to mess with a rollup's current state, you have to alter the data it posted on Ethereum in the past, meaning you have to mess with Ethereum's current state which is very hard to do.",

It's technically up to the rollup to decide what token is used to pay fees on it, as long as they can sell it for ETH to actually settle the proofs to mainnet. \n\n> why have LRC or whatever token and why does it need a separate value?\n\nIt might be a governance token for a DAO in charge of L2 development, or it might be used for fee-sharing with a DEX like Loopring. Or it could be used to incentivize running L2 nodes, or any number of things. It's a completely open design space. \n\n> why will this not be replaced with some new scaling tech or just multi-chain?\n\nIt's the most scalable technology we have right now, bar none. If something better comes along it could be replaced just like sharding was replaced and just like multi-chain is being replaced, but we don't know of anything like that.",

PoW achieves this by making it very expensive to reorg the chain by spending a shit ton of energy on an alternate fork. PoS achieves it by having block producers put up Ether as collateral so that anyone caught trying to reorg will be slashed (and any reorg from past the point of finality will slash at least 2/3 of all Ether staked so that alternate fork is very unlikely to be considered the canonical one by pretty much anyone)\n\ntl;dr [the merge won't lower gas fees](https://willthemergelowergasprices.org/)",

Every so often, L2 transactions will be rounded up into distinct batches, and these batches are posted on the Ethereum network, where they are verified and stored.\n\nThis verification and storage, as well as the batches themselves, use L1 gas just like any other L1 transaction, meaning that, by extension, L2 transactions also use L1 gas, just much, much less of it.\n\n> Do we know how much Eth L2 solutions currently use?\n\nIt depends on the exact type of solution, but, to my knowledge, it can be anywhere from the cost of an ERC20 token transfer, to the cost of a token swap, or more.",
