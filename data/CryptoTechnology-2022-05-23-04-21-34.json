I think?) without performance degrading, but is this \"decentralized\" enough for you? Let's say in a perfect world there are 300 validators and they all hold the exact same amount of tokens. Are you okay with 300 validators possibly holding this power? Why or why not?\n\nNot to mention Terra halting their blockchain. Do you consider this a good thing? On one hand it screams centralization, but on the other I am glad a community can have control over their network like this.\n\nAt this point I'm just rambling. I'd love to hear what your thoughts are though!",
