Ledger is perfectly fine but I prefer Trezor. \n\nFor me, it comes down to looks. Screen size helps. Ledger looks more like a USB drive. Trezor is a bit larger and bulkier. It's really not much of an argument rather than a situation I've created in my head. \n\nIf a suspected intruder was to open your drawer of gadgets, drives, or whatever you have in your drawers... I feel like they might be more apt to take something that looks like a USB drive(for multiple reasons - crypto, data files, any number of things that you'd keep on a USB drive) whereas the Trezor just looks like a thing. (That obviously goes out the window if they're looking for something specific and know what a Trezor is). \n\nOne thing /u/Benis_Benis_Benis said, at some point consider multiple hardware wallets as your stack of sats grows. Hardware wallets already help me sleep better at night but it also helps to know if just one were to be stolen, I wouldn't lose everything. Luckily, I have mechanisms in place to recover funds quickly before the thief ever had a chance to transfer stolen funds.",

Then they\u2019d have to know if there is enough crypto on that wallet to be worth the work of brute forcing it. Or if the thief goes the route of reselling the device it\u2019s not like there is a huge market for them anywhere so it\u2019ll probably take a minute to sell. \n\nSo, I believe unless you\u2019re dealing with a professional cyber criminal / home intruder you\u2019ll have ample time to get a new wallet and recover your crypto before anything even happens with the stolen wallet(s). Which is not an impossible scenario for someone to find themselves in, but I think it\u2019s a pretty unlikely scenario. \n\nI honestly just leave my wallets somewhere easy to access around the house, and I have my keys hidden and locked away in a secure location.\n\nImo as long as we have the keys it doesn\u2019t matter if someone takes everything or the house burns down, just order a new wallet and we\u2019re good to go. \n\nRegardless, there\u2019s no need to go telling everyone on here your hiding spots ahaha\n\nAnyways I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re getting a Trezor, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be happy with it, and best of luck with the future rental property!",

The difficulty of mining a block changes depending on the rate at which blocks were solved over the previous 2016 blocks, which in turn is dependent on the total hash rate of all the miners in the system.\n\nThe halving just reduces the reward for mining a block by half and does not impact the difficulty of mining a block.",

                    "response": "I recommend looking into some dynamic DCA strategies. Looking at the macro of BTC, there are definitely better times to buy then others. I like to buy Bitcoin on a DCA schedule but I weight my buys so that if we get a real juicy dip, I have cash on hand to load up. Check out Ben Cowen or Jason Pizzino on YT for some different strategies on how to scale in buys for a more optimized accumulation pattern. A good rule of thumb is anytime BTC is around the 200W moving average, say +/\u201015%, you are in a relatively good spot to scale in. A dynamic strategy might work something like this: at +20% (from the 200MA) you buy X amount, at 15% you buy 1.2X, at 10% you buy 1.5X, at 5% you buy 1.8X, at the 200W MA you buy 2X, at -5% (meaning 5% below the 200W moving average) you buy 2.2X, etc....\n\nThere are a lot of ways you can optimize your DCA to get a slightly better cost basis. This is just one simple example to demonstrate how you could scale in. Learn how to set limit buy orders so that you have these all planned out ahead of time and aren't scrambling to scale in when the exchanges are crashing/overloaded during a big dip. Most importantly is to make a plan and stick to it! Welcome to the community!",
