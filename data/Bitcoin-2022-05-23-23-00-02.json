The difficulty of mining a block changes depending on the rate at which blocks were solved over the previous 2016 blocks, which in turn is dependent on the total hash rate of all the miners in the system.\n\nThe halving just reduces the reward for mining a block by half and does not impact the difficulty of mining a block.",
