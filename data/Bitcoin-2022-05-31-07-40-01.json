Their markets are likely manipulated, filled with fraud, aid in ecological problems, are riddled with criminality, and certainly the culture surrounding them is at times ridiculous (queue memecoins, moons, lambos, maxi dreamers, tether, etc). We get it buttcoin. How is that any different than most any economic market in the world? The future is unknown. We get it buttcoin. Crypto could fail. But hey, 13 years later bitcoin is still here, still has a path to be determined, is far more relevant in the public eye than ever, and has plenty of room to grow. Screw that sub. It\u2019s just a hater echo chamber attaching itself to anything and everything it can that fits their narrative. That said, it\u2019s the same thing in here, right? Here\u2019s to 10 more years of their shouting from the sidelines.",

The demand for current supply will hold much more weight determining immediate term valuations than the fractional decrease in minted supply post halving effect. The hype will still be there which should always gain attention in trade volume at halving, but I don\u2019t actually see the waves of growth staying as exponential in the future. Far more important for adoption to increase  the demand than halving at this point.",
