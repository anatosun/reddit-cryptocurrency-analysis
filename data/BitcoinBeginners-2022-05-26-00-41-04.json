But only a [seed phrase is not enough](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/seed-phrases-are-not-enough)\n\nYou can import an existing seed phrase into multiple wallet software if they \n\n-\tsupport the specific structure (seed format, i.e. how it was created, BIP39)\n-\tknow how to find those coins (derivation paths, BIP 44, 84, 89)\n-\tsupports the coin itself (bitcoin, etc.)\n\nNote, a \u201cgood\u201d wallet should bare minimum have this information available to you as their supplier documentation.\n\nLuckily, [most wallets do follow BIP39](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/list-of-bip39-wallets-mnemonic-seed) for mnemonic phrases and utilize standard derivation paths.\n\nElectrum does not generate a BIP39 seed phrase but can import one.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about seed phrases, check out r/seedstorage",
