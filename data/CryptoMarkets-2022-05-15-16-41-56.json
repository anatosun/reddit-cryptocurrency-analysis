            "selftext": "Speculation and possible FUD post. Please share your thoughts.\n\nLet\u2019s say a bad acting large institution wants to de-peg tether. How could they do it? I think we all probably correctly assume Tether doesn\u2019t have enough dollars or cash equivalents backing it.\n\nBig institution could buy or borrow 10 billion USDT. Sell it. Cause panic selling that turns into a death spiral? Is this possible?\n\nLet\u2019s say the big institution successfully causes the panic selling. Then BTC falls to from $30k to $10k. Big institution buys 10 billion dollars of BTC (1 million BTC). Then they pump BTC to $100k. Now big institution has a 100 billion dollar BTC portfolio. 10 billion was flushed down the toilet. Another 10 billion invested. They made 80 billion in profit. (If they could even sell 1 million BTC)\n\nThe charts for UST (Terra Luna\u2019s stable coin) and USDT (Tether) are looking eerily similar.\n\nUST (Terra Luna former stable coin) 7 day market cap (initial drop \\~ 22% in 6 hours)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jf63cdhu1oz81.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=b50005d4c18b89328f2f5172e3b077878e11d737\n\nUSDT (Tether) 7 day market cap (9% drop in a little over 3 days). Looks like multiple large sells may be staggered here. Institutional de-risking or the start of something nefarious?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4eouopxw1oz81.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8efd2e33ca0cd623fafff8d4605868616098d5d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear USDT has ever had more than \\~ 3% dip in market cap. We are currently triple (9%) that drop.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fq4ce92z1oz81.jpg?width=1168&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=924ef56992e0735b0a2492ce155ebd08dbe7d7a3\n\nThe price of USDT is also looking shakier than it has in the last year. You can see it still hasn't quite recovered to its normal level.\n\n1 year Tether price\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m6j7a9n12oz81.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24db42d680cac49b7cfe7a87e5838c6f4161a533\n\n30 day Tether price\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pkrq41r22oz81.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23032aeb2846693e0ce982c6f3685d9f63277af2\n\nIs this cause for real concern or just a blip? Is the same thing that happened to UST happening slowly to USDT?\n\nI\u2019m just a regular moron so please poke holes in this because I can\u2019t get it out of my head.\n\nAlso if you haven\u2019t seen this yet, watch it - Coffeezilla\u2019s video \\[Exposing Tether - Bitcoin's Biggest Secret\\]([https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-whuXHSL1Pg&feature=youtu.be](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-whuXHSL1Pg&feature=youtu.be))",

As long as it stays very close to $1USD, everything is rosy.\n\nIt's when/if its unit value starts decreasing along with its market cap that things get interesting. A rational investor would panic and take 90c in the dollar if that happens, thus causing more selling pressure and a price crash.\n\nIf tether can go to a very low market cap and retain it's USD peg, that proves the critics wrong and shows that Bitcoin's market cap is real - and not just a result of Tether printing money every time it dips.\n\n... of course, if it does de-peg, that'd prove the critics right and raise concerns that Bitcoin's meteoric rise in 2017 and price ever since was caused by Tether printing USDT fake money... putting a retracement to below $5,000 on the cards.   \nSome would see that as concerning, others as an excellent buying opportunity.",
