            "selftext": "Speculation and possible FUD post. Please share your thoughts.\n\nLet\u2019s say a bad acting large institution wants to de-peg tether. How could they do it? I think we all probably correctly assume Tether doesn\u2019t have enough dollars or cash equivalents backing it.\n\nBig institution could buy or borrow 10 billion USDT. Sell it. Cause panic selling that turns into a death spiral? Is this possible?\n\nLet\u2019s say the big institution successfully causes the panic selling. Then BTC falls to from $30k to $10k. Big institution buys 10 billion dollars of BTC (1 million BTC). Then they pump BTC to $100k. Now big institution has a 100 billion dollar BTC portfolio. 10 billion was flushed down the toilet. Another 10 billion invested. They made 80 billion in profit. (If they could even sell 1 million BTC)\n\nThe charts for UST (Terra Luna\u2019s stable coin) and USDT (Tether) are looking eerily similar.\n\nUST (Terra Luna former stable coin) 7 day market cap (initial drop \\~ 22% in 6 hours)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jf63cdhu1oz81.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=b50005d4c18b89328f2f5172e3b077878e11d737\n\nUSDT (Tether) 7 day market cap (9% drop in a little over 3 days). Looks like multiple large sells may be staggered here. Institutional de-risking or the start of something nefarious?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4eouopxw1oz81.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8efd2e33ca0cd623fafff8d4605868616098d5d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear USDT has ever had more than \\~ 3% dip in market cap. We are currently triple (9%) that drop.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fq4ce92z1oz81.jpg?width=1168&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=924ef56992e0735b0a2492ce155ebd08dbe7d7a3\n\nThe price of USDT is also looking shakier than it has in the last year. You can see it still hasn't quite recovered to its normal level.\n\n1 year Tether price\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m6j7a9n12oz81.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24db42d680cac49b7cfe7a87e5838c6f4161a533\n\n30 day Tether price\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pkrq41r22oz81.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23032aeb2846693e0ce982c6f3685d9f63277af2\n\nIs this cause for real concern or just a blip? Is the same thing that happened to UST happening slowly to USDT?\n\nI\u2019m just a regular moron so please poke holes in this because I can\u2019t get it out of my head.\n\nAlso if you haven\u2019t seen this yet, watch it - Coffeezilla\u2019s video \\[Exposing Tether - Bitcoin's Biggest Secret\\]([https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-whuXHSL1Pg&feature=youtu.be](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-whuXHSL1Pg&feature=youtu.be))",

Mainly because most of the Tether are in big wallets and these people will not do it because they know the consequences of that and they and their whales friends don't want to lose their money.\n\nBut it is just my opinion, if something I have learnt from crypto is that everything can happen, big crashes or big bull runs in any moment",
