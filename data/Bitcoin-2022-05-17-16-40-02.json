Just upload the file (or files), give the link to the person that would like to buy something from you, get paid, withdraw anytime, immediately.\n\nSimple as that.\n\nhttps://poof.run\n\nShould mention that the app was made for Desktop-use, mobile view is broken, sorry.\n\nActually, I've created it few years ago, but just never really promoted to anyone except few posts on reddit.\n\nJust to be cautious, don't keep the earned sats for too long, just in case something happens as it is custodial service. Hacks/stuff happen. It's my hobby project. No warranties as they say :)\n\nThis is how it works:\n\nAs there is no \"accounts\", no sign-ups or logins, \"semi-anonymous\", I've implemented this called - \"key\" system. Key is like an account. For every download that someone pays, you get paid straight to that key. Later, or whenever you want, by using that key, you can withdraw your earned money.\n\nThe flow is like this:\n\n1) Upload a file, copy and save the generated key to your secret location - it should be never leaked or posted somewhere.\n\n2) After an upload you also will get the download link. Post that link with your file you want to sell in forums, chats and wait for purchases.\n\n3) When ready, you can withdraw (or check balance) your money through https://withdraw.poof.run to your lightning wallet instantly.\n\nLet's say you want to upload more files to sell, same flow applies, just this time, rather than using website-generated key (if you want ofc), you can edit it\nand paste your previously generated key to get paid to the same key. (same account)\n\nGive it a try, suggestions are welcome.",
