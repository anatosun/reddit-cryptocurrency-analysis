Currently I am using Coinbase wallet (Hot wallet) but I will be getting a Ledger Nano X (cold wallet) for main storage or long term holding. There are many different hot wallets available so be sure to DYOR. Another hot wallet I am going to be using is MyDoge but that is for Dogecoin. A cold wallet it more secure than a hot wallet.\nIf you have funds I would suggest a cold wallet. \nLike I said DYOR. So start searching the differences between \"hot wallet\" and \" cold wallet\"\n\nEither way you go you will have to write down your seed phrase. \n1)This is your password so to speak. It is very important to never loose as it is the only one you will receive for that specific wallet. There isn't a reset password or anything like that, if you loose that seed phrase you will never be able to access the funds in that wallet. \n2) Never give out your seed phrase to anyone.\n3)Never respond to anyone from your DM's here on reddit, they are potentially scammers and target new people especially when they state they don't know how to do this or that like you have stated\n4) Never click on links here on Reddit as they can be phishing hacks. I don't click links anywhere anymore since i got into crypto because of being concerned about a hack and my crypto accounts being compromised",

Hot and cold wallets offer varying degrees of security. As hot wallets connect to the Internet, they're considered less safe compared to cold wallets that are always offline\n\nFor those who want the convenience of a hot wallet with the security of a cold one, Trust Wallet keeps most of its currency on cold storage servers. So it's like having a cold wallet as a service, as strange as that may sound.     ... Per  Google\n\nDown the road you should get a cold wallet...but at least you are NOT on the Exchanges! Bravo!!!!",

And it goes to one miner, no matter how many or how few miners there are.\n\nAnd because people don\u2019t really understand this fact, and they keep buying more and more hardware to throw at it, what happens is that the difficulty is adjusted to keep the average block times to one minute. More miners equals more difficulty equals smaller slices on average for everyone.\n\nFortunately though, Doge is mined by Litecoin pools, as a byproduct of their LTC efforts. So we don\u2019t run much of a risk of dying because everyone gave up on mining, like they did just before AuxPoW saved us from a certain death.\n\nRemember that the goal of mining is not to make you rich. It is to secure the coin by guaranteeing no one can modify the blockchain. The rewards are just an enticement to get people to do it, that\u2019s all.",
