            "selftext": "Recently found out that binance will share and provide our data to third party entities such as governments without even letting the user know if the local regulators ask ! And They won\u2019t give you any options to delete your data or your account so basically we don\u2019t have the right to delete our account and data ! Your data basically stays with them forever even if you disable the account!! So my questions is does this mean a binance account that has no longer funds but has had a history of assets and transactions be taxed even years after when the regulators have got the data from binance !? Can they be sued for such thing!? \nBasically if you have opened an account with binance you\u2019re at risk of being exposed and taxed at any time in the future as they keep our data ! Am I getting something wrong here !? I hope I am coz this is ridiculous!!",
