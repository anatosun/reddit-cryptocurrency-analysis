I basically detail how the destination they've set isn't \u201cTo the Moon\u201d as an investment vehicle but is more so \u201cThroughout the Universe\u201d based on how their projects aim to scale Dogecoin. This rap is primarily meant for casual audiences but \\*hopefully\\* anyone can enjoy...\n\nAfter watching it, what do yaw think of what I did here? Did you learn anything of value?\n\nMuch dumb? Such insightful? Very terrible? Many awesome? Such boring? Many intriguing?\n\nMuch Upvote or So Downvote?",
