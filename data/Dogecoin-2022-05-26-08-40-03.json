I will never sell, I love crypto & I love my [BTC](https://imgur.com/a/EIi0N8c)ETH but that\u2019s cause I\u2019m playing with money that means nothing to me & if you\u2019re in the same means nothing to you position than I recommend holding & getting that experience of diamond hands through the bear and even through recession but if I had anything I couldn\u2019t afford to lose invested I\u2019m closing as fast as I possibly can & im putting my own families needs over my Reddit friends. \nSeriously guys the short to mid term is showing sign of being in big trouble free fall territory. I\u2019m all for hodling & I love DOGE & the community.I have a bullish long term 5-10-20 year outlook but the short term 6 month-2 year is looking really ugly on the indicators & I know some of you are trying to HOdL your kids college fund or your wife\u2019s pension & there\u2019s nothing DOGE about that. Attached you\u2019ll see a Bitcoin chart & basically everything crypto mirrors btc & if we break that bottom level support at 26,400 ish we\u2019re gonna see a free fall of BTC down to as low as 8K-$13K",
