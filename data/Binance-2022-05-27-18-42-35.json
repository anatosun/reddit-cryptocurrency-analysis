            "selftext": "Big Thanks to u/kazooie___ for finding the solultion for [binance.com](https://binance.com) NOT BINANCE US. He deserves all credit for the solution. I just wanted to share a detailed, step-by-step guide I wish I had when I was struggling to get my 14 day pending account verified. I hope this will solve your binance problems. Tried to make it as clear as possible. \n\nBEFORE YOU READ: Understand that when DOGECOIN got hyped, binance probably got overflooded with new requests and identity verifications ALL AT ONCE. Try to keep an open mind about how this could affect servers and therefore their services (KYC). \n\n**Solution:** Binance has a costumer service that you can't find on their original website, I won't post a link so you don't have to worry that I'm posting a shady link. just google \"Binance Zendesk\". Zendesk is a tool that a lot of companies use as costumer service. I had my doubts but I have done my research and it is safe.\n\n**Step 1: Google \"binance zendesk\"**. and click on the first link.   \nIt should be https://[binance.zendesk.com](https://binance.zendesk.com)  \nAny other link could be a phising website. In this solution you will only have to give your email adresse and phone number which does not put your binance account at risk. **ALWAYS VERIFY YOUR LINKS!**\n\n**Step 2: Submit a request > Account Function**\n\n**Step 3:** **Account Function > Unable to login | Unlock Account | Account Verification**  \n(This depends, first time I did account verification and I recieved back an automatted email saying I need to verify on binance....blablabla) So I would try first with unable to login so you get a responce from a human.\n\n**Step 4: Subject >** (Post your problem) EG: \"Account has been pending for 5 days\"\n\n**Step 5:** Description >  Describe your situation in the clearest possible way. Write your email and phone number aswell so they can identify your faster (I had to reply twice because I did not add email and phonenum in description, so this can be avoided).**REMEMBER:** BE RESPECTFUL ! Remember, these are people reading and responding to YOUR EMAIL. The more respectful you are, the better costumer service you will get. They are here to find a solution to your problem. My description that seemed to work:\n\n\"Please could you verify my account?  It should have been verified by  09/02/2021 and it still seems to be pending. I have been trading over money from other exchanges that cost me quite a bit of money to transfer between accounts with fees. I have already sent all the documents necessary. Please could you validate my account or reset the verification.\"Email:  [\\*](mailto:theomilhes93@gmail.com)\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*@hotmail.comPhone number: +03 \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Thank you. \"\n\n**Step 6 & 7:** Enter your email adress and phone number in the cases.\n\n**Step 8**: Attach any picture/screenshot of your problem. I attached a screenshot of my account still pending for the 9th of feb.\n\n**Step 9:** Wait a couple of minutes / hours (depending on the requests) and you should receive an email from binance costumer service (AN ACTUAL HUMAN BEING).  The Email they sent:\n\n\"Dear user,  \nThank you for your inquiry.  \nUnfortunately we had a system issue and couldn't approved your KYC.  \nWe will reject your ID verification in the next hours, so that you can re-submit the ID document again.  \nThank you in advance for your comprehension.\u00a0\n\nPlease feel free to contact us again for further assistance.\u00a0\n\nKind regards,\u00a0Binance Support Team \"\n\n**Step 10:** Wait some time, and be patient depending on what their response mail was. Their team has proven to be respectful and so should I.After I believe 2 hours, my verification has been cancelled and I was able to re-verify my KYC.1 hour later, my pending account since 14 days has FINALLY BEEN VERIFIED !\n\nI cannot guarantee that this method will 100% solve your verification issues, but it worked for me after days of desperation. After all this please remember to always be PATIENT and RESPECTFUL. This is a rapidly growing community, and it is to be excepted that some things may not work out the first time.\n\nIf this solves your issue, please comment it down below. I would love to see if this post helped you.Thanks again to u/kazooie___ for finding an underrated solution on my original post : [https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/lhh00t/12\\_days\\_account\\_verification\\_pending\\_and\\_still/](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/lhh00t/12_days_account_verification_pending_and_still/)",

LET'S GET VERIFIED !I've been on Binance for almost 2 weeks now, I have done the verification around 12 days ago and it is still pending !  (The Pending time should've been till the 8th of february, and still no sign of life !) There is absolutely no way to reset the verification, or contact any kind of support so I'm trying here.Not being able to deposit or withdraw funds for so long considering most people/friends had their verification done in 1 hour is beyond me. (For those wondering, you cannot withdraw or deposit funds if your account verification is pending.)\n\nThis bothers me very much, having to deposit funds onto coinbase account and then transfer it to binance, I'm losing quite some money with withdraw and transferring fees and time. Please fix this, I just want to be able to fully enjoy the binance experience... Thanks.",
