All this proof of stake and L2 scaling and all those new experiments taking place might or might not fail, but everything similar to them previously failed (see banks, liberty dollar, etc) so anecdotal evidence suggests that the only safe bet is Bitcoin, on-chain, exactly as Satoshi created and left it.\n\nAdam Back and Charlie are charlatans, one is selling Liquid and rent-seeking solutions , the other just wants to copy said rent-seeking solutions like he unimaginatively copied Bitcoin. \n\nStay vigilant and good luck.",

                            "response": "> we will see the effects of fees not taking over block reward in another 4 halvings\n\nCurious, why 4 halvings exactly?   Is there some threshold that's crossed when the block rewards are 1/16th of what they are now?\n\nSeems to me that the essence of the issue is that the system is set up so that the majority of the current value of block rewards will more or less equal the cost of compute, electricity, and bandwidth needed to close that block.   Competition among miners is what drives that -- if it's cheap to close block relative to the award, more miners will pile on.  If it's expensive, miners will either shut down their rigs or use their compute for other things.  So ultimately the block reward gets converted to electricity and bandwidth and is effectively taken out of the system.\n\nThis makes the economics of mining very dependent on not just the block award but the current coin price -- how much you get for selling the mined coins.\n\nYou've put the tipping point at 4 halvings, or about 14 years from now.  I'd be worried it's much closer.  Since the price is entirely based on speculation (what people will pay) a tipping point in investor confidence could happen virtually any time, and the resulting falling price will influence miners much more quickly than an event 2, 6, 10, or 14 years away.",

Of course, this policy would only be enforced by wallets as a default setting, so it would be 100% voluntary (i.e. not included in the protocol rules).\n\nI doubt that people transferring $1,000,000 care about paying $1 (0.0001% fee) or $10 (0.001% fee) or more. Furthermore, this fee would pay for censorship-resistance: as regulations become more stringent, the risk of confirming high-value transfers will increase, and miners will want to be compensated for this.",

It's a great marketing pitch and makes it an easy sell but once the block rewards fall off to zero (or close enough to it) you either need massive fees (which is what the BTC people want) or gargantuan numbers of people transacting at all times. \n\nIt's less \"sexy\", but the kind of obvious solution that doesn't rely on charity or hopium is to just implement some form of tail emissions so that miners are guaranteed to get paid. And that seems particularly important on a chain like BCH where low-fees are a priority.",

The number of replicas can be reduced by using   replicas as witnesses that are involved in the protocol only when some full replica fails. We also believe that it is possible to reduce the number of copies of the state to     1 but the details remain to be worked out.\u201d",
