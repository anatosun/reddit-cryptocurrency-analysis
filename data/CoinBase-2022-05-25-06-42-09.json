I\u2019m having no trouble putting money in to buy more but when I try to sell, I get asked to link my bank account, even though I already have, and when I try to do it again, it says that it\u2019s already paired but still is asking for me to link my account, so I\u2019m not able to sell any of the assets I have. Any help would be appreciated",
