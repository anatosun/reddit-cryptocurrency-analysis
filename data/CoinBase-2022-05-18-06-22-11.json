A username can only be used once, even if the Wallet is deleted. This is for security reasons, as each username created is tied to its own unique 12-word recovery phrase.\nUnfortunately, the username cannot be edited. We recommend you open a new Wallet with your desired credentials.\nPlease note: Coinbase Wallet and Standalone Wallet Extension are user-controlled, non-custodial products \u2013 the recovery phrase is what gives you, and only you, complete access. For your security, Coinbase will never have access to this seed, which means we cannot access your Wallet under any circumstances.\"",
