The whole open-conversation podcast format does leave something to be desired if you want a more focused discussion. And it\u2019s still a growing art form. And omg I had to stop listening to Neil Degrass Tyson because he is the absolute worst with interrupting and not understanding his guests.",

Of course not. There is a vast difference. But is he educated enough, smart enough to connect dots, able to communicate those connections, and willing to do so? I think so. Given the anti-intellectual slant the world seems to often have (and I think is damaging in general), gatekeeping intellectualism is probably a worse answer than encouraging it. My 2c.",

There\u2019s a reason the world runs on fake money, if the gold standard returned, all big corporations would have to be honest and play mostly fair. Now why in hells name would any company or country or ruling elite or esoteric trillionaire family \u2026up and decide that all things are now backed by something they can\u2019t manipulate? And, this is not the same world as even 10 years ago.  Shiny heavy metal that\u2019s not used for much is archaic. Golds real worth per ounce based on pure building material worth is around a tenth of what it sells for -much like the DeBeers racket with diamonds,it\u2019s far overpriced and not easily used. BTC boils down to being a ledger, an incorruptible accountant. It\u2019s not about what it\u2019s worth or what kind of commodity etc, it\u2019s about it being a perfect account of who\u2019s is who\u2019s. And unless there\u2019s a global agreement to ban BTC, you can\u2019t contain it or ban it or otherwise mafia-bully it. If the world does go to gold standard, it\u2019ll be when there is only one government for the whole world and that\u2019s a long time from now.",

If you wanted 100% proof the gold you buy is real, you'd need to have it tested before you buy it and witness the test to make sure a switcharoo didn't take place, then whoever buys it off you would have to do the same. If Governments and Central Banks used it to trade, every buyer, be that country, state, bank or company would want it tested (its not like everyones trustworthy is it). Then you have the problem of transporting all that gold around the world to close out trades, this takes a lot of time and again is expensive due to security risks. Bitcoin on the other hand is verified quickly on the block chain via the nodes therefor authenticity is never ever in doubt. It can be stored for almost no fee and sent across the world instantly for very very little cost. Billion dollar transactions can be sent across the world instantly for a few cent. This is not possible with gold. This is why BTC is likely to be adopted as an international payment system. There is still a place for gold but with a technology like BTC, gold is not favourable anymore. Add BTC's absolute scarcity compared to golds 2% inflation per year from mining and you start to get the picture.....Its what bitcoin can do.",

The production rate of Bitcoin halved in 2020. Therefore, the cost of producing Bitcoins is higher. Miners produce new Bitcoins, and they can't produce 1 new Bitcoin for 10k anymore. Miners won't sell the new Bitcoins below the cost of production, because they would lose money. That's the real answer. That and tether printing (which is artificial inflation, not fundamentals).",

As a currency the value is compared to other items, goods and services and other currencies. And ultimately it comes down to trust by people who use hold or want it. People trust it a lot more.",

If volatility continues it will be a way to put a play on expected market volatility or something. I wish it would work out, but the problem is it has no champion. If Russia and China were behind it, great. Even the US with all its problems would be a huge positive. But no government wants it except for tiny ones.",
