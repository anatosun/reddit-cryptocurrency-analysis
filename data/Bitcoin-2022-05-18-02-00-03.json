Two users create a dynamic smart contract using a bitcoin utxo, that allows them to shift balance between the two of them within the smart contract. This allows for instant payments that can later be settled to the blockchain. Lightning Network is a mesh network of these contracts that creates an instant bitcoin payment network.",
