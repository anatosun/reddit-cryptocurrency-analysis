I am not a techie, so haven't read the white paper. I know what mining is, on a very high level - about nonce, missing bit and machines trying to figure it out to add next block to the block chain and earn btc reward. That's it, I can't explain anything more about it. I know these machines are called nodes and it is spread across the globe which protects the bitcoin network. I know bitcoin network was never hacked in the last 12+ years and it is only increasingly getting difficult to hack in future too. I know future quantum computers can break crypto algorithm/hashkeys but it is quite far away and this is a risk for all banking and other regular finance sector too so not a btc specific concern. I know I need to keep my coins in self custody, preferably in a hardware wallet and not rely on exchanges or online platforms (like celcius/nexo) to store the coins. I know how to safeguard the 24 words. I know governments can take drastic steps one day and even arrest btc holders (it already happened in china). I know BTC started as a currency but it is predominantly used a store of value today (like gold). I know even in few decades it may or may not become a currency used to do day to day transactions but will definitely continue as a store of value and may even become a reserve currency for few countries. \n\nThat's all I know. Do I know enough? Can I continue to invest in BTC with just this knowledge?",

If you have more stable goivernment and local currency, then you will most likely use Bitcoin more as an investment or savings account.

For most of that time, there has been strong financial incentive to attack the Bitcoin network, to either expose a flaw or to force through an invalid transaction. Such attacks have never succeeded.  Regardless of technical details, I for one am pretty confident that if Bitcoin were flawed, that flaw would have been exposed by now.  TerraLuna had only been around for a couple of years, and only really became popular within the last few months.  It was untested.  Bitcoin isn't.",
