Brawn has always won in human society with just enough brain to know how to use it. Only since the 20th century has brain been slowing coming out on top, but it still needs the brawn to do the heavy lifting. i doubt any inventor of any high powered weapon would have the strength of arms to move even the smallest of equipment. The brawn you have to have just to load a ballistic round into a mortar is staggering compared to anything most scientists or inventors have ever had to experience and until they invent power armor (which is in the works) and other augmenting suits/equipment and can mass produce it, brawn is still king.",

It's about removing liability from the intermediate banks and allowing them to offload that liability onto government, and then proceed with better overhead with no other structural changes to Canadian banking corporate dominance. It is another subtle form of corporate welfare, only this time it is lowering corporate liability rather than boosting returns...but same difference to banks' bottom line when risk-adjusted.  \n>  \n>They like to sell it as if it lowers personal credit and liquidity risk...but the government knows way more about citizens than the bank is allowed to, and if they know about a risk the bank normally would not (like the moment you apply for EI) then they will act on those risks and call personal liability and limit liquidity to save the bottom line...because you can guarantee this guy is not using it as a quick seamless transition into a basic minimum income social safety net\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe're gonna get the CBDC. If this is where people are at, then the government is going to be allowed to shoot themselves in the foot pursuing this central bank shitcoin instead of adapting to Bitcoin.\n\nCountries that adopt early will benefit immensely.
