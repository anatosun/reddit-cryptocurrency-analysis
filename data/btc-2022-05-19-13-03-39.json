We are building a product on SLP NFTs and it sucks that Roger goes through these ebbs and flows of faith, I can't imagine what it would be like to be in his shoes, but although Bitcoin.com is biggest BCH influence, we will continue working on supporting Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. I like SmartBCH, but unless they are launching a more advanced scalable sidechain (like Tezos for instance), its a nice to have functionality on Bitcoin Cash.\n\nBitcoin Core Maximalism at this point is purely a faith based investment movement (they even act like zealots) because their technology cannot match up to competition, so they must bridge this gap with faith. Bitcoin Cash, with its better UX and continuous upgrades is playing catch up on some aspects (like NFTs, Smart Contracts, DeFi) but leading on others (merchant adoption), and I appreciate that at least Bitcoin.com is focused on merchant adoption. I still watch /u/mafalzon (Marc Falzon's) videos on adoption everyday with lunch and its one of the best part of my day.",

People used to talk about the \"tokambrian explosion\" and how every type of asset was going to be tokenised and traded on chain. But increasingly I think this is misguided.\n\nSay I tokenised a bunch of gold coins. I can trustlessly transfer the tokens to you, but you still have to trust that I will actually redeem the tokens for coins. So the element of trust in a counter-party is not actually removed.\n\nIf trust is not removed from the transaction, then what's the point of having it on a distributed ledger? It's much faster and cheaper to track ownership with a centralised database. If you trust me to redeem the physical metal, then you might as well also trust me to keep the ownership logs.\n\nOr what about in-game assets in a video game? They are useless if you don't trust the game creators to redeem the tokens in the game. And if you trust the game creators, then you might as well trust them to maintain the records of players' inventories.\n\nThis seems to be true for any asset that is exogenous to the decentralised network. Which leads me to conclude that tokens are largely pointless.\n\nWould be glad for someone to tell me what I am missing.",

Which leads me to conclude that tokens are largely pointless.\n\nYou're right. Any asset which is exogenous to the blockchain cannot be that well controlled by the blockchain, but there is one thing which isn't tangible but when derived from blockchain or non-blockchain system creates a big difference.\n\n- Centralized system: You are not going to scam me because I will (worst case scenario) file a report with the police, take you to court, and even if you were a citizen of another country, get you extradited (etc). The trust is top down.\n- Blockchain system: You are not going to scam me, because the setup in which we are going to interact (escrow, smart contracts, tokens etc) will ensure that you will lose more than you gain. (YET TO BE BUILT). The trust is built bottom up.\n\nIn other words, using blockchain, we don't need the authority of the king/supreme court/republic/united nations, in order to successfully interact with each other. That system is still in the process of being built, and tokens seem to be an important building block for that.\n\nA use case: Banks using clearinghouses to deal with each other. Why do they need clearinghouses? Because there are too many parties and not everyone has enough trust, PLUS with large amounts they don't want to get tied up in dispute resolution. So they trust a clearinghouse instead.\n\nWith blockchains they can perform the clearing in a far shorter amount of time, and tokens is just how they will do it.",

Until then SmartBCH is a much better and scalable approach than SLP.",

Also, the PSF-Indexer came about because the old SLPDB indexer, which is used in almost every single SLP-supporting app, was so bloated by all of the FLEX SLP transactions. IIRC, one of the core reasons for this bloat was the fact that the original BitDB (from which SLPDB forked from) was due to the indexer using MongoDB, which apparently did not perform well at the large scales. I know that the PSF-Indexer is currently using LevelDB, which is suppose to have better scaling capabilities.",
