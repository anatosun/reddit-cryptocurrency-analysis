My account is at maximum level, therefore I have already provided my ID. Is this email a scam, or did you somehow lose my ID verification documents? I couldn't find proper information whether this email is a scam or not. Also, I can't use your in-app support because when I request the confirmation email code to be able to send the message, no email arrives and I've been waiting for over half an hour. Considering that the code is only valid for 15 minutes, that's just a horrible thing to see in the internet in year 2022.",

If this request shows up in the app, I would likely follow up on it, but not through emails that can easily be scam.",

Is a difficult choice, but the safest is to drop entirely coinbase, as seems to be very risky from a security point a view. Coinbase should have a fast mechanism to verify phishing emails.
