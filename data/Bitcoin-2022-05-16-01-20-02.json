Wallet backups were also more complicated (you had to periodically create a new backup if you were doing regular transactions).\n\nWhere previously the loss of 100 or even 1000 BTC would be met with a shrug, nowadays the potential loss of a single BTC warrants serious recovery attempts. The rate of Bitcoin being lost is certainly far, far lower than what it was in the early days.\n\nSo arguing against self custody because people didn't care back when the coin was (almost) worthless is a bad argument.",

Horror stories of customer support abound on all the exchanges.  Being unable to withdraw non-trivial amounts without photo ID and supporting documents.  Frozen assets.  Etc.  This is what BTC was designed to circumvent.  Self-custody is a requirement for that.\n\nSo when a prominent member of the space specifically says self-custody is shite, he may not be *saying* that you should gamble, but he's telling you to move in to the casino hotel and have a few drinks on the house.",
