We have 5000 years of monetary history using the gold standard to attest to and especilly from 1800-1970s. Bitcoin is actually even worse because of its hard cap. Making it even more unusable as currency and unusable as standard for an economy because an economy grows. Like how people are born and die everyday but population keeps growing, new businesses rize/fall but wealth keeps growing, such is the way of the global economy. It will forever keep growing. Even worse than gold it will never be able to sustain and meet economical obligations. But it did introduce the decentralized concept of money and that is what the world trully needs. But it's not money, it's a speculative asset. Scarcity based assets are at its core pyramid schemes. \n\nNow money, Fiat currency, is a long con ponzi scheme as it follows the growth of the economy and sustain economical obligation. New money NEEDS to be pumped in. The main issue with it is that it's controlled by banks and governments. They choose to issue more or less $ whenever they want to and feel like it for whatever reason. \n\nNow here's where dogecoin comes in and accidentally hits the sweet spot. Unlimited supply is the wrong word. Limited/locked growth=dis-inflation is the correct term. Yes it will grow forever(so will the economy and population) but the main point is to have that growth limited and out of any 1 entity or a groups control because then it becomes unlimited supply pretty quickly. They can choose to issue as much as they want whenever they want. With a limited/locked supply growth the percentage inflation rate will forever be decreasing. So it's able to sustain economical growth/ obligations and be a better store of value. This supply growth fixes several things, people die/born everyday, supply is lost everyday, cost of mining goes down keeping mining from becoming centralized and anyone can mine, the more miners the better, fees are kept low and can go even lower, encourages spending giving it utility as currency and at the same time being an excellent store of value as the economy is bigger than any scarcity based asset. The currency should be the ultimate store of value. All of this in a layer 1 solution. \n\nI swear, listen to what elon says about dogecoin, the guy not only knows money he understands how it actually works. And it's ironic that a decentralized coin with a dog on it has this kind of setup.",
