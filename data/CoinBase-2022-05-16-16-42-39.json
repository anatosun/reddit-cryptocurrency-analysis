They barely know how to move the photos from their picnic they took last week.\n\nOr worse still, they get a real virus/malware and the funds that are \"just being held\" in the little program wallet are siphoned out without them even knowing it.\n\nMajority of people are not going to get unplugged from the old system. The only way forward is for the banks to add the crypto wallets so you can hold your dollars alongside your Bitcoin with your bank. That is what global adoption will look like. People like you and I will have our own bank, on our own terms, but the vast majority will not want to do this.\n\nEdit: Unfortunately, now I see this is some shilling for LOOPRING. lmao. Oh well.
