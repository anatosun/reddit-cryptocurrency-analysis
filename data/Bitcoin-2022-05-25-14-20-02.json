I thought it was one of the more interesting episodes with a heavy dose of philosophy. \n\nHowever, I was dumbfounded when host Peter McCormack mentioned multiple times that even though he\u2019s been in the game for years he still has no meaningful gains to speak of. \n\nHow is that possible? Shouldn\u2019t everyone who got in before 2020 at least be well into the black? \n\nAgain, great episode just really perplexed by that statement. Thoughts?",
