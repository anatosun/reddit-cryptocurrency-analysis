But now NFT sales are down 92% from their peak last September.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHalf of the users are concerned about rising mortgage rates and market corrections, and the other half are aiming for lower NFT prices to snatch the coolest CryptoPunk with discount. \n\nI took advantage of the low fee on ETH chain on May 17 and bought CoolCats NFT with 3x leverage on WOWswap for $37 and 24 hours later I made x6 on that trade. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on my outburst of emotion, my question remains unavoidable. Has the NFT market really stopped holding its punch? \n\nI'm thinking of buying the fractional part of BAYS. This project keeps going strong, which bribes me to make this trade.",
