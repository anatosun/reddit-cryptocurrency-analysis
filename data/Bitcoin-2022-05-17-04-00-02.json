Suddenly some old whales find their keys again and 500k comes back into circulation. That would suddenly dump the bitcoin price, or atleast temporarily. \n\nAlso your assumption that people assume more is in circulation doesn't matter. The coins not being in circulation would automatically be priced in because of the lower supply.\n\nLastly to use your gold argument against you. If you have a 10k pound gold supply. 1k gets lost forever, thus making the remaining 9k more scarce and more valuable. This has happened and is priced in, but remember from this point we're still mining and increasing the supply. The 9k there is left will be inflated.",
