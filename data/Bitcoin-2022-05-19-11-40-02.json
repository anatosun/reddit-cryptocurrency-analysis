Preferably in The Netherlands / Europe.\n\nOver the last few years I have been following and researching Bitcoin, today during a walk I thought, why not try and find a company that would employ an enthousiast (without any software skills). I can imagine there would be companies that employ people to try and expand the Bitcoin economy by getting more and more companies and merchants to accept bitcoin payments. \n\nThanks in advance",

There is no \"Bitcoin\" except your own copy of the Bitcoin blockchain on your own Bitcoin node. This is the true security in the node network. You can trust your own node, and you can only trust your own node  \n\nBitcoin is secure because the node network converges on a single transaction history in spite of every node being independent. A supermajority of nodes discovers the same truth. This supermajority is not numeric, not countable. It exists or not, depending on each participant's frame of reference. If I spend Bitcoin to buy something, the transaction can only succeed if the merchant has the same transaction history on his node as I have on my node. In the context of that transaction, success is a supermajority of our two nodes  \n\nOn the other side, Bitcoin is a networked system with the propagation latency that is present in any networked system. The purpose of mining is to create a delay between blocks (average 10 minutes), so that nodes have enough time to stay synchronized  \n\nOccasionally, two miners win the mining race at the same time, creating a chain tip fork. The fork is resolved node by node when the next block arrives. If my node receives a block which doesn't link to my previous block, then my previous block becomes a stale fork tip block and gets replaced. This happens automatically - every node follows the longest chain  \n\nA so-called \"51% attack\" occurs when a miner or conspiracy of miners controls enough hash power to create a deliberate chain tip fork. The nodes follow the longest chain. The attacker's chain is the valid chain. This is not an attack on Bitcoin. If it is an attack - because of a double spend fraud - the victim is the recipient of the coin which exists in a stale tip block, if that recipient provided valuable goods or services before losing the coin in the replacement chain tip  \n\nA 51% attack is not a catastrophe",

So if I receive a payment, and I see it confirmed in a block on my node, then I know that payment and all the payments in its ancestry \u2014 going back to when those coins were mined \u2014 are valid based on the rules my node is enforcing. So if a miner mines a block with \u201cinvalid\u201d transactions (as defined by my node), and then tries to send me coins in that block or with coined mined in that block, then my node will reject them. The miner will say \u201chey, I sent you money\u201d and I\u2019ll say \u201cno you didn\u2019t\u201d. Running a node protects the nodes owner from receiving invalid coins. \n\nThis is why when people talk about user consensus, they talk about \u201cthe majority of economic nodes\u201d. Nodes don\u2019t vote, the validate. So the thing that prevents a miner from mining invalid blocks is that if most of the network won\u2019t accept it, then there are fewer people willing to buy those coins, and they are worth less.",

And god help whoever paid you fiat for it they have nothing now.\n\nRunning a full node validates the ledger. \n\nFirst nodes check all previous blocks up the chain, making sure they are all proper and correct hashes.  Also logging and adding in every transaction to make a database.\n\nAfter that it waits for new blocks to do the same.  A block with a correct hash is added onto the chain.  In the background if it's not correct you are probably blacklisting that IP to not waste your time anymore.\n\nIt's also broadcasting the blocks and transactions to other nodes, and communicating to get the same.\n\nThis is the extra security you personally get as a node.  \n\nYou can post your transactions with others your node is communicating, obfuscating it's origin.\n\nAlso validating blocks yourself so you cannot be defrauded.\n\nIn the Satoshi times BTC Core did all of this.  It mined, it was a node, and your wallet.",
