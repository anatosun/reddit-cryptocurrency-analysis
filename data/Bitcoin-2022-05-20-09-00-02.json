Then a couple other people were commenting about how kucoin has these in-house traders working against public traders but with all the back-end data to give them an advantage. Supposedly they're able to manipulate the buying patterns on their exchange in a way that makes it appear as legitimate losses.\n\nOn another site most of the people said there were no problems other than a couple people said they were suspicious but didn't make any specific accusations.\n\nHas anybody here had problems with them?\n\n*Additional*\nI'm already assuming most people probably didn't notice any significant issues because otherwise they wouldn't still be in business. I'm curious about the ones who had bad experiences to find out how bad they were and what it was that happened.\n\nI'm probably showing my age a bit here but it's like how most people who owned a Samsung Galaxy S7 didn't notice any problems with their phones but some people's phones randomly spontaneously combusted. If it has a chance of spontaneously combusting that's the important part to me. I hope that makes sense.",

Anecdotally some people may of lost money with kucoin or lost access to an account but that will happen with any exchange.\n\nMy personal experience with them is using a non kyc account to trade, it took like 16 hours to be credited to my account which was absurd considering they were supposed to credit my account after a certain amount of network confirmations or something (like 10/15 minutes max) but the trade went through straight away once my account was credited and the withdrawal was processed in a very amicable timeframe.\n\nOverall I'd give them like a 6/7 out of 10 based on my own experience.",

Rumor is they'll integrate with Square by levering BTCPayserver, LNURL, hard wallet support, third party NFC debit cards (like Bolt Card), along with an \\[optional\\] mining pool for their open-source ASIC, will design their own app for nodes, and have a secret project that TBD is working on.
