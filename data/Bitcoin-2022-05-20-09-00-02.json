Then a couple other people were commenting about how kucoin has these in-house traders working against public traders but with all the back-end data to give them an advantage. Supposedly they're able to manipulate the buying patterns on their exchange in a way that makes it appear as legitimate losses.\n\nOn another site most of the people said there were no problems other than a couple people said they were suspicious but didn't make any specific accusations.\n\nHas anybody here had problems with them?\n\n*Additional*\nI'm already assuming most people probably didn't notice any significant issues because otherwise they wouldn't still be in business. I'm curious about the ones who had bad experiences to find out how bad they were and what it was that happened.\n\nI'm probably showing my age a bit here but it's like how most people who owned a Samsung Galaxy S7 didn't notice any problems with their phones but some people's phones randomly spontaneously combusted. If it has a chance of spontaneously combusting that's the important part to me. I hope that makes sense.",

Anecdotally some people may of lost money with kucoin or lost access to an account but that will happen with any exchange.\n\nMy personal experience with them is using a non kyc account to trade, it took like 16 hours to be credited to my account which was absurd considering they were supposed to credit my account after a certain amount of network confirmations or something (like 10/15 minutes max) but the trade went through straight away once my account was credited and the withdrawal was processed in a very amicable timeframe.\n\nOverall I'd give them like a 6/7 out of 10 based on my own experience.",

I believe they already possess the absolute best do-it-all financial app in the world (CashApp) by a mile, which has all the licenses, a massive network effect, is bitcoin only in the crypto space, integrated the LN before anyone, have stocks and partial stocks you can buy/send, include a bank account, have Cashtags, tax software. Rumor is they'll integrate with Square by levering BTCPayserver, LNURL, hard wallet support, third party NFC debit cards (like Bolt Card), along with an \\[optional\\] mining pool for their open-source ASIC, will design their own app for nodes, and have a secret project that TBD is working on. This is a company I want to own shares in, trust, and I believe deserves the full backing of the bitcoin community, from maxi to pleb. CashApp + Hard wallets or NFC LN cards=**ENDGAME.** Everyone has to follow, from Apple Pay to Chase, or get run over.",

There will be plenty of centralized entities trying to exploit it, Block however, looks to set an early precedent for them all with open source everything (ASIC, Hard Wallet, DEX, etc). This is really important, like the battle for the internet once it started catching on in the late 80s. Unfortunately though, Cisco, Microsoft, et al, drew first blood, and decided software licenses and protected IP were better than open source. Bitcoin is a little different of course, but what's cool about it is that the technology surrounding it will always trend towards its cost of production as information--which is close to zero. That's how we get an over abundance of free software wallets, the LN, etc. So trying to build a shareholder environment around BTC doesn't actually work over the longterm, unless you are actively providing value for the network (mining, silicon, energy, hardware wallets, node software, nodes, DEX, etc), instead of trying to exploit the deflation of the money. I think Jack and Block are important. What say you about this argument?",
