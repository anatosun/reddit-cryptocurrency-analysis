To those stating the wallet address that sends the last transaction to the Binance cold wallet:\n\nThe \"As\" at the end of this address was unintentional and was supposed to be spaced to continue my sentence.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6305s01yja091.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=e51a0419ef40fb80d888e8c56a4b1f7a10d2ae7a\n\n\\#2. To those stating that a Binance cold wallet can be a long-standing wallet holding assets from trades on Binance, now in posession of Binance\u2014 Cold wallets can always be bestowed to user's on Binance so it's 50/50.

An Exchange that is no longer supported in South Korea unless you obviously don't disclose your identity and use a VPN.

We now know that more than half of the BTC that is now in this cold-wallet is heavily tied to a wallet address on OkEx, which is banned in South Korea since 04/07/2021 due to consistent money-laundering issues observed by South Korean Financial Intelligence Units. Again, none of this was mentioned by Luna Guard Foundation. Why is BTC going to and from OkEx?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Note: I have little time to review this before I post but want to get it out there as time feels pressing with the fork coming up. Rushing out and won't be on my PC until later tonight/tomorrow. Feel free to point out any errors and please make as many observations possible and highlight any information that could bring interesting discussion about what's going on here.

Took out some I\u2019m guessing massively leveraged short positions on probably Luna, ust if possible, but def on btc. \n\nThey offered do kwan 25,000 btc to buy ust. He obliged, dark pool, so as not to mess up the peg. That was about $1billion at the time if I\u2019m not mistaken. Supposedly under the pretense of investing it in Luna and it\u2019s liquidity pools. \n\nThen shitadel dumped the ust, on the market breaking the peg, causing Luna to break along with all its liquidity for all tokens on chain, including pegged tokens. Then they dumped the 50k btc on the market cheap, causing massive crash and market sell off. I believe other chains were attacked other ways during this time too. If I\u2019m not mistaken Solana suffered an spam outage/slowdown, and so did some smaller chains. This, combined with the stock market sell off, inflation fears, and recession fears, cause a panic sell off of btc and all crypto along with it. \n\nShitadel most likely closed their shorts right at the bottom, thereby creating the bottom  and paid back the loan at this point since btc had fallen almost 30% since they attacked it. The borrowed btc alone would have made them nearly a billion in profit at $25k btc price. Since the btc was borrowed, as long as they can buy it back cheaper than they sold it for, they\u2019re good. Plus leveraged shorts for the attack you knew you were committing\u2026 that could be the real money. That is, if this is the bottom. Charts looking awfully bearish right now and another leg down wouldn\u2019t surprise me in the least. I can see $18k btc price in the cards, and who knows. In my experience the bears push it lower than I can imagine every single time. So maybe 12? 8? Lol. Hopefully I can leverage to the tits as soon as it starts to come back lol.",

                            "response": "Ok, so.\n\n\nDo you remember when I said it was strange that we were starting off at 70k and ending at 90k?\n\nWe were working with two withdrawals for 28,250 BTC and 42,530 BTC from the Luna Foundation Guard wallet.\n\nLast time I assumed the two met at the second to last wallet before finally being transferred to the final wallet. BUT, as someone pointed out you can\u2019t really just throw them together and assume since one of the deposits for the the 28,250 BTC(27,139 BTC after all the fees) was actually from January (My mistake)\n\nThat means that that is not the same 28K bitcoin we were following earlier, it couldn\u2019t be because it was from almost 5 months ago. When backtracking and going down the second rabbit-hole properly for the 28k BTC I find that the 28k was withdrawn from the second to last wallet on 05/10 to the cold wallet, BUT when looking at the final cold wallet I couldn\u2019t find the 28K bitcoin deposit.\n\nThe reason for this is because I was looking for a 28k deposit when in fact it became a 41k deposit in the same block through a different taxation. I\u2019ll give you that the picture is small and it\u2019s confusing to understand (I stared at it for a few minutes myself), but that\u2019s what happened with the 28k on 05/10. It converged with a 19k deposit of BTC.\n\nWe still have the same two withdrawals from LFG wallet to account for, and now what we thought was the 42,530 BTC being deposited after fees was actually the 28,250 BTC converging with 19,006 BTC.\n\nTHEN, I had to go back and find out what happened with the 42,530 BTC that was withdrawn and I found it was split into two wallets. 30K exactly went to a wallet on the **OKEx exchange** and 12,530K went back to Luna Foundation Guard wallet. I have no idea what kind of method he used to do this but i know for sure there are coin tornado esque apps that can split and converge deposits/withdrawals to multiple wallets at once.\n\nLastly, at the very bottom you see two chains of wallet addresses originating from the OkEx wallet we\u2019ve now discovered involved in all the transactions (1st wallet chain) and the LFG wallet (2nd wallet chain) revealing the associated BTC volume shared by all wallets in that chain. The end result shows two matching totals that add up to the 91,000 BTC that finally landed in the cold wallet.\n\nThe reason only 70k left and we ended up with 90k is because there was a third wallet in play. The funds on this third wallet originate from OkEx. For whatever reason he wanted it off OkEx and in the Binance cold wallet, along with the rest of \u201cLFG reserves\u201d There\u2019s no proof UST was ever purchased because all the bitcoin that should/would have been used is sitting in eerily similar pile conveniently in a cold wallet on Binance.",

LFG withdrew their BTC to various centralized exchanges to try and defend the peg, decided they no longer wanted to defend the peg, received 10k EXTRA BTC after literally doing nothing, then decided for some reason to move ALL their funds to ONE publicly known Binance cold wallet instead of split into random unknown accounts that would be much harder to trace and pinpoint. The entire proposition of your story is absurd.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> BUT, as someone pointed out you can\u2019t really just throw them together and assume since one of the deposits for the the 28,250 BTC(27,139 BTC after all the fees)\n\nHow in the world do you rack up 1000+ BTC in transfer fees. Look at the transaction fees, they are minimal. To equate 28,250 BTC with 27,139 BTC \"after fees\" is ridiculous. They are obviously two different batches of BTC.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We still have the same two withdrawals from LFG wallet to account for, and now what we thought was the 42,530 BTC being deposited after fees was actually the 28,250 BTC converging with 19,006 BTC.\n\nYou forget that another \\~5000 BTC was withdrawn to get the final amount of 42,530 because 28,250 + 19,006 does not equal 42,530. So who does the extra 5000 BTC belong to then?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Lastly, at the very bottom you see two chains of wallet addresses originating from the OkEx wallet we\u2019ve now discovered involved in all the transactions (1st wallet chain) and the LFG wallet (2nd wallet chain) revealing the associated BTC volume shared by all wallets in that chain. The end result shows two matching totals that add up to the 91,000 BTC that finally landed in the cold wallet.\n\nThis part is just incoherent. Link the exact transactions showing the BTC moved from OKex wallet to Binance. The only incoming transactions in May shows 41229 BTC and 6268 BTC, a far cry from the 90k left in the wallet. The rest was already deposited in the wallet BEFORE May which means THEY ARE NOT LFG's BTC. Furthermore another transaction in May shows a 25k WITHDRAWAL that you conveniently omit from your posts. Is it possible some of this BTC came from LFG, yes. Is it true that all 90k belongs to LFG? No, that's ridiculous. \n\nI respond to some of your other mischaracterizations here.

Regarding the sale of BTC \u201cto buy UST\u201d, the first purchase took place on 8th of May, technically the bar doesn\u2019t show any particular volume change. The increase in volume in that bar was due to the break of the \u201c34413$\u201d support, each bar that breaks a support has an increasing volume due to Stop Loss execution. The next chart shows the normal volume on both volume profile and classic volume for that date:\r  \n\r  \n[Image 1](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/E3ZuHu7YwofIemlk0RmuWwOxXhclJlmDDMvA95Qnd71TVdawg94MouJ3HjMwnsGFMv8EZ408o1MEC0ZIdF4l6royoCAoPpPhk3713faeHqbVnk4OtzusUHqGCHDLCdBuVzZmcoIANum0hl9cwA)\n\n\r  \nSelling 80 000 BTC within 2 days from a single part should make a significant drop in the chart, yet in May 8 and 10 the total amount of BTC sold worldwide in every exchange was 199.65k BTC, LFG has stated that they have sold half of that volume.\r  \n\r  \nThe selling volume on May 8 on all exchanges was 62.02k BTC, the previous days, the volume was 56.4k, 73.77k, and 45.17k. Therefore, there was no increase in volume, which represents a sell of 50k BTC from a single account.

The following charts compare both drops:\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n[Image 4](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/h2FCiRkVNgsRRsPLVyNcNEba8dvXrzOCDnp5jTnFew_HfO8aBvKabsbaURmJI0l90djs7odvq_wTjC7lUGeuKsA2kVefsur8z__zL6F5RWtH8jDB4MvLvUeKFxmSmnXV2v4wtYp3H8IlxJi7aw)\r  \nIn conclusion, the technical analysis and volume do not show massive buying in UST or a huge BTC selling.",
