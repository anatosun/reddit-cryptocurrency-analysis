If UST is doing really well, LUNA also does well. However, when confidence in UST falters, so too does confidence in LUNA and the market cap will plummet as mass selloffs begin. Due to the redemption mechanism where LUNA is minted when UST is burned, this results in a hyperinflationary death spiral. \n\nThere was a nominal $27B market cap for LUNA before the de-peg, but in reality there was only a small fraction of that in real, accessible liquidity. DAI and LUSD are backed by ETH (and other things for DAI) which has much deeper liquidity and a market cap orders of magnitude higher than the circulating supply of DAI or LUSD. Confidence in ETH also isn't related to confidence in LUSD or DAI. \n\nFRAX is a little different and is attempting to create a \"fractional reserve algorithmic stablecoin\" where there is significant \"firm\" USDC backing and then a portion of backing from FXS. It's a much more conservative approach to what UST was trying to do, with much better backing. Approach with caution, but I have more confidence in FRAX's approach than UST's.",
