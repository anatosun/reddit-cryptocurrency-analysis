When you go outside of the more traditional chains and into other ecosystems, you'll see less price correlation.\n\nSolana, Cosmos, Luna, ADA, etc, those are all way less related in price than Eth, for example. And even Doge, during bull markets, doesn't show that much relationship, but as BTC grows in dominance (and with Bitcoin growing closer and closer to the stock market movements), it will trickle down on the most well established cryptos.\n\nBut even less related cryptos will always have their price action affected by BTC big movements, because that's where the big VCs and investing companies dwell in, and where many keep their \"savings\". That's why sometimes when BTC drops, on the 1 second charts, you'll see all the charts moving with big red candles at the same time; algos do those flows instantly with billions of $.\n\nOne thing that currently happens is that bull market = alt market and bear market = store of value, as it's the best way to get profits and then fight inflation/have less risk. You can check this very easily with market flows and average BTC per holder. As BTC grows, so does the correlation between charts, as people escape alts into BTC.\n\nWhat you just posted is quite common sense and a very well known structure. Unlike what many will say, market manipulation, it's more the normal market behaviour and quite predictable; the same as the inverse relationship between gold and SP&500 - when stocks are bad, gold is good and stocks good, gold bad, meaning that it usually averages out as a 0 correlation between them.",
