Maybe it\u2019s just for day traders but even so, if TA was accurate every investor would be making millions. Also how does TA predict when bulls and whales are buying and when bears are selling? Wouldn\u2019t everyone be able to play the market and be profitable if TA worked? Disclaimer, I don\u2019t know much but ik a lot of people that talk about it and they are usually wrong.",

Problem is that many sources of TA come from influencers who benefit more from telling you the price is going to $100k rather than $30k. TA is analyzing current trends and comparing them to how the market reacted in past history. Just don\u2019t watch the people who are playing guessing games. I like BC Backer, but many don\u2019t because he has been telling us that $69k was the top for months.",
