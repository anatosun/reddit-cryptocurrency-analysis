It involves holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the security and operations of a blockchain network. Simply put, staking is the act of locking cryptocurrencies to receive rewards.\n\nThe APY is a projection based on the rewards we have historically received (\u201cStaking Rewards Rate\u201d) from the applicable asset protocol. This rate is set by the applicable blockchain protocol, and is neither controlled, influenced, nor determined by Binance Staking and will change (and thus, the APY will change dynamically). Each blockchain sets its underlying rewards rate depending on various factors. The APY may be adjusted to account for funds we hold back from staking as part of our liquidity reserve, if applicable. The 80% or 120% you see it an estimated APY, but may also be lower than that because the APY will be adjusted accordingly.\n\nIf you would like to learn more information about staking and Binance earn, kindly refer to the below link [https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-staking](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-staking) \n\n[https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/650826666c344c15a062932983a38c2e](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/650826666c344c15a062932983a38c2e)\n\nhttps://academy.binance.com/en/articles/your-guide-to-binance-earn\n\nPlease contact our live support via https://www.binance.com/en/chat if you have any questions  or inquiries, we are more than happy to assist you.
