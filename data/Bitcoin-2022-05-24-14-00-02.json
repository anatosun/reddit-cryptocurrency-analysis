This is not the case. The Emergencies Act replaced the War Measures Act specifically to maintain compliance with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (ie it doesn\u2019t actually infringe on anyone\u2019s charter rights). As for \u201ccalling in the army\u201d that is covered under the National Defence Act Part VI Section 275 and is very clear on two things. First the federal government can not make that decision it must be at the request of the attorney general of a province as defined by section 274 (ie even if Trudeau wanted too he could not send in the military unless asked too). Secondly, if the military is called out they act as constables to enforce civil law (Section 282), therefore under no point is civil law or rights suspended. Canada has no clear legal mechanism to enact martial law. This is not martial law.",

So I wouldn't really criticize someone for calling it that. However I think it'd be more accurate to call it \"medical fascism\" rather than old fashioned fascism which has other implications.

I will not cash out for fiat however I do see myself actually USING the network to purchase things for myself. Till then, I am not EVER going to cash for fiat, and todays actions by Canadian government have made my resolve even stronger.\n\nI do not think this is fascism, I do think this is an over reaction of the government and the precedents set today can very well lead to similar totalitaristc governments such as the ones in Nazi Germany. \n\nI also agree with the general message of the truckers. \n\nI think that COVID has been used as a political tool and at this point the measures and mandates do not make sense from a science perspective. I do not believe that we are at this point in the pandemic saving any significant lives by keeping these measures and in fact I believe that we are harming more than saving. I believe people are loosing their jobs and lively hoods, addictions and overdoses are skyrocketing, the mental health and obesity is at its worst, the children that were young and needed to socialize in their early years will probably have lasting effects from this and the list goes on.\n\n[This interview with Brian Peckford, the last living first minister that has participated and signed the Charter Of Rights and freedoms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdhFuMDLBDM) is eye opening and very well articulated of my grievances. I know that JP is a very controversial person, but in this interview he is very concise and the content is solid.\n\nI am scared that we are giving into fear and panic ( or the media is convincing people) to the point that we are allowing the governments to erode our rights and freedoms unnecessarily.\n\nI support the peaceful protests that truckers set out to do. I watched this turn from a fringe minority to an emergency act real quick. I have seen in real time the slandering from the media and fabrications while also being able to see live feeds that disprove the narratives.\n\nHowever, I also think that the truckers are in the wrong on two main points:\n\n1. Blocking Borders\n2. Honking \n\nI agreed with the message of the last years BLM protests BUT I was not a fan when they started rioting and looting, destroying public property etc. In the same way I am not in favour of truckers blocking the border, tanking the economy and encroaching on other peoples livelihoods by disturbing the supply chain. I do not think it is act of terrorism but I do not also agree with it. Even though I support the message and I think it was very effective to get the governments attention, doing it for such a prolonged time, they are not in the right there.\n\nThe second, honking, it was funny at first. However, they are essentially harassing the residents from Ottawa for no reason. I can understand making noise for a bit during the day, but the truck horns are LOUD. Onto of that they were going to far by bringing train horns on the back of their pickups. That is just straight up unbearable and doing it 24/7 is just going to get people angry and rightfully so.\n\nWith all this being said, I do not think they are at the level of disturbance as last years BLM protests. I do not think that this was justifiable to use the emergency act and this sets a horrible precedent for future bad actors to use it for any \"emergency\" they see fit. \n\nAs others have pointed out, people are selfish. When they see their \"enemies\" or people they do not agree with politically be squeezed by the government they cheer and are happy, not realizing at all that they allow themselves to be exposed now to the same treatment in the future when they are having a non approved government opinion.\n\nGoing after peoples money is evil. \n\nWhen the government is able to tell me what I can or cannot do with my money, I do not really have that money. They are just allowing me to have it at the moment, but only to be used for approved uses. That is not freedom.\n\nThis should be a wake up call for people that we need a decentralized form of money that we do not rely on trust from anybody but the underlying mathematics. Today you may agree with the government and want to cut off the funding for the truckers and take their possessions. However, know that in the future this can then be used against you in the same way when you have an opinion that doesn't alight with the status quo.",

Drinking my morning coffee this morning I found myself thinking figuring what it was like back in the days of the gold rush. A miner working his claim would at some point, gather up his poke(bag) of gold and head to town. Enter the shady saloon with his poke and belly up to the bar. Tell the barkeep I got gold and slam his little poke down on the bar. I want a whiskey. The barkeep would measure his gold and keep a tab running. The exchange between two peoples. \n\nAs I pondered this I wondered how is this taking place in Canada now. The exchange between two peoples. How is it being controlled or not controlled? Do the people of Canada have the same freedom as that old gold miner with his poke? What do you have in your poke and how do you freely exchange it? What we are watching right now could have far-reaching impacts on the future of our nations and peoples that determine their freedom of exchange of goods and services. Will Bitcoin be placed in the scale with the eyes of only two people in the future?",
