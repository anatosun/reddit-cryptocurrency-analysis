Blockchains are not circular.\n\nThe ID of a block in a linked list is an arbitrary number. The ID of a block in a blockchain is the HASH of the contents of the block. A block in a linked list can be modified and the ID can remain the same, so the linked list does not break. In a blockchain, any change causes the ID of the changed block to change and that block is no longer referenced by its children. Changing a child block to point back to the new parent will cause that child to lose its children and so on, so you can see how a blockchain is cumbersome to change.\n\nBitcoin adds proof of work to the blockchain to ensure that any block requires a proof. You can think of the proof as a signature, but instead of it being a signature signed by the owner of a Bitcoin, it is a signature that can only be created by offering compute power to participate in a probabilistic game. It takes on average 10 minutes to produce this proof per block and this does two interesting things:\n\n1. It makes it timely and expensive to change the contents of a block as you need to do the proof of work for the block you change, AND all of its children.\n\n2. Even if you have two blockchains that are growing at the same pace, the one that is ahead will remain ahead as they are moving at the same speed.\n\nIt is in fact worse: If you think of mining as a dice game, and each game taking on average 10 minutes to complete, that 10 minutes is based on playing with a certain number of dice, eg. 100 dice. When you stop working with the rest of the network, you start mining with only your own dice and therefore you are playing with a fraction of the total dice and your blockchain will grow SLOWER than the current blockchain.\n\nAll of these parts come together to make a pretty robust and practically immutable record of transactions.",
