            "selftext": "I had fun last time I posted a bitcoin maxi ama. The people here actually gave good points, were understanding and just a good experience overall.\n\nSo I want to discuss the title with you guys today. Other communities are very closed minded or just end up making snide remarks.\n\nIll set up the discussion as I understand it, feel free to give me your points.\n\nLets pick a few non sovereign store of values that have held their value for long periods of time (so not counting bubbles like beanie babies, tulips and nfts).\n\nGold, silver, diamonds, pearls, corals, rolexes, vintage cars, memorabilia, pokemon cards.\n\nNow out of these only gold and silver became money and the rest just became store of values and some even stopped being that.\n\nIll give examples\n\n- Silver, during industrial revolution had shot up in demand. A lot of applications needed silver. Much more than gold. This caused industries to invest heavily in silver mining and considerably reduced the scarcity of silver. Since then silver has been devaluing against gold.\n\n- Diamonds and pearls lost their scarcity when humans figured out how to manufacture/ culture them. The diamond industry formed a cartel to maintain scarcity of real and artificial diamonds. This let diamonds to stay expensive and the cartel to profit. Pearls have been falling in demand and price this whole time.\n\n- rolexes, vintage cards, art and pokemon cards are the most \"security like\". They need to be verified by a third party and are neither accessible nor do they have a liquid market. But still they go up in price just for their scarcity.\n\nGold has continued to be the sov of choice due to its global supply, fungibility, liquidity, etc.\n\nNow as I see it there are two types of buyers in these markets:\n\n- Industrial buyers: These people buy gold to use it in their products. The gold in these products rarely ever comes back on the market. This includes electronics, lab equipment, chemical industries, decorative things like gold foil.\n\n- Exchanges: These are the people who buy gold only to sell to other people. They can make the gold into jewelry, coins, bars only to sell them at different premiums. They also buy peoples jewelry, coins and bars at different discounts from people. These are the coinbases of the gold world.\n\nNow out of all the gold that exists in the world,\n\n- 10 percent gold is in all our devices. Inside these devices the gold is worth more than regular gold. Example: even if an iphone has gold in it, you are better off selling the iphone than extracting the gold to sell.\n\n- 90 percent. This is what I call the hoarders. They buy gold in various forms and then hoarde it for life. They hold this to either display their wealth or to protect themselves from a doomsday scenario. We also have central banks in this group as they only use it for settlements and nothing productive. The regular population are purely hoarders and never sell this gold for more than what its worth in gold.\n\nThe industrial buyers are essentially short gold, as if they are able to source gold cheap, it would increase their profit margins. Example: an iphones price doesnt change because gold got cheaper, so just the profit margins improve.\n\nThe other buyers and hoarders are essentially long gold. Jewelers charge a percentage of gold value as \"making charges\" and the hoarders gain when gold price goes up.\n\nSo now my question is which faction of buyers make gold a good sov. Id argue its the holders and not the industries. Sure industries would give gold a price floor. But the holders make the number go up.\n\nSo now my conclusion is for a sov to be a sov and its number to go up, you just need a constant group of hoarders that keep addiing more and more gold to their stash. \n\nIn other words sovs dont need utility to stay sovs.\n\nBig post I know. Let me know your thoughts.",

YouTube is similar full of shilling. Other corners of the net are similarly biased.\n\nI once believed all the anti-BCH rhetoric but uncovered the harsh truths of what happened in the developer wars once I stumbled here and experienced how thoughtful people here are.\n\nI myself am not a BCH hype man or a BTC Maxi... I'm not interested in labels at all. I poke fun at the Bcashers gently but lurk these parts for the best discussion about crypto theory period. \n\nAs for your SOV question... the surprising answer is the paper gold investors access is the real market manipulator. If there were ever a run on gold or exit liquidity of the paper gold, the actual price would increase.",

Gold will go up again. My point is that gold goes up because the hoarders buy more and more and not because industries buy more to use it.\n\nSo in a way hoarders and not utilitarians give gold its sov \"ngu\" properties.",

The industrial use would only set a price floor. But a good sov would never come even remotely close to its price floor. Otherwise its not an sov anymore.\n\nAnd to mimic the same price floor mechanics in bitcoin, you just need people who constantly buy no matter the price.

Gold has never been at that kind of price floor and all the things that go to that price floor go even lower because the industrial guys benefit if it goes lower.\n\nWhats the driving got to do with a store of value?\n\nOk Ill make a clearer point. A use case is something you would use the thing for even if its price was zero. The people making electronics would still use gold if it was free. Thats the use case. \n\nIf bch, btc, or any crypto was at zero whats the point of moving it. Thats the difference. People who want to pay in bch arent buyers of last resort. People who wanna use gold in their products are though.\n\nThe ability to move something is only valuable if what you are moving is consistently being worth more than before. Thats why bad fiat currencies eventually die even if they can be moved for free.\n\nFinally the only thing that matters in a sov is that more and more people are willing to exchange their time to get the sov. Humanities time is unlimited (when optimistic) and thats why I said there is no last buyer. I myself buy after myself and so do many others after themselves.\n\nYou talk as if we have a fixed population with fixed net worths. No, everyone works and earns more. Your time and energy is the real currency that you pay with and that doesnt end as long as humanity propers.",

The price floor im talking about there is something like 200 dollars for 1 oz of gold. \n\nBut there is a floor. The presence of a floor establishes a worst-case value upon which confidence can be built. In the absence of a floor, the bottom is zero.\n\nI don't know where the $200 floor came from but let's say you're right. Current gold prices can drop from their current $2000 to $200 and that would represent a 90% drop. \n\nBut investors know about the floor. As the price drops, somewhere around $300 or $400 investors realize that worst case it drops 50% but there's tons of upside. The price gets supported well above $200.\n\nNow remove the floor. At $300 there's still the potential to lose everything. Where's the bottom? Price drops to $200. If the floor existed that would represent a nearly 100% chance of gains. But there's no floor. Price can still go down another 90%. Where is the floor and who catches the knife?\n\nSo the price drops to $20. People who bought the dip at $200 are now down 90%. Is this the floor? No. Price can STILL go down 90%.\n\nEtc....\n\nThe presence of a price floor doesn't imply the price will smash all the way to the floor. It implies strong resistance the closer you get to it. Without that sense of price floor, there is no bottom. It's purely a psychological experiment at that point.\n\n(I'll add that gold is a substance that's been valued almost as long as there has been civilization, it's literally woven into humanity's most ancient stories and myths. Crypto has existed for comparative seconds. Gold will also survive until after the collapse of civilization, crypto, not so much. We have to use a big grain of salt when we compare the two.)",

(Usually when scarcity is lost). This happened with pearls, corals, alot of gemstones, silver. \n\nI determined the price floor of 200 based on the consumption of gold. 10 percent of all gold produced is used for industrial purposes. So if the 90 percent cohort stop thinking of gold as an sov, only then will this price floor be met. This can only happen if we somehow lose the scarcity of gold. Maybe we figure out how to get an unlimited amount of gold from other metals through a cheap process. Something like this.\n\nUsually if a price floor is met, where the only buyers are industries, trust cant be built again. The industries control it then and they want it to be cheaper and cheaper.\n\nYes what you explained is exactly what happens in a store of value. The price always gets supported above the industrial floor. And this price is set by investors and not industries. As long as you have investors, price never reaches the floor. Thats my whole point, even if the bottom is 0, as long as there are investors who think its a store of value, the price gets supported above 0.\n\nIn any asset there is always potential to lose everything. Always. Industries dont buy because they want to make you rich. They would short the market and try to get it as cheap as possible. Look at any commodity other than monetary metals. They only go down with time, because industries want it for cheaper and cheaper.\n\nStores of value always stay in a bubble as long as the scarcity is not disturbed. If scarcity is disturbed, people move over to the next store of value.\n\nWhat im calling the industrial floor is 200 today and it can be 20 next year and 2 next. A commodity good thats not a store of value has no price floor. It only gets cheaper over time. \n\nThe stronger resistance lives and dies by the confidence of the holders thinking its a sov. Silver is a classic example of this. Industrial demand has been going up for years, but price has been going down the whole time. Silver is an altcoin to gold. People only buy it expecting a pump. But the longer you hold it the more you are better off holding gold instead.",

In my grandmother's time people used to wear necklaces with corals in them. They used to be expensive back then.\n\nThen people started making fake corals and there was no way to distinguish between the fake and the real ones. This made the price of corals go down significantly. And now in my generation no one even knows that corals used to be used in jewelry.\n\nThe exact same thing happened with pearls when we figured out cultured pearls. And now my generation buys real gold and wears fake pearls.\n\nThis has always been a pattern. If these things had never lost their scarcity they would still be expensive and still be used as jewelry. \n\nBragging is done with all things expensive, but with sovs people hoarde them even when they dont want to brag about them.",

In that process you store the gold bar but you don't store the value, the value still out there changing by the price mechasim. \n\nYou can promote gold by presenting people how wonderful(or useful) gold is, and if enough people think that you have a point, they may want to purchase your gold at a higher price, in that process you created a demand for gold, and it is still to be transfered into monetary value by assigning a higher price and confirming that price by making the sale. And there is no \"store of value\" involved anywhere in that process.   \n\nIf we really want to discuss this issue we better be precise about the term. The term store of value is a made up concept by some marketing team to somewhat justify the argument \"something can be so valuable in monetary term but without the same level of value in absolute term\" It can happen in short term but there is hardly any example that stand up in time.",

No single asset or currency has stayed *constant* for longer periods of time. Everything fluctuates. Including upwards, mind you, but fluctuates nonetheless. Implication: the \"store of value\" debate is a 1st world problem.\n2. Bitcoin was never meant to be a \"store of value\". If it was, the whitepaper's title would have been \"Bitcoin: an electronic peer to peer store of value\", which is not. The defining characteristic of Bitcoin is being able to *transact*. There is no mechanism in Bitcoin for it to \"store value\" for long amounts of time - nor there can be.\n\n> So now my conclusion is for a sov to be a sov and its number to go up, you just need a constant group of hoarders that keep addiing more and more X to their stash. \n\nSorry to be blunt, but sounds like a ponzi.",

They settle on these things based on how much effort/ time is needed to create more of that thing when demand is greater than supply over time. Thats scarcity. Call it store of value or dont. Call it store of time and energy spent. Sovs only need to be sovs over a long term. Because storing is a long term activity.\n\n2. Gold was never meant to be  \"store of value\". People found it and made it into one due to its scarcity. The defining characteristic of bitcoin is being able to achieve consensus in a distributed way. Solving byzantines general problem. And through that we figured out a way to enforce perfect scarcity in a globally distributed way. Right now even if adam back said lets keep the max limit as 22 million, hed be bashed and thrown out. Thats what we achieved with bitcoin even if it was not meant to be that way. We always had ways to transact. We never had ways to enforce scarcity.\n\nNo it doesnt sound like a ponzi, it sounds like a bubble. Money always sounds like its in a bubble. Ponzis promise returns and pay early investors with new investors money. In bitcoin no one promises returns. There is no expectation of profit from someone when I buy bitcoin. If it makes a profit, it makes a profit and if it doesnt, it doesnt.",

                    "response": "> So now my question is which faction of buyers make gold a good sov. Id argue its the holders and not the industries. Sure industries would give gold a price floor. But the holders make the number go up.\n\n> So now my conclusion is for a sov to be a sov and its number to go up, you just need a constant group of hoarders that keep addiing more and more gold to their stash.\n \nI think you have a lot of moving parts conflated here. Such as what makes a good SoV with some sort of a price floor (an intrinsic or alternate use case). This is mixed with how many coins are static (horded) versus liquidity used in exchange.\n\nI see an issue in your conclusion...\n\n>  ...for a sov to be a sov and its number to go up, you just need a constant group of hoarders...\n\nAn ideal SoV, the number (value) doesn't go up and up. The SoV means that an Oz of gold should buy the same number of groceries now and 10 years from now. So it isn't a SoV that causes numbers to go up, it's really the other inflating fiat that's going down.\n\nBut you you continue with scarcity...\n\n> ... a constant group of hoarders that keep addiing more and more gold to their stash.\n\nThis is the other dimension of an ideal SoV, a fixed supply. And yes, more participants clamoring for fewer coins will cause an increase in value. But the value of the coins isn't a measure of how many are held, it's a measure of the liquid, the traded portion.\n\nAs the liquid portion shrinks, approaching zero, the prices rise exponentially. But are people willing to continue trading other real world assets for an exponentially high price. At some point the marketplace weighs the conditions and rejects the trade and an equilibrium forms. A balance forms, but it will never be stable enough to declare a SoV.\n\nLet's say there is a fixed supply and it is split between two factions; hoarders and traders. But the only distinction between a hoarder and trader is a fickle mental state. One wants to hold their stake and one is ready to sell. Effectively both are sellers, only the hoarder's price is somewhere higher than a trader's. *And because either can quickly and easily change their disposition, there is no such thing as a SoV*. \n\nNot even gold is immune. Not even if gold has other intrinsic uses that cushion its perceived asset value in the marketplace, it could become near worthless. [Case in point, what happens to gold SoV when they start mining asteroid 16 Psyche?](https://theprint.in/opinion/giant-asteroid-has-gold-worth-700-quintillion-but-it-wont-make-us-richer/260482/) There is no floor.\n\nThe question is then how much would a mining craft have to bring back to earth to cover the cost of the mission and make a profit whilst not simultaneously collapsing the market value of gold?",

However giving gold utility as cash could even backfire, if gov'ts decided to sell off their hoards (it only *has* value to them if it's centralized!). It makes me wonder why gold bugs never seem to support GoldCash (decentralized gold standard). They all prefer a centralized standard instead. I guess one issue is the gold-cash forces users to tip to the nearest mg (6c, or even 10mg) of gold.\n\nBitcoin, like gold, can become a centralized **S**tore **O**f **V**alue, if the block-size is too small. However both versions can co-exist, imo. Without a high enough txn volume on BCH, there's not necessarily a proof a BTC block-size increase is necessary.",

So, we shall agree here \"value\" means something objective not subjective preference.  As the axiom of purchasing power of ideal money that one shall boil water at the same amount of money even hundred years later, we shall agree \"value\" here is isomorphic to energy.  So, the store of value is to store energy.  Sometime the ideal money could be eatable and inherently a store of value. But when money is not eatable, it is like the token of energy quota or energy accounting.  To match the economy size, its volume shall increase or decrease if its unit purchasing power is constant, or its unit price in term of energy shall appreciate or depreciate if its volume is constant.\n\n\"utility\" could be, in your words, industry utility and I agree that money does not need to have any industry utility as I don't think ancient people knew about electricity and I know a king had a golden armor which is obviously heavy for fighting so its existence must be symbolic and signaled something (as your grandma story).  But \"utility\" could also mean some usage that is important to people. In topic about money, the obvious \"utility\" is to exchange the goods/service with other people.  Then you could recall the story of USA 1933 and the following decade that people initially hold/hide their gold but then gave in to the government at a bad price because gold is not divisible and accordingly could only handle high value transaction while people were eager to exchange bread or anything cheap-but-important for living.\n\nWhen a store-of-value cannot handle many cheap-but-important stuff, it dies or becomes an investment which is not possible to exchange to lower-value money then to exchange the desired goods/service in hostile context.\n\nI think we all agree the fiats are hostile to bitcoin.",

And with how technology and society advances, a future person's time and energy should give you more goods and services than todays person's time and energy.\n\nYes this is is very qualitative. But feels grounded in logic.\n\nA point about gold. People did not give their gold in return for fiat currencies. People gave their gold in return for gold backed currency. The govt also made it illegal to hold monetary gold.\n\nIf people knew that 50 years later, they would lose the redeemability of the dollar for gold, they wouldve never given their gold.

What you say is actually the so-called energy gain factor in the energy industry where more energy is collected with the same energy input thanks to tech advance.  However one could always think \"dollar\" as another energy unit that \"one dollar\" means \"1 Twh\" without bothering the tech advance.\n\n> If people knew that 50 years later, they would lose the redeemability of the dollar for gold, they wouldve never given their gold.\n\nI guess not because they were hungry \"today\".  Don't you see \"Someone in my future generations will use it in a life or death situation\" means he/she gives up the coin at a bad price to a bad-but-usable fiat money because hunger is \"a life or death situation\"?\n\n> Point of bitcoin is that it happened once, people wont let it happen again.\n\nAre you saying you don't think governments are hostile?  or are you saying you have a deal with the governments that \"you let me be the new wealthy elite to replace the old Buffett and I agree bitcoin cannot be the money to compete against your fiat money\"?\n\nAnyway, I guess \"people wont let it happen again\" is false and I think core chain will go the same route again because core chain intentionally allows only high value transaction.  Also, the block size limit is a non-issue because block size shall be the economic result not an artificial limit.

Whereas utility is a momentary measurement, or an implied measurement, like kinetic energy. Here too, both are about value and each has a measurement, but they are distinctly different forms.\n\nThis interplay between storage and utility, because both involve a state of value, often confuse discussions on value.",
