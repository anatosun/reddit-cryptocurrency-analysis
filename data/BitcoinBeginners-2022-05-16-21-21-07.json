I\u2019m a complete noob which probably doesn\u2019t help in this search. \nBonus: I appreciate this is a Bitcoin sub, however is the process the same for other cryptos? \nBonus 2: any general advice on storing cryptos would be great \n\nAny helpful responses will be hugely appreciated! Many thanks.",
