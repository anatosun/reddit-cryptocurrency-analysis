You can put a value on said work, but the work is first and priority.\n* Investments: Meant to be digital gold.\n* Currencies: Meant to be  digital a fiat/money for every day spending.  Meaning more stable in price.\n* Memes: For the lols.  Might shoot up, might crater, we\u2019re all in it for the fun.\n\n\nDoge started as a meme, was setup to be a currency, but because of that big moonshot people are trying to convert it into an investment style.\n\nIt might work out for you if Doge becomes an Investment type or even stays a currency type, but you will be burned badly if it reverts to pure meme.",
