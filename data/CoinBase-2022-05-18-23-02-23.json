I had 16k worth of Cardano sitting in my exodus account I transferred the coins to Coinbase and sold them to usd before adding my bank info ( Chase) Coinbase is telling me they are having technical issues and will get back to me for over a week now. I need to get that cash into my checking account. Any tips or pointers would be appreciated.\n\nAt the time of writing this the bank account has yet to be linked. I just see the amount sitting in my Coinbase account.\n\nThank you in advance.",
