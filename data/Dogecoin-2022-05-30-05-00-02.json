Elon reached out to me to get hold of that script and it became apparent very quickly that he didn\u2019t understand coding as well as he made out. He asked, \u201cHow do I run this Python script?\u201d\"    \n\nThis is the \"genius\" and \"visionary\" you all look up to. Mr pretender who doesn't know how to run a script.    \n\nThe man who ignored the potential of dogecoin/crypto for 6 years before even getting involved and learn about it. Now you think he has the answers?   \n\nSure he maybe a great rocket engineer and great marketing, that does not mean he knows anything about cryptos.   \n\nStop idolizing him for the wrong reasons.",
