Tether, Coinbase's UST and anything along those lines are subject to total loss and return to zero value like WLUNA at any point in the future.\n\nStablecoins have nothing to do with Satoshi/CIA's masterpiece in Bitcoin blockchain.  Stablecoins boil down to \"arbitrage feedback loop to another instrument\".  So your stablecoin is only as stable as the other instrument which is also itself a ponzie.  So the Stable in stablecoin is a function of the value of another cryptocurrency.  It's stable as long as the ponzie keeps growing with the number of people who keep money in stablecoin.  Which can't be.  stablecoins are ponzies.",

There was no warning of this at the time. There is now a warning for this bc so many users did this exact thing. \n\nCoinbase controls the private key to the wallet that these funds sit in and could easily send the funds right back to the wallet from which they came. They choose not to bc of a remarkably shitty policy that every other exchange would typically help their users with. It would take them about 5 minutes to send my 240k coins back to me. \n\nI've never once gotten past their entry level support team. I've never gotten anything other than a shitty, canned answer. \n\nTerrible policies. Useless customer service. Awful experience.

I've never gotten anything other than a shitty, canned answer.  \n>  \n>Terrible policies. Useless customer service. Awful experience.

I'm suing Coinbase, and guess what, they bribed the district court and the appellate court to grant their motion to compel arbitration, despite the fact that my claim \"grand theft\" out of arbitration agreement. They know that I have all the evidence (50 pages) against the theft in Coinbase and are trying to stop my every move.\n\nYou should know that Coinbase is stealing user funds, not a hacker. I did a deep investigation and submitted to the court. But what did the court do? She stated in the Order, that my claim is allegedly only about violation of the contract and that's it. Not a word about theft. The appeal also granted Coinbase's motion and illegally dismissed my case. Now I'm taking serious action.\n\nIt is very easy to guess who has private keys in Coinbase. Not your keys, not your coins, it's true. Coinbase is a scam company that constantly steals user funds. If Coinbase didn't steal your money, you're lucky, but you are in line. They steal from thousands of users, but they have millions of users.",

They know that I have all the evidence (50 pages) against the theft in Coinbase and are trying to stop my every move.\r  \nYou should know that Coinbase is stealing user funds, not a hacker. I did a deep investigation and submitted to the court. But what did the court do? She stated in the Order, that my claim is allegedly only about violation of the contract and that's it. Not a word about theft. The appeal also granted Coinbase's motion and illegally dismissed my case. Now I'm taking serious action.\r  \nIt is very easy to guess who has private keys in Coinbase. Not your keys, not your coins, it's true. Coinbase is a scam company that constantly steals user funds. If Coinbase didn't steal your money, you're lucky, but you are in line. They steal from thousands of users, but they have millions of users.",
