Tether, Coinbase's UST and anything along those lines are subject to total loss and return to zero value like WLUNA at any point in the future.\n\nStablecoins have nothing to do with Satoshi/CIA's masterpiece in Bitcoin blockchain.  Stablecoins boil down to \"arbitrage feedback loop to another instrument\".  So your stablecoin is only as stable as the other instrument which is also itself a ponzie.  So the Stable in stablecoin is a function of the value of another cryptocurrency.  It's stable as long as the ponzie keeps growing with the number of people who keep money in stablecoin.  Which can't be.  stablecoins are ponzies.",

That said, it has been irritating that when they initiated the ETH staking program they said there would be a liquidity workaround enabled by the end of 2021 but apparently they quietly decided to nix that plan with no public announcement.

They know that I have all the evidence (50 pages) against the theft in Coinbase and are trying to stop my every move.\r  \nYou should know that Coinbase is stealing user funds, not a hacker. I did a deep investigation and submitted to the court. But what did the court do? She stated in the Order, that my claim is allegedly only about violation of the contract and that's it. Not a word about theft. The appeal also granted Coinbase's motion and illegally dismissed my case. Now I'm taking serious action.\r  \nIt is very easy to guess who has private keys in Coinbase. Not your keys, not your coins, it's true. Coinbase is a scam company that constantly steals user funds. If Coinbase didn't steal your money, you're lucky, but you are in line. They steal from thousands of users, but they have millions of users.",
