You can also get margin called on short notice and need to immediately settle the loan \n\n2) They are are ponzi scheme , create a sketchy ICO from nothing , steal your BTC and replace it for this ICO token to \"stake\" and earn interest where they can pay older investors with new victims . They need a constant supply of new investors or \"stakers\" in their scamcoin to keep the whole scheme going or everything falls apart\n\n3) They are a straight up scam and will just steal your money\n\nAt minimum there is privacy and tax complications from staking/lending your bitcoin\n\nThan there are issues where data breaches lead to risks of you being targeted by hackers who will phish you or worse those that want kidnap you and torture you for your coins\n\nhttps://blockfi-s3-static-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/Incident+Post+Mortem%2C+May+14%2C+2020.pdf\n\nThan the custodian can get hacked(sometimes the employees or owners are the ones who perform the theft) like celsius who lost 50 million and you have a Mtgox scenario\n\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-lending-firm-celsius-reportedly-affected-in-badgerdao-exploit\n \nAnother issues is many of these services are likely fractional thus you are diluting the supply of your assets by using them and thus decreasing the ability for your investment to appreciate in value\n\n\n\nIf you need fiat than why not just sell some of your bitcoin?",

            "selftext": "I got my first hardware wallet a few days ago, a Ledger Nano S. Kinda excited to try it, but I have a couple of questions.\n\n1. Is it safe to use the hardware wallet connected to a relatively unsecured computer? (Nothing crazy, it's got antivirus on it and all the updates, but it's Windows and used online daily.) Or would it be better to use the HW wallet with an Android phone maybe?\n\n2. Am I good if I use my hardware wallet as Ledger's tutorials instruct, connecting it to the computer via a USB? The reason I'm asking is I saw this thread earlier: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/u7wrwk/this\\_is\\_honestly\\_the\\_most\\_practical\\_way\\_to\\_use\\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/u7wrwk/this_is_honestly_the_most_practical_way_to_use_a/) and there's a lot of talk about only ever using the hardware wallet in airgapped mode. I am not sure if Nano S can even be used in an airgapped mode; plus, it came without a sticker because apparently the Ledger Live app is meant to scan the device to confirm it's not been tampered with. What's the safest way to proceed from here? What level of security can I expect if I'm using Ledger Live with a not particularly secure computer?\n\nMany thanks in advance for any insight. And a thank you to all who help in this subreddit, you guys are amazing.",

Now that I've taken a bit of an interest in crypto I decided to withdraw it today.\n\nI just submitted a request to withdraw some money from an online casino into my wallet. I use Wasabi Wallet and when I create a receive address it requires me to create a label. When I withdrew it from the casino site it did not ask me to put in the label. Are labels required for transactions? Because I still put it under the \"comments\" tab and stated, \"the label is: money from wildcasinos\".\n\nsorry I'm sorta paranoid about this sorta stuff",

Even if one is convinced, the evidence only supports the claim that the **dominant miner may have generated significantly less than a million bitcoin in our view. Perhaps 600,000 to 700,000 bitcoin** is a better estimate.\n\n>**None of the above says much about whether the dominant miner was Satoshi**, although we know Satoshi mined block 9, which we have allocated to the dominant miner in our analysis. **However this is in a slope of just 11 blocks, so it\u2019s certainly not conclusive**. Whoever the dominant miner was, it is of course **possible the keys have been lost or discarded by now**.\n\nThus block 9 and genesis block was created by Satoshi 100%, and the evidence reflects he might have mined 11 blocks at least in addition to the genesis under these assumptions .\n\nThis means the evidence suggests we definitely know satoshi mined 2 blocks , and likely mined 11 blocks, and that **perhaps** there was a dominant miner who mined between 600-700k bitcoin(not blocks). **There are other explanations for the extranonce pattern that do not point to a dominant miner. Simply a similar software setup can cause this.**\n\nSince there was over 5 days between the genesis block being mined and block 1 and difficulty was 1 it would be safer to assume satoshi waited for other miners to start mining before joining in .\n\nHere are examples of at least 2 early miners mining alongside satoshi from the start \n\nhttps://stephanlivera.com/episode/314/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/halfin/status/1110302988\n\n--------------------\n\n>What is Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin address?\n\nPeople tip satoshi to the genesis block address. Even though he cannot spend(there is serious doubts he is still alive) the 50 BTC from the genesis block he can still spend any tips sent to it. \n\nhttps://live.blockcypher.com/btc/address/12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX/\n\nYou can see he received 1.34834495 btc over the years to this address and none of the tips spent",
