But trying to use T/A will get you wrecked 90% of the time. Buying at generally lower levels and selling at new highs is generally what has been successful for me. Everyone has their own strategy but trying to use T/A to trade is a losing game. Especially for beginners.",

He had no funds so I transferred from a private wallet to his Bisq wallet. It appeared in the video that no fee was charged. How is this possible? (it may be that I misunderstood the vid)...",

He showed that he could generate and display a compromised seed phrase on a user's Nano Ledger S by downloading modified MCU firmware onto the Ledger. This showed that a malicious 3rd party could do this to a customer's Ledger if it was tampered with before the customer received it for the first time.\n\n(source here: [https://saleemrashid.com/2018/03/20/breaking-ledger-security-model/](https://saleemrashid.com/2018/03/20/breaking-ledger-security-model/))\n\nGiven this information and the steps I have taken to upgrade my Ledger's firmware to the most recent version, would you consider this Ledger Nano S safe for use?

If the private key is a single line in an encrypted text file, you could say that encrypted text file is a wallet  \n\nFor receiving, the user can make an address from a private key and send the address to the sender  \n\nThe node software has all or most of the above functions, and has an option to disable the creation of a wallet. Unfortunately, some useful functions are disabled on a no-wallet node  \n\nThe other wrinkle is that a node tracks its wallet's transaction history by matching the addresses in its wallet  \n\nWithout a wallet, the node owner needs some other way to track and record transaction history. Make sure the node has *txindex=1* and record a list of txIDs. Then, maybe your list of txIDs is your wallet  \n\nIt would be easier to set up a watching-only wallet in the node. All the transaction tracking functions are built-in to the node. Why would you want to develop your own software, or time-wasting manual methods?",

However, doing this can cause privacy concerns, as whatever server you are connecting to will be able to correlate your addresses.\n\nYou can alleviate privacy concerns by running your own node, but that's outside the scope of the original question.",

I got caught up with trezor and purchased one, I realize its too much for my simple plan and needs, so after about 5 transactions, the trezor has been sitting in my desk drawer.\n\nI found that the perfect, lowcost setup, is my OP2 phone, running lineage, installed 3 apps from fdroid: SBW, orbot, and netguard.\n\nI setup netguard to firewall the whole phone and just punch 2 holes into the firewall, one for SBW and one for orbot.",

You do not own any Bitcoin but \"IOUs\". (legally you own the bitcoin but practically you don't as the law will not help you in most cases and can and often will be used against you) You have little privacy and your bitcoin is in control of someone else that has their own private keys/seeds which you do not have that reserve your Bitcoin. The bitcoin you own might not exist or may be fractional as well diluting the supply of Bitcoin and decreasing the ability of your investment to appreciate in value. Keeping bitcoin in exchanges also makes Bitcoin more insecure as a whole from attacks and theft. \n\n**Non - Custodial wallets**\n\nYou have the Bitcoin in your private wallet and no one knows your privatekey/seed backup but you. You actually own your own Bitcoin. \n\n------------------------------------------\n\n**Hot wallets vs Warm Wallets vs Cold wallets**\n\n**Hot wallet** - wallet connected to the internet. \n\nExamples - mobile wallets , web wallets , wallets in exchanges, desktop wallets  \n\n**Warm wallet** - wallet indirectly connected to the internet but a piece of hardware tries to isolate the private keys and transaction signing \n\nExamples - hardware wallets. wallets like cold card with PSBTs offer slightly better security than other HW wallets when used correctly  \n\n**cold wallet** - wallet not connected to the internet \n\nExamples - paper wallets(all new paper wallets should use 12-24 seed words instead of private keys), offline laptop that never connects to the internet with a wallet, , hardware wallets not connected to the internet\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Closed source vs Open source**\n\n**Closed source wallets** - Code for your wallet is not publicly available and auditable by third parties. This allows backdoors and exploits that internal employees or external attackers can exploit and really undermines the security and ideals of decentralization as you must have faith in the company or wallet developers.\n\nWhy use cryptocurrency at all if you have to have faith in a single company or developer?\n\n**Open source wallets** - wallets that allow the source code to be independently audited and peer reviewed and freedom to continue developing the wallet even if the original developers disappear. While not immune from software bugs and exploits (as all code is vulnerable to) open source code gives better transparency and security. You might not be able to understand and audit the code but many other can and will and be able to warn you if a backdoor or exploit exists.\n\nhttps://walletscrutiny.com/\n\n-------------\n\n>Now I want to move that BTC into a wallet on my phone say. \n\nWallets allow you to create a QR code and an address that you copy over into the the exchange to withdraw your bitcoin to . \n\nI suggest you watch the videos showing how to use common wallets in the FAQ \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/g42ijd/faq_for_beginners/\n\n\n>How is it moved into a cold wallet?\n\nIf a wallet is offline and doesn't connect to the internet it is cold. This wallet can be software or a piece of paper . When you request the bitcoin to be sent to an offline wallet the bitcoin gets associated to the private keys associated to your offline wallet on the public blockchain . You can look up the transaction and the balance in a third party block explorer or full node not associated with your offline wallet or simply see the transaction and balance when your cold wallet becomes hot again",

The Bitcoin that a hot wallet holds lives in addresses controlled by the hot wallet's private keys. The Bitcoin that a cold wallet holds lives in addresses controlled by the cold wallet's private keys. \n\nTo transfer Bitcoin from one address on the blockchain to another address on the blockchain (which is the ONLY way to transfer Bitcoin), a piece of software creates a transaction that describes the transfer, digitally signs that transaction using the appropriate private key(s), and submits it to the network. If it's valid, it will be included in the mempool, where it and other pending transactions wait for a miner to add it to a block that the miner appends to the blockchain. Once it has been added to the blockchain, the transaction is complete and the transfer is realized.\n\nTldr: Wallets don't store Bitcoin. Wallets store private keys to addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain; the blockchain is a ledger of transactions that irrefutably prove the transfer of Bitcoin from one address to another.",

The cold wallet stores the *private keys* offline (encrypted on the device, and stored in the seed phrase backup written down).\n\nThe exchange's (or your phone wallet's) private keys are used to *sign* a Bitcoin transaction transferring ownership from their address's ownership to the address generated from your cold wallet's private keys. The record of that signed transaction is recorded on the blockchain. \n\nIf you want to send back from your cold wallet to an exchange, your hardware device *signs* the transaction transferring ownership to the exchange's address. The device must be connected to a networked device like a computer to send that signed transaction to Bitcoin nodes, but the private keys never leave the hardware device. \n\nI like to think of Bitcoin transactions as a \"push\" mechanism. When you go to a store and pay with a credit card, the merchant uses your CC number to \"pull\" funds from your CC account. When you pay someone with Bitcoin, you \"push\" coins from the ownership of your address to *their address*.\n\nI think I answered your question, does this help your understanding some?",

For ASICs specifically, see [HS code 8471&nbsp;4100&nbsp;00](https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/commodities/8471410000?country=#import).\n\n[There are some circumstances in which customs duty burden can be reduced](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-can-pay-a-reduced-rate-of-customs-duty), but no such provisions exist for import VAT, so there is no legal way to reduce your tax burden here.\n\nIt is the *buyer's (i.e. your)* responsibility to ensure that the seller accurately declares the nature and value of the goods they are despatching  to you. This is done by the seller affixing a [CN23 customs form (PDF)](https://www.royalmail.com/sites/default/files/CN23.pdf) to the package. The UK customs office will inspect packages to confirm the declaration is accurate/suitable. For you to request that the seller intentionally mis-declare the nature and value of the goods constitutes fraud.\n\nYou need to either:\n\n(a) pay the import VAT to the seller at the time of purchase, in which case it should be itemised on your invoice, and it is then the seller's responsibility to forward this VAT to HMRC (typically done via VAT MOSS); or\n\n(b) if the seller does not collect import VAT on sales to UK buyers, the UK customs office will apply the import VAT when the goods enter the UK, and you will have to pay it to the courier before you can receive the goods, [else they will be withheld and ultimately disposed of](https://www.gov.uk/customs-seizures).\n\nDon't try to evade taxes, you will just get burned by hefty fines and/or prosecution: at least \u00a320,000 and/or up to 7 years imprisonment under [VAT Act 1994 \u00a772(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/23/section/72).",

In addition, since I\u2019m a foreigner in this country, in future it\u2019s likely I\u2019ll have to return to my own country. Therefore, I would need to be able to access that Bitcoin. My current PayPal is bound to the phone number that I have in this current country, so it would probably be of no use when I return to my country. This means whatever service I buy the Bitcoin from should allow to me to access it without needing a phone number, since I would lose this phone number when I leave this country. \n\nI need recommendations of where to by Bitcoin from, and specifically, these are my questions: \n\nwhat do I need? \n\nWhat is a crypto \u201cwallet\u201d? \n\nHow do I get a crypto wallet? \n\nWhere do I keep a crypto wallet?\n\nHow do I secure and access a crypto wallet?\n\nI would need the Bitcoin storage thingy to be accessible from ANYWHERE around the world: is this possible? Would it be always possible to convert the Bitcoin back to normal money \u2013 like USD? If so, how is this accomplished? \n\nThank you!",

One way to do this is by using a passphrase which acts as a 25th word for your seedphrase. Each new passphrase creates an entirely new wallet with a completely different set of addresses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother benefit is that by having multiple wallets, if someone were to try and threaten you to give your bitcoin you can open one of your wallets and give that to them and keep the remainder, its typically called a duress wallet.",

If you plan to give ownership to someone else in the future, like to your child, then keeping fixed amounts in different wallets is useful.\n\nIdeally, you keep one wallet and focus on securing it properly: keep it away from the internet, make it difficult to accidentally expose to the internet and keep it hidden and secret.\n\nOne cold wallet can provide many addresses. If you use a hardware wallet, you can generate an XPUB file which will allow you to generate receive addresses on the fly using a wallet like bluewallet or sparrow without ever exposing your private key. These wallets will not be able to spend... It's like magic. \ud83d\ude01\n\nYou can then erase the hardware wallet since you don't need it to hold the keys for you...

By now, most wallets will use bc1 addresses by default, but there are still many older addresses around that use legacy address formats.",

You need to consider getting a cheap decoy safe and fill it with costume jewelry and fake luxury watches(do not use fake gold it is too obvious) for 5 dollar wrench attacks . You can throw your bip39 seed words in the decoy safe too as it will just have your decoy wallet with a small balance for them to steal\n\n>Buy land > Dig Hole > Cement in Safe > Cover\n\nanything underground , even in a sealed container should be a metal backup",

You can easily hide this if you want with splitting up the balance between addresses and using coincontrol or just using multiple exchanges . \n\nThe people committing armed home invasion and torturing you for assets typically aren't \"hackers\" either. I have seen many of these events and know exactly how it occurs. If you give them enough decoys to satiate their needs in the decoy safe they will leave you without a lot of torture. \n\n>I agree on the Stainless steel backup for sure.\n\nCopper is fine too, or just steel, lopps tests show how well these metal backups work \n\nhttps://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/\n\njust cannot use aluminum due to its melting point",

Using only bitcoin makes you much safer \n\n6) You use a custodial wallet that gets hacked or runs off with your money \n\n**solution** -  only use popular open source wallets that are non custodial \n\nhttps://walletscrutiny.com\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aZ1zbaUEzCo9NCctN8-eL2VLIiSdY009tTJvRXDUWEw/edit#gid=0\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/g42ijd/faq_for_beginners/\n\n7) You decide to be very creative with your own custom backup and wallet security instead of doing what others recommend and lose your money due to forgetting your passphrase, or other methods like bitrot \n\n**solution** - don't re-invent the wheel , stick with recommended guidelines that have been studied over the years and proven to keep people secure even from their own mistakes \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/g42ijd/faq_for_beginners/fouo3kh/",

This means that **such a change would require unanimous support which would be an impossible task** especially since the 21 limit is considered part of Bitcoins ethos and brand.\n\nThe most that would happen if some group did this is create an altcoin that people ignored and dumped their split coins on which would drive the price of that altcoin into the ground. The Game theory would also support the scarcer and original coin being desired while the altcoin being dumped and exchanged for real Bitcoins.",

Since house prices are through the roof here in the Netherlands, this is a big problem for me.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrency might enable me to pay off this debt as soon as possible. I bet there are a lot of people on here trying to achieve the same thing through investments cryptocurrency. In about 2 years I'll have to start paying **\u20ac166,49** a month for 15 years. (0% interest)\n\nI've been wandering through this cryptocurrency world for about 1.5 year now and unfortunately I haven't made great profits (and no losses) yet. Any people here in the same situation? Maybe some people that already have gotten rid of their debts? Please tell me how you've done so. I'm still looking for a good strategy to get rid of this debt. I'm not looking for a get rich fast method. But any idea or strategy that would help me pay off this debt sooner would be very welcome.

Interest free debt isn't costing you anything, can pay the minimum payment, invest any extra money into something more stable (diversify between ETFs and maybe a little crypto in there) then any positive growth is pure profit. What little amount that this debt is costing you on a future mortgage should easily be offset by your potential earnings made from investing (30k + profits). Housing market is just a beast right now so not an ideal time to buy however I do not believe it can continue this way forever so wait for the dip in that too.",

My assumption that it's a double spend comes from a discord warning from an admin that said there are scammers targeting people with crypto and that the transaction dissapeared when before it was showing up as pending. I have also recieved an email from Coinbase confirming the funds were sent.\n\nThe transaction doesn't show up anymore under my history when before it was. The latest one I have is from yesterday.\n\nI don't know how is this possible and it's also the first time out of 50+ times this has happened to me.\n\nI didn't sent the coins to or from the wallet. I recieved it from someone else!\n\nEDIT 2: appearently coinbase has issues with BTC transactions and multiple people are having the same problem",

You no longer control that Bitcoin, so in the direct sense you no longer own or possess it, What you now possess is an IOU from Coinbase for that amount of Bitcoin. The exchange is not a wallet, meaning that Bitcoin you deposit is not guaranteed to sit on an address for you to view.\n\nIf those assumptions are not correct then please give us more info about what you were expecting to see with this address.",

Just because it wasn't you doesn't mean it was double spent (this term has a very specific meaning having to do with the \"double spend problem\").\n\nMy recommendation is to first confirm exactly where you got this address. Did you get it from your Coinbase *exchange* account? Log in and click Send/Receive, select Bitcoin, and look at the address it gives you. Also, if this is how you got the address, how recently did you copy it? Coinbase may rotate/change the address it gives you. If it has changed, maybe you can recover your funds by contacting customer support. Good luck if you have to go this route, as it may take awhile.\n\nIf this is not where you got the address (and the 0.0008 BTC is not credited to your account) then that Bitcoin is possibly gone forever. Two possible options I can think of:\n\n1. The address is from your wallet, but someone else has your private keys. Maybe someone who had access to your device or malware stole the seed or master private key and has a program somewhere that scans your addresses and sweeps funds it finds into its own wallet.\n2. The address you used is not actually yours but is someone else's. Malware or some other malicious code on your device recognized a Bitcoin address on your clipboard and swapped theirs for yours without you realizing it.\n\nThe good news is that it's only \\~$30. Many have paid a far steeper price to learn similar lessons about being careful with securing private keys and double-checking addresses when copy/pasting.",

Then the app (TrustWallet) told me to \"wipe the wallet\" because it's on a rooted device. I am sure my device is not compromised, but regardless, I've removed the wallet from the app (so now when I open the app it asks me to create a new wallet or input recovery seed).\n\nThe wallet which recovery seed I have used is empty at the moment.\n\nThe phone is a new one, but I have installed some apps on it from outside Google Play which were granted root access (naturally, that's why I rooted it)\n\nQuestion 1 - do I understand it correctly, the problem with rooted phone is that another app can read the private keys of my wallet out of the TrustWallet's app files?\n\nQuestion 2 -  is there any reason to suspect some sleeper malware has recorded the private keys, transferred them to the hacker, and now they're going to monitor those and steal my crypto if I ever transfer it to my hardware wallet?\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone. Will ditch the old wallet (seed) then (its empty anyway, and I don't need transaction history), make a new hardware seed, and not ever input it anywhere except my hardware wallet.",

But as everyone else who replied said, the whole point of a hardware wallet is that you can't know for sure.\n\n1. Make sure you have a copy of your old seed.\n2. Reset your hardware wallet to give it a new seed.\n3. Put your old seed in to Electrum or some other wallet.\n4. Use that wallet to xfer all your BTC to the hardware wallet.\n5. Keep a backup copy of your new seed in a safety deposit box and treat it like a huge wad of cash, which it is \n6. Never enter your seed into any other wallet again.

Liquidations counts as closing a trade, and so amplifies the price movement that brought the price to the liquidation point.\n\ne.g. you open a leveraged long position, and the price drops to the point you get liquidated. The liquidation counts as a Sell, and so add to the already existing selling pressure, leading the price to drop even further.\n\nNotice that:\n\n* the liquidations forces a closing trade that is the opposite to traditional investing principles. In the above example, the trader gets forced to sell-low when traditionally they should be buying low.\n* the more bullish the trader, the higher the leverage they'll be tempted to take... which will make getting liquidated much easier, amplifying price movement in the opposite direction. So the more bullish the leveraged traders, the more the market is vulnerable to a dump.\n\nThese contribute somewhat to Bitcoin's volatility.",

                    "response": "A fork is a, usually 4-pronged, eating utensil.\n\nBut I guess you're more interested in the Bitcoin-specific meaning of the word. There are actually 2 forms to distinguish:\n\nA **software fork**. Bitcoin Core (and many other Bitcoin-related software projects) is open source, which means that anyone can see the source code and make changes to it. Taking the source code, making some modifications to it and then publishing those modifications is a way to \"fork\" the software. These changes can be trivial (changing the font in the user interface) or significant (completely overhauling how the software manages its data structures).\n\nA **blockchain fork**. When talking about Bitcoin (or cryptocurrency in general), this is what is usually meant when the term fork is used. A blockchain is a collection of blocks where each block has a reference to the previous block. Thus forming a chain of a blocks:\n\n    1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 ... \n\nBut it's possible for multiple blocks to claim the title of next block in the chain, for example because they're mined at almost the same time:\n\n    1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6a - 7a\n                      \\\n                        6b - 7b\n\nHere a fork has occurred between block 5 and 6. The chain is split into two branches and miners can carry on with either branch.\n\nSince this is quite undesirable (block 6a and 6b might have transactions that are in conflict with each other, leading to an uncertain state of the ledger), the Bitcoin protocol specifies that miners will only continue on the longest chain, that is, the branch that is the furthest along (note: technically the \"longest chain\" rule is a bit more complicated, as it also involves the mining difficulty, but for a general understanding the notion of \"longest chain\" is fine).\n\nSo when such a fork happens, some miners will start to work on block 7a to follow up 6a, while others work on 7b to follow up 6b (with the choice usually determined by whether they receive 6a or 6b first). Once the 7th block is mined and broadcast, the miners on the \"losing\" branch abandon it and move to the winning branch and everyone is on the same team again.\n\nSuch forks caused by near-simultaneous blocks being mined happen from time to time, but they're always resolved very quickly. In certain specific situations, it could take longer to resolve them. For example if there are wide spread network issues that effectively separate the network into multiple parts. Each segment might have its own branch of the blockchain that they're working on until all parts of the network join up again. I'm not aware of such instances having happened yet (but I'd love to find out if there have been any).\n\nFinally, blockchain forks can also be created deliberately. If a group of users decides to adopt different protocol rules, then some blocks may no longer be valid in this new rule set, whereas blocks that are not valid in the original version may be valid with the new rules. As an example: A group of users could decide that they want to make the reward for mining a block 100 BTC instead of the current 6.25 BTC. Miners who join this movement will award themselves 100 BTC in blocks that they mine, but those blocks are only considered valid by the users that have joined this movement. The rest of the network will consider these blocks invalid and will ignore them, favoring blocks mined by miners still following the original rules.\n\nAnd from this point two branches are created: One following the 100 BTC block reward rules and one following the original rules. Unlike the accidental forks, caused by network issues or simultaneous block-mining, such a deliberate fork doesn't automatically resolve itself. The two branches will continue to go their separate way. Eventually, economic forces may drive one branch irrelevant or even extinct when no major players want to support it. But even a small group of users can keep it going. The most well known example of such a fork is the Bitcoin Cash (or BCash or BCH) fork in 2017, when a group of users decided to allow much larger blocks. This branch failed to gain popular support, but still exists as a small player (having made additional changes to the rules since the original fork).\n\nSome deliberate forks are done with large scale support and aren't true forks, because there aren't really multiple branches. For example the recent Taproot update. Taproot changed some rules on how transactions can be formed. But this change was planned well in advance and miners could signal their support and readiness for this change by setting a certain indicator flag in the blocks they mined. The software was programmed in such a way that only when a large fraction of blocks in a 2016 block period (~2 weeks) signaled support would the change \"lock in\" for activation at a later date. This ensured that the change was non-contentious and that while its activation is technically called a fork, it didn't actually result in separate branches coming into being.",

You wait 10 seconds, there has been no movement and you make a forward step 0.5 meters forward.\n\nIt turns out your friend made a step sideways but because of bad internet you didn't see it. The computer character has conflicting information, on your friends computer it has moved sideways, and on yours it moved forwards and now both computers can see that there are 2 versions of the event.\n\nThat is a fork in bitcoin terms, what was the correct step? It turns out it doesn't matter which step was correct, just that only one of them is chosen as the correct one.\n\nGetting into how bitcoin incentivises the network to choose a single path and avoid forks is a more complicated topic, but hopefully I've given you an idea of what a fork is.",

It could, in theory, be empty.\n\nNote that the miner receives the block reward through a special transaction called the \"coinbase transaction\". They can create this transaction and add it to a block that they mine. The coinbase transaction has no inputs and in this way creates coins out of thin air. The rules of the protocol limit how much Bitcoin such a transaction is allowed to pay out and that limit is composed of the newly minted coins (currently 6.25 BTC per block and halving every 4 years) as well as the total fees paid by all the other transactions in the block.\n\nSo even if there are no other transactions, the miner will still always include a coinbase transaction to reward themself for mining the block. Only when the new coin reward goes down to zero after many halvings (which will still take more than a century), will it no longer be useful to include a coinbase transaction if no other transactions are present.\n\nSo in theory, in more than a hundred years from now, it's possible that there's a miner who has no transactions to actually include in a block. And at that point, it would be economical to simply switch off the mining hardware until a fee-paying transaction comes in. But in the scenario, Bitcoin will have failed and there's no point in mining anyway.",

                    "response": "A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an underlying asset (Bitcoin) in this case at a future date at a predetermined price.\n\nI could sell you a futures contract for Bitcoin at $50,000 for June 1st. That means that on June 1st you pay me $50,000 and I deliver to you 1 BTC. Since the current price (or \"spot price\") is now $40,000 (lets round it for this example for convenience), there's a difference between the futures price and the spot price. This phenomenon (futures > spot) is called \"contango\".\n\nNow one could take advantage of this by buying 1 BTC (at spot price, $40K) and selling a futures contract for 1 BTC at $50K and when June 1st comes around, you pocket the difference for a profit of $10K minus some exchange/broker fees.\n\nIf many people would do this (or a few large traders), this would drive up the spot price and drive down the futures price, bringing the two closer together. This process is called arbitrage, where traders profit from a price imbalance and make trades that end up reducing this imbalance.\n\nSo why wouldn't arbitrage cause this price difference to become very small? If there's $10K up for grabs, why wouldn't people jump on it?\n\nThe answer given in the stackexchange post outlines several possible reasons:\n\n1. By making this trade, you're locking your money away until the futures contract expires. In that time, you can't use it as margin for leveraged trading. In fact, you can't use it for anything else at all.\n\n2. Following up on the first point, if you believe that BTC will increase in price more than the $10K, it's better to simply buy BTC and hold that.\n\n3. The third point simply states that it might be difficult to trade and hold BTC. There may simply not be enough people to take advantage of these price differences. If this is the true reason for the contango, then it's an opportunity for someone to exploit. \n\n4. This point is a generalization of #2, namely that there are better things to invest money in during this period.\n\nSo the answer boils down to 2 main reasons: Either not enough people are aware of the difference (and able to act on it), in which case it represents a real opportunity. Or traders, as a whole, expect that the gains are not worth locking in that amount of money for that time period. Typically because there are other trades or investments with a higher expected return.",

If the wallet works and the developer has abandoned it, you can install a different app, send all your coins to your new wallet.

Sorry\\*\\*\\**  \n\n\nOnce you buy with KYC, the selling company and possibly the government, will know forever that you bought bitcoin, and if they are not anonymized, they can also know what your bitcoins are, and consequently monitor all your movements.\n\nThe main reason I find it interesting to do Coinjoin/whirlpool is to be able to unlink my identity from those particular coins, complicating surveillance a bit. This way, the government or the seller will know how much bitcoin you bought but not what you have done with it, which grants you some freedom. However, IMO whirpool and coinjoin have fairly high fees.\n\nI would like to know the pros and cons of the following strategy to anonymize bitcoin. It suggests the use of Lightning network (LN), but as I do not understand very well the traceability of coins in this network I would like you to explain me the problems of this strategy:\n\nThe only prerequisite for this is to download two wallets on your mobile that are able to receive and send bitcoin onchain but also over LN, called wallet A and B. Two wallets that can do this are muun wallet and blue-wallet for example, although there are more.\n\n1.- You buy bitcoin from your usual seller2.- You withdraw bitcoin to your mobile in a wallet (A) that supports both onchain and LN. (you pay the exchange withdrawal fee)3.- You send from wallet A to a wallet B that also accepts LN and you do it via LN (ultra-low fee)3.1.(Optional)- You bounce several times by lightning between wallets A and B at a very reduced cost (does this make sense?)4.- From wallet B, you withdraw onchain to your cold storage.5.- The end.\n\nTo what extent can someone trace the coins or can be sure that they still belong to the same person using this strategy?

Spending directly with a lightning wallet is very private as is or if you need to spend onchain you can go from one liquidity pool to another one with 2 lightning wallets and you are fine. \n\n--------------------\n\nAs long as you don't immediately need to spend the solution is very simple\n\n1) Buy bitcoin (even from a regulated exchange with fees of 0.1% to 0.5%)\n\n2) Withdraw it to temporary wallet A (Example- mobile open source hot wallet)\n\n3) Within 1-4 hours of receiving it in wallet A send to wallet B(example - your hardware wallet) and never send transactions backwards from wallet B to wallet A. Send entire amount every time you do this to insure that the exchange cannot associate your Unique withdrawal addresses with each transaction.\n\nNote- you can technically use a single wallet and use \"coin control \" feature to manually separate out your UTXOs but the above is an idiot proof method to avoid mistakes\n\nWhy?\n\nYou can easily spend Bitcoin privately in many ways , including just using a lightning wallet today . Since you are just concerned about long term privacy you are better off simply creating evidence immediately for plausible deniability that the address you withdrew to (assumed by exchanges and regulators to likely be yours) no longer has the bitcoin and those bitcoin could have been spent , lost, sold , used within a small window of time where no or an insignificant amount of capital gains would have occurred.",

Or if it is the exchange is hacked.\n\n2.- I understand your strategy and I like it, I understand plausible deniability and I think your arguments are strong. However, the coin trace is still totally clear. Suppose that in addition to that plausible deniability I want to cut any link between the exchange and my hardware wallet address: if I add a hopb sending between lightning wallets (without bounces) don't I improve on this one without worsening plausible deniability? \n\n3.- Just to be sure, when you say not to send back from wallet B to wallet A, I imagine you mean to avoid errors. It is impossible to know that two addresses derive from the same private key, isn't it?\n\nThanks!",

You can send Bitcoin directly from an exchange to any person or any merchant. The exchange might guess that it is likely the withdraw address belongs to you but its merely a guess.\n\n>I want to cut any link between the exchange and my hardware wallet address:\n\nThan use coinjoin with something like joinmarket or wasabi or use 2 lightning wallets \n\n> I imagine you mean to avoid errors.

Using that method makes it a dummy proof way vs using coin control",

            "selftext": "I'm looking at DCA'ing BTC from my fortnightly pay. I plan to use the [Bitaroo](https://www.bitaroo.com.au/) exchange as their maker fee is lower than the other Aussie exchanges.\n\nI notice they do BTC withdrawals via Lightning that look to be way cheaper than their standard withdrawal fees (between 0.0001 and 0.0003 BTC). They give a discount when withdrawing to Wallet of Satoshi (0.09%) versus other lightning wallets (0.19%).\n\nSo the question is, what's the best way to go about withdrawing BTC from the exchange to a hardware wallet?\n\nConsidering I'll be purchasing AUD$200 of BTC per fortnight, if I withdraw it straight away I'm paying between $5-18 for standard withdrawals or $0.18-0.38 via lightning. I'm thinking I'd like to withdraw it asap rather than leave it on the exchange but that's not cost effective unless I do lightning withdrawals.\n\nI haven't looked into it in detail but note that WoS is custodial, so let's just cross that off the list.\n\nI looked at Electrum (rather than a mobile wallet) but I don't get how it works with lightning invoicing. I found [this post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5259973.0#post_point4) on [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org) where it says  *Your  inbound capacity depends on if there is any remote balance on any of  the channels.* ***You can't receive payments without spending any coins****.*  \n\nSorry, can someone explain this to me please?\n\nI've only purchased BTC twice so far, both as one offs to try out Kraken and Bitaroo. I've withdrawn both purchases to a Blockstream Green wallet. I haven't yet bought a hardware wallet but am thinking of going with the Bitbox02.\n\nAppreciate any advice on the best way to go about this.",

There were attempts to bootstrap price discovery when New Liberty Standard defined a price based on an estimate of the energy used to mine a block on his laptop. He acknowledged that this calculation was arbitrary and expected that it would be replaced by an interactive price discovery process. Separately, a few months later, the Bitcoin pizza transaction had a price, but that transaction had no price discovery effect  \n\nIn the months following the pizza transaction, a Bitcoin thread on slashdot increased public awareness, and several startup exchanges were launched, including Mtgox. Gradually, the existence of exchanges attracted speculators. People with experience of pumping and dumping penny stocks recognized that a money token which could be easily bought and sold, and which was not encumbered with regulation, is a price manipulation opportunity  \n\nThe speculation activity was (and still is) the only form of price discovery Bitcoin has ever had  \n\nSilk Road came later. Even though Silk Road was a practical use case for Bitcoin, Silk Road had no effect on price discovery. Its users were victims of price volatility. The main effect of Silk Road was that the viral Gawker article alerted other potential Bitcoin users (people who need on-line payments without a gatekeeper) to the fact that Bitcoin solves their payment problem - refusal of service by credit card payment service providers, and by PayPal  \n\nThere's an economic view (see Frances Coppola) that price discovery can only happen through speculation. See https://www.coppolacomment.com/  \nOn the other hand, her interest in Bitcoin mainly focuses on the price market, not the use cases described in the Satoshi paper\n\n> If I sell my neighbor a blade of grass for $1, that just means my neighbor is a sucker because grass is valueless\n\nIf Apple sells you an iPhone for $900, you're a sucker because an iPhone is worth $80.

Exchange fees are always highger because they not just pay miner fee but also have a benefit for the service.  I recommend you to use a non-custodial wallet (not your keys, not your coins) for payments (and for storing, but its not the topic now). \n\n2.- Adresses should never be typed. In the most cases, you can scan QR code direction and always you will be able to copy and paste the adress so you do not have to type (and therefore the possibility of making a mistake). The most important thing is to verify the last 5 characters of the adress, comparing between the source and the place where you copy it. Besides, theres a typo-prevention system (like control digit in bank accounts or IDs) that will show an error message if some character is not correct.  \n\n\nJust copy/scan adress and compare last 5 characters and you will be ok.",

However, although the withdrawal fees at kraken are among the cheapest I have seen (among the major exchanges), it is still considerably more expensive than sending from wallet to wallet paying only the mining fee. That is, if you're only going to make a one-time payment, that's fine, but if you're likely to pay more stuff I'd withdraw a sufficient amount to a wallet of mine (hot or, preferably cold) and make payments from there to pay only the mining fee. Otherwise you are paying in addition the kraken fee. \n\nKraken warns you that it is an exchange and not a wallet because you don't have your private keys in the first place, so you don't actually \"own\" your bitcoin. You have Kraken's promise that the moment you want to withdraw your bitcoin you will be able to do it, but it is only a promise. When you withdraw the bitcoin to your personal wallet then you ARE in possession of the private keys and consequently you can consider those cryptocurrencies yours.",

If there is a problem with your payment from exchange account to third party, then your support request needs to negotiate the problem of working out if the recipient is mistaken, or if Kraken failed to send. It's your problem, but you're not the sender or the recipient  \n\nIf you withdraw to your own wallet, then as the recipient, you can negotiate with Kraken if there are problems with the withdrawal payment. And then, when you send from your own wallet, you have a record of the transaction, the recipient address, fees, and the ability to prove the truth of the transaction to the recipient  \n\nNext year, there will be regulations requiring you to provide the name and address of the recipient, if you send from your exchange account to a third party. Do you know the recipient's name and address? Are you comfortable with the requirement to send this information to an exchange?  \n\nBitcoin is not PayPal. An exchange account is not a wallet. Use your own wallet. Bitcoin wallet apps are free  \nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet",

You can't hold onto the walled in your possession, you have to open up an LLC under your IRA, then you have to buy the coins, and then you have to have someone else custody your coins under the LLC ownership... someone like Coinbase or an attorney... so I am not comfortable with that.\n\nEasiest way, buy Grayscale funds... GBTC, EHTE, GDLC, and Crypto Related funds like BTCR which focus on crypto related companies like MSTR, MARA, CANA, RIOT, etc.\n\nThat is the easiest and most effective way to really own BTC in your IRA or 401K",

I get that the current cap of coins leads people to see it as deflationary. Sure. Ok. Eventually it will be.\n\nBUT... at the moment, ~900 new coins are minted every day. At a (I'm canadian) price of 53000 CAD that means that 48 million dollars are being created everyday. \nI'm trying to do some math and human stats to conceive how this is sustainable. Or how the price stays afloat while the supply is inflated.\n\nI assume that miners are reluctant to sell ALL the new coins they mint. Can someone provide a metric or stat that tracks this?\n\n48 million dollars worth of BTC is created and rewarded every day. Divided by say 100 of the largest metropolitan cities in the world... it would need to equal 20-25 people dumping $25k in... every day.\n\nI'm struggling with accepting that Bitcoin is deflationary when 900 new coins are created every day and want to see how much investment is being added in every day.\nHelp. Please link or explain metrics and stats which make this picture clearer.\n\nJust because any crypto has an eventual cap doesn't make it deflationary in the short or medium term.",

You should do the same calculation but in btc instead of $.\n\nRegarding the store of value vs actual money... we are only at the beginning of the adoption so it is kind of normal. Institionnal just started to invest a small part of their asset in btc. So I guess if more people used it it can be use as a mean of exchange. Just look last year, El Salvatore declare btc as legal tender, you could buy a pizza there with btc. They are btc enthusiasts compared to our governments. Our governments are addicted to money printing without it they would have to reduce their spending and they don't want that, instead of taxing more the citizen to finances the governments they print money and the people pay right now a tax called inflation.\n\nThere are a lot of countries in the world that used usd as a currency. So these countries are affected by the inflation caused by the US money policy (like El Savatore). These countries some day will wake up and might used another currency like btc to prevent themselves against bad money policy.\n\nI have no crystal ball nobody sees the future but I think btc will have a great future maybe not short term but in the long term it could have the power to create a world currency not affected by any government.",

You can only request and send money from/to another strike account.\n\n\nWhether the counter-party gets crypto, fiat or beans is irrelevant to me. From my perspective, Strike is just a $-based payment system where they promise BTC as the backing for $ I have on deposit. I'm taking the risk that if BTC goes up in value a lot, they don't actually own enough BTC to back their debts.",

                    "response": "A few points to consider:\n\n1) The sender pays the transaction fee , thus when you withdraw bitcoin from an exchange or custodian any fee that you have is not a bitcoin fee but a withdraw fee . Exchanges sometimes charge excessive fees as exit taxes for nefarious reasons up to over 25 dollars, and other exchanges have reasonable withdraw fees of 1 usd , and others have free withdraw fees . Look at the pinned FAQ for the exchange chart to see some of the fees\n\n2) You can choose to pay whatever fee you want when sending the bitcoin onchain down to as low as 1 sat per byte (6-20 cents) , the lower the fee the less transaction priority in getting a quick confirmation \n\nThe correlation between larger txs(thus larger tx fees) has more to do with dust (you received many small txs into your wallet instead of a single one) and nothing to do with the value of the tx directly (although very valuable txs typically are larger because they need to cover multiple inputs to fund the total amount, but not necessarily)\n\nThus a tx of 1 million usd in BTC can technically have a lower tx fee (because the weight/size is smaller ) than a BTc tx worth 50 USD (because its filled with dust)\n\nHere is some advice:\n\n1) Batching when you can (electrum and core wallets has sentomany built in )\n\n2) send from native bech32 segwit addresses (your BTC address starts with bc1) https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption\n\n3) Follow the fee market and manually set thee right priority https://twitter.com/CoreFeeHelper\n\n4) Make sure you use a wallet that uses RBF (Replace by fee) so you can easily bump the fee if need be. Examples are Bitcoin core, electrum, blockstream green, so you can set the fee very low manually and than bump it up as needed\n\nMore info - https://bitcoinops.org/en/rbf-in-the-wild/\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Techniques_to_reduce_transaction_fees#opt-in_transaction_replacement\n\n\n5) Exchanges like swan, gemini active trader, strike , and cash app pay the withdrawal onchain fee for you\n\n\n6) Where possible use lightning wallets and transactions which have fees below 1 penny USD \u2013 phoenix and breez are popular lightning wallets",

And I don't have time to audit their code to convince myself of that.\n\nWorse yet, it's normalizing typing your password for one site into another site. Even if it really is an iframe directly to your bank, that distinction will be lost on 99% of users. It won't be long before services you pretty much have to use (like the IRS) and aren't security at all demand that you put credentials for things you care about into some site you don't trust. Imagine trying to get back into the country and immigration demands you enter your Gmail or Facebook credentials into their computer. Or an employer demands it before hiring or even interviewing you.\n\nCredentials are between you and one provider. Anything else and you give up control. The time to make quick bank on BTC has likely passed, so if you're not here to maintain control over your finances, you're in the wrong place.",

Record the seed on paper (and eventually also steel), then save the zpub and reboot Tails to set it up as a watch-only wallet. This requires some care to make sure you set it up right and never connect to the internet while the seed is stored on it.\n\nThe above is a great temporary option while you are waiting for a hardware wallet (to ship or while still choosing which one is right for you). The hardware wallet gives you more flexibility and security if you ever need to move or spend from that wallet, since you can sign transactions without entering the seed onto the device creating and broadcasting the transaction.",

You do not own any Bitcoin but \"IOUs\". (legally you own the bitcoin but practically you don't as the law will not help you in most cases and can and often will be used against you) You have little privacy and your bitcoin is in control of someone else that has their own private keys/seeds which you do not have that reserve your Bitcoin. The bitcoin you own might not exist or may be fractional as well diluting the supply of Bitcoin and decreasing the ability of your investment to appreciate in value. Keeping bitcoin in exchanges also makes Bitcoin more insecure as a whole from attacks and theft. \n\n**Non - Custodial wallets**\n\nYou have the Bitcoin in your private wallet and no one knows your privatekey/seed backup but you. You actually own your own Bitcoin. \n\n------------------------------------------\n**Hot wallets vs Warm Wallets vs Cold wallets**\n\n**Hot wallet** - wallet connected to the internet. \n\nExamples - mobile wallets , web wallets , wallets in exchanges, desktop wallets  \n\n**Warm wallet** - wallet indirectly connected to the internet but a piece of hardware tries to isolate the private keys and transaction signing \n\nExamples - hardware wallets. wallets like cold card with PSBTs offer slightly better security than other HW wallets when used correctly  \n\n**cold wallet** - wallet not connected to the internet \n\nExamples - paper wallets(all new paper wallets should use 12-24 seed words instead of private keys), offline laptop that never connects to the internet with a wallet, , hardware wallets not connected to the internet\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Closed source vs Open source**\n\n**Closed source wallets** - Code for your wallet is not publicly available and auditable by third parties. This allows backdoors and exploits that internal employees or external attackers can exploit and really undermines the security and ideals of decentralization as you must have faith in the company or wallet developers.\n\nWhy use cryptocurrency at all if you have to have faith in a single company or developer?\n\n**Open source wallets** - wallets that allow the source code to be independently audited and peer reviewed and freedom to continue developing the wallet even if the original developers disappear. While not immune from software bugs and exploits (as all code is vulnerable to) open source code gives better transparency and security. You might not be able to understand and audit the code but many other can and will and be able to warn you if a backdoor or exploit exists.\n\nhttps://walletscrutiny.com/",

If all your bitcoin is on one address then anyone you send to can see the entire balance and history of that address. It would be like letting somone look at your bank account everytime you bought something on your debit card. The only way to save on fees later is to consolidate UTXOs onto a single address when fees are low but this can also degrade your privacy. At the end of the day it is up to you to determine the balance between privacy and lower fees but remember that the blockchain is forever. Maybe today you do not care about using bitcion as private as possible but that might prevent you from regaining any privacy later on. If you find UTXO managment difficult maybe look into a wallet with coin control, like electrum, so that you can label UTXO's. This also allows you to instruct the wallet to only spend certain UTXOs and keeps them from getting mixed up.",

If you have 5 utxos instead of 1 utxo the onchain fee for sending BTC would be ~8-10 cents instead of ~6-8 cents for 1 sat a byte and does this onchain fee really matter if its used to open a lightning channel where those fees are spread across many txs?\n\n>It's much too difficult for full on normies at this point. \n\nThe concerns you bring up have little to do with the difficulty in \"normies\" using bitcoin .

Then with coin control I can move my coins orderly to my new passphrase.\n\nI have a trezor one and an added risk is that you have to type your passphrase in your PC, so to make this new \"move\" I would like to do it in a more secure device for my passphrase.\n\n2.- I have heard that it can be risky to search your addresses or transactions in blockchain explorers because you may be compromising your privacy:\n\nIs it safe enough if I look it up from TOR or from browsers that allow browsing TOR (Brave)?\n\nThanks",

They do their own research and so draw their own conclusions.\n\nPeople like yourself who assert to people \"Just buy it\" are the reasons people either view Bitcoin as a gonzo scheme, or invest without knowing why (and so end up panic selling at a dip).",

                    "response": "Bitcoin wallets can be sorted into two categories. Custodial wallets and non-custodial wallets. Custodial wallets are like unsecured bank accounts. Kind of like banks in the old west. When you put your money in a custodial wallet, the company that runs that wallet has your actual money, but you have access to it. If a \u201cbank robber\u201d (aka hacker) robs the old West Bank (custodian) you\u2019re out of luck.\n\nNow usually banks have better security than you normally do, so it might be ok, but there\u2019s nobody to complain to if the custodian gets hacked. Your money is gone. Most exchanges' wallet (coinbase, kraken, etc.) is this kind of wallet.\n\nA non-custodial wallet puts you in full control. You\u2019re responsible for security, and if you lose the wallet no biggie, as long as you have your secure \u201ckeys\u201d saved somewhere. Keys to a bitcoin wallet are represented by a series of random words that you can write down or memorize.\n\nAs long as you never digitize these words (no pics, no email, etc) just in your head or on paper, you cannot lose your money, and nobody can take it from you by hacking. There is a saying in bitcoin circles: \u201cNot your keys? Not your coin.\u201d\n\nFor small amounts of bitcoin, a custodial wallet is no problem. I keep a little bitcoin in a custodial wallet like cash app or coinbase because it\u2019s convenient. For larger amounts of bitcoin, I would highly recommend using a non-custodial wallet.\n\nHere\u2019s a good rule of thumb. Only keep an amount of bitcoin in a custodial wallet that you would feel comfortable with in your real wallet. So if you carry around $100 in your wallet, no biggie. If you lose your wallet, it\u2019s gonna suck, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. Now if you had $5k , you probably wouldn\u2019t carry that in your wallet.\n\nSo if you ever get to the point that the bitcoin you have is worth more than you would carry in your wallet, you should move it to a non-custodial wallet where you control the keys. https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html\n\nIf this is a \"medium\" amount of money like a month or two of salary, a non-custodial wallet on your phone is fine.\n\nIf it starts climbing into a 6-12 month salary or more, I'd recommend a hardware wallet. I really like the Trezor.\n\nOnce you get a non-custodial wallet, be sure to protect those seed words they give you for backup. That is your bitcoin, not the hardware device or your phone. If you have those seed words safely stored somewhere, you can recover from any hardware loss.\n\nIf you want to go really secure, stamp those words in metal. I like these cause they aren't expensive: https://crypto-keys.com/pages/jameson-lopp-test\n\nBe sure to never digitize those words. Don't take a pic, dont put them on a computer, etc.. Write them on paper (The trezor comes with cards for this) at a minimum, and put them somewhere secure. If you do use paper, make sure they are in waterproof and fireproof envelopes. If you do decide to go with a hardware wallet, buy it directly from the manufacturer. If its tamper evident seals are broken, don't use it.",

Where the key (our shifted alphabet) is used to go both ways, encrypt and decrypt.  \n\nCrypto uses what is called a asymmetric encryption. Where one key can be used to encrypt and another key used to decrypt, and the inverse is true.  \n\nIn a encryption system like pgp, your private key is used to encrypt a message, that only the pubic key can be used to decrypt, aka signing, anyone can decrypt with the public key which proves it came from the private key holder.  \nWith the inverse, anyone can encrypt with the public key that only the private key can decrypt.  \n\nOnce upon a time, a Bitcoin user would use a random number as their private key, then from there create their public key. Both keys were then turned into addresses, basically another written format that represents the same number.  \n\nAn issue people were having was change addresses, other keys would be created for receiving your change back, and some would forget to make a new backup that had this new key.  \n\nBitcoin doesn't have denominations like a $5 bill, or $10 bill. Instead it has the unspent transaction output, utxo (an output from the other person to you, is an input, but we define it as an output from them that you haven't spent yet). Technically, you can view utxo's as your denominations.  \n\nA miner transaction fee is any Bitcoins you don't specify where you are sending. Pretty much, if you sign to send 0.8 coins to an address, but don't specify the other 0.2, you are leaving it for grabs by the miner. So what you would do is specify the amount you intend to keep, to an address you control, your change address.  \n\nHD wallets intended to solve this not having all your keys in a backup. So instead of picking a random number each time, it follows a design on how to create a new number. This is the \"D\" in HD, deterministic. The \"H\" stands for heirarchy, pretty much tiers, or levels of generation.  \n\nNow instead of picking a random number for a private key, you pick a random number to pick words from a list. These words are then hashed to create a new number, your seed, which is then hashed again (against the phrase \"Bitcoin seed\") create another number, which is your root. \n\nThis root is now your master key, denoted by lower case \"m\" and your chain code. You can extend this master key into your master private key by hashing with rules for this depth and type of key.  \n\nFrom these two components, basically splitting this large number in half into the left bits and right bits, the master key and chain code. You follow the rules to get to the layer you want, the derivation path.  \n\nAt this point, you can create your private key and pubic key pair.  \n\nMain point. Instead of a picking a random number to use as a key every time, and having to remember to make backups every time. You can regenerate the keys you need if you have a starting point and follow the path you chose. Paths have become more defined so you don't need to remember the path, just look up the default paths for the wallet you used.",

It has the same problem as the Wiki page linked in the other comment - fails to make the distinction between policy verification rules and consensus rules. They're mostly the same  \n\nPolicy rules are applied by nodes when they receive unconfirmed transactions. They block non-standard transactions, which are permitted in consensus. They also block some replacement transactions, and allow replace-by-fee. Policy rules block low-fee transactions. Consensus does not care about fee amounts  \n\nPolicy rules only consider each unconfirmed transaction, on its own and in the context of other unconfirmed transactions in the node's mempool  \n\nConsensus rules also consider the context of transactions within a block, where two or more transactions can have a parent-child relationship. The block is rejected if parent-child pairs are in the wrong order  \n\nUnder \"Independent Verification of Transactions\" in Mastering Bitcoin, the list of rules are policy rules. Further down, \"Validating a New Block\" has a list of rules for the block and the coinbase transaction, and a back reference to the policy rules, \"All transactions within the block are valid using the transaction checklist discussed in Independent Verification of Transactions\"  \n\nThere are policy rules which are not consensus - non-standard transactions, minimum fee, minimum output amount (dust rule), RBF. There are consensus rule which are not policy rules - the order of parent-child pairs within a block",

When you add more (investors) to that pond it divides the resource, while that adds value to those who have it....it also makes future purchases smaller (fractional).\n\nAt what point do the decimals go too far to the right?

Your future recovery will need to be done using Electrum.\n\n- When you eventually want to spend the bitcoin, you'll should recover it in a secure way to send an outgoing transactions without exposing your private keys to an internet-connected computer.

The actual amount depends on how stable your income is (employment vs independent contractor). Have this stashed in a savings account. Sure, this money won\u2019t grow but it also won\u2019t drop 30% in value because of a market scare unlike crypto. You wouldn\u2019t enjoy having an emergency and having to sell your crypto when market is down just because you need cash immediately, would you? With efund stashed, the tactic depends on your risk tolerance really. I will treat crypto as a small part of my portfolio for fun because I have a very low risk tolerance but I personally know some people who put all their money in crypto a few years back and profited big time so it really comes down to what you are comfortable with.",

But since we humans aren't so good at correctly writing down and entering large numbers, some people decided it would be easier to just use words instead. So the list of 24 words is a human-friendly way to represent that very large number, your seed.\n\nThe thing you need to spend your funds are private keys. But a private key is also just a very large number. So if we wanted to make it very easy, we could just say that the private key is the same as the seed. We can convert it into a set of words, for ease of use for us humans, but behind all of it it's just a big number. Simple.\n\nBut this limits us to a single private key. Every time we want to use a new address (which should be for every transaction), we'd have to write down a new list of 24 words. That's not great. So how about we instead make each next private key a function of the previous one? We let the first private key be equal to the seed, but then each next private key is simply the previous one plus 1. So if our first private key is 12345, the second would be 12346, the third 12347 and so forth.\n\nSuch an approach allows us to start with a single number (the seed) and generate an unlimited list of private keys.\n\nThat is, extremely roughly speaking, how seeds work in Bitcoin. Note that here I used \"+ 1\" as the formula to calculate the next private key. This is very easy to understand, but also has a lot of problems. For example as soon as just one private key in the sequence is leaked, the finder can immediately find the other private keys by just looking at the previous and next numbers.\n\nIn reality, a complicated mathematical function is used that takes the seed as an input and gives private keys as an output.\n\nWhen you restore a seed on a new device or app, the wallet will start to generate private keys with that seed and for each one it'll also generate the matching public address and it'll look that up in the blockchain to find its transaction history and final balance. By iterating through the private keys and associated addresses, the wallet can reconstruct your old transaction history and balance. Eventually, it'll hit a streak of addresses that never had any activity and at that point the wallet will assume it has hit the end of what you've used before and will stop.",

There are two keys, a public and a private.\n\nThe private key is your wallet. (Your seeds actually generates lots of private keys, but you can ignore that detail for a conceptual level understanding.)\n\nThe public key is stored on the distributed database that is the blockchain. We all have read access, but only the fastest compute power can modify it. And the collection of all bitcoin miners should always be the fastest compute power.\n\nThe other thing that makes a bitcoin hack less likely is that were it hacked, word would get around very quickly and its value would go to zero, so the thief would be left with nothing valuable. It's as if a bank had currency made of flash paper that ignited if it were removed from the vault without permission. But magic flash paper that cause all the magic currency in the entire world to ignite if any of it were removed from the vault.\n\nI suppose governments will have motivation to hack bitcoin when it starts displacing fiat. Or hostile foreign governments might have motivation to hack crypto if their adversaries relied more on that coin than they did. Or someone who had shorted crypto would want to. But your average thief just wants your private key, and relies on the system itself remaining secure.",

                    "response": "> Is a wallet app only accessible on one device at a time or can you log in and out from multiple places at any time?\n\nThat depends on the type of wallet application.\n\nThe critical piece of data are the \"private keys\" that allow you to spend your funds. Most modern wallets store these in the form of something akin to a \"master private key\", which is called the \"seed\". In principle, you can use this seed on as many devices as you'd like and have each device be able to fully control your funds, but the more devices that store this seed, the greater the risk of someone else gaining access to it.\n\nInstead, some wallet implementations allow you to create \"watch-only\" wallets, that let you monitor your funds, but not control them. So you could have your seed stored securely on one device (such as a hardware wallet), but with a watch-only version on several other devices, letting you check your funds all the time, while keeping the seed as secure as possible.\n\nFinally, there are custodial wallets. These wallets place the keys in the hands of someone else, the company running the service. You can log in through a webpage from anywhere and both monitor and manage your funds. The main downside of custodial wallets is that you're at the mercy of the wallet operator. If they decide to not like you anymore or to go out of business completely, you lose access to your funds. So while convenient to use, custodial wallets are not recommended for anything beyond small amounts of spending money.\n\n> If you have a hardware wallet does it need to be \"online\" to receive coins at the time of the transaction?\n\nNo. The coins aren't sent to the hardware wallet. The device only holds the keys to access the coins.\n\n> If you buy coins from say a coinbase exchange, and receive coins from other sources, what is the best way to see your current totals and value, and keep track of the transactions?\n\nMost wallet applications will show you an overview of transactions and account balances. If you just want to see what you've received and sent and when, as well as your current balance, then pretty much all wallets will do that for you as that is quite basic functionality.",

Otherwise , the fees can be reasonable if the sender already has bitcoin or want to invest in bitcoin anyways and is only sending a small portion of their btc . **Transaction Fees**(not gas) in a lightning wallet is 0 to a fraction of a penny to send btc for an instant confirmation. \n\nIf the OP is wanting to use bitcoin once and never again and both people are banked and don't need privacy than it might not make any sense to use btc",

If you're not in a hurry, submit a low-price buy order and go to sleep. If the order is still unfilled when you wake up, decide if you want to wait longer. If you don't want to wait, delete the order. Submit a new one",

Indirectly, you also delegate power to that full node to enforce bitcoin's rules for you.  \n\nSo it's in your own interests to have your wallet connected to your own full node (better privacy, you don't have to trust to third parties etc). Umbrel gives you that option, including some other services that you can run on top of the node (Lightning network, Joinmarket etc). You can do all that for free on your own hardware, Umbrel is just a paid (optional) service to make it easier for you.  \n\n> Also does it involve mining?  \n\nNo, a miner is a different thing. They mine blocks, and your full node checks if those blocks are valid.",

Then you market it as being able to be more private without the worry of \"tainting\" your bitcoin. You package the coordinator into an exchange like they do with bull bitcoin and you collect coordinator fees.",

It relies on false logic - it is possible to calculate the current per-Bitcoin cost of mining, therefore the price of Bitcoin is prevented from falling below that cost. It's false because the cost is variable in both directions. In turn, this is because there is an automatic difficulty adjustment designed to target a constant block interval - 10 minutes. The \"expert\" sphere is full of people who are too stupid to understand the Bitcoin automatic mining difficulty adjustment. The writer of that book is one of those fools",

In reality, this period will differ somewhat (when hash rate is increasing, the difficulty adjustments come somewhat more frequently than every 2 weeks, when it's decreasing the adjustments are spaced apart a bit more).\n\nIf mining is no longer lucrative for a given miner, they will turn off their equipment and the network hash rate will decrease, resulting in a reduction of the difficulty. This will increase the profitability for all remaining miners. Through this mechanism, the hash rate will eventually always end up at a point where mining is profitable for all active miners, but with small margins only. If the margins get too high, more people start to invest in mining hardware, pushing up the difficulty and driving down profitability. And vice versa if margins are negative for many miners.\n\nSo the mining hash rate follows the price of Bitcoin and not the other way around.\n\nNote that this following behavior is much faster in one direction than it is in the other. If the price were to crash by 50% today, it won't take miners with relatively high costs very long to turn off their equipment. However, if the price suddenly jumps by 50%, there won't be a whole lot of mining hardware suddenly appearing out of thin air. Some might be able to dust off some outdated equipment and get it back into the fray, but that won't make a big impact on network hash rate. It takes time for new hardware to be produced and deployed before the hash rate catches up to the price in the case of a rapid increase.",

Bitcoin are entries in the public blockchain. Wallets hold keys to bitcoin. You can keep your keys wherever you want for as long as you want...providing you can maintain access to them.\n\n>What if the company stops producing it and the technology has changed?\n\nHardware wallets use a recovery seed format known an BIP39. The same recovery seed can be shared or transferred between different wallets. It's an open and well documentation format. It doesn't rely on any single manufacture being active. Software wallets for your phone or PC can also import BIP39 seeds.\n\nEven if new seed formats are developed and become popular, there will always be support for the current format since it's so widely used.\n\n>Won't your bitcoin there disappear if you try to restore it to another Keepkey \n\nIf you import your recovery seed into another hardware wallet, the first wallet is not affected at all. Both wallets are active and have access to the same funds.\n\n>Can you access your bitcoin there in some other ways if in case you lose it or you forgot your pin?\n\nThat's what the recovery seed is for. Ultimately all you need is the recovery seed. If your device is lost/stolen/broken/inaccessible then you can import your recovery seed into another wallet. If you lose both your device/pin AND your recovery seed then you're screwed.",

Please read this in the FAQ-\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/g42ijd/faq_for_beginners/fouo3kh/\n\n>This beats the idea of hardware security\n\nYou are conflating cold storage with a hot/warm wallet that is actively used. Wallets necessarily use cold storage as well for backups. \n\n> I want a hardware device that controls the transactions regardless of whether someone else got my phrase, they need to push a button on my device to authorize the transaction.\n\nThe passphrase feature found in most hardware wallets accomplishes this and more.(provides a decoy wallet for coercion/torture)\n\n>alot of crypto from so called safe hardware wallets like Nano S and X yet they never shared their seed phrase anywhere.\n\nThis usually happens because of user error from the following methods:\n\n1) They do share the seed phrase because they place it somewhere digitally= encrypted in the cloud, a digital photo , in a password manager instead of following instructions and only keeping the backup physically on paper or metal \n\n2) They lie or forget and enter their seed words in a web wallet prompted by a phishing email telling them that they need to update a wallet like metamask \n\n3) They don't properly use their hw wallet and confirm the address on the hw wallet and send the btc to the wrong address created by malware on their computer \n\n4) they invest in scam altcoins and send their btc or other coins to different addresses by mistakes as they are using multicoin wallets. Messing with altcoins and multicoin wallets not only greatly increases your attack surface from bugs and exploits but allows for many mistakes to occur that lead to loss of coins \n\n5) They do not use the passphrase feature and or leave their backup words in an unsecure location",

Keys are how ownership is proven. \n\nThe seed does not ship inside the device. The device generates a seed during setup. You can reset it and get a new seed at any time and you effectively have a new wallet with new keys. \n\nThe only way to do what you\u2019re asking is to keep only your hardware wallet and discard the seed. This way the private keys only exist within the memory of the hardware wallet.\n\nThe problem here is that if your hardware fails (like any electronic device can), or gets destroyed or stolen etc\u2026.then your funds are permanently unrecoverable.\n\nSo you can get a hardware wallet and burn the seed after the setup process.

Send entire amount every time you do this to insure that the exchange cannot associate your Unique withdrawal addresses with each transaction.\n\nNote- you can technically use a single wallet and use \"coin control \" feature to manually separate out your UTXOs but the above is an idiot proof method to avoid mistakes\n\nWhy?\n\nYou can easily spend Bitcoin privately in many ways , including just using a lightning wallet today . Since you are just concerned about long term privacy you are better off simply creating evidence immediately for plausible deniability that the address you withdrew to (assumed by exchanges and regulators to likely be yours) no longer has the bitcoin and those bitcoin could have been spent , lost, sold , used within a small window of time where no or an insignificant amount of capital gains would have occurred.\n\n------------------\n\nBuying bitcoin p2p is the least expensive with a DEX (Decentralized exchange) like Bisq but more complicated to use , there is still a premium that occurs and a larger spread and less liquidity as well. Buying bitcoin privately without ID at an ATM has fees ranging from 6-30% higher and in person p2p fees 7% or higher due to the cost of someone elses time.

What I don\u2019t understand is how every miner gets profit from these block rewards. Does only one mining machine get the right sequence of numbers giving all 6.25 BTC to that one person who owns that one miner? Is this why most people who mine that are not large scale join a pool to split the profit? If anyone could please explain how every miner profits from the block reward and transaction fees aswell.

This way you get more consistent payouts \n\n>Is this why most people who mine that are not large scale join a pool to split the profit?\n\nyes",

In that block, they also record that they receive 6.25 BTC and that they receive all the fees given by transactions.\n\nDifferent miners will have different blocks, but none of them are yet valid. None of them will be accepted by the rest of the network. They need \"proof of work\".\n\nThis is a number that guessed and added onto the block until a SHA256 hash of the block is smaller than a fixed number. This is the thing that is hard to do. The number is always unique for every miner, you can't find the number and then another miner copies it because the contents of their block is slightly different (sending the reward to their own address).\n\nOnce a valid block is found, the miner sends it out to the network to let everyone else know and we all will validate it before adding it to our records. If the reward is too high, we reject it, if too low, we don't care (this has happened before), if it includes a double spend, we reject it, so on and so on.\n\nSo a miner has to do this proof of work, but if they cheat in any way, then all that work was in vain anyway and other miners will also know this and continue to solve their own blocks.\n\nIf the block is valid, other miners are now playing catchup. If they don't accept the block and build on top of it, they will be left behind so they all immediately move on.\n\nSo the point is that the network doesn't reward you, you reward yourself and the network of individuals running Bitcoin nodes permit you to do it as long as you don't cheat.\n\nOne thing to note, there is a set time (set in blocks) that a miner must wait before spending their reward becomes allowable. This is just another rule built into the Bitcoin protocol and it removes the questions about what happens if a miner spends their rewards and a fork happens... the miner can't spend it until it is basically impossible for a fork to affect their reward.",

Also much smarter to buy with coinbase advanced trader to reduce fees\n\n2) \"download coinbase wallet app\"\n\nVery poor advice. Some scammers prefer this app because they have a dapp for \"liquidity mining\" which is a scam. You should avoid this app and stick with open source Bitcoin apps listed in the FAQ \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/g42ijd/faq_for_beginners/\n\u200b\n>I'm just skeptical about losing my money \n\nBitcoin is a fine investment , but you should be skeptical and slow down and read the FAQ and learn more before investing.

In order to guarantee the returns he's been suggesting would require very risky plays, and so he's giving you the rosiest picture. This happens all the time.\n\nAs someone who is invested in Bitcoin myself, I would just disgard your friend's advice entirely (even though his instructions for opening an account are fairly accurate). Trying to mimic his proposed expectations will either lose you money, or pressurise you to get others to sign up.\n\nNow with that being said, if you happen to be interested in Bitcoin (being honest, it sounds like your interest is only the result of FOMO induced by your friend, and so outside of this it doesn't feel like you have a burning interest in getting to know about crypto. But if you do then it's good to do some research, and remove the idea of it being a get-rich-quick-scheme.",

I mean, he could be making money, but you can also lose money if you don't know what you are doing. There are also plenty of ways to be scammed, here are a few ways:\n\n- Downloading the wrong app or getting the download link from your friend only to find out it is a scam app (Coinbase isn't a scam, some people do make apps that look similar to popular apps to scam people)\n\n- Receiving a phishing email where someone asks you to log in via a link and you end up giving away your Coinbase password to someone else who then steals your money.\n\n> I'm just skeptical about losing my money or how easy it is to cash out\n\nYou should be skeptical about losing money, but cashing out is easy.\n\nDon't rush into things, don't fall victim of thinking that you need to invest now or miss out, plenty of people years ago thought they had truly missed the boat back when they started investing in Bitcoin. People who invest today look up to those people thinking they got in early.\n\nTake your time, invest a little and expect to lose it. Learn by doing and only invest more when you are confident that you know what you are doing. Don't rely on others, at least rely on multiple people for information, because if you just listen to one person, then they may be scamming you and you'd never know it until it was too late.",

IMPORTANT\nSince you\u2019re really concerned about security you should understand this as the MOST IMPORTANT THING. The ledger is NOT your wallet!! The 24 word seed phrase is ur wallet NEVER save those 24 words to any phone/laptop in any way (file, note, or picture) ONLY keep them on paper & in multiple locations. DO NOT write \u201ccrypto wallet\u201d or anything too descriptive on your seed phrase paper and consider not using the paper ledger provided (though few people recognize the paper there is a slim chance). If some one else has those words it\u2019s their wallet.",

So I exported the xpub key from my Ledger Live wallet and imported it into Electrum as a master key. This sort of works, but Electrum assumes p2pkh and lists the BIP32 path as \"unknown\". Of course, I get different addresses, one of which I sent a small amount of funds to before I noticed they didn't even start with 'bc1q'.\n\nAnyway, it's not enough to delay my retirement, but I'm curious to know if it's recoverable. If I import my seed into electrum, will it guess common derivation paths and likely find the right one? I'm hesitant to do so because that was supposed to be a seed/private key that remained forever offline, so I'll have to generate a new one and reset my Ledger wallet.",

If you're unlucky, it will find the coins in your SegWit wallet (if there are any) first\n\n> I'll have to generate a new one and reset my Ledger wallet\n\nProbably. You've got a good chance of success if you choose p2pkh and m/44'/0'/0' while running Electrum off-line, and then eye-check whether one of  the addresses matches the one which received the coin. This path is fiddly and time-consuming, and the wallet might persist on your PC disk anyway  \n\nOutside my experience: I've read a few times that Ledger has an option to generate a one-off Legacy address. There's a chance it will generate the same address as your Electrum watch-only wallet, and the coin will magically appear in your Ledger wallet  \n\nFWIW, Electrum accepts a zpub for creating SegWit watch-only wallets. No idea if Ledger can supply a zpub",

(Optional, but I'm paranoid and if you use BTC you should be too.)\n\n2. Create a new Electrum wallet by recovering from your seed.\n\n* For the type, choose legacy (p2pkh) (this is what Electrum forces when you import an xpub)\n* For the derivation path, choose m/84'/0'/0'. This is what Ledger uses, but that info isn't part of the xpub I imported into Electrum.\n\n3. Verify the first key in the new wallet matches the one you transferred to by checking against your online computer with the broken watch-only copy of your Ledger wallet. It won't show the balance because you're offline.\n\n4. Right-click the address and choose \"Private Key\". This should give you something like \"ptpkh:abc123....\". Note that this option is only available with legacy/p2pkh addresses. I'm not sure why.\n\n5. Save the key to USB or your media of choice. Consider encrypting with GPG if there's lots of BTC there.\n\n6. Back online, create a new wallet in Electrum. Choose \"Import Bitcoin Addresses or Private Keys\". Paste the key there.\n\nYou can now transfer that BTC so the location of your choosing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also figured out how to create a watch-only copy of my Ledger wallet in Electrum.\n\n1. Set up your regular Ledger wallet in Electrum.\n2. Under Wallet->Information, get the zpub key.\n3. Create a new Electrum wallet, choosing \"Import Bitcoin Addresses or Private Keys\" and paste the zpub there.\n\nNow you have no more need for nasty Ledger Live, and you can view your Ledger balance without plugging in your Ledger.",

I also recently set up a Muun Wallet that I\u2019m keeping with a small amount, maybe $200 or so. \n\nOk. Questions: I know I can set up my Ledger as a new wallet with a new seed phrase, but is it possible to have my BTC on TWO or possibly more wallets? So, keeping my SecuX and also having the Ledger? \nSame keys, different wallets?  I\u2019m thinking This probably won\u2019t work, so is it possible to use the seed phrase I already have on the new Ledger?\n\nThanks for helping me sort this out.",

You can earn bitcoin with whatever you are skilled at, you can mine it at home (depending on your location), you can find peers to buy it from through your personal network, you can use a bitcoin ATM or other services that are non-KYC (Azteco, Hodlhodl, Bisq) and so on.  \n\nSo yes, it is possible to be fully anonymous when using bitcoin.

It compares the current rates between Bitcoin and other coins on exchanges that don't require KYC or even a sign up.

You have a wallet and that wallet has a password. Is that it? All you need is your password to make payments and so on? And you can have multiple wallets?\n\n3. Are the main apps like crypto.com a fast way to convert crypto to fiat currency in a bank account? Like how long does it take to transfer X bitcoin to Euros in a normal bank?\n\nThanks very much",

Bitcoin can fluctuate 1-5% daily in volatility on average but sometimes we see more like the ~10% jump like we say yesterday\n\nIf you spend and replace bitcoin like many of us do it solves 2 concerns : Not having regrets about missing out on any gains and not effected by volatility as you are merely using bitcoin as a payment rail to save money in stores like :\n\nhttp://ln.pizza  - save 6 % off dominoes Pizza in the USA with lightning wallet\n\nhttps://purse.io  Save 10-20% off amazon \n\nhttps://foldapp.com - save up to 20%  Starbucks, Uber, Target , whole foods , Dunkin \n\nhttps://www.lolli.com \u2013 save up to 30% by spending BTC anywhere but primarily USA stores\n\nhttps://stekking.com - save up to 20% by spending BTC anywhere but primarily Europe stores\n\n\n2) I suggest you watch at least two of the wallet videos in the pinned FAQ \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/g42ijd/faq_for_beginners/\n\nOne of the videos of a mobile wallet where you have a pin and backup seed word list and the other from a hardware wallet where you have a pin + hw wallet + sometimes passphrase. You should read about the importance in keeping your backup seed words private and secure\n\n>And you can have multiple wallets?\n\nAs many as you want \n\n3) Avoid that exchange as they are running a ponzi and might be fractional and have very high fees .

Because it is still new, and business decides how it's going to use it, and government talks about regulating it, it is going to continue to be a sort of roller coaster.  \n\n2.  The wallet has a key.  once you decide what other wallet you are going to make a payment to, it will ask for your key.  Which is a sort of password, so NEVER give it out.  If a person gets your address and your key, they can get access to your wallet.\n\n3.  It is usually pretty instant once you have USD/Euro in the exchange to go from that to bitcoin and back again.  Getting from your bank to the exchange depends on how you move the money.  ACH is slow.  Wire is fast.  Debit Card is in the middle.",

Transactie kosten als je al crypto munten bezit. \n2. Transactie kosten als je euro's nog op je bank staan.\n3. Transactie kosten tussen platformen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. ( Kosten vergeleken met 10 USDC naar BTC. )\n\nTop 3 goedkoopste platformen:\n\n**- Kucoin.** ( Kosten:  \u20ac0,02 )\n\n**- Swissborg.** ( Kosten:  \u20ac0,03 )\n\n**- Celcius.** ( Kosten:  \u20ac0,04 )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. ( Kosten vergeleken met  \u20ac1000,- van bank naar platform naar BTC. )\n\n**- Bitvavo** ( Kosten:  \u20ac6,15 )\n\n**- FTX** ( Kosten:  \u20ac9,76 )\n\n**- Swissborg** ( Kosten:  \u20ac12,69 )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. ( Kosten vergeleken met  \u20ac1000,- versturen van platform naar platform. )\n\n**- Bitvavo** ( Kosten:  \u20ac6,87 )\n\n**- FTX** ( Kosten:  \u20ac9,76 )\n\n**- Swissborg** ( Kosten:  \u20ac30,71 )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIk heb deels de cijfers gepakt van een onderzoek van [deze](https://www.meercrypto.nl/goedkoopste-crypto-platform) website, hun gaan ook nog wat dieper in op de inhoud & vergelijken meer platformen.\n\nToch zien we dat Bitvavo een van de goedkoopste exchanges is, persoonlijk vindt ik de interface van Bitvavo ook een goede voor beginners, ook heeft Bitvavo een Nederlandse klantenservice wat handig kan zijn, ook kan je betalen met iDeal wat ideaal is!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNatuurlijk is het ook goed om zelf onderzoek te doen, maar ik wou mijn persoonlijke mening graag laten horen voor de **beginners!**",

This is what I read in an article recently. I quote, \n\n*\"With a few tweaks of code, blockchain can be corrupted by authoritarians to build social credit enslavement systems. Matched with 5G, advances in surveillance technology, autonomous drones, facial recognition systems and artificial intelligence, blockchain can be used as the underlying infrastructure to crush privacy and freedom once and for all.*\n\n*If world governments legislate encryption technology for their own purposes and pervert consensus mechanisms for their own centralized enslavement systems, we will end up with digital currencies that can be used against the people of the world.\"*\n\nSo my question is if it this plausible and possible to happen? can blockchain be corrupted by authoritarians & governments as noted above?",

A bit like a database. Reddit has a database with all its content. Your bank has a database with all account information and history. Your government has a database with who knows what kind of information they want to store about you. And so forth.\n\nWhat sets a blockchain apart from those other forms of data storage is that a blockchain is decentralized. The database of your bank belongs to your bank and only they can decide who can see, add or modify data. With a blockchain, the database is hosted by its many users and anyone who follows the rules of the network can interact with it. A bank can decide to (or be forced to) lock you out of your account. There is no head office for a blockchain network where such a decision can be made (or imposed).\n\nIf a government would want to create some kind of dystopian mass surveillance state, it would be much simpler to do so with the centralized systems that are already in place rather than with a blockchain.",

They can't directly steal bitcoin you have in your wallet but just either double spend or perform a tx witholding attack. Users have multiple methods of retaliating and can reorg the chain to reverse any doublespends \n\n4)Bitcoin has a security mechanism within it that makes all Bitcoin collected from the block reward unspendable for 100 blocks giving time to identify an attack and take action before the attacking miners spend any of that bitcoin making any attacks extremely risky because they have to not only invest in many ASICs upfront but spend electricity before they can possibly collect a reward that can be taken away in a chain reorg \n\n5) There is an asymmetric advantage between the minority chain and a majority chain due to the Poisson process in Proof of work during a chain split war which means the attacker better have 80% or higher of the hashrate \n\n6) Miners tend to be very loyal to bitcoin because they have large sunk costs and would not want to damage their investments by reducing trust in Bitcoin \n\n7) Miners cannot change the existing protocol rules or remove any regardless how much hashrate they have because full nodes enforce the protocol rules (most are not controlled by miners) and any change will instant get vetoed by full nodes as an automatic immune reaction. \n\nMore information about the trending future of mining :\n\nMoores cliff means old ASICs do not become obsolete as quickly. ASICs are already down to 5nm , to put things in perspective Intels most expensive retail chips are still at 10nm , there really isn't that much more room for BTC ASICs to shrink which means decentralization of mining . There are also many fundamental misunderstandings people have towards the advantageous and disadvantageous in industrial mining.\n\nA few things you need to understand about mining \u2013\n\nChipmakers like TSMC and Samsung as 2 examples (Soon to add intel to this list) are the ones that are commissioned to make most ASIC chips(not the full assembled ASIC miner) based upon designs from Bitcoin ASIC manufactures. These foundries are involved in diverse chip making and obviously aren't directly involved in Bitcoin or its politics but fulfilling large orders from whoever commissions them.\n\nThe most popular ASIC manufacturers for Bitcoin right now are Whatsminer, Innosilicon, Bitmain, Caanan, Ebit, and Ebang. Many more ASIC manufacturers exist but they come and go based upon merit in a highly competitive race. For example Bitfury used to be one of the best manufacturers , and now has very little market share. Bitmain used to dominate , and than made some poor design decisions (lead engineer left them) and now competes with at least 4 others for the most efficient ASICs. This is a highly competitive and changing ecosystem.\n\nLarge miners main advantage is economies of scale over smaller miners. If you are an ASIC manufacturer you have large advantage over others because you can premine off your newest hardware and sell you last generation ASICs to others. This does occur , but is simplistic view and not the full picture. The reality is ASIC manufacturers Sell their newest ASICs with partners for industrial mining , sell their latest hardware to smaller miners for a premium, and mine themselves, while at the same time selling older ASICs on the market. Why do they do this? Because ASIC manufacturing is highly competitive and they need to hedge their investments as quickly as possible and de-risk from regulatory concerns as well.\n\nAmateur mining doesn't come with many risks of manufacturers who come and go (they are forced to make huge investments in ASIC orders and have long development pipelines fraught with risks)\n\nAmateur mining does not have the overhead of employees , security, regulatory compliance, building costs, tax liabilities , etc...\n\nNow here is what is interesting, this last generation of ASICs that went from 7nm to 5nm in size did not have the same efficiency jumps as previous drops. This is because 5nm is already at the edge of what can be done with silicone, we can possibly shrink down to 2-3nm but it gets extremely difficult as the gates start to get the size of a few atoms wide and quantum concerns and heat become a very big concern.\n\nWhy is any of this important?\n\nIn the past when ASICs went from 14nm to 12nm there was larger improvements in efficiencies which gave an advantage towards those who could manufacture and mine themselves and their partners. ASICs would become obsolete sooner 8 months to 1 year at times which makes it difficult for amateur miners to recoup their investment in an ASIC especially those that by the slightly older generation equipment.\n\nAs moore's cliff approaches (we are already there as I don't see 3-4nm anytime soon) this means that this latest generation of ASICs will have a much longer shelf life which means the variable above is much less important and the greater importance is a complex mix of what sort of electrical rates you can get - overhead costs.\nNow remember what I said about the advantageous of amateur mining. Industrial mining has other advantageous too like economies of scale and specialization but many disadvantageous as well.\n\nWhat this ultimately means is we are entering a period of commoditization in mining(the opposite of centralization). The economics force this direction. industrial miners will still exist but more and more amateur miners will enter the ecosystem. Eventually new companies will be also created that create products to recycle the waste heat (already exists , but prices will start to drop considerably for consumers)",

A 51% attack against the network would instantly destroy the trust in Bitcoin and crater the price, turning all that mining hardware into very expensive paperweights. Because unlike many altcoins that use multi-purpose GPUs, Bitcoin mining uses hardware that can only do one thing: mine Bitcoin.\n\nStill, to further reduce the risk, the protocol that mining pools use, Stratum, is being updated to a new version that offers better decentralization. Right now, the pool operator has full control over which transactions make it into a block. So even though mining pools get contributions from a large number of miners, only a small number of people can decide which transactions get mined.\n\nWith Stratum v2, the pool operator can only decide on what the coinbase transaction (the one that awards the block reward to the miner) looks like. Each participant in the pool can pick the rest of the transactions themselves (or outsource this choice to a trusted third party). So a pool operator using this protocol can no longer control which transactions get included.",

Bitcoin does not have \"turing complete\" scripting language natively but one must seriously question the wisdom of using a wide attack surface of a turing complete language on the protocol level. Keep in mind that Bitcoin can interact with clientside or serverside turing complete code and isolate that attack surface to the single application to remain secure and scalable.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the time people use the term \"smart contract\" is for marketing to the credulous without truly understanding the tradeoffs and limitations in security and scaling. One also has to consider that there is no censorship risk in code execution thus paying txs fees in a native token to execute code is extremely inefficient, unscalable, insecure, and pointless.\n\nThere is also no foreseeable risk of censorship in code execution because developers will not stand for microkernels that censor their code and it is easy to obscure ones code against these restrictions even if they exist. Thus why do we need to execute the same code across many nodes if the censorship risk does not exist and will not exist? What does exist is censorship risk in value transfer and why Bitcoin exists.\n\nBitcoin has a drivetrain like rootstock and simplicity language being developed for future smart contracts but one should also be skeptical about the utility of these projects as well due to the lack of utility in more complex \"contracts\" and the fact that many things in reality depend upon humans and laws that exist off the protocol thus needing TTP(trusted third parties) regardless.\n\nOf the two simplicity is more interesting project however because it not turing complete and it can use static analysis to determine the required costs or resources needed before execution of the script which is really interesting and secure.\n\nhttps://blockstream.com/simplicity.pdf\n\nHere is some more information on Smart contracts in Bitcoin-\n\nhttps://dev.lightning.community/lapps/\n\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Bitcoin-Lab-Berlin/events/250935489/\n\nHere is some more information on HTLC, lightning and scripting in bitcoin-\n\nhttps://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Hashed_Timelock_Contracts\n\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Lightning_Network\n\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hashed_Timelock_Contracts\n\nhttps://lnroute.com/\n\nhttps://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/00-introduction.md\n\nhttps://github.com/bcongdon/awesome-lightning-network/blob/master/readme.md",

                                    "response": "For the US, if you sell, trade for another asset, or spend it becomes a taxable event. One reason, of many, why day trading is a nightmare. \n**Yes, Every single trade on an exchange is a taxable event besides initially buying Bitcoin!**\nNow this has several implications. Day trading becomes tax nightmare because every transaction is a taxable event. So someone that daytrades or invests in altcoins may be forced to use specialized software or hire an accountant for thousands of dollars and someone that just makes an occasional purchase of Bitcoin and withdraws it has a much easier task of calculated any taxes especially if they don't make large purchases giving them an excuse to simply not report. Not the same if you are daytrading on exchanges , especially if you have made over 200 trades in a year.\n\nAlso there is a distinction between short term and long term capital gains taxes so its much wiser to not sell your BTC for at least 1 year so at worst you have to pay the much lower long term capital gains -\n\nLook at this chart -\n\nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2021-capital-gains-tax-rates-and-how-to-minimize-t/\nTL;DR - most people will need to pay 15% in the USA for selling BTC after a year.\n\n**Buy Bitcoin , record the price you bought it for and the date in a spreadsheet and wait at least 1 year before selling it or taking profits so if you do decide to pay taxes on profits you are at least in the lower tax category of long term capital gains.**\n\nMany people do not pay taxes when they spend BTC or sell it in person for cash but if you sell on any exchange like coinbase in the future , buy a car, boat, atv, house , land with Bitcoin , you better pay your taxes\n\nExamples - \n\n**Example 1 legal**: Say you bought 10 BTC for 1k USD each and want to sell them over a year later. Those BTC are now worth 10k each so you have a realized profit of 90k USD, thus your taxable income is now 90k if you have no other income. This would means you are in the 15% tax bracket thus are subject to 13,500 USD in taxes on the profit - deductions and writeoffs. So lets say with your writeoffs and deductions you now have to pay 6.5k in taxes , leaving you with 83,500 USD to put a down payment on a home.\n\n**Example 2 legal** - You have 10 BTC purchased or mined at 1k each when you received them. This is now worth 100k USD. You wait a year to sell them and never sell more than the amount where your total income exceeds 39,375 usd per year and than file your taxes where you pay none due to being in the first capital gains bracket **if you have no other sources of income as you state** . This will take several years or much longer(as btc continues to appreciate) to slowly sell off your bitcoin\n\n\n**Example 3 technically illegal**  - You have 10 BTC purchased or mined at 1k each when you received them. This is now worth 100k USD. You decide to use your reported income from your occupation to buy a home and keep the BTC spending separate on other items. You slowly spend your BTC on amazon, plane trips, hotels, selling small amounts in person or in atms without ID , restaurants in a private manner(personal wallet that you control private keys and you have done the minimum to wash the BTC). Technically you need to report taxes on every tx , but since you are not day trading the exchange you bought the BTC from does not report you and it is unenforceable for the IRS to even know you are spending those BTC. Since you are not buying large items registered to your identity you are also not targeted as well.\n\nHere are other ways people avoid taxes -\n\nspend btc directly for non registered items \u2013technically illegal if you don\u2019t pay taxes but difficult to enforce\n\nsell at 2 way atms without ID (coinatmradar.com) \u2013technically illegal if you don\u2019t pay taxes but difficult to enforce\n\n\nsell p2p with others\u2013technically illegal if you don\u2019t pay taxes but difficult to enforce\n\n\nsell on a DEX like BISQ\u2013technically illegal if you don\u2019t pay taxes but difficult to enforce\n\n\nSell the minimum in a country like the USA where you can get in the 0% long term cap gains rate - legal\n\nKeep the btc as collateral and take on debt that is not taxable - legal\n\nGift bitcoin with a gift tax exemption - legal\n\nDonate bitcoin to charities - legal\n\n\nFor countries like the USA you can use any accounting method as long as you are consistent\n\nIf you were to use FIFO(first in , first out) it would look like this\n\nBuy 1- 0.12 BTC @ 1000 USD\n\nBuy 2 - 0.5 BTC @ 3540 USD\n\nBuy 3 - 0.025 @ 4512 USD\n\nBuy 4 - 0.0054 @ 8004 USD\n\nSay you decide to sell 0.5 BTC for fiat(USD) when Bitcoin is valued at 40k usd\nThis would mean you would take your first in 2 purchases\n\n0.12x40k = 4,800 usd in value - 120 initial purchase price = 4680 in profit\n\n0.38 btc x 40k = 15,200 - original purchase rate of 0.38 (1345.2) = 13,854.2 profit\n\nTotal taxable profit = 18,534.8 usd\n\nIf its over a year , you are looking at the lower long term cap gains ... most people this would be 15% so you pay 2,780.22 usd in taxes if you decide to pay them\nIf under a year you will have the much higher ordinary tax rate (22-40% for most people)",

Up to now I've been buying my crypto bit by bit from Coinbase, but I don't like the idea of leaving it on their exchange in light of recent events, so in thinking I should move it to a cold wallet?\n\nWhat advice or tips do you have for me? Best cold wallet, exchanges, alt coins or resources to learn more about crypto in general would be greatly appreciated.",

                    "response": "Here is some general advice.\n\n1)\tDo you have high interest debt (5% and higher) and no savings?\n\nIf the answer is Yes - Do not invest in any Bitcoin. (you can use bitcoin to save money but don't speculate with it as an investment)\n\n2)\tDo you have any credit card debt and fiat savings?\n\nIf the answer is Yes ,than at minimum pay off all your credit card debt with fiat savings unless you are in debt to such a degree and plan on filing bankruptcy. Do not invest in Bitcoin until you have paid off all high interest debt\n\n3)\tHave a lot of low interest credit card debt (below 5%) and no fiat savings?\n\nYou should make a budget , cut expenses, and simultaneously start paying off your debt(unless you plan to file chapter 7 bankruptcy) , start saving a fiat emergency fund, and start buying Bitcoin.\n\n4)\tHave no debt and no fiat savings?\n\nYou should make a budget , cut expenses, start simultaneously saving for 6-12 months worth of living expenses in fiat emergency fund (only stable forms of fiat, obviously not the Argentinian peso or Venezuelan bolivar) and invest in Bitcoin, and seriously consider investing in stocks(preferable an index fund ETF like SPDR) or a IRA.\n\n5) You have a large amount of fiat savings and no debt and want to know if its best to dollar cost average invest or invest it all immediately?\n\nThe answer almost always is to make a plan and invest 100% of the fiat (not including your emergency fund) immediately in a diversified portfolio of investments that are non correlated (land, stocks, Bitcoin, businesses with positive cash flow) . It is often impossible to time the market and those that invest earlier will gain the most compound interest. The reason why dollar cost average investment is popular and a fine strategy is merely because most people don't have a large amount of fiat to invest upfront so invest a little each time they are paid.\n\nHere is a useful tool for you - https://dcabtc.com\n\nThus if you get paid twice a month than what you should do is buy some Bitcoin immediately twice a month and also in addition set buy limit orders on an exchange for 5-10% below spot price. If those orders do not get filled by  the following paycheck than buy your set amount and reset the buy limit orders for 5-10% below spot price from the current market price.\nThe reason for this is 2 fold:\n\n1)\tyou can auto pickup savings with BTC volatility on the dips which is psychologically rewarding\n\n2)\tIf a large amount of people create large amounts of Buy limit support than BTC becomes more stable unit of account and more liquid leading to more investor confidence and making BTC more of a currency(less volatility = better unit of account) and thus increases the likelihood your investment will continue appreciating in value.\n\n\nThe reason having a fiat savings account is so important is it not only will it save you if you lose a job or have an unexpected car expense or medical bill, but that it makes you a more rational investor that is less stressed out by the volatility in your more risky investments like Bitcoin. Bitcoin historically has had at least 2 bear markets lasting a little over 1 year thus you need to be prepared to not be forced to sell at a loss for at least 2 years to give yourself enough of a buffer.",

Exchanges get hacked. So don't leave your money sitting there. Use a hardware wallet.\n2. Use multiple exchanges. If you're on Coinbase, try another exchange Binance. \n3. Ledger and Trezor are good hardware wallets that I use personally. Have a look at some reviews and see which one is right for you.\n4. Don't FOMO into a coin because someone is trying to promote it. Ask yourself things like \"What problem does it solve? Are there other coins that do this already?\"\n5. If you don't need to sell, don't sell. The market will come back in time. \n6. Understand that some \"gurus\" / \"youtubers\" / \"podcasters\" are there to sell ads or get income from affiliate sales. Their advice should be taken with a grain of salt. Do your own research. \n7. The people who give you financial advice, but then say \"oh but that's not financial advice\" are not the people you should be listening to. \n8. See point 1. Exchanges get hacked. Don't leave you money there. \n9. Only spend what you can afford to lose. Ask yourself, \"If I lost all of this money today, would it affect me? Would I lose sleep over it? Would it negatively impact my life?\". If the answer is yes, then don't spend it !!!\n\nHope this gives you some things to think about.",

No real world info was required. You just made an account. Unfortunately, I believe this was in 2015-17, and I have COMPLETELY forgotten what the site was, whether it turned into a scam later, disappeared etc.  \n\nI've avoided the big mainstream Coinbase because I don't want to do a lot of trading, just do this specific procedure every few years, and it's apparently a bureaucratic nightmare with terrible customer service, and has been hacked a lot due to bad security practices.\n\nSo what's the best alternative that makes the compromises I want and is relatively light?\n\n\\*Phone number is good for 2F security, so that piece of real world is fine, but I mean that I don't want it linked to my bank account or to require ID.",

I've found Blockchain's support to be absolutely horrible. I filed a ticket with their support and didn't get a reply for 4 months and they acted like there was no problem with that.

Or is only if you are holding it as an asset and cash out that it becomes an issue? I've also lost money on it from being ripped off by scammers, but I'm guessing the IRS wouldn't care about that, they just care about the transferring of it?\n\nSo, any tips, advice, suggestions, or help would be greatly appreciated.

Only if I want to spend/send BTC out, would I need to actually reconnect my device to complete this by signing the transactions  \n\nSo, what I want to know is can I one-time connect the wallet and device, and keep receiving to the hot Wallet *without reconnecting my HW device*, and only have reconnect the device to then send?\n\nThank you!",

Later on, I was talking to some friends and the suggested a couple other exchanges. So I'm thinking, yeah, I should check out these other exchanges. So I sold my BTC and I cannot put the money back into my account. I called helpdesk and they said, \"oh it's on hold. you wont be able to access it until the 16th\". I was like WTF?? I am on hold right now because I blew a gasket and told him to find someone to remove that hold.\n\nHe gives me this dumb reason, \"oh its on hold for safety reasons...blah, blah, blah\". I asked him, \"ok, then tell me how my money is safer on the 16th, than it is today?? That makes no sense at all.\"\n\nHas anyone experienced this with Coinbase?? Or heard of them doing this??",

New users can wait 7-14 days , older users a week. The way around this is using a debit card but fees are higher, or making a wire transfer but for many banks this is not free\n\n>ok, then tell me how my money is safer on the 16th, than it is today?? That makes no sense at all.\"\n\nACH bank transfers can bounce and fiat being sent electronically in general lacks transaction finality unlike Bitcoin which you can trust after 1 confirmation . Thus you are giving coinbase insecure money that might be returned for secure money(bitcoin) that if you withdraw you can take and cannot be returned if your fiat bounces",

If someone gives you a bank transfer , paypal transfer , or a check that you cash it will often **initially** show its approved and than can bounce later , sometimes months later\n\n**Electronic Fiat lacks transaction finality**\n\nThis is the same with your debit card as well , but debit cards rely more on fraud protection and insurance of your bank taking a little risk off of the bitcoin exchange which is why they allow immediate withdrawals. They can still be cheated by you even if you use a debit card. Bitcoin is much more secure than fiat in this respect\n\n>That other guy made it sound like \"maybe\" there is a chance I would ever see my money again.\n\nYou shouldn't worry , coinbase is a publicly traded company that is highly regulated.",

You have just lost a bunch of money. I am not saying this will happen. I am saying it is a possibility. \n\nThis is why DCA (regularly buying a set amount every so often) is recommended. It averages things out making it less likely to make a large bad trade.\n\nThe only thing for certain is the price will go up or down. Only invest money you can stand to lose.",

Don't use an exchange or a centralised service, those are much easier to block than the Bitcoin network.\n\nA hardware wallet is a device that keeps track of your bitcoin and allows you to spend it. If you can't get to a hardware wallet, you can install a software wallet on a smart phone. It's less safe than a hardware wallet, easier to hack, but sounds like you can't be picky in your situation. If possible, resetting the phone to factory settings and installing something like Malwarebytes can help. Scan the phone to make sure it's clear of malware, then create and use the Bitcoin wallet. Maybe test with a smaller amount first to see if it goes through and isn't stolen. A Bitcoin transfer takes 10-20 minutes, usually.\n\nIf they can't exchange on their end see if there are any peer-to-peer services available around them.\n\nHope that helps. War is awful.",

What you can use will depend on where you live.

I was utterly shocked to find out that a $400 transfer through Western Union was cancelled even though it complete and ready to pay out in less than 12 hours",

My big worry is that I don't know whether or not the app gives me a new QR code everytime I click export, or if its the same code always.\nActually to be more clear, my big worry is: will this qr code still work even years down the line, or is there a chance of it becoming invalid?",

Then if you lose your device, you can add it back to your authenticator app. I have done this with BitWarden.\n\nBut it is also possible to bypass the 2FA. For websites like Google, they may just have you use a backup method such as follow a link in an email they sent, or send you a SMS with a code - if you have those things already set up. For this reason my advice is to consider all methods in which someone could compromise your account before they go ahead and do it. Some websites will hand you backup codes, which you can use as one-time access codes to get in and fix things if you lose access.",

But the operations that use the unused or lost electricty, I think that is beneficial.  The operators of the mines just have  to think how there mine is effecting the environment and take proper action over profit.  But who likes to lose money?",

Humans instead of ASICs are shouldering more of the work to create, regulate , and secure each of those currencies; This is \"work\" whether it involves burning electricity directly or food and electricity that humans consume  to perform their work.

How do you fund the purchases (bank transfer or credit card have very different fees)? And ultimately a critical factor is the country you live in.\n\nNote that none of this relates in any way to Trezor. The wallet you use doesn't affect which exchange is best for you.",

A lot of the major exchanges like Kraken Pro, CDC, Binance, Coinbase Pro all have relatively similar fees if you are a lower volume trader. If you are higher volume it makes more sense to pay attention to those fees. Any one you pick, which isn't just limited to the list above, all have the ability to withdraw to a hardware wallet like Trezor. Keep in mind, you also need to factor in deposit and withdrawal fees to look at the overall picture of how much an exchange is actually costing you.",

They\u2019re purpose built mini computers designed to handle private keys and sign transactions. \n\nIt\u2019s a strange concept, but Bitcoins are not stored like files. They\u2019re entries in the public database called the \u201cblockchain\u201d. Wallet store digital *keys* to bitcoin. \n\nHardware wallets generate keys on the device and use the keys to generate receiving addresses and to digitally sign outgoing transactions. The keys *do not leave the device*, even when the device is connected to a computer. \n\nIf you set up a software wallet (such as Electrum) on your computer, then the keys exist in your computer\u2019s memory where they are potentially vulnerable to malicious software.\n\nIn addition, modern wallets (both hardware and software) derive keys from a master \u201crecovery seed\u201d which is randomly generated during setup and you are instructed to write down and store as a backup. If you\u2019re planning to hold for a long time then ultimately all you need to keep safe is this recovery seed. \n\nIf you enter a wallet\u2019s recovery seed into a computer, it\u2019s accessible by key loggers. If you store your wallet\u2019s recovery seed in a file then it\u2019s vulnerable.\n\nThe hardware wallet subreddits have plenty of examples of people losing their funds because they stored their seed electronically and it got stolen. \n\nThe safest method for storage is to use a hardware wallet (or dedicated offline computer if you have the technical knowledge) and to store your recovery seed offline on paper or stamped into metal plates. This ensures the seed was never exposed to hackers and cannot be stolen remotely. You can add additional protection to the written seed with a \u201cpassphrase\u201d, which you could memorise (not recommended) or store separately.",

Trezor's hardware and firmware is also 100% open source and peer reviewed and audited by many professionals \n\n> I actually don't know what the word open source means but I mean is the wallet software program/code open to be inspected by the public?\n\nThere are many open source licenses that all have different properties but in context when someone refers to a wallet in Bitcoin as open source they mean the source code for the wallet is readable by anyone to contribute towards and peer review \n\n 3 different ways to classify wallets\n\n**Custodial vs Non Custodial**\n\n**Custodial wallets** = Most exchanges and web wallets . You do not own any Bitcoin but \"IOUs\". (legally you own the bitcoin but practically you don't as the law will not help you in most cases and can and often will be used against you) You have little privacy and your bitcoin is in control of someone else that has their own private keys/seeds which you do not have that reserve your Bitcoin. The bitcoin you own might not exist or may be fractional as well diluting the supply of Bitcoin and decreasing the ability of your investment to appreciate in value. Keeping bitcoin in exchanges also makes Bitcoin more insecure as a whole from attacks and theft. \n\n**Non - Custodial wallets**\n\nYou have the Bitcoin in your private wallet and no one knows your privatekey/seed backup but you. You actually own your own Bitcoin. \n\n------------------------------------------\n**Hot wallets vs Warm Wallets vs Cold wallets**\n\n**Hot wallet** - wallet connected to the internet. \n\nExamples - mobile wallets , web wallets , wallets in exchanges, desktop wallets  \n\n**Warm wallet** - wallet indirectly connected to the internet but a piece of hardware tries to isolate the private keys and transaction signing \n\nExamples - hardware wallets. wallets like cold card with PSBTs offer slightly better security than other HW wallets when used correctly  \n\n**cold wallet** - wallet not connected to the internet \n\nExamples - paper wallets(all new paper wallets should use 12-24 seed words instead of private keys), offline laptop that never connects to the internet with a wallet, , hardware wallets not connected to the internet\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Closed source vs Open source**\n\n**Closed source wallets** - Code for your wallet is not publicly available and auditable by third parties. This allows backdoors and exploits that internal employees or external attackers can exploit and really undermines the security and ideals of decentralization as you must have faith in the company or wallet developers.\n\nWhy use cryptocurrency at all if you have to have faith in a single company or developer?\n\n**Open source wallets** - wallets that allow the source code to be independently audited and peer reviewed and freedom to continue developing the wallet even if the original developers disappear. While not immune from software bugs and exploits (as all code is vulnerable to) open source code gives better transparency and security. You might not be able to understand and audit the code but many other can and will and be able to warn you if a backdoor or exploit exists.\n\nhttps://walletscrutiny.com/",

It\u2019s clearly not as good as direct investment but if a user wanted ease of investment through their traditional brokerage and only cared about capital appreciation then this wouldn\u2019t matter. Most people will only care about capital appreciation in a mass adoption scenario despite the \u201cdefi\u201d uses of BTC.

Unlike an actual coin, not only do you not have custody but you are also entirely reliant on the actions of these 3rd party custodians to keep said Bitcoin. The idea of assuming a software company's value is pegged to an asset that they are under no obligation to hold is also more than a stretch.",

With that in mind over a certain time frame (like 3, 5 , 8 years or whatever your timeframe is) you would enjoy most of the gains from BTC. \n\nI\u2019d say the 3rd party Rick of GBTC and MSTR are relatively low risk over that timeframe. Both are publicly traded, if they failed in that time there is a good chance a large unforeseen global event has occurred effecting everything in which we\u2019re all wrong. At least from a probability perspective. \n\nFrom the same vain of holding BTC exchange risk is similar meaning the only safe way to hold BTC is self custody. Ignoring the fact that self custody is not a good idea for everyone as so many will not be suited to do so successfully would be irresponsible. Thus proxies have more value than they are given creedance until ease of investment and custody is addressed for everyone. Those in these threads tend to be more advanced than most but want mass adoption not just Reddit users. Just good for thought on the use of proxies in the near term 1-8 years while this addressed (I have no idea how long that will take to change thus the range).",

It is a protocol, so a set of rules that govern the interactions between participants and a network of users that follow this protocol.\n\nThere are different software applications that implement the rules of the Bitcoin protocol and that can interact with the Bitcoin network. The most well known one is Bitcoin Core, which is direct descendant of the original application developed by Satoshi. However, anyone can develop their own software to interact with the network. And plenty of people have.\n\nThe key players in the network are the so-called \"nodes\". These nodes run software that keeps a full record of all transactions and is able to share that with other nodes. When someone sends a transaction, it is broadcast to all nodes that person is connected to, who will check to see if it's OK and then send it onward to nodes that they are in turn connected to. This process repeats itself until the entire network has received this transaction.\n\nThere's a problem here though. What if someone sends 2 different, but conflicting transactions. For example a transaction where I send my coins to a merchant and another where I send the same coins to an address controlled by myself. Nodes will check transactions and drop any that clash with previously received transactions, but since it takes time for transactions to make it across the network, it's possible that some nodes will receive one version first, where others will receive another version first.\n\nThere is a need to pick a winner and to \"finalize\" a transaction. And that's where miners come in. The Bitcoin protocol specifies that transactions are to be gathered in a data structure called a \"block\". Each block contains a bunch of transactions and some header data, including a reference to the previous block, making the blocks form a chain linking from the most recent one all the way back to the first block. Hence: blockchain.\n\nA transaction is not considered final unless it's been included in a block. In order to ensure that blocks don't get created by anyone every second, a special requirement was put in place: Each block has some free space where the miner can put in whatever data they want. Once a miner has assembled a block, the block (or more specifically: its header) needs to be run through a specific mathematical function, which for all intents and purposes spits out a large, random number (Yes, I know it's not actually random, but it's close enough in this case). Only if this number is smaller than a certain target value, will the block be considered valid. If it's not, the miner can change the data in the free space of the block and try again.\n\nThis repeated process of filling in some data in the free space and computing the number (the so-called \"hash of the block header\") is what the mining process is all about. Once someone finds a value that works, they'll submit their completed block to the rest of the network (who can very easily verify that it is correct) and the network moves on to the next block. The faster your mining hardware is, the more of these guesses you can do per second and the better your chances are to be the first to find the right value. So miners with more and better hardware, end up creating more blocks.\n\nAnd that's where we come to the \"why bother\" part of mining: Money.\n\nAll of the transactions included in the block need to be valid transactions that each have at least as much money on the \"From:\" side as they have on the \"To:\" side. Except for one. The protocol allows for a single transaction in each block to assign bitcoins to an address without there being a source. This special transaction is called the \"coinbase transaction\".  Since the miner creates the block, the miner gets to decide who the lucky recipient is of this coinbase transaction (hint: it's themself).\n\nThe size of the coinbase transaction is also restricted by the rules of the network. It consists of 2 components: First there is the block reward, which is an amount of Bitcoin that is essentially \"newly minted\". The block reward is currently 6.25 BTC per block, but it is halved approximately every 4 years. On top of the block reward, the coinbase transaction may also award all the transaction fees of the other transactions in a block. So miners are incentivized to include as many fee-paying transactions in a block as possible (up to the limit of available transactions or the maximum size of a block).\n\n> 8) when does a miner get paid? I'm assuming the first person whose computer completes the verification of a transaction is the one who gets paid, and it's not a shared effort kind of thing.\n\nMany miners do not operate alone, because the chances of finding a block in a highly competitive environment are very low and a solo miner might have to mine for many years before having a chance of hitting the jackpot. So many miners collaborate in mining pools, that together act as a single entity. The mining pool will claim all the coinbase transactions, but then split the rewards among the participating miners, with each getting a payout proportional to the amount of mining power they contributed.",

                    "response": "Somehow, you're reading stuff and watching videos which do not understand that Bitcoin nodes are separate from Bitcoin miners. This common error tends to over-emphasize the importance of miners, confusing the how, what and why  \n\n> Bitcoin is an app\n\nSeriously, this is meaningless, shallow. All useful computer software is an app. That fact is useless for discovering the system's purpose and its design  \n\nA few years ago, most people would read the small Satoshi white paper first  \nhttps://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf  \nNow, it seems most people are unaware of it  \n\nBitcoin is a payment system. It was designed for a specific purpose - to allow merchants and customers to transact on-line without using centralized payment services (Visa, PayPal, others). The centralized services have adopted the role of gatekeeper. They decide who can participate, and which transactions are allowed or banned  \n\nTo avoid falling into the gatekeeper trap, Bitcoin is decentralized. Around the world, about 50,000 Bitcoin nodes are operated by volunteers. Each node operates independently, keeping its own copy of the Bitcoin transaction history (blockchain), checking every new block and all the transactions in each new block. There is no controller, no manager, no boss  \n\nAs a networked system, with nodes all over the world, Bitcoin processing has built-in delays. To ensure that every independently-operated node stores the same transaction history, transactions are grouped into blocks, and blocks are released to the network every 10 minutes (average). The 10-minute delay is essential for all nodes to stay synchronized  \n\nBecause it is decentralized, with no controller, the network does not have a real-time clock  \n\nMining is subordinate to the consensus verification performed by the node network  \n\nMiners provide a service to the network by creating the delay between blocks. Miners participate in a guessing competition which has been designed so that it takes about 10 minutes to find the answer  \n\nThe miners' guessing competition requires a lot of work. The work is stored inside each block. A block can not be replaced unless there is a network of miners with enough computing power to repeat the work. Every block is linked to the previous block. This means that replacing an old block requires repeating the work for that block and all its successors  \n\nThe Bitcoin process has multiple steps  \n\n*    unconfirmed transactions are received by nodes. Every node propagates the transactions to its neighbors. As a matter of policy, most nodes check the validity of transactions during propagation  \n\n*    each miner gathers a collection of unconfirmed transactions into a block, performs some calculations with the block, participates in the guessing competition. After about 10 minutes, one miner wins the competition by having a block which has a header which has a hash which has a value smaller than the current mining target. The winning miner submits his block to his neighbor nodes  \n\n*    nodes do not trust miners. Each node checks that the block received from the miner is a valid block, and contains only valid transactions. If any error is discovered, processing stops. If the block is valid, it is added to the node's blockchain, and then propagated to the node's neighbors. Nodes do not trust nodes. Every node repeats the validation work. If the block it not valid, it is not propagated to any more nodes  \n\nFor the first 6930000 blocks (about 132 years), Bitcoin needs to issue new coins. In the multi-step Bitcoin process (above), there is one choke point. One miner wins a race to add one block to the nodes' blockchains. As a choke point, this is the best place to create the new coins. Strictly speaking, miners are not \"paid\" or \"rewarded\" for mining. The winning miner creates a transaction with a newly issued coin, and pays the coin to any valid address. This transaction is called \"coinbase\". It is always the first transaction in every block. In the early days, the miner would pay the coinbase coin to his own address. Since the beginning of the mining pool days, a miner pays his mining pool manager's address\n\n> They lend the computing power of their computers to \"solve complex math problems\"\n\nThe guessing competition uses the SHA2 algorithm. It is not complex. Mining is not complex. It is hard, because it requires about 120 sextillion guesses for  about 2 million miners to discover a winning block in about 10 minutes. Hard does not mean complex\n\n> people who do this (lending computing power to verify transactions) are called miners\n\nThis is not correct. Miners participate in the guessing competition. Transaction verification is the role of the node network. All the nodes in the node network verify that the winning miner's block is valid. The miners' main role is to create a 10-minute delay between blocks  \n\nIn a multi-step process, the validity of the data can only be proven in the final step. Mining is not the final step. Nodes do not trust miners  \n\nMining is subordinate to the consensus verification performed by the node network\n\n> who exactly pays the miners?\n\nThere is no \"who\". Bitcoin is an automated networked software system  \n\nWhen a miner builds a candidate block before beginning mining, he also fabricates the block's first transaction, the coinbase transaction. This transaction creates the new coin. The coin is paid to the address in the transaction\n\n> when does a miner get paid?\n\nThe coinbase payment is valid if the block is valid. The payment is added to the nodes' blockchains as its block propagates around the node network. One of the consensus rules prevents the coinbase coin from being spent until it is 100 blocks old\n\n> I'm assuming the first person whose computer completes the verification of a transaction is the one who gets paid, and it's not a shared effort kind of thing\n\nThe \"person\" does not get paid. The coinbase transaction becomes part of Bitcoin's transaction history because its block is added to the blockchains of the nodes  \n\nTechnically, the address of the coinbase transaction can be any valid address. A miner might choose to pay his wife's stockbroker  \n\nIn practice, there are 2 million miners competing to mine about 52,000 blocks per year. To get paid anything, miners organized into mining pools. A miner puts his mining pool's address into the coinbase transaction of his block. Bitcoin mining is not a \"shared effort kind of thing\" by design. It is a shared effort with a fair payment distribution by miners' choice. The pools distribute their payments to their members in proportion to the work they contribute to each block",

And even if a couple people show up and start trading their false bitcoin back and forth, if one of those people needs to sell all their false-bitcoin the others will realize they actually aren\u2019t willing to pay real dollars or real BTC for the false bitcoin being sold.

I\u2019m wondering if there are any implications to this, tax related or otherwise.\n\nIs this something I have to report to the IRS ( fwiw, I expect the overall move to be a net loss as surely some money will be deducted in fees etc, and he won\u2019t receive exactly what i on-ramp). The dollar amount is more than $15k (which I believe is considered the cap on sending crypto \u201cgifts\u201d), so technically it can\u2019t be considered a gift either\u2026\n\nI appreciate any help and advice! Thank you in advance.\n\nEdit: there\u2019s no trust issues at all. This is someone I know at a personal level and I\u2019ve just generalized them as a \u201cfriend\u201d for easier reference.",
