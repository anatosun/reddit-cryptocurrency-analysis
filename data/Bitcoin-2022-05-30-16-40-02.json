Miners go along for the ride.\n\nSpeedy trial was a mining activated soft fork that coordinated the miners to activate taproot (or recognize taproot transactions as valid) at a certain block height. This coordination is done so miners are all on the same page and there is not a minority chain split mistakenly. \n\nThe consequence of a miner not being on the main chain is that they could mine on top of an old block, when a new valid block (with now valid taproot transactions) has already been found that they should have been mining on top of. \n\nThe ultimate consequence of this to the miner is they would miss out on a reward mining on an old already solved block.\n\nThe ultimate consequence for the network could be a minority fork or longer chain reorgs than normal, not ideal, but manageable.\n\nThus this upgrade process was not really a vote. it was a coordination event to ensure smooth activation. \n\nConsensus for that activation was achieved through a long process (years) of developer review & community awareness (ie end user node runners). This consensus process was the real \"voting\" mechanism of the upgrade process.\n\nThe MASF speedy trial proposal was submitted by node runners, community members and developers to the miners as a subtle non contentious push. \n\nMiners were given a nice pre-ultimatum. The message was, we have community consensus on taproot, activate taproot by this height volentarily or maybe we'll come back with a more forceful activation proposal...like a user activated soft fork enforced by node runners (uasf).\n\nThus the miners did not have a final say in this vote, they simply ratified the vote already approved by the community and the community could have ratified itself had the miners not ratified it on their own.\n\nit's a bit of a dance. But ultimately the sovereignty lies in the nodes. The miners are along for the ride, though serve an important function, though it's often exaggerated over nodes. Which is not technically correct.",

We just create (well the central banks create) more and more money which makes every dollar and euro become worth less and less, thus the price of items grow.",

It's just different units for expressing the same value.\n\nBut if someone decides that suddenly we have to have more slices (print more money), and they've not changed the size of the economic pie (total value of products and services), my slice has to be smaller to accomodate the change. It's less value for the same unit of money now. My slice of the pie is suddenly only a half of a slice, even though I've earned a whole slice fair and square - and I do care about that, because that's theft and now I'm hungry and angry, and if I'm hungry enough, I may start a conflict or a revolution over it, and those tend to be unpleasant.",
