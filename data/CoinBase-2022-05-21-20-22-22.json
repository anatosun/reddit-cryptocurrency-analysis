            "selftext": "I recently purchased a Ledger Nano X to move my crypto to cold storage. I made a test transaction of $10 with no issues to my Nano Ledger and back. When I attempted to withdraw the full amount of 50k XRP I forgot to copy my Ledger address and pasted my Coinbase address from the previous transaction. Since Ledger does not have a tag I used \u201c1234\u201d. This worked the first time as I was sending to Ledger. Now my 50K XRP worth $20,000+ is gone. This is a simple issue to fix as the XRP was sent to Coinbase\u2019s XRP address and not the wallet of another customer or exchange. Coinbase would not have to \u201ctake\u201d the XRP from another customer. All they need to do is match my transaction to the transaction in their wallet to return my funds. I don\u2019t see how a company hoping to go public can possibly condone stealing a customers money. I\u2019ve been a loyal customer and hope to stay that way. I just want the basic decency of correcting an easily fixed problem. Case#11914895",

There is literally a time stamp of the transaction  time with the exact amount of XRP leaving my wallet and entering Coinbase\u2019s wallet. Pretty obvious where it came from. Not magic.

The \u201caddress\u201d is like a physical address. This example being Coinbase. The \u201ctag\u201d is the equivalent of the apartment number. Since Ledger doesn\u2019t have a tag number since it\u2019s an individual wallet my transaction doesn\u2019t have a valid one. By default it goes to Coinbase\u2019s wallet.

I sent it FROM Coinbase to the exact same Coinbase address -tag (because the cold wallet doesn\u2019t require a tag) I\u2019m not \u201caccepting\u201d an easily reversed $20k loss. All Coinbase XRP wallets have the same address. The tag is what differentiates the wallets. XRP tags are 9 digits. Since the tag I entered is not 9 digits it is sitting in Coinbases own wallet. The idea that not returning it isn\u2019t theft is ludicrous. It would be like a clerical error placing $20,000 in your own private checking account, you going to the bank and withdrawing it, then refusing to give it back because the bank should \u201caccept responsibility\u201d. How about holding companies customer service accountable??",
