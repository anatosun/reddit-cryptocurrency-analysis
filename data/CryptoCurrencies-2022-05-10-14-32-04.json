The problem lies within Ethereum itself and that problem should be solved asap if we ever dream of going mainstream.\n\nHowever, in the meantime, if we focus on scaling NFT especially, we\u2019ll start seeing drastic dips in gas fees.\n\nWe already have platforms like Polygon and we\u2019re also seeing new comers like Unique network offer lightning fast transactions with near zero fees.\n\nAnd what we need now is to see more and more similar projects start surfacing and developing asap.\n\nThe more we put control over NFT related gas fees, the more we\u2019ll be able to control gas fees overall and we\u2019ll start seeing way more activity and money being put into the market since users will now be more inclined towards doing more transactions.",
