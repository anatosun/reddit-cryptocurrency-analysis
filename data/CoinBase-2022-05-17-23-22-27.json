            "selftext": "When buying BTC one must wait 7 days for the ACH to clear before they can send those BTC off site. In this time the BTC value no doubt wildly fluctuates from what the fiat value was initially - this is what largely puts me off continuing to use Coinbase. \n\nAt the time of writing I'm down ~$42 from the first time I used it (months ago), which was originally off ~$2 from the amount needed for a necessary transaction. I figured I'd just wait for it to go back up. It's pretty consistently had a downward trend since, especially recently.\n\nHowever I had a thought and I wonder if I transferred USD directly into my Coinbase wallet, wait the 7 days for it to clear, could I then exchange that for BTC and have that BTC instantly available to send off site without the risk of volatility?\n\nCause at the end of the day the issue isn't waiting 7 days for ACH to clear. It's inherent volatility and the value potentially wildly changing within those 7 days. But if that could be bypassed...",
