If you have 30k to drop on a bitcoin but have never gone on a nice overseas vacation..just buy 2/3 of a bitcoin.

Your goals are separate and money/things are what should help you achieve your goals.

If you love to travel, exorbitant holidays might be what you're saving for. \n\nIf your goal is to have X amount of money, what will you do once you get there?",
