So I\u2019m surprised this still hasn\u2019t caught on, because in the few examples it was tried, it was greatly successful. Binance has been in the works on this for a while now, as they have already given the world Binance Pay that has almost replaced credit cards in many instances. And they could just about do the latter idea. \nThe problem is that people are too scared to leave their own ideals. We\u2019re just so used to paying with Apple Pay and buying off Amazon, that using cryptocurrency alternatives scares us, but here\u2019s why it shouldn\u2019t: it works just as well, if not better. \nCryptocurrency payments are a great idea. This has not been said enough. In every instant they were tried, they saw mass success, and great advantages over traditional ways: like speed, fees and a better experience. \nThe world will see this type of commerce soon, so why not head into it now? Now is a great time to do it, and I\u2019m sure Binance could make something that could be as powerful as the examples mentioned above. So before Binance\u2019s version comes, I\u2019ll stick to exeno for now.",

But I don't believe that ppl will be sending directly from crypto wallets as for the majority it's too complex (ppl can bearly use their online banking app).   \n\n\nI think Binance is great but focused on too many things at once. We need payments apps like Venmo, cash app which is integrated with most businesses and is crypto-based. Only then my grandmother can start using crypto as a payment method.",

When an entity acquires more than 5% of a company\u2019s equity shares. In response to the announcement, binance CEO changpeng Zhao tweeted, \u201cA small contribution to the cause\u201d, implying that he believes in the changes Musk wants to make to Twitter. Binance also made a $200million strategic investment in Forbes earlier this year, so this isn\u2019t the first time it\u2019s taken a stake in a media company.\n\nElon Musk has agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share.
