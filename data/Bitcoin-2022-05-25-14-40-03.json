                    "response": "You can keep the phone eternally offline by using either Electrum or BlueWallet. Here's my copypasta for that, just substitute \"offline Laptop\" for your smartphone.\n\nOne other thing: To install Electrum, I would either transfer it via a USB-thumb drive (with an adaptor for micro usb or usb-c), a micro-sd-card (if your old phone has such a connector), or make a wifi-hotspot with a unique name and password to once install Electrum. Then go into airplane mode and make the phone forget that hotspot and also delete the hotspot settings, so you don't accidentally turn it on again. Now the phone shouldn't have any knowledge of any wifi networks whatsoever it could accidentally use.\n\nAnd you can encrypt the local Electrum (or BlueWallet) installation on the phone.\n\nNote: Install Electrum ONLY from https://electrum.ORG or, if you use F-Droid or Google Play Store, make doubly sure it's the correct publisher for Electrum. Getting people to install counterfeit Electrum-malware is a very common attack against Bitcoin users. Anyway, here's the copypasta. Watch the videos to get an idea how an eternally offline computer would sign transactions:\n\nYou can either buy an off-the-shelf, cheap laptop or use your existing hardware to achieve cold storage.\n\nDownload Tails (https://tails.boum.org/) and run it from a DVD or USB-drive.\n\nRefrain from connecting to any network.\n\nCreate an Electrum wallet. Make two seed backups (paper, metal, brain,...), because Tails is an amnesiac system, meaning it will forget all settings, including your seed, upon reboot.\n\nHere are old but very explanatory videos of how cold storage with Electrum works:\n\n* Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9K3CozQpzM\n* Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK4JmfMCDBg (redundant, because Tails exists)\n* Part 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBVyFRb6ZZc\n\nTip: If you're using an Android device (a $50 tablet is enough) as your online-connected watch-only device, you can very handily transport unsigned and signed transactions between the laptop and the Android device using QR-codes.\n\n**ATTENTION:** The only legitimate source from which Electrum can be obtained is https://electrum.org. By using the Electrum installation that comes with Tails (https://tails.boum.org is the only legitimate place to obtain Tails from), you're introducing one possibly weak link into your setup. Same goes for downloading the Electrum app on Android. While the Google Play Store might be relatively secure, as is Tails, relatively secure, you do introduce another point of failure and trust. Learn how to download, verify and use the official Electrum releases from https://electrum.org. You can see Thomas Voegtlin's (the lead developer of Electrum) GPG-fingerprint in this video, where he is giving a lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjYCXOyDy7Y. Here is a reproduction of that fingerprint:\n\n`6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6`",

The point for example is that BTC has gone down like 50% over the last few months while energy stocks went up. \n\nThat means that if you had energy stocks rather than fiat, you would be able to buy more BTC with your savings now. \n\nOr for example, some stocks benefit from recession such as discount grocery shops etcetera. If you hold those and a recession hits, then you preserve wealth throughout a bear market and you are able to afford to borrow, invest, spend etc just as much without being stuck waiting for the market to get better, which can even take a decade such as in 2001-2011. \n\nThe point of diversification overall is to stay afloat regardless of whatever the market is doing.\n\nOverall if you have a large stack of wealth, by being diversified you get to be wealthy in all markets conditions rather than being left hoping the market goes your way.",

Oil is truly remarkable because it\u2019s incredibly dense, from a little bit of it you get an absurd amount of energy, 24/7. \n\nLook up [this research](https://www.drexel.edu/~/media/Files/greatworks/pdf_sum10/WK8_Layton_EnergyDensities.ashx): oil is much more energy dense than all else (except nuclear)  \n\nThat is why people like Joe Biden, who agree with your spirit on clean energy, came into office announcing \u201cthe \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d but as soon as the price of oil went up, suddenly he\u2019s very grateful he\u2019s got his Strategic oil Reserves and is desperate to lower the oil price. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, the only real candidate to displace Oil in 2022 is Nuclear. But that will take a long time. Renewables will take a few decades, *at least*. \n\nTo make this very clear to you: given the lower energy density of renewable today compared to oil, it is impossible to switch away from oil completely right now unless you are willing to accept a drastically reduced standard of living. \n\nIn the meantime, the reality is this: you are stuck with oil. So either:\n\n- stop using electricity, modern conveniences and transportation or;\n\n- stop being hypocritical and judging morally a company for providing you with something that you need and ask for.",

There is a lot of manipulation governments can do against it to make it difficult to utilize the value proposition.\n\nYou may not want to be at a 100% concentration if a scenario like that plays out.  In my opinion, I see BTC just as you do.  However, I don\u2019t think the legacy dollar system is going to fail anytime soon and I also have confidence in a company like Tesla to increase in value.  So to hedge against the reality of BTC failing or being manipulated, I think a company like Tesla is another solid place to take a risk on.\n\nThere are no sure bets in monetary systems at this time.",

Lots of rich people have borrowed against their inflated stock portfolios to buy other assets like Florida vacation homes. These assets valuation grow faster than the compounding interest of the collaterized loans so it\u2019s basically free as long as the government keeps devaluing the currency. Problem is this system isn\u2019t sustainable and once the dominoes fall the risk cascades and affects everyone because it\u2019s all tethered together with no buffer. Savings accounts would be the buffer here, but who is stupid enough to keep large sums of cash to add collateral to these loans rather than be forced to sell. Bitcoin is the only viable solution, but most haven\u2019t realized it yet. I\u2019d say diversify a little when Bitcoin is \u201cThe Standard\u201d and is worth millions in USD.

They will tell you that you are the underdog fighting the evil corpos and turn off the part of your brain that's supposed to be thinking logically.\n\nDon't just invest in BTC because you think that corporations and governments are evil. Try to understand why BTC is a superior asset based on the property it has, and how it fits into the rest of the world without using a good/evil dichotomy. Good luck.",

Michael saylor actually mentioned something in one of his interviews where he said when people rebalance their portfolio a lot of the time they will sell the winners to buy more losers to balance their risk. With that perspective, it doesn\u2019t make sense to hold anything other than Bitcoin since it is the obvious winner. \n\n2. The reason why you diversify is because Bitcoin has extremely high volatility and a lot of people can\u2019t swallow daily 5%+ swings and sometimes there are even bigger swings like double digit swings. Because of the extremely high volatility you would diversify into some stocks that would be negatively correlated to Bitcoin to balance out the swings. This is mostly for people that aren\u2019t able to swallow the volatility and they just need a steady growing investment over the years. \n\nWith those two points in mind you would have to figure out for yourself if it makes sense to diversify. I am heavily invested in crypto but a lot of these tech stocks are looking really nice rn and I might throw some money in there as well.",

If you have $200, then $100 is a *lot,* and it's very important to secure that. If you are a billionaire, you literally wouldn't notice $100 missing. You should be looking at expected *utility* of money, which becomes extremely large the closer you get to ruin. So to protect against the worst loss, you would want to invest into things that have roughly mutually exclusive ruin conditions. This generally also means that when one of your assets rises in price, your hedge performs worst. Meanwhile you will see the people who aren't diversified get rich so much faster than you, but that is an illusion. They will also get poor faster in a possible crisis.",
