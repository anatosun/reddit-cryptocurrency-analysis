It's basic, poorly designed, and simple to use.\n\nIf I had to choose, I would say Exodus. It's [partly open source](https://support.exodus.com/article/89-is-exodus-open-source) and the co-founder has done quite a lot of open source stuff. Exodus has a reputation to uphold in order to keep its userbase and earn the fees it does from transactions using its integrated exchange/conversion feature (if you want to use it). You get your keys and your wallet is encrypted. [Neither is stored on their servers](https://support.exodus.com/article/46-where-are-my-private-keys-stored). It also has a mobile version on the Play Store that functions perfectly.\n\nElectrum has me more worried because as good as people say it is, I can't help but wonder how much effort really goes into the software when the devs can't even get icons to fit in boxes properly, or have text scale proportionately with window size... Also, while they say you can verify the signatures, the process is broken and cannot be done. Supporting instructions to verify the signatures are out of date. I suspect the 'option' to verify signatures is sufficient for some to implicitly trust there is a level of security, but in reality it's unverifiable. There is also a broken version on the Play Store. Basic oversights like this concern me greatly as it's typically a reflection of sloppy coding and support all around.\n\nOpen source doesn't always mean better. The modem software on your phone is closed source while the Android OS is partly open source. This is to ensure security. The same concept applies to Exodus.\n\nWhat about [Bitcoin Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)? It's the oldest Bitcoin Wallet and seems like the best of both worlds? I use it too, and I like it quite a bit!",
