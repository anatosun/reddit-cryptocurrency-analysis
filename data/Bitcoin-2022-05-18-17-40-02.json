You will then create a loss because your cost basis was higher than your proceeds. \n\n\nNow you have a 10k tax loss and if I am not mistaken you can use 3k a year to offset your loss. That means that if your total yearly taxable income is 50k, your tax burden will only cover 47k, 47k, 47k, 49k. The next 4 taxable years you can reduce your tax burden by that realized loss. You will carry 3k, 3k, 3k and finally 1k of that tax loss to reduce your tax burden\n\n\nVery likely someone will agree with this or comment on what I got wrong.",

Smh. \n\n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/virtual-currencies\n\n\nWhat is Virtual Currency?\nVirtual currency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value. In some environments, it operates like \u201creal\u201d currency (i.e., the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that is designated as legal tender, circulates, and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance), but it does not have legal tender status in  the U.S. Cryptocurrency is a type of virtual currency that utilizes cryptography to validate and secure transactions that are digitally recorded on a distributed ledger, such as a blockchain.\n\nVirtual currency that has an equivalent value in real currency, or that acts as a substitute for real currency, is referred to as \u201cconvertible\u201d virtual currency. Bitcoin is one example of a convertible virtual currency. Bitcoin can be digitally traded between users and can be purchased for, or exchanged into, U.S. dollars, Euros, and other real or virtual currencies.\n\nTax Consequences\nThe sale or other exchange of virtual currencies, or the use of virtual currencies to pay for goods or services, or holding virtual currencies as an investment, generally has tax consequences that could result in tax liability.\n\nThe IRS issued IRS Notice 2014-21, IRB 2014-16, as guidance for individuals and businesses on the tax treatment of transactions using virtual currencies.\n\nThe IRS also published Frequently Asked Questions on Virtual Currency Transactions for individuals who hold cryptocurrency as a capital asset and are not engaged in the trade or business of selling cryptocurrency.",
