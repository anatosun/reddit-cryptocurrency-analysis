            "selftext": "Last week I went into a local primary school to talk to Year 6 (age 10-11) students about Bitcoin. I showed them a chart of how the price of a Freddo chocolate bar has changed over time and they were appalled to find out that they were paying three times as much as I had at their age! When I asked them why they thought the price had gone up, they came up with a range of sensible answers relating to supply and demand - and one of them even volunteered that there is more money now than in the past. It was a great \"hook\" to introduce Bitcoin and why its fixed supply is important. \n\nI'm hoping to do more school sessions and I'd love to hear about your experience explaining Bitcoin to children. What works? What doesn't? Do you have any effective analogies / activities / games to get them thinking along the right lines?\n\nThanks!\n\nMSW - Data Analyst at [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)\n\n(P.S. Why not set up a DCA and [Buy Bitcoin](https://www.coincorner.com/Bitcoin-Auto-Buy) regularly without worrying about the price?!)",

Then put a real $100 bill up as the prize for the winner.  Remember: You and you alone have access to the plastic thing with the rest of the chips.  \n\nStart playing poker.  Feel free to dip into the extra chips any time you feel like it, to raise the pot.  The idea is, you don't want to lose your real $100 bill.  \n\nWhen the other contestants complain, explain to them that as the Central Banker it is your job and duty:  \n* to inject liquidity into the system  \n* to provide 'necessary' inflation  \n* to stimulate the economy  \n* to prevent deflation  \n\nWhen they call your bluff, CALMLY inform them that this is EXACTLY how their own financial system actually works.  They should be *used to it* by now.  It's never bothered them before.  Why make such a fuss now?  \n\nThen mention the special computer...

You're giving answers instead of allowing minds to explore and self-learn.\n\nDon't have the goal of orange pilling kids, that's almost immoral in my opinion, do set a spark.\n\nIntroduce Bitcoin for sure, don't introduce it as a solution to anything and maybe even disclaimer that not many people understand all the complexities of money and inflation, that it is a long and difficult thing to explain etc.\n\nI don't know, I just feel like witnessing this sort of what I can only describe as an intentional radicalisation would concern me even if it were pro bitcoin (considering I'm pro Bitcoin).",
