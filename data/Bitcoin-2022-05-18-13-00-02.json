Before that it was even worse, where you had to buy the stock paper form and store safely - the exchanges were literally people yelling with paper slips across a room.  \nThe barrier of entry for investing in stocks have been almost entirely eliminated and you see way more retail investors i 2022 than in 1992. \n\n  \nI believe the cryptospace will be the same - we will get a better regulation (which hopefully will not be too restrictive), the spread/commission fees on exchanges will optimize, taxation law on crypto will become more fair and easier to report etc. - the barrier of entry will go down and more people can start investing. At the same time, the technology and market will mature and it will become less volatile, making more people willing to risk having assets allocated in the space.",

People commonly invested in people's businesses privately well before the stock market and the only thing that changed then it was easier to do so through a network and a broker to buy on the New York stock exchange instead of having to meet up with every investor. NYSE basically just facilitated and consolidated investors to shop at one place but was overly familiar to businessmen at this point. Take for instance the Dutch East India company for example that controlled and held the monopoly on trade for decades back in it's prime. The stock market wasn't established by any means, but investors waited in line to become shareholders and ride the wave of success and this was back in the 16th century. \n\nPlus stocks in general are pretty easy to understand as they are representative of a portion of control and ownership of the underlying company. Bitcoin is by no means a company and you don't own a share of any income earning business so it's very much less understood to most investors.",

Ask them how the current price of any particular stock is determined, and you'll probably hear lots of them say, \"the stock exchange sets it,\" \"the government,\" or similar nonsense.",

As opposed to Bitcoin which doesn't offer any hint of familiarity. Still not a great apples to apples analogy here. \n\nThis pattern has happened time and again while Bitcoin is something totally different. Investors that invested in the first railroad in America hadn't seen and didn't understand the concept of what a steam locomotive train looked like, because they didn't have to. All they had to know was they were investing in a business that found a new means of transportation to transport goods faster and safer through America's heartland. Again with Bitcoin the concept is just unfamiliar because it's not a business so investors don't understand the underlying technology and it's not a business so then they are left asking well what am I investing in.",

Create a signed, timelocked transaction that spends your whole stack and pays out to your heirs in whatever amounts you wish. Set the timelock conveniently far in the future, such as for one year. Keep the signed transaction among your personal effects, such that you will notice if it's been disturbed. Halfway to the timelock expiry, destroy the transaction and create a new one with a fresh timelock. As long as you remain alive, the signed transaction in your possession will never be valid. After you die, your heirs will have to wait until the timelock expires, and then they can broadcast your signed transaction to receive the payouts that you intended. Periodically check in with your heirs to confirm that they haven't lost the keys you gave them. If you move (or add to) your stack, then you'll need to replace your signed transaction. If you find or suspect that your signed transaction has been compromised, then you should move your stack to a new address and replace the signed transaction.",
