If they keep the 25/75% split a good chunk of people will continue staking there rather then move onchain. If its 3% on coinbase and 15% on rocketpool, I'll eat the gas fees at that point.",

I'm asking a technical question, not a philosophical one.)\n\nI keep hearing that Ethereum layer-1 is capable of doing something on the order of 13 transactions per second (give or take, depending on the complexity of the transaction). Why is that? Like, what exactly is so expensive about processing Ethereum transactions, such that a normal computer can only do 13 of them in a second?\n\nI understand that L1 (rightly!) prioritizes decentralization, and that from now on apps should be built on L2s, and that L2s' TPS can be much much higher.\n\nI understand that Ethereum L1 is meant to run on consumer hardware, for the sake of decentralization, and so throughput is intentionally kept low enough that reasonably-cheap hardware can handle it.\n\nI'm just kinda confused because 13 TPS still seems like a surprisingly low number for a modern-but-ordinary consumer laptop. How is all that time being spent?\n\n(e.g. I'm imagining that the answer might be something like, \"Modern cryptographic hash functions are pretty expensive to run, and Ethereum nodes have to do a whole bunch of hashes for every block, and that's where most of the time goes.\" Or, \"Every block requires downloading a whole bunch of data; most of the time is spent waiting for data to be transferred over the network.\" Or something like that. But I'm just making those up; I don't know what the real costs are, so I'm wondering if anyone here can help me understand.)",

You can check it yourself knowing that there are 15M gas on average per block every ~13s and 21k gas per transaction. \n\nTo be noted: some chains advertise their maximum TPS rather than their average TPS. To compare maximum TPS, simply double the average TPS of Ethereum, as it's 15M gas on average, but 30M gas max. Though consuming max gas would be extremely expensive extremely quickly, as for many other chains.\n\nThe biggest issue with more TPS is storing the result in the chain. The ever growing size of the chain is a problem in itself, as nodes aren't paid, they're benevolent.\n\nThere is work intended to be done about that, notably to reduce the chain size: notably statelightness and statelessness. But it's still far from being the priority.\n\nThe best bet to improve scalability indeed is to ensure work is done off chain (hence layer 2) and data storage consumption per data is reduced (data compression).",

            "selftext": "So I know it's gonna be very controversial to post a lot of pro-Ethereum stuff in /r/ethereum given all the maxis and ETH killer moonboys who love to spread FUD in every thread. And it's very easy to attack Ethereum when you don't understand what it's trying to be and what it's trying to achieve. So I figured I'd post all the general statements that I and many other have been making over and over for a while now. I'm happy to elaborate on any of them, but please keep the discussion in good faith. I'm also willing to add more points if I forgot some. Some of these are my own opinion, some definitely require more context to understand properly (again, happy to elaborate) but the goal is to quickly summarize all the different stuff that gets brought up over and over.\n\nAnyway yeah, if you're invested in Ethereum, or at the very least interested in it enough to be browsing this sub (why else would you be here lol) then you should be aware of the following:\n\n1. Ethereum is the network, Ether is the currency. And there is no \"I\" anywhere in the name.\n\n2. [Fees are high](https://cryptofees.info/) because that's how much the market values Ethereum's limited blockspace. It's purely supply and demand.\n    * Fees scale with [how much computation is being executed](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/transactions/), not how much money is being handled. It costs $5 on average to send any amount of Ether, whether it's $1's worth or $1 million's. It costs much more to do swaps and mint NFTs and such because those operations require more computation.\n    * There is no way for anyone to artificially keep fees high unless they're willing to [literally burn millions of dollars per day for no reason](https://watchtheburn.com/).\n\n3. Ethereum's blockspace is limited because letting people run nodes themselves on average consumer hardware is important for decentralization.\n    * Decentralization is a spectrum and has many meanings from protocol specification, protocol implementation, node distribution, coin distribution, censorship resistance, permissionlessness, etc.\n    * Pointing at one aspect to scream \"centralized\" isn't clever nor helpful. Chances are the aspect you point out is known and is an active area of research with a concrete plan on [the roadmap](https://i.imgur.com/vXMaIyZ.png) to address it and increase decentralization some more.\n    * No blockchain is ever fully decentralized, especially not from the start \u2013 and Ethereum's end goal is to be able to run without a hiccup for *decades* if not *centuries*. At 6.5 years old, it's still very young.\n    * If you care about decentralization, invest in and contribute to projects like Ethereum who view it as a goal, not a crutch that \"nobody cares about it that much anyway, let's just [increase the gas limit](https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc/issues/553) to have low fees asap\"\n\n4. There is a [vast difference](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#node-types) between an \"archive node\" (several TBs) and a \"full node\" (hundreds of GBs)\n    * Running an archive node is not necessary to sync from genesis and verify blocks and transactions.\n    * A full node has all the information enough to generate an archive node.\n    * There are plans on [the roadmap](https://i.imgur.com/vXMaIyZ.png) to reduce the storage/bandwidth/RAM requirements of nodes even more, to a point where a smartphone will be able to independently verify and propagate new blocks. \n\n5. There is no \"when eth2 rolls out\" or \"when devs release eth2\" or god forbid \"when ethereum is upgraded to 2.0\". What there is instead is a roadmap consisting of a series of upgrades aiming to help rollups \u2013 *not the base layer* \u2013 scale to hundreds of thousands of TPS.\n    * Depending on context, Eth1 is usually synonymous with \"execution layer\" and Eth2 usually means \"consensus layers\" ([helpful illustration](https://i.imgur.com/AHHcUgm.png)) otherwise \"eth2\" is an umbrella term for the set of upgrades over a long period of time, but the fact remains that there is no specific instant in time where \"eth1 turns into eth2\".\n    * Similarly, there is no \"eth2\" coin. ETH is ETH, you don't have to do anything, the coins you hold today will be the same after the switch to proof of stake.\n\n6. Unlocking staked Ether [will not cause a mass sell-off event](https://twitter.com/domothy/status/1467387422765953029). There is a limited withdrawing queue, it's not gonna happen all at once. And there are many more reasons for more people to start staking Ether than there are for the current stakers to exit en masse.\n    * Also, unlocking staked Ether will not be possible directly after the merge. Withdrawals will be enable in the first fork that follows the merge ~6 months later.\n\n7. There are plenty of options to avoid high gas fees, it's perfectly fine to use a sidechain to do your DeFi stuff for now. I use sidechains myself too. Just don't pretend these sidechains will replace Ethereum in any significant way as that's not even what they're trying to do.\n\n8. Switching to Proof of Stake [will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly](https://willthemergelowergasprices.org/). Anyone saying otherwise is either misinformed or trying to mislead you into false expectations to bank on the inevitable mass disappointment following the merge.\n    * It's still a monumental upgrade that will render possible much-needed upgrades like light clients, statelessness, and sharding, etc. that would otherwise be impossible or impractical to implement on the current proof of work chain.\n    * It's basically a way to \"start from scratch\" while keeping the same coin, same users, same dapps, same network effects.\n    * PoS has been on the roadmap [since day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/). Yes, estimates of PoS dates have been wrong before. However right now it's all hands on deck on the merge, the spec is done, the beacon chain is running, there is a [merge testnet running](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/12/20/kintsugi-merge-testnet/), it's happening.\n\n9. Sharding will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly either. Sharding is all about *data*, execution on Layer 1 will still be limited and expensive. What data sharding will do is help rollups (Layer 2) scale by several orders of magnitude.\n\n10. [Rollups](https://mirror.xyz/ethmaxitard.eth/iyCAlOexgQKOvoSAAk4utYGEdnESOKb5HstM2_LaqL4) are [already live today](https://l2beat.com/) and they will only [get cheaper](https://l2fees.info/) as more people use them.\n\n11. [Data sharding + rollups is the only sustainable way](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pk57n7/why_rollups_data_shards_are_the_only_sustainable/) to scale a blockchain globally without compromising decentralization.\n    * \"Sustainable\" as in the overall security model doesn't rely on hoping that the coin's price will pump forever to outpace the dilution from the blockchain issuing way more new coins than they collect in fees. Something that all major blockchains (including Ethereum most days, and even Bitcoin) are currently doing.\n    * \"Without compromising decentralization\" as in more decentralization = more data for rollups = more scaling (lower individual fees on L2). Decentralization becomes an integral part of the scaling equation rather than a crutch.\n    * [The rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698) is all about admitting that no single blockchain can do it all by itself and can't compete with what rollups can do. In other words, \"Ethereum maximalism\" amounts to helping independent teams develop rollups, innovate and compete with each other on top of Ethereum's secure, decentralized, and open platform.\n    * The true competition of sidechains is rollups, not Ethereum itself. \n    * All the criticisms of a multi-rollup world apply to the current multi-chain world model as well. Except they apply way more to the multi-chain world and can be overcome way more easily in a multi-rollup world.\n    * A rollup can settle on any L1, sure, but it's gonna gravitate towards the most secure, most decentralized and most credibly neutral settlement layer with the best data availability. Right now only Bitcoin and Ethereum fit those criteria (other L1s optimize for fast execution, not secure data availability) and Bitcoin would need a hard fork to implement rollup-friendly functions, so that only leaves Ethereum as the poised [\"AWS for blockchain\"](https://twitter.com/domothy/status/1465905887541972996).\n\n12. Ether isn't meant to be a day-to-day currency that will replace fiat. The use-case of Ether isn't to pay for bread and milk, it's to pay for gas fees and secure the network. All the other use-cases derive from Ether's scarcity, but they're not strictly necessary.\n    * Having Ether be an appreciating asset is good for the overall long-term health of the network by providing it with more [economic security, its holders more economic bandwidth](https://i.imgur.com/AErfdod.png), and its users more reasons to hold/stake. The incoming deflation is good.\n    * However, the supply is not gonna be deflationary forever. The market dictates how much the blockspace is worth (so how much gets burned) and it also dictates how much the staking APR should be (so how much gets printed) so these two opposing forces will meet in the middle at some point. It's all about [them feedback loops](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png).\n\n13. The security model trumps the economic model. The core idea behind the economic model is: \"[Minimum viable issuance to secure the network](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/izhkvk/minimum_viable_issuance_why_ethereums_lack_of_a/)\". It was designed from the start to be [disinflationary](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/04/10/the-issuance-model-in-ethereum/) (as in, inflation % terms goes down over time) with even the idea of fee burning being mentioned in [early](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/) publications and [FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ/ba766606790d80422b23650d3326e2d963bdfa87)\n\n14. It's okay to change or tweak things when new research indicates there's a problem with long-term sustainability or security of the current model. These changes don't happen \"on a whim of a few people\", there's a lot of consideration that go into them.\n    * And remember, changes happen in a highly adversarial context. If there's *any* possibility of an upgrade causing security problems or being exploited in any way for profit, then it *will* happen. Changes don't just happen for fun \"just because\", they happen when their benefits outweigh the inherent risks of potentially adding more complexity.\n\n15. The Ethereum Foundation is more of a [coordinator than a dictator](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy/). It's much more of a community-focused bottom-up approach than the top-down structure people think.\n    * Everything happens extremely transparently on open forums that no one reads and [public livestream calls](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumFoundation/videos) that no one listens to. But everyone who wants to participate is welcome, it's all out in the open.\n    * The Ethereum Foundation doesn't code any of the actual software, client teams do. There are 5 major execution clients and 4 major consensus clients, developed by independent teams, to implement the protocol specification. This multi-client approach may be responsible for development delays, but it comes with [security benefits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mreacw/psa_the_importance_of_multiclient_and_why_the/)\n    * [Anyone can propose an Ethereum Improvement Proposal](https://ethereum.org/en/eips/). You just have to convince others it's a good idea to implement it (most EIPs don't get implemented and fall into obscurity) and the clients could just refuse to code it in if it's a very bad idea. The more time passes, the harder it becomes to push changes to the Ethereum protocol and everything converges to the status quo. (This doesn't close the door to further innovation however, as it's still an open platform on which anyone can build)\n    * Vitalik regularly gets his proposals blocked by client teams, other researchers, or the community in general. At most, he's a knowledgeable influence because he knows the tech and cryptography in depth and has been there from the beginning. It's silly to worship him, and it's silly to treat him as Ethereum's Zucc-like CEO. He's \"just some guy\".\n\n16. The \"[DAO hard fork](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-779)\" wasn't a roll-back. Not a single transaction was reverted, no one lost any funds other than the exploiter who could have otherwise gotten away with [15% of the total supply at the time](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2016/06/25/understanding-the-dao-attack/). It wasn't a bailout of Vitalik and his pals, it was a bailout of a huge chunk of the community from an event that could have killed the whole thing in its infancy. \n    * In the end it's all social consensus, and the consensus from miners, users, developers was strong. Even \"code is law\" is social consensus that [can get reverted in case of major bugs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident). It's all about what the community deems [legitimate](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html).\n    * *edit: see comments for more nuance on this point*\n\n17. As far as the [initial distribution](https://i.imgur.com/k3GB8Lh.png) goes, Ethereum's ICO is among [the best of those who had an ICO](https://i.imgur.com/fmW3ytf.png), and as far as the current distribution goes (after 6 years of proof of work and market movements), it's [on par with Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). 60m of the 72m \"pre-mined\" coins went to a permissionless no-KYC sale, and [all the genesis transactions are included in Block #0](https://etherscan.io/txs?block=0) so you can check yourself that there's no hidden coins. Just like Bitcoin, early investors took on big risks and got big rewards. No surprises here. Any concerns of the ICO being a scam or rugpull should have vanished some time in 2015, yet here we are still talking about it for some reason.\n    * And if coin distribution is a concern to you because proof of stake, then you should be glad the DAO hack didn't end up with a single person owning 15% of the supply...\n    * *edit: see comments for more nuance on this point too lol*\n\n18. There is no \"technical debt\" preventing Ethereum from scaling.\n\n19. EIP-1559 was [not meant to lower gas fees](https://web.archive.org/web/20210205013340/https://willeip1559lowergasprices.org/) and no credible person ever promised it was a scaling solution.\n    * It has [many benefits](https://domothy.com/eip1559/) beyond coin burning. The deflation is a nice side effect, and it's certainly not a gimmick meant to pump the price.\n\n20. Proof of Work is really just Proof of Stake with extra steps.\n    * In both systems, the goal is reach consensus in a sybil-resistant way. Spending time and energy by computing hashes over and over is just the easiest way to reach that goal. But if we can achieve that goal (randomness + verifiable delay functions) without using the energy of a continent, maybe we should look into it.\n    * In both systems, whoever has capital gets to earn more capital by producing more blocks. (Except in Proof of Stake, everyone earns at the same rate, proportional to how much they stake)\n    * In both systems, the capital that someone has at stake (mining rigs vs coins directly) is a good indicative that they will play by the rules.\n    * By design, [Ethereum doesn't have on-chain governance](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/governance/#on-chain-governance). This means that the people with the most coins can't change the rules under PoS any more than the people with the most hash rate can change the rules under PoW.\n    * Just like there are mining pools, there are staking pools. As usual, some options are [more decentralized and community-focused](https://rocketpool.net/) than others.",

All the other use-cases derive from Ether's scarcity, but they're not strictly necessary.\n\nThis hasn't always been true.  [See Vitalik's memorable bag on Bitcoin's failure to scale its L1](https://youtu.be/qPsCGvXyrP4?t=3869), for an example.  At the time, he was pushing for massive scaling of L1, and even had an early Casper toy model showing block times of 4 seconds and throughput of thousands of transactions per second. (Unfortunately I can't find the source video for this, but I remember it being a presentation, and the output was just console output of a cli tool, very barebones).\n\nPart of the original plan [was indeed L2s](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/09/17/scalability-part-1-building-top/), the other part was definitely [L1 improvements via sharding](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/10/21/scalability-part-2-hypercubes/).  Part of the focus on L1 scaling was specifically to enable the \"day-to-day currency\" use-case, i.e. the one in the \"the internet of money\" quote.\n\nThe narrative that Ethereum *isn't* supposed to be a day-to-day currency has evolved *in response* to Ethereum's lack of ability to scale.  This is a direct parallel to the evolution of the \"store of value\" narrative in Bitcoin, which *also* started as a \"peer-to-peer cash equivalent\".  The idea that there are cases that derive from \"Ether's scarcity\" is also a more recent narrative development; this is especially apparent when you consider that Ether wasn't [intended to be scarce in the first place](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/s8mnwb/a_collection_of_various_things_the_average/htkktzm/?context=3).\n\nMore post-hoc rationalization from the community in general.  I mean, it's fine to evolve a narrative over time in response to reality; what's rather disingenuous is to pretend that the new narrative has *always* been the narrative.  Strong \"we have always been at war with Eastasia\" vibes.\n\n> The Ethereum Foundation is more of a coordinator than a dictator. It's much more of a community-focused bottom-up approach than the top-down structure people think.\n\nAgain, see the [Tyranny of Structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm).  All this particular organizational structure has done is replace explicit hierarchies with implicit ones that are only navigable through political means.  Decentralization on this front almost always results in *more* consolidation of power, not *less*.  Again, see also [Vitalik's post on legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), which addresses the same set of problems from a different angle.\n\n> There is no \"technical debt\" preventing Ethereum from scaling.\n\nThere actually is a good amount of technical debt. The majority of it stems from the focus on L1 scaling early on, presumably due to the lack of actual solutions for scaling the EVM itself.\n\nBut don't take my word for it: [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/sbppnq/what_technical_debt_all_credit_to/hu4860j/) seems to sum up some notable examples.\n\nIt's worthwhile to point out that while \"technical debt is preventing Ethereum from scaling\" is a potent FUD narrative against Ethereum, despite only being partly correct, \"what technical debt?\" is equally vapid.  As a general rule of thumb: anyone trying to come up with clever comebacks to narratives is probably more interested in popularity than in ensuring that people have adequate information to combat said narratives.  If anything, they're probably trying to distract from the valid criticisms that effective negative narratives contain.",

The core idea behind the economic model is, has always been, and will always be: \"Minimum viable issuance to secure the network\".\n\nThis is false.  Specifically, Ethereum's policy has not \"always been\" \"minimum viable issuance\" or \"minimum necessary issuance.\"  The first instance of either of those phrases appears to be early 2019, judging by google search + web.archive.org.\n\nEthereum's original economic policy was \"5 Ether per block, in perpetuity\", with the intent that \"5 Ether per block\" would represent an increasingly small rate of inflation as the monetary base grows.\n\nIf you wish to counter that claim, please find a reference to this concept (hopefully the exact phrase, but an explanation would do) that predates, say, 2018.\n\n> Anyone can propose an Ethereum Improvement Proposal.

To date, I've not seen a single Vitalik-supported EIP get rejected; nor have I seen a single Vitalik-rejected EIP get accepted.  If either of these is a regular occurrence, I suspect this will be easy to provide.\n\n> It wasn't a bailout of Vitalik and his pals, it was a bailout of a huge chunk of the community from an event that could have killed the whole thing in its infancy.\n\nThis is also incorrect.  The biggest voter turnouts were less than [15% of hashrate](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4tffta/hard_fork_voting_and_node_adoption_results/) and less than [10% of coins](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6d62td/the_story_behind_ethereum_classic_etc_and_whos/di3a0ql/).  This is neither a \"huge chunk of the community\" nor (more importantly) a majority of the community.  The implication of this basic fact is that this was indeed a *minority bailout fork*. \n\nIn fact, the *only* deciding factor was which side of the fork was chosen to be the default by the developer-sanctioned clients.  In fact, Vitalik goes on to admit this in his writing about \"legitimacy\", the very one you linked.  The chain that the core developers committed to continuing development on was the \"legitimate chain\", because they lent it their legitimacy.  Let's not forget that the one vote that was supposedly a \"community vote\" that \"determined what the default option would be\" was originally and explicitly called out as *not being an official vote*, with those same developers committing to never treat it as such.  They then changed their minds on this approximately 12 hours before they released the client*s* that would support this fork, indicating that the core developers had already decided *internally* what the outcome would be.\n\nIn a network that cannot achieve a majority quorum of voters, the controlling stake is controlled by whoever gets to set the defaults and deem to be the \"legitimate\" outcome.  In this case, that was Vitalik and a (relatively) small set of developers of the Ethereum clients.  I've [talked about this in depth](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7y166g/on_the_topic_of_decentralized_governance/dud1evl/) when considering the implications of Ethereum's \"opt-out\" governance model.\n\nLet's not forget that [Vitalik was actively buying DAO tokens at the time](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/741832934814949377).  If that's not an economic indicator that he had total confidence that the fork would happen, even before community votes happened, I don't know what could convince anyone.  Economic incentives are what this entire ecosystem is built on, are they not?\n\nAdditionally, the [DAO hack was not an existential threat](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4rohdy/vlad_zamfirs_thoughts_on_the_hard_fork/d52s60v/).\n\n> As far as the initial distribution goes\n\nThis sidesteps the issue that the initial distribution was 100% opaque, and there *were no restrictions placed on insiders buying tokens in their own crowdsale*.  In fact, there's no plausible way [Joe Lubin](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/11/sale-of-the-century-the-inside-story-of-ethereums-2014-premine/) (for example, ctrl+f for his name) could have as much Ethereum as he did without participating in the sale himself.  As a beneficiary of the sale, this allows him to essentially buy Ether from himself during the crowdsale, as no cost (whenever he gets paid back).  In fact, before the crowdsale was even done, the Ethereum Foundation was [already taking distributions](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/08/announcement-on-planned-exodus-withdrawal/) from the Exodus address to \"pay back loans\".  Who were those loans being paid back to?  It's plausible that some of these were loans taken out by insiders to buy tokens in the crowdsale, after which they paid back the loans and kept the purchased Ether.\n\nThis is the crucial difference between an ICO (Ethereum's in particular) and a public IPO: insiders are explicitly not allowed to participate in an IPO because they are the primary beneficiaries of the IPO.  There exist transparency requirements and legal restrictions that prevent double-dipping in IPOs; no such mechanisms existed in the Ethereum ICO.  In fact, from a purely economic standpoint, the beneficiaries of the Ethereum crowdsale would be considered \"irrational\" to *not* participate in their own sale, minting tokens for \"free\".  Given the pseudonymous nature of both Ethereum and Bitcoin, to anyone outside the scheme, their purchases would look identical to participants from \"the public\".  The *only* way to expose such a scheme would be for an insider to reveal the scheme.",

You definitely don't deserve to get downvoted.\n\nIt looks like you're right about minimum viable issuance, I looked up the earliest versions of the yellow paper I could find and it really does just mention 5 ETH/block, with basic sentences about how mining rewards are there to secure the network but it doesn't seem much thought was put in that number beyond the fact that the math worked out that the annual issuance would be 0.3x the public sale (not sure about the causality link though)\n\n>with the intent that \"5 Ether per block\" would represent an increasingly small rate of inflation as the monetary base grows\n\nI know you're not really denying it but it's still worth to note the block time was also gonna decrease substantially as the difficulty bomb would be set off. So that in itself was like Bitcoin's predictible issuance schedule except the block time was the variable increasing rather than the reward per block decreasing. By the time the bomb got delayed, reducing the block reward to 3 ETH/block actually *increased* Miners' overall rewards by lowering the block time and that was the reasoning given in the EIP that pushed the bomb and reduced the reward (the alternative of not delaying the bomb being of course that the network would crawl to a halt with huge block times). Of course rewards didn't jump up to the level they were at 5 ETH pre-bomb, but the point is it was always the case from the start that miners would progressively get less and less due to increasing block time. So the narrative I often see that \"they lowered the rewards from 5 to 3 to 2 just to screw with miners\" is misleading.\n\nBut admittedly this is totally besides the point and not even what you're arguing for. I concede that MVI wasn't as set in stone as I believed, so I'll edit my post to reflect that. The weaker claim is that (like you pointed out) being [disinflationary](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/04/10/the-issuance-model-in-ethereum/) was the policy from the start and they have not shown any intention to change course on that, especially not today when MVI *is* a core policy.\n\n(Some interesting articles I found were [this one](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/) from 2016 that talked about possibly burning fees to avoid security problems. EIP-1559 definitely didn't come out of nowhere!)\n\n>To date, I've not seen a single Vitalik-supported EIP get rejected; nor have I seen a single Vitalik-rejected EIP get accepted. If either of these is a regular occurrence, I suspect this will be easy to provide.\n\nThere are plenty of stagnant EIPs Vitalik has authored that will likely never get implemented. I have to admit my initial claim isn't as strong as it could be, like you I'm not aware of EIPs that have explicitly been rejected, but I also haven't been there from the beginning to know which one he does or does not support.\n\nThe best example I can point out would be a recent one: He authored EIP-4488 and tried to get it before the merge but was veto'd mainly by Geth devs who (rightly) pointed out there wasn't enough time to study the security/economic implications of such a change and now the EIP is on ice despite having strong support from Vitalik and the community (because cheaper rollups). You could argue it's likely it'll still get implemented (either 4488 itself or something more like multidimensional eip-1559), just not before the merge. But that's one example of Vitalik not getting what he wants. Another one would be removing the self-destruct opcode, something he's been advocating for a long time and never got any real traction and it's still here to this day despite his multiple objections.\n\n>for example, ctrl+f for his name\n\nI did. Does your claim about Joe boil down to this one sentence? \"*Joe Lubin is rumored to be the biggest holder of ETH to come out of the crowdsale, though he says that\u2019s not the case.*\"\n\n> Who were those loans being paid back to? It's plausible that some of these were loans taken out by insiders to buy tokens in the crowdsale, after which they paid back the loans and kept the purchased Ether.\n\nIt's plausible maybe, but that amounts to trying to prove a negative doesn't it? As far as the loans go I would assume being a non-profit they'd be required to disclose that sorta stuff, but I can't pretend to know where to look for that stuff myself or if that even apply in Switzerland. Do you know if anybody ever looked deeply into all the publicly available financial statements from the EF?\n\n>The only way to expose such a scheme would be for an insider to reveal the scheme.\n\nAlso going down the plausibility hole, why *didn't* any of them expose it?

So that in itself was like Bitcoin's predictible issuance schedule except the block time was the variable increasing rather than the reward per block decreasing. By the time the bomb got delayed, reducing the block reward to 3 ETH/block actually increased Miners' overall rewards by lowering the block time and that was the reasoning given in the EIP that pushed the bomb and reduced the reward (the alternative of not delaying the bomb being of course that the network would crawl to a halt with huge block times). Of course rewards didn't jump up to the level they were at 5 ETH pre-bomb, but the point is it was always the case from the start that miners would progressively get less and less due to increasing block time. So the narrative I often see that \"they lowered the rewards from 5 to 3 to 2 just to screw with miners\" is misleading.\n\nIt turns out this is yet another post-hoc rationalization.  As far as the early emission schedule was concerned, the effect of the Ice Age wasn't really considered.  In fact, this whole notion of \"but the Ice Age would reduce issuance\" can only be traced back to the original EIPs (either the first or second) that proposed reducing the issuance in the first place; and it wasn't proposed as a mechanism until after it was pointed out that the issuance was supposed to be constant anyway.  The [original Ice Age mechanism](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/04/ethereum-protocol-update-1/) also mentions nothing about reducing issuance.\n\nIn other words, the narrative about the Ice Age being intended to reduce issuance (or implied to) is [post-hoc rationalization](https://skepticink.com/tippling/2013/11/14/post-hoc-rationalisation-reasoning-our-intuition-and-changing-our-minds/).\n\nReducing the issuance wasn't to \"screw miners\", it was to satiate the needs of bagholders who believed that reducing issuance would increase price.  In fact, the [proposer](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5l9j59/december_roundup_ethereum_blog/dbufcd6/?context=3) of the original EIP [explicitly stated this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/5jem1h/any_eth_investors_know_much_about_github/).\n\nSadly, this kind of historical revisionism is rampant among various proponents of Ethereum, the core devs included.\n\n> But admittedly this is totally besides the point and not even what you're arguing for. I concede that MVI wasn't as set in stone as I believed, so I'll edit my post to reflect that. The weaker claim is that (like you pointed out) being disinflationary was the policy from the start and they have not shown any intention to change course on that, especially not today when MVI is a core policy.\n\nI would agree with the claim that Ethereum was always intended to be disinflationary, but specifically by nature of having a flat issuance rate indefinitely.\n\n> The best example I can point out would be a recent one: He authored EIP-4488 and tried to get it before the merge but was veto'd mainly by Geth devs who (rightly) pointed out there wasn't enough time to study the security/economic implications of such a change and now the EIP is on ice despite having strong support from Vitalik and the community (because cheaper rollups).

We'll see if they don't *eventually* get implemented, but for now they aren't and don't appear to be immediately on the roadmap for inclusion.\n\n> I did. Does your claim about Joe boil down to this one sentence? \"Joe Lubin is rumored to be the biggest holder of ETH to come out of the crowdsale, though he says that\u2019s not the case.\"\n\nMy claim is also based on the ridiculously large amount of Ether (specifically) Consensys has thrown at various startups an incubators over the years.  He also has claimed to other people to be a \"crypto billionaire\" multiple times over the years (including to reporters and such), which would necessitate having hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of Ether at various times.  Getting that amount and not *already being* a billionaire implies that he got it when it was very cheap (i.e. the crowdsale).\n\nMany second-hand sources, but I'd imagine he has plausible deniability reasons for never making the claim on the record.\n\n> Also going down the plausibility hole, why didn't any of them expose it? Especially the ones who have since left the EF and started competing projects. It would be an easy move to go public and hurt Ethereum's credibility if there were any kind of proof or message trail to suggest such a move from insiders.\n\nBecause I imagine the reasons for doing it in the first place largely revolve around obtaining a large amount of money in a tax-free way.  Exposing the scheme would mean exposing their own fraud.  A double-bind, if you will.\n\n> But yeah, the opacity of the ICO does look sus from the angle you bring up, I guess that's the other side of the whole permissionless no KYC sale thing. Still, I would argue the time to worry about the presale being a scam to steal Bitcoin is long gone.\n\nI mean, yes and not.  PoS' entire security model relies on the *current* value of the Ether held; I'd posit that someone who bought millions of Ether for pennies would have far different incentives when it comes to burning it than someone who actually spent billions on similar quantities.  In fact, putting a dollar value on the security of Ether is totally flawed when the price *was* so low so long ago.\n\nThis is especially true given the amount of power that comes with controlling the consensus layer, given that switching to PoS was the plan all along.  What better way to ensure you always control who gets money out of the system than by buying a supermajority of the \"hashpower\" when it was very cheap; if you assume that the price will go up along the way, you end up in an unassailable position.\n\nCouple this with deflationary economic policy and you have a majority stake in the system that literally cannot be diluted away.  Seems rather dangerous.\n\n> For the rest of the points it looks like I have a lot more rabbitholes to fall into, you definitely bring a lot of nuance that I have to look into more deeply and it looks like you've been an informed part of the space for way longer than me. Again, all that stuff is welcome from me!\n\nOne of the advantages to being in the space for a long time is exposure to nuance, complications, and inconvenient truths that many of the strongest proponents would rather have forgotten.\n\nLike the fact that the [DAO fork was never necessary](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/805gcn/vitalik_said_doing_rescue_forks_in_exceptional/duveapx/?context=3), for one interesting example.  When you consider that from a technical standpoint the fork was never necessary, you're left with two plausible incentives to go ahead with it anyway:\n\n1. It carries slightly less risk than a purely on-chain solution\n2. You get to make a shitload of money if you bought a bunch of DAO tokens while the exchange rate was depressed due to the public sentiment.  The redemption rate of the withdrawal mechanism implemented by the hard fork was 100 DAO to 1 Eth; between the hack and the hard fork, DAO were trading at around 100 DAO to .7 Eth, on average.  If you a) knew the fork would happen because you controlled the defaults, and b) were buying DAO tokens while the price was depressed, you'd make a cool, risk-free 30+% profit after the fork.\n\n> It's pretty clear you know a lot about Ethereum's part, so I'm curious about your opinion about its future. Optimistic: yay or nay? And (if I can ask) are you invested in Ether to any significant degree?\n\nHighly pessimistic.  I've been thoroughly divested from Ether for a long time for ideological reasons.  I don't think the core developers in particular have the altruistic goals they claim they do, and refuse to support that by putting my money into the system.  However, at the same time, I think they're running a highly-effective con that just might actually produce something marginally useful through the power of collective delusion.  It also depends on your metric of success: if you think investing in Ether will make you rich? I'd think you're probably right, at least over the short- to medium-term.  If you think it'll actually be a \"revolutionary technology\"?  I don't think it ever will achieve that kind of goal.  At the end of the day, it's just replacing one set of elites with a different one.",

In fact, putting a dollar value on the security of Ether is totally flawed when the price was so low so long ago.\n\nAside from the fact that millions of pennies is still hundreds of thousands of dollars, your cost basis doesn't matter that much compared to how much money you're parting with by getting slashed. If you're burning a billion dollars' worth of Ether, then that's a billion dollars you could have gotten by selling your ETH at current prices (either OTC or spread out buys because liquidity) instead of doing the attack. So whatever incentives for the attack would still have to be greater than $1B even if you bought all those Ether for pennies.\n\nAlso, Vlad Zamfir's comment you linked about why the DAO hack wasn't an existential threat runs directly against that argument. The DAO hacker could have had ~15% of the supply (which would have been diluted to ~10% today) at a cost basis of effectively zero. The arguments he gave apply just as easily to an EF insider who would have gotten a crapton of Ether for cheap. (Except the EF insider's economic interests are much more Ethereum-aligned than some anon who ran an exploit, of course)\n\nSo is it or is it not a big deal for POS security if someone got a lot of Ether a long time ago for very cheap?",
