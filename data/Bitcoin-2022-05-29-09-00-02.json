Satoshi selling all of his Bitcoin would increase the circulating supply from 18 million to 19 million, so approximately 5.5%. I don't think that would be so terrible, especially when you know that Bitcoin's yearly inflation is currently already around 2%.",

See this reply by u/bitusher\n\n> This myth keeps being repeated\n> \n> Satoshi having 1 million BTC is a myth created by sergio which was quickly shown to be flawed and contradictory. Here is Sergio's original post -\n> \n> https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=175996.msg1832533#msg1832533\n> \n> and followup\n> \n> https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=178629.0\n> \n> Where Greg and others point out flaws in his research and how some of it is self contradictory\n> \n> Here is Bitmex's follow up research on the matter -\n> \n> https://blog.bitmex.com/satoshis-1-million-bitcoin/\n> \n>> In conclusion, although there is strong evidence of a dominant miner in 2009, we think the evidence is far less robust than many have assumed. Although a picture is worth a thousand words, sometimes pictures can be a little misleading. Even if one is convinced, the evidence only supports the claim that the dominant miner may have generated significantly less than a million bitcoin in our view. Perhaps 600,000 to 700,000 bitcoin is a better estimate.\n> >\n> > None of the above says much about whether the dominant miner was Satoshi, although we know Satoshi mined block 9, which we have allocated to the dominant miner in our analysis. However this is in a slope of just 11 blocks, so it\u2019s certainly not conclusive. Whoever the dominant miner was, it is of course possible the keys have been lost or discarded by now.\n> \n> Thus block 9 and genesis block was created by Satoshi 100%, and the evidence reflects he might have mined 11 blocks at least in addition to the genesis under these assumptions .\n> \n> This means the evidence suggests we definitely know satoshi mined 2 blocks , and likely mined 11 blocks, and that perhaps there was a dominant miner who mined between 600-700k bitcoin(not blocks). There are other explanations for the extranonce pattern that do not point to a dominant miner. Simply a similar software setup can cause this.\n> \n> Since there was over 3 days between the genesis block being mined and block 1 and difficulty was 1 it would be safer to assume satoshi waited for other miners to start mining before joining in .\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/pef7fu/i_remembered_im_satoshi_how_do_i_cash_out_a/haxcj50/?context=999",
