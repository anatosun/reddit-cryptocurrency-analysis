Absolute power corrupts absolutely. No exceptions. He's driving us into the ground to force people to work for unfair wages... to rebuild the working class. He's doing the government's work for them and pretending to be a man of the people. It's why he's always talking about the need for population growth. It's why the Roe vs. Wade thing became a big deal recently. The oligarchs need more people at the bottom of the pyramid to support them. He's the controlled opposition pretending to be on the good side of history but the veil is starting to fall because he's just about to a point where he doesn't need it anymore. That said, I still think Doge will get to $1 but not before, as Elon stated, the bankruptcies start rolling in.",

When people are taking over a country the first thing they did was ban indiginous people from having children, or they bred them out of existence through rape\n Or, they made the children join their army and sent them out of the country.",
