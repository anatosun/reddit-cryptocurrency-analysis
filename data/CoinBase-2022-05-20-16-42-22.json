Generally debit cards are instant while banks can take about a week, but they're not all the same.  Double check the confirmation window before a purchase to see how long it might take, and contact your bank to see if their transaction processing might have changed.  \n\nMore here: https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/buying-selling-or-converting-crypto/how-long-does-a-purchase-or-deposit-take-to-complete\n\nTrading is usually instant, but withdrawing will still depend on how long it takes your bank to complete that process.  \n\nWe hope that helps!",
