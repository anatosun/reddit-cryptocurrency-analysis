I tried making one of these things to help teach myself flask but I am nowhere near finished. here's a [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/bscosYU.jpg) in case you are curious.\n\n\n\nI do have some suggestions.\n\n* you are misidentifying some of the networks as sidechains\n* add a radio button to let me choose some different types of transactions, in case I don't know the gas amount. this might be challenging if the gas fee varies on each network\n* take snapshots from your APIs at hourly intervals and store them in a database. determine what is typically the best day of the week and the worst day of the week to do transactions in terms of fees\n* some analytics showing the relationship between transaction fees and other things going on with the asset or network might be interesting but it may go way beyond the scope of a simple fee calculator",

I have to scroll left and right too much. maybe squish it or change the layout on mobile. there is also a ton of whitespace on desktop and I have to scroll down to see what I need. maybe some of the stuff you have on there should go underneath instead of at the top. what I was going for with my own fee calculator was to make sure everything I need fits in a small space.",
