Another consideration is the change in the 'typical basket' of goods that we've come to purchase that has changed over time, and the ability of an economy to produce good and services over time and whether or not that has slowed / increased relative to the demand/ increase in standards of living. There are of course many other considerations.\n\nYou can't just pin it to \"printing money\", the so called direct costs to an increase in money supply is called seignorage and if you look it up the actual impact as a proportion to gdp is relatively tiny in most countries.\n\nBesides, a healthy amount of inflation (1-4% or depending on the country) is necessary for an economy to thrive.\n\nIf you consider the opposite case, where suppose we have a monetary system where we cannot expand the money supply, the implications are far worse. Goods and services will be deflationary since an economy always produces more but you only have fixed currency in circulation. This incentivices postponing spending and investment perpetually, leading to a deflationary spiral. You remove the ability for central banks to respond to shocks, leading to more volatile swings and longer recessions and crises when they do happen (and they will always happen). Flexible MS is a policy tool and is a very beneficial one.\n\nEnd quote.",
