Saying Tesla accepts doge for merch and literally like 1-2 items available to buy ( which goes out kf stock ) Also removing items that were available to buy in doge ughhhh. Similar thing would happen to spacex. Only the cheapest item available to buy isn't going to help doge. He pumped doge like anything abandoned it and is now doing similar things to twitter, not realizing individuals and employees are suffering. \n\nI have been a huge advocate of him and doge but like seriously, he has done nothing but hurt people. Twitter has gone into an absolute nightmarish mode with it's employees because of him. He may be a genius, but he is an extreme narcissist who only thinks about himself.",
