One that is especially promising is the introduction of decentralized applications ([dApp](https://getblock.io/blog/how-to-build-a-dapp-blockchain-developer-is-starter-pack-by-getblock/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo)), which are heavily reliant on blockchains and crypto.\n\nAt its core, each dApp combines a smart contract (a backend) and a frontend user interface. dApps are built by utilizing fully transparent codes governed by autonomy, and a specific consensus algorithm to back up their value (e.g. [Proof-of-Stake or Proof-of-Work](https://getblock.io/blog/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-whats-the-difference/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo)).\n\nMost applications we use in our day-to-day life are centralized. This means that everything contained and posted on the app, including its database, is owned and controlled by a single - centralized - entity. Some of the centralized apps examples are Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc. dApps are fundamentally different in their structure.\n\nN.B. Check out Getblock\u2019s [guide](https://getblock.io/blog/how-to-build-a-dapp-blockchain-developer-is-starter-pack-by-getblock/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) on how to build a dApp\n\nAs mentioned above, dApps are centered around blockchains with smart contract support. A smart contract is essentially a self-executing program stored on a blockchain, which contains an agreement between the seller and the buyer in the form of a specific code. Blockchains, which offer smart contract support, provide efficient and censorship-resistant solutions for dApp developers.\n\nThe list of such blockchains includes [*Ethereum (ETH)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/eth/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo)*,* [*Binance Smart Chain (BSC)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/bsc/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo)*,* [*Polygon (previously Matic Network, MATIC)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/matic/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo)*,* [*Tron (TRX)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/trx/)*,* [*Near (NEAR)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/near/)*,* [*Solana (SOL)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/sol/)*,* etc.\n\n[Full article](https://getblock.io/blog/what-is-a-dapp-everything-you-need-to-know-about-dapps/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q0fg2ar82n191.png?width=735&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f295f4d6518962a230dde85f2064aacc65d181",
