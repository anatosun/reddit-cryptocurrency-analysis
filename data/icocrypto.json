In order for utility tokens to function we would need to separate price volatility from utility. Thats why https://marketprotocol.io/ will be an essential part of the crypto ecosystem, because a company or a business owner could hedge the price of a coin to be able to actually consume the utility.\n\nhttps://marketprotocol.io/ has a working product in beta, credible team, hard working devs with very active github, real world use case with established partnerships for multi faceted integration of product, fast adoption for business to business, a products that will sustain longterm and elevate crypto to the next level.\n\nThe derivatives market is bigger then even the stockmarket, and MARKET Protocol will make allies with every project.",

Today, centrist PRI commands, yet again, both 128-members Senate and 500-members Chamber of Deputies with, respectively, 205 and 56 deputies. Another two leading parliamentary parties are PAN and left-wing, Marxist Labor Party.\n\nMexico has the World's six largest electronics industry and produces the most cars in the region of North America. Mexican developed economy provides plenty of market opportunities to startup entrepreneurs in many high-tech sectors. At the same time, high taxes, cumbersome administrative and legal barriers to SME as well as increasing brain-drain have reduced the growth potentials of the local startup ecosystem.\n\nIn Mexico cryptocurrencies are recognized as means of payment and transmission of value, without being a legal tender. Currently, there is no cryptocurrencies control regulation. Meanwhile, in May 2017, there had been a bill introduced to Mexican congress. It describes Bitcoin as a digital asset and suggests rules for local crypto-exchanges. This bill has since passed several review stages and is yet to be voted by senators.\n\nBusiness Notes for Startups Founders:\n\npolitical climate: indifferent;\neconomic climate: marginally friendly;\nregions to focus: locally, USA;\nindustries to focus: many;\nmajor limitations: slowing economy (GDP growth rate has fallen from 4% in 2015 to 1% in 2017), fixed Internet penetration rate is under 50%, mid-income consumers (per-capita at $9000), high taxes, legal and administrative barriers;\nstimulus: large population of 120 million, developed electronics industry (30% of export, exceeds $100 billion);\nopportunities: to create an e-business aimed at growing generation of young users of mobile Internet in FinTech sector;\nCryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): legal (positive).\n\nfor more: https://medium.com/@svjatoslavsedov/startups-and-bitcoins-in-mexico-82936b69484f",

            "text": "Looking back on the last couple of years, it was a wild rollercoaster ride for crypto. 2017 saw a hyperbolic rise in price, only for 2018 to strip the majority of the crypto markets\u2019 newfound value away. It was detrimental to some and many people got shaken out.However, for the people still involved, if Bitcoin\u2019s and crypto\u2019s history has taught us anything, it\u2019s that market cycles happen; when prices boom, they soon bust \u2014 and then it\u2019s rinse and repeat. Now that 2019 is upon us, everyone is speculating and predicting what the year ahead will hold for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.One of the more notable opinions on the matter comes from an article published by **Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings**, the famous risk-evaluation firm that\u2019s delved into the world of crypto.According to Weiss, 2018 was a disastrous year for cryptocurrencies, but only in terms of price action. With regards to the technology, the team at Weiss believes it was a year of major progress.\n\n## Looking Ahead to 2019\n\nIn the Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings 2019 forecast, the firm based their predictions and forecasts off 2 models.The first is a cycles model that helps estimate the timing of major market trends. The second is a model that identifies cryptocurrencies with the strongest combination of risk, reward, technology, and adoption.Each model is compiled by 10s of thousands of data points that are analyzed weekly. Using these models, the team at Weiss came up with 7 different forecasts for 2019 and beyond.\n\n### Forecast #1\n\n>**Bitcoin will be increasingly used as a store of value.**\n\nAccording to the Weiss team of analysts, Bitcoin makes for a great store of value and is well on its way to becoming a veritable digital gold.They believe this for a number of reasons, including that Bitcoin is extremely efficient to transport, it costs virtually nothing to store, it\u2019s secure, and it cannot be confiscated by any government.As well, there is currently no other cryptocurrency or other kinds of assets in the world that have these same properties as well as Bitcoin does.\n\n### Forecast #2\n\n>**The price of Bitcoin will rise again and head for new all-time highs.**\n\nBased on their model of timing major market trends, data analysts at Weiss believe Bitcoin will rise up and head for new all-time highs in 2019 and beyond. They said that most of the weak hands have already departed in 2018, and overall, the groundwork has been laid for a new bull market.\n\n### Forecast #3\n\n>**Select altcoins will rise from relative obscurity to as much as 20 times their previous all-time highs.**\n\nWeiss analysts predict that only a select few altcoins will rise to the top and even surpass their 2017-2018 peaks. They believe these coins will have superior technology to that of most, leaving the rest behind while they see substantial gains.\n\n### Forecast #4\n\n>**A select group of cryptos will compete to build a new kind of internet.**\n\nWeiss Cryptocurrency Ratings believe that coins like **EOS (EOS)**, **Cardano (ADA)**, and **Holochain (HOT)** are leading the way to create the Internet 3.0, which is a more secure, stable, and sustainable worldwide web.They also believe there will be others competing that haven\u2019t even joined the market yet. We should expect to see new coins emerge in 2019, one of which could one day have over a $1 trillion market cap if they succeed at creating the internet 3.0.\n\n### Forecast #5\n\n>**Another select group of cryptocurrencies will disrupt the world of banking.**\n\nAn unpopular opinion among Bitcoin maximalists, but one that\u2019s shared among Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings analysts, is that Ripple\u2019s XRP, Stellar, or some other coin will become the new kind of digital payment network.The analysts believe the coins mentioned here have more potential to disrupt financial markets, remittances, wire transfers, and more.\n\n### Forecast #6\n\n>**Bitcoin me-too coins will fade away.**\n\nWeiss analysts said that many coins will disappear going into 2019 and beyond. One of the types of coins that may not have a future are cryptos that don\u2019t offer anything new compared to Bitcoin.Such cryptocurrencies whose use cases are not innovative enough to distinguish them in the market will eventually **die off**.\n\n### Forecast #7\n\n>**New coins will rocket to the top 10.**\n\nWeiss analysts believe that new coins like Holochain or Hedera Hashgraph and others have the potential to rise quickly to the top 10 by market cap. These 2 projects utilize non-blockchain distributed ledger technology and analysts believe they will take a vast majority of market share away from other projects.SOURCE: [https://weisscryptocurrencyratings.com/news/crypto-forecasts-2019-beyond-1759](https://weisscryptocurrencyratings.com/news/crypto-forecasts-2019-beyond-1759)Join ICO DOG, Community-Driven - Discussions, Education & InvestmentsICO DOG, Reviews, Analysis and Advisory Services for ICO\\`s, STO\\`s, Cryptocurrencies & Blockchain Solutions[www.icodog.io](https://www.icodog.io/)",

However, unlike cryptocurrencies, CryptoBitcoin are crypto-collectibles that are yours to play with, raise and showcase to your friends!\nEach and every cryptobitcoin is unique and cannot be owned by anybody else than you as it is stored on independent blockchain.\n\nHow is it implemented?\nThe game app will be run via a set of a few Ethereum  smartcontracts.\n21 million (just like real Bitcoin has) unique collectible CryptoBitcoins with proof of ownership will be stored on the Ethereum blockchain.\nNo two are exactly alike, and each one of them can be officially owned only by one person on the Ethereum blockchain.\nCrypto-Collectibles Are The Next Big Thing. ERC-721 tokens that CryptoBitcoins are based on have huge potential in the realm of digital collectibles and online games.\nIndeed, CryptoBitcoins are just one of the first among countless digitized assets that will become collectibles facilitated and transacted through the Ethereum blockchain.\n CryptoBitcoins are digital images of Bitcoins that live purely on the Ethereum blockchain. They are collectibles that you can buy, sell, and best of all, mint to create new CryptoBitcoins. When you own a CryptoBitcoin, no one can take it away from you since your Ethereum address owns it and only you have the private key.\nStay confident knowing  that blockchain will track ownership of your cryptobitcoins securely.\n\nWhat is on offer?\nCryptoBitcoins, unique collectible decentralised non-fungible tokens are planned to be traded on internal marketplace for Ethereum (ETH) and used to generate (mint) more CryptoBitcoins.\nWhy should I buy CryptoBitcoins during pre-ICO and not after the game official launch? Simple - you will have more cryptobitcoins to use in the game.\nWe plan to use the proceeds from the ICO to create the game and run a marketing campaign to sign up more players.\nThis could create extra liquidity and value for your CryptoBitcoins on the internal marketplace.\n\n\nWhat is the benefit for early participants?\n\nOnly a small number of CryptoBitcoins will be distributed during pre-ICO with a generous discount to raise funds for the development and distribution of the game.\nDuring Pre-ICO, CryptoBitcoins will be priced at 0.01 ETH per 1 CryptoBitcoin. That is set to rise to 0.025ETH/1 CryptoBitcoin during ICO. Thus you save 60% if you buy during Pre-ICO. When the marketplace for minting and trading CryptoBitcoin will be unrolled, you can use your CryptoBitcoin to mint new valuable CryptoBitcoins  and offer them for sale to other collectors and investors. Being early investor secures you an early entry at a heavily discounted price. We expect significant interest from investors, gamers and collectors.\nOnly 21 million CryptoBitcoins will be ever minted, and only 1% is pre-minted.\nThere will be ever so much CryptoBitcoin in circulation as Bitcoin. This is done to eliminate inflation and protect the players vested interests.\nLimited series CryptoBitcoin has the same amount of coins in circulation like Bitcoin. Never will be anymore than 21million created, protecting CryptoBitcoins from inflation.\n1% (210,000 CryptoBitcoins) will be released for sale initially to cover for bounty campaign, marketing expenses and game development. 10 000 CryptoBitcoins are reserved to be released later as Epic CryptoBitcoins possessing turbo minting speed and rare alloys. The rest 99% is waiting to be minted by players who will rightfully own and enjoy this precious collection. This gives ample opportunity for CryptoBitcoiners to amass a bigger, richer collection of CryptoBitcoins.\n\nPREICO\nStarts___________________________28 feb 2018\nEnds____________________________31 mar 2018\nToken__________________________CryptoBitcoin\nPrice________________1 CryptoBitcoin = 0.01 ETH\nMinimum investment_________________0.02 ETH\nPlatform___________________________Ethereum\nAccepting_______________________________ETH\nSoft cap____________________________100 ETH\nHard cap____________________________500ETH\nCountry________________________Great Britain\nType of supply_________________________Fixed\nTotal supply__________21'000'000 CryptoBitcoins\nToken features_____________Collectible with PoS\nTechnology_________ERC-721 non-fungible token\n\nmore info on www.cryptobitcoin.io\n",

(For larger amount of bitcoin, HARDWARE WALLET is highly recommended) - Note: If you don\u2019t have ownership of your private keys, you don\u2019t own Bitcoin.\n3. Unless you trade very often, always withdraw your funds from exchanges and store them on offline wallets.\n4. Understand and respect the idea of bitcoin and the intended direction set out by the creator and developers.\n5. Take time to read news in full and assess if it is accurate and what it means, do not believe everything you read or hear.\n6. Never allow your emotions to dictate your decisions, always take time to consider decisions and remove panic/fear from them.\n7. Hold a diverse portfolio of cryptocurrencies to reduce risk. (need better suggestions: to be replace)\n8. Practice safe practices with passwords and private keys, do not ever share these with anyone under any circumstances. Give your cryptocurrency addresses instead. Always backup you wallet/private key and store it on multiple locations. (better if it is hand written)\n9. Always put secondary securities if available.\n10. Buy low, ~~sell high.~~ (Just buy on the dips and hold) HODL!",

Security and management of digital assets are two critical elements for all stakeholders within the burgeoning cryptosphere.\n\nTo fiat, digital currency is similar and alien at the same time. Both fiat and digital currency can be used to procure products, but digital currency is not yet commonplace and doesn\u2019t bank in a traditional sense. Digital currency uses encryption techniques to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.\n\nDecentralized digital currency transactions are faster and more secure than present day fiat transactions. Transactions that take days within the traditional banking system now take minutes or less on blockchain networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most recently, Tezos.\n\nVIAZ is a decentralized application (\u201cDAPP\u201d) bridging the gap between lenders and borrowers of fiat and digital currencies. VIAZ will employ VIAZ Smart Contracts for transactions initiated on the VIAZ Platform. Just as similarities and differences exist between digital and fiat currency, a closer examination of VIAZ compared to the traditional banking system reveals both converging and diverging characteristics. A notable similarity is that the VIAZ Platform, by putting potential borrowers in direct contact with potential lenders, empowers users to borrow, lend, and transfer currencies throughout a global network. But, unlike banks, the VIAZ Platform will provide a more efficient, cost effective and secure service for all users. The first DAPP to run on the Tezos blockchain, a self-amending crypto-ledger, the VIAZ Platform has inherent advantages when compared to other competitors in the bazaar.\n\nAs mentioned, the\u00a0 Platform is decentralized. Our aim is to make this market driven platform conducive for crypto and fiat loyalists alike. Billions of people globally do not have access to banks. The Platform provides them with an opportunity to take advantage of this global network of lenders and borrowers from the convenience of their own desktop computer or smartphone.\n\nA sound banking system mobilizes the small and scattered savings of the community and makes them available for investment in productive enterprises. The question of institutional accountability speaks directly to another promise of cryptocurrency. With its capacity for programmability, a blockchain can enforce smart financial contracts. Recently, and into the future, blockchain technology such as the Platform will solve issues of collateral management and guarantee compliance with capital requirements.\n\n \"#VIAZ https://viaz.io/\"\u00a0https://viaz.io/documents/Viaz-Whitepaper\\_EN.pdf  \n\n\nBounty0x username:\u00a0 alekseihurskiy\u00a0",

In order to establish the distribution of crypto currencies as a decentralized payment system, we feel that it is up to us to change this picture, being the first German company to promote the proliferation of crypto-ATM\u2019s and thus give everybody the opportunity to participate in such future-oriented payment options. \n\nAs can be seen in the graphic on the left, in Germany there is presently not a single public K-ATM (crypto ATM).

            "text": "Hi guys. I'm a community manager of an ICO ( MidasProtocol - sold out within mere 19 hours in July 1st). I have been involving in project since the beginning and i know a lot of interesting things about doing this job. What is the most common question you can easily find out in ICO Telegram Groups? \u201cWhen moon?\u201d \u2013 No; \u201cWhen lambo?\u201d \u2013 Of course not; Questions about whitepapers? Hell no! The most popular question is \u201cWhen exchange?\u201d\n\nThe psychology of almost contributors in the cryptomarket is to make return of capital and to get profit as quickly as possible. Especially after the spectacular pump of BTC and the explosion of mlm market at the end of 2017, a lot of people think that coins/tokens ICO, which are listed on exchanges will rapidly increase price and they will be profitable. They also believe that the listed coin/tokens are strong evidence to affirm that these projects are not scam or these coin/token are not unvaluable coin. Unfortunately, this thought is completely wrong. Coins/tokens can be easily listed on exchanges by some charges without considering what coin/token is it or how does it works ...\n\nPut yourself in position of a team that really is dedicated to their project and really has a passion, you may immediately understand that getting a token/coin listed on exchanges is not a simple matter, and it's really a costly progress. Accrording to [https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchanges-charging-up-to-3-million-to-list-tokens/](https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchanges-charging-up-to-3-million-to-list-tokens/), to list an ICO on a well known crypto exchange can cost anywhere between $ 1 - $ 3. million. The more reputable exchange you want to work with, the more fees you have to pay. Now we are trying to think about the ICO that we have invested and calculate how much hardcap they have earned, then we easily know getting coin listed on exchanges take them what percentage of hardcap. Therefore, they have to explore all avenues before getting their coin/token listed.\n\nBesides, to avoid rigging market and coin price manipulation, exchanges and project owners have to sign the NDA (Non-disclosure agreement). Therefore, they are not allowed to let out any information about the time that token/coin are listed on the exchange, though they definitely know that. Furthermore, considering the market condition is extremely important. There are a lot of ICOs got listed while the market was bleeding and there are many FUD, which induce the panic weak hands to sell their tokens hastily at cheap price, causing the token price to fall below ICO price. FUDs heap up together make more and more contributors lose their faith in project and certainly team have to spend a lot of effort to be able to rebuild the image also increase the value of the token.\n\nTo negotiate with exchanges, especially with the major exchanges is not that simple. You not only have to pay charges but also have to prove that your altcoin is potential and have to indicate its value and liquidity. It's too impracticable if you just create a new coin and rely on people estimating its value. The most successful altcoins have their specific and they are different from the other. They have their own feature that other coins don't have. In other words, you need to create some demand. Once you do it, the next step is to ensure that your coin is secure. Why we have to give some assurance that your coin is protected? - Because we have many bad cases. For example, there was a coin that made to insert malware into their base node client, got installed at an exchange and wiped them out of their holdings. So there is no doubt if your code will most likely should be open-sourced and audited.\n\nSo *Getting coins/tokens listed on exchanges \u2013 not that simple. This post is only my personal opinion :)*",

The company\u2019s origin as a software developer with commercial software systems sold to many G200 companies for searching and delivering direct answers to questions from live, unstructured text is a value when brought to the cryptocurrency field.\n___\nYet, there are other pressing problems with the blockchain technology that preclude its use as a vehicle for introducing Worldfree\u2019s proprietary natural language reasoning technology. Chiefly, the blockchain is not a scalable technology, and the consensus method of decisionmaking often touted as an advantage, is in fact a disadvantage, as the White Paper discusses. There are better, more just, rational and equitable methods for decision making.\n___\nThe cryptocurrencies themselves suffer from economically poor design in general. First among uses of currencies is as a medium of exchange. But as a consequence of their success, and early-stage design, today\u2019s currencies are massively deflationary, if not generally unstable. As they rise in price (as if successful equities), their purchasing power likewise increases. This is seemingly good for owners, and encourages holding cryptocurrencies, but not spending them.\n___\nThe crypto-economic world is thus stifled. Just as modern central bankers make great efforts to avoid deflationary environments because they stunt economies, a cryptocurrency must be designed to be a more functional alternative than fiat currencies, so that daily use for buying and selling other items is encouraged as a practical alternative currency for normal business needs. \n___\n**The secure FreeMark is a medium of exchange engineered to preserve the purchasing power of your wealth. Unlike other currencies, it is backed by real assets. As the money supply grows, you earn royalties for owning the FreeMark.**\n___\n\nWorldfree\u2019s FreeMark is a new cryptocurrency to be introduced in 2018 that will eventually have 100% backing, automatically pegged by the Atomic Central Bank \u00ae to a basket of 20 commodities. It can be immediately converted into most other currencies or used to purchase goods and services on the Worldfree Network. Holding it should deliver an increase in ownership on an average balance, correlated to the positive growth of the money supply. Thus it works contrary to normal fiat currencies, where increases in money supply reduce value; with the FreeMark they receive more of them at the same value. Existing cryptocurrencies are often unstable over short periods, massively inflationary or deflationary.\n___\n\n- Necessary for a sound and expansive crypto-economy, a stable currency, pegged to a basket of 20 commodities (to the 12-month moving average) eliminates the volatility of government and crypto fiat currencies.\n- The FreeMark is built upon a better model of transactions than just the blockchain. The Nodechain uses \"ownership\" as the basis of its data structure, while immutable blockchains store transactions independently and privately for each owner, keeping their data off public networks, even though it is encrypted.\n- The FreeMark is not a fiat currency. Government or Cryptofiat currencies like Bitcoin have no intrinsic value. It and other stable coins have taken the worst aspect of government currencies and copied it in the digital world. There are no physical or productive assets backing them, unlike the FreeMark, where 65% of revenues from sales go into an audited, regulated fund.\n- To be adopted by mainstream users, a crypto currency must give them an incentive to switch. The patent-pending Growth Rate Royalty automatically pays owners greater returns the earlier they buy. These returns are paid in FreeMarks based upon your average monthly balance. During the first year, the royalty rate is 7.5% times the growth rate of the FreeMark money supply (not 7.5% interest). Because growth rates are higher in the beginning, earlier owners are paid more.\n___\n[Hackernoon Article](https://hackernoon.com/blockchains-dont-scale-not-today-at-least-but-there-s-hope-2cb43946551a)\n___\nWorldfree also introduces Nodechain technology, which is different than a blockchain because it does not store transactions system-wide. It operates in a massively parallel architecture, and data file sizes per node are anticipated at less than 1Mb, with a 50X redundancy factor, irrespective of the network\u2019s size. Transactions on the Nodechain network can be processed predominantly on the participating parties\u2019 systems, with an effectively randomly-selected node updating the coin ownership, accessed through a function of a hash pointer. The patent-pending Nodechain still fulfils the design requirements to eliminate double spending, with greater security and better privacy, overcomes the limitations of the consensus paradigm, and processes transactions in seconds for each participant, irrespective of network size. It is distributed with redundancy, using extent-based parallel access. \n___\n**The Worldfree Network utilizes a cryptocurrency foundation engineered for prime-time and mass adoption, with a better designed economic and technological foundation.**\n___\n\n[Whitepaper](https://www.worldfree.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/WhitePaper-05-018.pdf) | [Business Whitepaper](https://www.worldfree.com/businesswhitepaper/) | [Lightpaper](https://www.worldfree.com/1-pglightpaper/) | [Valuepaper](https://www.worldfree.com/1-pgvalueupside/)\n\n___\n**The Worldfree Team**\nWorldfree has a global team with great experience in developing world-class application and network software and delivering it to G500 clients, as well as a group of experienced business advisors who have been invaluable in structuring and presenting our project, as well as providing future guidance.\n___\nWorldfree\u2019s team has designed and developed innovative new software products that were then sold, installed, enhanced and maintained for some of the world\u2019s leading companies. To do this implies being the best in a particular marketplace. Worldfree\u2019s management has thus already demonstrate that capacity, and now offers an entirely new, leading technology in the cryptocurrency space. This technological leadership is important for any person who owns FreeMarks.\n___\nWorldfree management\u2019s long history in the software field is the basis for a solid understanding of future directions, investor motivations and market forces\u2014facilitating better judgement and generally helping to make higher quality decisions for long-term capital allocation and planning. \n___\n[Kevin Kirchman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-a-p-kirchman/) | [Theodosis Mourouzis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theodosis-mourouzis-phd-8556a15/) | [Guillaume Goutaudier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaumegoutaudier/) | [Saskia van der Elst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/svdelst/)\n[Paul Kristensen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristensenpaul/)\n___\n[Simon Cocking](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-cocking-0540135/) | [Marius Lohri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariuslohri/) | [Glenn Bolger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glennbolger/)\n[Richard Berman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bermanpr/) | [George Tian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-george-tian-972b109b/)\n___\n**Join us to help make this new vision of a more robust and scalable digital currency platform a reality by learning about how these three amazing new technologies combine to fulfil the potential of the new world of cryptocurrencies.**",

Simply put, you buy 1 or 2 (maybe even 10!) ASIC Miners which should last you a few years and ElevateGroup manages it for you. Their mission is to be the most transparent and most profitable mining operation on the planet, and to give the investors a real opportunity to get involved in commercial Bitcoin Mining.\n\nThey have access to Electricity @ five and a half cents per KWH (5.5 cents)\n\nThey put your ASIC on a livestream 24/7 which allows you to see how it is performing, its earnings, its hashrate, everything.\n\nTwo experienced groups (Baikal Mining and Amir Ness) came together for this project. They own a 20 Million Dollar, 10 Megawatt facility in Russia right down the road from Bitmain Repair center. \n\n This is not their first BTC Mining operation, Baikal Mining is well seasoned in this field as is Amir Ness. They know that other profit sharing BTC Mining operations (Ambit Mining, Miner one, Ice Rock, etc.) take huge fees up front and don't mention a word about it, up to 35% of your investment before it ever sees contribution to the project.\n\nElevateGroup was established so that they could become the dominant Mining Service by offering the lowest fees that you can find on the market, 5%. This makes mining for YOU, up to 30% more profitable just by working with ElevateGroup.\n\nThey also launched without tokenizing the project, meaning no ICO. This means no ICO regulations to keep people from investing. \nThey do a straight investment-management agreement and give you profits from 80% of the pool per month. Most mining operations are giving you profits from 50% of the pool per month.\n\nThey saw an opportunity to make Mining more attractive by being aggressively competitive with their pricing. You won't find lower fees. Give them a look, its worth some due diligence. The Site has all the information you want:\n\nhttp://blockbot.info/official/\n\nAlso the Subreddit has good info and posts videos of the project frequently:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/ElevateGroup/\n\nHere is a video of the two founders, talking about their joint venture:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__w9uKW5JFE\n\n\n",

For me this is not a worthy ICO but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the same for you. Do your own research as usual. If you haven\u2019t heard about QuarkChain \\(QKC\\) by now\\(I doubt it!\\), it is yet another blockchain promising a very high throughput. The key difference of their blockchain compared to the already existing ones? QuarkChain adopts the *divide\\-and\\-conquer* idea to separate the two main functions in two layers with the goal of a better scalability while guaranteeing security.\n\nThe network thus has two layers of blockchains:\n\n* The Sharding layer \\(shard\\)\n\nThis layer contains an elastic number of blockchains \\(shards\\). Each shard processes a portion of all transactions independently. This process increases the system capacity. The [Casper Protocol](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/ethereum-casper/) being built for Ethereum to scale the network will be using [sharding](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#on-sharding-blockchains).\n\n* The Root Blockchain \\(rootchain\\)\n\nThe rootchain\u2019s responsibility is to confirm all blocks from sharded blockchains.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nTheir blockchain would supposedly be able to support cross\\-chain transactions since the transaction from another blockchain could be implemented by converting the tokens by an adapter. The QuarkChain Network should also be able to support smart contracts via Ethereum virtual Machine.\n\nThis is the big picture of the project, i\u2019ll let you go through the white paper if you want more information. I\u2019ll concentrate my efforts on the multiple red flags i\u2019ve encountered while trying to make sense of the project.\n\n## The Red Flags\n\n### Distribution\n\nYou can see the token distribution below. First, 2B QKC are available for investors. Participants of the private sale get 75&#37; of it with a 25&#37; bonus while ICO participants get 25&#37;. Classy. There is a slow release of tokens but only 7 months after the sale, private sale participants will have been able to dump all of their tokens. The mainnet is set to be released in Q4 2018\\(it will probably be later than that since most projects have difficulties respecting schedules\\) So private sale participants will probably have been able to sell their entire stack before the product is even released to the public. Makes perfect sense, right?\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThen the other 80&#37; of the total supply is, as we can see on the picture above, divided between the team, the foundation, the advisors, mining\\(Oh we need tokens to mine now?\\), community and marketing. I don\u2019t know about you but I think it\u2019s pretty vague and when I invest in a project I like to know where the money will go.\n\nAs mentioned before, the community will get some of the tokens. To be able to get in the ICO, it is kind of a lottery system where participants get a rating based on:\n\n* Timestamp of Telegram join date\n* Understanding of the project\n* Contribution to the project\n\nThe last part is a bit ridiculous because it creates an incentive for potential investors to portray the project only in a good light in order to maybe be able to get a piece of the pie.\n\nAlso, I think it\u2019s important to mention that Ian Balina participated in the private sale. I\u2019ll just leave it at that. He\u2019s in it for the technology, right?\n\n### Potential attacks on the network\n\nIn the whitepaper it is mentioned that the root chain has a significantly large portion\\(over 50&#37;\\) of hash power over the whole network. A malicious miner only needs 25&#37;\\(50&#37; \\* 50&#37;\\) of the hash power to perform an attack on the network. What if the hash power on the root chain is even lower? It seems like attacking this network would be way too easy. We have seen recent events of 51&#37; attacks on [Bitcoin Gold](https://qz.com/1287701/bitcoin-golds-51-attack-is-every-cryptocurrencys-nightmare-scenario/)and [Verge](https://www.ccn.com/privacy-coin-verge-succumbs-to-51-attack-again/). The number of different blockchains is going up at an alarming rate so the total available hash rate is spread around, making this kind of event even more likely for new projects. Blockchains just can\u2019t tolerate the fact that someone with 25&#37; of the hash rate can perform a malicious attack on the network.\n\n### GitHub and transactions per second (TPS)\n\nThey have a GitHub profile but it is private. Why would they do R&D, say that they have a good prototype but not show anything about it? In the whitepaper, they say the network will be able to do 100 000 TPS. Okay, and then on their website it is mentioned that for their latest testnet trial run they obtained a number of 2279 TPS. Where\u2019s the logic behind this? Investors have no way to know what they\u2019re investing in since the whitepaper is vague and the technology behind the project is not well explained.\n\n### Incentives\n\nThe token will be used as fuel for the network, like most blockchain platforms do.\n\nEven after reading the whitepaper, incentives to hold the tokens are not clear. Apparently, and I quote\n\n>*The essence of the virtual currency is the value carrier, which is the most important attribute of QKC.*\n\nHow can the main value of a brand new cryptocurrency be attributed to its ability to carry value?\n\nIn my previous article [How to Analyze ICOs](https://satoshi.blog/2018/03/22/how-to-analyze-ico/)\u00a0I mentioned I don\u2019t analyze a project in its entirety if there are too many red flags.\n\nI\u2019m out.",

EtherInc does this by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions. A bare-bones version of Namecoin can be written in two lines of code, and other protocols like currencies and reputation systems can be built in under twenty. Smart contracts, cryptographic \"boxes\" that contain value and only unlock it if certain conditions are met, can also be built on top of the platform, with vastly more power than that offered by Bitcoin scripting because of the added powers of Turing completeness, value-awareness, blockchain-awareness and state.\neinc.io ",

We can see its potential in a range of government departments and it will form a cornerstone technology platform as part of our commitment to drive forward innovation. It will improve the quality of life and enhance access to information for Maltese citizens. Blockchain technology is a key part of our national technology strategy that will see us transform different sectors.\"\n\nOmnitude first emerged as a new concept in blockchain ecosystems from an existing ecommerce agency. The company seeks to build further blockchain solutions that integrate both enterprise programs and supply chains.\n\nMalta's government had also approved a blockchain strategy earlier this year, making it one of the first countries in the world to incorporate a national strategy based on its technology.\n\nAside from working on improvements to the nation's transportation system, Omnitude is also partnering with Formula One to bring blockchain benefits to advanced racing and engineering projects.\n\nChris Painter, CEO and founder of Omnitude, explained, \"Governments around the world are beginning to see the potential for blockchain to reduce costs and streamline services. Malta has an extremely progressive government and we're excited about the potential this partnership brings. As a middleware technology, Omnitude's potential use\\-cases are vast and we look forward to working with the Maltese government to explore the capabilities of Omnitude's broad\\-based blockchain ecosystem.\"\n\nSince early March 2018, Malta has worked hard to establish itself as a Bitcoin hub. The country recently [welcomed Hong Kong\\-based Binance](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-23/the-world-s-biggest-cryptocurrency-exchange-is-moving-to-malta) to the region, where it is now establishing newfound residency following regulatory scrutiny in Asia. At only a year old, Binance is one of the largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.\n\nWeeks later, it was announced that Japanese [trading exchange OKEx](https://support.okex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002598072-OKEx-Is-Expanding-To-Malta-Given-Country-s-Comprehensive-Blockchain-Initiatives) and blockchain\\-based [equity fundraising platform Neufund](https://venturebeat.com/2018/04/17/berlins-neufund-wants-to-help-turn-malta-into-blockchain-island/) were opening offices within the island's borders.\n\nMalta further cemented its reputation as a blockchain fan by proposing [three new cryptocurrency bills](http://www.mondaq.com/x/696110/fin+tech/Maltese+Government+Presents+DLT+And+Cryptocurrency+Bills+To+Parliament+For+Approval) , including the Malta Digital Innovation Authority Bill to focus further on governance arrangements and oversee the legality of distributed ledger technology \\(DLT\\) platforms; the Technology Arrangements and Services Bill, which requires technology service providers to undergo a registration process; and the Virtual Financial Assets Bill, which seeks to regulate initial coin offerings \\(ICOs\\).",

Anyways I copied and pasted article word for word\n\n**Looking to put your money to work for you with some promising investments into Initial Coin Offerings? Here are three ICOs launching in 2018 that could help you do just that.**\n\n### ORIGIN\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThe first Initial Coin Offering you will want to pay close attention to is Origin.\n\nOrigin is a protocol which utilizes the Ethereum blockchain and IPFS for the creation of sharing\\-economy marketplaces. In essence, it affords both developers and businesses the ability to construct decentralized marketplaces on the blockchain, while making it simple to both create and manage listings for the fractional usage of services and assets.\n\nOrigin lets buyers and sellers find each other with ease, while also allowing for the browsing of listings and making of bookings. Both buyers and sellers may also leave ratings and reviews \u2014 but that\u2019s just the start.\n\nTeams all over the world have already begun to build on the project\u2019s protocols, but if you\u2019re looking to conduct business on the decentralized web, this is one ICO you won\u2019t want to miss out on.\n\n### ORCHID\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nOrchid is a market based, fully decentralized, and anonymous peer\\-to\\-peer system based on \u201cbandwidth mining\u201d which to address the lack of relay and exit nodes currently plaguing the I2P and Tor space by directly incentivizing participants.\n\nAs described in the project\u2019s whitepaper, Orchid aims to construct \u201ca blockchain\\-based stochastic payment mechanism with transaction costs on the order of a packet, a commodity specification for the sale of bandwidth, a method for distributed inductive proofs in peer\\-to\\-peer systems which make Eclipse attacks arbitrarily difficult, an efficient security\\-hardened auction mechanism suited for the sale of bandwidth in circumstances where an attacker may alter their bid as part of an attack, and a fully distributed anonymous bandwidth market.\u201d\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, Orchid aims to make the Internet an open platform once more, on which human beings are free to learn and communicate in an unmonitored, uncontrolled, and uncensored environment. The project\u2019s goal is to construct \u201ca new civil contract around a distributed marketplace for computation, storage, and bandwidth to provide the framework for a new form of digital citizenship.\u201d\n\nIf that sounds appealing to you, don\u2019t miss out on Orchid\u2019s ICO.\n\n### OPTITOKEN\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThe last \u2013 and perhaps most promising \u2013 ICO to watch in 2018 is from [**OptiToken**](https://optitoken.io/).\n\n[**OptiToken**](http://bitcoinist.com/optitoken-adds-former-ishares-blackrock-consultant-team-solidifies-rank-top-ico-2018-candidate/)\u00a0is the first ever algorithmically traded hyper\\-deflationary cryptocurrency which\u00a0distributes value through an automated tokenized portfolio.\n\nThe project works thanks to a cleverly\\-curated and strategically diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies available through a single token \u2013 the OptiToken \u2013 which will be traded on many major exchanges.\n\nThe OptiToken provides exposure to a unique algorithm labeled \u201cOptiX\u201d which has consistently and transparently outpaced Bitcoin trading on a daily, and weekly basis since November 2017. The algorithm, which is now available on the projects GitHub, has been developed by highly\\-experienced traders and allows for the progressive integration of machine learning \u2014 meaning upward price pressure is going to be extreme and constant.\n\nImportantly also, a portion of the profits generated by the company are used to purchase OptiTokens each and every buy cycle, which provides a steady upward price pressure while ensuring value for adopters and investors. Furthermore, 100&#37; of those tokens purchased by the company are sent to an unspendable address \u2014 easily verifiable and transparent \u2014 to create a hyperdeflationary effect. In effect, OptiToken is the first ever actual hyperdeflationary money.\n\nYou\u2019d be hard\\-pressed to find a more exciting ICO in 2018 than that offered by\u00a0OptiToken. To learn more, check out the project\u2019s official website\u00a0",

The high-capacity system will solve the scalability problem that current main blockchains are facing.\n\nThis problem is so urgent that bitcoin community can't wait to reach an agreement. Different solutions compel the community to split through a controversial hard fork. (As a reference, Bitcoin blockchain only offers around 4 TPS.)\n\n###**What DApps will QuarkChain support?**\n\nQuarkChain welcomes various DApps, especially those demand high transaction rates: advertisement, IOT ( internet of things) , AI and big data, game, peer to peer sharing economy, etc. Today, lots of dApps are waiting for a more reliable and scale foundation to begin with, QuarkChain will become a perfect choice.\n\n\n###**What makes QuarkChain different?**\n\nOnly looking for a high TPS network is not a new story. Every year, well-known payment networks, e.g., Alipay, can reach 200K peak TPS. The challenge of this project is to obtain an extremely high TPS while maintain the network\u2019s decentralization and security at the same time. Scalability, decentralization, and security have very different conditions and requirements, many methods could not take care all of them. Our system increases throughput while maintaining decentralization and security.\n\n###**What is QuarkChain\u2019s relationship with DAG or Tangle technology**\n\nQuarkChain itself can be treated as a well-structured DAG: given two DAGs of QuarkChain, we could easily tell which one should be appended after thanks to QuarkChain\u2019s root chain. This allows QuarkChain to inherit a lot of benefits from both Bitcoin/Ethereum and general DAG technique. E.g., the consensus of QuarkChain and its threat model can be easily derived/analyzed following those of Bitcoin/Ethereum, while QuarkChain achieves high throughput similar to general DAG.\n\n\n**Just some of the exciting new advancements to crypto coming with QuarkChain.**\n\n**I would love to hear your opinions on the **tech**\n\n**Will you be investing in this crypto currency?**",

These criterion also apply to analyze ICO\u2019s, but when it comes to these, there are also a couple more specific things you should look into. For the sake of learning, let\u2019s see how to analyze an ICO, from A to Z. We\u2019ll thus revisit some principles mentioned in the article on altcoins.\n\n## Value proposition\n\nFirst things first:\u00a0in a nutshell, what is the value proposition of the project? Is it promising and does it have a future? What is the size of the potential market?\n\n## The technology\n\nLinked to the value proposition, we must also ask ourselves what is the technology of the project. Is it new? Is it simply a copy pasta of an already existing project?\n\n## Functional product\n\nIs there already some work done by the team? It may be a red flag if it\u2019s not the case. Have you ever seen entrepreneurs asking for funding with simply an idea and absolutely no work done on the project? This is the perfect recipe for a legendary failure.\n\n## Necessity of a token/source of income\n\nAs in the case of any particular altcoin, we must ask ourselves if the project really requires a token.\u00a0We have seen the emergence of several projects lately that do not require a token and even cases where the token represents a burden for the project. If so, it would obviously be ridiculous to invest in the project, especially in the case of an ICO.\n\nAlso, we should look into the profit generation model of the token. Some projects charge fees to users and redistribute it to token holders while some prefer to burn tokens to reduce the circulating supply. Possibilities are endless to redistribute to token holders but it is important to check if it\u2019s mentioned in the terms of the ICO and if it\u2019s realistic.\n\n## Competition\n\nAs in any other market, it is important to research the competitors to see where this ICO lies against already existing projects. In other words, evaluate if the project brings something new or if it\u2019s only a copy of other projects.\n\n## Team\n\nSome projects prefer to keep the team\u2019s identities undisclosed and in many cases this is a big red flag. Think about it for a second. Would you invest in a company in which you have no idea who\u2019s working behind? We have seen some projects performing really well and delivering on time even though we have no idea who\u2019s working behind but it is definitely a factor to take into account when researching and deciding whether to invest or not. This increases the risk a lot in the sense that the team can bail out with no consequence at all on their reputations.\n\nEven if the team is open about their identities, there is still some research to be done.\u00a0How many are they? Do they have experience in what they are trying to do? What is their history, in crypto and elsewhere? Have they been involved in shady events in the past? Do they have a history of success?\n\nDon\u2019t get caught up in a scammy ICO where the graphic designer is supposedly Ryan Gosling as seen below. This is the Miroskii ICO. The worst part of this story? They have still been able to raise more than $830 000 from innocent\\(stupid\\) investors!\n\n## Advisors\n\nJust as for the team, it is wise to review all the advisors. These people can bring a lot of expertise to the team and help them to move forward with their project in a more efficient way. For example, if [Vitalik Buterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin)\u00a0is featured as an advisor \\(and you verified that it\u2019s actually true\\) it is a great thing in the sense that he has a lot of experience to bring to the table.\n\n## Community\n\nContrarily as when researching any particular altcoin, communities backing an ICO are usually much smaller than for established projects. It is still a good idea to review the social medias, look at the number of followers, trying to see if those are real or fake. Also, there is definitely some things to learn by looking at some reviews of the ICO by prominent and knowledgeable people in the crypto sphere. Some things that a beginner could not see as a big flaw, for example.\n\n## GitHub activity\n\nIf the project is open source and there is some work done already, it is wise to review the GitHub to check the involvement on it and the speed of development.\n\n## White paper\n\nThe white paper is the document where everything about the project should be explained. In general, it is around 10 to 20 pages. It is very important to read it carefully, even if you don\u2019t understand everything, in order to really grasp what the project is about. The project has no white paper at the time of the ICO? That\u2019s another red flag\u2026\n\n## Terms of the crowdsale\n\nNow\u2019s time to look at the most interesting things. Even if everything else sounds great, this is where it could make or break. So wait a bit before investing all of your money and selling your wife and kids to buy even more of that ICO.\n\n### Quantity of tokens given to investors, founders and advisors \u2013 vesting\n\nFirst, we must understand that it is important for the team, the founders and the advisors to receive a piece of the pie. Indeed, incentive to perform and thus make more money for themselves is a good thing and it always has been this way. This is why stock options are still widely used in companies. That being said, this percentage should be reasonable enough so that investors can still make a good investment by buying tokens.\n\nOther usage of the tokens may include reserve for the future and for the use of the platform, for bounties,etc. In most cases, this is also important for the long term success of the project.\n\nAnother crucial aspect to look into regarding the crowdsale is the vesting period of the tokens i.e. when they can be moved after the crowdsale. Some projects simply have no vesting period, which means that directly after the crowdsale is done and the token is listed on an exchange, the team can dump all of its tokens. This means that they let the project die while laughing all the way to the bank. Doesn\u2019t sound like a great deal for investors, huh?\n\n### Capped or uncapped\n\nAnother important factor is whether the crowdsale is uncapped or capped. In the latter case, then at how much it is. The disadvantage of a capped sale is that it is harder to get tokens. Certain systems can be in place to avoid that most of the supply is bought by only a couple whales. For example, we have seen some ICOs where there was a maximum contribution per bitcoin or ethereum address.\n\nWhen it is uncapped, it means that the project can get as much money as investors are willing to give them, which means that there is no scarcity. We have seen a lot of projects with an uncapped crowdsale where as soon as it was listed on exchanges, tokens lost a lot of their value. This is easily understandable because all of the participants who wanted to get in were able to. Then the only people left in the market are those who want to sell, for whatever reason it may be.\n\n### Presale\n\nIt is important to look if other investors could get in before the ICO, and at which price. Most projects have a private unadvertised presale where investors can get cheaper tokens compared to the ICO price. Sometimes the presale price is so low that it\u2019s not worth it at all to get in the ICO. Indeed, because buyers in the presale got tokens so much cheaper, they will most likely sell at market price when the ICO is done and listed on exchanges.\n\n### Inflation\n\nIt is wise to try to understand the level of inflation the token has. If investors get, for example, 30&#37; of the supply during the ICO but that the annual inflation rate is also 30&#37; it kind of kills the vibe because there is no scarcity and the supply increases too fast.\n\nTo sum up, make sure to analyze ICO\u2019s thoroughly before you invest your hard\\-earned money. Many scams are still present in the crypto sphere but if you analyze everything carefully, you can almost be sure it\u2019s not a scam and that it\u2019s not another one of these shitty projects out there.\n\nHappy hunting!",

            "text": "**The banking sector is losing its reputation every year. Banks take clients\u2019 money at almost zero percent, with all the transactions and customer transfers they charge the commission. Studies Cambridge business school confirmed that the customers of banks increasingly began to move to new forms of payments, for reasons of their cheapness and on the fact that financial efficiency. Increasingly, people began using Bitcoin as a means for cross-border money transfers. However, Bitcoin has a number of problems, including transaction time, scalability and flexibility to create Smart contracts.**\n\n---\n\n*With the advent of the Internet, banks and other financial institutions are trying to catch up with the progress by introducing such functions as Internet banking, mobile payments, etc., but the rapidly growing wave of decentralization, which allows virtually free transfer of money and any media content, covers the banking system with a head.\nOne example is accounting fin. institutions. Central registers store all registers and records of all transactions. The method is not bad, but very weak before hackers, the results of hacking which we observe from time to time.\nIn a decentralized system, an act of hacking is impossible, because there are no intermediaries in the distributed accounting system, but there is one distributed register that is updated throughout the system as transactions are completed. The blockchain is a technology of the future that distributes certified and auditable access to data, and is not available to banks, as they are like huge elephants, cannot keep up with progress.*\n\n---\n\n>All this shows all the existing potential for a rapid economic boom, in the sphere of the crypto economy. However, there are also problems, among them, there was a sharp ignorance of all people about the existence of technologies for transferring money in a more economical way, rather than through banks. Just as acute is the problem of the unresolved normative bases written specifically for the crypto market, and if somewhere the preparation of a package of such standards has been started, then it is at an embryonic level. Because most owners of crypto purses remain incognito.\nMosaics of the crypto economy already exist in a disjointed form, but they still have to be linked into one ecosystem. At the moment, the market situation is characterized by the project as CRYPTO ECONOMY 1.0.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n**Korona Coin** is a European crypto token designed for real, wide, everyday use for the purchase of goods and services. It will be supported by a new, efficient transmission technology and a complex ecosystem that includes a wide range of banking and commercial services. Korona will establish the missing link between crypto-economics and the real-world economy. Ecosystem Korona will provide complex packages of banking services, which will be provided jointly to private and business customers. Users should be provided with easy-to-use, transparent and licensed platforms that meet their complex needs: including wallet management, fast and inexpensive payment technology, and file sharing. In addition, Korona will provide its users with support for such services as information support for taxation, customer protection, commercial guarantees, as well as support for marketing and market access. The Korona platform will also create a special Korona market, offering a wide range of products and services for online shopping or in real stores. When choosing products, customers will be able to use the international price comparison system. For users, Korona will provide valuable financial benefits in the form of costs and price reductions, but also in the form of reward tokens. These functions should make the markers of Korona widely recognized and valued. A new and far-reaching marginal economy will be created once local and regional trade and marketing activities are supported.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Why Blockchain?**\n\n> In the current Blockchain, payment systems can be profitable mainly for investors. Transactions bring real revenue, only exceeding a certain number of tokens. Instant payments cannot be made, fast transactions are expensive. The new Coin Korona will make it possible to extract the greatest benefit and benefit from the cryptocurrency.\n\n* The system of rewards will allow you to receive coins, providing a personal referral link.\n* The mobile wallet is available at any time thanks to the application.\n* Corporate wallet provides transparency for state institutions.\n* Korona API is specially designed for smooth and secure payments.\n* Cryptobank Korona provides certified support for the commercial activities of registered companies.\n* The marketing program for companies and suppliers.\n* Instant payment with Raiden Network technology.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n> In turn, Korona Ecosystem is a full-fledged network of various applications and tools that support private and business users in exploiting the benefits provided by cryptocurrency payment methods.\n\n**The main components of Ecosystem:**\n\n* Introduction of the newest technology of electronic payments;\n* Payment of transactions in the network;\n* Rational choice of goods and markets;\n* Payment by the Crown in stores;\n* Currency exchange;\n* Comprehensive packages of services;\n* Corporate wallets;\n* Integrated marketing support;\n* Aligning short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate;\n* Reduced prices for users.\n\n\n---\n\n**Korona Token is a general-purpose token that allows you to conduct a wide range of debugged transactions, which also performs the function of a service for the exchange and storage of valuables.

            "text": "\nToday, economic inequality between people is very pronounced. This is why Wealth Migrate was founded\u200a\u2014\u200athe online real estate market. Today we will try to understand what Wealth Migrate represents, what problems it solves and what positive qualities it\u00a0brings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWealth Migrate began its history with the first platform in 2013. They conducted more than 1,700 transactions on the basis of the block, where investors from 46 countries took part, and their total investment in real estate amounted to 392 million dollars. By 2016, the platform has increased to participants from 111 countries, and the Wealth Migrate platform itself has become one of the world\u2019s leading Finteh-Top-50 platforms. In addition, Wealth Migrate was the world\u2019s first global platform using block technology and smart contracts. The team of founders have a large track record on the international real estate space, on 5 continents with a total investment value of over 1.34 billion US dollars. Therefore, combining all their experience and modern technology, they created the global ecosystem of Wealth Migrate. The team of specialists overcame a large number of legal issues that appeared as barriers to the creation of Wealth Migrate.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to the investment platform Wealth Migrate, investors from all over the world will have access to exclusive real estate, and will also be able to avoid inefficient costs that are inherent in traditional real estate transactions. And this is achieved by automating the process, which allows to accelerate the growth of high incomes of the investor, creating safe and economically stable diversified portfolios. Thus, Wealth Migrate develops within the framework of three core values: transparency, trust and most important alignment of interests.\n\n\nWithin the next five years, Wealth Migrate plans to continue developing its platform so that investors at the international level can invest in the real estate market in a qualitative and safe manner. The goal of Wealth Migrate is to achieve one million transactions per year, with an average of $ 2,000 per operation. And also Wealth Migrate plans to expand its University of Wealth to provide analytics and portfolio management for investors. As Nelson Mandela said: \u201cEducation is the most powerful weapon that you can use to change the world.\u201d\n\n\nBy creating our WealthE token, Wealth Migrate can provide a number of advantages for the owners of these tokens, they can be used as electronic assets based on real estate. Therefore, when investors register on an online platform, they will necessarily have to provide KYC and AML documents. After that they will be able to replenish their wallet (including bitcoin) without problems and start investing from 1000 US dollars and above. The minimum amount of investments will allow to diversify the portfolio of assets\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nWealth Migrate\u200a\u2014\u200aseeks to create a market that will provide open access around the world to real estate, at affordable prices (starting at $ 1,000). Not many people know, but land and real estate are one of the most reliable areas where you can save your money, as well as multiply them. About 49% of the total wealth of the world accounts for real estate, which is more than two hundred trillion US dollars. Any farmer in China, a shepherd in Africa or an investment banker in New York, understands the essence and value of real estate, no matter whether they have access to it or not. Based on the existing problems, Wealth Migrate, adopted a solution that will once and for all eliminate all barriers and restrictions existing in this market. After all, the problem is really great, because only a small part of the world has access to real estate, only 12.9% of the world\u2019s population, and according to Western statistics these 12.9% are rich by age 65 will retire less than 1%.\nIn the world there is a huge gap in wealth. To resolve the current situation, Wealth Migrate plans a step-by-step approach to eliminating and reducing the gap in wealth.\n\nIt was necessary to create and prove the uniqueness of the Wealth Migrate model, which will use the Blochynch technology in its work.\n\nIssue a digital token that will expand the Wealth Migrate business, and increase its influence and reduce the entrance to the real world of real estate. This phase will begin with the start of the sale of WealthE tokens (the first quarter of 2018).\n\nExpanding the capabilities of Wealth Migrate, through various platforms and regions, will allow billions of people to gain access to owning real estate in a new and developing market.\n\n\n---\n\nhttps://wealthe.io/ https://www.facebook.com/wealthmigrate/ https://twitter.com/WealthE_Coin https://wealthe.io/whitepaper.pdf\nhttps://bountyhive.io/join/WealthMigrate\n@WealthE_Coin #WealthE_Coin",

EtherInc does this by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions. A bare-bones version of Namecoin can be written in two lines of code, and other protocols like currencies and reputation systems can be built in under twenty. Smart contracts, cryptographic \"boxes\" that contain value and only unlock it if certain conditions are met, can also be built on top of the platform, with vastly more power than that offered by Bitcoin scripting because of the added powers of Turing completeness, value-awareness, blockchain-awareness and state.\n\nhttps://einc.io",

I'll start:\n\n1. Shopin (https://tokensale.shopin.com/)- Shopin's team is just awesome and very well-established. I believe this WILL be the Amazon of the cryptoworld.\n\n2. ZeroEdge (https://zerocoin.bet/)- I am not sure who first came up with the zero-house model for casinos, but I really like the idea and think it is the future of casino games (as a gambler it just sounds so awesome and fair). I am going with ZeroEdge since I like their model and they seem fairly promising as an organization.\n\n3. Bitcar (https://bitcar.io/)- These guys are at the final stage of releasing THE token for buy the bitcoin lambo everyone is hoping for ^^. Super promising project as well, I think they will get way more investors than they initially set out to.\n\nSo what are your picks for the best ICO this summer?",

Cryptocurrency fans are, by their very definition, technologically astute, but not all would-be traders share their technical acumen.\n\n\nNow a new startup aims to remove some of those barriers to entry, smoothing the playing field and making it easier for would-be traders to get in the game. That new startup is called Signals, and CTO Pavel Volek put its mission this way...\n\nMore info [Signals Network ICO](https://signals.network/join/F7EF78)",

Hoard, the One and Only project setting you up to be your own bank**!\n\n## Introducing\n\n\n\n|[Web page](https://www.hoardinvest.com/)|[White Paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.hoardinvest.com/public/docs/Hoard+Whitepaper+Draft+v1.3.pdf)| [Team](https://www.hoardinvest.com/about/)  |\n|:------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe name of this little post is **\u201cClash of Titans\u201d** and that's simply because we will have two big players in the field of cryptocurrency banking, where each of these two giants will trying to demonstrate their vision and make you be able to use your Crypto in a daily life.\n\nOne of these two Ambassadors of crypto banking will be definitively ETHOS. ETHOS was the very first project where I have been convinced that their goal is to improve whole paying system and basically to build one. Their ICO was very successful, they obtain decent support from the medial world, their community is strong and the main fact is, their team is awesome.\n\nThey have one young genius named Shingo Lavigne as a CEO and great strategies and visionary Mr. Stephen Corliss who has got a lot of experiences and connections to grant the opened door leading up to the institutional sphere for Ethos.\nWho was in ICO, made a decent amount of money. Everybody thought that has to be a true champion without any possible competition.\n\nWhen I heard about the Hoard for the first time, it was like when you get struck by the lightning. And hit by a truck right after! I immediately download their WP right to my phone and started to read it. I have to read it twice (you know, good stuff...well written, but lightning...truck...these can mess up your day completely). I have known right from a spot that I was reading about a true gem. I get Inspired. I wanted to know more and the baseline which started all of this was: \nThey are like Ethos but slightly better!\n\nThere is a man in Hoard Invest who is very good at making things done. His name is **Jason Davis** and he is a new Rockstar in the cryptocurrency Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He will bring a whole new concept to the world of the banking industry. He will create a special kind of bank without a possibility to provide loans. Hoard will partner\nwith some banks to provide a real bank account with all the basic stuff in a little while.\n\nMr. JD has a tremendous experience in banking systems and also in application design and development. He has learned what struggles a new customer has to overcome and that's because he was a new customer once too. \nHe is able to assemble those two things together and create ripper breakthrough product. The last piece of this puzzle is **Mr. Dan Lipert**, an expert who can code everything\nDon't get confused! This \"ZZ Top look\" guy has got very high expertise rating in coding stuff and if He looks like Jazzy Hipster, his ability to write a code is like when you are watching Eddie Van Halen play his Eruption solo. The movie Hacker with Hugh Jackman has been written by his CV btw and since he was working for the government of US as an IT expert, he has to know the drill.\nThe team like this has a decent power to attract and create powerful alliances.\n\n\nI choose to write about Hoard Invest because everything about it makes sense to me. This is where crypto needs to go for adopting. **Only with projects like Hoard will the world start to take cryptocurrencies seriously**. \n>The world will start taking crypto seriously if there will be a real use for that...like \u201cLet's use it as a money\u201d! (JD)\n\n\n                                  Someone sings to Shingo drone, \n                                Someone hails from Jayson\u2019s throne.\n\n********************************************************\n# The Hoard ecosystem\n\nLet me tell you about another ecosystem which will make a huge impact on the future world, let me tell you about the possibility to be your very own bank, let me tell you about a team which is good as a hack and about their application modern design of which is fucking sick!\n\nThe Hoard is an **ecosystem** build on very good foundations. In this ecosystem, you will be using the **hybrid multifunctional wallet** where you can store all your coins and if this is not a game changer for you right now \nmaybe I will change your opinion by adding another game-changing and astonishing tool, the **Fiat gateway**. \nThat's right!\n\nUnless you are not one of the most demanding readers and you are already convinced to buy their stuff, here you have\na link https://www.hoardinvest.com/token/ and take care, but if you like it in more hardcore motion like I do, \nlet's continue with some special perks list reading, shall we? :)\n\nBy implementing FIAT gateway they successfully put away any need for logging into an exchange. So you don't have to buy BTC or ETH (and pay the fee) for your EUR/USD, then send them on Binance/Bitrex (and pay the fee), purchase\na Litecoin (for a fee) and then make a final payment with some fee (well fu*ck me, that's a lot of fees). \nWe got to used to it.\n\nAnother ripper they can provide you with is the system of Instant payments. You just click on the button \u201cspend\u201d \nand sell whatever coin you have at the moment and you will instantly get a value in dollars which you can use for your morning coffee purchase. That is really important because you can pay for whatever you just have right now. \nWhat suit your needs better. If you have only Neo and you want to pay with Neo, but your shop receives only Litecoin and Bitcoin, you have to go on the exchange and consolidate it, make a transaction, do a market, spend some time, \npay the fees. Not anymore with Hoard. Another thing is they want to create 1:1 peer to peer relationship in transactions (you send One BTC, the guy will receive one whole BTC, not 0,98). So we have an Ethos on steroids here but what is their vision? I think the basic idea is to make a highway for completely new users in the sphere of the crypto world and clear\na path for them completely; no obstacles if possible. You are also a **Master of your private keys and passwords**. Hoard can hold them for you if you like (in a way of provided service/support as encrypted backup).\n\nYou can be your own bank. Hoard is not a bank in the classical way of thinking.\n **The mission isn't to work for as many banks as possible but make the banks want to work with HOARD**. \n\nUsing Hoard means = **Technology+security+support  and almost Zero fees**\n\nYou can also **Invest** your crypto profits right from the App and then forget about it for a while and let your money grow. This is first very first ICO available in the US and bears witness to this historical moment, when 3-8 % of world economic lays peacefully in the arm of cryptocurrencies and do this all from your smart device,\nwith a help of the elegant and well-written application.\n\n\n\n                               Someone in hoard with shiny might,\n                             Someone is alone, in the endless night.\n\n***************************************************************************\n# What can Hoard offer to you\n\n1) Cross-chain transactions and inter-exchange price matching\n2) Instant transactions with Masternodes and minable transactions for scalability\n3) Dapps on the Smaug network and possible ICO hosting. Airdrops to token holders each ICO\n4) Public or Private transactions\n5) The decentralized exchange where you always control your private key never the exchange\n6) Fiat Gateway with the first fully compliant US-based ICO\n7) Multi-currency wallet where Hoard never holds your private keys\n8) Merchant services \u2014 send and receive payments in any currency including fiat regardless of initial currency type\n9) Low transaction and other fees. Fees will be very low and allow you to do microtransactions for zero or almost zero fees\n10) Sidechain for instant low fee transactions (think the lightning network and plasma) with multiple layered blockchain\n11) Portfolio tracking\n12) INV Fintech partnering\n13)  Self-auditing process via Oracles\n14) Two possible levels of KYC authentication \n15) You have all needed tools to be your Own bank\n16) Strong community\n\n\n\n                                Someone tried to get that throne,\n                             He shall be doomed with crown of thorns.\n\n***********************************\n\n# Summary and Technical shortcut for advanced readers\n\n* **The basic idea is to make a highway for an experienced user and clear a path for him, no obstacles if possible**\n* **You are the master of your keys and passwords, Hoard can hold them for you if you like in a way of provided service/support (encrypted backup)** \n* **Direct communication with banks; the idea is banks should want to work with HOARD**\n* **Their contribution to blockchain is a second layer payment protocol (Raiden; it is off-Chain; it is cross-chain capable)**\n* **They want to create 1:1 peer to peer relationship in transactions (you send One NEO, the guy will receive ONE whole NEO)**\n* **HOARD = Technology+security+support**\n* **HOARD is not a  classic \"bank\"** \n* **The world will start taking crypto seriously if there will be a real use for that...like for money!**\n* **Important thing is that you can pay for whatever you have. If you have the only NEO and you want to pay with NEO, but your shop receives only Litecoin and Bitcoin, you have to go on the exchange and consolidate it, make a transaction, do a market, spend some time, pay fees.**\n* **Hoard has got an instant payment system, so you click button spend and sell whatever the fuck you have and you will have dollars**\n* **If you try to screw our network, they will take your  value(basically PoS for exchanges)**\n* **By running Master node you can store your keys on our own system when doing trading with our platform; never keep your keys on an exchange.**\n* **They will have well know customers and unknown customers (true decentralization)**\n* **So it is basically a side chain with PoS in OAR**\n* **MM, Oracle(transparent auditing system), low fees, micro/instant transaction,\nsupport -> you want this**\n* **The Hoard is an ecosystem**\n* **Banks are in use of the BlockChain for 6 years already**\n* **Providing a trusted and secure bridge between the fiat money and cryptocurrency environments -FINRA/MSB regulated and KYC/AML compliant**\n* **2nd-layer cross-chain payments protocol for everyday use, serving as a valuable utility reinforced by our native currency from day one**\n* **OAR can be used to accelerate the conversion of fiat-to-crypto when buying cryptocurrency and crypto-to-fiat when cashing out or as a daily settlement mechanism for merchants. OAR enables holders to atomically transact - spend using (X) or (X + Y) currency while the recipient receives (Z) currency, instantly**\n* **OAR is ERC20 token running on Ethereum platform. They will migrate to  their own chain in the future**\n* **They are opposite of Ripple**\n\n\n\n\n****************************************************************************************\n\n\n\n* **Oracle** \nIt is a software for auditing.\nOracle sees everything, it knows what everyone has in their wallets on the platform.\nThey will monitor the blockchain and collect data and use that data to react...its kinda like AI. Setting a current value of the crypto you are hoarding.\nWill be open-source in the future.\n\n* **MasterNodes**\nThe master nodes have not yet been finalized.\nMaster nodes are things you can run on your own by holding tokens, stabilizing the token value and help the Hoard to run transaction easily. By running a master node you provide a help with building decentralization.\n\n* **Smaug protocol**\nInstant trustless payments across any currency or smart contract based blockchain. \nInstantly and automatically swap holdings at transaction versus manual coin consolidation. \nDecouple reliance on any specific chain, foundation or exchange.\n\n\n**********************************************\n\n# Decision making \n\n\nNow, let's get back to our comparison.\nMr. Corliss opens up the institutional side for ethos. He has deep connections from his time with BlackRock and knows how to give confidence and legitimacy to the ethos project. Having top talent like him attracts other top talents to join too. Shingo had a good idea. He cocked the rest of it up. Ideas like prediction or betting...   then who knows what.\nThey can still make it a good platform in the long run. \n\nMr. JD on the other hand, is so Fair dinkum and True blue developer/programmer/businessman/dealmaker/blockchain-evangelist/ and a great entrepreneur, because he understands the day to day problems in our own personal financial dealings and management systems, having a vast knowledge of blockchain technology he has come up with the solution we have all been waiting for. He is a solid unit. He made a tool to let us be our own bank and be less reliant on corporations who love to take your hard earned money and fee you to the death. If Roger Ver is Jesus of Bitcoin Cash, then JD is Chuck Norris of banking systems in the cryptocurrency world.\n\n\n\nEthos vs. Hoard. When it comes down to it, show that Ethos is offering two things. A fiat gateway for cryptocurrency investing and crowd sentiment for investing..(with Binance offering USD pairing soon ETHOS needs to step its game up). Hoard will be a fiat gateway with a minimal to no fee exchange and its base, with a network for instant transactions\nof any coins and also the ability to make any transaction private. Think what lightning network was for bitcoin\nbut quicker and for any currency.\nAlong with AI investing, spare change investing. The last thing is the fact you hold your own private key (at ETHOS you don't).\n\nSo my advice is: Do not sell your ETHOS for HOARD even thought that I am very bullish in the HOARD case. \nIt\u2019s not always about the best technology remember, but don't hesitate with HOARD very long.\n\nBut need to say they are both very decent projects. I like Hoard more and that's all. Remember that without a strong competition they would not be a true winner and how could we recognize a great gem if there isn't anything similarly good for comparison?\n\nI am using a reference to my good buddy EvilMonkey. He is an awesome writer and he did a great review about Hoard\na few days ago. You can read his article here:\nhttps://medium.com/@ICOProReivews/hoard-invest-ico-review-52f18c3227d6\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Epilogue and acknowledgment\n \nOk my friends, regular people, fans of crypto, early adopters and decent readers, you have made it again.\n\nThis is the end of this sorry and I frankly thank all of you for your kind attention and wish you all have a great day \n(...or a bad day, depends on your level of self-sadomasochism, haha).\n\nFor me is the Hoard Invest the winner of this Clash of Titans and We my friend will meet again in Jason Davis interview, which will be pretty awesome.\n\n                                 Future will show, who will bow,\n                            Who shall be victorious in Titan's brawl.",

            "text": "#Abra Announces the Addition of Seven More Cryptocurrenies to Its App\n\nAbra, a close competitor to Coinbase, has announced that it will be adding seven more cryptocurrencies to its mobile app. Agur (REP), Status (SNT), 0x (ZRX), Stellar (XLM), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), Stratis (STRAT), and DigiByte (DGB) will all be featured, meaning that Abra now offers 20 cryptocurrencies through its application.\n\nThis looks like another stepping stone towards Abra becoming one of the dominant fiat-to-crypto exchanges in the industry. Abra is available worldwide and supports 70 fiat currencies including USD. Their service is reasonably easy to use as customers can send money to the app via bitcoin, wire transfers, ACH transfers, and also send money with supported credit and debit cards. Abra has also drawn the interest of day-traders by not charging for exchanging between cryptocurrencies. For instance, exchanging OmiseGo (OMG) for ZCash (ZEC) will not cost the trader anything (although Abra makes it clear that the company makes money from the spread).\n\nThe way Abra manages to offer so many cryptocurrencies is through their use of \u2018synthetic digital assets.\u2019 These are smart contracts created for the purpose of exposing their customers to the volatility of the market while not holding the physical elements of the cryptocurrencies you invest in. At the moment, all cryptocurrency actions are handled by bitcoin (which may soon change to litecoin), and their synthetic digital assets ensure that your money is pegged to the price of the coin you have chosen. This essentially makes Abra a derivatives market.\n\nAt the moment, Abra is still lacking features such as the ability to withdraw some cryptocurrencies from the application and the ability to change your transaction fee when sending bitcoin.\n\nAbra has stated that they are working on \u2018adding more digital assets\u2019 to their service but have not announced which ones they are planning just yet.\n\n**Source:** https://cryptodisrupt.com/abra-announces-the-addition-of-seven-more-cryptocurrenies-to-its-app/",

When the profitable events happen the amount of profit is immediately split into 2 parts. 84% is reinvested, 16% is concerted to BTC or ETH and used as buy pressure to purchase directly OptiToken on any exchange.\n\n16% will be used to buy pressure.. How do you know that 16% i enough? What if you need to invest 25% to keep a positive momentum, how will this affect optitokens?\n\nCould you also explain in what you will reinvest the 84% in and will it happen automatically or?\"\n\n**A.** \"Hi thanks for te question. To begin 16% will be quite sufficient, HOWEVER as we go along that number may need to be adjusted to best suit the OptiToken protocol. Bear in mind too that we are looking for certain thresholds before executing the buy portion of protocol. So if 16% profit from a particular cycle wouldn\u2019t be enough to affect upward movement on an exchange based on avg volumes or open sell orders than we\u2019ll simply put that amount aside and wait, in fact we may take those funds and use them for short \u201cfunding\u201d orders to optimize that amount even more. Once it = or > the threshold we deem necessary than we will execute a buy(s). Sell walls may be sorely ad they were placed there as we chew through them and push higher.\n\nAs for the remaining % which is actually 82%, as 2% will go toward operational costs so that we have a profitable and sustainable business, that portion will be automated and indeed and will go right back into the \u201cbuy basket\u201d to buy the next \u201coversold\u201d target based on %\u2019s and RSI\u2019s.\"",

            "text": "the **Assistive Reality^ARX** token ICO is now live! \nif you act soon you can get Day 1 or Week 1 pricing\n(https://aronline.io)\n\n**Who we are**\nAt Assistive Reality we're a project dedicated to creating Augmented and Mixed reality applications for Microsoft, Intel, Google, Apple and other smartglass/AR platforms. We use a variety of tools and platforms such as Vuforia, Unity3D, ARCore and ARKit. Our apps are cutting edge; running on smart-glasses and integrating both AI-assistance and blockchain (for personal data storage, globally-roaming device independent profiles, and encrypted biometric ID storage). \n\nOur ICO is live for the next 7 weeks; I recommend Buying in the next few days as the Day 1 and then Week 1 pricing is amazing.\n\n**Use of the Utility Token** (ARX)\nARX tokens can be used for a variety of things, such as:\nPlaying AR games from our partner developers within World 1\n    Accessing premium multiplayer AR zones\n    Renting, claiming or purchasing physical locations for AR content (advertising or other shared usages)\n    Placing advertising banners into locations in World 1\n    Placing business locations and interactive purchase bots into AR zones (e.g. shopping malls, bus stops, walkways)\n    Creating consumable AR tours within World 1\n    Activating AI-guidance within World 1\n    Activating AI-guidance within Profession\n    Purchasing a content or skills pack within World 1\n    Purchasing a profession or hobby skills pack within Profession\n    Corporate clients of the Spectrum engine will consume ARX for site licensing\n    Corporate clients of the Spectrum engine will consume ARX for application feature enablement\n    Corporate clients of the Spectrum engine will consume ARX for in-app purchase conversion\n and are also included in our corporate licensing contracts, so have a natural price floor. They're also listed on two leading cryptocurrency exchanges already, with more support coming.\n\n**ARX** runs on the Ethereum blockchain only as we feel it has one of the strongest futures; and we rely on its smart contract functionality to create our trustless ICO and redemption contracts.\n\n**Participation**: https://aronline.io/participate-in-the-ico \nTo participate you only have to send ARX to the ICO smart contract and it will automatically send you the ARX tokens back. There are verification links on the website for the source code, Etherscan links to the Token and ICO smart contract, etc.\n\nThe https://aronline.io website features the details you may want on the technology and company structure, a full company whitepaper, the ICO instructions PDF, the wallet and token config guide PDF, and all information you may desire about the team. You can reach out to our staff anytime on staff@aronline.io.\n\nWe are a registered Australian company and we are running an ethical, legitimate ICO. We have been hit with many scam attempts by people offering ICO services and Youtube videos and paid-for-reviews and advertising. However we instead have focused on ethical advertising and performing verification, public auditing of our smart contracts, and KYC-validation for all of our team & company.\n\nWe will have a slow-start to our ICO due to marketing lead time / ramp up delay so you have an opportunity to pick the ARX tokens up cheaper, now.\n\nHere are some links you may use to grab information, interact with our staff, or otherwise check us out. You can also email me directly on travisroe@aronline.io or catch any of our other staff in the same way (firstnameSurname@aronline.io). Or reach to staff@aronline.io if you don't mind who responds.\n\nThanks for your consideration to participate in our Ethereum token **ICO** !! \n\n**Link to instructions, ARX token guide with full specs and github link, and ICO contract** https://aronline.io/participate-in-the-ico\n\n**LinkedIn**\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/assistive-reality/\n\n**BitcoinTalk thread**\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3092218\n\n**GitHub**\nhttps://github.com/assistivereality\n\n**Whitepaper 2018 v1.9 PDF:**\nhttps://github.com/assistivereality/ico/raw/master/whitepaper/Assistive%20Reality%20aronline.io%20Whitepaper%20and%20ICO%20v1.9.pdf\n\n**Twitter:**\nhttps://twitter.com/aronline_io/\n\n**Instagram:**\nhttps://www.instagram.com/AssistiveReality/\n\n**Facebook:**\nhttps://www.facebook.com/AssistiveReality/\n",

            "text": "CoinRace is a new game based on Ethereum, which has all chances to become the new CryptoKitties. This time, the focus is on the race track, on which branded cars marked with the signs of the main cryptocurrencies move. Smart contracts are responsible for the economic part, and the game itself is written in Solidity language. If you look at the cryptocurrency rate every day and want to exclaim *\u201cI knew that this coin would rise today!\u201d* this game is just for you.\n\n**How to play?**\n\nTo start playing, you need open the site http://coinrace.co, go to \u201cPlay on Ropsten\u201d (later \u201cPlay on mainnet\u201d) and select the race in which you want to participate. At the moment there are 4 options to choose from:\n\n* Old School Race \u2014 for those who believe in traditional cryptocurrencies, which appeared at the dawn of the crypto market. Here you can bet on Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin.\n\n* Smart Coins Race \u2014 project bids that support or plan to support smart contracts: NEM, Cardano, Ethereum or EOS.\n\n* Bitcoin Forks Race \u2014 the name of the route speaks for itself \u2014 here you can bet on bitcoin itself or on its forks: Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Gold.\n\n* Anonymous Race \u2014 for those who believe that the real cryptocurrency should be anonymous. Here are Monero, Dash, Slash, and Bytecoin.\n\nYou choose the race and the coin you want to bet on (the MetaMask plugin must be installed in your browser first \u2014 it allows you to make transactions in the Ethereum network directly from the browser), buy RACE tokens and bet on the car (coin) that you think will show the best growth for a certain period (currently races lasting 4 hours are available). The speed of the car is determined by the percentage change in the rate of the real coin price to USD relative to the time of the start of the race.\n\nIf your bet wins and the cryptocurrency really shows the biggest growth among other coins on the route, you get a reward according to the following formulas:\n\n    your_deposit = bet - penalty\n    your_win_percentage = your_deposit / (win_car_total_deposits / 100)\n    your_win_tokens = total_deposit / 100 * your_win_percentage\n\n**Bets on the fall of cryptocurrency**\n\nIn the future, at CoinRace you will be able to bet on the fall of the exchange rate. Now you can only bet on the maximum growth acceleration. But in the future, it will be possible to put on the maximum drop.\n\n**Integration with Raiden Network**\n\nScaling and speeding up the betting process. To do this, the project considers integration with Raiden Network and possibly Plasma. Raiden Network will allow opening a payment channel between the player and the race, within which there will be fast (and almost free) transactions. Obtaining the winning results will occur in Ethereum mainchain.\n\n**Internal DEX**\n\nThe creation of DEX (decentralized exchange) is a logical development of the CoinRace functionality. The internal exchange is needed in order to be able to accept any ERC20 tokens during the game, as well as to have the actual rate of these tokens inside the CoinRace smart contract. This will allow the platform to become even more decentralized and not to take rates from centralized crypto exchanges, as it does at the moment.\n\nCoinRase is not only a game \u2014 it is a whole platform on which it is possible to create other decentralized totes. For example, the platform created by CoinRace can be used to create services where users will bet on the outcome of sporting events. Community members can create their own games and make a profit.\n\nUPD:\nSlightly updated formula to be more simple to read.",

You purchase Rock2 Token and hold in your wallet, they deposit the according ethereum (using shapeshift) into your account every month..\n\nThe Rock2 token represent shares in a mining operation. One of the key advantages (and why its called ICE ROCK) are that ASIC miners are operating out of a retired Military Bunker at consistent Low Temperatures in the Cold Mountains. In this Mountain, the internal temperature sits at a low and constant 12 degrees Celsius year round. Thus, drastically reducing cooling costs.\n\nAlso the bunker sources energy from a hydro-electric power generator, so the electricity cost is low (.03 cents per KWH). Huge profit margins compared to other mining operations and a cool idea to get involved with. A very energy sustainable Bitcoin mining operation.\n\nEvery month they take 20% of their mining profits, and use it to buy more miners to add to the work force. This will grow the operation very fast, and give investors a better payout each month.\n\nYou invest into this ASIC mining operation and you get monthly passive income deposited into your wallet. The amount mined will increase every month, and your monthly payouts have the potential to increase every month. Its catching a lot of steam right now, about 3 million dollars raised. Remember, MyEtherWallet works the best for this ICO.\n\nHere are some Multiple high ratings from different ICO ratings websites:\n\nFound ICO rating 8.3 /10 - https://foundico.com/ru/ico/ice-rock-mining.html\n\nICO Marks 8.1 /10 Rating - https://icomarks.com/ico/ice-rock-mining\n\nTrack ICO 4.4 /5 - https://www.trackico.io/ico/ice-rock-mining/\n\nHere are some interviews with the team:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDls3HOE83s&t=170s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocED6vV8cKE&t=203s",

            "text": "**Introducing The Synapse Market**\n\n*Smart Contracts Need Oracles. We developed a marketplace to list and purchase oracles.*\n\n**Overview**\nSynapse is an open platform for creating, sharing, and monetizing deterministic oracles from data feeds (such as exchange rates, sports scores, IoT sensor data, etc.) for use in smart contracts. The grand vision is to reduce the friction involved in using external data in blockchain-based smart contracts. The instant access to oraclized data feeds from the Synapse Marketplace will be the accelerant to the forthcoming smart contract revolution.\n\n**Team/Foundation**\nThe Synapse Foundation was formed to promote and oversee the Synapse Network and Marketplace. The Foundation\u2019s mission is to foster the creation of the world\u2019s best open marketplace for data. Synapse was founded by a group led by Nick Spanos, who is one of the earliest adopters. He founded Bitcoin Center NYC in 2013 and serves as CEO of Blockchain Technologies Corp. Spanos was featured in the recent documentary Banking on Bitcoin and has been featured in many conferences on blockchain technology.\n\n**Want Smart Contracts? You Need Oracles**\nSmart contracts and decentralized applications (\u00d0apps) must be connected with off-chain relays called oracles to utilize data from the outside world. There is currently no standardized way of creating data oracles, leading to many smart contracts/\u00d0apps using their own unique implementations. For the entire ecosystem to grow, there must be a convenient, standard way for smart contracts to use external data. Synapse is the answer to this problem.\n\nWhile there are existing platforms and methods for creating smart contract oracles, there has yet to be a standardized place to discover existing oracles or publish new oracles. Synapse fills this gap by introducing a data marketplace, making it simple and easy to discover pre-made oracles for use in smart contracts and \u00d0apps. This allows all parties to a smart contract the ability to agree on the source of data and have faith in the way that the data is delivered.\n\n**Data Democratization/Monetization (IoT)**\nThe Synapse Marketplace incentivizes data providers to list their data feeds through the ability to charge for access to the data, and the ability to easily monetize data incentivizes additional new data providers to enter the market. By making Synapse an open, free market it allows for everyone from individuals to big businesses to list and monetize their data and make it available for use in smart contracts. We believe this will lead to more people making money from data and high quality data becoming easily accessible to everyone.\n\n**Deterministic Oracles & The Synapse Marketplace**\nThe advantage of deterministic oracles (in comparison to crowd consensus oracles, such as those employed by Gnosis/Augur) is that they provide smart contracts with a connection to immediate information about the current state of the world. They can gather data directly from a single source or data feed (e.g. flight info and sport statistics). Deterministic oracles are more efficient, reliable, and can flexibly scale to all network sizes.\n\nOf course, using a deterministic oracle from a single or small group of sources introduces another issue: trust. To mitigate the risks involved with trusting a particular data provider, the Synapse Marketplace introduces a reputation/feedback system (\u201coracle curation layer\u201d). Quality data feeds will be featured and questionable sources will be pushed to the bottom. In addition, verified data sources - such as price feeds directly from an exchange - will get a special badge signifying their identity has been verified.\n\n**Summary**\nSynapse aims to create the first, standardized and self-sustained smart contract data layer by offering a three part solution. First, by creating a global, decentralized marketplace where users can publish or subscribe to data feeds. Second, by connecting smart contracts to the real-time data necessary for smart contracts to execute (oraclization). Third, by implementing peer to peer curation for ranking and verifying oracles.\n\n----\n\nFind out more information on our website synapsemarket.com or dive into our technical whitepaper. Questions?

Also how does this really work in the future? I get all my groceries via mail all from each manufacturer? So now all these cpg companies are forced to get into logistics and spend costs on mailing their products to individuals homes instead of the usual semi truck delivery to a warehouse that then re distributes it to your local store. This is far fectched and very ambitious. I expect this team to fail miserably. The world is not ready for this change. For me to believe that's even possible I'd need to see a roadmap and some analysis on how they are to actually pull this off",

            "text": "I do not envy those who joined ICOs a month ago. This is some real pain. Many assets\u2019 price is down by 30-40-50%. Now the market shows a clear trend: \"Wait for the ICO to finish and buy twice cheaper.\"\nMany market participants were attracted by a guaranteed profit on the expectations of Bitcoin Gold's hardfork, which became one of the reasons for the rally. And while bitcoin continued its triumphal march, altcoins plunged into an abyss of total horror.\nThe asset volume started its movement and redistribution.\n\nThis was preceded by a thorough preparation - shaking out market participants with \"negative\" news from China and large players buying at 3600. A good dramatization brought them their 100% profit, not bad!\nIn just three months, the domination index rose from 37% to 61%. Bitcoin absorbed a huge part of the market.\n\nBitcoin has reached local targets now and is waiting for an imminent correction. One important question remains unanswered: Where exactly will the cash flows be directed during the correction? Either money will leave the market, or be redistributed within it.\n\nUnder the second scenario, we have a good potential for a number of assets. It can even be assumed that the ICO authors themselves are now buying them at the lowest price.\nSo, I offer you a few ideas that can bring a good profit!\n\nLunyr (LUN) - a decentralized knowledge base on the Ethereum blockchain..\nThe technical overview suggests cautious purchases from the level of 3-3.5 $. There are at least three reasons why this can work.\n\nFirst, the downward trend is broken, secondly, we saw the initiative buying volume, and thirdly, now there is a retest of volume profile in May-August 2017.\n\nTrading Idea: Buy Lunyr in the range of 3-3.5 on the descending channel retest. The deal size is 10-12% of the portfolio, the stop signal is 20% below the  purchase level. The target is in the range of 10-11, which is about 200% of potential growth. The investment horizon is 2-3 months.\n\nElastic (XEL) - a supercomputer based on cloud computing.\n\nThe technical overview suggest purchases from 0.25. There are four reasons why this idea can work.\n\nFirst, the retest of the downward channel has been completed from top to bottom, and secondly, the retest of the basic volume profile (July 2017) is completed, and thirdly, the daily closure candlestick is likely to be above the support line and will leave a long shadow. Fourth, we saw an initiative volume for the purchase, which has not yet moved into the development of a growing trend, but will strive for this realization.\nTrading idea: Purchase Elastic from 0.25, the amount of the deal - 8-10% of the portfolio, the stop signal is 30% of the purchase level in the 0.175 area. The target is in the range of 0.65, which is approximately 150% from current values. Investment horizon is 2 months.\n\nKick Coin (Kick) -  ICO platform.\nThis token from the third division has been attracting my attention for a long time, and now it's time for careful purchases. After the asset has descended to 0.025, it was returned to the level of 0.0320 and if it is strong enough, then the movement to the area 0.0450, 0.0520 can develop.\n\nUnfortunately, the asset is not yet available on the tradingview service for displaying as a usual chart, but even this way it is possible to determine the nearest targets.\n\nTrading Idea: Buy Kick from 0.032, the size of the deal is 10-12% of the portfolio. The stop signal is 25% below the buy level in the 0.025 area. The target is 0.0450-0.0520, which is 40%-62.5% growth from current values. The investment horizon is 2-4 weeks.\n\nIn general, alttoken has a lot of attractive ideas and in the near future we will review some of them. Pressure from Bitcoin will go away and individual assets will be able to please their Holders.\n\nThank you for your attention, with you was the crypto-futurist Vadique Magenta.\n",

The quality of the projects increases too, people understand the Blockchain and its peculiarities deeper;\n\n- Since last year real projects are created, that is new scripts which create value, new characteristics are found;\n\n- cryptography and economic constraints are used in the cryptoanalytical consensus. It limits the degree of a person's participation and rewards or punishes right/wrong part;\n\n- Proof of work is the first consensus of the algorithm that runs the Blockchain. The idea is: there is a network with 1000 computers. They manage the network, blocks and transactions. To participate in the block\u2019s development, each computer need to use 100% of its time and solve math problems. By themselves, the tasks are useless, they are designed to prove that a person has a unit of computational power. Roughly speaking, that 1 computer = 1 computer, not 1 million virtual machines of a single hacker. It takes a lot of energy and electricity;\n\n- From Proof of work we want to come to Proof of stake. The level of a person\u2019s participation in the system depends on its estimated power which he can provide and the number of coins which he puts into the system. If you have an ether, the system will give you some right to participate. That's interesting, because then there is no need to have a real hardware, spend a lot of electricity. The participation fee can be decreased to 10-100 times, you can become a validator and verify transactions from a laptop or smartphone (if it has enough ether);\n\n**- Next year the miners will have nothing to do;**\n\n- The next stage (in a few months) of Ethereum \u2014 metropolis. It will be much easier for smart contracts to integrate with the cryptographic algorithms;\n\n- After the story of The DAO, I realized that the code is not infinitely strong principle. In some extreme cases it is necessary to take extreme measures;\n\n- Every hack can\u2019t be solved by hardfork. To avoid hacks it\u2019s too necessary to raise the level of security of smart contracts and the Protocol;\n\n- An important benchmark of Etherum\u2019s success \u2014 the scalability of the platform;\n\n- Capitalization of Ethereum is based on the faith in the idea of the blockchain and the developing ecosystem;\n\n- There are several approaches to provide interoperability between blockchain systems, such as BTCRelay (the connection between bitcoin and Ethereum networks), the principle of Hush Timelock contract (the transaction simultaneously takes place in both blockchain systems) and smaller approaches. Everyone wait for use case, i.e. the necessity of the usage of two different blockchains;\n\n- Ethereum is a complete open source. Software with the open source is useful but it has always been difficult to monetize. The feature of open source is that it helps many people, but only a little bit. In this sense, ICO can change the situation, Ethereum exists because of it;\n\n- Courses on Ethereum: online course on blockchain and cryptocurrency of Stanford, our blogs and articles, wiki. I advise you to watch the existing blockchain projects, and if they have an open source, copy it from there and try to make something of your own;\n\n**- Putin knows about the blockchain and it is the peak of the hype;**\n\n- Plasma is a new solution to the scalability of Ethereum. The basic idea is to move from a model in which all transactions are recorded to the blockchain (this is the bottleneck), to the structure of the bilateral exchange of messages confirming the transfer of value.\n\nAbout myself and the team\n\n- Now I have no time to watch the projects. I'm immersed in work over a platform that each participant has the opportunity to work with it. I think this is the best assistance to any blockchain project;\n\n- That part of the community Ethereum, which is engaged in the development of the Protocol, grows. Initially, only 3 persons worked over Ethereum, the chief of whom was me, but soon the team will reach the stage when people will be able to work for themselves. I need less and less;\n\n- In the beginning we thought of doing a commercial organization. If we did, the first participants of the project now would have a billion dollars. At the result we decided to go the other way: to make public and outdoor blockchain, a neutral platform which is available to the world;\n\n- Ethereum Foundation is a non \u2014 profit organization that finances Ethereum, pays the developers. The first Fund was assembled by crowdfunding and had 30 thousand of bitcoins, which were enough for the next 2 years. Then we had 6 million units of the ether, which we used as a reward to the programmers for their help in development. Now we have 3 million units of ether, which we either directly paid to the programmers for their work or sell on the exchange.\n\nAbout ICO\n\n**- If your team is scam, please don't do ICO;**\n\n- The ICO should do if: the project will bring real benefits to the token, will play an important role (e.g., as  the scalability of the business), the Economics of the project works and has the logic;\n\n- Now many companies, going out to ICO,  don\u2019t understand the logic and Economics of the business model. The token should be filled with commercial sense, otherwise this is gonna turn into a bubble;\n\n- Cryptobanks \u2014 a dangerous thing due to the volatility of cryptocurrency. If five years ago I promised to give 5 bitcoins to somebody, it would be difficult;\n\n- You need to make an investments under an idea, but not under a command. To implement this idea you need to plug some commands by funding them in installments for a certain step and based on the results of the team. In fact it's a competition.",

To automate the process, me and my buddies have created this tool **http://matchcoins.info/**\n\nIt gives you a good indicator for the potential of the coin or if you will, a starting point for making any further assumptions.\n\nHow to use it: \n1) On the left, select the base currency (the more established one) \n2) On the right, select the coin that you\u2018re interested in \n3) See the potential price of the second coin if it reached the market cap of the first one\n\nE.g. ETH on the left, ICX on the right. The price of ICX if its market cap reaches ETH market cap would be $ 254.33, 31.83x times the current price. At 75% of ETH market cap, ICX = $ 190.75\n\nIn addition, we\u2018ve added another feature to compare coins by their levels of supply (either total or circulating). We normalize the price of the coin by removing unit bias.\nThis feature gives you a good view of the coins that look \"cheap\" but are probably not as cheap as they seem.\n\nE.g: We assume that XRP had the same circulating supply as BTC, and use the formula (XRP Supply / BTC supply * XRP Price) to remove unit bias. Under these conditions, XRP price would be $ 3,177. Matching by total supply, XRP price = $ 6,568\n\nIt's definitely not as cheap as it seemed.

            "text": "1. BitDegree\n============\n\nEducation seems to be of those areas where a blockchain could be used to improve most aspects of the traditional ways of interacting, transacting, and storing data. It's also an area that has received relatively little attention compared to the things like banking. BitDegree is an online education platform on the Ethereum blockchain. They want to improve return on investment for learners and the availability of people with the skills that companies need. Companies act as sponsors, buying tokens in the recruitment process, while building their brand and advertising. For students, coins are used to purchase educational services and as an incentive structure similar to scholarships.\n\n\nMarket\n------\n- Education is a stable market, with demand that inherently scales with the global population size\n- They understand the trend at the tech-education interface, which is free large-scale online learning\n- They're targeting a real revenue source in the recruiment market\n- Addressing real problems -- educational incentives, supply of needed skills, RoI\n\n\nTeam\n----\nBitDegree has a strong team that contains a good mix of roles, including several people with technical experience (as opposed to the teams composed almost entirely of businesspeople that we see all too often). The CEO previously built the cloud web hosting provider 000webhost. The team does not come from a background in education or education administration/management. However, they seem to have a good understanding of the market and its problems.\n\nNotable advisors include:\n- Jeff Burton, Co-founder of Electronic Arts\n- Arnas Stuopelis, CEO of web hosting provider Hostinger\n\n\nRelevant Partners\n-----------------\n- Preply, a platform for matching students to private tutors\n\n\nAccountability (where BitDegree suffers a bit)\n--------------\n- Little information provided about the company itself (e.g. location, if it's incorporated, type)\n- Little information about their legal situation and regulatory landscape (a concern with most ICOs)\n- No discussion of escrow for funds\n- Their MVP is just some boilerplate static course pages\n\n\nSummary\n-------\n- Education is a good sector for applying blockchain tech\n- A way to transparently track student identities and credentials while maintaining privacy\n- Avenue for monetizing the free open course education model\n- Targeting a real revenue source in the education market\n- Real utility / areas of improvement for both students and employers\n\n\nICO Dates\n---------\nDecember 1 - December 31\n\n\n2. Qchain\n=========\n\nI've been following Qchain for some time now, and they've just recently started their ICO. Qchain is a marketing and advertising platform built on the Ethereum and NEM blockchains. Their main product is an accessible direct-buy ad marketplace, with a focus on native advertising and integrated personal data management features. They want to use blockchain tech to provide more control to advertisers and publishers, increase transparency and privacy, and cut out overhead from middle-men. In my opinion, this is one of the more underhyped and undervalued ICOs.\n\n\nMarket\n------\n- Digital advertising is a massive industry and a huge growth market\n- They understand the trends in online advertising and where problems exist\n- They're targeting the future revenue centers of online advertising -- native display ads and data management\n- Addressing real problems -- overcentralization, transparency/privacy, RoI and efficiency\n\n\nTeam\n----\nQchain has a strong team that hails from a variety of big names in the media, tech, financial, and academic sectors. One of the biggest draws here is that most of the team has both a technical background and varying degrees of experience in advertising, marketing, financial, and media roles. They have one of the most relevant advisory boards I've seen for any ICO.\n\nNotable advisors include:\n- Lon Wong, President of the NEM Foundation\n- Kailin O'Donnell, NEM Foundation founding member and core team developer\n- Misho Ceko, COO of the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy\n- Grant Fondo, Chair of the Blockchain Technology Practice at Goodwin Procter LLP\n- Evgeny Yurtaev/Alexey Bashlykov, CEO/CTO of Zerion (one of the original Solidity development groups)\n\n\nRelevant Partners\n-----------------\n- LuxTag, a platform for digitally tagging and tracking goods and assets using blockchain\n- Xhai Studios, a mobile apps, games, web, and blockchain app development studio\n- Cryptogene, a platform for blockchain tech integration in Africa via knowledge exchanges and decentralized markets\n\n\nAccountability\n--------------\n- US company based in California\n- Has done due diligence in legal and regulatory compliance\n- Followed through on their word to ICO after releasing a demo and perform legal due diligence\n- Escrow for their ICO funds, with 2 third-party accounts on both their NEM and Ethereum wallets\n\n\nSummary\n-------\n- US-based company backed by a strong law firm\n- Dual blockchain support with Ethereum and NEM\n- Targeting the growth centers in the advertising market\n- Has released a demo\n- Real product and tech briefings (instead of buzzword whitepaper)\n- Real utility / areas of improvement for both advertisers and publishers\n\n\nICO Dates\n---------\nNow - December 5\n\n\n3. Bankera\n==========\n\nThough certainly not a small fish, I'm including Bankera here because it's actually an interesting project with long-term prospects, among the field of various financial ICOs that have sprung up.\n\n\nTeam\n----\nThey have a solid team, with a mix of technical experience and relevant industry experience. Unlike most of the banking ICOs, they are building off an existing product -- Spectrocoin, a cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service that includes a debit card for spending with Bitcoin.\n\nNotable advisors include:\n- Lon Wong, President of the NEM Foundation\n- Modestas Kaseliauskas, Former Head of Lithuania's State Tax Inspectorate\n- Antanas Guoga/Eva Kaili, European Parliament members\n\n\nWhile Spectrocoin is a far cry from Bankera's stated objectives, this shows they actually have existing financial infrastructure to attempt something as ambitious as Bankera. Contrast this to the likes of Monaco and Centra, which have yet to answer to investors or deliver a coherent plan, and are perhaps most notable for defrauding investors by selling them on a made-up partnership with VISA (way to burn a bridge with the world's largest card processor outside of China). Bankera is aiming for legitimate integration into the banking sector, with banking licenses in the EU, UK, Japan, and Singapore on the roadmap (the US is not specifically mentioned, more on this later).\n\n\nAccountability\n--------------\n- Based in Lithuania\n- Needs to follow banking laws in areas where it's obtained banking licenses\n- No discussion of escrow for funds\n\n\nInvestor Caveat\n---------------\nA lot of ICOs are using a blanket claim of being a 'utility token' and not a security (however most do not have any clear utility like BitDegree and Qchain do).\n\nBankera's token is explicitly a security, as the entire purpose of the BNK token is to entitle holders to a dividend from Bankera and SpectroCoin's revenue. This in and of itself is okay, as Bankera intends to integrate into the existing banking system and obtain banking licenses according to its whitepaper. The first con associated with this is that by integrating into existing banking sectors subjects, it itself to much of the central control and limitations of traditional banking.\n\nThe other potential issue, which is probably of greater interest to token buyers, is how the token is treated in locales where Bankera has not established legitimate banking ties. While this is probably not a problem Bankera's home locale of Lithuania, it will likely be an issue in large markets such as the US (which Bankera has not named among its target markets in its whitepaper roadmap) if Bankera does not specifically target these markets and acquire the appropriate local licenses. For example, in the US, Bankera's model blatantly violates federal securities laws unless Bankera registers with the SEC and obtains a money transmitter license.\n\nAs for the token itself and investors, this becomes problematic if (when) the SEC and its counterparts in other countries start imposing regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges. Otaining proper licenses to conduct banking, money transmission, and securities issuing activities are not simple, fast, or cheap processes. Following the US/SEC example, a plausible worst-case scenario would see BNK tokens ineligible to listed on (or be delisted from) US-based exchanges (which includes Poloniex) until all the bureaucracy is sorted out. Of course, this would present liquidity problems to all of the investors in these locations. While Bankera may end up getting the proper licenses in the US and elsewhere, this presents a tricky situation in general, as you have the traditional banking and securities regulations of every country versus a blockchain token which is an inherently global asset.\n\n\nICO Dates\n---------\nNovember 27 - ?",

            "text": "tl;dr Hydrominer and its CEO have been operating in a very scammy manner. Hopefully this post will push them to get their act together and address some of the concerns in a public manner.\n\n* **A. FALSE STATEMENTS.**\n\nThe Hydrominer website states that a \"mining portal\" is open and functional. \n\nA tick mark next to \"Mining portal\" is prominently displayed on the website and quoting directly \"Hydrominer offers since February 2018 in their mining portal the redeeming of H2O Tokens for mining contracts that last 2 years. Mining contracts can also be purchased with fiat money, BTC, ETH and other cryptocurrencies. Customers can choose if they want to mine Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether, Ether Classic or Zcash. Other currencies will follow.\"\n\nOn a different page (so it can't be a typo) they state \"Since February 2018 the mining portal is open where H2O Tokens can be redeemed towards mining time\". \n\nThe word CURRENTLY is also used \"Currently, customers can decide if they want to mine Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether, Ether Classic or Zcash. \" \n\n\nLIVE SOURCE:\nhttps://www.hydrominer.org/roadmap/\nhttps://www.hydrominer.org/h2o/\n\nARCHIVED SOURCE:\nhttp://archive.is/WrJRS\nhttp://archive.is/zWouB\n\n\n* **B. MISINFORMATION ABOUT START OF MINING AND ENDLESS DELAYS.**\n\n\nOn January 7th the CEO states \"the interface for the users will be released 1st of february 2018.\"\n\nSOURCE:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20180217192107/https://medium.com/@nadine_3242/update-of-the-h3o-token-sale-2800ffe2bab\n\n\nOn February 5th the CEO states \"we will have the mining portal up and running on our servers by Wednesday.\" Wednesday was February 7th.\n\nSOURCE:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20180217192619/https://medium.com/@nadine_3242/update-hydrominer-mining-portal-facility-photos-h30-more-b223ff6fc9d6\n\nOn February 15th the CEO states \"Everything will be finalized and connected by the end of the week\"\n\nSOURCE:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20180217192746/https://medium.com/@nadine_3242/update-mining-portal-implementation-b0f3c1719d1d\n\n\n* **C. MISSING 1% OF FUNDS.**\n\nThe whitepaper states that \"1% of the raised funds to buy BNT and and create a Bancor-H2O \u201ctoken changer\u201d\".\n\nFurthermore Hydrominer states that \"HydroMiner will deposit 1% of its ICO proceeds into a Bancor token changer smart contract.HydroMiner expect the Bancor token changer will be operational within 30 days of the closing of the token sale.\"\n\nAs of today, ~3 months after the ICO ended, there is no Bancor token changer and the 1% of funds is unaccounted for.\n\nARCHIVED SOURCES:\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20171120101646/https://www.hydrominer.org/wp-content/uploads/HydroMiner.pdf\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20171108230305/https://www.hydrominer.org/hydrominer-partners-bancor-continuous-liquidity/\n\n\n\n* **D. THE MINING CALCULATOR SAGA.**\n\nBefore and during the ICO, Hydrominer featured a mining calculator promising incredible returns on H2O investment. See image here: https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmWMrNrLptuN5haUnxt7RcuamP1EySiT9iWcmSk4xuVZt5/hydrominercalc.jpg\n and whitepaper here: https://imgur.com/a/OWMhi\n\nAt end of ICO, the calculator was mysteriously taken down. When community raised concerns Hydrominer said it would be back up. 3 months later the calculator is missing.\n\n\nOn January 13th the CEO states \"we are working on this and hope it will be done in the last week of January\"\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20180204080303/https://medium.com/@nadine_3242/h20-exchange-listing-e2e88396847b\n\n\n\n\n\n* **E. VALUATION OF H2O TOKEN**\n\nAt ICO, Hydrominer sold tokens for 1 H2O = 0.01 ETH. They promised ICO investors a better deal than future customers.\nCurrently, Hydrominer is valuating 1 H2O = 0.004 ETH (3.08 EURO) on their website. By completely devalueing the tokens they have royally screwed early investors and driven exchange prices down.\n\n\nThere are several other issues circulating within the community, regarding unpaid bounties, \"alleged\" token burns etc. The telegram channel is rife with complaints. These issues are buried in telegram and thus not transperant. I hope this post will be a catalyst for these issues to be addressed openly and transperantly. The token burn transaction hash? The 1% ETH address?\n\nHydrominer is launching a new ICO for a new token H3O security. Once again there is an impossible ROI calculator on the website and it appears the pattern of misleading marketing is resuming.\n\nDo not mislead new H3O investors into thinking you have a functional product (H2O) like your website suggests.\n\nDo not misinform customers.",

I dont just mean a list of every possible ICO like ICOtracker or ICOwatchlist, but rather a list of legit ICO's managed similar to how r/3dprinting manages their recommendations based on month (see [top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/6koe6q/3d_printing_purchase_recommendations_what_printer/?sort=top)). This thread would be run by the mods and always pinned.\n\nHaving something similar with headers like ONGOING, AUGUST, SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER, and listing ICO's with their date, a short description and the link would become a powerful tool for this subreddit, while being very easy to maintain. I have made an example shown at the bottom.\n\nThis seems like a good method for keeping faster tabs on the info, rather than every person needing to comb through all these posts. While also giving very little suggestive information to allow everyone to make their own informed decisions. The goal of this is to weed out the objectively bad ones from the ones with potential, in a very simple way.\n\nIt will be easily managed by having users suggest an ICO by commenting in this fashion:\n\n> ######**ICO X** - July 5th, 2017\n>     \n> Description description description description description description description\n>     \n> LinkX\n\nand based on the number of upvotes vs active people on the thread, the mods can decide whether or not to add it to the list.  This would become an awesome tool for this community that can provide lots of very useful information.\n\nHere is an example of what i'm talking about:\n\n#ONGOING\n\n######**ICO A** - June 23rd, 2017\n\nWe at team A want to create the new bitcoin\n\nLinkA\n\n######**ICO B** - June 25th, 2017\n\nWe are better than team A and want to create a new Ethereum\n\nLinkB\n\n#JULY\n\n######**ICO 1** - July 5th, 2017\n\ndecentralized blockchain for increasing demand of brussel sprouts in spain\n\nLink1\n\n######**ICO 2** - July 19th, 2017\n\nSed vehicula mauris ut ex luctus mollis.

He's the main driving force behind the ICO, he's been involved with mining operations prior to the ICO, interviewed by Russian news agencies for piece on Bitcoin. Sort of a crypto evangelist in Russia.\n\n**Boris Zyrianov** - Responsible for the research and development of the multiclet processor, head of OSJC Multiclet company. Along with Nikolai Streltsov (also involved in the project) were awarded a Gold Medal from the Academy of Engineering Science for their work on Multiclet processors in 2012.\n\n**Possible involvement:**\n\n**Boris Titov** - Russian billionaire and advisor to Putin on entrepreneurial matters. Russia crypto evangelist and reported to be part of new Russian ICO incubator along with...\n\n**Sasha Ivanov** - Created waves cryptocurrency.\n\nThese 2, it's not entirely clear if the RMC ICO will indeed be part of their incubator. \n\n**Other parties and relationships:**\n\n**Bitfury** - Supplies chips for Sunrise S11i miners. Founder is a Russian living in Latvia.\n\n**Mycelium** - The only platform to offer the ICO, partnered with RMC as a secure way to trade/hold the coin.\n\nThe company's and people involved seem to be coming from existing cryptocurrency  and engineering projects. The mining infrastructure already exists and this ICO is basically an expansion + R&D for Multiclet.\n\n\n**Reasonable expectations:**\n\n* Earning BTC from the shared mining pool and getting a discounted rate on some new Sunrise miners (256 SHA 22.6 TH/s (~18 owned, ~4 to RMC token holders) 2.3-2.5 kwh 16 nm)\n\n**Would be very nice:**\n\n* If the claims of the Multiclet being close are real, it could be a very huge boost, lower power usage, higher hash rate\n* Apparently a 180nm chip for mining is already developed (assuming it's been tested as a viable technology for mining), and a 28nm chip is what the development is for.\n* They say the 28nm calculations are all done, the chip/board/testing/bug fixing then manufacturer are what is planned for the ~13 mo period.\n\n**External factors**\n\n* Some in the government have been pushing for an expansion of Russian cryptocurrency use. The pending legalization of Cryptocurrencies as a traded financial instrument indicates they are moving in that direction.\n* The government has stressed the need for development of Russian made processor chips, especially after the Ukraine crisis and ensuing sanctions. Multiclet is of interest in developing Russian chips.\n* Russia has been trying for some time to attract investment and create technology clusters; some of the same key people involved are also drivers of that.\n\n*Basically you're investing in an existing mining/board/chip manufacturing and R&D company that is expanding (90% of ico money) and developing a next generation mining chip (10% of ico money).*\n\nWhite paper: https://rmc.one/static/pdf/whitepaper_EN.pdf",

It could be a good idea to build a general purpose data center with mining functionality in combination with renewable energy power generation plant. Especially if there will be external customers for generated electricity and customers for general datacenter services. I think this could be a good idea for an ICO.

Introducing - [Edgeless](https://edgeless.io) - the first Ethereum-based casino offering 0% house edge and absolute transparency.\n\n**Gambling transparency and house edge**\n\nThe fast-growing ($46B in 2016) online gambling industry has a huge problem: TRANSPARENCY. In 2017 all online casinos have full power to cheat against their own players. They can do it easily, without being spotted. It is also difficult for a casino to prove when they are not cheating. This creates a massive problem for online gambling and casts a shadow on the industry\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe problem is real. The Wizard of Odds blog about the online gambling industry has so far black-listed over 50 online casinos. These platforms have been caught cheating in many different ways, including rigging the outcome, failure to pay out, delayed funds withdrawals and many more. Bitcoin casinos are no better: [case of famous bitcoin casino caught cheating](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2v50nq/how_999dicecom_is_stealing_your_coins_and_exactly/)\n\n\nWith the Edgeless Project we aim to tackle this major industry problem and become one of the leading online casinos.\n\n**Key Edgeless Project elements:**\n\n- Edgeless Casino will accept ETH bets\n- Absolute transparency guaranteed by Ethereum Smart Contract. [Detailed explanation here](https://medium.com/edgeless/finally-we-will-have-fully-transparent-casino-in-2017-7ef1ecd845a#.6hv9kaz2c)\n- Early stage offered games: 0% edge Black Jack, 0% edge Lunar Poker, Dice, Sports Betting.\n- 0% house edge on luck+skill games such as Blackjack or Video/ Russian/ Lunar Poker. [Detailed explanation here](https://medium.com/edgeless/0-house-edge-blackjack-and-0-house-roulette-whats-a-difference-in-casino-profitability-c8d732142433)\n- 0% house edge games + absolute transparency is the perfect marketing strategy to attract masses of gamblers. [Detailed explanation here](https://medium.com/edgeless/casino-with-0-house-edge-perfect-marketing-strategy-7c1f2d49beb0#.ym4zywqm7)\n- Each month 40% of casino profits will automatically go to \u201cEdgeless Lounge\u201d prize pool. [Detailed explanation here](https://medium.com/edgeless/edgeless-lounge-fc11c6274259#.w2df2xz79)\n- EDG token can be used to win a \u201cEdgeless Lounge\u201d prize \n\n**Crowdsale of Edgeless**\n\nThe crowdfunding campaign will start on 28th of February 2017, 3:00pm GMT and the goal is to raise 360 000 ETH by selling Edgeless tokens for gambling enthusiasts.

Bankera claims to have client base with over 535.300+\n existing users. \n - Holders of Bankera tokens on Spectrocoin and Bankera platforms will receive 20% of net transactional revenue share.  \n- Competent team and strong advisory board. For example: Long Wong\n \u2013 The President of NEM.io members and Eva Kaili - a member of the European Parliament.  \n- Decent media coverage.  \n=================  \nWeak sides:\n\n- Coin will be first listed on  SpectroCoin exchange. It might negatively influence on the volume and result in a slow price growth in the short and mid-term. This problem will be solved within few days after ICO , once the token will be listed on exchanges with large daily volumes. \n- Some countries and exchanges might consider this token as security which can become an obstacle and significant problem for the Bankera team.\n- Large supply of 25 billion tokens. Some investors get scared by large supply numbers.\nBankera's ICO already has a community of 16000+ pre-ICO and 14000+ ICO contributors, so people who are interested in quick cash-out and in dumping tokens as soon as they hit the exchanges will not have a huge impact on our long-term goal.\n- Significant amount of competitors in the market.\n- Legal vulnerability of the project. While some countries might allow operations with Bankera \n\u2013 other countries will enforce restrictions with blockchain banks. This problem might be resolved in the nearest several years though. \n+++++++  \nOur verdict: This is an interesting project that solves an existing market problem and offers original solution. Bankera has strong and experienced team with influential advisory team. In our opinion this project stands out among other blockchain-banks due to an existing customers base, financial ecosystem and competent team. We have some concerns over large token supply, existing competitors and legal part of the project. However, all these problems are solves if addressed correctly. We would recommend this project for those who look for long-term investments.\n\n",

The platform will be open source. Freedom from censorship, fair rewards for publishers and anonymity (if so desired) are mentioned as key advantages.\n\n[Whitepaper](https://decent.ch/src/decent-whitepaper.pdf)\n\n**Customer Segment**\n\nContent producers, content consumers, miners (called \"Publishers\" by Decent).\n\n**Technology**\n\nThe whitepaper is not yet entirely clear on the tech stack that will be used. Blockchain technologies are mentioned, Kademlia DHT and Bittorrent for content distribution. Apparently, parts of the software are already in development.\n\n**Team**\n\nThe company mentions a Swiss and a Slovak office. There are three Founders: Matej Boda, Matej Michalko and Wayman Kwan. The core team consists of 13 persons total, plus four ambassadors and four advisors. \n\n**CV Matej B (from their website):** Matej was always interested in new technologies and future progress. During his studies at the Technical University in Bratislava he took an internship in BMW Munich as a technical concept creator. Although his background is in applied mechanics, he became involved in blockchain based technologies in 2013. Fascinated by the decentralized protocols, he was interested in the cryptocurrency mining at first. Since then he has supported the community by helping to organize events such as Central European Bitcoin Expo Vienna and Bitcoin 2 Business Congress Brussels, advising on mining technologies and discussing future possibilities for blockchain. Currently he is focusing on the main project \u2013 DECENT platform \u2013 he co-founded.\n\n**CV Matej M (from their website):** Matej\u2019s interest in online privacy was fueled first while studying Computer Science at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne where he completed a project concerning the privacy protection of mobile phone users for Nokia Research Center. Since then he became more and more involved with Bitcoin. Mining at his own laptop in the beginning, then organizing cryptocurrency conferences around the world (Austria, China, Belgium, UK, \u2026). He also founded the first Bitcoin Marketing agency in the world. Matej has operated from multiple countries, including the UK, Isle of Man, Switzerland, Slovakia or China. Since the beginning he is passionate about the immense potential of blockchain technologies. Thereby, he founded DECENT last year.\n\n**CV Wayman Kwan (from their website):** Wayman Kwan is a venture capital investor partner of Elements Capital LLC, USA. He was responsible for the business development, financing and promotional activities in several international companies. He founded a private information services team providing finance and investment advice to the companies around Asia and became a partner in Malaysian and Chinese Joint Venture. He is a well-recognized investment advisor and also participates in many other non-profit and charitable organizations such as Rotary International, Negeri Sembilan Royal Anti-drug Association and Malacca Shooting Association.\n\n[Team Page](https://decent.ch/about/#team)\n\n**ICO offering details**\n\nICO starts at 1:00pm GMT Sunday, 11th of September. Duration: 8 weeks.\n\n70% of the total available DCT (\"fuel of the network\") will be distributed initially, 30% will be made available to miners later on. Of the initial distribution, 10% of the tokens go to the Decent Foundation, 2% go into an \"Investment Fund\", 1'000'000 go to the bounty program, 3'000'000 go to the marketing program. The rest is sold in the ICO. I did not find the total number of tokens to be created, only percentage numbers. Sale starts at 5000DCT/BTC (+50% bonus on the first day, up to 10M DCT), going down to 3000DCT/BTC over time. \n\n**Update:** Decent just reiterated that \"The final amount of DCT will be determined by ICO results. DCT distributed during ICO will represent 70% of the total DCT ever issued.\" on Bitcointalk. I find the combination of relative and absolute numbers a bit confusing, but in the end, 70% seems to go out to ICO participants (plus the devs), 30% to miners. \n\n**Update 2:** Decent made the 50% bonus \"dependable\" by removing the 10M cap and prolonging it until today (September 11th), 11PM GMT. Good reaction.\n\n[ICO page](https://sale.decent.ch/) - [Homepage](https://www.decent.ch/)\n\n**Donations**\n\nSince we are talking about paid content: in case you'd like to make a small donation to the writer of this post, please send your Satoshis to: 1JsiFGmKZvr3iR4KejpMswmapCoB2oWsog",

Regulators in the world are not yet ready. But it must be understood that it will not be long before they offer derivative assets on Bitcoin will be traded and raise capital with digital money. Already there are offerings. These issues without prospectus. These offerings have no \"control\" or knowledge about the underlying asset. These offerings without apparent costs. They have no credit risk, at least ostensibly. \"\n\n\"This is not a passing phenomenon, it's here at the gates of the capital market, it's here in the stock market, is it a phenomenon that needs protection from the state?\" Regulators? We know that there are those who would like to exploit every possible loophole for illegitimate and unfair purposes.\n\n\"ICOs are one of the most interesting examples of this, a phenomenon that has been developing very recently and must be addressed.\" The issues of digital or virtual coins (ICO [they actually use the term IPCO in the original -lzys]) are interesting and present a challenge to current regulation in the world, (Cryptocurrency) for various projects, enable to bypass the current supervisory system of raised capital through the banks and the stock market. In an ICO campaign, a certain percentage of this money is sold to investors in exchange for certain rights in the developed product and with the expectation that the value of the currency will rise and can be traded. The ICOs issue is developing rapidly, and the volume of funding has only tripled The first half of 2017. These offerings are engaged in is not recognized as legal tender in most countries, and not necessarily a security, usually in private, but with some features very similar of an issuance of a security. This raises the question of whether these securities? If not, should they expand the definition of securities, should they be regulated as such, especially because of the fear of fraud and unnamed entrepreneurs and people, or should they be classified as an early sale of the product developed by the start-up? Digital currencies are gaining volume from the activities of many investors, and today they are a challenge for all regulators in the world. \"\n\nRecent examples, as published a week ago in the Israeli Bancor press, which raised $ 153 million in three hours for the development of a currency exchange protocol, and Gnosis, which raised 12.5 million dollars, $ 10 million for building an event forecasting platform, Brave, which raised $ 35 million in 24 seconds for browser development, Aragon, which raised $ 25 million within 15 minutes, a corporate decentralization project, etc. In recent months, -20 ICO issues each month From a regulatory point of view the question is whether the securities laws that were written for humans are at all prepared to handle this digital phenomenon, that has so many dimensions that the law did not anticipate? \"\n\n\"In today's world, if we are trying to analyze the digital currency issue in terms familiar to us, we can see that unlike in  securities, investors do not buy ownership in the company, and certainly not in a company that went through an orderly process of publishing a prospectus and reporting to the public before it became public. In ICO investors buy virtual currency which is created and controlled by the founders of the company [wrong, maybe by miners and validators - lzys], and which is supposed to finance a future project. Investors also do not purchase a financial instrument such as bonds that guarantee them interest payments and a fund at fixed times. According to this analysis, this is not a share or bond issue, but on the other hand, it is a solicitation of a passive financial investment for a large public of retail investors. This type of investment and the built-in risk, brings the situation closer to the issuance of securities and might justify imposing regulation. And how does the public see it? A few months ago, we conducted a survey of unregulated investments, among which we found that 61% of the public was exposed to an investment proposal including by digital means. The first question was what will be your response if you offer an investment opportunity One-time real estate project with a guaranteed annual return of 15% for 5 years? The most surprising result is that only 20% said they would refuse the offer. Another surprising result is that 45% of respondents said they would decide after consulting with friends and relatives. And only about 30% responded that they should consult with an investment advisor. The second question, if you were offered an immediate source of income and not dependent on using a simple trading system without fees, with the possibility of a return of 70% in any market situation, would you consider investing in it? Only 20% of the respondents said such a proposal would not be attractive to them. 67% of them thought this was an attractive offer to a large extent. These findings are especially surprising given the fact that most of the respondents who decided to invest were disappointed with the investment. These findings illustrate the need to think differently, to discover a greater degree of paternalism, and in this framework perhaps expand the definition of securities in general, and in the case of ICOs, in particular. This innovative field will occupy us a lot in the near future. We have to consider now if to be proactive about it before an event occurs in which Israeli investors will be hurt. \"",

We normalise the price of the coin by removing unit bias. This feature gives you a good view of the coins that look \"cheap\" but are probably not as cheap as they seem.\n\nE.g: We assume that XRP had the same circulating supply as BTC, and use the formula (XRP Supply / BTC supply * XRP Price) to remove unit bias. Under these conditions, XRP price would be $ 2,913. Matching by total supply, XRP price = $ 6,023\n\nIt's definitely not as cheap as it seemed.

I participated in a few ICOs (sold my ico bought eth at 14$ ouch :( ). \nI really think that there are lots of great projects out there but the one thing they all have in common is the fact that tokens which they will (or are) using on their platform have a high volatility - and that is i think a HUGE PROBLEM FOR MASS ADOPTION!\n\nLet's say for example a service like MobileGo or Matchpool - lets say they build an awesome platform - now the next thing is getting the Avarage Joe to use them. Dont you think there would be a problem for the avarage person to use them if the value of tokens is very variable?\nLets say Joe buys an x amount of MobileGo tokens to buy some games for his smartphone - dont you think it would be a problem for him if today he bought lets say 100 tokens for a 100$  and a week later he realizes that his tokens now have a value of 70$ thus permitting him to buy much less games (or in-game credits) than just a week ago? Dont you think he would (rightfully) be like \"yo fu*k this sh*t, i'm never touching this again)\n\nAnd here we are talking about tokens that have a low market cap so volatility can easily be eaven greater.\nBut lets put it in a best case scenario - lets say that the tokens have very little volatility in crypto terms - lets say that they are volatile like bitcoin - i still think that would still be too volatile for the normal avarage person.\n\nI asked that question in the matchpool slack channel and one of the team members answered basically saying that fiat currency has volatility too - but that is absolutely nothing compared to the crypto world.\n\nDont want to sound negative since i invested some of my money in some ICOs but i think tahat that's the common problem that they are all facing. What is you tought about it?\nThank you",

Please feel free to ask questions, the more the better.\n\nIt is best to visit our new website which describes what we do in more detail:  www.paramountico.com\n\nEssentially what we are trying to do is create a \"Hedge Fund\" in the cryptocurrency space. My partner and I have a vast amount of experience investing money in the equities and FX markets (I work for Royal Bank of Canada and my partner works for a Private Company called Just Energy). Our jobs entail investing a large sum of money which includes pension money from Manulife. Cryptocurrencies are something new to us but we are excited to get our toes wet, for the lack of a better word. Since ICOs and cryptocurrencies in general are only now being introduced to the mainstream, it comes with its own challenges, especially concerning security, liquidity, manipulation and transparency. It is also difficult for an average joe to perform research on companies that offer ICOs. Given our experience investing into equities and FX, we believe we have the right tools to perform proper research to increase our chances in finding ICOs that have true potential for growth.\n\nWe are planning on opening a hedge fund, Paramount ICO Capital LLC, which is structured as per below. The fund will be an ICOs within itself, we are planning on issuing 100,000 coins in the first round (still in the process of figuring out the details) and using those funds to invest.\n\nICOs - 45%\nCryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ether) - 25%\nEquities - 30%\n\n1. ICOs - The nature of the fund is to search through various ICO offerings and find the ones with growth potential that will provide solid returns.\n\n2. Cryptocurrencies - Given our experience within the FX market, we believe we can use Bitcoins and Ether investments for short-term trading and hedging purposes.\n\n3. Equities - Equities are generally uncorrelated to the performance of cryptocurrencies and ICOs. Having 30% of the funds invested in equities will stabilize volatility, essentially providing a hedging mechanism, while also providing returns. \n\nThe above is a short description of what we are trying to do. Please ask any questions, post any comments or concerns you may have and we will do our best to answer all. Please view the original post submitted to bitcointalk.org <https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1989271.0>\n\nThank you,\nAnton & Paramveer\nCo-Founders and Fund Managers at Paramount ICO Capital LLC",

            "text": "It seems like a new ICO (Initial Coin Offering) launches every single day but what is an ICO? And should you get involved? Well the answer is a bit more difficult than just a simple yes or no.....\n \nFirstly an ICO, which stands for initial coin offering, is a way for blockchain start-ups to raise funds for a new cryptocurrency venture. Usually the ICO will offer early backers X number of tokens in exchange for fiat currency or a different cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. The funds you give them are then used towards the initiation or operation of the project.\n \nSo why would you do this?\n \nSimple answer! It's because you want to get in right at the start and hopefully watch your money grow enough to quit your job and retire on the moon! Ethereum is a great example of a blockchain start-up which began life as an ICO. Backers were offered 2000 \"Ether\" tokens, Ether is the native currency to the Ethereum blockchain, in exchange for 1 Bitcoin which at the time was approximately $600. So if you were lucky enough to invest in Ethereum back in 2014 it means your initial investment of $600 would now be worth approximately $430,000. Nice!!!\n \nSo with that said it seems simple doesn't it, you buy into an ICO, HODL.....then BOOM.....profits!! Well not exactly. Here's just a two of the major risks you need to consider before investing into any ICO & what you can do about it!\n \nScammers!\n \nDue to the cryprocurrency industry being largely unregulated, ICO's have been used by scammers and criminals as a vessel to acquire people's money or cryptocurrency. These scammers set up a simple website, attach a bogus white paper, make some outrageous claims which make the \"project\" sound amazing and voila! The money comes rolling in and honest investors like you end up with nothing to show for it so be careful!\n \nSpeculation!\n \nEssentially when you invest in an ICO, you're pretty much investing in nothing but an idea. It's really difficult to establish exactly what things to look for in order to determine if the ICO is legitimate. Even if the project is legitimate you have to be sure that the development team behind the project had the skills and competency to finish the project off. Understand that nearly 90% of new start-ups fail and there are no exceptions to cryptocurrency. Make sure you can only invest what you can afford to lose.\n \nSo what can I do to protect myself?\n \nThere\u2019s a hundred more risks to investing in ICO\u2019s and unfortunately people don\u2019t generally consider these either due to having a lack of knowledge or fear of missing out......Consider some of the following points before taking the leap.\n \n\u00b7         Does the ICO have a working prototype? It\u2019s like every start-up in the crypto-world is launching a white paper without a working prototype. This is a massive risk so look as to whether the product is working or not and more importantly what are the benefits of the technology.\n\u00b7         Is the ICO fund capped? Be wary of any ICO which is raising funds but doesn\u2019t stipulate how much they are looking to raise. This indicates that the project hasn\u2019t been very well thought through.\n\u00b7         Who are the people behind the ICO? Be aware that some ICO\u2019s have a huge amount of \u201cadvisors\u201d on their boards. Don\u2019t be fooled by this, instead look at who the founders are, look at who the developers are. Have they been involved in any shady ICO\u2019s before? What\u2019s their background? Do they have what it takes to see this project through?\n\u00b7         What is the community like? Does the ICO have a following on social media? Are the followers engaged?\n \nSome investors say to avoid ICO\u2019s altogether and there is probably a good argument to say this is decent advice. Truth is you MUST be a savvy investor if you want to profit from ICO\u2019s in the long run, this is not a crap shoot, and you don\u2019t have to gamble.\n \nCryptocurrency as a whole is worth over 40 billion dollars which is huge. However, it\u2019s nothing compared to the 66 trillion dollars currently in the stock market! We\u2019ve got a long way to go and there\u2019s no doubt that some of the most innovative blockchain idea\u2019s are just around the corner so it\u2019s time to get educated.\n \nIf you want to keep up to date with the latest ICO\u2019s then visit [www.theICONinja.com](www.theICONinja.com) today.

Main idea of project is fight back against some of the biggest problems of the \u201cold internet\u201d. \n\n**Those problems include**:\n\n- **Massive Data Breaches**. Traditional apps store user data in massive data silos. This gives hackers an easy \u2013 and enormous \u2013 target just waiting to be breached. Blockstack has a storage system that lets users bring their own storage providers and control their data. All data in this storage system is encrypted and can easily be shared between applications.\n\n- **Insecure Connections**. Traditional apps rarely provide truly secure connections. Blockstack\u2019s apps put you in control of your software. You load apps via a secure domain name system. The apps also live on your devices. This makes you independent from third parties, which keeps you safer.\n\n- **Platform Lock-in**. Traditional apps use digital keys to identify and authenticate. Users and developers are locked in and forced to use large monopoly platforms, which restricts innovation. Blockstack apps let you own your identity. The digital keys are seamlessly generated and kept on your device, letting you move freely between apps and control your online experience.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Blockstack** uses Bitcoin (after sale token **STX**) for simple peer-to-peer payments. Using Blockstack\u2019s P2P payment system, developers can charge users for downloads, subscriptions, and more in an efficient and affordable way.\n\n\u26aa\ufe0f **STX use cases**:\n\n- token enables a truly decentralized exchange of assets (without any trusted middlemen or exchanges).\n\n- token provide the ability to auction off namespaces so that namespaces aren\u2019t too expensive for typical buyers at the same time they aren\u2019t auctioned off too cheaply.\n\n- it\u2019s possible to send domain registration payments to a set of names/addresses (instead of burning the registration payments).\n\n- token provide a transparent mechanism for the stakeholders to vote on whether or not a move should take place and if so when.\n\n\u274c Don't miss new reports\u2757\ufe0f\n   \n\n\n\n\u2705 Join ICO Report in telegram \ud83d\udc49 @ICO_report",

This feature gives you a good view of the coins that look \"cheap\" but are probably not as cheap as they seem.\n\nE.g: We assume that ADA had the same circulating supply as BTC, and use the formula (ADA Supply / BTC supply * ADA Price) to remove unit bias. Under these conditions, ADA price would be $ 536. Matching by total supply, ADA price = $ 746\n\nIt's definitely not as cheap as it seemed.

            "text": "**Introducing Rhea Token**\n[Rhea](http://rheatoken.io/) is a revolutionary crypto-equity hybrid token.\nRhea's main mission is to create a clear synergy between the worlds of finance and cryptocurrencies. Through the Rhea Crypto20 - our capitalization weighted index, we will enable multiple ways of hedging, speculating and investing in the cryptocurrency market without holding any individual currency. The Rhea token will be used to buy and sell options on our platform or provide market liquidity for extra return. \nRhea aims to achieve a crypto-equity synergy by adopting the best features from both worlds. From financial markets we will take long-term value adding instruments, multiple ways of participation and dividends. From cryptocurrencies \u2013 bypassing burdensome regulations, fast and simple execution, as well as the opportunity to invest in exotic assets. Rhea is ERC-20 compliant and is built on the Ethereum blockchain. It is the means by which options trading will be executed on the platform and dividends will be paid out.\n\n**Transparency and Accountability**\nWe value transparency above all. Currently cryptomarkets are unregulated and ICOs are not obliged to provide any accountability or performance results to their investors. Although in the cryptocurrency world such regulations still do not exist, we still choose to integrate them in the core of our company by providing token holders multiple ways of tracking our performance through our accountability systems such as daily transaction volume on the entire platform and complete capital allocation breakdown.\n\n**Crypto20**\nIn contrast to equity markets, the world of cryptocurrencies currently has 2 major flaws \u2013 fragmentation and specific knowledge. Traditional markets are well structured and covered by multiple indices, which give investors a clear view of how they are performing and what the overall state of the market is. Most investors cannot fully understand all cryptocurrencies and are uncertain which one is the best. Investing through the Crypto20 will enable participants to bet on a market direction or to hedge their portfolios against volatility and unexpected risks. Our goal is for the Crypto20 index to become a benchmark of the cryptocurrency market. Options trading is how investors will take position on the index. Our goal is for the Crypto20 index to become a benchmark of the cryptocurrency market.\n\n**Dividend Payments**\nThe platform launch is planned for 15.03.2018 and additional features will be introduced in the following 3 months. Post launch, Rhea will pay out quarterly dividends to all token holders. They will be based on transaction costs revenue from options trading, before the subtraction of any expenses, such as operational and maintenance costs. The dividend payout ratio will range from 20% to 40%, depending on the success of the ICO. Once the payout ratio has been established it will remain the same in perpetuity. \n\n**ICO Campaign**\nThe token sale will commence on the 2nd October and conclude on 30th October. The campaign is divided into 5 rounds each with a different discount factor and we will be accepting only Ether contributions. The maximum available supply will be 50,000,000 tokens, of which 42,500,000 will be offered during the ICO at an initial price of 0.000814 ETH/RHEA or about 0.25$/RHEA. These funds will be used exclusively for developing the platform and all of its features. \nFailure to raise 100% of the required capital would result in the permanent reduction of the total supply of Rhea tokens. The burn model will keep the distribution pro-rata to the individual contributions made. This way we avoid two issues: us having more than 15% of the total supply and giving contributors an abnormal amount of Rhea tokens.\n\n**Bounty Campaign**\nThe bounty campaign starts on September 11th and will stop one day before the ICO\u2019s end \u2013 October 29th. 1% of the total contributions will be allocated for the bounty, or a maximum of 333,333.33 RHT \u2013 whichever is lower. There will be 5 sub-campaigns in descending order of importance \u2013 Bitcointalk, Twitter, Articles&Videos, Facebook and Translations. \n\n[Official Website!](http://www.rheatoken.io/)\n[WhitePaper!](http://rheatoken.io/documentation/WhitePaper.pdf)\n[BitcoinTalk!](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2152262.0)\n[Bounty Campaign!](https://medium.com/@rheatoken/rhea-bounty-campaign-57fccfe4b8e8)",

            "text": "These days ICOs have compelling advantages for entrepreneurs all over the world allowing cryptocurrency investors to make handsome returns. According to CBInsight statistics, 37 ICOs have been able to raise about $2 billion in 2017.\n\nBut why this ICO thing is so exciting?\n\nSeveral years ago no one really cared about ICOs and now they are one of the most powerful venture capital tools. ICO refers to Initial Coin Offering, which is basically the first public sale of a \"cryptocurrency\" (a currency based on information technology), like Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nThere has already been a huge number of amazing platforms and promising start-ups taking part in ICO, but we, at BitRent, aim to reach the impossible and introduce a Blockchain construction platform that will provide absolute transparency in the disrupt industry. ICO is just the first step on the way to improve and simplify all construction operations.\n\n**BitRent's Solution**\n\nBitRent provides a complex solution by combining modern technologies - Blockchain, RFID, BIM, Smart Contracts - with a unique objective to solve all existing construction industry issues once and for all.\n\n**Bitcoins & Blockchains**\n\nBitcoin is a form of electronic money, often managed by a blockchain. A blockchain is a public ledger that records bitcoin and ethereum transactions and protects them. When blockchains of multiple companies are linked together, it leads to the formation of a hyperledger. The hyperledger platform brings together all open source blockchains and related tools. It is one of the so-called alternative blockchains, supporting blockchain-based distributed ledgers across industries.\n\n**BIM**\n\nBIM decisions are meant for creating and collecting information about the building under construction at any stage of its existence.This technology allows to reproduce an accurate, in all parameters, model on computers and other devices.\nThe use of BIM facilitates designing processes at all stages, performs analysis as well as control of all construction activities. BIM technology takes into consideration all geometrical features of a building and all its structural elements. Such a complete model makes it possible to see all potential outcomes during construction in advance, assess efficiency rate, compare alternative options in order to focus on the best one and make an accurate schedule of all construction stages.\n\n**RFID technology** \n\nOne of the most promising directions for RFID systems' development is their use in construction. First of all, RFID tags are placed on all objects used during the building process. Afterwards, these tags are being read in real time, which means that we can track the building process online.\n\nThe primary benefit of such technology is timely notifications as well as absence of human factor. Investors will no longer need to rely on other people's reports or keep track of the project themselves. In the case of below-proof issues or repairing of damaged objects on the construction site, these faults will be traced with up-to- the-second accuracy, and, at best, fixed immediately upon their appearance.\n\n**Smart contracts**\n\nSmart contracts system is regarded as the main technology behind the project, which forms the basis of the whole project. Smart contracts system, built on blockchain technology, allows storing of reliable information on all construction stages and deals made. Apart from transparency of the process that strengthens trust among deal agents, smart-contracts significantly speed up the process due to the fact that the decentralized system excludes participation of any contracting officers.\n\n**ICO**\n\nThe RNT tokens are designed to be used as a means of payment for BitRent platform. With the help of them, the owner of tokens can enclose them in the real estate and receive dividends from it. All operations performed with the token on site are recorded within blockchain through smart-contracts.\n\nIn total, BitRent will issue 1 billion tokens, with 100 million to remain within the company. 200 million tokens to be issued during Presale period.\n\nAll tokens holders are empowered to purchase real estate items located on BitRent platform. Tokens are liquid, that\u2019s why an investor should be 100% confident about the return of funds. The value of a token may increase depending on the platform\u2019s capitalization. \n\nTaking into account the fact that the amount of tokens is fixed and immune to inflation, the demand for them will certainly increase. In this case, all investors will definitely receive extra benefits. \n\nToken holders can sell their tokens to BitRent platform or platform\u2019s customers at a price higher than that when tokens were purchased during the ICO phase.\n\nMark the date!\n\nPreSale\u200a\u2014\u200a24 November, 2017\nICO\u200a\u2014\u200a1 December, 2017\n\nIco Trackers:\n\t\tCoinschedule;\n\t\tSMITH + CROWN;\n\t\tICO Tracker;\n\t\tRateI.CO;\n\t\tICO Bench;\n\t\tICOadvert\n\t\tIcoAlert\n\t\tICO Countdown\n\n\n**Strategy**\n\nAccording to BitRent\u2019s business plan, the platform will be launched in any case, even if the required amount of funds is not raised.\nBitRent has an ultimate goal, which is focused on the development of the platform that offers reliable investment opportunities and produces the highest profit via transparent, safe and efficient operations within construction industry.\n\nYou may find more information here: [website link](https://bitrent.io/)",

            "text": "Larson&Holz, an international group of companies, presented its innovative project \u2013 crypto-broker LH-Crypto, \u2013 at the Annual Business Congress in Moscow. \n\nIt seems that the event planners of the Annual Business Congress with Mikhail Hazin have tried to boil the ocean. The number of topics for discussion and their profundity were astounding. It was hard to believe that three days would be enough to speculate on: world\u2019s major currencies prospects, US economy future, enlarging business profits in the times of crisis, sensible investment tactics, the phenomenon of cryptocurrencies which is gaining more and more popularity nowadays, etc. \n\nHowever, when Mikhail Hazin and Jan Art, the famous experts, come on the stage, any trickiest challenge seems not that unsolvable at all. \n\nOne of the leading economists (macroeconomists) of Russia in his characteristic vivid manner gave a not-so-bright forecast for the American and global economy and prophesied for the forthcoming reshaping of economic models; he also stated the urging need to seek and implement new ideas. \n\n\u201cThe global economy cannot survive on the same principles which have been raising it up for the past forty years. Giving people money and hoping for the respective increase in demand is a no go anymore. The developed countries\u2019 population is so deep in depth that some households in the USA cannot cater their credits, not speaking about closing them. The average spending capacity of the US population is on the 1958 level.\u201d said Mr. Hazin. \nThis brings us to a question: what would the management system be after the fundamental changes? According to the economist, there already is an answer: cryptocurrencies. They owe their existence and popularity to the fact that for the past decades the financial system has been coming apart at the seams and the information on the real state of events is more available to people. \n\nVladimir Kuzovlev, Larson&Holz expert, has supported the statement that cryptocurrencies are worth paying attention to. At the very beginning of his speech he claimed that cryptocurrencies in general and bitcoin in particular have long since become real investment instruments, just as fiat currencies, oil or gold. Regarding technical analysis, a popular tool among traders, graphs of several cryptocurrencies look so appealing that it makes investors come to this market again and again. \n\nOleg Dmitriev, an independent specialist from Larson&Holz group, focused attention on how fast cryptocurrencies are evolving, upgrading the convenience of use and its status. \n\n\u201cUntil recently about a half of what we were talking about could become a reason for criminal investigation, yet today operations with cryptocurrencies are absolutely normal, their invasion to the real world and their synergy with fiat currencies is ever growing\u201d stated Mr. Dmitriev. \n\nCurrently there are 800 cryptocurrencies, their number is growing (each week there are approximately 2,5 new placements). Due to this there comes a reasonable question: how long will cryptocurrencies survive? All the participants and experts have agreed upon one opinion that there is no place for all 800 cryptocurrencies or more; so there will be some sort of fast natural selection; several dozens (maybe a hundred) of the most powerful, resilient and popular cryptocurrencies will stay and will later represent the whole market. \n\nNaturally, the next speech was given by Alexandr Smirnoff, the Head of the Trading Operations and Audit Department of the brokerage house L&H, a top-20 trading guild leader and a famous specialist in market exchange technologies and financial consulting. Mr Smirnoff presented the revolutionary project LH Crypto. \nIt\u2019s not just another exchange platform that Larson&Holz is creating, it starts a fully-featured crypto-broker; it means that from now on the company\u2019s clients will be able to have their accounts not only in USD and EUR, but in cryptocurrencies as well, and make the same operations as with fiat currencies. This step will radically change the broker\u2019s economy, it will open new markets and new regions, where local laws had hindered Forex market development before. \n\nLH Crypto will allow the broker to make settlements with China, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, many Arab countries; what is more, there is no need to open real representative offices in any of these countries, therefore there is no need to acquire license for operational activity, which will reduce the operational expenses from 6% to 1%. \nThe company launches an ICO to support this project in the autumn 2017; Larson&Holz will release LHCoin tokens with guaranteed (written in the smart contract) profitability of more than 20%. Moreover, LHCoin holders will benefit from programmes which provide additional profits. CASHBACK Program is a monthly payback to token holders as a fixed proportion from the operational activity of the company. Early Bird Bonus an effective instrument to support and reward first investors by means of price growth for the following investors. \n\n\u201cWe presume that during the PRE ICO and the ICO itself we will manage to attract around 5-10 mln USD, but we won\u2019t be surprised if the interest is higher, for we do offer an innovative product\u201d said Alexandr Smirnoff. \nPRE ICO will start on the 30th of October, ICO \u2013 a month later.

Token Report is a tokenized revision of the Wall Street financial research model, designed for this community. Its token mechanics are designed to grow with the crypto investor community and preserve investor edge for subscribers as the market expands and grows more complex. \n\n* Please visit our website for a live demo of our product, Token Clarity: http://tokenreport.com\n* Watch this video to hear directly from some of our team members and learn more about how we view this market. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pin9zIdJdAg\n* And, ask us a question in our Telegram forum: https://t.me/joinchat/DtuO-A237efEOnxD1BKy6g\n\n\n**THE MARKET, AS WE SEE IT**\n\nEthereum\u2019s network has become the blockchain of choice for developers of new tokenized projects. Querying the Ethereum network shows that, as of the second half of 2017, approximately 500,000 Ethereum addresses had transacted in at least one token. Of these, approximately 40,000 had bought or sold three or more. Many diversified buyers hold multiple addresses. Nonetheless, we have used this number to make a wide-angle estimate of the number of diversified token investors--the total addressable market for Token Report  in the second half of 2017.\n\nMany observers have compared the rise of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency to the emergence of the internet in the late 1990s. From 1995 to 1996, the [number of online trading accounts](http://web.mit.edu/smadnick/www/wp2/2000-02-SWP%234104.pdf) quadrupled. The following year, it grew by 167 percent. The rate of growth continued to cool each following year, settling to a modest 43 percent rate of growth between 1999 and 2000. If cryptocurrency trading grows at a similar pace, Token Report\u2019s total addressable market of diversified crypto investors will grow to 735,000 by 2020.\n\n\n**OUR PRODUCTS**\n\nWe have built what we believe to be the world\u2019s largest database of verified information on ICOs and a research system that is capable of covering nearly every tokenization that emerges.

However, why wouldn't they just choose to create everything running with BTC?\n\nIn the future, what I see with ICOs are hundreds of thousands of different tokens, one for each service.

            "text": "Just spent some time reading up on the upcoming Quantstamp ico. I honestly think it's worth your time to research. Here are my thoughts. \n\nTheir project has reminded me of the need to maintain vigilance in the wake of the epic Ethereum Dao hack, and the great shared cost of lack of said vigilance. There has already been and most likely will continute to be countless scams and hacks in this brave new world of crypto-land. Crypto is not called the Wild West for nothing. There is a full continuum of all sorts of actors, with different selfish motives. All types of opportunists and hackers; white hats, black hats, and strangely enough, grey hats.\n\nThis is where Quantstamp comes in. They have an ambitious goal of becoming the standard, scalable and effective solution for auditing all smart contracts on the Ethereum network. I believe in their mission, which is the championing of increased proper and reliable smartcontract auditing; manual with incentives at first and then as automated as possible. I believe increased smart-contract auditing has the potential to create a positive feedback loop that may benefit cryptocurrency eco-system on a systematic level, and I will explain why.\n\nAs we all know, ethereum is turning-complete while bitcoin is not. This is a double-edged sword; a gift and a curse. For every breakthrough, there is a set-back. 2 steps forward, 1 step back. For every few great innovations, there are an occasional catastrophic dismal failures; all because someone didn't dot their i's and cross their t's. If Quantstamp truly achieved it's goals with auditing, it would allow us can basically negate all of the downside risk associated with turing completeness and smart contracts but still exploit all of the wonderful upsides; and it would allow us to lock in far greater value in the crypto system. If we can limit the downside risk of turing completeness and smart-contracts, then we can fully unlock the full potential of the blockchain. The more audited that can be eventually automated, the higher the volume of unexploitable smart-contracts are running live, the greater the value that these smartcontracts will store on mass, in the long-run. This helps create another positive feedback in the community. We get to our shared end destination of crypto world domination faster and safer. Everybody wins.\n\nThefts due to exploited smartcontracts which were poorly audited or in some cases, not audited at all, are a burden that the entire cryptocurrency eco-system must bare. In the end, every single theft, big and small that takes place, cumulatively adds to the suppressed price (stolen funds tumbled and sold), an increased threat of heavy-handed regulation and even a loss of innovative talent. The value of our blockchains is worth more according to a network effect; every single additional participate adds more value than before. However every individual that is burned financially and leaves the network forever, further reduces the value of the network overall. This also can have far greater unintended consequences and repercussions; if regulators are forced to act due to too many thefts as a result of exploited un-audited smart-contracts, then they may stifle innovation and set us back years.\n\nAdditionally to the above points, we do not want any more promising blockchain companies (such as slock.it) to be utterly wiped out and destroyed because they accidentally and inadvertently left a small error in a smart contract; which was written by a human in good faith and meant for a machine to read. We need a fix to combat this. Again, us humans, we understand what we wish to write, but it's easy for a machine to misinterpret or for us to miscommunicate to the machine. \n\nI believe Quantstamp is very much needed and is a step in the right direction for this community. It helps us limit the downside risk of smart-contracts and turing-completeness, which in turn will allow us to unlock the full potential of the blockchain in the long-run. \n\nIn closing, it will help prevent thefts due to exploits, before they even happen. Prevention is better than cure. This movement has the potential to increase value for the entire network by protecting our network effect and reducing the threat of heavy regulation by our own self-regulating with increased auditing. Furthermore, Quantstamp's initative has the potential to prevent promising new infant blockchain infants from getting blown up before they even get started. Their mission will help protect the vulnerable before they can defend themselves, and this will benefit the entire eco-system as a whole. I think the crypto community should get behind this effort, and support Quantstamp.\n",

            "text": "The rapid increase of blockchain projects and ICOs leads to their getting encrusted with infrastructure. New services emerge so quickly that some of them don\u2019t even have the time to create their own websites, nor do they need to be advertised: all the names and contacts are passed on by word of mouth, and further corrections and debugging are carried out through real users\u2019 feedback.    \n*Here are some of the latest projects that can be extremely useful for every ICO.*\n\n**Tokenator.io**\nThis is a so-called \u201cgroupon for ICOs\u201d, a service which allows investors to buy tokens of blockchain projects holding ICOs with a significant discount and, most importantly, for an exceedingly small price (0.1 ETH or 0.005 BTC). For ICO organizers, Tokenator is a chance to get yet another \u201cwhale\u201d with a big check, and a great marketing tool. The service actively promotes and advertises all of its sales and offers, thus increasing your project\u2019s visibility and allowing it to stand out among hundreds of ongoing ICOs. Tokenator does make interest on the money raised by the service, but they say that token sales and \u201cbest deals\u201d are selected by a group of experts, and not every ICO can launch an offer on Tokenator.\n\n**ICOForce.io**\nThis is a bookbuilding platform that helps collect purchase orders and control the transferring of tokens to your wallet. ICOForce includes easy-to-use tools to control each stage of ICO (pre-sale, sale, etc.) as well as minimum purchase amount and bonuses on each stage.  \nCryptocurrency transferring can be carried out through external services using smart contracts (if an ICO permits) or through ICOForce (ETH/BTC/LTC). What\u2019s particularly important is that besides offering pattern solutions, the developers of ICOForce customize the platform according to a certain ICO: that involves design adaptation, integration with a lending platform, interactions with smart contracts, etc. In addition to that, the price is quite reasonable: the basic features package will cost you only 10BTC.\n\n**Tokenhost.io**\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrency, there\u2019s no need to say how vitally important safety is: the amount of cryptocurrency that has been stolen is uncountable. One can tell from experience that DDoS attacks start once the token sales begin, so start making provision for a rainy day right now and do not cut corners on safety. \nTokenhost offers a comprehensive solution for the problem of safety tailored to the specific challenges of ICOs: a secure, fault-tolerant hosting for blockchain startups with 24/7 support.  The project is equipped with Qrator, a widely-known Russian service for countering DDoS attacks. The clients of Tokenhost include TokenStars, Jincor, United Traders. The cost of the hosting depends on the complexity of a project and starts from 150 000 rubles per month.\n\n**Coinpayments.net**\nThis is a payment gateway that allows ICO organizers to accept over 75 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoins, Ethereum, and Litecoins. You can accept all of the supported coins or just one. Coinpayments is one of the largest payment platforms which unites 360 000 vendors all over the world. It has a relatively simple and easy-to-use API with instant payment notifications. The features include apps for Android and iOS, multi-coin wallet, auto conversion of certain cryptocurrencies, fiat settlements for the USA citizens, etc. The commission fee is only 0,05%, for urgent payments + coin TX fee.   \n\n**Link**\nThis is a SaaS platform that keeps you compliant with Anti-Money Laundering  requirements and Know Your Customer policies. Link integrates with existing systems for a streamlined, automated workflow.  The solution includes data collection and document verification, keeping one\u2019s projects in compliance with the requirements of different jurisdictions, and guaranteed safety of all personal data. The service has a free 30-day trial. \n\nI do not claim to have embraced all the projects or been super-objective, but I hope this selection comes in handy for ICO organizers and others! Please share other useful tools in the comments!",

They have no interest in allowing people to invest the amount they want, my guess is to avoid any investment amount being too big so they can be pursued legally afterwards when they run with the money.",

Of course they are legit and arn't just going to run away to the bahamas with their money now, so they set to work and make their product within 1 year and release it. the product is amazing and incredible and now SAC is getting traded around for $800 per coin cus its just that bananas. \n\nOk but what i don't understand is, what is the point of the coin now? how is it in any way related to the project? the project could be super successful and make loads of money, but what does that have to do with the people who have some SAC. Sure the investors could make money if they sold their coin to some other idiot who wants to buy it, but what is the value of the coin itself at this point? people could just be trading it around, assuming that the value of it is somewhat proportional to the value of the project/product itself, when there could in theory be no relation at all? \n\nany help revealing where my complete lack of understanding lies is much appreciated.

The price of the stock goes up because people speculate on Alibaba and go nuts when it reports good news.\n\nSNAP, while actually owning a piece of the company via stock, you have 0 voting rights so it's basically like not owning it at all. The price of the stock tracks the company's progress and again, when people like the news, the stock goes higher because demand increases and people want to own it.\n\nAny stock, for the average investor, is simply a company tracking vehicle unless it pays dividends. There are some ICO coins that pay dividends as well.\n\nLike all \"investments,\" they only go up because more people want them. Simple as that. Digital tokens are no different. You could argue that there's intrinsic value in things like gold, etc., however, very few people actually purchase such investments with plans on using the actual asset for something other than speculation.",

            "text": "*Vitalik Buterin has lately been the talk of the town. The only one, who is even more famous that he is \u2014 Satoshi Nakamoto.The blockchain genius, ex-teen prodigy programmer (he grew up...) and the current crypto action hero, the creator of Ethereum, a 23-year-old skinny millennial with dual citizenship (Canada and Russia), who is a resident of Singapore for the time being*. \n\nVitalik was born in Kolomna, Russia on the 31st of January 1994, and in 1999 his parents moved to Canada. They did not leave him behind ofc. :D\nHis digital acumen was shown first in Russia: Dmitry Buterin \u2014 his father \u2014 told that his son was toying with Excel spreadsheets at the tender age of 4 instead of watching Sesame Street. At the age of seven Vitalik had an imaginary universe inhabited by bunnies, which was governed by very strict formulas. His early life was filled with math, charts and calculations. Ten year old boy could code in C++ \u2014 he was a classic nerd of the early noughties...\n\nEven though he was a quiet boy you would not put him for a model child for those mums and dads who wedge their kids into colleges. Fresher Vitalik dropped out of University of Waterloo to completely devote himself to Blockchain. For starters, he went from Canada to Israel and then to Amsterdam and San Francisco. Then there was Switzerland with the Canton of Zug, where, in the world-renowned Crypto Valley, the world-famous Ethereum Foundation headquarters is now based. \n \nTo date, the young dropout is an example of a remarkable career \u2014 he became involved with Blockchain and Bitcoin in 2011, and in 2017 he got the 10th place in Fortune magazine's 40 Under 40 and was highlighted in Forbes magazine's list of successful businessmen under 30. \nHe is fluent not only in Russian, English, German, but also in the Chinese language, which comes in handy during his business trips to China. The doors of the most influential people are always wide open for him \u2014 from Bank Directors to Presidents. Influential people all around the world treat him with respect and heed his advice!\n\nAt the end of September 2017 Vitalik said that Blockchain technology will wrest a significant market share from payment systems (Visa, PayPal, Mastercard, etc.) and similar financial institutions in the very near future. According to Vitalik the majority of cryptocurrency community is busy making Blockchain technology even more secure. \nAt the moment engineering part of applications is quite vulnerable \u2014 hence impaired distribution in the Network. Let us not forget about the occasions when hackers got away with loads of crypto, e.g. DAO attack. \n \nLandscape of the international financial market will radically change as soon as programmers and cryptographers eliminate security issues. \nMany of us remember that on the 25th of June 2017 there was a deafening buzz about an unexpected death of Vitalik. It happen completely out of blue \u2014 some overzealous rogue actors from 4chan (who thought they could stoop so low ;D) even hurried to Wikipedia to edit his article: \n\u201cButerin was a Russian-Canadian programmer\", etc. \nThat hoax brought down Ethereum by 14.5%.\n \nAnd only Vitalik's tweet, where he posed with the last ether transaction, pacified the international community \u2014 Ethereum rate stabilized and actually ascended the new all-time peak in November, 2017. But\u2026 that is beyond the point. \n\nOne might muse who would benefit from Vitalik's death...\nI guess the Eight Families or the owners of payment systems, starting with VISA as the most influential one... Who else might feel that programmer prodigy has crossed their path? Numerous ICO scammers \u2014 he repeatedly spoke against numerous ICOs and stated that only 10% of them are legit. As Vitalik rightfully esteems a great deal of ICOs and ITOs are the breeding pools for scammers. So the people who produce scam ICO and HYIP-projects might \"hodl\" a grudge against him! He called Bitconnecta Ponzi scheme... \n\nAs for personal motives for Vitalik's murder... they are truly tough to uncover! In my opinion he is as harmless as the day is long and would not hurt a fly. In fact, what do we know about the private life of one the most famous 23-year-old programmer boys in the world? The web search engines cannot find any information on his mother. And we only know that his father is a programmer and has recently founded a Blockgeeks Lab blockchain startup.\n\nA-a-and there is no information about his girlfriend or fianc\u00e9e.\n That is, neither Vitalik disclosed any information about his marital arrangements, nor any lady has made a startler... Capital magazine's journalist asked a blunt question and got this response: \n\"I think I'd rather pass on my ideas than my genetic material. If my blog is read by 10,000 people you could say that I have 10,000 children.\u201d \nSo a jealousy-fueled murder is probably a long shot!\n\nIn the pictures we always see him with his bros. One might wonder if that is just a bromance not something with the rainbow colours...\n \nWe also know that he is a green tea drinker. So, apparently, we are unlikely to read newsreports about his drunken brawls, which are usual for celebrities of his caliber. \nI doubt he is or has ever been a member of Abstinence Leagues, I bet he would rather code than inhale, snort, sniff, inject, booze or adulterize! \n \nSo I would wish Vitalik longevity and luck in all his endeavours, especially in Akasha \u2014 a decentralized social network project, based on Ethereum and IFPS!\n\nAuthor: Dickinson-Junior\n",

            "text": "The Securities and Exchange Commission roiled the blockchain industry last week when it announced that so-called Initial Coin Offerings are considered securities offerings. While some firms are embracing a strategy of open defiance, vowing to push ahead with their planned ICOs without registering them, at least one former innovator in the blockchain arena sees the new rulings as a boon for its nascent cryptoasset trading platform, according to CoinDesk.\n\nOverstock.com, one of the first major US companies to embrace blockchain technology, believes the regulations could drive business to its cryptoasset trading platform known as T-0. Overstock cemented its status as a blockchain innovator back in December 2015 when it raised $2 million by offering a small tranche of Overstock corporate bonds on its platform. The offering, which received approval from regulators, created the first blockchain-based financial securities to trade in the US.\n\nSince then, the company has been quietly building out its platform while waiting for US regulators to create a framework for legally offering and trading blockchain securities. And now the day it has long been waiting for has finally arrived, according to CoinDesk.\n\u201c\u2026earlier this week, t\u00d8 got the news it had been waiting for when the SEC finally published the results of a landmark report in which it clearly laid out its rationale for why some tokens are still securities.\nMoreover, the report clarified that, once a token issued in an ICO has been deemed a security, only national securities exchanges like Nasdaq and some alternative trading systems (ATSs) are permitted to be involved in the trading.\u201d\nOverstock.com started building its T-0 blockchain-based trading platform in the spring of 2015, when it purchased a stake in an alternative trading system. Now, the company believes its system is ready for the mass market, and hopes to receive permission from the SEC to traffic in ICOs in the coming months.\n\u201cMoreover, the report clarified that, once a token issued in an ICO has been deemed a security, only national securities exchanges like Nasdaq and some alternative trading systems (ATSs) are permitted to be involved in the trading.\u201d    \nAccording to CoinDesk, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne has long hoped to build a platform that would allow trading in stocks and bonds backed by the blockchain. The platform\u2019s name, T-0, is derived from Byrne\u2019s claim that blockchain-backed transactions are inherently superior to the current system because, in theory, these trades will settle instantly, instead of taking up to three days to clear.\nHowever, many competitors, including some of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions, are quickly catching. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs was awarded a patent for its own crypto trading system called \u201cSETLCoin.\u201d  \nThose who are only now becoming acquainted with Byrne\u2019s story might wonder: What inspired a guy who built a billion-dollar business selling furniture and other household goods to try and revolutionize how financial securities are traded?\nByrne was initially inspired to try and disrupt the world of high finance after Overstock was nearly destroyed by \u201cnaked\u201d short sellers, or speculators who sell a company\u2019s shares short without first procuring the securities. The incident inspired Byrne to use the blockchain to cut out everyone who stood in the way of buyers and sellers, as CoinDesk explains.\nStill, the question of whether it\u2019s legal to trade blockchain-based stocks and bonds remains murky. However, there\u2019s been at least one important breakthrough recently. Last month, the Delaware legislature passed a landmark amendment that opened the door to blockchain-backed stock trading on a massive scale \u2013 a decision that could significantly impact Overstock\u2019s business.\n\u201cOne possible explanation for the relatively few compliant blockchain capital raises is uncertainty about the legality of recording stock ownership on a distributed ledger, according to Andrea Tinianow, founder and director of the state-run Delaware Blockchain Initiative.\nUsing technology that t\u00d8's parent company invested in last week, made by New York-based Symbiont, Delaware has just signed into law a series of amendments that Tinianow has said will remove much of that uncertainly for firms incorporated in her state.\n\"We've got the regulatory framework for blockchain shares,\" said Tinianow. \"Now the SEC is coming in with federal guidance and it\u2019s a natural fit.\"\nIn another major regulatory accomplishment, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission recently approved the creation of the first clearinghouse for cryptocurrency options, a decision that could entice sophisticated investors like hedge funds and CTAs to increase their exposure to bitcoin, as we reported earlier this month.\n\u201cUS regulators aren\u2019t yet comfortable with bitcoin ETFs (although a quad-levered S&P ETF is just fine for mom and pop), but apparently options and swaps are another story. This week, the CFTC took a bold step forward in terms of granting institutional investors access to the bitcoin market, approving the creation of the first SEF or Swap Execution Facility. Previously, traders who wished to place bets in bitcoin derivatives markets were forced to operate in markets that were strictly OTC. But now the agency has issued a registration order to LedgerX, granting it status with the CFTC as a Swap Execution Facility, in the process approving bitcoin options trading.\u201d\nWhile Overstock has a long history of working with regulators, some companies are effectively choosing to rebel against the SEC\u2019s ruling that all ICOs marketed in the US must be registered, according to Reuters.\n\u201cTechnology companies looking to raise money by issuing digital coins are moving forward with their plans despite a U.S. regulator's decision that their offerings may be subject to tough securities laws.\nOn Tuesday, the SEC decided that tokens issued through the ICOs can be considered securities, meaning they would fall under laws that require disclosures and are subject to regulatory scrutiny to protect investors, unless a \"valid exemption\" applies.\n \nSome industry participants and analysts had thought such a decision would have a chilling effect on the ICO market. But 20 new ICOs were announced since the SEC's decision, with more than 120 scheduled to launch this year, according to ICO tracker tokendata.io.\n\nRepresentatives of Rivetz and ICOBox, which plan to launch tokens over the next few weeks, told Reuters they are pushing through with their offerings.\u201d\nAccording to Reuters, ICOs have raised more than $1 billion in capital this year as companies launched more than 900 new coins.\n\n\"We were kind of annoyed when these ICOs started taking off. They weren't getting approval, it was the Wild West. We thought long and hard about doing our own ICO ... But we held off, going down the regulatory road,\" T-0 President Joseph Cammarata told CoinDesk.\n\nICOs are similar in principal to stock offerings in that investors bid up the price of tokens associated with companies they believe will grow profits. However, the paucity of information about many of these companies \u2013 some of which have been unmitigated frauds that essentially took investors\u2019 money and ran - makes valuing them nearly impossible.\n\nHackers have plagued the cryptocurrency investment community since its early days, so it\u2019s little surprise that they\u2019re already started looting ICOs \u2013 a security problem that could potentially drive more customers to OverStock\u2019s platform if it can provide enhanced security. As we reported earlier this month, hackers stole $7 million in investors\u2019 funds from CoinDash, a blockchain startup focusing on \"cryptocurrency social trading and portfolio management platforms.\u201d Bloomberg notes that hackers have stolen more than $40 million from ICOs.\n\n",

However, we are not selling stakes in the company, we are selling stakes in the game, which has already been implemented and is ready to run. In this sense there's no trust or risk involved.\n\nThe idea is that people will fill the jackpot (333 ETH to start the game), and then the whole world will compete to grab the jackpot by placing small bids. They will place tons of bids because the last one to bid until time runs out will win it all, nobody will want someone else to get it when it could be them. So it's going to be one big and long rat race.\n\nThat huge amount of small bids will inflate the jackpot even further, but the interesting part is that those who invested in the jackpot will be getting a share of all those bids as well, all the time.\n\nThe end-game will be even funnier: the bid price will grow up to very substantial numbers like 0.1 ETH and so on, so it will be expensive to bid ether. But the jackpot investors will be able to bid their tokens they got cheap during the jackpot collection ICO instead of ether.\n\nSince one token = one bid by price, and the price is growing, so does the price of the token. The system will allow players to re-sell their tokens to others during the game at ever growing price, as well.\n\nOnce again: it's not an ICO for a future project. The project is here and it's ready, we are collecting the money for the prize fund necessary to kick-start it. And it will start automatically once the jackpot of 333 ETH is accumulated. \n\nI'm a part of the dev team, so i'll be happy to answer all your questions!",

They get results of failed attempts by people to claim the prize. And there'll be a whole lot of those. Note that they don't get new investors' investments (ponzi!), but money generated by non-investor players. This is s major difference. This is comparable to having a stake in a casino where you get what house gets from an honest game.\n\n2. The token's price is skyrocketing, too. But it does so because one token substitutes one bid, and a bid's price grows. Bid's price is backed by the attractiveness of the jackpot, so is the token. The tokens are free tickets to claim jackpot, the more you have the more chances you have.\n\n3. Since the token's price is skyrocketing, and it's possible to buy the tokens during the game, why not re-sell them to new players? The contract facilitates that.\n\nSo overall it's more like buying a casino's shares, rather than being a part of a ponzi. Item \"3\" smells ponzi, but it's only one aspect. And besides, what games involving money don't?\n\nThe devs' position is illustrated in all charts: devs benefit along with investors by getting a share too. Just like a casino would.",

Speaking with TruNews correspondent Edward Szall at the 2018 Blockchain Event in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Mr. Nerayoff also goes into detail about what a security token is, how the Wall Street elite may respond to the delisting of 2,000 companies from the NASDAQ and the replacement of their jobs, and how tZero plans to protect its users against hacking.",

Well, we\u2019re a group of bored college students and decided to push the craze to the next level by putting virtual tulips on the Ethereum blockchain!\n\nRight now, we have an initial release where you can buy \u201cGen-0\u201d tulips. Each time you buy a seed, you\u2019ll get a random tulip from over 1000 possible ones with varying rarity. As of now, there isn\u2019t really a general theme, but we have lots of zany ideas that we\u2019ll be releasing soon. We'll be sure to give Gen-0 a buff compared to future generations! You can read more about Gen-0 and rarities here.\n\nAs for a more general roadmap, we\u2019re working on getting trading out ASAP, and we can\u2019t wait to release our flagship feature--tulip battles.\n\nYup! You heard that right--we\u2019re going to be adding tulip battles, because no Ethereum dapp is complete without battling. The possibilities with the Ethereum blockchain are endless!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in playing, come on over to https://www.ethertulips.com/! And if you have any questions or whatnot, please don\u2019t hesitate to email us at contact@ethertulips.com. You can also head on over to r/ethertulips to chat with us.\n\ntl;dr mit students on break got bored, we decided to make a dapp parodying recent \"games\" and the whole \u201ccryptocurrency bubble\u201d - hope you enjoy the fun and don't gamble your life savings on this :)\n\ncontract source code: https://etherscan.io/address/0x995020804986274763df9deb0296b754f2659ca1#code",

According to experts, the development of blockchain technologies is hindered by the fact that not all people fully understand how to use it and do not see the potential of it. Businesses need to pay attention to how blockchain technology can eliminate intermediaries and make business processes more transparent.\n\n\u2014 Blockchain is able to make your business more efficient. We already have two working and actively developing companies in the field of public Wi-Fi: Radius Wi-Fi, providing Wi-Fi hotspot solutions on a subscription basis with an integrated user identification, and Adrenta, an automated advertising platform for campaigns in public Wi-Fi networks. Having assessed the possibilities of blockchain-technology, we have created the World Wi-Fi project, a decentralized Wi-Fi network,-says Yan Sepiashvili, Co-founder of World Wi-Fi.\n\nThe authorities of St. Petersburg are also interested in the maximum development of new technologies and application of blockchain-solutions at the state level. According to representatives of the authorities, the introduction of blockchain technologies has an opportunity to free huge budget and technical resources, that can be used more efficiently by distributing part of the load on the free computing power of millions of network users.\n\n\nMartynov, Sepiashvili and Abubakarov also discussed the issue of Internet development in general and providing access to public services online in particular. World Wi-Fi intends to take an active part in creating favorable conditions for the residents of major cities and businessmen all over the world. The deployment of Wi-Fi network will not require large-scale construction works, as the network is based on private and public Internet routers.\n\nVladislav Martynov initiated a big event to be held in collaboration with\u00a0Ethereum\u00a0Foundation in autumn, 2018 in Saint-Petersburg. The participants of the meeting supported the idea to gather blockchain experts, representatives of the Internet industry and state authorities in one place. The event will be devoted to the development of blockchain technologies and unite more than 10 000 participants.\n\nFrom r/worldwifi",

            "text": "**Introduction to Elrond**\n\nElrond Network is a novel blockchain architecture designed for practical scalability through Adaptive State Sharding and Secure Proof of Stake (SPoS). Their solution offers scalability while preserving security and decentralization.\n\nOn the other hand, it also ensures large-scale efficiency and sustainability through the elimination of intensive PoW energy and computational waste.\n\nThey also offer interoperability which is essential for the future of the blockchain ecosystem, which is why they intend for Elrond to be EVM-compliant and cross-chain interoperable.\n\n \n\n**Problem**\n\nScalability is a challenge that the largest names in the crypto industry are struggling to deal with. According to Elrond\u2019s whitepaper, several challenges must be addressed properly in the process of creating an innovative public blockchain solution designed to scale:\n\n* Full decentralization \u2013 Elimination of the need for any trusted 3rd party, thus removing any single point of failure;\n* Robust security \u2013 Enabling secure transactions and removing risks of any attacks based on known attack vectors;\n* High scalability \u2013 Allowing the network to achieve performance at least equal to the centralized counterpart, measured in TPS;\n* Efficiency \u2013 Conducting all network services with minimum consumption of energy and computational resources;\n* Bootstrapping and storage enhancement \u2013 Guaranteeing a competitive cost for data storage and synchronization;\n* Cross-chain interoperability \u2013 Incorporated by design, allowing unlimited communication between external services.\n\n**Solution**\n\nIn order to start solving the said problems, Elrond was created as a complete rethinking of the public blockchain infrastructure, specifically designed with security, efficiency, scalability and interoperability in mind. Its main contribution is built upon two blocks:\n\n1. A genuine State Sharding approach \u2013 efficiently partitioning the blockchain and account state into multiple shards, handled in parallel by different participating validators;\n2. \u00a0Secure Proof of Stake consensus mechanism \u2013 an improved variation of Proof of Stake (PoS) that ensures long-term security and distributed fairness, along with eliminating the need for energy-intensive PoW algorithms.\n\n**Use Case Analysis**\n\nThe Elrond platform consists of multiple layers that add value to users in its ecosystem. Elrond Network\u2019s goal is to completely redesign public blockchain infrastructure adding advantages such as:\n\n1. High scalability \u2013 similar or better throughput than its centralized counterparts,\n2. Efficiency \u2013 carrying out all network services using minimum energy and computational power,\n3.

And, we already have these type of platforms offering unique solutions.\n\nMeet [VeChain\u00a0](https://www.vechain.org/)(VET), which offers an enterprise level public blockchain platform. They aim to integrate the real-world use cases with blockchain technology. To do so, they are going to provide governance structures, advanced IoT integration, and a robust economic model.\n\n## VeChain: Real-World Application Focus\n\nVeChain, unlike other blockchain platforms, aims to provide a solution for established system and help them take advantage of blockchain technology. Their true focus is on real-world use cases which makes them truly unique in their approach.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u8cx9qox2t921.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=191e554af7a0e7bfeb3bca67db737c76a09bc557\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to VeChain, their technology can be used in different verticals including luxury goods, cards, retail, cars, logistics, and even liquor sales. However, they are confident that they can change the way some major industries work and revolutionize them completely. Even their CEO Sunny Lu speaks about how their VeChain platform can be used to improve the supply chain, one of its main use cases.\n\nThis leads us to our next question, \u201c*How VeChain will revolutionize the supply chain?*\u201d Let\u2019s explore it below.\n\n### How VeChain will revolutionize the supply chain\n\nVeChain is mainly known for its supply-chain impact. After all, it is a product management platform and aims to solve one of the biggest problems in the industry, i.e., tracking and following goods in a supply chain scenario. So, how will it achieve those results? It will do it thanks to the blockchain technology by providing a secure and simple transaction between different entities related to supply chain including manufacturers, investors, consumers, and vendors. They will share all the important information to consumers, leading to an improved and more efficient version of supply chains across several distinct industries.\n\nBlockchain\u2019s usage will also bring transparency to the supply chain which will enable anyone to track materials and other key information such as customer feedback, service history and so on. In short, everything can be accessed or stored using blockchain ledgers, improving the overall supply chain management.\n\nTo make it work, manufacturers have to generate a unique key for each of the products/materials. This unique key will help suppliers, manufacturers and consumers interact directly with the platform to access key information about those goods, improving response time, customer feedback and so on.\n\nThe blockchain integration will also protect the interest of the brands and consumers against fake products. Fake products are a massive problem across the whole supply chain, and that can be further understood by the fact that China gave VeChain\u2019s platform to process one million bottles. China did this to counter the problem of fake wine bottles in their country. The same thing is also applicable across other goods and services. Want to know more about its supply-chain impact? Read about its partnerships [here.](https://cryptovest.com/reviews/what-is-vechain-thor-vet-a-blockchain-platform-aimed-to-digitize-the-supply-chain-and-tackle-goods-counterfeiting/)\n\n### VeChain token economics\n\nTo get a better understanding of VeChain, we also need to understand its token model. During its initial launch, VeChain used Ethereum smart contracts and was dependent on Ethereum technology. However, it soon created its own native blockchain and migrated to it. It is similar to how NEO uses its own blockchain rather than relying on Ethereum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f9j8y5uy2t921.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&s=5455d3e8f6ecddf6291f1e80c0171606a5ebdc17\n\n \n\nVeChain also follows NEO\u2019s footprint and offers two different utility tokens which include the VeChain Token(VET) and VeThor(THOR). Both of them have different use cases. Let\u2019s explore them below.\n\n#### VeChain Token(VET):\n\n**Use case:** VET acts as a smart payment currency and store of value.\n\n#### Thor Power(VeThor):\n\n**Use case:** Acts as a utility token for performing certain operations within the network. For example, transferring VET, executing smart contracts, and so on.\n\nThey also have a different way of acquisition. To acquire VET, you need to purchase it from an open market. If you are a strategic partner, you can also get it from a dedicated pool at a low rate. VeThor, on the other hand, is generated automatically if you hold VET in a supported wallet. VeThor is also available to buy from online markets. One can make the parallel between Thor and NEO\u2019s gas which are used in similar fashion to power the network and enable smart contract execution.\n\n## How you can earn passively using masternodes and Vechain\n\nVeChain uses Proof-of-Authority consensus model. It is a new consensus model which improves over the drawbacks of Proof-of-Stake(PoS), Proof-of-Work(PoW) and other consensus models. It reaches consensus without the need to have communication within nodes, and that\u2019s what makes the computation power requirements low. If you want an in-depth understanding of Proof-of-Authority, then we recommend reading its proper explanation [here](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/defining-the-vechainthor-blockchain-consensus-proof-of-authority-8cf3f51a5fa0).\n\nThe use of Proof-of-Authority enables you to earn passive income by hosting\u00a0masternodes. To get started you need the following:\n\n1. Minimum of 10,000 VET\n2. VeVID: Verified ID\n3. A VPS that can run 24/7 with a fixed IP address.\n\nThis means that you need to do an initial investment of a lump sum money including buying a minimum number of VET tokens. Also, you need to get a good VPS and a fixed IP address which also adds to the initial cost. An amazing [article written by NodesofValue](https://nodesofvalue.com/vechain-masternodes-analysis-of-passive-income-from-staking-with-nodes-x-nodes/) looks into how much it will cost to set up and run a VeChain\u00a0masternode. It is an in-depth guide and we recommend you to read it if you\u2019re seriously looking to get yourself a masternode. The article explains how you can earn rewards using different methods.\n\nBefore you start and set up your own masternode, you need to know that the returns vary depending on many factors including:\n\n1. VET price when you bought it.\n2. VeChain network traffic which depends on the actual usage of the network (partnerships play a major role)\n3. VThor price\n4. VeChain foundation decisions\n5. Size of the pools\n6. The number of nodes and x-nodes.\n\nAnd so on.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVeChain is undoubtedly a great project that aims to solve real-world problems. However, it is not as decentralized as one would like it to be. VeChain foundations control it. But, on the other hand, the project seems to hold solid fundamentals and the sheer number of partnerships that it has already established with major brands reinforces the idea that VeChain can definitely play an important role in bringing blockchain technology to real-world usage, specifically to improve the way supply chain works, bringing more efficiency and transparency to the whole industry. So, what do you think about VeChain? Do you think that it is the next big thing set to disrupt the supply chain industry?\n\n**Want to know more about it, join us on our Discord and Telegram channels and get into the discussion, or join our 8000 member community on our ICO DOG Investment Platform:**\n\n[**https://icodog.io/analysis/vechain-vet-the-supply-chain-revolution/**](https://icodog.io/analysis/vechain-vet-the-supply-chain-revolution/)",

Imagine the stunning possibilities of a system that combines the value and profitability of the illustrious gold mining industry with that of the blockchain technology, and what you get is an opportunity to invest in the future that can only offer higher yields in return. Welcome PMMSA.\n\nParaguay Mineral Mining SA (PMMSA) is a company that has been formed with some of the finest brains of the industry to excavate gold from the rich areas of Paso Yobai. Located at a distance of 150 kilometers from the capital city of Asuncion, Paso Yobai is one of the most promising gold sites of eastern Paraguay. The locals residing in the area have now decided to sell the gold-rich areas to prospective buyers since the 30% excavations of gold executed by them is all they could manage given the limitations in machinery and equipment.\n\nPMMSA plans to excavate 83.37 hectares of gold-rich areas of Paso Yobai from the APM (Association de Mineros Pequenos), the group formed by the locals when the excavations were initially started. PMMSA understands the potential of the gold deposits and has hence completed the required geological surveys along with drilling equipment to sample the deposits from its test planet which is already operational in the target zone.\n\nPMMSA believes in the potential of the power of decentralized technologies and has hence decided to raise the funds required for land purchase, excavation, building the necessary infrastructure and building a main plant at the site through the blockchain technology by offering the ORET token through ICO (Initial Coin Offering). The ORET token is an Ethereum based ERC20 token standard and has the following accredits:\n\n\u25cf Each ORET token is priced at $0.50 USD\n\n\u25cf $150,000 USD worth of ORET is the maximum permissible purchase value for an individual.\n\n\u25cf The tokens hard cap is set at 12,500,000\n\n\u25cf To be sold through an Ethereum based Smart Contract\n\n\u25cf The purchase is through Ethereum\n\n\u25cf ORET tokens to be offered through both Airdrop as well as ICO with the latter forming 96% of the total sales.\n\n\u25cf Comes with the blockchain benefits of transparency, reliability, safety and security\n\n\u25cf ORET tokens cannot be purchased by residents of USA and China\n\nProject Stages\n\nPMMSA plans to complete the excavation in three well-planned stages formulated through detailed satellite imaging technology, ground analysis reports, and sampling on its test plant.\n\nExperts agree gold is the strongest investment today. What happens when it meets the power of\n\nBlockchain\n\nPhase-1 aims to cover 43 hectares with an expected output of 319,102 ounces of gold.\n\nPhase-2 aims to cover 24 hectares with an expected output of 212,734 ounces of gold.\n\nPhase-3 aims to cover 10 hectares with an expected output of 106,367 ounces of gold.\n\nThe estimated cost per stage stands at $6,000,000 USD, $4,000,000 USD, and $2,500,000 USD respectively.\n\nPMMSA has taken care of its investors through its innovati ve profit sharing program the details of which are listed below:\n\n\u25cf The company aims to sell the excavated gold each week in USD.\n\n\u25cf Of the weekly net profits, 45% is converted to Ethereum and given to token holders weekly.\n\n\u25cf Starting from the second year, 40% of the weekly profits are given to token holders every week. The reduction in 5% is for raising further capital and development and is assured to more than compensate with higher yields once the main plant becomes operational.\n\n\u25cf For the token holders to receive the weekly profit, the ORET tokens need to be stored on an ERC20 compatible wallet and should not be listed on any exchange at the time of the weekly snapshot.\n\n\u25cf Returns are assured to be substantial post the first 6-7 months of operation once the main plant is fully functional.\n\nPMMSA has redefined the gold mining industry through ORET tokens based on the revolutionary blockchain technology. The combination of a high yield time tested industry with that of a futuristic technology is indeed the beginning of a new era in the gold mining industry. PMMSA is set to alter the gold mining sector forever and is well on its way to be a leader at that.",

            "text": "Dear Reddit community\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nWe are excited to be granted the opportunity to present our project Dusk Network here. Dusk Network revolves around privacy, transparency and providing a balance between the two. In this post we attempt to tell you more about why we provide a balance, the use-cases and how we aim to achieve this through our new blockchain infrastructure solution.\n\nTo outline why a balance between privacy and transparency is needed requires us to dive a little deeper into the blockchain solutions that are already available out there and what we believe is a real requirement for future blockchain adoption.\n\n**Short summary:**\n\nOther blockchain platforms treat privacy as an all-or-nothing. They either provide (arguably) complete anonymity (for example Monero) or complete transparency (for example Ethereum).\n\nThe main use cases we see now when it comes to privacy platforms is that they focus on just one thing: transfer of value.\n\nThe Dusk network aims to go much further than that. Dusk does not just focus on transfer of value or payments but also on actual communication through video & audio, file transfers, messaging and even streaming)\n\nOur second point of attention will be around Securitized Tokens (STO, X-ST20)\n\nThe Dusk Network\u2019s blockchain infrastructure is perfectly suitable for asset ownership transfers (for example Security Token Offerings).\n\nBy solving a focussed set of use-cases and allowing for the proper confidentiality for each case, the Dusk Network is the first crypto-system that aims at providing privacy while being regulatory compliant.\n\n**Diving Deeper**\n\nlet us dive deeper into the requirements of asset ownership transfers (the other use cases are clearly outlined on our website FAQ: [www.dusk.network/faq](https://www.dusk.network/faq)).\n\nTransfer of asset ownership is subject to different forms of regulations. In some cases, full transparency is compulsory (for example in the case of cadastral registration of real estate ownership transfers), in others confidentiality is enforced by legislators (like in the case of stock purchases). To help third parties to meet the legal requirements of their ownership transfer use-case, the Dusk protocol provides an optional on-chain operation of whitelisting. In the sensitive case of securities, we are also developing a Confidential Security Token Standard that allows third parties to issue security tokens on top of the Dusk Network (the XST standard). Security tokens implementing the XST will have both privacy (i.e. investment and market positions are not openly broadcasted on the ledger) and Regulatory Compliance data (transfer of these tokens can happen only if purchasers add to the transaction KYC data satisfying regulatory requirements) embedded directly in the transaction protocol. This is extremely important to prevent manipulation.\n\nEven though, we now need to keep it short and to the point, we would love to elaborate on our approaches and technologies behind Dusk Network.\n\n**TLDR**: The Dusk network aims to be an entire ecosystem developed by both a core and public open source team. The platform is being built to launch securitized tokens and allow private voice calls, video and file transfers.\n\nInterested to read more?\n\nRead our whitepaper for technical documentation as well as formally written algorithms: [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dusk-network/whitepaper/releases/download/v0.3/dusk-whitepaper.pdf](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dusk-network/whitepaper/releases/download/v0.3/dusk-whitepaper.pdf)\n\nOne Pager Summary: [https://dusk.network/dusk-summary.pdf](https://dusk.network/dusk-summary.pdf)\n\nWe also started an introductory series to Dusk Network on our Medium page:\n\nPart 1: [https://medium.com/@DuskNetwork/dusk-in-a-nutshell-50b6e8a17c00](https://medium.com/@DuskNetwork/dusk-in-a-nutshell-50b6e8a17c00)\n\nPart 2: [https://medium.com/@DuskNetwork/the-anonymous-network-layer-explained-ccb93fd222ca](https://medium.com/@DuskNetwork/the-anonymous-network-layer-explained-ccb93fd222ca)\n\nFeel free to follow our medium for all the future parts of the series.\n\nDusk Network is raising funds through Private Sale at the moment.\n\nJoin us on our Social Media:\n\nWebsite: [https://dusk.network/](https://dusk.network/)\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/DuskNetwork](https://t.me/DuskNetwork)\n\nReddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dusknetwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/dusknetwork)\n\nMedium: [https://medium.com/@DuskNetwork](https://medium.com/@DuskNetwork)\n\nNote: Mods dm'ed for donation",

Ubcoin is an eBay-like Ethereum-powered marketplace that allows people to exchange real goods for cryptocurrency and vice versa. Ubcoin will be part of the Ubank mobile app that is pre-installed by Samsung in 10 countries and has over 16 mln installations worldwide. In July 2018 Ubank announced that it started partnership with LG Electronics about having Ubank available for LG users.*\n\n**The first working version of the Ubcoin Marketplace was introduced by the Ubank CEO on July, 14th in Seoul during a meetup organised by Ubcoin for its Korean contributors and potential stakeholders.**\n\n**At the moment the 1.0 version of the marketplace has features that were described in the company\u2019s roadmap:** creating a listing to start selling, an advanced search system, a chat establishing a real time communication between a seller and a buyer, and the process of buying an item for UBC tokens (utility tokens for settlement of smart contacts and fees on the platform). The public beta of the platform will be available for testing at the end of August, 2018.\n\n**During the event in Seoul the Ubcoin team also showed the latest updates in its own artificial intelligence system based on deep neural networks, which is designed to improve user experience, automate the processes and minimise legal and ethical risks for the business.** Ubcoin Market uses machine learning techniques to moderate content, create personal recommendations, predict the price of goods, improve the quality of product images and identify suspicious ads.\n\n**You can look at some features from the marketplace and test the AI-bot here:** [**https://ubcoin.io/en/#universe**](https://ubcoin.io/en/#universe)\n\nUbcoin Market utilizes decentralized technologies to create an easy-to-use tool that solves problems of people wishing to enter the world of crypto investments in a hassle-free manner. Ubcoin additionally is useful for experienced blockchain market participants in need of a convenient method of spending their crypto wealth. Ubcoin Market will become an integral part of the Ubank app by the end of 2018.\n\n**Korea was chosen by the Ubcoin team to be presented with the first version of the product for a strategic reason.** Ubank has pre-installation agreements with South Korean tech giants Samsung and started partnership with LG Electronics about having Ubank available for LG users. Ubank is planning to start the Ubcoin Market expansion into the booming Asian market at the beginning of 2019. Earlier this year, Ubank received investment from the Singapore-based VC fund [Amereus Group](http://www.amereus.com/) for the promotion of Ubcoin Market in Asia. By the end of 2018, the project is planning to open offices in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Seoul to implement the market launch strategy of the peer-to-peer ecosystem in the region.\n\nCurrently, Ubcoin Market is conducting its [public token sale](https://ubcoin.io/en) until August 27th. **You can buy Ubcoin tokens at a discount now on** [**https://ubcoin.io/en**](https://ubcoin.io/en)",

            "text": "Rubius is a blockchain software startup dedicated to developing high-quality cryptocurrency products like Aryl, which is an easy-to-use Ethereum wallet and payment platform.\n\nAryl allows users to send, receive, or request payments in the currency of their choice. It provides access to decentralized Ethereum wallets, which support thousands of cryptocurrencies. Aryl can be used with ANY tradable Ethereum tokens and it gives users access to our centralized crypto-exchange called Rubiex, where they can buy, sell, and trade select cryptocurrencies.\n\nAryl is essentially the Venmo of cryptocurrencies, as it also includes a social media aspect, allowing users to connect with friends directly in the app. But it also provides privacyprotection for those who prefer anonymity.\n\nTo fund the development of the Aryl app and Rubiex exchange, we are having an ICO (initial coin offering). We\u2019re offering our very-own cryptocurrency called Rubius (ticker symbol: RUBY). RUBY or RUBYs (pronounced: Rubies) are a decentralized cryptocurrency operating on the Ethereum platform\u2019s smart contract (scripting) protocol.\n\nAfter deploying Aryl and Rubiex, we plan to develop a wide-range of trustless financial products and will be offering many unique financial services. In the future, we also plan on developing our own blockchain infrastructure and using it to disrupt a number of non-financial sectors.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**ARYL**\n\nAryl is an open-source Ethereum wallet and payment platform. Aryl will be very similar to PayPal\u2019s Venmo app, although it will have the added benefit of cryptocurrency storage and trading. Aryl will make cryptocurrency simpler to acquire and use, and it will protect people\u2019s money from the risks of the unstable crypto-markets by using its SWITCH feature.\n\nAryl\u2019s main purpose is to make cryptocurrency and blockchain technology more accessible, consumer-friendly, and risk-free. As with any new technology, it will take cryptocurrency and blockchain some time to catch on with the general public. To encourage adoption, the Aryl app will feature an intuitive layout so people can immediately start to use it with no prior training required.\n\nInside Aryl, users can access their decentralized Ethereum wallets, which support thousands of cryptocurrencies. Users will also have the ability to access our centralized crypto-exchange, Rubiex. By signing up for Rubiex, users can buy, sell, and trade select cryptocurrencies directly from the Aryl app. The Rubiex exchange will also be utilized for the currency SWITCH feature.\n\n**ARYL APP FEATURES**\n\n1. ***Send, Receive, and Request:*** In the Aryl app, users have the ability to send, receive, or request payments in either fiat currency, Ether, or Ethereum tokens, making it useful for transactions in traditional currency and cryptocurrency.\n2. ***Connect with Friends:*** The home screen features all of the recent activity (i.e. the requests, payments, events, etc.) from a user\u2019s friends. These friends will be voluntarily gathered from either a person\u2019s contacts or from connecting a social media account (i.e. Facebook). In a later version of Aryl, we plan to provide users with a secure messenger, allowing them to chat with their friends directly in the app.\n3. ***In-iMessage Usage:*** Users will be able to send and request payments directly from their iMessage conversations. This will allow for real-time payments whenever you owe a friend money or if your friend owes you money. If a user sends or requests a payment from a contact that doesn\u2019t have an Aryl account, the contact will be prompted to sign-up for Aryl to complete the transaction. With Aryl, you never need to worry about sending payments to the wrong wallet address. That\u2019s because the Aryl app has you select the recipient using the contact\u2019s name, rather than their wallet address.\n4. ***Wallet Functionality:*** Aryl provides users with many decentralized wallet features, such as creating new Ethereum wallets (the key pairs to these wallets are stored locally on your iOS device), viewing balances of Ether and Ethereum tokens, and changing wallet passwords.\n5. ***Exchange Features:*** Aryl will allow users to trade their cryptocurrency directly in the app. To use the exchange features, we will require users to sign-up for Rubiex by providing additional KYC (know your customer) information to prevent money laundering and fraud. A web-based version of our exchange will be located at: [www](http://www/). [rubiex.com](https://rubiex.com/).\n6. ***Currency Switch:*** Aryl\u2019s Switch feature reduces the risk of using cryptocurrencies by keeping users\u2019 money. in a safer currency and then automatically SWITCHING it into their preferred cryptocurrency when they are sending a payment. When you receive a payment, the currency you receive will be automatically converted back into your preferred storage currency. This feature will allow you to utilize cryptocurrency without having to worry about losing money due to market volatility (i.e., the price of cryptocurrencies dropping).\n\n**Learn More**\n\nVisit our Website: [https://rubius.io/](https://rubius.io/)\n\nRead our whitepaper: [https://rubius.io/rubius-whitepaper.pdf](https://rubius.io/rubius-whitepaper.pdf)\n\nWatch a short explanatory video: [http://youtu.be/4DLMajAfxsM](http://youtu.be/4DLMajAfxsM)\n\nCheck out our Sub-Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RubiusICO/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RubiusICO/)",

            "text": "**ABOUT TERAWATT:**\n\nTerawatt is a patent-pending, renewable energy blockchain startup, with a strong focus on monetization and driving global L.E.D. adoption. Terawatt will create a DAO, and also a deflationary Ethereum-based, private (zk-SNARKS) currency8 for global payments. The DAO will be funded and used by Utility Companies, L.E.D. Sellers, Businesses, token holders, and energy customers worldwide. The DAO will act as a decentralized global mutual/insurance fund to ensure Utilities (and businesses) always have access to funding (which constantly runs out) for subsidizing L.E.D. sales to their energy customers (or for businesses upgrading to L.E.D.s).\n\nUtility companies and other businesses will want to use our tokens for payments because the rate of deflation is much greater than all FIAT currencies and most, if not all, cryptocurrencies/tokens while also being more private and secure with zk-SNARKS and masternodes when available. Also, the more tokens they have to enter into the DAO fund, the more voting power, profits, and staking rewards they can receive. This will further increase token value due to the network effect. (Metcalfe's Law) Total Supply: 100 Million Tokens\n\nCirculating Supply: 65 million (supply will decrease exponentially in an s-curve fashion to as low as 1 million tokens over time). This is due to our continuous coin burning algorithm. Terawatt will automatically use 50-75&#37; of company profits earned from DAO entry/exit fees, profit taking fees (like an exchange), time decay fees, carbon tax data storage fees, carbon credits, and even from affiliate L.E.D. sales commissions to buyback and burn (LED) Tokens. This is similar to the BNB token, but they only burn every quarter, we will burn 24/7.\n\n**PRIVATE SALE INFO:**\n\nToken Price =$0.20/.0004 ETH per LED \n\n**All token purchases receive 100\\% BONUS** \n\n0.1 ETH Minimum Purchase Size \n\n3, 950 ETH Hard Cap\n\n**RESTRICTIONS: Belize, Singapore, China, Canada, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Iraq, United States, and any other countries the US is in direct conflict with or where token sales are prohibited**\n\nACCESS SALE NOW: https://terawattico.io/presale/?ref=OOMPA601\n\n**Donation: PM'ed mods**",

            "text": "* \n\n**Opinion:** This is a project like so many others that say they created a coin for every day use by people and merchants yet there isn't one project out there ready to be accepted by merchants, specially this one. They say they will use the NASGO blockchain which is an unproven blockchain and they would have no control on how it is run. They say to have a \"stable\" coin yet there is absolutely no mention as to how it will be stable. Plus, any coin on an exchange CANNOT EVER BE STABLE. Their security is by a company that supplies security on servers and have nothing to do with blockchain. They say that their blockchain will charge no fees yet they promise their merchants a 20&#37; to 60&#37; return every day. To do this, they have to give them worthless coins that are backed by nothing. For merchants to get cash back, they need to purchase a $5000 masternode. They have a far fetched project called AIR for the end of the year that involves, you guessed it, AR and AI. They also want to pre-mine 100 BILLION coins that would take forever to grow in value IF this project ever got off the ground. They think that they are a utility coin and will never have to worry about regulations. I did not find ANYTHING in their white paper (one of the saddest white papers I have ever read) that would convince me that this coin could ever be used for anything let alone accepted by merchants. I could go on but I think this is enough to get the idea to stay away from this project.\n\n**- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -**\n\n*Name of project:* ***DUTYOF.CARE***\n\n* \n* People already doing something similar: Very few\n* Difficulty of this project: High because of the need to reach all the institutions\n* Are they complicating something that should be simpler: Not very much\n* Time to complete project: Can be operational soon, functional in a year and complete in about two years depending on funding.\n\n**Opinion:** I think that this project has merit and should be done. They will be verifying the validity of the care-givers licenses to care for people in need. As is, it may be harder to sell to institutions because they don't get enough in return but this can easily be better. I think that they should also create a part where people, co-workers and institutions can rate the care-givers and have those ratings available to all as well as have the institutions rated by all. I would recommend to them to create and use their own private blockchain for many reasons and also create a fixed price coin for payments. Their hearts are in the right place plus they have a good road map. As an investment, this project would be a long term one because if done right, it should slowly keep getting better.\n\n**- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -**\n\n*Name of project:* ***DASHING***\n\n* \n* Does it feel legit or a scam: Legit\n* What risk is there in investing: Medium-low\n* Is this idea realistic: Yes\n* How clear is the project: Very\n* People already doing something similar: A few\n* Difficulty of this project: High in that it will take quite a bit of marketing getting known\n* Are they complicating something that should be simpler: No\n* Time to complete project: About a year\n\n**Opinion:** I like this project, it has very good potential. They have thought of just about everything but there are a few things that could be made better, more open and secure. there are ways to simplify a few little things but I am certain that they will work them out. They seem dedicated to making this work and as an investment, I think it would be a good long term one.

I decided to kill a few birds with one review. I decided to lump these travel ICOs together because they are all basically saying the same thing. Even though some may be legit, they will never get off the ground. They don't have a clue what is involved in getting the travel industry to switch over. They don't have a stable token so that eliminates ANY travel agency signing up and accepting cryptos. No customers are going to want to pay with cryptos (YET) because there are no ways for people to get their money back if problems occur and even if they say they have arbitrators, that requires a middleman and the reason for crypto IS TO GET RID OF THE MIDDLEMAN. They all talk about being decentralized and we all know how easy-to-use (sarcasm) decentralized Dapps are to use (front-ends). They mention that travel would be cheaper and easier by using the blockchain. That is false. Today, it would actually cost more because of all the transfer fees in and out of fiat plus it would be more difficult than it is today to purchase travel having to buy the right cryptocurrency, wait for it to be really confirmed in your wallet, send them to the travel agent and wait again for the confirmation and then the travel agent needs to change it back to fiat to pay his suppliers.\n\nYou will notice that most of them mention the $7 trillion travel market when in fact it is $2.3 trillion directly attributed to the travel industry. The rest is indirect sales because of the travel industry.\n\nThis year is not the time to start trying to get cryptocurrencies into the travel industry, it just isn't ready yet.\n\nMy recommendation to all of these people and their projects is to keep using the existing systems and maybe only put a copy of the transactions on the blockchain if they want to offer \"transparency\" of some sort. I have only seen one project that would have worked but it was put on the back-burner for now.\n\nI would stay away from any travel booking ICO or project unless of course they are offering something great that blockchain can really solve but that hasn't happened yet..\n\nThe projects I include in this assessment, to stay away from, are:\n\n**Ongoing ICOs:**\n\n* ***Smart trip Platform***\n* ***TravelBlock***\n* ***Travelertoken***\n* ***Ethereum travel Token (also ETH Travel)***\n* ***Ticko***\n* ***WeGold***\n* ***TripBit***\n* ***GoneTrippin***\n* ***Tuk Tuk Pass (even more work and harder to do)***\n* ***World Tourism (also TourCoin)***\n* ***SkyPay***\n* ***Travvil***\n\n**Ended:**\n\n* ***Concierge (travala)***\n* ***Cool Cousin***\n* ***Coin Tour***\n* ***TravelCoin***\n* ***TravelKoin***\n* ***Cubaaz***\n* ***Lotus***\n* ***Machtcoin***\n\nIt is unbelievable how many crappy projects, in general, and scams are out there. They aren't diamonds in the rough, they are turds in a stack of turds with very few diamonds to be found.\n\nI am always excited when I find a great idea and happy to see that there are still some brilliant people out there that want to make a better difference with their projects.\n\nI/we need to create a place that is very visible and that will catch on to denounce all the scammers. A place that the authorities could use as a base to start investigating these people BEFORE any damage is done.\n\n**- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -**\n\n*Name of project:* ***YONDO***\n\n* \n* *The need for this idea:* small\n* *Does this solve anything:* Not really\n* *Practicality of this idea:* Not very practical\n* *Need to be on a blockchain:* No\n* *Is a token necessary:* No\n* *Does it feel legit or a scam:* Legit\n* *What risk is there in investing:* Very high\n* *Is this idea realistic:* Yes\n* *How clear is the project:* Clear\n* *People already doing something similar:* Yes but on servers where this idea belongs\n* *Difficulty of this project:* Low difficulty in doing it, very high difficulty having it make money\n* *Are they complicating something that should be simpler:* Yes\n* *Time to complete project:* Ongoing\n\n**Opinion:** Someone asked me about this project so I checked it out and read their white paper. I am not impressed with this project. They already have a working system on servers and it just looks like they want to get into the \"crypto\" game. There are already, at least, 10 other websites offering similar stuff (off blockchain). They have no financial reason to add reward tokens to their system nor do they need to have their own token. Nobody will buy their token because it will be a hassle to get and nobody will want to use it because it will be volatile just like all the others. The only part of their system that would be on a blockchain would be the rewards program and the payment system. Unless their original system was corrupt and nobody trusted it, there isn't much reason to change to a blockchain. As for their white paper, when they start their white paper talking about the token launch, that is a red flag for me. They aren't solving anything with this project nor are they making it easier and better. Their rewards program is a losing proposition. They can't expect to make any money by giving away everything. they say they will be able to exchange reward points for gift cards at major retailers but the only way that will happen is if Yondo take the reward coins and purchase the gift cards with cash that will come from where since nobody is buying any reward coins; they are given away to everyone. The only way I see them possibly braking even is if they have a ton of advertising on their website. We all know how much we love to see advertisements all over. this project is a losing proposition; the more people that actually use it, the more money they will lose.\n\n**- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -**\n",

All the near-perfect ratings from before are still there.\n\nThe fact that none of the seven advisors bothered to check the whitepaper in the first instance is bad enough.

            "text": "Blockchain technology is a very important innovation engine in todays industry. It is driven by security and freedom. It is a decentralized form or records that eliminates borders and connects people around of world. The system of economics on which crpytocurrency is based, i.e. blockchain, has attracted many technology evangelists. Furthermore, Ethereum, the most popular blockchain for DApp (see Figure 3), is a special case that has motivated our team to bring new and advanced solutions. The heart of Ethereum technology is smart contract).\n\n\u201dSmart contracting \u2019technology could reduce banks infrastructure costs attributable to cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance by between $15 20 billion per annum by 2022\u2019\u201d Santander, The Fintech 2.0 Paper: Rebooting Financial Services, 2015\nTo develop smart contracts on Ethereum, blockchain needs to use Solidity[11], a contract-oriented programming language. It is quite clear, that exposure to this language is not ubiquitous. The developer must study both the syntax and architecture of smart contract and this is no simple task. Of course, there are other solutions that employ smart contract technology. We will not review each of these in detail, but only mention that some of them introduce additional features and support, however, our development, IoLite is a totally different concept.\nOne of interesting mechanisms that the Ethereum smart contract created is the ICO crowd-funding methodology. A major part of smart contracts is written for ICO needs only. This is done by a small number of professionals and, most important, time is required to write applications, or migrate applications to blockchain technology, since this task requires capabilities of:\nWriting smart contracts (short term effort).\n\nUnderstanding application logic (long term application development).\nAs a result smart contract developers are overloaded since specialist must focus on short term efforts of writing smart contracts; which, by the way, is usually the most profitable part of a project (the most popular is ICO).\n\nOf course, there other are smart contract-driven systems, that support other languages, like JS, C#. Many groups have attempted to bring a larger number of languages to support Virtual Machines for smart contracts. However, all these solutions are not complete and, of course, do not utilize the power of the community. This energy should move from enthusiasm over ICO to creating real products and engines! Our goal is to make DApp development easier, reduce ICO costs and focus on application ecosystems, in cases where the application is required and has a real market. We believe that almost any application today that is available on mobile application markets and requires a server, has is reasonable place on a blockchain. Our goal is to develop the IoLite blockchain to create an inexpensive and effective ecosystem for DApps that will be easily integrated with FAE modules, where the same programmers/engineers who develop mainstream applications can write integration modules for blockchain.\n\nLets make blockchain easy and desirable for the application market!\nWe want to take the ICO idea of crowd-funding to create crowd-based efforts for developing/extending languages. We wish to motivate people to write new dictionary structures to better understand formal languages and thus machines.\nPart of the IoLite vision is to make blockchain data valuable and reuse it, not only for block confirmation, but also as valuable knowledge. The FAE engine not only provides easy access from different languages to write smart contract, but actually creates a pool of vocabularies/solutions for naturalized interfaces. Imagine a mobile developer attempting to create an application to manage a robot-controlled parking lot. She can go to the IoLite blockchain and check if such a robot naturalized interface exists (FAE), and if so, she can take the SDK and implement it. It is like a Google translator API. IoLite contributors will obviously want to extend such interfaces, based on market demand. Of course, academic centers will take advantage of such system as well.\nIoLite is about bridging the gaps between humanbeings and machines\n\nhttps://iolite.io/",

            "text": "iOlite is an open\\-source, blockchain and machine learning platform, that will allow anyone to write smart contracts, using any language, natural or programming. The platform is developed with the purpose of bringing more mainstream users, commercial and non\\-commercial, to start using blockchain technology. iOlite tokens will be used to compensate contributors in the iOlite network that help with the machine\\-learning process: each text parsing suggestion that is accepted by the iOlite Fast Adaptation Engine \\(FAE\\), will be compensated with iLT tokens. In addition, authors will be able to share their smart contracts with other iOlite ecosystem members, for fees in iLT tokens.\n\n**About iOlite**\n\niOlite\u200a\u2014\u200aCreate Smart Contracts With Natural LanguageiOlite is a product which focuses on the mass adoption of smart contract technology by providing an easy to use engine which is capable of understanding natural language to be compiled to smart contract code. iOlite is the ideal solution if you don\u2019t want to spend time learning, instead just start creating smart contracts.\n\niOlite is based on the research done at Stanford University. They invented the FAE \\(Fast Adaptation Engine\\), which is capable of converting natural language or any other desired programming language into smart contract code. The FAE is not just straightaway translating your input to code. The FAE depends on contributors \\(smart contract experts\\) that are able to define structures containing language expressions. Furthermore, these structures are tied to smart contract code they write. This allows the engine to browse the structures to find the right expression so it can compile the desired smart contract. Whenever a structure is used, a contributor gets iOlite tokens rewarded.\n\niOlite relies on the community to make the FAE successful. The FAE helps them by applying Machine Training techniques to help it learn and adopt new structures more easily.\n\niOlite Labs is currently focusing on Ethereum smart contracts with Solidity as there is a massive need.\n\nWhat this means is that not only can programmers \\(in formal languages such as Python, C, JavaScript, etc.\\) immediately use their existing skills to write smart contracts, but also average people with no programming knowledge whatsoever, can just as easily start developing with natural languages like English. iOlite is dissolving the existing technical learning boundaries for creating smart contracts.",

Faxport will also lower economic cost and optimize the allocation of resources in sports via the application of its artificial intelligence agreements that enable its participants to verify the credentials and identity of another party with ease when carrying out transactions and communications on the Faxport platform.\nIt should be noted that Faxport is in active joint operation with China\u2019s largest sports commerce database and is also taking the lead in the Japanese sports workforce. The Faxport project is based on the Ethereum smart contract which will help redefine methods of transaction. Faxport also has its token (FAS) which can be used to buy FX (credits that are used on the Faxport platform) with discounts. The FAS token is the standard investment equivalents on FAX GO crowdfunding platform.Sports commerce is still developing globally. The sports industry is one that is widely popular and has grown at a rate of 5% yearly in the last 10 years. In the UK, 2.4% of the workforce are engaged in sports. The US has a similar value with 2.5%. According to data, the sports industry globally, has a production value of about $200 million USD, yearly (includes competitive sporting events, sports & fitness industry, sporting goods, venue operators, intermediaries, and traditional sports media).Faxport token (FAS) is based on the ERC20 Ethereum standard. A total of 200 million FAS have been issued. The FAS can be used to buy FX credit on Faxport, as well as fiat currency. Note that, FX has a value of US$0.1 per 1 FX). Also, a 15% discount exists for FX purchase with FAS.\nThere will be a dividend of 15% for holders of the FAS token every quarter. This will, however, be based on the service charge of transactions on the Faxport platform.

However, beyond that, the Contract Vault\nAPI and Platform-as-a-Service functionality enable the creation of complete\nBlockchain applications.\n\nTo further illustrate the benefits of our SmartTemplates and PaaS features and\nthe vast range of potential usages we are listing some featured use cases and\napplications currently in development or being planned that use or leverage\nthe Contract Vault platform.\n\n**SmartShares**\n\n\nSmartShares aims to solve the following problems with\nthe help of Contract Vault\u2019s Ricardian Contracts and\nidentity services:\n\n* Create markets for unlisted companies and manage\nthe exchange of shares.\n\n*  Create liquidity for what is currently mostly\nan illiquid asset.\n\n*  Allow companies to manage their relationships\nwith shareholders via Smart Contracts.\n\n*  Pay dividends seamlessly with Smart Contracts.\n\n\nStock markets are complicated and expensive, so nonlisted\nentities have no way of accessing the liquid funds\noffered by an open market without the considerable\nexpense of an IPO or at least the significant pain of listing\non a subsidiary market like AIM. Costs are also high for\nthose executing trades. By using Smart Contracts to\ntokenise non-listed company shares and Ricardian\nContracts to make them tradeable, the cost of dealing\ncan come down to a fraction of what even today\u2019s online\nshare platforms can offer.\nFurthermore, with non-listed company shares digitised on\nthe Blockchain, other aspects such as voting and dividend\nallocation, for example, can be done more efficiently.\nAlso, shareholders can use their - now liquid - shares\nas securities to raise capital.\nAs a first step, interested companies need to evaluate\nand amend their statutes and shareholders agreements,\nenable the tokenisation of shares, and set rules for their\ntransfer, if any. We are cooperating with notaries to ensure\nan efficient and cost-effective amendment. Once tokenised,\nthe SmartShares replace the existing ones, and each company\nruns its own token Smart Contract which holds a list of\nshareholders and their token allocation. Making a trade\nis as simple as moving entitlements as with any Blockchain\ntransaction: the ledger is decentralised, and the\ntransaction is corroborated by agreement.\nWe are working on the processes (and they are processes,\nnot digital tools) to ensure the identities of the parties in\na trade can be established and connected to Ethereum\naddresses. Each exchange must also be digitally signed \u2013\nsynchronously \u2013 for a trade to take place, and those digital\nsignatures also verified. Contract Vault is a leader in\nRicardian Contracts; the Smart Contracts with the legal\nand functional qualities required to execute trades actively.\nSmartShares is a joint venture with our technical and legal\npartners, we have already put significant work into the\nlegal frameworks to make decentralised trading a reality.\nOur SmartShares product (a trading environment and\nsupport services for the development of trading oriented\nSmart Contracts) is already in development, building on\nthe architecture provided by the Contract Vault Platform.\n\nmore information at https://www.contractvault.io/\n\nwant to take part in the Bounty campaign, go here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3463255.0",

This relentlessly innovative sector keeps spilling forth exciting projects that have the potential to radically change and improve the world we live in.\n\nThe crowdfunding practice has successfully taken root in developed countries. However, the problem of financing still exists in developing and emerging economies where small businesses struggle to get capital. The crowdfunding market remains an exclusive membership club of sorts: the largest platforms select a limited number of projects which meet their requirements, charging fees and denying access to less economically developed countries.\n\nAcorn Collective aims to solve these problems by presenting the first blockchain crowdfunding platform. It is designed to eliminate high entry barriers and provide even small businesses with democratic, free, and open access to the crowdfunding market regardless of their location. With Acorn, any lawful and ethical project will be able to get funding.\n\n\nThe Acorn ecosystem will consist of a crowdfunding hub and a secondary marketplace for selling post-campaign goods and services using OAK - a new ERC-20, fixed-supply token on the Ethereum blockchain. OAK is designed to serve as the main exchange mechanism within the Acorn ecosystem, facilitating all transactions in the Acorn hub and connecting backers, founders, and consumers. With the OAK token, users will be able to fund projects, purchase goods and services, get access to Acorn support services, and conduct point-of-sale transactions via the Acorn Local mobile payment app.\n\nCurrent platforms are equity-backed, and they always prioritize projects promising the best returns. With Acorn\u2019s approach to crowdfunding, project backers will be token holders, not equity holders, so the value of any project will be equally defined by the growth of the entire Acorn ecosystem and OAK.\n\nAcorn Collective ICO details\nThe team behind the project has successfully closed the pre-sale round, with all 7 million OAK sold out. Now it is getting ready for the ICO, which starts on April 28 and is scheduled to close on May 28. The total supply of OAK tokens is limited to 90 million, with 72 million (80%) of them available for sale and distribution in the ICO.\n\nThe exchange rate is set at 1 ETH: 800 OAKS. The project developers hope to reach a hard cap of 65 million OAK. Please note that OAK cannot be mined, and no new tokens will be created after the sale closes.\n\n\n\nRead more: https://cryptovest.com/news/acorn-collective-sets-forth-to-democratize-crowdfunding/ ",

Some of these problems are unreliable sellers and products, a lengthy authorization process and high transaction costs, and the inability to keep up with the rapid growth of Blockchain technology.**\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n> Over the past few decades, the world of retail trade has changed dramatically. In 2018, the total volume of e-commerce sales will reach one-tenth of the total retail market sales around the world, and by 2020 it will cost more than $ 4 trillion. Sales around the world grow double-digit annually and will continue to do so in the near future.\n\n---\n\n> The developers of Peur strive to make their project the most convenient way to make transactions around the world. At the moment, the initiators are actively conducting ICO. Within the framework of Crowd Sale, it is planned to collect sufficient capital for the full development of the platform.\n\n\n---\n\n**About the project!**\n\n\n**Peur** is an application that is enough to cover the entire market. Their task is to develop and implement an advanced transaction system to help small businesses and B2B, B2C enterprises and service providers grow together.\n\n* Creating a global decentralized wage system and a market system.\n* They made the payment process simple and efficient with a single click.\n* Helping traders get money faster, with fewer fees for guaranteed payroll, built into a smart contract.\n* By allowing the merchant to accept the mobile payment.\n* They bring the savings of the token based on Ethereum to everyday life.\n\n\n---\n\n**About the platform?**\n\n**Peur** is a new market, using the technology of decentralization. With it, you can integrate payment transactions. To enjoy all the advantages of the system, as the creators claim, it is comfortable not only for beginners but also for advanced specialists. It provides for the possibility of investing in various types of digital assets for their subsequent management. Inside the platform, there is a store that allows you to make purchases, or sell your own goods. You can make payment using your own cryptocurrency.\n\n\n> **Flexible pricing policy:**\n\n* The Peur delivery model allows the user to pay for a personalized individual subscription for each month, which ensures that they will never pay more than they need.\n\n> **A universal gift:**\n\n* Their professional team and reliable solutions for calculating wages serve you anywhere in the world.\n\n> **Low overhead:**\n\n* Using a secure platform instead of their own system, they can reduce overall investment in software, hardware, and other valuable resources.\n\n> **Strict security protocols:**\n\n* They are vigilant in monitoring and maintaining their security standards, ensuring the protection of the user\u2019s confidential information.\n\n> **Provides business continuity:**\n\n* They provide an unhindered transfer of knowledge without documented systems and data recovery plans, even if your company changes its infrastructure.\n\n\n---\n\n**Why Blockchain?**\n\nTo increase the level of privacy and security, Blockchain mechanisms are used. As necessary, users can exchange Peur for another cryptocurrency, or transfer it to a Fiat Money. To do this, it is enough to use a special mobile application.\nPeurCoin is a digital crypto-currency, compatible with ERC20, created on Blockchain Ethereum. This is a speculative cryptocurrency that can be used for short and long-term investments, transfer money to their peers, buy goods/services and as a currency for calculating wages.\n\n\n---\n\n**Thus, this means that there are no more banks, there are no more middlemen and only direct payments that can be made around the clock. The payment platform is available all over the world, without interrupting borders, countries or governments, making it a truly decentralized market.**\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n* [PEUR](https://peur.io/)\n* [WHITEPAPER](https://peur.io/getwhitepaper)\n* [FACEBOOK](https://www.facebook.com/Peurcoin)\n* [TWITTER](https://twitter.com/Peurtoken) \n* [BOUNTY](https://bountyhive.io/join/Peur)\n* [ABOUT PEUR](https://peur.io/video/peur-illustration.mp4)\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n**@Peurtoken** **#Peurtoken**",

            "text": "In the span of less than a month in July, two of the biggest exchanges in the world were either hacked or shut down. Bithumb, which regularly comprises around 25% of the world Ethereum trading volume, was hacked for billions of won. In the process, Bithumb users not only lost their money, but also had their names, phone numbers, and email addresses exposed.\n\nAround three weeks later, BTC-e, one of the oldest digital currency exchanges, was effectively shut down by the U.S. government. The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) laid down a $110 million USD fine against BTC-e, and a separate $12 million dollar fine for Alexander Vinnik, one of the operators of BTC-e.\n\nMore upsetting news came out when the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) released a link between BTC-e and the infamous Mt. Gox hacking, stating that BTC-e accounts \u201creceived substantial proceeds\u201d from Mt. Gox, and netted funds from Cryptowall, one of its biggest ransomware attacks. The U.S. DOJ condemned BTC-e, stating, \u201cBTC-e was an international money-laundering scheme that, by virtue of its business model, catered to criminals\u200a\u2014\u200aand to cyber criminals in particular.\u201d\n\nUpon reading this news, no one cant say which was more disturbing; the fact that Bithumb lost large sums of customer funds/private information, and is still somehow one of the largest exchanges in the world, or that BTC-e was running a giant money-laundering scheme right under our nose. BTC-e at least got shut down, but the Bithumb hacking didn\u2019t really seem to affect the exchange at all. Besides the outraged customers who were hacked, everyone else pretty much seemed to move on, business as usual.\n\nIt seems like everyone is just used to exchange hackings now. They\u2019ve become a part of the crypto industry. When there\u2019s a hacking, most people just think \u201cWhew, glad I didn\u2019t have funds in there\u201d and move on. When massive security breaches aren\u2019t met with much surprise anymore, there has to be a deeper underlying problem.\n\nThe main problem, is that there really are no viable alternatives to centralized exchanges at the moment. If someone hears that Bithumb got hacked and want to move funds away, where would he go? Probably go to another centralized exchange in Korea, like Coinone. The same problem still exists however. No one really knows how or why Bithumb got hacked, as the system is centralized, opaque, and closed. If someone moves funds to another centralized exchange, does any of that change? How do anybody get to know that the new exchange he sent funds to has better security protocols?\n\nGod forbid the OAX platform ever have a security breach, but if one were to occur, there are clear protocols in place. First of all, unlike centralized exchanges which hold both crypto and fiat private keys, Asset Gateways in the OAX platform will only have custody of a single set of keys. For example, with a fiat gateway, the gateway will only hold onto the fiat currency in a transaction, and the user will retain crypto custody. The vice versa applies for crypto gateways.\n\nAsset Gateways will also have transparent collateral levels, so that users can determine the amount of risk that they want to take on in a trade. The whole system will be open-sourced and transparent, so that everyone can check if there are potential loopholes. If the platform were to get hacked, it won\u2019t be just us knowing why it happened. Everyone would be able to see why the system got hacked, and make changes accordingly. Essentially, if we were running a giant money-laundering scheme like BTC-e, you\u2019d know about it. If thousands of our users had their funds and private information hacked, you\u2019d know how and why it happened.\n\nAt this point, people probably wondering about liquidity. Liquidity is the main reason why centralized exchanges are still popular even with all of the recent hackings. As mentioned previously, the Bithumb hacking barely made a dent in the overall business of the exchange, and its liquidity rankings are still consistently one of the best in the world. OAX hopes to solve the liquidity issue for decentralized exchanges by lowering entrance barriers for Asset Gateways and aggregating order books, which you can read more about in detail here.\n\nOAX believes, that someone, or some team, has to take charge and create an ecosystem that people can put their trust in. It doesn\u2019t have to be only OAX that leads this charge, even though we do believe strongly in the project. There seems to be some glimmer of a hint that regulation may be coming.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of the OAX platform, please read White Paper https://www.openanx.org/en/#whitePaper",

The aim of this blockchain solution is to empower entrepreneurs all over the world to build and operate decentralized firms that are free of restrictions, expensive intermediaries and extend across borders. This collaborative approach will help push more value into the products and also increase trust and resiliency in the company. EtherInc intends to be available all over the world to entrepreneurs wherever they need this critical service.\nHow EtherInc Ethereum Crypto Blockchain Fork Works\n\nEtherInc has successfully built what can be referred to as a comprehensive abstract foundation layer consisting of a blockchain network with an inbuilt programming language. This means anyone within the ecosystem will be able to create smart contracts as well as other decentralized apps in which they can establish their own ownership rules, state transition functions and transaction formats. This platform will be especially useful for creating decentralized apps, especially in situations where entrepreneurs are seeking fast development times and also the capability of different apps interacting efficiently.\n\nhttps://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/etherinc-ico-eti-token/",

Uchit utilizes the Ethereum ecosystem as its primary platform for transaction-processing.\n\nBy encrypting communications on the blockchain and allowing nodes to communicate directly, Uchit can function as a fully-decentralized exchange for transfer of data and value transactions - allowing users to communicate and collaborate at will. Distributed networks are able to collaborate in a trustless manner without a single point of failure.\n\nThis paper seeks to provide an overview of the Uchit protocol and explain its underlying technology and functionality in detail. We will break down the application\u2019s key components, compare it to existing non-blockchain P2P communication applications & collaboration applications, and explain how Uchit\u2019s unique approach to decentralized, contract-driven incentivization seeks to transform the blockchain communication & collaboration space.\n\nhttps://icobench.com/ico/uchit",

Uchit utilizies the Ethereum ecosystem as its primary platform for transaction processing.\n\nBy encrypting communication on the blockchain and allowing nodes to communicate directly, Uchit can function as a fully-decentralized exchange for transfer of data and value transaction\u200a\u2014\u200aallowing users to communicate and collaborate at will.

The idea is to drastically reduce the demand for paper, which is expected to put more pressure on forest ecosystems, as well as help reduce the carbon and ecological footprint.\n\nTo achieve this vision is not going to be an easy task. 4th Pillar is facing three main challenges including lack of a wallet system capable of sending multiple payments from organizations to individuals, lack of a mainstream blockchain based B2B and B2C work related sensitive document transfer, and lack of an online recruitment platform based on verified data.\n\nThe solutions to challenges are the creation of a 4th Pillar decentralized blockchain system for employers to reward and transfer FOUR tokens directly to their employees using a self-managed 4th pillar decentralized personal savings wallet. 4th Pillar will also use Blockchain and Interplanetary File Systems (IPFS) to provide efficiency in the secure transfer of valuable documents through its network directly from employer to employee. This will make room for creating a digital employee professional identity database with automated evaluation system to recruit based on verified work history.\n\nPlatform Services Sales.\n\nFour token is created as a utility token for the 4th Pillar platform. With an embedded token teleportation service and multiple transfer option, the FOUR token serves as an atomic unit and main component of the 4th Pillar ecosystem. As the platform uses Ethereum blockchain and token teleportation services in combination with 4th Pillar scalable cloud service, FOUR tokens will be used as the main value and gas. Other uses include a provision of community incentives and rewards, acts as a B2B payment medium, and as a main revenue mechanism in the 4th Pillar internal economy.\n\nOnce operational, on September 1st, 2018, FOUR tokens will earn the organization\u2019s gas fees from token transactions. 4th Pillar organization sells FOUR tokens in EUROs to organizations at market price. In addition, tokens will also be sold to recruiters and HR agencies as platform subscription.\n\nThe hard cap forecast of 12M capital will be raised through a Token Generation Event process over a 3-month period. TGE sales are booked through all periods for the years; 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. Sales driven organization is reaching over 3M EUR platform services sales in the 4th year. Middle Cap organization is reaching 3M EUR platform services sales with 4.3 EUR booked in years 2018 and 2019. On the other hand, TGE sales are booked in 2 year period for the Soft Cap with a sales driven organization reaching 2.5M EUR platform services sales in the 4th year.\n\nPossibilities for the Future.\n\nWhat makes 4th Pillar unique is the way it is conceptualized, developed and integrated into the business. The platform combines several solutions that solve many of the well-known HR pains. The project already has a developed working BETA for the first function including multi wallet value transfer. To go even further, the 4th Pillar platform has great possibilities for the future as it has the potential to expand and target the wider market due to the fact that it will offer multi-field solutions.\n\nMore information about the 4th Pillar is available at \u2013 https://www.the4thpillar.io/\n\nhttps://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/17/4th-pillar-using-blockchain-technology-solve-many-well-known-hr-pains/",

            "text": "The 4th Pillar, a blockchain-based human resources and finance connecting platform, has recently announced its Token Generation Event and public sale starting from April 2018. The platform intends to empower people to develop a verified professional history identity, personal decentralized savings crypto fund as well as send multiple cross-border payments, professional documents and make hiring based on verified data. The FOUR token serves as the main value over the platform, fuels and connects the 4th pillar ecosystem participants.\n\nThe Nature of the Platform\n\nThe 4th Pillar project is a partly private and partly public sale contribution-funded blockchain platform for individuals and organizations. Based on the Ethereum blockchain and teleportation service, the platform utilizes smart contracts, wallets and IPFS protocol to solve day-to-day problems experienced by organizations and their employers. For example, it offers:\n\nAn employee distributed professional database having a validated, automated, non-discriminatory evaluation system\nInexpensive international bank payments & bonus transfers\nWork-related P2P document distribution\nThe Background\n\nThe global recruitment and employment industry has been achieving an annual sales revenue of around \u20ac450.4 billion, with an annual increase of 8.6%. ILO modeled 2017 estimates, saying that out of the 7.6 billion world population, 3.3 billion people were employed. In terms of European Union population of 540 million, 215 million active employees are recorded.\n\nIn this scenario, one cannot estimate the volume of printing paper used for payroll slips, CVs, etc. It is nearly impossible to gauge the value of commissions paid to banks and other financial institutions for all the transactions related to employees.  One of the rising trends in the HR industry is the digitalization of processes, as a probable solution to the present HR challenges.  Around 38% of all businesses are already thinking about digital HR, while just 9% believe that they can adopt it at once.\n\nHow the 4th Pillar Addresses the Challenges?\n\nThe 4th Pillar gives back free choice and complete control over financial crypto savings to the people, eliminating the costs of intermediaries and solving the worker\u2019s digital identity problem and private documentation distribution (i.e. employment contracts, payroll slips, annexes, CVs, medical reports, performance reports, work history reports) at the same time.\n\nThe 4th Pillar platform lets organizations transfer digital value directly, eliminating the costs of middlemen. It is the world\u2019s first truly automated and validated employee evaluation system that all recruiters can use in a discrete manner.\n\nThe Benefits of the Platform\n\nThe decentralized blockchain technology and cryptography make the 4th Pillar ecosystem impervious to attacks and it can resist the influence of inflation. It offers the individuals a total control over their private information and enables them to earn FOUR tokens.\n\nThe 4th Pillar\u2019s validated automatic evaluation system is designed to be non-discriminatory and enables significant cost savings for organizations, as they can instantly send payments and paperwork-related documentation to any part of the world for a micro cost \u2013 directly to the employee\u2019s personal wallet. Moreover, for the first time in the world\u2019s history, organizations have a possibility to sign up employees to the partly blockchain-based database, where losing data is not an option.\n\nAbout FOUR Tokens\n\nThe platform offers three login options: login for individuals, organizations, and recruiters. When users will sign up for the DAPP (i.e. decentralized application) platform, they will have to complete KYC process, in order for their digital ID to be established.\n\nThe 4th Pillar (FOUR) tokens are the atomic units and internal currency of the 4th Pillar applications.  All 4th Pillar transactions, gas fees, and personal fund token transfers can be paid in 4th Pillar utility (FOUR) token.\n\nTo know more about the platform and participate in its upcoming TGE and Public sale, please visit https://www.the4thpillar.io/",

Each router owner can distribute free Wi-Fi, connect other users and earn cryptocurrency. In the end, all are winners: ordinary users do not have to pay for the Internet, routers owners receive revenue, and advertisers their target audience.\n\n**There are 3 key players in the chain:**\n\n\u25cf User\u200a\u2014\u200aa person who connects to an open network and after viewing the advertisement use Internet for free.\n\n\u25cf Owner of the router\u200a\u2014\u200agives access to an open network and earns on connection of other users.\n\n\u25cf Advertiser\u200a\u2014\u200abroadcasts advertising to its target audience, paying to the owner of the router.\n\nWeToken\u200a\u2014\u200ais the \u2018\u2019fuel\u2019\u2019 of WorldWifi. For each ad preview owner of the router gets tokens. WeToken will be based on Ethereum platform, because it allows easy and quick designing and testing of user scripts (Smart contracts) to implement WeToken and Dead logics.\n\nThe number of charged tokens per view depends on who this advertising is broadcasted to. The more solvent and targeted audience is concentrated in the network, the higher demand from advertisers and more advertisers are willing to pay for views. Accordingly, the more tokens the router owner receives.\n\nAccumulated tokens can be exchanged for another cryptocurrency or \u2018\u2019fiat\u2019\u2019 money on exchangers.\n\nDuring the ICO, tokens of the erc20 standard will be sold.\n\n**1 WeToken = $ 0.1\u200a\u2014\u200aat the ICO stage.**\n\n**The ICO is scheduled for January 25. The number of tokens is limited:**\n\n**A total of 600,000,000 WT will be produced.**\n\n**During the pre-ICO and ICO, 258 million WT will be available for purchase.**\n\nUnsold tokens will be burnt.\n\n**Cost of the token**\n\nThe cost of token will depend on the penetration of World Wi-Fi into the advertising market: from volume of the market formed by the project. The more penetration into the advertising market, the higher the price of the token. This is due to the fact that the market of tokens is growing, and their number remains fixed. As World Wi-Fi project develops, advertisers will buy more and more tokens from the market to be able to run advertising campaigns.\n\nMore details at r/worldwifi\n",

Take a look at a recent ICO \"UET - useless ethereum token\" it openly told investors they will get nothing yet investors bought into the ICO. \nso when you look at the whole ICO circus, there are 2 culprits. \n1) The ico's that never live up to the promises and investors get nothing\n2) The investor them self, who just want to join the party and buy into any thing that is labeled ICO...\nMy question is - what makes for a good ICO?\ndo you look at the project as important, the team behind the project or where the ico is listed ???\nMy opinion is 1stly to see the project and what budget is required ico's (soft cap) with NO soft cap in my humble opinion the ICO is shady..lol\nnumber 2 - what is the hard cap, ICO's with no hard cap doe snot make business sense. \nnumber 3 - The team - now this is a tricky part, many ICO's will bring in big names/celebs but we all know whats happened there after..lol - in my opinion if the team has people that have experience in the product they offering its a good start. A DJ knows how to spin disk's, what he knows of blockchain :)\nnumber 4 - ICO must be listed ranking and rating sites. this is where the crypto gurus analize the ICO. many rating sites that have experts rating the ICO's like - icoalert.com - icobench.com - icoratingzone.com - icomarks.com and there are many more.\n\nThis is just my way of looking at What makes for a good ICO.. what do think makes for a good ICO?

            "text": "As a great solution for the smart contracts to be used by everyone, DocTailer will be changing legal transactions from the ground up to allow ease of use. No developer experience? No problem. You can still use this platform to deploy smart contracts on the blockchain. According to research from Deloitte 46 percent of senior executives, such as CEOs and CFOs would like to use smart contracts on the blockchain and its decentralized applications. However, here is the curveball; many people think it is too technical. This, of course, includes managers and other highly trained individuals. Developers understand the technology but they tend to lack the capacity for the social know how to convince the legal and administrative people to the benefits of this technology. In addition, user-friendliness is the major problem is such situations, causing the technology to be viewed as \u201ctoo technical\u201d. Using this platform, anybody will be able to create custom smart contracts. Check out this student doing it :)\n\nType caption for image (optional)\n\nThe DocTailer platform will help users to produce legally binding smart contracts and everyone will be able to use blockchain ecosystems quickly, and it will be affordable. In addition to being affordable, if you are writing smart contracts, you will be able to make an income for yourself! Let's say someone needs a smart contract similar to yours. If you made your own smart contract available, other folks who want to use your contract will pay you DOCs, the token on the Ethereum network. Authors making money will accelerate the dissemination of the platform, making money for the investors. It is a win-win situation. If you are holding DOC tokens, they will distribute rewards to you every quarter. This is a good incentive to hold the tokens instead of selling them for FIAT or for ETH. Usually, tokens that have incentives for the investors to hold them tend to keep or increase their values. This platform has the capacity to disrupt multi-trillion dollar economies and sectors.\n...\nhttps://www.minds.com/blog/view/822143914161860608",

Here is their Main Promo : http://ivpages.net/show/2399/\n\nIce Rock Mining is a Bitcoin Mining Operation, that is set in a Retired but Technologically sound Military Soviet Bunker that was built into a Cold Mountain. The CEO of Ice Rock, Malik Murzashev, was a Bitcoin Mining hobbyist who saw the potential in the Cold Mountain as well as the Cheap Energy they source for .03 cents per KWH to keep costs down. Huge savings that make it a unique and energy efficient Mining Operation.\n\nEvery Month, depending on how much of the Rock2 (Second ICO) Token you hold in your wallet, you will receive your share of the profits in Ethereum deposited on the same day like Clockwork. Ice Rock also plans to scale the business constantly by using 20% of all mining profits every month to buy NEW MINERS so as to increase the total amount mined every month. Not only does it increase the amount mined, but more miners every month will overcome the rising difficulty of mining Bitcoin as time goes on.\n\nThis translates to an ever growing Ethereum income that the investors get to enjoy watching grow every month when they are paid.\n\nThe ICO is over halfway done, over 6 Million raised, and they start paying out July 29th. All coins that are not sold will be burned immediately, making Rock2 more scarce and giving investors more of a percentage of the future miners that will fill the bunker.\n\nThe telegram and Social media has exploded these past weeks, and has many admins on telegram to answer more questions you may have.\n\nRegister - https://ico.icerockmining.io/Account/Register?stcRef=ac472b91-46d3-4466-afef-90f1dc9c28c6\n\nHere are some Multiple high ratings from different ICO ratings websites, and a few other videos to get familiar with the Project:\n\nFound ICO rating 8.3 /10 - https://foundico.com/ru/ico/ice-rock-mining.html\n\nICO Marks 8.1 /10 Rating - https://icomarks.com/ico/ice-rock-mining\n\nTrack ICO 4.4 /5 - https://www.trackico.io/ico/ice-rock-mining/\n\nHere are some interviews with the team:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDls3HOE83s&t=170s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocED6vV8cKE&t=203s\n\nMAIN WEBSITE:\n\nhttps://icerockmining.io",

            "text": "Hey all,  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nFirst post under this account, but long time active member within the crypto community. BlockchainEconomics.io will be dedicated to analysis and insights on how the technology can transform our world. I\u2019ll be building the blog in the coming weeks, so check back on the site if you\u2019re interested in information about this space. In this first post, I\u2019ll utilize my background in conventional financial securities analysis to discuss some thoughts on what I feel to be an under-recognized new offering: WTT. Disclaimer: This is not to be construed as investment advice, simply my opinions on the Giga-Watt offering. Please consult with your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in getting involved in crypto mining, you should take a deeper look at this ICO. Giga-Watt claims to be the first full \u2018turnkey\u2019 mining solution. They offer a state-of-the-art facility, with custom engineered \u2018pods\u2019 designed specifically for housing mining equipment. They additionally facilitate group buys of miners, and install, maintain, and manage the equipment for you at no cost if you\u2019re a WTT holder. They also state they will provide an interface to oversee your miners, along with the ability to rent out any unutilized capacity in WTT\u2019s.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo what do you get for your purchase of WTT? The watt token (WTT) represents a 50 year right-to-property-use contract for 1 watt of energy, at a fixed all-in price of 3.3 cents per kilowatt hour (kwh). Essentially a 25%-50% discount over renting energy and space alone. Now, 1 watt doesn\u2019t go very far in mining so you\u2019ll need to consider your energy requirements if you\u2019re looking at utilizing the facility to house your miners. For example, the PandaMiner B3 Plus (GPU Miner for Ethereum), consumes 1250W + 10% for energy draw variability, for a total of 1375W. Each. At the current rate of $1.05 USD per WTT, you\u2019ll need to spend $1443.75 to purchase enough capacity for one Panda miner. We\u2019ll take a look at some of the numbers shortly to determine if this is a good deal or not. One comment I\u2019ll add regarding the 50 year lease contract is that it is largely marketing fluff. It\u2019s unrealistic to assume you\u2019ll utilize the facility for that time frame. The more likely scenario is 5 years, 10 years max, and are safer estimates to use in our calculations.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the math:\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 1: Break-Even Analysis**  \n\n  WTT tokens enable the user to utilize the mining facility at an all-in cost of 3.3\u20b5 per kwh. Ignoring the ability to resell the token at some point in the future, how long would it take to break even versus your mining costs at home (also assumes you have access to similar capacity)? Let\u2019s use 10,000 watts in this example, and $1.075 per WTT given the current phase of the ICO (equal weighting $1.05 and $1.10):\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Local Cost per KWH**|**Savings per KWH**|**X10 KWH (10,000W)**|**Mining Hours for Break Even**\n:-------------------------:|:-----------------------:|:---------------------------:|:----------------------------------:\n.05 (Russia)|$.017|$0.17|63,235 (7.22 Years)\n.10 (USA / China)|$.067|$0.67|16,044 (1.83 Years)\n.15 (UK)|$.117|$1.17|9,188 (1.05 Years)\n.22 (Japan)|$.187|$1.87|5,749 (0.66 Years)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n  I used energy cost estimates directly from http://giga-watt.com, so I can\u2019t personally ensure the accuracy by region, but the math is the same either way. It is already looking attractive from this perspective, and we also make the unrealistic assumption that the WTT token will be worthless in all time periods prior to the 50 year expiration. In all but the most aggressive (lowest native cost) regions, you can fully recover your WTT costs purely from energy cost-savings within 2 years. While you can still use their facility and rent out space at a modestly higher cost without WTT, the up-front capital expenditure can pay for itself relatively quickly. It does make a point that you should be considering your local energy costs and mining time frame prior to jumping into this.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n  **Scenario 2: Discounted Cash Flows**  \n\n  This scenario directly considers the income generated from rented capacity, and also factors in several terminal value (sale price) possibilities in calculating a net present value (NPV). We\u2019ll continue with our purchase of 10,000 WTT at an average price of $1.075/ea, for a total cost of $10,750. I\u2019m going to use an \u2018aggressive\u2019 discount rate, since we operate in the crypto space with sizable return potential (should you decide to dedicate this capital to other crypto investments). The net rental income represents the hourly income due to you, after paying your 3.3\u20b5 per kwh. We will use a 3 year holding period, discounting semi-annually. Rental rates are based on those available in the calculator on their site.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Hourly Income Rate**|**Net Hourly Rental Income Rate**|**Net Hourly Rental Income**|**Discount Rate per Year**|**WTT Terminal Value(% of Purchase Price)**|**WTT Terminal Value**|**Net Present Value**\n:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:\n$0.075|$0.042|$0.42|10%|0%|$0|($1,413)\n|||||50%|$5,375|$2,598\n|||||100%|$10,750|$6,609\n|||||200%|$21,500|$14,630\n$0.0825|$0.0495|$0.495|10%|0%|$0|$255\n|||||50%|$5,375|$4,266\n|||||100%|$10,750|$8,276\n|||||200%|$21,500|$16,298\n$0.09|$0.057|$0.57|10%|0%|$0|$1,922\n|||||50%|$5,375|$5,933\n|||||100%|$10,750|$9,944\n|||||200%|$21,500|$17,966\n\n&nbsp;\n\n  Generally speaking, the very broad conclusion we can draw from NPV is that any scenario with a positive value should be considered a viable investment option. Put another way, you could invest an additional amount at inception equal to the NPV value, and have a result of zero in the calculation. Any value larger than zero means you received a return greater than your required rate of return, which was 10% in our examples. It is important to point out that our first scenario with $.042 per kwh rental and $0.00 terminal value on WTT resulted in a negative value, indicating the return was less than 10% over the three year time frame. Nevertheless, the fact that the other scenarios all returned positive values is a good indication of the opportunity present. As I said, you\u2019ll need to discuss these hypothetical examples, along with numerous other individual factors, with your financial advisor to determine if this is a suitable investment vehicle for you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n  Bear in mind that this analysis does not consider mining profitability, nor the cost of your equipment. This is strictly an analysis of the WTT token\u2019s value. A brief summary of pros and cons below:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n  Pros:  \n*\tTangible facility with experienced team  \n*\tClaim they will fully maintain and manage your equipment on-site, 24/7  \n*\tPositive cash flows on rented tokens \u2013 2-3 year ROI based on estimates  \n*\tDiscounted mining if you have access to hardware  \n*\tPotential to resell tokens later at a premium, should mining rewards justify a higher expense  \n*\tSignificantly higher capacity than you could undertake at a private residence  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n  Cons:  \n*\tLimited diversification in coin mining types (for now)  \n*\tCost of energy as a whole can decrease  \n*\tPOW style mining becoming less prevalent in \u2018token\u2019 types  \n*\tLimited access to owned miners due to facility location  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI hope you found this review helpful in your decision making.

In order to maintain a rapid approval process, the system works on a first-come,first-served basis. Therefore the first approver who correctly checks and approves a particular content is rewarded. But wait what if approvers validate/ approve bad content ?The higher the accuracy in classifying contents, the higher the ranking. A content is classified correctly when an approver\u2019s choice is consistent with the choice of all the other approvers that checked that same content. After a high number of mistakes, the approver falls below a minimum threshold and is automatically disqualified and removed from the approval system. Thus users and approvers are motivated to create and approve good content\n\nsocial media:\n\nThe platforms on which contents are published. We track the figures in terms of the number of likes, interactions and comments.\n\nbenefits of Friends token\n\nThe company is beginning to establish partnerships with more than 150 major e-commerce platforms in Europe and are working hard to continue expanding our network.

            "text": "TLDR: **Mercury Protocol = Dust app with *\"blockchain*\" lipstick to get some $$$**\n\nAfter u/mcuban had his spat with the SEC in 2013 he backed [dustapp](https://www.usedust.com/), yet another messaging app that touts privacy features.\n\nTo say the least, **the app bombed**. Using it was difficult and the use case wasn't clear either. What could it do better than say Telegram or Whatsapp? \n\nIt received [terrible reviews](https://www.greenbot.com/article/2462430/cyber-dust-review-mark-cubans-private-messaging-app-is-just-too-inconvenient.html) and never really caught on. As of today, the app [hasn't even breached 4,000 downloads on android](https://imgur.com/a/yDz7x) and the [link to the iOS app is broken](https://imgur.com/a/3Qcap). Apart of communicating software issues [their last tweet was in July 2016](https://twitter.com/dustmessaging) and [their facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/dustmessaging) was last updated in November 2016. Nearly a year ago... It's basically dead in the water.\n\nAlong comes Ethereum and the ICO market craze. Everybody is raising millions the easy way. Cuban is not one who likes to lose money. Or leave out an opportunity to leave easy money on the table. The idea for Mercury Protocol is born... Use the existing Dust app, decentralize and tokenize it, have an ICO and PROFIT!\n\nThis is how Mercury Protocol came around. It's just a version of the Dust app using the blockchain lipstick to lure in investors for their ICO. \n\nEnter Preethi Kasireddy. She joined Mercury Protocol [a mere two months ago](https://twitter.com/iam_preethi/status/900792172299112448) shortly before u/mcuban announced Mercury Protocol.\nShe's got everything one needs for a successful ICO. She's smart and competent and her CV reads great. Mathlete at school, 4.0 GPA, Goldman Sachs, Andreessen Horowitz, she's a coder and she's got a great social following. Everything checks out.\n\nHer CV is way to slick though. Not to imply that she's not as good as it states, I'm confident she is. But she won't be sticking around for long. This will be a 6-12 month stint for her, the moment she reaches her bonus cliff she'll be out of there. In hindsight she'll acknowledge that the project had serious flaws, but it was a great opportunity to be part of and she totally had the intention of making the world a better place with Mercury Protocol... yada, yada, yada....\n\nLet me be clear that, I'm biased about Mercury Protocol. For the simple reason that I hold mercuryprotocol.eth, the ENS domain, which I've offered them. \n\nWhat's an ENS domain? Simply put, it makes an ethereum address humanly readable. The same way that 157.166.226.26 is an IP address and CNN.com is the humanly readable domain name. Basically you can assign an ethereum wallet to mercuryprotocol.eth and have people send their funds there for the ICO instead of 0x948ed55D0777c4341e29e244DB9678F2104395B1 or so.\n\nOne would think this would be very valuable to the project. They want users to pay for using the dapp and they're holding an ICO. This is why [I wrote Mark Cuban a message](https://imgur.com/a/7ofE5) during their AMA, offering it to them. \n\nI also tweeted about it, trying to get their attention. No response what so ever. Why? How would owning the domain not be vital to them?\n\nThat's what got me thinking, and that's when I realized what's going on.\n\nI'm predicting that the project will fail, Preethi will leave the team within 12 months and the value of the token will tank and be substantially below the ICO price.\n\n**EDITS:**\n\n**update on 12/01/2017**: Preethi Kasireddy is [no longer listed](https://www.mercuryprotocol.com/about) as part of the Team or the Advisors of mercuryprotocol.",

So what is the main benefits and opportunities of technology that is given by the Stream.space? Here are some: \n\nTransparency is one of the most significant blockchain improvements. There are no intermediaries involved in the process. It uses a decentralized network. It creates trust among network participants who, although they have never seen each other, can make transactions with each other. Safety is provided through traceability. All the data entered in blockchain are immutable, unalterable or unmodifiable. Blockchain can be easily auditable. It offers multiple uses; almost any type of assets can be recorded in it. The technology is quite affordable, without the need for large investments or complex infrastructures. There are already blockchain- based platforms like Ethereum and Stream.space that allow us to create decentralized applications Stream.space offers reduced cost since with a single book it is possible to keep records of transactions made. How it is distributed helps to increase the speed of the transaction. This is because it eliminates intermediaries and everyone can audit and verify the information registered in it.

Its security is ensured through the use of one of the soundest and most reliable currency backings there is: real estate. \nMany of those who are looking to invest their earnings face the dilemma of putting their savings into low interest rate bank accounts or lacking other investment alternatives due to a lack of liquidity. \nThe world\u2019s widely used fiat currencies are backed by no real commodities. REcoin is backed by real estate in countries with a developed and stable economy such as the United States, Canada, the U.K. and Switzerland.\n\n**How Does REcoin Work?**\n\n\nReCoin users purchase the REcoin currency as an alternative to storing their savings bank accounts or other options, converting their money into a more stable and secure investment.\nThe value of the currency can grow at least two ways: through the steady increasing value of the real estate investments that ReCoin is used to purchase, and a higher ReCoin value when the demand for REcoin rises.\nThe management of the REcoin supply and its security is guaranteed through the latest blockchain cryptocurrency technology. \nREcoin offers its users an easy and intuitive buying and selling process, and furthermore it is designed to be easily used as a currency alternative for a full range real estate transactions and services.\n\n**The Unique Advantages of REcoin.**\n\n\nReCoin offers numerous distinct advantages compared to other currencies and real estate purchasing methods.\n\n\u25cf\tReCoin simplifies and speeds up real estate transactions and allows independence from several traditional third-parties involved in real estate transactions. \n\n\u25cf\tReCoin lowers the cost of real estate transactions by limiting third-parties and increasing their speed, allowing for greater profitability for brokers, agents, and lower prices for buyers.\n\n\u25cf\tReCoin offers a new international real estate marketplace and facilitates connections for investors, brokers, and real estate sellers. \n\n**REcoin\u2019s Guarantees.**\n\n\nReCoin offers several guarantees to its users to protect their investment: \n\n\u25cf\tReCoin\u2019s activities are in full compliance and governed by United States law. \n\n\u25cf\t100% of our proceeds from ReCoin sales minus maintenance costs are invested into real estate.\n\n\u25cf\tIn worst-case scenarios, The ReCoin Trust guarantees a liquidity ratio of up to 70% of the currency\u2019s market value. Compare this to the Federal Reserve requirement for liquidity ratios for financial institutions, which is set at a maximum of 10%.\n\n\u25cf\tThe ReCoin Purse is secured by the latest cryptocurrency tools and designed to be user-friendly and convenient.\n\n\u25cf\tNew technical and economic solutions will be developed for the benefit of ReCoin users.\n\n**Smart Contracts.**\n\n\nAs one of its most important features, ReCoin implements Smart Contracts which are implemented from Ethereum, the most widely used secure smart-contract platform. \nSmart contracts are algorithms that facilitate, automate, verify or enforce financial contracts. They are designed to reduce the traditional costs and time associated with developing and enforcing contracts through the use of automatically enforced contractual conditions.\nIn the world of real estate, smart contracts can be used to ensure that payment terms, service fees or liens are paid for once the contract is executed. Smart contracts allow for cryptocurrencies like ReCoin to be safely used as working capital for real estate transactions.\n\n**Why Should You Use ReCoin?**\n\n\n\u25cf\tPreserve your wealth by converting it from unstable and uncertain currency into a cryptocurrency solely used for stable and secure real estate investments.\n\n\u25cf\tA safer, easier and faster way for real estate buyers and sellers throughout the world to find investments, close real estate deals and securely pay for their transactions.\n\n\u25cf\tUse ReCoin for less expensive and more efficient real estate transactions and services with limited third-party involvement and a lower overall cost.\n\n\u25cf\tUse ReCoin to invest in the most widely known and trusted global charities.\n",

I also collected a hefty dividend about a month ago and it\u2019s then and there when I knew dividend tokens were for me. I have seen too many people get burned buying at coin tops out of pure fomo with nothing to look forward to but hopefully some sort of a return in a year or two. I waited for quite some time for another dividend casino token to be developed which followed a similar path such as Etheroll. I fully believe Ethino will be either a perfect token to flip or a great hold with its profit sharing dividend.(I\u2019m holding) They created a Casino War game currently (full casino games later) which will allow for ERC20 tokens to be wagered or paid out. You would be able to gambled OMG, GNT, ZRX DICE or any token really. Pretty cool idea.\n\n\n-Ethino has a working Alpha on the Rinkeby testnet. Pretty fun as well (A real alpha fully running on the blockchain)\nhttps://www.ethino.com/alpha/ \n* They also just implemented a TrollBox/ChatBox as well\n\n-Communication has been on point with my many, many questions\n\n-Great and thorough white paper check it out : http://www.ethino.com/files/ethino-whitepaper.pdf \n \n-Super low market cap currently with a 50% token  burn built into the contract\n\n-Generous social media bounty too of up to $500k +: https://medium.com/@Ethino_Casino/ethino-bounty-launch-222837118f6\n\nI feel that once people actually look at this project and realize it\u2019s valued way too low currently for what they already have, the ICO will quickly start to fill up. Just checkout the other valuation of casino\u2019s and you will see what I mean.\n\n\nDisclaimer: Please do your own due diligence. Of course every ICO is a risk and everyone must outweigh the risk to reward for themselves.  \n\nI currently own DICE and ENO tokens and used to hold FUN tokens.\n\n**ICO is Live and they have a 24% bonus currently**: Ethino Website: https://ethino.com\n\nGambling has been around since forever and with the creation of the Ethereum blockchain you now have actual provable fairness which has never existed before until today.

            "text": "I\u2019ve been investing in ICO\u2019s for about 8 months. I\u2019ve had my high and my lows, but learned a lot along the way. After researching dozens of ICO\u2019s, reading their whitepapers and scanning their teams, it\u2019s not hard to pick out the real winners anymore. Actually, I don\u2019t think picking out the real winners was ever the problem. \n\nThe real problem is getting into them. Even more so nowadays than it was before. This is due to the change in the ICO environment where the biggest ICO\u2019s completely or almost completely sell out during their private sales, where the whales scoop up all the coins and leave the smaller investors to buy them on exchanges for a much higher price. And thus, the richer get richer.\n\nSo let\u2019s make the less fortunate rich as well! Me and a friend have started an investment pool in which we gather funds to be able to participate in the private sales of ICO\u2019s. The pool currently consists of close to 100 active members. In the pool we share a spreadsheet in which we\u2019ve shown our research and our progress towards achieving private deals. We are using a pledging form to see if people are interested in certain ICO\u2019s and will than open the pool so that people can participate. We try to keep the group as clean and serious as possible, and have a strict policy towards people who don\u2019t comply with our rules.\n\nFor the pools we are using Primablock, of which more information can be found in our group. Primablock is a service for for ethereum pooling, which has an easy to use UI for people participating in the pool. Unfortunately the pools aren\u2019t 100% trust less, but we are trying to be as transparent as possible.\nIf you are an ICO enthusiast and want to join in private deal opportunities to join the greatest projects and receive some nice bonuses, send me a PM for more details. If you have any questions, feel free to post them below.\n\n\n**TL;DR We\u2019ve created a pool to gather funds so that we are able to participate in private sales of ICO\u2019s which would otherwise sell out before the smaller investors can even participate.**\n",

The global drilling waste management market is worth US$ 5.08 billion.\n\n  \n**Why:** As they will reduce the cost and increase the efficiency and transparency of transactions between oil companies and drill waste management service providers via bespoke smart contracts, OILSC coins will become the preferred industry standard medium of exchange, thereby driving the value of OILSC coins upward.\n\n\n**Cost:** The ICO sale price is 3,850 tokens for 1 ETH, the minimum contribution is 0.1 ETH (385 tokens). All contributions of 3 ETH will receive a 25% extra allocation and all contributions of 5ETH or more will receive a further 40% allocation.\n\n130 million will be offered in the ICO token sales. 50 million OILSC tokens will be held by Oil and Gas Supply Chain for future expansion and development rewards, marketing, incentives and back office.\n\n\n\n\n**Marketing Blurb**\n\n\n*With co-operation from many of the world\u2019s largest companies, governments and organizations that specialize in oil and gas waste disposal, we are moving their supply chains and contracts onto the blockchain. Using bespoke smart contract GUI\u2019s that conform to the current layouts on our platform, OILSC will make this process more time and cost effective and move it closer to worldwide compliance and a cleaner world.*\n\n\n\n*The Oil and Gas Supply Chain token is designed to be the medium of transaction within a smart contract between the oil and gas companies themselves and all the drill management and waste disposal service providers. OILSC token is supported by major companies and organizations with years of experience in providing full service drilling waste management, solids control and complete \u2018backyard\u2019 solutions to required post drilling environmental protection regulations worldwide. These companies and organizations are the base from which OILSC will be transacted.*\n\n\n\n*The Oil & Gas Supply Chain platform is currently in it's early stage development. Please click here to view progress.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Roadmap :**\n\n\nThe project started in 2016 with an agreement signed in Q4 with major Oil and Gas waste disposal companies worldwide.\n\nQ1-Q3 2017 :: smart contracts defined/agreement signed with participants. OILSC token and smart contracts produced  for token sale. \n\nQ4 :: MOU signed with blockchain specialist company SIMFORM to develop the App/ Platform/ GUI\n\n\n\n**The DEV TEAM**\n\n\n\n\n\n**David Clark :: Head of Development**\n\n\nHis background is in IT having previously ran a computer business in the late 1980.

Their descriptions on OILSC.io are matching with those on haven-associates.com \n\n\nThe people are real, the experience and industry background is there. I believe this is an opportunity. If they take your money and run at least you know where to find them. Hint: neither in UK nor Seychelles.\n\n\n\n\n**THE WHITEPAPER**\n\n\n\n**Why would the companies use your tokens/smart contracts to clear contracts?**\n\nWith the globalization of trade there is increasing complexity and lack of transparency in supply chains. This increases the amount of information asymmetry \u2013 such that information is unevenly distributed among participating stakeholders within a supply chain. When these stakeholders have misaligned incentives, there is no incentive to provide information, which contributes further to information asymmetry. As a result, end buyers of products have no economical way of authenticating what they are purchasing, which creates ideal conditions for moral hazard and fraudulent behaviour. \n\n\n**How two or more companies would operate these contracts?**\n\n\nThe companies will have to provide a set of pre-defined/ commonly agreed information data, which will be standardized and vetted on the OILSC protocol. The protocol will perform a consensus check that verifies there are no discrepancies between data provided by different stakeholders. \n\nA smart contract will be pre-defined and all interested parties can see the terms of the agreement. Certain expectations have to be met, when the signatories meet those expectations, the contracts can be fulfilled.\n\n\n\n**OILSC protocol can be applied in other industries**\n\nMoving the water H2O sector on the blockchain:\n\nThe average onshore oil well produces ten times the volume of water as oil, all day, and every day. In fact, the cost of dealing with this produced water is the primary cost of operating an oil or gas well. \nMoving, treating and disposing of the water is half to two-thirds of the total cost of producing each barrel of oil.\n\nOil and Gas Supply Chain can implement smart contracts on its platform; an efficient water marketplace is going to lead to more recycling, more conservation, and more investments into water treatment technologies. Not limited to the energy sector, a marketplace model has the potential to improve sustainability for every major off-grid user including agriculture and industry. With an effective system in place, all kinds of water, not just freshwater, can be appropriately valued, traded, and put to its best use.\n\n**TERMS AND CONDITIONS**\n\n    I would urge everyone to read on theirs terms and conditions.\n\nActually let me rephrase this, read the terms and conditions of any project that you are looking to invest into.\n\nOILSC Tokens are utility tokens; the value of the OILSC Tokens is not tied to the performance of OILSC Technologies (the Company). Management of the Company understands that the \nOILSC Token is not a security and is therefore not generally regulated securities agencies. However, the Company does not claim to know the laws of the specific jurisdiction in which a contributor is domiciled. It is the responsibility of the contributor to know and understand the laws to which it is subject.\n\n\nOil and Gas Supply Chain supports many different blockchain implementations. The current version of Oil and Gas Supply Chain utilizes Ethereum blockchain to provide proof of concept and initial implementation. The fully developed solution will provide interfaces to many different blockchains.\n\n\nAnother point to take into consideration is that  Oil and Gas Supply Chain uses a blockchain layer which presents an independent system and thus adds additional cost depending on the chosen underlying blockchain for some Oil and Gas Supply Chain functionalities. \n\n\nIn case of Ethereum being the underlying blockchain, this means that a small amount of Gas (Ether) is also needed to store the necessary hashes on Ethereum for storage operations.\n\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI like what I\u2019m seeing in the whitepaper regarding the moving of oil and suppliers contracts on the blockchain. I don\u2019t have a background in oil and gas so I am not familiar with the industry unfortunately. Also I\u2019m not sure how open this area is for innovation but I guess since we are talking about private companies and if this project can save them time and money I believe it could have some success. \n\nIt is also important to acknowledge the fact that there are other projects who are trying to move the supply chain contracts on the blockchain, apparently backed by huge corporations.\n\nOILSC is targeting the sector dealing with the waste produced after the extraction of oil and gas, which could be considered as a niche in the entire OIL& GAS industry. \n\nHowever if one of the other projects gain more popularity I don\u2019t see it hard to build something aimed at the waste management contracts, so please keep in mind that there is a risk that a competitor might come along at a later stage.\n",

            "text": "I\u2019ve been investing in ICO\u2019s for about 8 months. I\u2019ve had my high and my lows, but learned a lot along the way. After researching dozens of ICO\u2019s, reading their whitepapers and scanning their teams, it\u2019s not hard to pick out the real winners anymore. Actually, I don\u2019t think picking out the real winners was ever the problem.\n\nThe real problem is getting into them. Even more so nowadays than it was before. This is due to the change in the ICO environment where the biggest ICO\u2019s completely or almost completely sell out during their private sales, where the whales scoop up all the coins and leave the smaller investors to buy them on exchanges for a much higher price. And thus, the richer get richer.\n\nSo let\u2019s combine our powers! Me and a friend have started an investment pool in which we gather funds to be able to participate in the private sales of ICO\u2019s. The pool currently consists of close to 100 active members. In the pool we share a spreadsheet in which we\u2019ve shown our research and our progress towards achieving private deals. We are using a pledging form to see if people are interested in certain ICO\u2019s and will than open the pool so that people can participate. We try to keep the group as clean and serious as possible, and have a strict policy towards people who don\u2019t comply with our rules.\n\nFor the pools we are using Primablock, of which more information can be found in our group. Primablock is a service for for ethereum pooling, which has an easy to use UI for people participating in the pool. Unfortunately the pools aren\u2019t 100% trust less, but we are trying to be as transparent as possible. If you are an ICO enthusiast and want to join in private deal opportunities to join the greatest projects and receive some nice bonuses, send me a PM for more details. If you have any questions, feel free to post them below.\n\n**TL;DR We\u2019ve created a pool to gather funds so that we are able to participate in private sales of ICO\u2019s which would otherwise sell out before the smaller investors can even participate.**",

Even pay a small fee to Hack.Ether.Camp. \n\nBut the HKG token has zero functional value other than to appease an artificial barrier (you can't invest in the startups without it).\n\nAnother thing that is worrying from the whitepaper is that immediately after each startup's token sale during the incubation period, there's another crowdsale with 5x tokens. Why in the world would I buy in initially when there's more risk if my investment will immediately be diluted when the project finishes the Hack.Ether.Camp program?\n\nAlso I read through the forum and the founder can barely express his opinions in fluent English which is concerning.\n\nThere's a lot about this project that makes no sense to me, but again I think it's a good idea in theory. I'm really interested to hear other people's thoughts on this.",

            "text": "How secure is your ICO investment?\n\nAre you aware that nearly anyone has the capability to design a white paper, set up a landing page and attach a wallet address?\n\n\nPhoto by Ram\u00f3n Salinero on Unsplash\nYes, that\u2019s reality. For this reason that anyone who chooses to invest must be extremely careful to avoid being a victim of scams. This does not mean that there aren\u2019t any legit companies offering an ICO; however, it does mean that the investor must have a keen eye.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what to consider before investing in an ICO, then it could be quite a challenge. Even though investing in ICO can be risky, you can protect yourself as an investor by scrutinizing 5 key factors.\n\n1) Team Composition\n\nIs the company willing to publish information about its team members?\n\nMost legitimate companies initiating an ICO have no problem with providing investors with information about their team.\n\nHowever, you should ensure that team bios are detailed, and fully outline the team member\u2019s past experience and accomplishments. You should look at their level of experience in the field of cryptocurrency, and what their past records say about them.\n\nOr if the team member is new to the crypto world, they should still be able to provide detailed information about their skill set, and how it contributes to the overall goal of the ICO.\n\n2) White Paper\n\nThis document is probably the most important element in an ICO. This document describes everything about the project which includes the idea, technology driving it, dissemination of tokens and how it is going to be utilized. It should also include the rights of the users and other important information.\n\nThe white paper should be well structured with the good logical flow. If a company is offering an ICO with shallow details, or fails to provide a whitepaper at all then, it should arouse some suspicion.\n\n3) Community Communications\n\nWhat is the frequency of communication with their future investors? Do they display accountability?\n\nA company should provide potential investors with answers to questions via social media or the company\u2019s blog. Analyze the company\u2019s answers to questions interested investors have about the technology behind the ICO. How viable is the project? What trends are likely to influence the project?\n\nDoes the company communicate how they intend to utilize the funds to be raised? Is the reason convincing enough?\n\nYou should only invest when you are satisfied with the answers they provide to these questions.\n\n4) Foundation\n\nYou should consider which kind of blockchain their project is designed on. Many startups use ERC20. If not, then they must be using a custom decentralized blockchain \u2014 an impressive proposition.\n\nHowever, 91% of largest tokens circulating through market capitalization use the Ethereum computing platform, due to its simple and open architecture. If the ICO you\u2019re considering in investing in doesn\u2019t use Ethereum, you should question why.\n\n5) Suitable Token Dissemination\n\nYou need to know how many tokens are offered for presale and the number of ICO participants, and how many tokens the team reserves for themselves.\n\nWhere the value of every token is considerably high, and billions of them are circulating, then the company\u2019s funding objectives are not realistic.\n\nKnowing the value of each coin in line to its foundation and how they are shared among investors is important.\n\nConclusion\n\n<quoted>\nBy thoroughly investigating the 5 criteria listed above when you consider any ICO investment, you will reduce your level of risk.\n\nIf you are looking to invest in an ICO that is verified and meets all the above conditions, then look no further because CrowdCoinage.com meets and exceeds these criteria. Visit our website today and discover one of the most exciting and ambitious ICOs of 2018.<quoted>",

            "text": "Unfair access to food and raw materials still exists as a global issue, due to the centralization of commodity exchanges and the barriers for traders to access them equally. Chaintrade aims to contribute to the solution of this issue by allowing anyone to buy and sell those fundamental products, irrespective of their country or wealth.\n\nChaintrade is based on the CTC (ChainTrade Coin) which is used for all trading activities on the platform, including but not limited to trading, settlement of contracts and insurance. \n\nFor now, the ChainTrade platform allows the trading of options and futures on commodities only (food and raw materials). \nChainTrade's ecosystem consists of Traders (food and raw materials producers, buyers or speculators), Insurers and Smart Contracts. \n\n\n**What makes ChainTrade unique**\n\n\nChainTrade's trading platform will be based on Ethereum blockchain and will utilize Smart Contracts to facilitate the execution of contracts. This will result in a lean and efficient platform with significantly lower fees than current centralized commodities exchange, making it easier and more profitable for all stakeholders to trade derivatives on food and raw materials.\n\nChainTrade will provide a platform that will allow smaller investors to participate in the trading process with minimal initial capital. Any investor will be able to purchase the CTC token on cryptocurrency exchanges which will give instant access to the trading platform. All traders worldwide will have equal access to the platform, with no special advantages such as co-locates servers or better fees for bigger investors.\n\nChainTrade's plan includes several aspects aiming at ensuring a high liquidity of the Smart Contracts. ChainTrade's processes and interface will be designed  to attract traders from traditional exchanges .\n\nKYC and AML processes will be made more efficient thanks to artificial intelligence/machine learning.\n\n\n**Business Strategy**\n\n\nChainTrade will pursue a strategy of aggresive marketing and sales to achieve its goal of securing 5% of the global volume of food and raw materials trading by 2020\n\nBased on its market research and estimate of potential, ChainTrade aims to reach 500 million transactions in 2020.\n\n\n**Token Sale**\n\n\nThe number of CTC tokens available will be limited to 225 million.\nInitial Token Sale is schedules to run from 9th of October 2017 to 31st of December 2017. Raising proceeds through the Initial Token Sale will provide the required funds to launch and operate the ChainTrade platform while giving purchasers a token required to access and use the platfrom. The objective is to release the CTC token into circulation and set an initial market price. \nThe token price is 1 ETH for 1000 CTC (i.e. 1CTC = 0.001 ETH). CTC token will be listed on crypto-exchanges in November.\n\nYou may find more information here: https://chaintrade.net/\n",

            "text": "Before launching an ICO, you might be interested in what an ICO actually means. Here is a short definition.\n\nWHAT IS AN ICO?\nICO stands for Initial Coin Offering. It\u2019s an event, sometimes referred to as \u2018crowdsale\u2019, when a company releases its own crypto coins or tokens with the purpose of funding. A company usually releases a certain number of crypto tokens and then sells those tokens to its intended audience, most commonly in exchange for Ether. So basically it is a new, worldwide, fast way to raise money for crypto-related startups. Currently, ICOs are not or hardly ever regulated.\nIn this post, I would like to go over 10 tips and offer advice before deciding to start an ICO.\nIn 2016 and in the first quarter of 2017 nearly all ICOs could raise millions of dollars. However, around March 2017 things changed and tons of ICO appeared and many of them were SCAMS.\n\n1. Have a good Idea\nHaving a good idea is very important. Whether it\u2019s a new concept or improving an existing service or product, make sure it can be achieved.\nYou do not want to spend your time concentrating on something that is completely impossible to achieve. In other words, do not promise something that you can not deliver to your investors.\n2. Have an Idea? Then make a plan\nCreate a plan on paper that states what the project is about and what purpose the project will fulfill upon completion. Decide how much money will be needed to undertake your venture and how many virtual tokens your investors will keep for themselves. Decide what type of money will be accepted and how long your ICO campaign will run. Write down all the important details in order for your investors have a clear understanding of your business plan. Clearly, state how many tokens will be available and in distribution. Investors need to know how many tokens will be circulating and how many your company will be keeping for itself.\n3. Have your team\nEven if you believe an ICO startup can be a one-man show, your chances of success will be a great deal less if you attempt to do it on your own. You need software developers, blockchain developers, website front end and back end developers. You need someone who will deal with people who are interested in your project and will ask you any questions they might have. You will need legal advisors and coworkers, depending on the size of your project and your startup budget.\nICO fundraising is done by a smart contract. You might have to hire an expert to write the smart contract for you. If you write it yourself, then at least have an expert to audit it.\n\n4. Spread your project\n\nIt is important that from the very first day you build and support the community. Help them, share, contribute free and valuable information\u200a\u2014\u200abe a part of the crypto community.\nUse forums, social media, and communicate with them on different channels like Telegram, Reddit, and bitcointalk.org. List your ICO on as many platforms as you can. There are some good ICO calendars and ICO listing websites such as listico.io, coinschedule.com, icoalert.com. Use Google Adwords, Facebook Ads, and Twitter Ads if you can afford it. Try to grab as much attention as you possibly can.\n \n5. Prepare for the ICO launch\nA new trend started in 2017 known as \u201cPRE-ICO\u201d. You can use a PRE-ICO, if you wish, to collect some funds before the main sale. Usually, during the PRE-ICO sale, you offer big discounts for your tokens compared to the main ICO sale. For example with PRE-ICO, you sell your token for 1eth = 100 tokens. On PRE-ICO you give 30% discount 1eth = 130 tokens.\nYou can use the raised funds to advertise your main event.\n6. Launch the ICO\nLaunch your ICO\u200a\u2014\u200aif you get to this point, then basically your smart contract kicks in automatically on a certain day or at a certain block number. This is usually written in an open software platform or Ethereum network. People can send ether to your smart contract which is automatically calculating the ether then your token exchange rate issues the token and sends it to the buyer.\n\n7. Monitor and communicate \nDuring the ICO you should monitor if everything is going ok with the token issuing and the ether that has been collected is going to your address without any issues. Check if the smart contract address is correct. (Hackers and scammers could attack you from different directions)\n8. Secure your funds\nWhen the ICO is over, secure your raised funds. If you have a really successful ICO you can raise millions of dollars and become a potential target of hackers.\n9. Work on the project\nThis is very important. The raised funds are not the goal, they are the tools to achieve your idea and turn your idea into a real service or product. After a successful ICO, you have the tools to make things happen. Hire people, innovate, test, and advertise. Use the raised funds to get things done.\n\n10. Release as fast as you can \nDon\u2019t forget, you promised a service or product to your investors who helped you make it a success. They are waiting for you. Don\u2019t let them down, release your product and make everyone happy.\n\nContact:\ninfo@listico.io\nhttps://www.listico.io\nhttps://www.listico.io/ico-listing.php\nhttps://www.listico.io/youtuber-sources.php",

The project is ruled by the experienced team that created **DAEMON TOOLS** app.\n\nThe platform wants to get rid of the uncertainties which a lot of the smaller investors are facing. This is going to happen thanks to the constructing of a secured and trusted loan-based investment portfolio which is going to deliver predictable, competitive, and, most importantly, consistent returns.\n\n**About the project**\n\nThe first thing to consider is what the value proposition is. Now, Token Lend offers three different things. These include:\n\n* ***Loan Portfolio***\n\nThe platform is going to be released with an already included and pre-arranged list of loans which are secured by trusted EU loan originators. It is going to boast a secure, user-friendly and easy-to-use interface.\n\n* ***Entirely Decentralized Architecture***\n\nThe business logic behind the platform is to take advantage of the benefits which are brought forward by the blockchain technology. Using the capabilities of Ethereum, the project is going to deliver a fully functional and comprehensive platform with an array of capabilities and different opportunities.\n\n* ***Secondary Market***\n\nToken Lend is going to bring a convenient secondary market which is represented by the native token of the platform. This is something which users are going to be able to trade on the open exchange where it would be listed in order to gain access to an instantly liquid asset.\n\nThe platform attempts to provide substantial and consistent yields to its investors as well as real estate secured loans to its consumers. The interest rate shall vary between 10% and 14%. Furthermore, the borrower is also open to accept funds from any other source which is available at an interest rate of 5% to 8%. This is something to consider.\n\n**About the ICO and the Token**\n\nThe pre-sale started on the 1st of March 2018, will run for 11 days and will be capped at 3 500 ETH with a minimum contribution of 1 ETH.\n\nContributors purchase TLN tokens at the base rate of 2500 TLN per ETH during the official sale. The platform has designated both a bonus scheme and a bounty program to incentivize investors. The platform upon which the entire project is built is the one of Ethereum and the token is ERC20 compliant.\n\nThe sale will begin on the 26th of March 2018.\nThe contribution period will run for 45 days.\nDuring the ICO, there will be soft cap of 5 000 ETH and a hard cap of 41 000 ETH.\nAll unsold tokens will be burned.\nTLN tokens received by contributors will be transferable 7 days after the end of Initial Coin Offering campaign.\n\nThe country from where the project comes is Belize. There is a KYC and the USA is a restricted area, which is quite unfortunate. The minimum investment during the pre-sale is set to 1 ETH. There is no minimum investment for the official token sale.\n\nWebsite - https://tokenlend.io/\n\nWhitapaper - https://tokenlend.io/tokenlend_whitepaper.pdf",

            "text": "First venture capital firms were founded in 1946 after WW II. They encouraged and helped soldiers that returned form WWII to start their own businesses and at the same time gave birth to the venture capital movement. The VC movement gave us many great enterprises, for instance, such companies as Google, Facebook, Youtube - true unicorns which made a great impact on our everyday life. 71 year after the beginning of the VC era we can witness a revolution in the VC field - ICOs and, especially, ethereum based ICOs. Indeed, year 2017 is the beginning of a new investment (and even entrepreneurship) paradigm.\n\nSo, what do I mean? It is well-known, that the VC investing has lots of barriers for ordinary people, in others words for most of us. \nThese are such barriers as:\n\n- legal (special requirements for entities involved in VC, the field is overregulated);\n\n- financial (smb with USD 300 cannot just simply get into VC);\n\n- bureaucracy (even with all requirements fulfilled and funds you have to do tons of paper work);\n\n- etc.\n\nIn general, barriers to entry in VC are tremendous.\n\nVice versa, investing through ICOs has no barriers. No special requirements, you only need to get some eth through exchange (registration at exchanges is a pain but if to compare with requirements for VC its a piece of cake), transfer it to your own wallet and comply with requirements of the certain ICO (usually ICO requirements are friendly). So, you just need a bank account, internet, money and some patience in order to get onto the exchange registration, cryptowallets and ICO requirements. And you do not need special knowledge in IT, finances or VC. In 2017 VC which was available only for very rich minority became mass adopted in the form of ICO.\n\nThe ICO concept is very young. As it is stated at the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering) page the first token sale was held by Mastercoin in July 2013. However, in 2017 you already have the possibility to invest in startups in such fields as tech, biotech, finance, AI, real estate etc. And what is the most important is that when you give money (in eth, btc etc) you have the possibility to change the world due to the reason that innovations change the world. And most startups which make ICO create innovations. Maybe there is a startup or there will be a startup which is funded by us through ICO and that will become next Google or Tesla. And you will be also the part of a great impact which this startup will have.\n\nThis means that we, ICO investors, bear social responsiblity even if we give 300 dollars. And when we choose startups for investments we need to think not only about our gains but also on how this startup which we are going to invest in can improve prosperity of the whole society. Or environment. Or both.\n\nThat is why, ICO is a simple but powerful tool. And when you look for startups that are making ICO you must make a thorough research. And sort out priorities in a right way. Sometimes it is more important to invest in a small startup that will never make x10 but can change the world than to invest in a startup that has huge profitability but will never change the world.",

However, I do hope it will help some people out and I also can learn something from the neo community.\n\nSwicheo is a decentralized exchange (DEX) on NEO platform.\n- Well, we all like DEXs bacause they are like ...decentralized: no need for trust on single institution or individual (no sudden shutdown like Chinese's exchanges), anonymous to a certain extent (no personal documents to apply), reduce certain attacts compare to central server (imfamous Mt.Gox). That are some of the core value of cryptocurrencies.\n- Neo platform, it is on the raise, one of the greatest platforms, some claims that it is even better than the almighty Ethereum on certain aspects. The host for smart contract and Dapps of the future certainly can not be just 1 or 2 platforms, it would be a tree of chains, but NEO is sure a big branch, at least for a while.\n- \"May expand to other cross-chain tokens in the future\", QRE20 of QTUM seems to be under developmant and ERC20 of Ethereum is planned on Q3 2018. I think that is their ace in the whole.\n=> Great!!\n\n\"Switcheo manages the entire trading experience on-chain, giving you the experience of a centralized exchange with the security of a decentralized exchange\". I don't quite understand it here since there are not much info about the project. The white paper will be releashed soon, they said. But I do not expect much from the part of \"the experience of a centralized exchange\". DEXs are sure not easy to use (especially beginners), they have only basis features. On-chain matching engine is also a problem since at the moment, whatever done on-chain, is not optimized for performance. Liquidity is also a problem, but they are well aware of that.\n=> surely questionable for the bold claims: \"the experience of a centralized exchange\" but we have to wait and see. If it is true (not likely) then great!\n\nToken are SWH, and tokens utility is more or less like Binance, we \"may use SWH tokens for a discount on trading fees based on current USD value of the SWH Token over the past 23 hours on our Exchange Platform\". \"SWH will also be used as a base on all trading pairs and is the primary means for cross-chain transfers\". So in short, Switcheo is a decentralized Binance. Another advantage is that we do not need to wait for the tokens to be listed. As long as their are people who have the unlocked tokens and willing to trade, they are all available. Only problem of Switcheo model is that the fee is not fix 0.0% - 0.5% on both sides depending on market conditions. Trading fee makes DEXs less attractive but SWH is to solve it.\n=> the model of tokens utility is great, it is proven by Binance. The fact that exchange fee depends on market, could really boost the the adoption of SWH. Therefore, great!\n\nCompetitors: all the exchanges in general, but biggest one is sure NEX and even IDEX and Etherdelta in the near future. NEX is sure the big guy and seems to have technical superiority. But the Switcheo team is well aware of that so they focus on the user experience and their ace in the whole is \"aims to be cross-chain compatible as quickly as possible\". There are sure space for more than one DEX for sure. Even the crappy Etherdelta are useful to some extents, Switcheo are very likely to better.\n=> not sure, let's see.\n\nWhat do you think?

It\u2019s big, bright, and it\u2019s fair. At least that\u2019s what we think. It\u2019s called an internet of value, and it\u2019s on the shores of every country. \n\nWhen we envisioned Harbour, we saw the Ethereum blockchain as the ocean upon which we could build our fully decentralized organization. We have designed a DAO that we think fulfils the complete promise of the blockchain. This is done by providing a framework that is autonomous in every aspect, allowing full self-governance by the token holders. We believe that Harbour is an innovative way to comprehensively participate in the growth of blockchain technologies and solutions in general, which will all be tokenized. \n\nUnlike any other token in the ecosystem today, Harbour allows complete democratic control through its DAO. The Congress voting system allows all Harbour token holders to have a say in the direction of Harbour\u2019s (soon to be) vast resources, and further, allows all Harbour token holders the opportunity to collectively guide its decisions. Think of Harbour as a massive symbiotic brain on top of the ecosystem that is optimized and incented toward overall value. \n\nI hope you\u2019re as excited as we are, do check out our one pager on: https://harbour.tokenate.io/ and if you\u2019re interested on getting more information in the future you can sign up for our mailing list",

The aim of ETHLend is to provide a transparent and global lending market and to erase interest rate differences between countries by providing more liquidity to local lending markets. ETHLend solves key issues regarding to collaterals, decentralized credit rating and exchange volatility risks, which enables the concept of decentralized lending experience.\n\nThe team behind ETHLend consists of 20 people who share the same aim to deliver decentralized lending to everyone. ETHLend differs from most blockchain startups by the fact that the team introduced their alpha release in early May this year. Based on the practical findings, ETHLend provided a detailed White Paper on how decentralized lending might revolutionize the lending industry permanently.\n\nWhile ETHLend is continuing to develop the decentralized application further, the team also revealed details on the upcoming pre token sale. ETHLend introduces LEND token for contributors who are participating in the token sale. The main utility function of LEND is the ability to use it for paying deployment fees on ETHLend with a 25% discount compared to ETH. Additionally, ETHLend shall provide other privileges for LEND token holders based on the community suggestions once the DAPP has grown into a full scale lending market.\n\nMore info at:\n\nhttps://about.ethlend.io/token-sale/\n",

The blockchain will ultimately provide the scale and ability to verify this.\n\n* The future plan is for an open source interface to be built as part of Gems to help similar ideas prosper powered by the innovation of the blockchain\n\n* The GEM token, a multi-utility token, fuels the Gems Protocol. Gems uses its token mechanism to enforce the behavior of all participants\n\n* Gems allows DApps creating significant future value to allow anyone to build on top of the Gems Platform\n\n* The first module the Gems team will build focuses on labeling data for AI. AI itself incorporates machine learning and deep learning. AI as an industry is a multi billion dollar industry growing rapidly\n\n**GEMS Value Proposition**\n\n* Removing middleman thus fees\n\n* Ensuring and maintaining accuracy of the service (microtask)\n\n* Building out an open sourced future proof platform which can be used for parallel opportunities in the micro task space\n\n* Removing centralised payment services such as Banks\n\n* Creating transparency and fairness in prices for performing microtasks\n\n**ICO Strengths**\n\n* Innovative idea (Current market inefficient \u2013 Whitepaper explains this through simply micro-economics)\n\n* Educated management team (Harvard University). U.S based sibling team co-founders\n\n* Strong social media presence (Telegram: 30k+ members)\n\n* Contemporary branding which is easy to recognise\n\n* Clearly presented whitepaper\n\n* Alpha product existing \n\n* Clear roadmap \n\n**ICO Weaknesses**\n\n* Young management team (Similar to a lot of coins out there)\n\n* Limited experience in the sector\n\nNote: This is not intended to be investment advice.

But these are my reservations: 10 trillion tokens is a lot. 1 trillion in the crowdsale, the remaining 9 trillion to the 'KIN Foundation' and KIK - definitely don't like that split. I wouldnt touch Gnosis cause of a similar split. $125M is a lot to ask for in a crowdsale, in my opinion. I know there are others who've taken more, but I dont particularly like them either. I think you should take what you need, no more. And the less you ask for, the more room there is for growth for investors too. Furthermore, there has been speculation that this ICO is to raise money to pay off early investors in KIK rather than to pay for the KIN project. For example you can see some quotes from the CEO: \"It\u2019s a way to raise funding and a way to get money into the company,\u201d he said about the ICO. And \"He believes that the ICO will provide an adequate return for the existing investors, which would take pressure off a possible acquisition or an IPO.\" [Source](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/kik-ceo-claims-an-ico-is-better-than-venture-fundraising/). Those quotes are a bit worrisome to me - seems like he wants money more for KIK than for the actual KIN project. Overall, I am suspicious that this is a revenue-starved social platform trying to pivot to become profitable by capitalizing on the recent ICO fervor. But like I said, doesnt mean it wont pump anyways, lol. Ill probably pass tho.",

The investor will be able to buy shares in a single high-value diamond, or in a basket of diamonds, or invest in individual stones.\n\nThe CEDEX platform, called the DEX rates and segments diamonds into investment categories. It enables the investor to view data on the gemological composition of the diamonds and invest online, simply and securely.\n\n**The DEX and Blockchain Technology**\n\nAt the core of CEDEX is the DEX, a proprietary machine-learning algorithm designed to overcome the diamond industry\u2019s biggest challenges\u200a\u2014\u200alack of transparency, lack of liquidity and lack of standardization\u200a\u2014\u200awhile classifying diamonds into a specific asset class.\n\nThe DEX will connect diamond holders who want to liquidate their assets with traders looking to hedge or diversify their investments into diamonds.

After all, even the best traders are not immune from any changes in the cryptocurrency market.**\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we say about ordinary newcomers who have just entered the crypto-currency market and are in no way immune to the sudden shifts of the altcoins. That is why the team of specialists created its BITRUST platform to provide an opportunity to ensure its assets and potentially reduce losses in the event of a sudden and sudden change in the market. All this is possible through the use of smart contracts that will contain all information about the terms of the contract, ensure security and the implementation of the agreement. And also to carry out transparent and reliable transactions without the participation of third parties.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nIn 2017, 179 new altcoins were released, many of which fell dramatically. It is for this reason that BITRUST offers investors to use their platform to avoid such pitfalls and significantly reduce the risks that are often associated with high market volatility. Experts BITRUST believe that the use of this platform will reduce barriers to entry of new investors. And also to increase the amount invested by current participants of the crypto-currency market and for one to increase the liquidity of the altcoins.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n**BITRUST** is a decentralized insurance platform with a simple and affordable P2P, ETH-based, smart contract. The main objective of the project is to have an accessible interaction between the retail trade of crypto-currencies and investors with an average monthly volume of trades from 100 to 100 000 US dollars.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nAt the current time, of course, various solutions are beginning to appear that are aimed at risk management for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Nevertheless, they are more focused on more experienced traders (various hedge funds and trading houses). This, in turn, makes them very expensive and difficult for beginners of crypto-currency investors.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nAfter all, often, the problem faced by a potentially new investor is associated just with an increased risk of losing the value of particular altcoins. And all because there is currently no transparent regulatory oversight and the main form of investor protection. Therefore, the cost of altcoins is not set by anyone, not counting the market and its participants, who are engaged in trading on exchanges.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n**BITRUST** also offers its potential users a crypto-currency insurance platform, through which investors can bypass and significantly reduce their costs and risks for investment management. BITRUST hopes to bring a special social contribution to the development of the block-community, which will increase the attractiveness of the crypto-currency market as a whole.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n* [LEARN MORE HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2R0RW4nvsQ)\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nA recent study by the British firm Autonomous NEXT has about 68 crypto hedge funds, which are actively involved in the development of the crypto-currency market. Basically, they use the traditional investment strategy in ICO. Nevertheless, although specialists have recorded a significant growth of these crypto hedge funds, they are still at the initial stage of their development, in comparison with traditional hedge funds.\n\n\n---\n\n\n \nThough with every day the market is developing and developing, it is still just beginning. And a person who wants to delve into this ultra-dynamic market, there are difficulties, because it is difficult to predict any fluctuations in the market. On the basis of this problem, the idea of \u200b\u200bits solution arose, by creating the BITRUST platform.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n**The BITRUST** team is firmly convinced that crypto-currencies have a number of advantages over Fiat. At the same time, they look at the current state of the market from several sides, namely: the capitalization of the crypto-currency market, the types of wallets used, the number of participants, the problems associated with exchange and security, and the presence of large players.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nThe platform itself is officially registered by BTF Project Limited, which plans to launch its launch no later than January 2019, if it will certainly raise enough money after a token.\n\n\n---\n\n\n \n*I think the idea of this project is very necessary for investors because I myself am an investor. In the future, I will enjoy using this platform with the help of which I could save myself from losses and risks associated with a sharp drawdown of altcoins*\n\n\n---\n\n\n \n> **Therefore, if you are a beginner or a practicing crypto-investor, I recommend that you familiarize yourself with this project in more detail:**\n\n* [BITRUST](https://bitrust.co.uk/)\n* [FACEBOOK](https://www.facebook.com/BITRUST-150162739077561/)\n* [TWITTER](https://twitter.com/BTF_PROJECT) \n* [WHITEPAPER](https://bitrust.co.uk/files/whitepaper.pdf) \n* [BOUNTY](https://bountyhive.io/join/Bitrust) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n@BTF_PROJECT #BTF_PROJECT",

However, I tend to be pretty good at reading strategies.\n\nIt will be a social payment system first. They'll announce that you can send money to your friends and businesses using cryptocurrency for a small fee (rather venmo-esque). Then they will introduce the Facebook token with reduced fees. The real play here is the gift card play, many will never be used, and even for ones that are used Facebook gets the money earlier.\n\nAt the same time they will expand the offerings available. The p2p sales area will move to facecoin first, the advertising buy will be facecoin, social games will transparently (for a fee for the game but invisible to you) be able to accept facecoin.\n\nThis is really about trapping money inside Facebook where they can invest it and keep the rewards.\n\nDon't get too excited, it will not benefit you",

According to a rough estimate, around 25 million people on the Globe have so far enjoyed the beauty of digital currencies or tokens (based on open data for the top ten most liquid crypto coins). A bottleneck is, among other hard places, in limited ability of average people to transfer money from one form to the other. There are several existing solutions in the market, all of which lack either reliability, or simplicity, or sufficient speed and liquidity. The project we are about to introduce, Coinplace, aims to resolve all of these issues. We are launching this official account of Coinplace to provide the public with all up-to date news on our development and specifically to discuss our crowdfunding which is about to begin. Jump on board and follow us for more news, research and professional opinions, and share your feedback with us.\n\n________________________________________\n\nIn the article below we present Coinplace working platform. \nWe speak of its features and discuss possible benefits for users, \nas well as ways to join Coinplace ICO with maximum financial effect.\n\n\n________________________________________\n\n**What is CoinPlace?**\n\nCoinPlace is a multicurrency P2P marketplace. \nHere you can buy and sell any cryptocurrencies, coins and tokens for fiat money. \nYou can register your ICO on Coinplace in a blink and trade digital assets from any point on the Globe.\n\n**Problems that we solved:** crypto exchanges limit traders and enforce their internal conditions and timing. \nCoinplace will free holders of crypto assets from all limitations that crypto exchanges impose.\n\n**Why:** besides the traditional wiring system to assist crypto and token buy and sell, we offer our \nclients to set up private announcement boards where only you will decide what to sell, whom to deal with.\n\n\n________________________________________\n\n\n**Who benefits from CoinPlace?**\n\n**Investors:** they are buying cryptocurrencies fast and easy for real money and can pay with banking card,\n PayPal or whatever way they want, getting much faster transactions than on crypto exchanges in return. \n\n**ICO initiators:** they will register the project in days and can start selling tokens before the listing is paid,\n unlike classical exchanges where listing is long and expensive.\n\n**Newbies:** no need of initial registration on exchanges. Can buy tokens and cryptocurrency directly from sellers via CoinPlace. \nPay them in fiat money the way they are accustomed to.\n\n\n**Token holders:** those who have already invested in multiple tokens from different ICOs and currently got lost in exchanges. \nCoinPlace will bring all their assets together, with no need to jump between accounts, sites and apps.\n\nCoinPlace platform is already running, however to step the business up, we need to strengthen our influence on the cryptomarket ecosystem,\n and this requires more resources. We need to build up our products, expand into new markets and hire expert employees to develop our business \u2013 and those are tasks we will be pursuing. Funds to be raised via ICO will speed up growth of the platform.\n\n________________________________________\n\n**Coinplace ICO Details**\n**Pre-ICO Stage:** November 15\u2014 December 31, 2017\nSize of the bonus depends on amount of tokens bought \n\n**Bonus**\n\n1 000 000 - 50%\n\n1 000 000 \u2014 2 000 000 - 45%\n\n2 000 000 \u2014 3 000 000 - 40% \n\n\n**Main ICO:** February 2018 (TBD)\nThe earlier you kick in, the bigger bonus you get\n\n**Time frames and bonus in tokens** \n\nFirst 12 hours of the ICO - 25%\n\nNovember 16 \u2014 18 - 20%\n\nNovember 19 \u2014 21 - 15%\n\nNovember 22 \u2014 24 - 10%\n\nNovember 25 \u2014 26 - 5%\n\nNovember 27 till 24:00 - 0%\n\n*Accepted means of pay:* ETH, BTC and fiat money.\nETH, BTC \u2014 via CoinPlace.info.\n\n*Total issue:* 100 mln CPL tokens.\n\n*Price:* 1 CPL = 0.001 ETH\n\n*CoinPlace aim is:* to let the broad audience to step in and to help ICO adherents develop.\nAt some stage, cryptocurrencies will become an easy to understand and popular\n and entering crypto world will be of no difficulty at all.

With CryptoLadder you can actually watch as coins move up and down the ladder in real-time. In addition to price and rank, it also calculates and adjusts market share, market cap, and global market cap all on the fly and in real-time. The whole point is to give everyday traders quick and easy access to real-time information so that they can make better decisions. My hope is that tools like this will empower the average person and level the playing field from the really big dogs out there. It seems to me like that's what this sub (and Crypto) is all about.

So where do digital currencies go to die? This company thinks they can be reanimated and gain a second life.\n\nCoinJanitor, a project by Marc Kenigsberg, wants to recycle these coins and create new value with them. The idea is to buy out Zombie coin holders, giving them a way to recover some of the investment they lost in these dead coins. Once the buy outs are complete, CoinJanitor will own all the assets that belong to that coin, so it can create new tools using the data, code and other relevant assets. This is not the first time we have heard about someone pursuing a project like this but it may be the first time a company has been created with a plan to \"clean up dead coins.\"CoinJanitor says it will start buying the dead coin projects, looking at their code, the data within their blockchains, their other assets and perhaps come up with plan to produce tools and services by recycling. Shouldn't there be a few diamonds in the rough from the thousands of stumbling crypto projects? Out of the 4500 or so DOA crypto, CoinJanitor plans on targeting non exchange traded cryptos with less than $50,000 in value.CoinJanitor says that anyone may get involved with the project. They have launched a rewards program to help it spread the word and get started with the buy out process. CoinJanitor is in the process of launching their own initial coin offering \\(ICO\\) to help fund the concept. Their sale is ongoing and scheduled to end on May 31st \\($7.5M hard cap\\).",

TerraGreen is intended to break down the walls between energy producers, investors, utilities and consumers so that people get involved and influence how their energy is produced.\nTerraGreen Motivation\nEnvironmental stress to earth has induced an urgent quest for innovation in the energy structure on a global scale. TerraGreen is all about bringing reform in the existing energy supply structure and transition to a new energy system through the use of Blockchain Technology, that can fundamentally reduce GHG emissions and mitigate waste pollution. TerraGreen is an ecosystem, where renewable energies are tokenized and can be used by the community in exchange for fiat currency or payment for energy consumed. But we are not stopping here, we want to use the blockchain technology in a way that users can monitor how the energy is produced and what it is used for.",

This blog piece will go a bit into Token Economic Theories, how previous projects have failed to understand and make use of the most powerful aspects of any Token based Ecosystem.\n\nCryptocurrencies grow in value based on **Metcalfe\u2019s** **law**, which states \u201c*the effect of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n*\u00b2*).\u201d*\n\nPut simply, **the more users a network has the exponentially more valuable it will be.** That means users are the most important aspect of any network. Traditional ICOs were extremely good at bootstrapping your network effect, by giving everybody a little bit of share of the network. Everybody is incentivized to spread the network to others, having 100 people spreading awareness to others is 100 times better than having one VCs assistance of 10 people (100\u00b2).\n\n### The Problem with ICOs so\u00a0far\n\nHowever, for the past 3 years, this system became more and more corrupt. We want to take things back to how they were in the early days. Raising funds is not just about money, at least it should not be. Getting tokens into the hands of the right community is the biggest benefit of any ICO. Communities consist of government officials, developers, business owners, enterprise employees, (social) media influencers, and everything a project needs to become a long term success.\n\nMany token holders will be speculators, which is fine. We all are happy to make money, but a projects responsibility is to acquire as much talented and influential token holders as possible, and convert speculators into active community members.\n\n***The value of cryptocurrencies is defined by nothing more than censorship resistance, game theory, and token holders. In the long term, these three factors will be decisive determining which coin will have the highest market cap.***\n\nUp until now, the only way to get tokens into the hands of the right people were exchanges. As a result, the exchange became immensely powerful. With social mining, projects finally have a better alternative to get tokens to the community. By using APIs and community boards, social media channels, chat rooms, Github and blockchain integrations, it\u2019s possible to evaluate a score for every member within the community and pay them individual salaries for continued support in tech, marketing, and business development.\n\n***Social Mining is a concept that helps engage new users, by using all types of social platforms, such as GitHub, Telegram, Twitter, Discord, LinkedIn and many more and leveraging token economic theories to incentives and create an organic community of skilled long term holders.***\n\nThe system **will eventually take** into account a lot of factors such as:\n\n* The number of tokens held by a user\n* The time that the user has been holding tokens\n* Engagement on social media channels, like Telegram, Reddit, twitter etc\n* Reputation within the community and ecosystem.\n* Active involvement in the community departments for tech, marketing, and business.\n* Open source development, running nodes, community management.\n\nThe outcome should be that the community evolves into a self-governed Decentralized Organisation. The result of such a system is that higher level members will be more knowledgeable, more loyal, but will also be holding a higher amount of tokens. Higher ranked users will earn more benefits and responsibility, but also have a higher stake. They are disincentivized to cause problems but incentivized to make use of user influence and reputation to help the project, hence growing token value.\n\nWe lay the base to which we can build a global ecosystem, and you guys can help us from ground 0. By earning reputation, roles, responsibilities community members can help can earn monthly rewards and also users donations.\n\n### How to get\u00a0started?\n\nFor now, all you need to do is [register](https://community.elrond.com/) on our community, connect your social media accounts, share articles and news or start helping our developer team by connecting your Github account. **Your rewards and reputation will be directly proportional to your efforts.**\n\nFor the short term we\u2019ve got 3 phases prepared for you: **awareness, educational** and **development**. Right now, it\u2019s important to have the community very close to us and engage people on all existing platforms.\n\nCome join us, and be part of this awesome journey.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFull article in:  [https://medium.com/elrondnetwork/help-build-the-elrond-ecosystem-and-be-rewarded-ca0ef30f4283](https://medium.com/elrondnetwork/help-build-the-elrond-ecosystem-and-be-rewarded-ca0ef30f4283) ",

            "text": "A primary advantage of blockchain integration is that it opens the travel market to the crypto space with tokenized value transfer. The Gozo platform including wallet, loyalty reward points clearinghouse, and PLUS membership club, is a one of a kind solution and early mover in the industry. Not only does Gozo\u2019s proposed \r\nplatform surpass the capabilities of current online travel booking providers in terms of discount opportunities, but its tokenized loyalty reward platform and the loyalty reward points to crypto token conversion system is a competitive advantage that cannot be matched by online or legacy travel services. Tokenizing travel rewards and the associated functions that allow exchanging, tracking, controlling and transferring them, leads to Gozo\u2019s main value-added features.\n\n#Example Of Use Cases for Gozo Platform and Token#\r\nLet's take a look at the use cases for Gozo platform token; \n\nUniversal Wallet: Wallet Holders can: \r\n Hold Tokens, cryptocurrencies and travel loyalty reward points in a cryptographically  secure app. \r\n Send Tokens to other blockchain wallet addresses for payment. Wallet holders can send \r\n GOZO tokens, ETH, BTC, LTC, XLM, and 100+ other cryptocurrencies and tokens.\r\n Receive Tokens, GOZO or any of the 100+ other major tokens and cryptocurrencies in their \r\n wallet. Wallet holders will receive from any other blockchain wallet, exchange, \u001fat conversion, \r\n or as loyalty reward or member rebates from the Gozo platform. \r\n Earn Tokens for participating in certain activities like referring new members, social media \r\n promotions and similar Gozo positive activities. Gozo PLUS Wallet holders can earn GOZO \r\n tokens, automatically as a member, in the form of monthly rebates, and/or when booking \r\n wholesale through the Gozo PLUS wholesale booking engine.\r\n Exchange Points for Tokens or vice versa. This feature allows users to convert travel loyalty \r\n rewards into GOZO tokens, and then into any other supported cryptocurrency, token or \u001fat \r\n currency if so desired. \r\n A\u001bliate Rebate - Wallet holders can continue to book on Booking.com, Expedia, Priceline, \r\n and other travel portals, and earn GOZO tokens in the form of a\u001bliate rebates. This applies \r\n to members and non-members.\r\n\n#Loyalty Reward Points Management and Clearinghouse#\r\n\nGozo wallet holders will benefitt by consolidating all their points into a single wallet. This will allow \r\nnon-crypto holders to directly and easily acquire crypto tokens and currencies.\r\n\n List and Manage Loyalty Reward Points from Various Providers Instead of having to keep track of multiple loyalty reward accounts with airlines, hotels, rental car agencies and the like, the Gozo wallet and platform allow users to keep all this important data in one convenient app. Once a user begins working with the Gozo Wallet, their loyalty reward points will be easily tracked and managed.\r\n\nWhen a user can easily see all their accumulated travel loyalty rewards from various sources in one convenient app, new opportunities avail themselves. They will be able to consolidate and realize value of their loyalty reward points accumulated across disparate channels. Suddenly, users can see when they have \r\nenough points saved for a free \u001eight, free hotel stay or even a free cruise. They may even choose to convert their points to GOZO tokens, exchange them for other cryptocurrency/tokens, or apply their GOZO tokens for Gozo PLUS membership and/or travel purchases at wholesale prices.\nVisit our website for more information:https://www.gozo.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/gozo.io\n\n\nBountyox Username: Confiance0665",

The main goal of the Wolfcoin blockchain is to facilitate fast and secure transactions with a governance that helps sustain the network for the benefit of all users. The Wolfcoin blockchain is a two-tier network comprised of a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism powered by miners and a Proof of Service (PoSe) system powered by masternodes. Miners receive rewards for ensuring the security of the blockchain and masternodes are rewarded for facilitating the features of the network including Private Send and Instant Send. Wolfcoin uses the X11 hashing algorithm and is based on the Dash Core codebase version 0.12.3.3.\n\nThe Wolfcoin blockchain is secured through Proof of Work (PoW) in which miners attempt to solve difficult problems with specialized computers. When a problem is solved, the miner receives the right to add a new block to the blockchain. If the problem was solved correctly, the miner is rewarded once the block is added. The second tier, which is powered by masternodes, enables Wolfcoin to facilitate private and instant transactions with Private Send and Instant Send. Masternodes are also rewarded when miners discover new blocks.\n\nThe block reward is distributed with 80% going to the masternodes and 20% going to miners. The masternode system is referred to as Proof of Service (PoSe), since the masternodes provide crucial services that support the features of the network. Masternodes also oversee the network and have the power to reject improperly formed blocks from miners. If a miner tried to take the entire block reward for themselves, the masternode network would orphan the block ensuring that it would not be added to the blockchain.\n\nIn short, miners power the first tier, which is the basic sending and receiving of funds and prevention of double spending. Masternodes power the second tier, which provide the added features that make Wolfcoin different from other cryptocurrencies. Masternodes do not mine, and mining computers cannot serve as masternodes. Additionally, each masternode is \u201csecured\u201d by 10,000 WOLF. Those WOLF remain under the sole control of their owner at all times. The funds are not locked in any way; however, if enough of the funds are moved or spent to cause the user\u2019s holdings to drop below 10,000 Wolfcoin, the associated masternode will go offline and stop receiving rewards.\n\nBy pre-ordering your WolfpackBOT subscription, you will also receive Wolfcoin as a reward that can be utilized in the following ways:\n\nRedeemable for WolfpackBOT subscriptions\nRedeemable for the WolfBOX Console\nRedeemable for WolfpackBOT and Wolfcoin apparel and merchandise\nFungible utility that can be exchanged for like value on exchanges\nWhen you hold at least 10,000 Wolfcoin in your Wolfcoin wallet connected to a static IP address, you will become a masternode, meaning you will have a chance to receive 80 percent of the block reward every sixty seconds.\n\nhttps://www.wolfpackbot.com\n\nBounty0x Username: Olowookorun",

            "text": "\"Catex\" (Cat Exchange) is a mining transaction exchange and \"Catt\" is the token of this exchange.In the last couple of years, because of extreme power consumption of the systems that are used to mine cryptocurrencies, and the decrease of price in all cryptocurrencies, mining costs has exremely increased and the environmental impact of this power consumption has begun to discuss by people. As the result of these, the stream of trading mining has begun to used in newly established exchanges. Trading mining is a new term in cryptocurrency world that means mining is being done by the investors while they are trading any coin listed in the exchange. Thats to say, when the investors buy or sell any coin in the market, the token of the exchange is being produced at the same time and depositted to the investors account in return of paid fee. Catex gives 5% mining bonus to all of its investors to make mining more attractive. In other words, paid fees return to investors as Catt 5% more. [https://www.catex.io](https://www.catex.io)",

They have created a space which is ripe with creativity in this sector and where all the players are very happy to work\n\nSecondly Malta will be one of the first counties in the world to have regulation in place on virtual assets, utility tokens and Distributed Ledger technology (DLT Ie blockchain). This comes into effect 1st October, and it only means good things for for everyone in the crypto ico sphere as it will weed out the cowboys and shady icos.\n\nThirdly Malta is an EU country and allows companies based in Malta to easily work in the Eurozone, Ie Malta regulation = Being regulated In Europe - so you should have no stumbling blocks with other Eu countries.\n\nBeyond all this the life in Malta is fantastic. Listed as the 7th best place for an expat to live, due to its high standards of living, 300 days of sunshine, amazing beaches, 24 days of annual leave plus 14 public holidays (that\u2019s more then a month off every year), low crime rate and relatively decent cost of living, people quickly get hooked to this little Mediterranean gem\n\nWhat\u2019s more is the Maltese government is always looking at incentivizing investment on the island with various tax schemes which will benefit companies moving operations to malta.\n\nWith all this Malta is set to be the blockchain/crypto equivalent of Silicon Valley!\n\nWhat do you think? Will you consider setting up your operations on this tiny island?\n\nFull disclaimer: I am a Maltese dual citizen, and have lived on the island for the last 20 odd years, having founded (and still own) a number of successful business in Tech, entertainment and tourism, and I myself am running an ICO from Malta - launching its pre-sale 15th September.\n\n[Source: another top 5 crypto exchange moves to Malta ](https://www.ccn.com/another-top-5-cryptocurrency-exchange-plots-move-to-maltas-blockchain-island/)\n",

Which of course means that in reality no one other than the owner and his 2 other accounts has ever watched it. \u0422here are of course a lot more evidence described one by one and the point is that  basically we are talking about complete frauds with no real media influence and are literally **stealing the money of the ICOs.**\n\nOne of the discussed YouTubers has been made **114 or so paid Youtube \u201cReviews\u201d within a time frame of a 1 month**.\u00a0 which means that the **owner has made about** **$170k** **for that period and he has scammed most of the bigger ICOs at the moment, to pay him for a \u201creview\u201d of their project in front of his** ***bought & fake*** **followers and viewers.**\n\nThese findings lead to several complications such as - **how competent are the teams that conduct public token sales  collecting millions of ordinary people's money if they can't spot that a guy that have 114 reviews in one month** can NOT do it in a legitimate way and have a worthy following along with that. Or at least check some of his videos, how hard could that be? Money management issues? Nah mate, we'll get enough for till the end of the world, right.\n\nAnother bothering thing is that you are paying a person to intentionally lie to people, since the Youtubers discussed never disclose they are being paid and in every video they are claiming that this is their honest opinion. And to be honest the \"reviews\" are shit, just like a very big number of the projects they promote, **so ICOs like UBEX are not only wasting their money but they are doing it only to hurt their reputation as a result.**\n\nNow, in the **Ubex** case, when asked about this, guess what they do? **They ban you from their Telegram group.** ([Here's one such case](https://new.reddit.com/r/CryptocurrencyICO/comments/96b4wj/ubex_scam_banning_people_from_tg_asking/)) **It doesn't matter that you have no fault for their mistakes or that you might be a large investor in their project and just want to know what's their answer for that kind of stuff. Nope. They just ban you.**\n\nNow 3 days after the article went public nothing's changed. These Youtubers are still running their profitable business of scamming ICOs and lying to the few occasional real viewers that run across their channels. The biggest scammer has made **4 new \"reviews\" yesterday**, how fucked up is that? :D\n\nListen gang, **if we as a community don't fight stuff like that and make it public, then the crypto ecosystem will be a filled with shit stories like these for a long time.** Please report the youtubers and spread the word about the corrupted methods that the ICOs are trying to use (and getting scammed by as a result) to promote their stuff.\n\nDamn.",

For more people to use it, dissemination has to happen. For dissemination to happen, people have to understand the blockchain and cryptocurrency.At this final step, of making the blockchain and crypto easy to understand, stands a great blockchain solutions provider by the name of iOlite. Their dedication to bringing more people to the blockchain echoes our own and that is why we are grateful to announce our partnership with them!iOlite is a blockchain solutions provider with a trainable language-translator built on the blockchain. What this means is that their platform enables you to program in any language, including English.So, let\u2019s say that you want to write a smart contract, but are not that technically gifted, which is perfectly fine. The blockchain can be a pretty complicated place. Well, their platform allows you to program in the language that you are most comfortable with, whether it\u2019s a programming language, Python or C++ for example, or a spoken language. Once you are done writing the smart contract, you have the ability to translate the document into the desired output code or language.Another feature of their platform is that once you are complete, you have both the source code of the input language as well as the signed source code of the output. This concept is original, as most of the time when you code, you only have the selected language you coded in, and not a plain text version of it as well. This aids many newcomers and also adds the ability to have some sort of legal standing with your smart contract because you will have the spoken language source code and your written code can be verified with that.",

We are frustrated by the current batch of exchanges: at one end of the spectrum built on complicated forex engines designed for traders, and at the other end of the spectrum far too basic and with very limited altcoins on offer.\n\nBuilding trusted and simple software is what we do, it's what we've always done.  You don't get to work with companies like J.P. Morgan Chase, Royal Bank of Canada, BAE Systems and Gemalto for the combined decades that our team have unless you have something special to offer, or without learning a bunch of really useful stuff along the way.\n\nWe know that we can create the world's most trusted and simple cryptocurrency exchange.

Its platform allows people from all over the world to invest their cryptocurrency into real world assets across three types of funds \u2014 Real Estate Funds (REFs), Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), and Crypto Funds (CFs) \u2014 without first exchanging into fiat currency.\n\nAlong with CTFs, and CMFs (together known as Coin Managed Funds) Brickblock also facilitates investment in traditional assets like ETFs and Real Estate Funds.\nThere are many advantages of providing access to traditional asset classes like ETFs and Real Estate Funds via cryptocurrencies. Brickblock will enable investors to mitigate the volatility of cryptocurrencies via diversification into traditional assets without the hassles of fiat conversion. Investments in traditional assets via cryptocurrencies also has other benefits like lower associated costs, quick settlement and most importantly no geographical restrictions.\n\nThe working of the project revolves around the concept of Proof Of Asset. Investors send ether to smart contracts after selecting the fund they want to invest in. After the broker/dealer receives confirmation of the funds,he purchases the assets and sends the shares in a trust fund. Investors receive Proof Of Asset tokens in return.\n\nBrickblock legally ties its Proof-of-Asset (PoA) Tokens to real-world assets like real estate, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and crypto indices. Owning a PoA token means you have real ownership of the underlying assets. Every asset is represented by its own PoA Token.\n\nCryptocurrency based fund management along with traditional assets makes sense. The core intention of investing in funds is to diversify the risk. Connecting cryptocurrencies and traditional assets involves a lot of legal hassles. Brickblock itself will use 15% of the funds raised in the ICO for creating legal structures, with legal teams present in many countries. Going ahead the success of this project depends on how the team navigates through regulations and whether cryptocurrency holders will find value in diversifying in traditional assets.\n",

It features the sale of 130,000,000 COSS Tokens at the rate of 600 COSS per ETH. COSS token itself has been marketed as a revenue-generating currency that enables holders to receive revenues in the form of transaction fees charged by COSS system.\n\nAs per the company\u2019s bylaws, the COSS token holders receive weekly revenues to their wallets. The team plans to add more revenue streams to ensure higher returns for its backers \u2014 the people who participate in the COSS Token Swap round. There is evidently a scope for such changes, for the platform plans to roll out versatile services as its development goes ahead. They include a secure e-wallet, an exchange, market rankings, a merchant list, a payment gateway and point-of-sale (POS) system, a digital marketplace, cryptocurrency/token listing, proof of development and other functions.\n\nFor a moment, people had doubted COSS platform for being another run-of-the-mill startup luring investors with attractive returns. But as one dwells, s/he can find a well-known and experienced team backing it. What\u2019s further impressive is the range of expert advisors COSS has, including professionals from business, IT, banking, finance, technology, and \u2014 indeed \u2014 cryptocurrency.\n\nMore, the COSS team has ensured to keep the funds generated by the Token Swap round with an escrow, meaning the proceeds will be allocated as per a predefined framework. This escrow will have three signatories, meaning the funds will be stored in a multi-signature wallet. \n\nGrab some for yourself before it list on exchange. \n\nBy Yashu Gola\n",

Therefore, we decided to categorize top cryptocurrencies by industry/field they operate in.\nCategories file with 300+ crypto map is [here](https://matchcoins.info/300-crypto-map-matchcoins-info.pdf).\n\n\n**Observations**\n\nAfter going through 300+ coins\u2019 websites, reviews and sometimes even whitepapers, one by one, we\u2019ve noticed a few issues:\n\n* There\u2019s a lot of projects but only a small number of them solve real-world problems. There are so many similar projects without any use cases, or potential real users.\n* Most coins aim to solve the same problems and focus on the same broad use cases.\n* A large number of projects claim to be \"better, faster, bigger, etc.\" yet fail to provide any sustainable competitive advantage\n* With a few exceptions, the vast majority of blockchain platforms (Smart contracts and dApps) don't offer clear significant benefits against the established players. In addition, they don\u2019t provide services that would help attract new users, e.g. helping them integrate users\u2019 products into the platform, and they don\u2019t suggest any other ways of how they will attract a critical number of users. This will likely result in a large number of zombie platforms serving small numbers of companies.\n* Similarly, only top3, maybe top5 projects within each category should dominate, while the rest would struggle to attract users or cease to exist, unless they pivot to focus on specific small niches within their markets\n* Many projects fail to clearly communicate what they actually do and why they exist, i.e. what are their benefits against competition. In some cases, we needed to really go deep into their whitepapers or even discussion boards to understand what they actually do.\n* In cases when a project aims to solve a specific problem, it seems to have much lower market cap potential compared to crypto projects that are impossible to link to traditional companies or industries\n* Top 3 categories of the reviewed projects: Finance (29%), Digital cash (21%), Smart contracts and dApps (16%)\n\n\n\n\n**Categories** ([check the 300+ crypto map](https://matchcoins.info/300-crypto-map-matchcoins-info.pdf))\n\nCategories are available on MatchCoins.info, currently as a feature of coin comparison. In addition, we\u2019ve assembled all the top projects into a Crypto Map for you to see the big picture here. Enjoy!  If you have any suggestions, we\u2019d appreciate your feedback.\n\n\n\n\n**MatchCoins.info tool**\n\nMatchCoins.info is a cryptocurrency comparison and research tool. Use it to:\n 1. Estimate the potential of a coin by adjusted market cap and total/circulating supply\n 2. Check coin\u2019s major competitors and how they compare in relevant categories\n \n\n\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe coins have been categorized based on our own research and opinions.

There are many applications and customers have to run from one application to another to be able to operate their funds. First customers must find sites/applications for those operations and register each of them. And they have to be sure that those sites are trustable or not. Customers must spend so many time to buy, to sell, to exchange, to invest, to trade and many other operations. That is why the result is always dissatisfaction and displeasure. It explains that digital world needs more user-friendly products and services. COSS platform came forward for this purpose. To create a single ecosystem for mass adoption among not only experienced customers but also people new to cryptoworld.\nCrypto-One-Stop-Solution (COSS) is a platform that combines the most popular cryptocurrency services and products of digital ecosystem at the same portal such as managing transactions, exchanging, integrating merchants\u2019 payments, controling their funds and so many more . To this end, the COSS platform is planned to have its own wallet and own wallet. An exchange, a merchant platform and many more related with crypto are also part of the platform.\nLucky when I was join it with nice bonus! And now only 5 days till the end of ICO. You still have chain to take at good price I thought\nYou can read more info in there WhitePaper\nWhitepaper : https://coss.io/documents/coss-whitepaper-v3.pdf\nhttps://coss.io/",

COSS aims to offer multiple cryptocurrency-related services in one place. It consists of a payment gateway, an exchange, a merchant list, market cap rankings, a marketplace, an e-wallet, various coin facilities, and a mobile platform.\n\nThe two revenue sources of COSS are from cryptocurrency exchange and payment gateway. In terms of fees, they are comparable to the existing exchanges / payment solution providers.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Here are the details of the COSS TOKEN ICO in brief:**\n\nSTART DATE: 8TH AUGUST 2017.\n\nEND DATE: 6TH SEPTEMBER 2017.\n\nName of TOKEN ISSUED: COSS TOKEN.\n\nTOTAL TOKEN SUPPLY: 200 MILLION COSS TOKENS.\n\nTOKEN PRICING: 600 COSS TOKENS= 1 ETH.\n\n\n\n\n**There are a variety of reasons that would attract an investor to COSS.**\n\nFirstly, there is an already set up company with a fully functioning business that is serving merchants and individual customers, with an ever growing user base.\n\nSecondly, by owning and holding COSS TOKENS, investors will be eligible to earn 50% of the weekly transaction fees/earnings off of the COSS PLATFORM that will be paid to them on a weekly basis!\n\nThirdly, as more products and services are rolled out and added to the COSS PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE, earnings will increase.\n\nMore reasons to consider investing in COSS TOKEN would include the fact that COSS TOKEN will find a use from day one, which gives it even more intrinsic value, unlike other tokens that start off purely as vapor ware. You will be able to find out in more detail the trajectory and roadmap plans for COSS in the COSS WHITEPAPER in order to fulfill your curiosity and complete your due diligence with ease. It\u2019s such a simple process to purchase COSS TOKENS and you can do it directly on the COSS website itself. The earlier you invest, the more bonus tokens you can accrue also as the early bird catches those extra worms.\n\n**Opportunities**\n\nThe project has been in development since last year and it already has a working product.\nBoth segments of the project, cryptocurrency exchange and payment processing, are large and growing quickly. If COSS succeeds in becoming one of the leaders in either space, token values should appreciate substantially.\nThe utility of token is straightforward \u2013 the more transaction fees COSS generates, the more valuable tokens are.\n\n**Concerns**\n\n\nCOSS will have a difficult time reaching the hard cap of 216,667 ETH, given the relatively lack of awareness and current market environment.\n",

Unfortunately from them, still no alpha version, no listing on the exchange. Does it make sense to wait? I'm already beginning to think that EXCUDO Scam, although the founder is not hiding and constantly news are) anyway i trying forget excudo and find another, so now active two ICO campaigns that are busy solving this problem and that I was interested in, the first is BelugaPay, and the second is Savedroid. BelugaPay in the market has long been providing services and have a large client network. will Launch on exchangers at February 14, 2018. Visa Licenses and a master card they already have. I have no desire to describe the whole concept, as they have quite clear the video is on YouTube. https://youtu.be/aJqY7qMa3Ng The main thing that I stressed for myself is the fact of a large team, the current business, testing is already underway. accreditation from visa. will soon appear on the exchanger and will issue cards. From the perspective, I like the connection of small and medium-sized businesses to their networks, so we can finally get away from the banking system. The downside is that USA  Canada and Singapore citizens are not allowed to participate in the ICO. However, the same disadvantage probably Savedroid, apparently do not want to contact the legal side in these countries.SaveDroid has German roots and about 200,000 customers, that is, they have a great chance of development in Europe. they have been working since 2015, about 18 employees, but reviews about the company are not flattering, but what is interesting is that they have almost sold out all tokens, do not want to miss this opportunity and do not participate.on Reddit them not yet, but BelugaPay can be read here https://www.reddit.com/r/BelugaPay/ I have been investing in ICO for a long time and usually always ask the advice and opinion of experienced people. Of course BelugaPay? What would you recommend?",

As a cryptocurrencies and online betting/gambling enthusiast, I recently bumped into an interesting project that combines both of them: [AstorGame](https://astorgame.com) . I did some research and I think it has potential, but I am curios to know what everybody else thinks about. Here are my findings so far:\n\n* huge and diverse target market: eSports, sports betting, online casino and lottery. I basically invested in every decent project I found that attempts to disrupt these industries, because there are big chances that at least some will go big.\n* improves existing, centralized platforms by combining provably fair technology with smart contracts. As a result, users can be sure the games are fair and have their funds secured inside smart contracts. So, no matter what happens, users are in control of their money and no entity can interfere. From my experience as a player, this is the most important feature that AstorGame will bring to the industry.\n* realistic and detailed roadmap for the next 2 years, with clear milestones and objectives;\n* the team consists mostly of developers and I find this very important. Unfortunately, most projects doing ICOs are all about CEO, CTO, CFO, COO, CSO, marketing specialists, community managers and so on, which is nice and everything, but is going to build the product? I prefer developer-focused projects.\n* using Astor tokens within the platform is not required, but it provides discounts and other benefits (similar to how using Binance does not require BNB tokens, but you get a discount if using them)\n* 40% bonus for one more week;  \n\n\tPlease let me know your opinion on this project. I would like to get into the first bonus period, unless some critical flaw is brought to light.\n\tThanks and good luck to everyone!",

Which leads me to think, what else did they prepare for? Underwhelming demand? Why not prepare for this?\n\nI'm upset at the lack of accountability shown by these companies who have now made more money in a short amount of time than they made in their entire existence. You would think these companies would have the funds needed to be able to meet this \"overwhelming demand\" or whatever is causing the delays.\n\nSo once these companies have collected tens of millions of dollars and then announce delays or unexpected issues, I'm now of the belief that that Ico will absolutely fail. \n\nReason being, good leadership knows how to use their money to solve problems. You can't tell me an Ico made $30 million dollars and then now has a problem that they need 2 months to fix, but all the while continues to offer pre-sale discounts to people in exclusive 24-hour sales windows. \n\nAgain, successful leadership knows how to use their money to fix issues and stay on track.\n\nIf I'm way off base, please tell me. What accountability do you see these companies holding themselves to? What protection do we have as investors? \n\nThis is the number one flaw with blockchain technology. Once funds are received, the receiving party now has no one to answer to and no one who can reverse a payment. And they know that.\n\nInvest cautiously and definitely run the Ico by a few people before sending them a penny. In my estimation 19 out of 20 ico's are complete frauds that have no intention of ever hitting an exchange.\n\nPost a link to the ico's you're invested in right now that you are concerned might be fraudulent and I'll compile the data, do some research and share what I find.\n\nI'm on a mission here. \n\n",

We've had some challenges operating ... opsec takes its toll ... and have slipped schedules.\n\nBUT we will not ICO until we have a working service with live transactions. At this point we have enough money to continue development for a while but not enough that it would be worthwhile to exit scam. I think that this gives our investors confidence. Even if we take longer to launch than we hoped, we are not going anywhere ... we are in this for the long-run.\n\nI think more ICOs should give out equity. Their stupid tokens are probably securities anyway so make it official. And they should do a small seed/round-A/pre-ICO funding phase, then use that to build and sell more equity later. It is better for early investors as they will get more % for their $. And it keeps the pressure on the team. Raising $1-5M seems like a lot, but it is not enough to run away for good especially if there are multiple people involved. It is not enough to run a high growth company for years. But it is more than enough to build and launch and get rolling.\n\nI hope more ICOs take our approach and deliver real businesses before taking serious money. Their fuckups will hurt the whole market.",

The hearing saw U.S. lawmakers strike both supportive and critical tones on cryptocurrencies - for example, one member remarked that they constitute \"a huge topic that cannot possibly be scratched even in five minutes\", while another member called them a \"crock\". Many of the questions focused on the regulatory parameters applicable to cryptocurrencies that are in place in the U.S. today, such as securities laws. Ultimately, many subcommittee members expressed a commitment to strike a balance between oversight and the accommodation of blockchain technological innovation. (Source: Coindesk)",

The crock comment came from the lady who also referred to crypto currencies funding terrorist organisations and sex trafficking, during the hearing which is equally applicable to any Fiat currency too. There were also few who were extremely positive about the potential of crypto currencies. As rightly mentioned in the post, they agenda is to strike a balance between regulation and self regulation, without hindering the innovation.  ",

At the end of the day, do your due diligence and go with your gut feeling. The link above is an interview between Ian Ballina (a popular youtuber in the crypto space that provides information on ICO's) and the founders of Arcblock: Robert Mao; and Flavien Charlon. When this project first caught my attention, I was really bullish on it as a prospect for the future of the blockchain. The concept of creating a third generation platform/ecosystem for building and deploying decentralised blockchain applications is an innovative step for the evolution of cryptocurrencies as a whole. With that said, after watching this interview I am not so convinced that the team can deliver the goods when push comes to shove.\n\nI am aware there have been other posts out there that have questioned the integrity of this project- with particular reference to the size of the development team and exaggerated partnerships with IBM. When asked by Ballina what the status of the team was, Robert Mao seemed to beat around the bush and not answer in a succinct manner. Surely, as a CEO of a major start up, you should have the logistical break down of your team members on the top of your head. Furthermore, the whole vibe I got from this interview seemed to suggest that they are not very professional at discussing their own product, which makes me skeptical about the marketing potential of this team to capture the attention of the crypto community.\n\nMoreover, I did not like that they included media links with the likes of Bloomberg or Techcrunch without having any links to these so called articles. Mao's response was vague and seemed to imply that the articles were in press and about to be published. Why would you prematurely post that on your website before the launch, if they were not even available for the public to view? Just seems disingenuous to me. Finally, his track record with 2 start up companies in China do not give me investor confidence. While I do not discount his technical experience at Microsoft, I do question his ability to run a smooth business. For me, I was let down by this AMA with Ian Ballina and therefore treating this project with caution. I love the concept, but concept is different to working product!\ufeff",

It is also something that should not still be unresolved a day or two before the ICO. \n\n6) The stuff about partnerships was very evasive and can basically be ignored - they effectively just applied to join a couple of subject-matter work groups much like I might join Lego Ideas !\n\n7) The answer about the PR stuff was pathetic - anybody with even half a brain - with PR experience or not - would know you cannot refer to or quote from any articles or interviews by the Press that have not actually been published yet !It was also interesting that the CEO claimed they would actually be published in the next few days or week -i.e. before the ICO (which might strengthen the investment case) or after the ICO (i.e. after they have the ICO money). Something to look out for !\n\n\nI\u2019m genuinely not sure if they are a scam (and will take the money and run), or just bumbling amateurs (who will struggle to deliver) - I tend towards the latter - but either way I\u2019ll not be investing.

            "text": "The world of today is developing incredibly fast. The variety of new technologies and processes have advanced in different regions of the world on a regular basis. They\u2019re from different fields and industries and serve unique purposes. However, innovations have one thing in common - all of them need safety of personal information and program code. If this requirement is violated, no company would be able to survive.\n\nCyber Security Market Advancements\nThe role of cyber security market has become extremely important under these circumstances. It\u2019s played a role of the most crucial industry and works as infrastructure for all other businesses. In turn, the internal development of the market has never been more expected. Everyone knows the proverb - \u201cNew Times Call for New Measures.\u201d\nMeet Hacken - the first platform and cryptocurrency of the same name, which is custom-tailored to satisfy the needs of the cyber security market. The main characteristics of it are decentralization, liquidity, and anonymity thanks to the application of the best suited technology for these purposes - blockchain.\nWithin the offered functions, this technology would assist the company in coping with all the challenges of the industry. It would help achieve the highest level of security for a startup and assist the white hat hackers in their desire to work in an ethical key by providing high compensation and total anonymity for them. The cyber security market would obviously benefit from the application of blockchain technology, especially accounting for the fact that the cryptocurrency would be created taking into consideration all the peculiarities and needs of the market.\n\nHacken Influence on the Market\nThe creation of Hacken framed a priority goal for the company and industry in general. The company aims to contribute to the development of the cyber-security market and promote the idea of being a white hat hacker. To ensure the achievement of this noble goal, the company designed some products, which are integrated within the Hacken ecosystem.\n\nHacken Proof\nThe first component to assure the implementation of the cyber security market changes and improvements is the Hacken Proof platform. It will offer white hat hackers a range of projects so that they\u2019ll be able to participate in vulnerability and penetration testing of various companies. The competitive advantage of this bug bounty platform would be total anonymity. Neither customers nor clients would be able to reach each other or harm in any means. All the operations on the platform would be delivered in exchange for HKNs only, which would help frame the industry and its future growth. More information about the policies and participation prospects are available via this link https://hacken.io.\n\nHacken Accelerator\nHowever, the single company would not be able to frame and achieve all the goals, stated above. That\u2019s the main reason why Hacken is willing to create another product, the Hacken Accelerator. This would be the place where the best initiatives in the cyber security field are to be supported by Hacken and its marketing team. The first participants would be announced during the Annual HackIT conference, which would be assessed below. It\u2019s also noteworthy that all the operations and funds of the Hacken Accelerator would also be in HKNs. As a result, young and bright talent will be able to bring their ideas to fruition regardless of any stiff competition and a lack of funds.\n\nHackIT Conference\nThe support of the market by searching for and preparing the best professionals of cybersecurity is also a top priority for Hacken, which would help frame the industry and its further development. That\u2019s why the company is supporting the biggest cybersecurity conference in Eastern Europe. During late September, teams from all around the world would compete in the CTF event, sponsored and supported by Hacken. Additionally, the best hackers will be hired by Hacken while their ideas would gain support and investments from within the Hacken Accelerator.\n\nDoes the Community Really Need It?\nThe question of the necessity of Hacken\u2019s existence in the industry is being debated by a plethora of people. The company sees its goal and is willing to transfer it onto others. It\u2019s promoting the idea of ethical hacking and making the world more secure in terms of use of the Internet. Hacken supports the values of protecting businesses from hack attacks and getting bounties for this. The usage of blockchain technology would make it easier for the industry to achieve this objective. In turn, anonymity would help white hat hackers do their work and remain safe.\n\nHowever, the Hacken company is not only useful for the community. Accounting for the constant trend of growth in the industry, it\u2019s obvious that investing in the Cyber Security market would also be beneficial. The use of blockchain technology makes it far easier for Hacken to find possible investors. An ICO of the company enables other people to vote with their capital and support the market by investing in HKNs. The presale of them has already started. The main sale will last until the end of November. The initial exchange rate with fiat money is 1 HKN=1 USD. More information can be found in the Whitepaper of Hacken.\n\nIn turn, IT companies and other forms using IT products for their operations would also get advantages from being part of the Hacken ecosystem as clients. They would be able to acquire access to the extremely high amount of white hat hackers, whose task is to provide premium quality penetration and vulnerabilities testing. The competitive advantage of Hacken for clients is that a number of participants of the testing would be random and adequately high. All of them would remain anonymous and unaware of all the other participants of the testing process. In addition, all bugs identified will become the property of the customer. Thus, it will be protected by Hacken policy. All these facts will ensure the highest results and safety for the client.\n\nIn general, the cyber security industry is currently facing constant changes and challenges . Hacken offers a viable framework and tools which would be helpful in remaining competitive and safe in this ever changing environment. The company offers a new point of view on cybersecurity and white hat hacking. It\u2019s aimed at supporting the other projects in the sphere to achieve its goal \u2013 making the world a safer and better place.\n\n[Source link](https://steemit.com/tokensale/@hacken/new-ico-project-for-white-hat-hackers-penetration-testing-and-vulnerability-research-have-never-been-so-easy)",

Following the success and profitability of the farm, now Ambit Mining provides an opportunity for mining enthusiasts to become part of the mining family and further expand the existing, profitable mining operation to reach up to 20 MW capacity. Instead of offering the investment opportunity to the few large investors, Ambit Mining ICO allows the individuals interested in cryptocurrency mining to enter the mining operation and share the profits of the future operation.

            "text": "**PILLAR PROJECT**\n___\nFor those who want the details, please read the [**Pillar Gray Paper**](https://pillarproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/PillarProjectGrayPaper.pdf). Here is a short version:\n___\nThe European Commission\u2019s [*Fire Study of Next Generation Internet*](https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/the-fire-study-ngi-white-paper-survey-results_01.pdf) recently concluded that ...\n___\n- **Internet should ensure citizens' sovereignty over their own data and protect privacy;**\n\n- **Internet should ensure diversity, pluralism and a right to choose; and**\n\n- **Internet should avoid the concentration of data in a few proprietary platforms.**\n\n- **Personal Data Spaces was seen as a very important technology area for all the above top ranked values.**\n___\nThese are the problems the Pillar project will address. We want to give people a better, safer dashboard to their digital world, starting with an open-source wallet. We have two main objectives:\n___\n**Replace accounts with atomic ownership**. We all have dozens of accounts. With accounts, you log in and all your valuable data is trapped inside the app or the service. This presents huge concentration risk. By switching from accounts to wallets, each person owns his/her own assets and can switch vendors freely.\n___\n**Replace apps with services**. Apps on our phones are miniature desktop apps. This harkens back to the days of paper-based processes, showing once again that humans always adopt the old ways of working to new technology. Now that we all have superconnected computers in our pockets, we believe the personal data locker will replace iOS and Android to become the operating system for all your devices.\n___\nThe decentralization movement and technologies like blockchain will lead to a fundamental reversal of power, putting people in control of their digital lives.\n___\n\n**The Pillar Wallet**\n___\nHaving waited patiently for 15 years, we believe the moment is here now. We will start by building the world\u2019s best cryptocurrency and token wallet. We will focus on the user experience - to make it as easy as possible to set up and use a wallet. There are a few excellent wallets - we have our work cut out for us. But since our target is to build a dashboard for your digital life, our wallet will be different. Our wallet will be mobile first. It will include a browser, and we hope to include one or more exchanges. We want the experience to be as easy as possible. We\u2019ll be targeting specific use cases and personas and working to make their experience as familiar and powerful as possible. Almost everyone is a beginner. Almost everyone finds managing private keys challenging. Almost everyone doesn\u2019t appreciate the complexity behind wallets and exchanges and smart contracts. This is our mission - to simplify, build a strong foundation, and keep adding what our customers want next.\n___\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl2aNk72TUc\n___\n**The Pillar Ecosystem**\n___\nPillar is far more than a wallet, a browser, and an exchange. Pillar brings to life the concepts in David Siegel\u2019s book, *Pull*. As David explains, apps are a huge waste of resources and prevent innovation. Apps have to be maintained on half a dozen platforms - more than 50% of every app is just infrastructure related to presenting content and offers. What really matters are content, connections, and commerce, and being able to mix them as you like. The Pillar wallet will let you sort, filter, compare, mix, and match these things to suit your needs. This represents the convergence of the semantic web and the web of value.\n\nAs an example, think of attending a conference in a city far away. To do this on your phone you\u2019ll need a dozen apps that don\u2019t talk to each other, and you\u2019ll sign contracts for air, rail, car, hotel, tours, shows, excursions, currency exchange, babysitting, restaurants, conference registration, scheduling, events, meetings, and more. At best, each of these has its own app, and probably its own reward point system. Now try to manage all the expenses and record keeping - more apps. Do the apps talk to each other? In general, they don\u2019t.\n\nThe pillar ecosystem will create a new ecosystem of data, content, and commerce. We\u2019re almost there - we have the standards, formats, and APIs to do much of what we want. It\u2019s our job to bring these together to create a customer experience that is many times more compelling than using apps. In general, you\u2019ll ask a question or say what you\u2019re looking for, and the content, data, and transactions will come to you. We believe the wallet will be the center of your digital life, and it will pull everything you want when you want it, in a way that's more natural than apps.\n___\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj24xaXei3Q\n___\n**The Personal Data Locker**\n___\nThe concept of [the personal data locker](https://medium.com/@pullnews/lets-crowdfix-the-data-problem-permanently-4acfe2c833a9) comes from David's book, *Pull*. We have seen many such projects come and go. Much of it comes down to trust - people don\u2019t trust institutions, advertisers, or third parties to manage their data. This is why Microsoft and Google projects have failed.\n\nWe understand that consumers don\u2019t want to manage their own data. There\u2019s a detailed section of the gray paper that goes into consumer reluctance and how to find our early adopters. Right now, we have a chance - to create the world\u2019s best wallet, integrate it into many systems, and let it lead to the personal assistant that \u201cmagically\u201d helps you manage your life. See this early video from 2010 that shows the use cases for the project: \n___\nhttps://vimeo.com/14061238\n___\n**The Pillar Token**\n___\nWhile the wallet and platform are open-source and free, users will pay for the various PDL services with pillar tokens as they use them. The token will power (provide micropayments for) the entire ecosystem, giving an instant business model to many projects that can tie in. This is the beauty of the token: you may need a service exactly once and you won\u2019t need to sign up for it, you\u2019ll just pay for it with a Pillar token and you\u2019re done.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: you go see your doctor, she does some tests and gives you a prescription for some pills. All the data from that visit, and the prescription, will be copied to your wallet. You can then manage the prescription any way you like, including asking for bids from pharmacies for the lowest price, or fastest delivery, etc. In this case, pharmacies compete for your order, and their software can be aware what the bid/ask is, and they may give you special offers to choose their service or even pay you to watch an ad for a particular drug. This is all under your control - you decide how you want it, and you pay a small number of pillars each time you use the system for storing your records and letting you manage your relationship with the health-care system. Your data can even go to a study being done - with your permission - and even though you\u2019re anonymous in the study, if they want to send you a message, you\u2019ll have a choice of receiving it or not.\n\nThe pillar is a meta-token. For example, Brave has a native token for seeing customized ads and monetizing your browsing experience. Augur has a token for betting. Akasha has one for messaging. You'll encounter dozens or hundreds of tokens as you go about your day. All these tokens will be native in our system one level below the Pillar token. Users may only ever see pillars, or they may see the various utility tokens for the services they use.\n___\n\nThe Pillar token sale starts on July 15th at 08:00 Greenwich Mean Time and ends 60 hours later on July 17th at 20:00 GMT. Of the 800 million tokens issued, 560 million  will be for sale to the public. The price in ether will be the same throughout the sale and will be announced on July 14th.\n\nOur Token sale smart contract is available on both Ropsten and Kovan testnets. The address of the contract is:\n Ropsten - 0xc1a6c4f19ad01e96111acf66ca8f1b6b47fecd6e\n Kovan - 0x571a6216e9ddb3f4979851d4e9f58454750ad721\n\nOur GitHub link is:\n\nhttps://github.com/twentythirty/PillarToken/blob/master/contracts/PillarToken.sol\n___\n**The Pillarists**\n*You are welcome to join and contribute what you do best!*\n___\nhttp://pillarproject.io/about/\n___\n\n**David Siegel, founder (Switzerland).** David built a web-design and strategy agency in San Francisco in the 1990s and sold it to KPMG.

We will have tracks for central services, communications, product, and marketing. If you are reading this, you are welcome to join us (we're not paying expenses, sorry, but we are paying for the meeting rooms and a big dinner on Friday night).\n___\nWe will have the following tracks for discussion and hiring:\n___\n- **Product**\n        1. Frameworks\n        2. Methodology\n        3. Languages\n        4. Tools\n        5. Open source\n\n- **Marketing**\n        1. Communications\n        2. Partnerships\n        3. OEMs\n        4. Consumer research\n\n- **Central services**\n        1. Key management\n        2. Asset management\n        3. Bookkeeping\n        4. Payroll\n        5. Accounting\n        6. Tax\n        7. Facilities\n        8. Events\n        9. Support\n        10. Legal\n___\nWe are looking for **generalists** who have certain strong skills and are flexible team players. We will never have an HR department - if you work in central services, you will do everything. Keep in mind our office will be in London. If you want to join us, please come to Poprad and show your commitment to the project!\n\nThe event will take place from 29 July to 6 August. Direct flights from London are available. We have reserved 19 rooms, but they are going fast and people are finding roommates. There are also hotel rooms not far away. We\u2019ll be working in the mornings and trying not to work in the afternoons. It\u2019s a family event - bring your kids. To reserve your room, contact Tomer@2030.io. Don\u2019t wait for our Token sale - rooms are going fast. Contact Tomer now to get one.\n\n___\n[Website](https://pillarproject.io/) | [Telegram Chat] (https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAENziLEX7qqQ7DP7-w) | [Telegram News](http://pillarproject.io/join-us/t.me/pillarproject) | [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PillarProject/)\n___\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/PillarWallet) | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/twentythirty2030/) | [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.9520;sort=first_post) | [Blog](https://medium.com/@pullnews) | \n___\n[Github](https://github.com/twentythirty/PillarToken) | [Steemit](https://steemit.com/@mm319) | [Blockgeeks](https://blockgeeks.com/author/2030ag/)",

All you have to do is sign up for an account and join telegram group.\n\nThis is not huge earning at the moment, but holding on to them could get you some crypto in the near future.

My research has led me to a couple of projects that stand out from the rest. \n\nEnjin Coin www.enjincoin.io\n\nMindsports www.mindsports.io\n\nDmarket www.dmarket.io\n\nAll of these seem to have pretty solid teams and pretty good ideas.\n\nThere is a ton of money in social games, so a solid platform for monetization with cryptocurrency seems brilliant.\n\nMindSports.IO should do pretty well with the variety of games it offers. The intellectual gaming community really could use a platform to play all these game in one place. Also, incentivizing user-generated content would be a great way to build the community up.\n\nDmarket fills a desperately needed hole in the virtual property space. Gamers spend huge amounts of money buying virtual game items. This takes a lot of the risks and hassles out of that process and opens up opportunities for a lot of gamers who just can't participate right now.\n\nAnyway its just a quick overview of my research, and I'd love to hear thoughts from others on this. I'd love to identify a few of the best projects in the online gaming industry to invest in.",

To be frank, the majority of Enjin's \"market base\" is kiddos that need a free gaming forum.\n\nWAX, although it has OPskins, the arguably the most successful CS:GO markets with billions of dollars of revenue, its ICO is simply a very huge risk. Why? The ICO only sells about 7.4% of the total market cap. There is a very low chance of high returns compared to Refereum or maybe even Enjin.\n\nSo in terms of investment, WAX and Enjin might be simular in terms of both pro's and con's, refereum should be one of the ICOs that should be looked into.",

At best, any move by the firm to lead the new wave of data protection is audacious, but other revelations indicate there may be more sinister motivations in keeping with their recent notoriety.\n\n**Backing gangsters and perverting the philosophy behind crypto**\n\nThe Times claim to have received documents that show Cambridge Analytica\u2019s efforts to promote Dragon Coin, a digital currency that has twice failed to deliver an app allowing investors to use its virtual coin and has been associated with famous Macau gangster, Wan Kuok-Koi.\n\nReports by the newspaper suggest that Cambridge Analytica had been discussing potential ways of using cryptocurrency to influence political campaigns. According to Jill Carson (a consultant experienced with working alongside blockchain companies), Cambridge Analytica employees bragged about how their tactics had helped get President Trump elected with their successful targeted advertising campaigns on social media. One strategy involved sending crypto to people in Mexico in return for filling out surveys. The idea was that the data gathered would allow the firm to design campaigns for Mexican political candidates.\n\nThe reported behavior of Cambridge Analytica suggests its goals run counter to the ideals with which DLT was designed. The evident desire to manipulate data to influence political decisions is a complete perversion of the idea of democratic technology and any ICO backed by the firm would likely struggle to garner much support from the crypto community. However, given the secretive nature of their foray into the world of crypto, the community would do well to examine ICOs offering data protection closely.\n\n",

If anyone is interested in joining, please email me at Kesseb362@outlook.com\n\nHey, guys, I need your help :) Lately, there has been a lot of irrational exuberance towards ICO's in the cryptocurrency world. My intention is to try to weed out the best of the best, through extensive research and examination. By looking deeply at the motives and the people behind the coin, I believe we can reduce the risk of investment in such speculative endeavors substantially. The problem is, I can't do this alone. It's simply too time-consuming to look into every single ICO in depth. With that said I was wondering if any of you guys would be interested in forming an ICO Team/Squad dedicated to finding such information. Now, of course, many of you are very bearish when it comes to ICO's... This, of course, is understandable given the risks, but perhaps even you could gain something from this. In fact, I would be happy if such skeptics joined the team as it would give us a clearer outlook on which ICO's have the highest probability of success. I'd also like to note that I'm, new to Reddit... but given the sense of community, I found an ideal place to post this. Thanks :)",

            "text": "Maybe you\u2019ve heard the term \u2018smart contracts\u2019 mentioned in cryptocurrency circles, but you\u2019re unsure what the term means. Perhaps you\u2019ve even heard how smart contracts have the potential to disrupt traditional lending institutions like banks, but you find it hard to grasp how this will happen.\n\nTo fully understand the smart contract concept, we need to take a step back. So first, let\u2019s define what a contract is.\n\nA contract is binding agreement between two (or more) parties and which is enforceable by law. The contract also describes the terms and conditions each party agrees agrees to fulfill under its terms. For a traditional legal contract, the agreement is usually in written form (with all the accompanying paperwork) and also involves a requiring a third party (usually a lawyer) to witness the contract to make it legally binding.\n\nNow, imagine a contract carried out with without paperwork or the need for any third party involvement. That is exactly what a smart contract is.\n\nSmart contracts are automatically carried out without the need for third party involvement, because they digitally verifies the terms of contracts have been met. In other words\n\na smart contract is a computerized transaction protocol with a job is to execute terms of a contract. Smart contracts utilize blockchain technology, where a massive computerized ledger system keeps track of transactions which cannot be changed once entered.\n\nHow Smart Contracts Work\nSmart contracts have the potential to revolutionize many industries and the financial industry tops that list. In particular, smart contracts make it easy for investors and startups to engage in P2P (peer-to-peer) lending, eliminating the need for third parties.\n\nHere is an example of a typical P2P crowdfunding process between investors and startups:\n\n1. Money comes from investors and is stored in a database no one has access to\n\n2. When a sufficient number of investors are satisfied with the progress of the startup, the smart contract is triggered to release the investors\u2019 funds\n\n3. If the borrowers fail meet progress milestones, funds go back to the investors\n\nThe process above occurs without either party incurring typical lending fees, because every aspect of the contract is done electronically and automatically, without any need to involve banks or other third parties.\n\nSmart Contracts and the Lending Industry\nSmart contract will significantly reduce the need to use traditional lending institutions, or have contracts drawn up by lawyers in the near future. These are but a few of the massive benefits of smart contracts to shake up the existing lending industry.\n\u2022 No transaction fees incurred by the borrower\n\n\u2022 No third party involvement needed to borrow directly from investors\n\n\u2022 The potential for financial fraud is reduced, as borrowers must meet certain, verifiable conditions before their funding is released\n\n\u2022 Smart contracts provide data that enables easy tracking and auditing of funds\n\n\u2022 Smart contracts provide the ability to borrow from anyone located anywhere in the world without any fuss.\n\n\u2022 Paperwork is reduced or eliminated via smart contract technology\n\nIf you think smart contracts are far away in the future, think again. Cutting edge fintech startups are already incorporating smart contracts in their business models.\n\nA Crowdfunding Startup Already Making Use of Smart Contracts\nCrowdCoinage is a company at the forefront of fintech technology. This startup incorporates smart contracts directly into their crowdfunding platform for ICO projects.\n\nHere is how their crowdfunding process for ICO projects works on CrowdCoinage.\n\nThe CrowdCoinage community votes on whether or not to accept a project. Once a project is accepted for funding, the startup must reach specific milestones before funds are released. Once investors are satisfied these milestones have been met, funds are released to the startup automatically via smart contract.\n\nAs the startup achieves other milestones in the future, additional funds are released via smart contract as well. Thus, there is no need for third-party involvement, or any loan processing fees generated in the lending process.\n\nAs well, investors and startups all over the world can participate in peer-to-peer crowdfunding on CrowdCoinage, as they are not limited by location or jurisdiction.\n\nLooking at smart contracts as a whole, the benefits offered to investors and startup alike are mind-blowing. From security to accountability, decentralization, and a significant reduction in fees, you can be sure smart contracts are the next big deal in lending.\n\nStartups like CrowdCoinage are leading this lending revolution.\n\nFor more information about CrowdCoinage, please visit: www.crowdcoinage.com. Their own token ICO is running now until March 12, 2018.",

Where should you invest to make sure you won\u2019t get left holding the baby? Where are the shitcoins and where is the digital gold? These questions, among others, torment millions of people worldwide on a daily basis. Fortunately, the knowledge level of crypto enthusiasts is slowly growing. Whoever isn\u2019t too lazy to do some reading and look for the right info can have +100k scam defence stats. But even then, it\u2019s hard to take everything into account. Fraudsters come up with new schemes all the time and you need to be extremely careful if you want to keep hold of your money.\n\nScam hunters are divided into two groups \u2013 those who think that celebrity involvement in a startup is a red flag and those who, on the contrary, see it as a sign of credibility. We decided to find out who has the truth on their side.\n\n## Red Flag\n\nSteven Seagal is at a loose end. Other people are saving ships and planes these days, his Russian passport has only brought him advertising work in that country and not even his craziest fans watch the latest films he\u2019s starred in. Still, his 7 kids need to be fed somehow, so the actor agreed to join the Bitcoiin project. The name alone tells us it\u2019s a fucking scam aimed at idiots (just imagine you\u2019re launching a sportswear brand. You wouldn\u2019t call it Nice, would you?). Take a look at the website and [road map](https://bitcoiin.com/en/roadmap), then tell us: what raises 100 million dollars in investment and still produces absolutely nothing? Hint: it\u2019s a 4-letter word that starts with \u201cs\u201d and ends in \u201cm\u201d. Seagal himself has already washed his hands of it, just like the rest of the team.\n\nFloyd Mayweather Jr. must be the greediest black guy in history. He earns almost $300 million a year, but is still willing to advertise anything that will pay up. That\u2019s why he hyped Centra Tech without even bothering to look into what it\u2019s all about. Meanwhile, they\u2019ve raised $30m and were [about to shaft their investors](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/centra-tech-sec-fraud/), but the SEC sprung into action in the nick of time and arrested the startup\u2019s bosses.\n\nParis Hilton always loved partying and drinking, but that lifestyle needs big money. So the glamour girl did some promo work for [Lydian](https://lydian.io/marketing-platform/index.php). Then a few weeks later, she deleted the tweet and claimed she had no links to the startup. Why, oh why? Maybe because the [community managers are evil](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2389995.0) or because the website with revolutionary solutions from genius Gurbaksh Chahal was made 6 months ago for [200 bucks](https://www.scamadviser.com/check-website/davinci11.com) or because of his [court cases](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/09/25/as-founder-faces-possible-jail-time-an-inside-look-at-lydiancoin-paris-hilton-endorsed-cryptocurrency/#1d823ce17cca) for harassment and domestic violence. By the way, it\u2019s a great story: you get sued, so you hold an ICO to raise money for lawyers or your new life on a tropical island. Profit.\n\n[Read more](https://shitcoinoffering.com/celebrities-and-crypto-trust-or-avoid/)",

We are launching a \u201creverse-ICO\u201d which works a bit different than typical ICOs. Essentially, it is an established company, with a solid track record of revenue and a working product/solution holding an initial coin offering. This is opposite of typical ICOs where companies that simply have a concept or whitepaper, raise money to fund development and marketing.\n\nOur project  will pave the road to include end-users like yourselves to be able to participate in making not only the the web a more secure place, but the emerging blockchain industry itself. The free and universal security application we\u2019re developing will not only protect users from malicious activity (phishing sites, scams, hijacked domains, etc), but anonymously donate data to our AI based deep learning neural network called VISION which then secures the data onto the open blockchain. The more people use the application to secure their devices, the stronger the network gets.\n\n**About VISION:**\n\nThis project, [which you can learn more about here,](https://www.cloudbric.io/vision) was a collaborative effort between the Cloudbric team, PhD Scholars from  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Korea University, and M.I.T. Initial tests have shown a stunning 85% increase in accuracy for filtering out false positive threat data. VISION will be an integral part of the platform.\n\n**Why Blockchain?**\n\nBy utilizing the blockchain, the data will be accessible to anyone, and the CLB rewarding system will be transparent and will not be susceptible frauders trying to claim more CLB.\n\nYou can learn more about our ICO here  [https://www.cloudbric.io](https://www.cloudbric.io/) and the CLB token usage here: [CLB Usage, Utility, & Value](https://www.cloudbric.io/token-sales#usage).\n\n# Ask Me Anything on September 27, 10PM to 1AM EST (September 28, 2AM to 5AM GMT)\n\nThe AMA's focus will be on one of the most prevalent issues in the crypto space: hacking.\n\nDuring that time period you have the opportunity to ask us anything and everything including questions on the current state of cybersecurity in the crypto space, our AI-based deep learning neural network module called VISION, our future plans, and anything related to cybersecurity, information-security, and blockchain.\n\nGet those questions ready, as the top questions asked on the AMA thread can earn you a juicy bounty **reward of up to 10,000 CLB tokens (\\~1 ETH at ICO price)**. Well-informed questions about cybersecurity, net-sec, or specifically blockchain security, especially if tied in with Cloudbric and its suite of tools will have the most potential to gain the highest rewards\u00a0\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Relevant Cloudbric Links**\n\nWebsite: [https://www.cloudbric.io/](https://www.cloudbric.io/)\n\nWhitepaper: [https://ico.cloudbric.io/upload/file/Cloudbric\\_Whitepaper\\_EN.pdf](https://ico.cloudbric.io/upload/file/Cloudbric_Whitepaper_EN.pdf)\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/cloudbric](https://t.me/cloudbric)",

In our 3+ years of servicing, one thing that we noticed is that all users recognize the need for cybersecurity (or in our case web application security), but most tend to shy away from proactively utilizing any security solutions...until they get hacked. To be perfectly honest, cybersecurity isn't the most sexy topic out there, but it is certainly a needed solution.\n\nWhat our team wanted to do was devise a way to incentivize users to begin actively adopting cybersecurity best practices and one way that we could do this is to provide users with security rewards through our tokens. In addition, decentralizing the cyber threat information that we compiled from our users around the world need added verification and authentication to ensure that certain IPs, spam URLs, fraud wallet addresses, etc. are in fact malicious. We can achieve this from the blockchain.",

                    "response": " Decentralized threat data is valuable for analysts on common needs, but challenging to enact in a timely manner.\n\nFor example, National Vulnerability Database, the centralized repository for vulnerability disclosure in the United States, relies on vendors reporting vulnerabilities and their possible impact. This means 1. The database is not comprehensive (but it\u2019s pretty good), 2. There is frequently a delay in vulnerability disclosure to the database, with a median of 7 days from vendor disclosure to disclosure in NVD.\n\nCommon open threat feeds can suffer from the same fate when using threat intelligence platforms or security services, like MSSPs, to aggregate. In one example, I was working with a client who saw an indicator in their SIEM popping us as ransomware C2 according to a well known threat feed. When they reached out to their MSSP for more context, they were told that the IOC actually aged out a few days prior. They were not pleased.\n\nAnother challenge is the inherent difficulty in accessing and aggregating the data in the first place. David Bianca\u2019s Pyramid of Pain is a great way to understand difficulty vs value. Low level IOCs, like detecting malicious IPs and hashes is relatively trivial (e.g. Broad scanning servers for signatures of RAT controllers; Shodan has a malware scanner for this). Other data, like endpoint telemetry from a broad spectrum of personal and commercial enterprises or criminal actors on dark web forums for discussions of exploit proof-of-concept code is a whole other consideration. These are expensive to access and maintain, require special technology and knowledge, and are far more valuable as they give insight to adversary tools and TTPs.\n\nHope this provides some insight.\n\nCitation: [https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-disclosure-delay/](https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-disclosure-delay/)\n\nHow do you respond to this?

We hope to transition our current user base to the upcoming platform and will also look to tap into the mobile device market, which has more than 6 billion active devices on the market. Personally, I think many ICOs, exchanges, and other blockchain based business see the true need for security already and it's only a matter of time when end users really see what's at stake with their digital assets/money. This will lend to more users naturally seeking cybersecurity specifically geared toward protecting cryptocurrencies and blockchain businesses. However, a lot of cybersecurity ICO projects out in the space do not actually provide real solutions/products to counteract attacks, but merely provide an open database of attack information. This is where Cloudbric will play a major role since we are industry experts and have a strong track record of success.",

We're creating a technology solution for crypto traders and investors, from research to portfolio mgmt and trade alerts. For example, as an ICO investor you have to look at lots of data (reddit posts, read whitepapers etc) wouldnt it be great it you could use some awesome tools, like Natural Language Processing (NLP) to help you do those tasks, faster and with more data than you could ever do just reading. And even if you are ok with your own investment process think of the thousands of crypto traders and investors we can help\n\nIf that sounds interesting, check us out. We're going to disrupt a multi billion dollar industry if we can build the right community. Really we are building a technology platform for a decentralized community of developers and data scientists who will build out all the different crypto analytic tools. \n\nHappy to answer more questions just shoot me a message or leave a comment.

            "text": "Just a few years ago, businesses could have set up shop easily in Singapore. Income from illegal activities could then be redirected into legitimate assets or businesses, hiding its dirty roots.\n\nBut not anymore \u2013 businesses now need to undergo due diligence checks, such as declaring funding sources. There have been stricter regulations, which led to the increased importance of know-your-customer (KYC) processes for businesses.\n\nInevitably, with an increased pickup of fintech comes the need to monitor and keep new players accountable.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt about it, financial technology \u2013 aka fintech \u2013 is rapidly gaining acceptance. In particular, the ASEAN region has seen a sharp rise in fintech funding. Investment in Southeast Asia\u2019s fintech market is expected to reach US$338 million in 2017, according to a white paper from United Overseas Bank (UOB) that cited data from analytics firm Tracxn.\n\nKYC is a process that allows businesses to identify who their customers are. This is particularly important to financial companies, as it lets them put faces to client names, preventing illegal activities like money laundering, tax evasion, or terrorist financing.\n\nAs Samson Leo, co-founder of online payment platform Xfers puts it, \u201cyou want to make sure that they do not use your business for illegal purposes, putting at risk not just your business, but other people as well.\u201d\n\nKYC also helps assess and monitor customer risk, and Southeast Asian companies are legally required to comply with global Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Terrorist Financing (CFT) Laws.\n\nhttps://www.techinasia.com/explaining-kyc-fintech-startups\n\nI am trying to do my due-diligence on E-KYC solution on blockchain, as this help to solve a lot of identification problem and it best to be done on blockchain..\n\nthere are earlier project like CIVIC and a lot more newer solution project like Selfkey, Xenchain, Uport, and etc.\n\ni like the e-kyc spaces, anyone can inspire me on how to analyze the KYC technology and which one most likely will be successful?\n\nthanks in advance\n",

No scams could get through us!! Remember, we all want the same thing, cuz we\u2019re all invested together. \n\nNo max investment, whales welcome, but you need to be in with at least 1 ether. That way we leave behind those who aren\u2019t serious. Ain\u2019t nobody got time for that!\n\nWith that insane buy-in volume we could negotiate better presale deals and get presale prices in mainsales for any ICO pre-sales we missed out on. GAINZ!!!\n\nThen a small portion of our returns gets put in a community pot, and is paid out to those of us that actually do the best and most due diligence work. \n\nBut either way, everyone wins because we don\u2019t fall for these f\u2014king scams, and our ICO investments were made with (collectively) 1000s of hours of analyzing done behind it. \n\nAlso new ICOs won\u2019t be able to spam our space (like they do here) with unwanted announcements. It just wouldn\u2019t be possible. \n\nThere\u2019s also tons of \u201cnew money\u201d in the crypto space that would be willing to back that. They don\u2019t even wanna join in on what we think is fun, but just give us their cryptos to be apart of our super-community. More leverage!!!\n\nUpvote if yes, comment why it wouldn\u2019t if no. \n\nCould it work? We\u2019d need to work out the details. But could it work? ",

            "text": "CREDITS project, which still has to go through the ICO phase in Feb, is still flying under the radar, especially there is not much talk about it on Reddit. I am writing this thread to bring this project to the attention of people on Reddit.\n\nICO was planned for January, but in order to gain complete customers confidence CREDITS moved their ICO date from January to Feb to launch Alpha version first before taking crowd sale investments. They have done this step to ensure that what they are talking about is achievable and they have the product ready for investors to test before investing. In my opinion, this is a good strategy on their part and this will differentiate them from other projects that are on paper or still in development phase.\n\nAs to what they are offering in the Blockchain space is looking very promising and advanced compare to what is currently available. Below is the presentation link that contains Technical Comparison of CREDITS with other Blockchain.\n\nhttps://credits.com/Content/Docs/CREDITSdeckENG.pdf\n\nI've requested CREDITS to create their community page on Reddit, as it will bring awareness to larger audience. Currently they have about 6.5k members on the telegram group.\n\nBelow is the cut and paste summary of CREDITS from their website (www.credits.com)\n\nCREDITS is an open blockchain platform with autonomous smart contracts and an internal cryptocurrency. The platform is designed to create services for blockchain systems using self-executing smart contracts and public data registry.\n\nThe platform can execute more than 1,000,000 transactions per second and has an execution time of 0.01 seconds. Because transaction fees are minimal, high-volume applications are possible in a way that no other available blockchain can match.\n\nCREDITS platform is the first completely autonomous blockchain system. The platform offers a new, extended application programming interface (API) that utilizes a Turing system capable of creating services using cycles, schedules, and unique functions. No other platform offers smart contract execution speeds near those of CREDITS. In addition, the CREDITS platform can function completely autonomously and without the need for external systems participation. Accordingly, CREDITS is fundamentally differentiated from all other current blockchain platforms.\n\nWe believe that blockchain technology is suitable for financial and loan services, trade, medicine, identification, exchanges, Internet of things (IoT) services, and many other applications, some of which cannot yet be imagined.\n\nCREDITS unique blockchain technology offers paradigm-shifting capabilities to industries, applications, and users who require unmatched scalability. The addressable market for these services is estimated to be worth trillions of dollars.\n\n ",

After two years of development, multiple iterations and months of testing, RewardMob successfully launched its beta in August of 2017. In January 2018, the product was fully launched worldwide utilizing the Waves blockchain. RewardMob is working with multiple development studios and publishers on integrating our reward platform into their games and has several in-house titles available. \n\nThe emergence of the blockchain has been an important enabler of the RewardMob platform. It allows us to create a better environment for our players, game developers and advertising partners. We can increase the speed and time of payments to both our players and game developers and are able to lower the cost typically associated with these transactions. Our goal is to make the RMOB token the standard in mobile game currency.\n\nWhitepaper is here: https://ticketsale.rewardmob.com/rewardmob-whitepaper.pdf\n\nAnn thread is here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2841331\n\nWeb site is here: http://rewardmob.com/",

Therefore, we decided to categorize top cryptocurrencies by industry/field they operate in.\nCategories file with 300+ crypto map is [here](https://matchcoins.info/300-crypto-map-matchcoins-info.pdf).\n\n\n**Observations**\n\nAfter going through 300+ coins\u2019 websites, reviews and sometimes even whitepapers, one by one, we\u2019ve noticed a few issues:\n\n* There\u2019s a lot of projects but only a small number of them solve real-world problems. There are so many similar projects without any use cases, or potential real users.\n* Most coins aim to solve the same problems and focus on the same broad use cases.\n* A large number of projects claim to be \"better, faster, bigger, etc.\" yet fail to provide any sustainable competitive advantage\n* With a few exceptions, the vast majority of blockchain platforms (Smart contracts and dApps) don't offer clear significant benefits against the established players. In addition, they don\u2019t provide services that would help attract new users, e.g. helping them integrate users\u2019 products into the platform, and they don\u2019t suggest any other ways of how they will attract a critical number of users. This will likely result in a large number of zombie platforms serving small numbers of companies.\n* Similarly, only top3, maybe top5 projects within each category should dominate, while the rest would struggle to attract users or cease to exist, unless they pivot to focus on specific small niches within their markets\n* Many projects fail to clearly communicate what they actually do and why they exist, i.e. what are their benefits against competition. In some cases, we needed to really go deep into their whitepapers or even discussion boards to understand what they actually do.\n* In cases when a project aims to solve a specific problem, it seems to have much lower market cap potential compared to crypto projects that are impossible to link to traditional companies or industries\n* Top 3 categories of the reviewed projects: Finance (29%), Digital cash (21%), Smart contracts and dApps (16%)\n\n\n\n\n**Categories** ([check the 300+ crypto map](https://matchcoins.info/300-crypto-map-matchcoins-info.pdf))\n\nCategories are available on MatchCoins.info, currently as a feature of coin comparison. In addition, we\u2019ve assembled all the top projects into a Crypto Map for you to see the big picture here. Enjoy!  If you have any suggestions, we\u2019d appreciate your feedback.\n\n\n\n\n**MatchCoins.info tool**\n\nMatchCoins.info is a cryptocurrency comparison and research tool. Use it to:\n 1. Estimate the potential of a coin by adjusted market cap and total/circulating supply\n 2. Check coin\u2019s major competitors and how they compare in relevant categories\n \n\n\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe coins have been categorized based on our own research and opinions.

They pay for the fees by creating tokens, but the token holders determine how many new tokens are created to cover the fees for each year. This could explode, especially if you missed the BNB/KCS bull run that happened.\n\nDecentralized exchange . Account balances of traders will be held by a decentralized, independent smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, not by the exchange.\n\nZero trading fees.\n\nTraders need DGTX tokens to trade. So they will be much more in demand than KCS and BNB.\n\n1,000,000,000 initial supply, which is 1/100 of Tron(TRX) supply. Price per token $0.01\n\nBuilt using the Elixir programming language and partners with 'Plataformatec', a software company founded by Jose Valim, the creator of the Elixir language.\n\nThe team consists of the developer and also the owner of a successful UK trading platform (Betfair Sports Trading Software for Mac & PC from RacingTraders https://racingtraders.co.uk/ ) which has been in existence for some years (see their twitter https://twitter.com/racingtraders or google them). Other team members are experienced too.\n\nSign up using just your email and you receive 1000 DGTX tokens for free each time when someone signs up using your referral link. Do it before Jan 15 , when token sale starts. 1 DGTX is $0.01 as of now. Additional 1000 DGTX to you if that someone also refers friends. Still additionally you get 30% of the ETH your friends spend in the DGTX token sale. You get them after Jan 15.\n\nPlease use my referral if you found this post useful: https://vrlps.co/a?pt=24egHeF-mYgN9sCzFHAbpvZzKrw&referralCode=r18dziCmG&refSource=copy\n\nPodcast with the CEO: https://juicestorm.com/podcast/307-digitex-futures-exchange-adam-todd/\n\nAbout him: https://racingtraders.co.uk/about/adam-todd.html\n\nFYI - The team is vested for a year before they can sell any of their tokens.",

If a coin is worth like $0,02 the exponential growth you can reach is faster to reach and will be higher, this is simple math.\n\nNow as some of you know Binance and KuCoin released their own coins which went very successful already.\n\nNeedless to say this coin did very well so far and with more and more people using exchanges like Binance it will only improve even more!\n\nI have spent the last weeks checking ICO talks, bitcointalk and reading in telegram group, also directly talking to the devs and teams of several ICOs. I went rly deep into this ICO of Coinmetro as I can see that this will DIRECTLY COMPETE with Binance, Bittrex etc.\n\nThey have the tech, the dev, the ideas and combine the best out of these exchanges which results into a platform made for all kind of traders, beginners and experienced. This is rly the next big deal. If you want to know more you should check the page and join the telegram group which is this one:\n\nhttps://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@CoinMetro (highly active, the CEO answers all questions, he did not miss ONE question in the time I've been there)",

So I decided I`d try my hand at it and hopefully catch some new comers and give them some good information on where to look and some hard lessons i've learned hopefully also pointing you to the general places to get better information.\n\nI`ve made a couple of mistakes so far and the worst one is panicking when I have done my research on an investment but selling because of panic. If you have done your research and you believe an investment will work stick to your convictions and if you have to sell, consider rather selling a portion.\n\nThe FOMO is real if a coin has already shot up 30% and you`re not on the train rather not buy you've probably missed it and you might be buying the top but there are exceptions though, this is crypto after all, so just make sure.\n\nThese reddit pages and the discussions are very helpful and can help to point you to new coins that can potentially make you allot of money. I have found the coolest random investments because of some of these threads. Just be cautious and always do your own research first.\n\nHave goals for your investments and stick to them don't be afraid to take some profits when you're not sure about the future of an investment anymore. Greed can make you do stupid things that's why goals are always a good thing and I try to stick to mine. Profit is profit even if a coin continues on it's moon bound mission and you decided to pull that ripcord float back to earth.\n\nIf you don't know about it yet https://coinmarketcap.com/ shows all valuations from top to bottom, a good tool for seeing upcoming events I have found is http://coinmarketcal.com/ you can see all upcoming dates for coins and see if the price might shoot up for some juicy new news.\n\nSome nice exchanges are Bittrex and Binance, just including a referral link for binance ;), https://www.binance.com/?ref=10780386 . Those two are very nice and easy to use with decent trading volume, then there's also etherdelta if you want to trade with smaller upcoming coins, but do some research on it before you use it.\n\nYoutube like all all other areas of life is also really helpfull there are some excellent channels out there that give really good advice one I really like is Crypt0 ,his videos are very helpfull. But search youtube and find someone you like they can be a bit weird at time and some kind of give you a vibe of some guy with a trench coat in an alley wanting to sell you the future. Don't want to make this post too long so hopefully this helps someone to making millions or gets you on the path! Good luck!",

We are launching a \u201creverse-ICO\u201d which works a bit different than typical ICOs. Essentially, it is an established company, with a solid track record of revenue and a working product/solution holding an initial coin offering. This is opposite of typical ICOs where companies that simply have a concept or whitepaper, raise money to fund development and marketing.\n\nOur project  will pave the road to include end-users like yourselves to be able to participate in making not only the the web a more secure place, but the emerging blockchain industry itself. The free and universal security application we\u2019re developing will not only protect users from malicious activity (phishing sites, scams, hijacked domains, etc), but anonymously donate data to our AI based deep learning neural network called VISION which then secures the data onto the open blockchain. The more people use the application to secure their devices, the stronger the network gets. \n\n**About VISION:** \n\nThis project, [which you can learn more about here,](https://www.cloudbric.io/vision) was a collaborative effort between the Cloudbric team, PhD Scholars from  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Korea University, and M.I.T. Initial tests have shown a stunning 85% increase in accuracy for filtering out false positive threat data. VISION will be an integral part of the platform.\n\n**Why Blockchain?**\n\nBy utilizing the blockchain, the data will be accessible to anyone, and the CLB rewarding system will be transparent and will not be susceptible frauders trying to claim more CLB. \n\nYou can learn more about our ICO here  [https://www.cloudbric.io](https://www.cloudbric.io/) and the CLB token usage here: [CLB Usage, Utility, & Value](https://www.cloudbric.io/token-sales#usage).\n\n# Ask Me Anything on September 24, 9AM to 12PM EST\n\nThe AMA's focus will be on one of the most prevalent issues in the crypto space: hacking.\n\nDuring that time period you have the opportunity to ask us anything and everything including questions on the current state of cybersecurity in the crypto space, our AI-based deep learning neural network module called VISION, our future plans, and anything related to cybersecurity, information-security, and blockchain.\n\nGet those questions ready, as the top questions asked on the AMA thread can earn you a juicy bounty **reward of up to 10,000 CLB tokens (\\~1 ETH at ICO price)**. Well-informed questions about cybersecurity, net-sec, or specifically blockchain security, especially if tied in with Cloudbric and its suite of tools will have the most potential to gain the highest rewards\u00a0\ud83d\udd25 \n\n**Relevant Cloudbric Links**\n\nWebsite: [https://www.cloudbric.io/](https://www.cloudbric.io/)\n\nWhitepaper: [https://ico.cloudbric.io/upload/file/Cloudbric\\_Whitepaper\\_EN.pdf](https://ico.cloudbric.io/upload/file/Cloudbric_Whitepaper_EN.pdf)\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/cloudbric](https://t.me/cloudbric)",

            "text": "http://primalbase.com\n_______________\n**Primalbase - Shared Workspaces on Tokens**\nReal estate is probably one of the most conservative areas of the economy while Blockchain is considered a disruptive technology about to change the world.\n_______________\nYou probably know WeWork - it\u2019s a great idea to have a shareable infrastructure with a global community. We know many other projects like this, and we believe that crypto tokens would fit perfectly well into this model. That\u2019s how we came up with the idea of Primalbase, an all-inclusive sharable workspace at the very heart of the world\u2019s top tech hubs with a crypto-token membership bought only once. It\u2019s scalable, fast to set up, flexible in terms of timing and the size of the team.\n_______________\nThe first stage of Primalbase shareable infrastructure development requires the setup of 5 shared workspaces of up to 2000 square meters in the following strategic locations most beneficial for tech entrepreneurs: Amsterdam, Berlin, London, New York, Hong Kong. The efficiency and profitability of Primalbase business model lie in the approach to divide the infrastructure into rentable offices (based on classic, standard real estate relations) and non-rentable co-working spaces (based on crypto-economic relations) reserved only for Primalbase community members. \n_______________\nIf anyone outside of the community wants to rent Primalbase co-working space, it can be arranged by temporary ownership of the membership (renting Primalbase token from a community member). However, the underlying profit of Primalbase will be gained from renting offices to companies, project teams, startups, branch offices, etc., and it will cover the operating expenses of the property management company.\n_______________\nThe Primalbase cryptocurrency token is built on Waves Blockchain. There is already a proof-of-concept running in Amsterdam at full speed and receiving endorsements from prominent tech entrepreneurs from all around the world who have become members of Primalbase growing community. According to the business model described above, in Amsterdam unit there are offices rented by companies and shared workspaces available for current members of Primalbase community (Ralf Manheim, CEO at Just Sports Marketing, Sasha Ivanov, CEO at Waves Platform, Dmitry Tokarev, CTO at Dolfin, Aaron Rovner, CMO at Forsta).\n\n_______________\n**Amsterdam, Netherlands**\nAs the self-proclaimed \u201cWest Coast startup capital of Europe\u201d and \u201cworld\u2019s most connected city\u201d the Dutch are clearly not too shy to toot their own horn \u2014 and rightfully so. Amsterdam has undeniably shown itself to be in the same league as London and Berlin, attracting both international companies looking to scale-up and startups looking to benefit from the country\u2019s various incentives and programmes. In the words of Minister of Economic Affairs, Henk Kamp, the Dutch \u2018are experts at creating favourable conditions\u2019; and over the past few years, the Netherlands has successfully created and fostered the ultimate entrepreneurial business climate in their nation\u2019s capital.\n_______________\nThe Netherlands boasts a long history of disruptive companies and tech innovation, extensive transport links and a strong digital infrastructure \u2014 Shipol airport has the second largest number of connections in the world and the Amsterdam Internet Exchange (AMS-IX) is the largest data transport hub in the world. The Dutch capital is home to a growing number of top international companies who have their European headquarters in the city, including Netflix, Uber, Tesla and Cisco Systems. The city isn\u2019t short of local success story, notably TomTom, Booking.com, WeTranfer, The Next Web and fintech unicorn Ayden. Along with the city\u2019s infrastructure and access to Europe, companies are being attracted by the increasing tech talent pool. Amsterdam has an incredibly strong foundation to support knowledge, and cooperation between research institutes and business is highly encouraged. The city has around 250,000 experienced IT professionals and a wealth of top ranked technological universities which continue to pull in students internationally.\n_______________\nHome to a host of venture funds and Europe\u2019s largest incubators and accelerators, Amsterdam has also become a highly regarded startup hub in Europe. A significant part of this success can be attributed to targeted pro- entrepreneurship government policy, aimed at supporting technological development and removing practical obstacles to growth. The StartupDelta initiative introduced a \u2018startup visa\u2019 which enables entrepreneurs from outside of the EU one year to launch an innovative new business in the Netherlands and offers expats 30% of their salary tax-free. From 2017, the government has pledged 50 million dollars annually to boost startup growth and lower the wage for startup founders. Besides favourable tax codes, the Netherlands is in first place with London for Intellectual Property protection.\n_______________\nAmsterdam is already widely acknowledged as the next leading hub and start up ecosystem, and is definitely a city with both beauty and brains.\n_______________\nhttps://www.google.nl/maps/place/Helicopterstraat+25\n_____________________\nhttp://primalbase.com\n__________________________\n**More information is coming soon, including whitepaper, roadmap, sale structure, and much more!

            "text": " 1. We have explained the first advantage for using the Catex in the paragrafe above. While users pay fee to trade on normal exchanges. On Catex, these fee\u2019s are returned back to the users as Catt token with an extra bonus of 5% to their account.\n\n2. Another advantage of Catex, and maybe the most interesting one, is that the exchange is sharing it\u2019s daily dividends up to 90% back to it\u2019s users depending on the amount of Catt token it is holding. So this means that the exchange is only receiving 10% of the dividents for itself. Which is for costs like advertising, employee and development costs. The system where the daily dividents is based on, is showed in the table below.\n\n\u25cf Lock **7 \u00a0\u00a0days\t\u00a0%50** (Dividend percentage)  \n\u25cf Lock **15 days\t\u00a0%60** (Dividend percentage)  \n\u25cf Lock **30 days\t\u00a0%70** (Dividend percentage)  \n\u25cf Lock **45 days\t\u00a0%80** (Dividend percentage)  \n\u25cf Lock **60 days\t\u00a0%90** (Dividend percentage)\n\nExample calculation:  \nThe folowing information is needed for calculating the daily dividend. The total daily divident of the exchange, the total amount of Catt the user holds, the percentage based on how long the user has locked it\u2019s tokens and the total amount of Catt that is locked in the circulation supply. So lets make an example with this information.  \n\n\n1. The total divident of the exchange is 2000 USD  \n2. The user has bought 10.000.000 Catt  \n3. And locked the token for 60 days (90%)  \n4 The toal locked Catt is 500.000.000  \n\n\n10.000.000/500.000.0000=0.02  \n2000 x 90% = 1800  \n18000 x 0,02 = 36 USD (The daily dividend received byuser)\n\nNote:   \nCalculation is based on current price of Catt/BTC: 0.00000022 sats. 10.000.000 Catt is currently worth 2.2 BTC based on the current price, (BTC/USDT price at the moment is 3415.25 USD) which makes a total of 7513.55 USD. So with the example we have shown that even if the Catt/BTC price and daily dividens stays the same, the user will earn back 28.75% of it\u2019s investment after the 60 days of locking. It should also be considered that the calculaton is based on an exchange that is fairly new and still working on the awareness of the exhange in the market. The volume will increase by time, which returns in higher daily dividends for it\u2019s users. Locking the catt token is a must to receive the daily dividends, but is not required to make use of the exchange for invest/trade in othere crypto currencies.

In the short term, VELIC\u2019s proprietary secret sharing methodology will be used to safeguard VELIC\u2019s own private keys that in turn secure VELIC user\u2019s crypto assets within the platform. In time, the same infrastructure will be made available to users. VELIC Vault applies predefined rules to \r\nencrypt, fractionize and securely distribute the user\u2019s private keys for safe storage \r\nnodes operated by trusted third parties. The private keys are stored in a manner \r\nin which none of the storage nodes (nor VELIC) will have access to the actual private keys on its own. When the user requests recovery of the private keys (and therefore access to crypto assets), VELIC Vault triggers a similar set of predefined rules that retrieves the user\u2019s private key for usage. This way, VELIC Vault enables \r\nthe user to delete his/her own private keys when not in use, and synthesize and utilize private keys only when needed, thereby eliminating one of the most important vulnerability points relating to private key management - owner\u2019s own key client.\nWebsite:https://www.velic.io/",

TraverlerToken does not have a clearinghouse for loyalty rewards. They do however propose to include a debit card. Something planned for Gozo in 2019. \nThere was an attempt by Alloy and Global Rewards Network to allow the users of partnered brands and  \npublishers to link, combine and convert all their reward points to a local  at equivalent ($/\u00a5/\u20ac) which, in turn,  \nmay be redeemed against listed products and services from other partnering brands in a closed ecommerce  \nstore. \nTravelCoin is a community built, not for pro t organization focused mainly on travel bookings as well. They launched their ICO in 2017 and appears to be running a perpetual ICO based on tranches. They have included  \nthe points to token conversion in their roadmap for 2018. They also included a wallet to have been launched  \nin December 2017. Thus far, as of July 2018, it appears no wallet is available for download. \n\n\n\nUnique Focus and Feature Set \nThe above ICOs in the travel space have a heavy reliance on the supply side for adoption. Gozo will primarily focus on the demand side, consumer-end, providing immediate tangible value, with the universal blockchain  \nGozo wallet, a liate crypto token rebates, built-in loyalty reward clearinghouse and PLUS member benefits access.  \nOnly Gozo focuses on unifying the disparate travel loyalty rewards programs where hundreds of billions of dollars in unrealized value reside. By making all travel loyalty rewards trackable, tradable and potentially convertible into other crypto or  at currencies, Gozo positions itself as the  rst mover and sole provider in this multi-trillion-dollar space. \n\n\n\n\nMassive Market Space for Multiple Competitors \nThe travel and loyalty reward industry is so large, with hundreds of billions of dollars of value being booked, earned, transferred, used, lost, and often unrealized. Between online booking ($630 billion 2017), and loyalty reward points issued ($117 billion annually), and unused ($360 billion), Gozo is directly positioned to capitalize on a $1.1 trillion dollar and growing market. A small fraction of travelers working with Gozo could result in yearly turnover in the hundreds of millions of dollars. \nConsidering the above blockchain projects in the travel space, the Gozo Team, including co-creators, expert advisors, and travel partners, strongly believe their blockchain o ering to be extremely marketable, with an opportunity for rapid adoption as  rst to market, both, organically, and through paid marketing, in this massively growing global travel and loyalty reward domain.\n\nhttps://gozo.io\n\n\nBounty0x Username: Osoname",

            "text": "Hi guys. I'm a bit confused if this is the right place to post because the ICO has passed, but the coin recently hit public markets and prices are still hovering around ICO levels, so I wanted to spread some awareness because I was surprised with the lack of awareness and impressed with what I've found.\n\nSo LTO (Liquid Task Orchestration) started in 2014 with a centralized solution on process automation. Essentially they were tasked with increasing efficiency in their client's organization. Eventually their clients got bigger and more countries became involved. This collaboration with outside parties necessitated a protection of data, so blockchain was introduced.\n\nSo real-world clients. This is where I was truly blown away. They aren't cornering themselves to one industry. Instead they've established footholds in supply chain, real estate, document mgmt, insurance, notary services, and more. Their end users are B2B like governments, multinationals, and enterprises. Here is a list of some of their clients: **MSeven, CMS Law, Heineken, Generali, Cemex, Stena Line, Deloitte, Damste Notary, Euronext, Merin, Dekra, Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure, Dutch Ministry of Justice, Belgium Ministry of Infrastructure**. These are multibillion dollar businesses. \nFind all the contracts with all their multinational partners here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gn0iJvQHurCTgBuZfk1ypK3nIJKsWxMn\nAnd see here https://messari.io/asset/lto-network for company background, sale stages, audits, etc.\n\nThe team seems mighty experienced. The CEO, Rick Schmitz, has a PriceWaterhouseCooper background and previously led Firm24, the biggest legal process automater in the Netherlands (they handled almost 10% of every legal corporate dealing in the country). The lead architect, Arnold Daniels, is a web dev with 18 yrs experience. His github is quite prolific (https://github.com/jasny). Check out the rest of the team on LinkedIn (https://lto.network/index.html#meet-the-team). Overall the team demonstrates themselves as a powerhouse of talent all with niche skills and overlapping skills to successfully complement, build, and execute.\n\nICO Results\n\n**Seed Round / Private Sale Price**: $0.024\n\n**ICO Price**: $0.03\n\n**Current Price**: $0.054\n\n**Private/seed sale value**: $3,100,000\n\n**Crowdsale gathered amount**: $984,000\n\n**Total Raised**: $4,084,000\n\n**Current Marketcap**: $2,092,195\n\nThe money raised from ICO was immediately converted to fiat. Which means they have some cushioning for expansion (administration, new devs, marketing, etc) on top of being revenue generating. So they didn't raise a lot of money but they have proven business results and seem like they know how to use the money responsibly. As far as investors dumping on market launch, they've implemented a troll bridge mechanism to protect the crowd. Basically it starts with a 55% tax if private investors wish to withdraw to market. The taxed coins themselves are burned out of existence. This troll bridge fee decays to zero over six months and currently sits at 38.6%. They are very transparent with their tokenomics. See here https://ltonode.com/supply/ and watch all coins move to liquid erc20 network here https://t.me/troll_bridge.\n\nThe current crypto market environment has decimated many ICOs of 2017-2018. Meanwhile few projects like these stand out in harsh conditions proving they can build sustainable business models, palpable results, and a lasting impact. In summary, I'm really excited to see what LTO Network produces in the coming weeks. Apparently there's quite a few updates planned which is causing quite a stir of growth among the community. You can buy/sell LTO on Bitmax/IDEX. It was listed on coinmarketcap two days ago (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lto-network/). Let me know your thoughts!!\n\n",

Our platform allows for cash or cashless transactions, and supports all major crypto currencies. \n\nFor easy access to the ALCEDO-Platform only a smartphone and an internet connection is necessary. With the addition of the ATM crypto system, our customers can exchange or transfer currencies (e.g.EUR) with hardly any effort into crypto currencies, and vice versa. These transactions follow an easy to understand structure and are subject to the highest security standards. Transactions usually incur small fees, which can be exempted when using the ALCEDO-Platform. In order to enjoy such exemption of fees, the customer should have deposited a small number of ALCEDO-Coins on the ALCEDO-Platform (see: Wallet). If a customer does not have ALCEDO-Coins, then a small fee is due. This concept makes it possible for any customer, young and old alike, to easily participate in this new technology. It facilitates access and handling of crypto currencies. The ALCEDO concept is fundamentally different from other ICO\u2019s. Our platform / service is a universal and free solution for everyone who wants to utilize any type of crypto currency. Very important: The first ALCEDO-Point has already opened on September 1, 2018 and our customers are in a position already to buy/sell crypto currencies over the counter, completely independent of the ICO. All this has been financed without external funding. In addition, we have the resources to continue the project financially after the ICO. Our main goal is the service to our customers by setting up -POINTS supported by our service experts and crypto machines ",

While it utilizes blockchain technology it is very different from popular crypto blockchains by\u00a0focusing on a high performance distribution network using consensus based decisions and a specialized payment verification process. It is capable of performing exceptionally high transactions per second which scales as you add more nodes and also has the important ability to self-repair the network in the event of subset of nodes going offline from events such as a large scale network outage or a denial of service attack. Another key feature of the Ultra Network is the multi-layer currency that we are implementing to run on the network combined with multi-layer wallets. This opens up the ability to separate your money into day to day use or long term savings or operate a business with multiple employees accessing the single limited spending account. We feel this will allow the use of our network and currency to be incorporated into a broader range of uses in our everyday lives.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat sets our network apart from current systems:\n\n* No transactions fees.\n* No Mining. Users are required to hash, but not continuously hash. Users are rewarded for participating in the network\u00a0as a node.\n* Lower storage requirements.\n* The more nodes the higher the performance and resilience of the network.\n* High transaction rates (throughput over 50,000 TPS)\n* Fast validation and transaction confirmation that will allow processing suitable for use by retail and the food industry.\n* Wallets that are customized for usage cases and have unique roles (Single user, Family, Company)\n* Ability for Families or Companies to issue spending limits for a pool of money\n* Consensus based decisions\n* Reputation system to remove potential hackers or corrupt nodes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur long-term goals are to create a sustainable day to day currency. Immediately after launch we will begin working on:\n\n* Multifactor authentication\n* Mobile App to transfer funds or tap to pay when ready (IOS, Android)\n* Conditional Transactions with 3rd Party support\n* A opt-in user-friendly name system for wallet addresses built into the network\u00a0(similar to domain names) for simplicity and to allow verification before sending funds\n* Retail Point of Sale systems with tap to pay support with\u00a0tap cards (like debit/credit cards)\n* Decentralized Databases and network content (more information to come, will be an optional add-on for those who want to earn coins)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ultra Network team has been hard at work building a new innovative decentralized and will be able to provide a demo in the near future.

Investors see huge opportunity and jump on board more and more ICOs.\n\n**9 months ago:** ICOs are all the rage, with huge profits to be made. Heaps of investors jump in head first. Coins launch on exchanges at similar to ICO price, though some big profits and some big losses made.\n\n**6 months ago:** Investors have become more cautious. The top ICOs have become better quality. Although the quality of the good ICOs has increased, there are many scams too. When coins launch on exchanges most quickly fall to below ICO price (many due to big bonuses offered in private and pre-sales).\n\n**3 months ago:** ICO deadzone. ICOs need to raise funds privately as no one is risking it in public sales. Only ICOs which raised majority of funds privately succeed in their public sales.\n\n**Now:** ICO market has picked up a bit, I think it's dropped enough that current ICOs have potential to launch above ICO price.\n\nIn my opinion, it's only worth investing in ICOs which already have a product with a large amount of users. New products need to fight with the existing centralised companies and it is too risky and unlikely they will succeed and give their tokens value in the short term. The other point to note is the industry of the ICOs. Many industries have been inundated with decentralised products such as Social Networks, Cloud Storage and Loan providers. An ICO looking to compete in these industries is just too high risk. Both against traditional centralised companies and new decentralised alternatives.\n\nI'm still investing in ICOs, but am a lot more picky than previously because I think this is where the real potential lies.\n\nOne current ICO I am looking at is Cosplay Token. Why? I know it's a bit left field - but as a cosplayer i see the industry is pretty niche, with low competition and they also have 720,000 users on their platform. Just one other token competing with them and only like one or two other big cosplay websites. The other thing is cosplayers and crypto audience have quite an overlap.\n\nIt's an interesting one though, because I'm not sure how non-cosplayers would see it (i am a cosplay fan). What do you think?\n\n**Discussion points:** What are your thoughts on the ICO market? Are ICOs going to struggle, is the market saturated with 'tech' products and needs to hit more niche industries? What ICOs do you aim for? Or are you out of the ICO market completely for now?\n\nI'm also looking to delve into a few more ICOs so post a few suggestions to look at. NO IDEAS WITH NO PRODUCTS PLEASE. I'm sick of them.  \n\n\n**Declaration:** I haven't yet but I will probably purchase some cosplay token which is the one I mentioned. Though will see what people say here",

Also from an investment perspective there are altcoins that are established with good funding, which are a tenth of their ATH. They present lower risks with decent gains. ICOs need to perform very well to beat the potential gains on some of these coins.\n\nAnother factor is release times. Many recent ICOs are taking months to unlock because of the bear market or from poor project management. It puts off investors to have capital locked away, whereas investing in established altcoins allows more flexible access to funds.\n\nFinally cosplayer token sounds a bit too niche. Unless the funding goal is minor it is unlikely to retain value especially if its fully based on utility.",

My contact shared a few tips about approaching them in the future, which might be pertinent to upcoming conversations any of the teams here doing an ICO could have.\n\n1. **Private preferred over public** - Their blockchain team is blockchain agnostic, but typically less open to partnership with public blockchain projects, as opposed to private ones.  This is largely due to where their clients are in terms of comfort/familiarity with the technology. In the future, highlighting the private blockchain element of the project would be better received as part of partnership discussions. My contact said they work with IBM's Hyperledger Fabric all the time for an example.\n\n2. **Partnership driven by platform viability** - It is unlikely they would consider partnering ahead of a minimum viable product or live proof-of-concept. Their preference is toward projects that build on top of an existing platforms to drive greater adoption.\n\nDo with this info what you will but hopefully it provides some type of perspective. At the end of the day, I wouldn't suggest privatizing your *crypto* project's blockchain to appease a partner or investor.\n",

I kept this aside for my wedding. Which will be in two to three years from now.\n\nNow I am in big trouble, as I need an amount to pay an unforeseen liability. If I liquidate ally my crypto, that would be really stupid at this point of time. As an alternate, I have $2K from the savings funds. That's all what's left with me.\n\nSo, I am planning to put this in an ICO. Not any scam project. But one, which is solid and will have a minimal roi.\n\nAfter a lot of research, I came across these two:\n\n- Qravity\n\n- Tutellus\n\nQravity: I think is pretty robust as a concept. With this decentralized Upwork+project management tools kind of approach. They even will do the distribution of the content too.\n\nThe following are the pros which I find:\n\n- Roubst concept\n\n- Solid whitepaper\n\n- Pretty epic token economics\n\n- Experiened team members\n\n- has a use of blockchain and a funtional prototype.\n\nCons:\n\n- no CTO\n\n- a bit complicated for common audience\n\n- small community\n\nTutellus: P2P education on the blockchain. These guys are already in the market, kind of well established.\n\nPros:\n\n- working product\n\n- already successful and been running for multiple years\n\n- multiple engineers, successful CEO\n\nCons:\n\n- lot of competitors\n\n- lack of solid advisors\n\n- pretty small team overall\n\n- only 1 blockchain developer listed\n\nI am not at all an expert when it comes to analyzing an ICO or a candlstick.\n\nSo I would be really grateful if you guys could share your opinion.\n\nIf possible, please make it noob friendly.\n\nThanks a lot in advance.\n\nPS: Apologies for the language mistakes, as English is not my native language.",

Our main aim is to raise awareness about what are the minimum standards any contributor should demand from the projects they back.\n\nWe also have a Qfellows program ([Apply Now](https://medium.com/@concourseq/want-to-research-icos-for-the-whole-community-qfellow-season-is-here-8e502b6e42b)), which rewards selected fellows that share their research regularly on the platform.\n\nOur research is published on several sub-reddits and our [twitter](https://twitter.com/concourseqio).

In particular [u/snasps](https://www.reddit.com/u/snasps) contributes alot in [r/icocrypto](https://www.reddit.com/r/icocrypto). We consider them the real antithesis to the shade-y 'ICO Review sites' like ICOBench. We have placed them in 'Our Friends' section (not paid for) due to their continuing positive community contributions, their model of paid independent reviewers and not charging ICOs a fee. That being said we are just going on their word and the feeling of trust we have built up over time; please do your absolute worst and try tear them apart! That's what this AMA is for.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nWatch out in all of [r/icocrypto](https://www.reddit.com/r/icocrypto) AMAs for new/shady accounts feeding glowing questions.

            "text": "# ICOCRYPTO CHANGES: 17TH APRIL 2019\n\nSo as moderator of this subreddit I've locked the site from new posts aside from approved submitters. I think the main lesson learnt is that its relatively soulless being moderator of as crypto forum... I mean reddit's CEO isn't broke yet they can't work out a spam algorithm that stops people with super new accounts posting continuously all the time. I was spending 30 minutes a day being a human spam filter. From now on only approved submitters can post and as such the types of posts outlined bellow are **suspended until further notice.** I guess we have gone the same way as r/altcoin. People are requesting to run this sub but at this stage I agree with the closing post on r/altcoin and advise you to go to r/CryptoCurrency\n\n# Investment Advice\n\nYou are not really investing, you are mostly gambling. Some of these companies will likely fail to deliver a product. Maybe they never even intended to produce one.\n\n* Do not rush & Don't be greedy.\n* Do not ask: \"What is the best ICO at the moment\". Or do it if you want to create a potential non-investment list. Do your homework first.\n* Be a \"sane parano\u00efd\". People are not always what they pretend to be and scammers are gifted to seduce.\n* Due diligence is the key. You cannot just rely on other people comments, thoughts or so called \"analysis\". The interests of others are not necessarily yours.\n* Invest only what you can afford to lose.\n* Invest in something you do understand. You have to deep dive into the product: who, what, when, how? What about technology, team, market, viability, roadmap, token, supply, market cap, distribution, incentives, etc.\n* Does the product really need to be based on blockchain technology?\n* Is there a market?\n* Ask for informations. Ask again. And again. [Exemple](https://www.reddit.com/r/icocrypto/comments/71l9m2/we_are_rated_by_ico_bench_experts_now/dnch2am/).\n* Do they have a product, github, etc?\n* What about the token? Necessary? Useful? What's the use? What about the incentives to use, hold or sell it? Is there a way to sell it?\n* Access to ICO smart contract's code before the ICO? Audited? Terms of ICO / Presale? Website audited?\n* As a token holder, what do you gain?\n* In your country, what are the legal and tax implications as a token buyer/holder/seller?\n* Think about it for a minute: the company is successful and Google buy it. What happens to your investment?\n* There is no free money. If the project sounds too good to be true, just go back to \"sane parano\u00efd\" mode and take a closer look.\n* Check accounts on reddit (history, karma, redditor since, write to who and in which subreddits).\n* Caution with pyramid / ponzi schemes. How to spot them? 1) Most of the time, guaranteed return on investment. 2) Aberrant interest rates (no one can give you 1% daily, nor 10% monthly. I know you would like it, but be realistic).\n* A lot of ICO rating/due diligence services, forums and websites are in a potential conflict of interests. If the service accept donation: caution. If a company has to pay to be rated or is encouraged to make a donation to expedite the procedure: caution. If the service shill the iCO: caution. If the rating service is also acting as an exchange, intermediary, consultant: caution. Just four examples: [IcoBazaar.com](https://icobazaar.com/terms), [Icodrops.com](https://icodrops.com/submit-ico/), [Icobench.com](https://icobench.com/publish), [Icobriefing.com](https://www.icobriefing.com/).\n* Spread the awareness.\n\nTwo exemples of simple and efficient due diligence: [\\#1](https://np.reddit.com/r/icocrypto/comments/6j4ezt/beware_of_scams_ico_investing_rules/dncfmbo/), [\\#2](https://www.reddit.com/r/icocrypto/comments/71l9m2/we_are_rated_by_ico_bench_experts_now/dnch2am/).\n\n# Rules and Regulations for r/icocrypto\n\n**Never forget: in** [r/icocrypto](https://www.reddit.com/r/icocrypto)**, you will also find links to fake websites, false ICO addresses, useless or fraudulent ICOs and many other charming things. Be vigilant. Be extremely careful. Trust nobody!**\n\nAfter consultation with a number of members and discussion between mods we have updated the way this sub works.\n\n**Types and structures of posts (with the required flair)**\n\n1. **Scam alerts** **- FREE**\n2. **User news** \\- this is news which can be submitted by general redditors. If the redditor is talking about a specific ICO, they must have **NO AFFILIATION** to the company (i.e. working for or being paid to promote etc). They may hold 'coins' for the ICO but they must declare that this is the case. These posts must contain a short declaration at the start briefly explaining their connection to ICO (or lack of affiliation thereof) - see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/icocrypto/comments/8qnjqh/an_idea_whose_time_has_come_investing_in_the_2/)\n3. **AMA's** \\- once per ICO per year. These will incur a **$20 fee** for the effort on the part of the mods that will be donated to charity - see [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/icocrypto/comments/9gfs47/schedule_your_ama_now_ama_guidelines/) for more details\n4. **Updates from ICO** \\- Genuine news from ICO's on project developments and new partnerships formed. **$2 fee** to charity\n5. **Company Promo** \\- Straight up marketing from companies. You can talk about airdrops and bounties to your hearts content. **$2 fee** to charity - see [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/icocrypto/comments/8o9eda/the_5_most_common_whitepaper_mistakes/) **or**  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/icocrypto/comments/8mrsfj/hey_guys_bittotech_is_revamped_with_a_44_icobench/)\n6. **ICO review -** This is for financial journalists or general users to direct users to reviews of ICO's hosted on external sites. There **must be a declaration** including if any payment was received for the review (or lack thereof ) **- FREE - Example** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/icocrypto/comments/8ozzt1/surrus_ico_lame_mvp_hide_your_car_contribute_50/)\n\n# How to sort out a paid post\n\n1. Decide on the type of post. Typically its going to be a company promo or an update style. Its better to have done a couple of promos or what not before doing an AMA. If your doing an AMA you will need to contact the mods- see [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/icocrypto/comments/9gfs47/schedule_your_ama_now_ama_guidelines/)\n2. Donate to UNICEF in your own local fiat or send the correct amount of ETH or BTC to the following addresses;\n\n**ETH** \\- 0xf7C7bd0DbC796E1A78dCecFd2fAe55CFc5E7C39f\n\n**BTC** \\- 1AvcNvrBuLbVXZVbi2r5ndf5gDU4cY3NoT\n\n3.   In your post add a link showing the transaction has occurred (like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/icocrypto/comments/8rkdeg/05_eth_giveawaywriting_contest_by_bandz_pmed_mod/)) or send mods proof that payment has occured and write Donation PM'ed mods (like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/icocrypto/comments/8mrsfj/hey_guys_bittotech_is_revamped_with_a_44_icobench/)).\n\n# 4.    You don't need to contact the mods to do a promo or update. Just follow the rules!\n\nThe purpose of the fees is to stop constant updates and hourly spamming by applying a small barrier to post though allowing even the most capital starved start-up to advertise on the sub. Moreover it should force ICO's to carefully craft attractive and thoughtful posts not regurgitate the same copied and pasted mass post. This is what the community wants -> high quality, thoughtful occasional posts from a variety of ICO companies. Not constantly seeing the same damn bullshit coin forced down our throats! We reserve the right to review fee structures in the future.\n\n**Investors - Payment to** [r/icocrypto](https://www.reddit.com/r/icocrypto) **does not indicate any validity as to the ICO! Do your own homework! We accept the donation and do ZERO due diligence on the company!**\n\nFees will be paid in BTC/ETH - no we dont accept your new ERC-20 coin as payment Mr.Zuckerberg! The Mods will share the private keys and withdrawals/donations will be regular and advertised on the forum.\n\nThings we would like to do but don't have the mod manpower at present.\n\n* A pinned post that we will update with known scams as and when they are flagged. This list will not be considered definitive but should give a good overview of the main ones.",

The goal of attracting investment is the clinical trend and its implementation into the petrol business from gasoline production to polymer production.\nTHE FUEL SECTOR OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM WAS SELECTED FOR A FEW REASONS:\n1. Until 2040, an estimated explosion in gas intake and, in particular, gas using 34 million barrels of identical oil per day - up to 93 million barrels. Calls for gas can be inferior simply because of calls for nuclear and renewable energy.\n\n2. World gasoline markets suffer a degree of demonopolization; In its extraction, processing and transportation, the position of small and medium gamers is growing.\n\n3. The Russian Federation lags far behind international trends: the pattern of the fuel business is subordinated to monopolists. The exploitation of small and medium- sized fuel fields, gasification of person areas is typically now not amongst their most important tasks.\n\n4. Gas producers are nonetheless weakly hooked up with end-users. About 80% of it's bought by way of way of intermediaries.\n\n5. Presence of 2 teams of points of the business trend within the world: technological intensive trend of transportation technologies within the sort of LNG (liquefied herbal gas), production of polymers that swap the nature and direction of commodity flows; market\u2019s\u200a\u2014\u200agrowing call for for gas, trend of substitute commerce and market pricing mechanisms.\n\n6. The RF lags far behind in wide (a) and intensive, including, in the reduction of capital expenses (b) exploitation of fuel resources.\n\nA) broad gas fields of Western Siberia are principally exhausted, and small and medium-sized gas fields of the East, which don't promise quickly returns and require new technologies, haven't yet been absolutely developed.\n\nB) the numbers are as follows. ExxonMobil and Total share investments in R&D is 1 USD per 1 ton of oil equivalent, and in Russia\u200a\u2014\u200aonly 0.2 USD;\nfrom them 90%\u200a\u2014\u200ain exploration and extraction; the gas-chemical business is\nunderfunded. RusGas depends on Kada-Neftegaz consultations to learn the specifics of the Irkutsk area (as an example): it's now not absolutely gasified, now not very thrilling to Gazprom as a consequence of low home gasoline fees and low consumption.\nBut the neighborhood administration made decisions at the move of\nNovozamyatinskaya and Baikalskaya TPPs from coal to gas and at the construction of municipal gas boilers. In 2012, forecasts for the elevate of gas production and processing within the area took into account the capability purely of the greatest deposits\u200a\u2014\u200aYaraktinsky, Dulisminsky, Kovyktinsky, Chikhansky, Verkhnechonsky. Others have been referred to as \u201cnot otherwise specified\u201d.\n\nBut small gas fields can grow to be a primary point within the advent of a chain for the production of LNG and polymers. RusGas has studied the wants of the area within the gasification of settlements and the calculations of Kada-Neftegaz for the construction of LNG crops (with infrastructure -31- 32 million USD) and methanol plants. They present the splendor of small gas fields found close to roads and chronic networks. In those cases, investing vast quantities in a pipeline is much less green than investing in production. The advised charge of gas is set 70\u201387 USD per 1000 cubic meters. meters of gas, and the charge of methanol roduced from it on FOB phrases is set 400 USD per ton. Ex factory\u200a\u2014\u200a300 USD.\n\nWith sleek technologies, the value of gas uncooked material per 1 ton of methanol is 860 cubic meters. m of gas. From 1 ton of methanol, it's likely to achieve 460 kg of polyolefins\u200a\u2014\u200ahigh-molecular compounds. Polyethylenes and polypropylenes are approx, half of annual intake of plastics in Europe. Technology is improving. Thus, the extension of the chain for processing uncooked material will increase the diploma of its monetization. RusGas and its investors will make investments in technology for all stages, from extraction to polymer production. Initially, the pattern might be implemented in medium-sized enterprises now not via sale, but in substitute for a share of the product (which may be very prospective), and can keep fees from 15 to 25% in extraction, garage and most importantly in production. Token house proprietors will achieve tokenized gas and at the RusGas platform will choose for themselves regardless of even if they ought to elevate the time and efficiency of the return: regardless of even if to promote gas as chronic or to finance one-of-a-kind tiers of processing. By the similar principles, they might be capable to reinvest profits.\n\nEnergy startups within the global have began utilizing blocking technology to sell\nenergy\u2019s surplus to small firms and individuals, but they're much now not up to RusGas\u2019s concentrated at the use of gas in industries. The wants of the municipalities of the area coincide with the abilities of the block chain technology, already examined within the electricity sector by a couple of platforms, incl. WePower: the holder of the token can purchase chronic immediately from the company and promote the surplus to the network.\n\nRusGas plans to make investments virtually the whole quantity of 20% of the team\u2019s share in medical development. As within the initiatives of this elegance there shouldn't be any doubt the achievement of the Soft Cap level, the investments will make at the very least 600 000 USD. Investments of Russian firms in R&D are on usual 0.2 USD per 1 ton of oil equivalent. Formally, 600 000 USD might \"cover\" 3 million plenty of oil equivalent. Gas intake within the oil an identical within the global by 2040 will elevate by 34 million barrels, or 4,637,600 plenty per day and can attain a stage of 12,685,200 plenty (4,630,098,000 plenty per year). Proceeding from this, the medical tendencies financed by the RusGas venture might hide 0.065% of the annual gas consumption, that's already fairly a lot.\n\nBut RusAgas has a other purpose: its know-how will elevate the science intensity of the business within the Russian Federation by 5\u20137 times, sharply cutting the hole from global standards.\nPURCHASING AND PERSONAL ACCOUNT\nRegistration and personal account\n     Currently, Rusgas refuses to enforce a full-featured personal cabinet due to the low feasibility of this challenge as opposed to the background of technical issues and the timing of its implementation.\n\nToday, many workplaces in different ico are full of news aimlessly with the help of 80% means and are full of really desired content with the help of consumer means to pure 20%. Profits are a real show in the form of a talent for viewing the complete history of transactions, bonuses, and reference gadgets that may be considered inadequate.\n\nTraditional acquisition procedures are sufficient for RusGas challenge tasks that have recently been implemented in different project masses: a gross revenue web page by addressing contracts in which cash will be transferred. This is an easy and obvious technique that is already dependent on the market.\n\nHere, Rusgas wants to make reservations about the following: when distributing the implementation of crypto currency RusGas, and can register a personal bill for each participant. Thus, it can be an integral part of the created ecosystem.\n\nHowever, the rusgas will deliver the registration activity to its logical conclusion. After this, you can get a confirmation email at registration to include a gross income web page under your login and password.\nDISTRIBUTE ONE HUNDRED RGS FOR REGISTRATION.\nThe method of distribution can also be very simple.\n\nIn the next few days rusgas can send all signers of letters with google forms, where it will be important to enter email information and ERC-20 enclosure addresses.\n\nSo such a letter will come automatically upon confirmation of the postal address.\n\nAfter checking the data - and will send RusGas token to all different wallets.\n\nfacebook : https://web.facebook.com/RusGasOfficial?_rdc=1&_rdr\ntwitter : https://twitter.com/RusGasOfficial\nwebsite : https://rusgas.io/en/\nwhitepaper : https://rusgas.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/RUSGAS-Whitepaper_en.pdf\nbounty thread : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3301479.0",

ExxonMobil and Total share investments in R&D is 1 USD per 1 ton of oil equivalent, and in Russia\u200a\u2014\u200aonly 0.2 USD;\nfrom them 90%\u200a\u2014\u200ain exploration and extraction; the gas-chemical business is\nunderfunded. RusGas depends on Kada-Neftegaz consultations to learn the specifics of the Irkutsk area (as an example): it's now not absolutely gasified, now not very thrilling to Gazprom as a consequence of low home gasoline fees and low consumption.\nBut the neighborhood administration made decisions at the move of\nNovozamyatinskaya and Baikalskaya TPPs from coal to gas and at the construction of municipal gas boilers. In 2012, forecasts for the elevate of gas production and processing within the area took into account the capability purely of the greatest deposits\u200a\u2014\u200aYaraktinsky, Dulisminsky, Kovyktinsky, Chikhansky, Verkhnechonsky. Others have been referred to as \u201cnot otherwise specified\u201d.\n\nBut small gas fields can grow to be a primary point within the advent of a chain for the production of LNG and polymers. RusGas has studied the wants of the area within the gasification of settlements and the calculations of Kada-Neftegaz for the construction of LNG crops (with infrastructure -31- 32 million USD) and methanol plants. They present the splendor of small gas fields found close to roads and chronic networks. In those cases, investing vast quantities in a pipeline is much less green than investing in production. The advised charge of gas is set 70\u201387 USD per 1000 cubic meters. meters of gas, and the charge of methanol roduced from it on FOB phrases is set 400 USD per ton. Ex factory\u200a\u2014\u200a300 USD.\n\nWith sleek technologies, the value of gas uncooked material per 1 ton of methanol is 860 cubic meters. m of gas. From 1 ton of methanol, it's likely to achieve 460 kg of polyolefins\u200a\u2014\u200ahigh-molecular compounds. Polyethylenes and polypropylenes are approx, half of annual intake of plastics in Europe. Technology is improving. Thus, the extension of the chain for processing uncooked material will increase the diploma of its monetization. RusGas and its investors will make investments in technology for all stages, from extraction to polymer production. Initially, the pattern might be implemented in medium-sized enterprises now not via sale, but in substitute for a share of the product (which may be very prospective), and can keep fees from 15 to 25% in extraction, garage and most importantly in production. Token house proprietors will achieve tokenized gas and at the RusGas platform will choose for themselves regardless of even if they ought to elevate the time and efficiency of the return: regardless of even if to promote gas as chronic or to finance one-of-a-kind tiers of processing. By the similar principles, they might be capable to reinvest profits.\n\nEnergy startups within the global have began utilizing blocking technology to sell\nenergy\u2019s surplus to small firms and individuals, but they're much now not up to RusGas\u2019s concentrated at the use of gas in industries. The wants of the municipalities of the area coincide with the abilities of the block chain technology, already examined within the electricity sector by a couple of platforms, incl. WePower: the holder of the token can purchase chronic immediately from the company and promote the surplus to the network.\n\nRusGas plans to make investments virtually the whole quantity of 20% of the team\u2019s share in medical development. As within the initiatives of this elegance there shouldn't be any doubt the achievement of the Soft Cap level, the investments will make at the very least 600 000 USD. Investments of Russian firms in R&D are on usual 0.2 USD per 1 ton of oil equivalent. Formally, 600 000 USD might \"cover\" 3 million plenty of oil equivalent. Gas intake within the oil an identical within the global by 2040 will elevate by 34 million barrels, or 4,637,600 plenty per day and can attain a stage of 12,685,200 plenty (4,630,098,000 plenty per year). Proceeding from this, the medical tendencies financed by the RusGas venture might hide 0.065% of the annual gas consumption, that's already fairly a lot.\n\nBut RusAgas has a other purpose: its know-how will elevate the science intensity of the business within the Russian Federation by 5\u20137 times, sharply cutting the hole from global standards.\nPURCHASING AND PERSONAL ACCOUNT\nRegistration and personal account\n     Currently, Rusgas refuses to enforce a full-featured personal cabinet due to the low feasibility of this challenge as opposed to the background of technical issues and the timing of its implementation.\n\nToday, many workplaces in different ico are full of news aimlessly with the help of 80% means and are full of really desired content with the help of consumer means to pure 20%. Profits are a real show in the form of a talent for viewing the complete history of transactions, bonuses, and reference gadgets that may be considered inadequate.\n\nTraditional acquisition procedures are sufficient for RusGas challenge tasks that have recently been implemented in different project masses: a gross revenue web page by addressing contracts in which cash will be transferred. This is an easy and obvious technique that is already dependent on the market.\n\nHere, Rusgas wants to make reservations about the following: when distributing the implementation of crypto currency RusGas, and can register a personal bill for each participant. Thus, it can be an integral part of the created ecosystem.\n\nHowever, the rusgas will deliver the registration activity to its logical conclusion. After this, you can get a confirmation email at registration to include a gross income web page under your login and password.\nDISTRIBUTE ONE HUNDRED RGS FOR REGISTRATION.\nThe method of distribution can also be very simple.\n\nIn the next few days rusgas can send all signers of letters with google forms, where it will be important to enter email information and ERC-20 enclosure addresses.\n\nSo such a letter will come automatically upon confirmation of the postal address.\n\nAfter checking the data - and will send RusGas token to all different wallets.\n\nfacebook : https://web.facebook.com/RusGasOfficial?_rdc=1&_rdr\ntwitter : https://twitter.com/RusGasOfficial\nwebsite : https://rusgas.io/en/\nwhitepaper : https://rusgas.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/RUSGAS-Whitepaper_en.pdf\nbounty thread : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3301479.0",

            "text": "**Envion: Mining solution that you need**\n\nIs it only me who thinks that the great evolution is about to bring one of the biggest global changes of all time? Well, the talk here is all about the &quot;Blockchain Technology&quot; that has left no stones unturned to bring the biggest and the greatest changes of all time. Blockchain technology changes with every passing day and makes sure to introduce one of the finest innovations with each passing day. One such technology that follows the same policy and aims to bring a change in the energy sector is Envion.\n\n**What is Envion?**\n\nThere is nothing wrong with claiming or wanting to be the best. The same goes for Envion. It also aims to serve a decentralized blockchain network. Well, Envion keeps all the major tactics in mind. It definitely knows how to get hands-on high profits. Envion just doesn&#39;t stop here. It has a wide vision that looks forward to implementing one of the biggest possible crypto mining worlds for the future.\n\nThese crypto mines will be accumulated in shipping containers. Envion just takes the necessary jump and delivers these containers to the exact location where there is energy starvation. Is it the advantage you are looking for? Well, how about the process being friendly enough to trim off the extra cost?\n\nToday, there is a sure need of renewable energy sources all over the globe. Envion is here to the rescue. It ultimately aims to implement electricity at a very minimal cost. Envion also comes forward with unique proposals. In order to benefit the owners of the power-plants as well the smart contractors, Envion looks for mobile &quot;energy sinks&quot;.\n\n**The Working of Envion**\n\nFor starters, Envion will organize and install mining engineers and fix the shipping containers. The most wonderful part is yet to be introduced and that focuses on the words &quot;efficiency&quot;, &quot;availability&quot;, &quot;minimal cost hardware&quot; etc. These words go parallel with scalability and scope as Envion opens these two doors wide open for all the requirements to be met. The shipping containers will be filled up totally with the things that will be needed for the successful conduction of the mining purpose.  Wondering how epic is that? Well, sure is.\n\nSome of the basic important features of the process are:\n\n**Portability \u2013** The shipping containers that are used in the process are very movable. They can be easily transferred from one place to another with the help of the different modes of transportation available. Envion is totally ready with its solution that will help in consumption at any source or point.\n\n**Energy at service \u2013** The solar panels and they&#39;re out of the world dropping cost has been in the headlines for quite a while now. This helps the customers in a lot of ways. Customers will at least have an idea about where to look for during the crisis. The mining units of Envion will extract the benefits out of the local sources that are available there. In this way, they can have access to the cheapest electricity of all time.\n\n  **Maintenance \u2013** The mining platform of Envion is very friendly. Everyone likes being in touch socially, not just you and me. Hence, to take care of the same, Envion launches its decentralized network on the global platform. Well, is it Facebook or WhatsApp that you are wondering about? No. Envion establishes its connection with the help of satellite or through redundant 4G.\n\n**Original Cooling \u2013** Envion shines all the way. The original cooling system that is used is around 40 times more viable than the others. This will allow them to achieve extraordinary efficiency of power and services.\n\n**The Big Plan**\n\nWhen it comes to smartness, Envion makes sure to be on top. The big idea that it aims to implement is for the shipping containers. Envion looks for shipping containers that are cheap and scalable. After that, it sends all these containers to anywhere and in any sector of the world for the proper and open access to the abundant energy that is present.\n\n**The Business Models**\n\nEnvion separates the mining operations into two major business models.\n\n1. **PMO \u2013** Proprietary Mining Operations.\n2. **TPO \u2013** Third Part Operations.\n\nBoth the models have their own agenda and their own set of strategies to look forward to.\n\nUnder PMO, Envion will make sure to produce its own containers and will be completely taking care of the different process associated with it. Envion will be honest in holding up the ownership and doing all the necessary sacrifices for the operation of these containers.\n\nOn the other side, under TPO, envion looks up front to produce and take care of these containers. All the investments in the process are conducted by the third parties. These third parties can be anything like investment funds or utilities.  Eventually, these will turn the tables on their side only.\n\n**The Features of Envion**\n\nHere is an outline of the Envion features.\n\n**The Plug and Play Add-on:** The new startup feature is just a cherry on the top. This aims at providing self-directed and independent mining power in any corner of the globe.\n\n**Free and Flying:** The mobility concept of Envion is just another brilliant feature to look forward to. It enables a simplified and trouble-free transportation process all across the world.\n\n**Scalability:** This is ensured with the help of mobile phones and by keeping in mind the low cost.\n\n**The Envion Token Sale**\n\nThe pre-sale of Envion has already begun from 1st December 2017. However, the general dates for the ICO have been scheduled from 3rd December 2017 to 31st December 2017.\n\nThe investment that will be made in the first year is around $50,000. Thinking about the profit? The profit that it aims to achieve is $80,500. The envion platform will use the EVN tokens. The total number of tokens to be supplied is 150 million.\n\nThe advantage that comes for the token holders includes their direct access to 75% of the earnings. The rest 25% will be kept for the future.\n\nOne EVN token will be priced at $0.70 to $1 USD. This price is for the pre-sale only, which may marginally increase by the end of December.\n\nHere is how the division goes for the 150 million tokens.\n\n- Token holders \u2013 83%\n- Founders \u2013 10%\n- Bounties \u2013 2%\n- Envion AG \u2013 5%\n\n**The Final Words**\n\nIf it is my opinion that you are looking for, I would stand up front talking whole day long about this Envion. This is yet another most &quot;looked forward&quot; project for one to be a part of. The project deals with one of the major aspects of the world and that is _Energy._ Well, the ray of hopes tells us that the issue will soon be wiped off by Envion.\n\n**Website** : https://envion.org/en/\n\n**Whitepaper** : https://envion.org/en/download/envion\\_whitepaper.pdf\n\n**Writer&#39;s Btalk Profile:** https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1027561",

            "text": "LOCI hosted an AMA on December 18th between 10am and 1pm EST. The session was great and there were three hours filled with interesting questions and very good answers. We present to you the top 10 questions and answers of the AMA. If you want to see all the AMA please visit https://www.reddit.com/r/loci_io/. \n\n1.I understand that you can use LOCI coins to pay for a monthly subscription to use InnVenn. What will happen with those tokens?\n\nTokens paid to Loci for subscription or for blockchain posting will end up in the pool of tokens that we use for IP purchasing/exchanging and airdrops to users according to our economic model as we detail in the whitepaper and in a recent medium post by John.\n\n2.How much experience does the LOCI team has in the field of patenting?\n\nMy father and I filed our first patent for Loci in 2011. It was 897 pages with more than 400 claims. Since then we have filed many more. I believe around 4 but with several divisionals and continuations. In addition, I have worked on more than 10,000 inventions during my time in engineering, and have had more than 1,500 personally.\n\nNOTE: The answer was given by John Wise, Loci Founder & CEO.\n\n3.What strategy do you have in order to prevent a drop in value after the ICO?\n\nLoci is not and will never be in the business of speculating on the price of the tokens.\n\n4.What will happen with your unsold tokens?\n\nUnsold tokens will be locked up for a 4 year vesting period. 25% available every year for the purpose of supporting the growth of the Loci ecosystem.\n\n5.How fast can patenting get using your app?\n\nOur platform can help streamline the process before getting a patent filed as the search tool can help the inventor understand how their idea uniquely fits in the IP landscape while recording the relevant prior art. All of this information can be taken to the inventor's patent agent/attorney for filing. The patent filing process itself is not within our control as we are not a patent office. The time to get the patent filed and approved will go through the same expected time range which is usually in the 3-5 year range.\n\n6.If you want to buy something from InnVenn are you obliged to use Loci tokens? \n\nThere are 3 main uses for LOCIcoin right now in InnVenn. The subscription access (100 LOCIcoin per month), blockchain posting (1 LOCIcoin per event) and bidding on an idea or patent. \n\n7.How are you going to be in touch with the community after the ICO is over?\n\nThis is very important to us, because its not just the crypto community, but its the inventor community that matters to us. Our tool and mission is about unlocking innovation around the world and bringing transparency and openness to the process.\nAs a specific answer, we plan on hiring staff to manage the community outreach and communication directly. Medium and Telegram will be our main efforts for that.\n\n8.What amount of tokens is the foundation going to hold and how will they be used?\n\nThe foundation will hold 34% of the total supply of the tokens. The primary purpose of the foundation is for the buying and selling of ideas to keep the network economy flowing. \nAs the volume of transactions grow and there becomes a surplus, excess tokens held by the foundation will be airdropped toplatform  users. Refer here: https://medium.com/@John_Loci/understanding-locicoin-economics-be46d87f0f86 to learn more about Loci's Economic model.\n\n9.Why is posting your idea on the blockchain effectively a patent? How does that part work?\n\nPutting ideas on the blockchain does NOT create a patent. That is very important, only the government can issue patents. What we are doing is putting proof of a disclosure on the blockchain. That disclosure event gives the idea creator a 12-month period where they are exclusively able to patent the idea. Our system is designed to work in tandem with the PTO processes.\n\n10 How are you going to attract people to use your product?\n\nWe will continue to do our marketing to reach the IP professional and inventor communities. The token sale has been great in growing awareness and early adoption from the crypto community. We are always working on strategic partnerships to build synergies between different user bases.\n",

            "text": "Hi everyone. I have made a very basic list to spot SCAM ICOs. Its sad that so many people end up investing in totally SCAM ICOs. Please give your valuable comments to improve the list, points to be added/removed. \n\nHow to spot SCAM ICOs\n\nNow, I won't claim to be an ICO investment expert. But there are some basic things which I have learned in the last couple of months. And I don't find a proper documentation regarding those basic do\u2019s and don\u2019ts.\n\nSo here is a very basic list which I think everyone entering in crypto space should first go through to get acquainted to catch some of the obvious SCAMs in crypto space.\n\n1. The three things to notice into an ICO in your first glance are Team, token economics and product. Now imagine you are a venture capitalist, and someone comes up to you with a business idea (like in Shark Tank). What would you look for before investing? Apply those same basic fundamentals here also. Don't be in a hurry that ICOs are getting over and all ICOs will give you huge profits. Most of them are SCAMs with incompetent teams claiming to solve big problems.\n\n2. If an ICO is throwing a huge amount of coins in airdrops, most probably its a SCAM. If you want to spend your time for those airdrops you can, but I would suggest you not to as those coins are useless and worthless.\n\n3. Check every team member\u2019s LinkedIn page. If they dont have on then most probably its a SCAM. Check if they have accomplished something really good before this ICO or not. Making a successful business is not that easy and on a single idea, they are 10's of ICOs happening right now.\n\n4. Then check their GitHub page. This is where they put their open source code. Even if you are not a developer do check this out and it's not that difficult to spot the diff between an empty GitHub page and the one with a lot of code and a lot of activity. Check how often code is submitted there.\n\n5. Join their telegram and ask questions regarding their business plans and not \u2018when moon\u2019 questions. If you find everyone in the telegram asking moon questions understand that those people are not checking the real stuff which needs to be checked so you gotta check it out yourself. SCAM ICOs usually throw you out of the telegram page if you ask genuine questions.\n\n6. Over telegram, admin will never ping you personally and help you in investing in that ICO. So if someone or anyone pings you directly over the telegram, that\u2019s a scammer. Report him and block him. I usually act along with their scam trick and frustrate them before blocking them, its fun sometimes :)\n\n7. Over Tweeter you will find tweets like this: \u2018Send me 0.1 Eth and I will send you can 10 Eth. They are scammers. NO ONE will ever send you back more Eth if you send them Eth first.\n\n8. You can check the ICO reviews over sites like ICObench, ICO drops but most of them paid and shilled. So better not trust them blindly. ICObench is really crappy and totally paid.\n\n9. Invest only if you understand what problem the ICO is solving, else it will be difficult for you to HODL your tokens when the market dips. So invest in the tech, not in the dream of Lambo.\n\n10. People over Reddit, medium are many times shilling, so don't trust them blindly. But Reddit is a good place than any of the other sites. Also, check ICOs discord channel. Really good ICOs have it so that the dev teams can discuss work there. Bogus ICOs usually don't have it.\n\n11. Read the Whitepaper. If you cant understand the whole thing, atleast try to understand what is the point of having a token. The token must have a utility.\n\nRemember this that most ICOs are SCAM. Be diligent and don't lose all your money in such scams.",

Here's my not so simple answer:**\n\n*Bitcointalk is not optional; it's required. So is Telegram.*\n\n*To be honest anywhere people are talking about Crypto, you should have a presence (except 4chan IMO ~ no offense intended). The thing is people will expect it, and anytime your company is/could be discussed you want/need to be a part of (and help guide) the conversation.*\n\n*Facebook groups will commonly be run by gatekeepers and they probably will want cash money upfront to reach their audience. That should be a few hundred to a few thousand depending. If you're going to pay, make sure that it pencils out and see if you can work out a deal (maybe for some of your tokens). You can negotiate, but do not piss those people off.*\n\n*Now, an entirely other issue are the ICO listing/ratings sites. Watch out for those guys because, some but not all, can be essentially an extortion racket. I'm not kidding. They will charge you monthly, and if you don't pay, they might just give you a bad rating. They'll commonly make you pay for KYC too.*\n\n*Worst of all, I've seen ratings they give being directly tied to how much you pay them. No joke; (as a made up example) you get their \"Diamond\" or \"Emerald\" rating, depending on if you pay for their \"Diamond\" or \"Emerald\" advertising package. They literally call it the same thing. It's criminal IMO.*\n\n*There are all sorts of YouTube \"gurus\" too that will \"interview\" you for a fee.*\n\n*Stay far away from all of these folks. If they reach out to you be very careful. Some of them are obviously disreputable to people that matter, but will have a huge following of people that don't know any better. Anyone talking about making their followers rich is definitely not going to.*\n\n*Grass roots support is what will win the day. Pay-to-play is best avoided wherever possible. Tons of people will reach out to you, and try to sell you the world (aka promise you the moon; heh). You don't have to respond, but do your homework on them before you do.*\n\n*Always ask questions, but be polite. Whatever you do, never ever piss them off. If you're polite, they will probably leave you alone. If they attack you for no good reason, ignore them until it becomes a significant problem. Then ask them to stop and correct them nicely (and in private), but avoid a fight and never pay them to stop. If you do pay them, they'll just demand more. That's extortion 101.*\n\n\n**In that response I was being a little bombastic and a bit over-generalized, but IMHO, it's directionally true. Anyway, thanks for reading and please tell me what you think in the comments below.**",

            "text": "REMME (Amazing Product....but who cares for that)\n\nNo more passwords needed, no way for a potential hacker to access your private accounts and if you forget your password no worries, REMME gets rid of almost every issue there is when it comes to passwords. The REMME product is obviously amazing and a truly needed edition to our lives, their team are transparent with answering questions on their telegram and they won multiple awards including Microsoft's Hackathon in 2017. That's right, MICORSOFT's Hackathon. REMME have some serious tech geeks on their team!!!\n\nBut does any of this really matter? Being in \"the wild-west\" stage of crypto makes a decent product with a genuine team somewhat redundant to how the coin/token performs, at least for the short to medium term. When it comes to ICO's the ones that performed the best in 2017 were the ones that did the least actual work. They didn't even have a working product. If you don't believe me read this article from Bloomberg: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-12/want-to-issue-a-red-hot-ico-rule-no-1-is-do-very-little-work\n\nWhat really matters when it comes to performance of an ICO after it begins to trade is mainly down to \"hype\". In the world of crypto the ones that stand out now are the ones that shout the loudest about price. \"100 x for this ICO guaranteed\" is common from individuals with a mass of subscribers that truly believe what they say. Who wouldn't want 100x instantly? Do people really fall for this stuff? It would seem so, so much so that prominent youtubers, bloggers e.t.c. are being hired as \"advisors\" to teams to help promote their upcoming ICO. These bloggers \"unbiased\" opinions don't stay very unbiased for long. On a side note, please always read the white paper as well as conducting a lot of research before investing any of your money into ICOs. Ask yourself, how many people do you know that invest in ICOs actually read the white paper fully? Their short 3-minute cartoon video is usually enough to seal the deal. When marketing is done correctly before an ICO the ICO fills up within a tiny amount of time, toss in some post public offering hype, price starts to rise above ICO price and people start chasing the dragon bringing on FOMO which is bolstered by whales and ended even faster by them too. \n\nDoes REMME have this effect or is it going to stagnate and dump after it is released on an exchange? \nShort answer is............No..... let's delve into why.\n\nThe ICOs that dump the hardest soon after they are trading on an exchange are ones that had huge bonuses for their early investors such as seed investors, private and public pre-sales. 50-300% extra tokens for early investors with no lock-up on much of it is asking for a dump, but even with this greed takes over and there will be that initial pump by the unscrupulous to really reap every penny from the impatient. \n\nThis won't happen to REMME. The reasons I believe are simple. Every individual that bought REMME during the ICO got 10% free tokens and then the pre-sale investors got 20%. No 50% bonus? that is preposterous!! All pre-sales had a total of 3 million dollars and the public offering was 17 million dollars. The difference here between 10 to 20% is marginal especially in crypto terms . The team and founders get 20% of all tokens however there is a 2 year vesting period with a 6 months cliff so this has no effect for a long time. Partners and advisers also have 20% of the tokens and 10% of tokens will have 6 months vesting with 3 months cliff. Advisers have the biggest weight at the earliest point when it comes to selling potential on an exchange however it is not a crazy amount. There was a cap for every individual that invested in the ICO of 15 eth for the first 24 hours and only a small amount of eth was left over for investors to get much more than this. The largest account is less than 150 eth which is not much in terms of the entirety of REMME. This is one of the most decentralized ICOs that I have come across. This is one of the main reasons why REMME is at the very least robust against a dump. Everyone knows that a small market cap is easy to move. REMME has a tiny marketcap of only 20 million dollars. If you did want to dump REMME you would want to dump it at its highest possible value. Everyone that wants to flip REMME wants to get the biggest bang for their buck. A 10x move for REMME is big but not crazy. It is much easier to move a tiny marketcap like REMME's instead of something that begins life at 200 million marketcap. Moral or not, flippers of REMME know that tiny marketcaps are easy to move, so a conservative 6x to 8x (0.24 to 0.32 dollars\uff09within the first 3 days is not crazy by any measure. \n\nREMME hype: \nREMME has a lot of hype from youtubers like the crypto lark as well as AltcoinBuzz, to one more that may be its biggest ace up its sleeve when it comes to creating FOMO. \nREMME had 2 separate days of registration for their ICO. The first day was only for those that were following them on Telegram. The second was for everyone else in the world. REMME cancelled their second day registration due to the amount of people that signed up through their telegram. 17k people signed up for the ICO in one day. What many of these people then failed to realize was that they then had to fill out a form later on to include their ether address in which they would be using during ICO amongst other details. This had to be completed within a short period of time that was well in advance of the ICO. Less than 10 thousand individuals actually remembered to complete this step before the ICO. REMME broadcast this everywhere on telegram, to e-mailing everyone however, simple laziness halted many from being able to contribute. These people desperately want to buy REMME as could be seen just before and just after the finish of their ICO on their telegram group. FOMO in crypto is huge, but none more so than FOMO of ICO's and the 'pain' of missing an ICO that you have been following is wrenching, we have all been there. \nThis unexpected event will likely cause a surge of buy orders for REMME as soon as it hits an exchange.\n\nWith all factors combined from how decentralized the tokens are, low easy to move marketcap, hype, mass of people that missed out that want in and how great the product and team are, this leads me to believe that  REMME will do between a 6x to potentially 8x return from ICO price before diving and settling down around the 3.5 to 4x ICO price. \n\nI would love to hear any feedback both positive and negative so let me know what you guys think.\n\n\n",

We've received quite a bit of passionate feedback, and for the most part (sans one criticism) it's all been very positive. However, we've been told that, because we used pseudonyms and stock photos for our team profiles, that we must be a scam. Actually, it's quite the opposite. Somewhat ironically, I sold an anonymous tech app before turning 23, and co-founded two others (both are succeeding, one is very controversial). I've experienced first hand backlash when people don't agree with your business ideas, regardless of how innovative and successful they are. I've had to defend my companies and their intent during dozens of interviews, and on several major news stations. I've been contacted by pastors who told me I was evil, and been rejected by friends and family. All of this for ideas that are far, far less controversial than Fantasy Market. So, if you can, try to empathize with our rationale for staying anonymous. We're not exactly making a some happy-go-lucky, feel good, save humanity from global warming blockchain solution \u2026 nope, we're making a cam-girl site where you can control the performer with our tokens. It's equal parts incredible and career suicide.\n\nYour feedback has given me hope that FM will be embraced. Hopefully, that's true, and your sentiment is representative of the broader crypto community. Just know this: two of my team members are married, and the other is engaged. At 25, I'm the youngest, and also the only one who isn't tied down. For that reason, they'll still remain anonymous until the token sale is successful.\n\nI'm going to do an AMA tomorrow at 12pm EST, where I'll detail my past and verifiable real world successes starting and selling controversial companies. I'll address your questions and concerns, and hopefully quell any remaining doubt about the legitimacy of my team, and more importantly, Fantasy Market. I've been down this high profile, controversial path before, and know what I'm getting into.\n\nFor those of you who have already invested, if after tomorrow you're still not convinced, we will return your investments. If you have any other questions, shoot me an email at: hello@fantasymarket.com. Hope you all can make it.",

I think I was one of the first people to find out about them & I did a lot of research around them.  \n\nI had a 30 minute conversation (through facebook) with one of their staff members asking a ton of questions, and they were able to answer everything.\n\nI am looking at them as a buy and hold.  I have been heavily invested in Canadian REITs over the last two years on the TSX and got great returns.  I have also flipped a couple properties myself and under the right direction I can see the value of the BMT portfolio steadily growing at 20-50% a year. \n\nI like how they are doing a combination of expansion and payout.  It lets the value of tokens keep going up while adding to income.  \n\nOne of the big things I like about this is that it will be a closed token, so no more can be issued.  One thing I hate about REITs & some crypto tokens is when they release new stocks/tokens that devalue everyone.   Since they are closed, and are buying back & destroying tokens it puts a ton of upward pressure on the tokens. ",

It has diversification options with ETCF\u2019s. \n* and last but not the least, to launch a system to create custom tokens in a few clicks.\n\nI appreciate any feedback, good or bad.

And yet it's gone up over a hundred times in value very quick.. and after examining the project further it's obvious why.. the tech is fantastic. The team is fantastic. The academic backing is fantastic. \n\nHow did the entire western crypto community miss this one? I realize it was in Japan.. but still. My question is.. where can I find these obscure upcoming ICOs in future? The project is obviously great, I'm surprised everyone missed this one. Is there a secret community somewhere with those of us who are switched on, and on the look-out for things like this? Preferably one where we've experienced the usual ERC-20 token being dumped on after the ICO.. one where we all have a keen eye and experience, one with no shilling, one that finds these obscure ICOs. \n\nIt's better everyone is active but only posts a message once a month or so.. you know.. we don't need daily speculation.. but just the occasional good tip to make great bank with.\n\nEDIT: Appreciate the responses, some were helpful. But a lot were shilling useless crap. And none linked to a site that can list these obscure projects. \n\nI've also found no Discord, Telegram or other group that hunts out these obscure projects. Why dont' we create our own one? Anyone with me? We can hire people in different countries to join crypto communities, academic groups etc to find out about these hidden gems.",

The project presumes and additional way of cryptocurrency generation and that is what all the current players are looking for. Accordingly, the project is worth while paying attention to, as it is not just a new coin, but an ICO based on the final project, already existing for 10 years.

This opinion isn't a financial or investment advice.\n\n***About our method:***\n\nInterest Level shows ICOs which should be looked at first. We analyze only conditions and parameters of the token sale, only items which can influence in the short term. \n\n***Hype rate***\n\nAirSwap has \u00abHigh Level\u00bb of Hype rate. Initially, many people saw it as a project \u00abby Consensys\u00bb. Traffic on all resources is true. It\u2019s one of the few projects wich has completely reliable traffic without bots (and paid followers, retweets etc.). Telegram - 2.8k chat + 5k announcement channel, it\u2019s really huge. \n\n***Risk rate***\n\nAirSwap risk rate is \u00abNormal\u00bb. \n\n* May be it\u2019s low, but they sold $20m during the presale with discount (10-30%). It means if bad news about crypto appear, the price can fall by 10-30% (just guys from the presale will fix profit). \n* A lot of people have registered in Whitelist and it\u2019s positive item. \n* ICO need to collect 12m$ (42k ETH) only. It means there will be a rapid Token Sale and latecomers will have to buy on exchanges.\n\n***ROI rate***\n\nAirSwap has \u00abHigh\u00bb ROI rate on ICO Drops. Just look to other \u00abTrading\u00bb ICOs - 0x, KyberNetwork. All similar projects have showed a very great profit (x2-x5) at a short distance.\n\nThat's why we concluded that \u00abAirSwap\u00bb is \u00abHigh Interest Level\u00bb. \n\nMore about AirSwap - https://icodrops.com/airswap/",

It is very easy for us to access the information through the Internet and we are able to pursue the developments in the world where we live. Every field and every sector now uses technology and the blessings it brings to the end. Let's think of a business. From raw material procurement to production process, from design to marketing, from sales to customer services, even from public relations to data collection and analysis phase, they use technology every step of the way. Especially with the new generation of block-chain technology and the crypto-money that comes along with the bring-ups, all sectors are undergoing another change and development.\n\n\u23fa\ufe0fIt is possible to use the block chain immediately in all the steps I have mentioned above, and now the projects that exploit and exploit many chain of blockbusters are outdated. Because the block chain makes it easier for both us and the companies to do business and transactions. The most important reasons for being kept here are that it is not fast, cheap, reliable, central and does not need intermediaries. Discovering this, the 4th Pillar approach is also a new ecosystem designed to participate in many applications of block-chain technology, serving individuals, recruitment and organizations. Here, companies will also be able to use this platform to raise financial capacities, present business documents, and recruit as human resources.\n\nhttps://www.the4thpillar.io",

They share some strategy how to reach the successful of the project after ICO finish. Even this is presenting Project after ICO, but this is an important thing to be known and understood before decide to join the ICO. Here below some of the strategy:\n\n1. After the ICO, DWB team intend to incentivize sugar daddies and babies to migrate into DWB blockchain platform. The most desirable sugar babies and most active sugar daddies will receive free tokens when they verify their accounts into the blockchain. If Sugar daddies want to rank higher in searches then they will have to deposit more capital into their BENEFIT wallet. Through this process the demand for BENEFIT will grow, and the price will grow with it. We know that users are already very active in the sugar dating niche. We are merely offering these users increased safety, security and efficiency.\n2. Dating With Benefits is an ICO designed to bring new capital into the crypto market. This is money that\u2019s usually spent on websites that these users currently date on, or through gifts given to users on these websites. What DWB will do is migrate their spendings, and holdings into our eco system. Not only the money they would gift to their dates and subscription fees that are normally paid, but also extra capital as an assurance for the sugar baby that the sugar daddy is as wealthy as he says he is.\n3. DWB plan to incentivize 200,000 sugar daddies in the first year after launch to migrate onto our blockchain platform. Industry data estimates that the average sugar daddy will keep at least $5000 in BENEFIT in his account. That is about as much as the average sugar daddy currently spends on a sugar baby every month. If this estimation is correct, it would mean the market cap of BENEFIT would be $1,000,000,000 after the first year of launching.\n\nThree points above seems to be reach the successful as targeted by the DWB team. If there is some opinion, please to share.",

I intend to improve the document in a couple different ways. First, by analyzing the ratings relative to their source. Sure, a 5/5 is nice, but how common is that rating for that specific reviewer? How special is it if 50% of his reviews get that rating?\n\nSecondly, I want to find out who the most reliable reviewers are and add a trust rating to my spreadsheet. Some of you mentioned concerns regarding the quality some reviews out there. That's definitely a valid point. Review quality is important and will become even more so as the market expands. I think a good way to determine a reviewer's trust rating might be to analyze ICO ratings per reviewer and compare them to ICO ROI. I'll be working on that, but it will take a while.\n\nRegards.",

            "text": "Thousands of blockchain-based startups dream about launching an ICO. But just having a project idea without the thinking about the marketing strategy and budget will doom many launches before they even get started.\n\n\nPhoto by William Iven on Unsplash\nStartups face an uphill battle to get noticed in a space where hundreds of ICOs run at the same time. So getting some solid advice from someone who has spent time in the marketing trenches is critical.\n\nMarina Baslina from CrowdCoinage here. Today I\u2019m going to share my insights about ICO marketing. I have over 6 years of experience working with international startups, but I\u2019ve found ICO marketing is a different animal altogether. There are many aspects to marketing an ICO that you\u2019d never have to consider in a conventional marketing campaign.\n\nBelow are my top 5 tips for anyone considering launching an ICO.\n\nDon\u2019t try to make money, try to be useful to the crypto/blockchain community. If the community doesn\u2019t get behind you, you\u2019ll struggle to succeed. You need to form strategic alliances and get supporters behind you in order to create a successful ICO.\nThere must be at least one blockchain expert in the team. Sometimes you get too close to your own project to be able to look at it objectively from an investors\u2019 point-of-view. For example, one potential investor told me that he didn\u2019t like the idea of e-Residency because blockchain is about being anonymous, so he didn\u2019t care about the KYC. For example at CrowdCoinage we incorporate Estonian e-Residency into their platform to provide investors with verifiable identification about key players in projects they are considering investing in.\nMake sure you join a promising project with the idea that it really is based on blockchain technology and makes blockchain available to the masses. The biggest issue is that people concentrate on making money, and not on the bringing value to the community. This may work for short-term gains, but in the long-run you\u2019ll spend a lot of money creating an ICO. So why not create something sustainable and exciting that people will invest in long-term?\nICO marketing is a completely different thing than other marketing projects.\nAt first I thought it\u2019ll be easy based on my experience in IT startup world. But it\u2019s more complicated. If you don\u2019t have a working product and you rely only on the ideas, you have to make sure the idea is ground breaking.\n\nBecause \u201csmall\u201d token buyers who invest $300 on average are planning to sell the token when ICO ends. That\u2019s why they care about your arrangements with exchange, and about whether your team is real. They don\u2019t really care about the project future compared to large investors.\n\nThat\u2019s why you should start with private sales, with a pool of large investors, that will close your hard cap for pre-ICO, this way it\u2019ll be easier to communicate with small investors on the next stage.\n\n5. Creating an ICO is very similar to classic startup funding. If you want to get millions from private investors you have to present your idea on conference calls, do the roadshow, and create a whitepaper (which is in some ways similar to creating a business plan.) So the whole process is about the idea, the team and you passion. It won\u2019t work if the project founder is not pushing it forward.\n\nThere you have it.\n\nThere are many more moving parts to an ICO than you might think. So make sure that you have the budget, the strategy and the right experts on your team before you even consider an ICO. Having an idea to create a blockchain-based project isn\u2019t enough on its own to attract the kind of attention you need.",

We can see FOMO in crypto everywhere and it also applies during bear markets - nobody wants to to lose money and if they think something will go down further, they'll naturally bail in the hope they can buy in for lower later on or give themselves the choice to. It's a snowball effect. And the irony is posts and comments like the one you've been banned for all contribute to this hive mind mentality that something is wrong / project is doomed because the price keeps going down. It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy which we see time and time again.\n\nIf you've been in crypto long enough, you'll see these cycles repeat over and over...",

They are beating their chests about wanting to sell 10 million tokens to pay dividends to token holders from annual profits made by Binary.com. Binary.com is openly paying their affiliates on clients losing. This is known as their \"revenue share\" model for affiliates. \nPROOF: https://www.financemagnates.com/binary-options/brokers/exclusive-binary-com-ico-shows-company-profits-surpass-20-mln-2017/\n\nWhat is VERY VERY worrying is that www.forexpeacearmy.com that is a known bastion of hope for traders who get scammed and who actively is helping them recover money was THREATENED BY THE CEO OF BINARY.COM JEAN-YVES SIREAU to remove all negative posts or else they will pursue legal action.

Any negative reviews that do appear the company threatens to sue people. This one seems worse than STOX who stole 30 million dollars from investors. These brokers need to go they simply have no place here. Fraudsters.\n\nI am in their SLACK channel and it is run by their marketing person KAREN YAP who is a conman and openly is scamming clients with promotions to affiliates. I have also heard of instances where profitable services that connected to their API were shut down last year but I need more proof behind this.\n\nI would be very careful of this company.",

Understandably, it is in our nature to get excited and overestimate the short term impact of technology. By contrast, 2018 was a year of correction, reckoning, and cleansing. By the end of the year, many supposed crypto funds were but one step from insolvency, with dozens of the once-promising crypto projects nearly bankrupt.\n\nWhile nearly everyone got burned with the correction,\u201deasy money\u201d has practically evaporated. The market has not only cleansed the landscape, but has also pushed back on the immediate visions of our future.\n\nStill, it is precisely when most people lose hope, stumble and falter, that the greatest opportunities arise. The night is darkest before dawn. But the dawn is coming.\n\n#### To grow fast you need time to build a foundation\n\nElrond began at the end of 2017 fueled by a passion to solve what we thought were the most pressing problems in the space: scalability, efficiency, and interoperability.\n\nThe vision we set out with, was that Elrond should be a value transfer protocol. One that can scale, is fast, and comparatively efficient. As we progressed, it became clear to us, that the digital economy consisted of two important parts: programmable money, and unstoppable applications. And Elrond could do both, because unlike previous blockchain iterations, it does not have to trade-off performance, for security and decentralization.\n\nOur vision evolved, as we did. And finally, it crystalized into the platform enabling anyone, anywhere, to access the digital economy.\n\nWe understood we could only fulfil this vision, by considerably lowering current friction. Friction mounted by weak relative performance in speed and throughput, uncompetitive costs and awful user experience.\n\n#### Dual-flanked attack\n\nThroughout 2018 our focus has been on two important things:\n\n1. Gather a strong technical team and enhance our capability of transforming vision into a working product.\n2. Discover new technical frontiers and solving hard sharding and consensus problems.\n\nFor the first part, we have come to a point where we feel we have one of the most experienced and resourceful teams in the space. It took time to build, but the results are starting to show.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFull article about elrondnetwork in:  [https://medium.com/elrondnetwork/vision-roadmap-milestones-bde4542a3047](https://medium.com/elrondnetwork/vision-roadmap-milestones-bde4542a3047) ",

            "text": "Ok folks, I need some advice here. Something about this ICO just doesn't seem right & I was hoping to get your collective intelligence/opinion on it. \n\nI have abstracted or amended details & will not provide the ICO name as I do not want to be spreading rumours in case I am wrong (hopefully I am).\n\n1. ICO is for a company that will be bringing a new mobile payment/POS/ticketing/crypto wallet/trade marketplace to market\n\n2. Company has the usual online presence - website, social media, whitepaper. Description of the technology is fairly vague. Technology itself is still in development with a 2018 launch date (according to the whitepaper).\n\nHere's the main bit:\n\n3. Company started a pre-ICO with 80m tokens ERC20 tokens issued. 40m tokens retained by the company, 40m available to the public via pre-ICO & ICO.\n\n4. Tracking the token on ethplorer and similar sites indicates an initial supply of 40m, which is then drawn down via small, irregular investments/purchases.\n\n5. After running the pre-ICO for about a month, the company announces that they have sold 5m tokens to a range of investors from many different countries.\n\n6. I immediately thought it was strange given the numbers I saw on ethplorer were barely about 100k tokens sold. So I checked again and surely enough - around 200k tokens were allocated (based on a remaining supply of 39.8m tokens)\n\n7. So I spoke to the management team for the company & ICO. They told me that it's true that they sold only about 200k tokens for crypto (ETH) and the rest of the tokens were sold for fiat/cash \n\n8. When I questioned this further, it turns out that many investors (actually majority of investors - their numbers imply they have well over 5,000 individual investors in the pre-ICO alone and only about 40 invested using crypto) wanted to invest in the project but did not know how to use MyEtherWallet, use crypto, etc. So they just gave this company fiat (via credit card or direct bank payments) in exchange for a certificate of ownership of tokens   \n\n9. Furthermore, it turns out that the tokens will be allocated to all ICO participants (who invested using fiat) AFTER the ICO closes using manual transfers (to around 5,000 people) from the company's wallet. \n\n10. When I asked why can't the manual allocation be done now rather than @ the end of ICO, I was told that the tokens are in lockup and can't be released from the company's wallet until the ICO finishes due to the smart contract/programming of the ICO. \n\nI'm no crypto expert but this seems ridiculous to me. Based on their pre-ICO prices, their claims of 5m token sales must've raised around $500k to 5,000 investors around the world with the vast majority of these investors getting nothing in exchange for their money other than a certificate of ownership & a promise for tokens in about 2 months time (once ICO finishes).\n\nSo my questions to your collective wisdom:\n\n1. Is the above normal practice for ICOs?\n\n2. Is this likely a fraud or a scam or just the company inflating their pre-ICO results to make themselves sound more successful and more reputable for the ICO itself to drive more investment?\n\n3. If this is a fake/fraud/scam, what questions should I ask or what information should I request from the management team to determine or prove this beyond doubt?\n\nAs I said - I really hope this is normal practice in ICOs and that I'm wrong.\n\nTIA",

            "text": "Hello Everybody,\n\nOur company is World Crypto Lotto, we're going to provide a blockchain lottery, with a better odds of winning, and a higher portion of revenue provided to winners than any traditional lottery out there. \n\nWe're about to launch an ICO, we're also going to be providing a lifelong bonus draw to our Early Investors, we just want to know what people want before we decide how to structure the prize pool.\n\nThe prize pool will consist of 2.5% of Gross Revenue. \n\n**The questions are:**\n\n**1. Would you prefer option a), b), c) or d) below?**\n\n**2. Do you have any suggestions on a better way to divy up the prize pool (we don't want to divide it equally between every investor because this would be classified as an equity and we'd fall under IPO regulations) and if so, what are they?**\n\n**3. Which wallet address would you like to receive your tokens into?**\n\nFor every completed survey, we're willing to pay 200 tokens, we'll be selling our tokens for $.50 USD each, so this is about $100 USD worth.\n\nOption A - We Assign 1.5% revenue to a weekly prize draw, selecting 150 wallets at random per week, or 7800 per annum. Your probability of winning depends on the investment, for $1,000 invested, you have a probability of winning at least once per year >95%, if we sell out of tickets to our weekly lottery draw each week, this is at least $1,000 per anum. We then assign 1% to a quarterly draw, which selects one winner, probability of winning at least once for $1,000 investment = .16% per anum, for a possible winning of $1,200,000 US\n\nOption B - We assign the same amounts as option A, however we only select 15 winners in the weekly draw, or 780 per annum. Probability of winning the weekly draw for $1,000 invested becomes 27%, for an amount of $10,000+ per anum if we sell out of tickets.\n\nOption C - We scrap the quarterly draw, and select 250 winners per weekly draw, or 13,000 per annum, probability of winning at least once per $1,000 per anum invested >99%, expected payout per win if we sell all tickets = $1,000\n\nOption D - Scrap the draws entirely and offer free tickets into the lottery instead, say $500 worth of free tickets per $100 invested during Early Bird stage.\n\n**To summarize - assuming tickets into the weekly lottery draw sell out each week:**\n\nOption a) 95% chance of winning $1,000 USD +, .16% chance of winning $1,200,000 USD - per annum \n\nOption b) 27% chance of winning $10,000 USD+, .16% chance of winning $1,200,000 USD - per annum\n\nOption c) 99% chance of winning $1,000 USD+ per annum\n\nOption d) Free tickets into standard draws\n\nPlease post replies on this forum, any up votes would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTo avoid double participation, we're only accepting responses from users that had an account before this post, and /post history.\n\nWebsite: https://worldcryptolotto.online/\n\nThanks, \n\nDaniel\n",

            "text": "A few days ago I posted a basic explanation of the idea behind COEVAL, the embryonic token released by Monkey Capital less than a month ago, and its relationship to MNY, the token at the center of their upcoming ICO.  \n\nSince that post the price of COEVAL has risen sharply, thumbing its nose at the downturn that plagued almost every other cryptocurrency on the market, so I thought I would give it another go and see if I can clearly document how I understand what the Monkey white and yellow papers tell us about how they plan to operate so as to generate returns for token holders post-ICO.\n\nFirst we have to admit it: ICOs are fun!  They are full of passion and excitement; generating strong opinions and equally strong words to express them. Organizers and participants alike gnaw their nails in anticipation for launch and then voyeuristically watch the millions build up on the ubiquitous javascript counter.  Finally, at the conclusion, the demands for available markets and accusations of who is or is not a flipper usually begin to fly before the champagne cork hits the floor.\n\nAs volume increases and price stabilizes to slightly above ICO, a refractory period begins in the mind of the average investor.  They begin to review why they bought a token to help fund this particular \u201cworld\u2019s first completely decentralized and autonomous peer-to-peer widget network that runs completely on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nWas it inherent value within the system that they are bringing to market?  \n\nWas it pure speculation that the price would immediately fly into the Stratis-sphere?  \n\nWas it that they thought the ICO was going to sell out and they simply felt they would be left behind? \n\nI have invested in ICOs for every one of these reasons.  However, when it was over, I was left thinking  \u201cUhh..  my reasons seemed clear when the ICO was plastered all over the discussion boards but now it\u2019s gone and there are four new ones coming out next week\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Monkey Capital team, including CEO Daniel Harrison, seem to be very aware of this diluted long term value of tokens and have dedicated a lot of brainpower to overcoming it with something they have termed a \u201cDynamic Value Model.\u201d  This is a straightforward name for a bundle of not-so-straightforward concepts.  I will reiterate my previous caveat that I will not be able to cover the entire concept fairly; I am only attempting to explain the broad strokes. They have updated their white paper and added a yellow paper, both located on their website which will go much farther in-depth.  Bring a dictionary.\n\nIn line with the embryo concept of COEVAL the Dynamic Value Model follows a family structure.  There is a Parent to Child relationship of entities and investments that create a kind of avenue that constantly flows financial value back through the generations to all the way to COEVAL itself.  Already sounds obscure, doesn\u2019t it?  Ok, let me try and break it down to its component parts:\n\nOnce the ICO is complete Monkey Capital will start a cooperative Parent relationship with existing companies that are invested in a diverse set of industries.\n\nThese companies will be provided capital to create and/or drive projects that generate revenue inside their portfolio.  Now the reason I said \u201ca cooperative Parent relationship\u201d is because each investment portfolio is managed independently of Monkey Capital.\n\nEach investment portfolio will create and offer out their own Child token that will be tradeable on the market and whose value is linked to the performance of that portfolio. That value comes to the token holders through dividends (paid in COEVAL, I might add). In addition to rewarding their own token holders the Children will split revenues generated by their investments with the Parent.\n\nHere comes a clever bit: \n\nAll Parents know that each child is unique, no two alike.\n\nThe Children will generate different amounts of revenue than each other and they will generate different revenue from one year to another.  So to deal with this the Parent will show Favoritism among its Children. \n\nWhat that means in this context is that Monkey Capital, as the Parent, will manage the amount of revenues that are collected from each Child in order to smooth out the overall flow of value by taking more of a share from some portfolios and less from others.  This will help stabilize all of the Parent and Child tokens on the volatile crypto market.\n\nThe Parent, Monkey Capital, will then distribute the revenue it has received amongst holders of its token MNY, again by purchasing COEVAL from the market to meet its needs. \n\nThere\u2019s one more clever bit:  Why in the world would Monkey Capital distribute the funds? Companies chew up dividends all the time by holding \u201cclient appreciation events\u201d in exotic locations and switching out the company Ferraris so the executives don\u2019t have to sit on scuffed leather.  Well, the reason Monkey Capital is going to is because the people in charge of handing out the dividends get paid by how much they give out.\n\nLet that one sink in.  \n\nThey call it an \u201caudit fee\u201d but it\u2019s essentially a commission based on how much COEVAL they can stuff into Waves wallets holding MNY.  They want to earn a dollar for the soda machine?  They better hand out $19 to the community first.  \n\nThat\u2019s the best I can do on the Dynamic Value Model; this post is already twice the the length of the last and I am just scratching the surface. If any of this sounds intriguing go take a look at the white paper then come over to the Slack channel and jump into the community discussion, ask questions, or better yet give ideas!  \n\nI\u2019m not actually affiliated with Monkey Capital, only holding onto some COEVAL to see where this goes and enjoying myself doing so.  If anything written here conflicts with the whitepaper then I am wrong and you should come tell me so I can fix it.\n",

Below I bring a closer look about this project to you all:-\n\n\nOn Trading Features:\n\nWith the plan of providing first hybrid exchange in the crypto space, more than coin-pairs, Dimensions will provide options and futures contracts trading. Derivatives trading is not so popular in the crypto space yet, but as crypto becomes more mainstream, derivatives trading should increase. For example many miners would like to utilize future contracts to reduce their risk.\u00a0\n\nThe best feature I am looking forward is the best buy/sell price aggregation feature, that will make arbitrage trading much easier.\u00a0\n\n\nOn Platform Network:\n\nDimensions plans to reach a state of 'hybrid' trading in terms of exchange network, it will start with a centralized network and and then build a decentralized network. The final stage is the hybrid state where traders can choose to trade on centralized (fast) network or decentralized network (secure) or a bit of both. I anticipate a hybrid exchange will significantly reduced the problems we are facing at the moment with exchanges and it gives users more choice.\u00a0\n\n\nOn Platform Technology:\u00a0\n\nA section of their whitepaper is about the technology they use to develop their centralized platform - Erlang. According to an article they posted a few days ago, it appeared to me Erlang will enable to them to grow as large as it required, they will not run into a situation where they have to stop accepting new registration due to technical problem. In their Telegram chat, they had mentioned that they will list all qualified new coins in the future without charging a listing fee. The earnings generated by these new coins trading will cover the cost to list them very quickly. This makes sense to me and solves my problem of finding a new exchange for each of my new altcoins.\u00a0\n\nThe article about Erlang can be found in their official Reddit, you might need to do Google cache to get pass the pay wall to read the article. \n\n\nOn ROI:\u00a0\n\nDimensions has a simple 15% trading fee sharing with token holders. Their token symbol is STC and as long as you hold STC in your wallet and own the private key, you will receive your share of 15% trading fee.\u00a0\n\n\nNeed more info? you can head over to their whitepaper for the detial\n\n",

            "text": "This is long sorry - there is no easy way to do a \"TLDR\" so if you don't want to read it, don't. \n\nI'll admit. As a newbie, when I looked up my Ethereum address on Kraken's web page I saw no Notice of \n\n\"Please do not deposit unsupported ERC20 tokens or they will be lost\" This is now a $3,000 - $4,000 error \n\nIn fact, as recently as a few hours ago I saw the following :: \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/rld06\nhttps://imgur.com/a/5OZNv\n\nThis gives NO indication of not being able to send ERC20 tokens to them - even today. Yes, 99% of ICO state not to use an exchange address but this particular one did not. I don't blame them. They were VERY small time, supported mostly by airdrops believe it or not, and as far as I know there was not a single coin bought prior to exchange listings. It was a coin called EBTC. I currently have around 2500 of them. \n\nYes, I probably should have known but I didn't. Kraken is LICENSED in the United States and I have every intention of finding out where their legal duties lie, in order to stay regulated in America. \n\nWhen I looked today the coins value were around $3,500 - last night when I saw $4,000 ... I lost it. \n\nI have written them multiple times and they swear to God there is NO WAY they can get the private key for security reasons. Kind of makes sense, right ? We don't want more hacks ... Here's the deal though.\n\nYour Ethereum address is not a throw away address @ Kraken. In other words, when you deposit they could do one of two things.\n\n1) Instantly forward those funds to another internal cold wallet - destroy the key and wallet address (the one you used) so no further access is allowed. In this case they would not be lying about a lack of access to the key.\n\n2) The other way things happen on almost every single exchange is you can deposit further funds to that address, withdraw funds from that address, so on ... \n\nIn order for this to be a constant process the private keys must be somewhere on their server. If not, they couldn't generate the transactions. \n\nPerhaps it is embedded into coding, sure, but someone at the top of the company has to have the information to gain access to that portion of the system. If they did not, disaster recovery processes would be impossible. That in itself would be an unbelievable security risk - period. \n\nI am currently looking for others who have lost ERC20 tokens to Kraken mainly, but would like to expand this to other exchanges as well too. \n\nI believe every single exchange absolutely must have a warning on their Ethereum deposit page that states \"Any ERC20 coins deposited here will be lost, 'Click Here' to understand ERC20 tokens\" or some similar verbage\n\nThe Companies holding the ICO do it themselves. If they hadn't can you imagine the outrage ? Even with this being the case I have heard numerous stories of people losing thousands of dollars because they didn't fully read the ICO website. \n\nRegardless people will make mistakes but if the warning is on BOTH the exchange page and the ICO page - I would not feel bad for them at all. \n\nI am not looking fr sympathy. I realized I made a mistake. However this mistake absolutely would have been avoided if there was a noticed on Kraken's website letting me know.\n\nI have went as far, at one point, to offer then 60% of the coins if they would return me the other 40%. They still refused to do so. This was a month or so ago when they were valued at $1800 total. \n\nSo this is what I would like to do. It may sound extreme but it is NOT just about the money to me. I want to gather a list of as many people as possible affected and speak to an attorney who ay take on the case. We would, obviously, only be able to take on companies licensed in the U.S.\n\nSo yeah this would include CoinBase as well if you have made a mistake their. It's in my best interest to have Kraken address this but I heavily believe more people would be helped out if CoinBase had to release those funds as well. \n\nTruth is o matter what any site says - they CAN give you your coins back. They simply don't want to spend the time doing so. Even if there was a \"Administrative Fee\" I would understand. At one point I was even wiling to offer over 50% of the funds. I was still refused. \n\nPlease don't cry \"We are against regulation, that's why Crypto is all about\" This isn't regulation, it is simply asking websites to put up a notification. \n\nIf you are already in the process of such a case please let me know. If you would like to be involved please let me know. If you know of an attorney who may be willing to take on such a case, please let me know. \n\nIf you are just going to flame me and call me an idiot - do so below ... Sending PM's kind of wastes everyone's time. Sending me a PM is the best way for us to communicate because it keeps your interest in this low profile as well. \n\nHope to hear from some of you. I am POSITIVE I am not the only person who has made this mistake one time before they learned their lesson\n",

It might not be a fast refund but it should come automatically.\n\nThat aside, you mentioned that this was your living money and are now in some financial trouble - iDice is literally a gambling coin. Please don't gamble with your living expenses, especially on a gambling related ICO. You are playing with fire, and can get yourself into some very serious problems.\n\nIt's clear you shouldn't trust yourself with this again. Best advice would be to save up a 4-6 month emergency fund before you even think about investing again. And stay far away from ICOs and ETH contracts until you are already comfortable doing normal trades between bitcoins and altcoins.\n\nIf anything, just buy some ETH and sit on it. Don't go getting creative with the money you need to survive on.\n\n**oh, p.s. --** did you buy into the ICO from a software (desktop) wallet, or from an online wallet/exchange?",

The Bancor Network is a decentralized liquidity network.\n\nThe integration of Dbrain with the Bancor Network will allow Dbrain\u2019s tokens to be converted to others like ETH, BNT (the Bancor Network Token) and many more. The list of Bancor-integrated tokens is regularly updated. Users will be able to easily convert their tokens with the Bancor Wallet or any Web3 wallet such as Metamask. DBR adoption of the Bancor Protocol gives crypto-traders additional options and further strengthens the network.\n\n\nDmitry Matskevich, CEO at Dbrain\n\u201cWe are actively working with our Dbrain community to build a personal relationship. As our community grows rapidly, we want to support them in every possible way,\u201d said Dbrain\u2019s CEO and co-founder Dmitry Matskevich. \u201cThe Bancor integration makes Dbrain more accessible. Everyone in our community will be thrilled to have continuous liquidity. It further solidifies our commitment to serve our supporters.\u201d\nDbrain is an open blockchain platform for turning raw data into real-world AI solutions. Data scientists have to spend considerable resources to validate and label raw data for neural networks training. Dbrain\u2019s platform uses crowdworkers from emerging markets to participate in the validation and labeling tasks.\n\nBlockchain protocols and internal cryptocurrency ensure transparency and fair revenue distribution among all stakeholders. Participants of the network use the Dbraincoin to interact with each other. It creates an ecosystem where data providers, crowdworkers, data scientists, application developers and businesses can work with each other seamlessly.\n\nBancor Protocol uses a \u201cconnector\u201d method which networks the connected tokens together. The Protocol provides only conversions of tokens through formulaically calculated prices without the need to match buyers and sellers.\n\nDbrain will activate a Relay Token with 1,5% of its circulating token supply within the week following the successful completion of the Token Distribution. Interested parties will be able to buy and sell DBR tokens directly from the Bancor Wallet or Web3 wallets. The Bancor Formula will continuously calculate the conversion prices.\n\nAbout Dbrain\n\nDbrain is an open blockchain platform to collectively build AI apps. Dbrain links crowd workforce with data scientists to turn raw data into real-world AI solutions for businesses, creating a win-win situation for all participants in the AI market. After securing $2.5 million in seed funding, Dbrain has reached a significant milestone by releasing the alpha version of the platform, including a web application and a Telegram bot. For more information, please visit https://dbrain.io.\n\nAbout Bancor\n\nBancor Protocol is a standard for the creation of Smart Tokens\u2122, cryptocurrencies with built-in convertibility directly through their smart contracts. Bancor utilizes an innovative token \u201cconnector\u201d method to enable formulaic price calculation and continuous liquidity for all integrated tokens, without needing to match two parties in an exchange. Smart Tokens interconnect to form token liquidity networks, allowing user-generated cryptocurrencies to thrive. To convert tokens instantly, visit the Bancor Wallet or join the Bancor Telegram group for more information.\nhttps://dbrain.io/",

This means that each holder of the token gets the right to receive income in the form of dividends, which will be proportional to the amount of ownership, relative to the current emission.\n\n\nDividends come in the form of a STOXUM token in a wallet almost in real time (once every ten minutes). Before sending dividends, the system aggregates revenues in different currencies and purchases the tokens sold on the platform to be sent as dividends. Such a mechanism promotes the growth of the token itself, and also allows you to keep tokens on your personal wallet and not become attached to one exchange.\n\n**Marketing model based on dividends**\n\nWe believe that once each owner of the token receives dividends almost in real time, then everyone will be interested in promoting and developing the service, and the share of word-of-mouth marketing will prevail and will cut advertising costs. The main marketing model can be found in our Whitepaper.\n\n**Customizable trading bots**\n\nWe decided to give each user the opportunity to run and configure trading bots in just a few clicks. Bots support a flexible system of bidding settings, and also have the ability to install a stop loss / take profit algorithm.\n\n**Open source client code and master nodes**\n\nAll the code can be viewed on GitHub.com. All the basic functionality will be developed by our team, but as the platform develops, each third-party developer can contribute to the functional part of the project.\n\n**Transparency of all financial transactions**\n\nEach token holder has exclusive rights to access all financial statistics of the platform. We believe that it is necessary to fully disclose all financial indicators in order to avoid suspicions or misunderstandings in the system of calculating dividends.\n\n**The voting system for adding coins**\nThe system will take into account such parameters as the total turnover of the account and the amount of ownership of the Stoxum tokens. At the same time, you can see the origin of each of the voices. This approach will help to avoid cheating or to effectively identify them.\n\n**Two-level affiliate program**\nWe give the opportunity to earn up to 50% of the income, which will receive the service for each user, whom you bring to the site. Also, partners will have the opportunity to create subaccounts - launch their affiliate program with controlled deductions for CPA-networks.\n\n**API and documentation**\nWe provide detailed documentation and flexible configuration of access rights for tokens. The platform will support work on HTTP and WebSocket protocols.\n\n**White Label**\nOne of the main directions of the platform will be the offer of a quick technical solution for organizing your own exchange of crypto-currencies or the introduction of software for working with cryptocurrency on your own sites.\n\nAll Whitelabel projects will be located in the same ecosystem and have a single liquidity base, which will allow from the first day of operation to give users access to all active orders within the ecosystem. Customers will be given the opportunity to visualize the customization of the interface, as well as some functional nodes, such as the choice of trading currencies that will be presented on the service and others.\n\nThe basic earnings of the whitelabel solution are your own registered site users. The owner of Whitelabel will be able to independently register his service and obtain all the necessary licenses to carry out legitimate activities - for this purpose, a verification system within the AML / KYC policy is available in the functional.\n\n**Why don't we disclose our names?**\n\nThe main idea of the project is to create a product managed by society. In this case, the product itself belongs to society, and not to some individuals.\n\n\n\nThe project team will be happy to answer all your questions",

The market of this area has long demanded changes, introduction of digital technologies and simplification of processes.\n\nBefore determining the differences between projects, it is necessary to divide them into groups in accordance with the tasks solved by these projects, and for example, there is a small audience for which there is a product (very generalized):\n\nGroup 1. Charts for property tokensisation. They are mainly focused on the segment of real estate investors. Such sites allow you to receive revenue from the acquisition of not the entire object, but parts of it. (Like joint ownership and trust management). The marker is most often attached to 1m2. This is far from all functions and possibilities, but common understanding of this information will improve. Most of the projects that have arisen in ICO, accomplish this task. \n\nGroup 2. Projects of real estate rental without agents (P2P). The site acts as an escrow agent for payments and services for placing objects. \n\nGroup 3. Projects - aggregators, offering solutions for convenient online selection of objects and transfer of property rights using Blokchain technologies. A database of objects is created which is used to serve customers. The target audience is all of us. It is both investors and customers who solve their housing problem and organisations which buy offices and other market participants. Token serves as \"fuel\" for transactions.\n\n BREM area belongs to the third group of projects. An aggregator is created in accordance with international bases and digital equipment and services for customers. With help of the service you can select an object online, book and conclude a deal, the data is recorded in a blockchain system.\n\nThere are several projects of this kind in the world, there are no substitutes in Russian Federation yet. \n\nThe main differences of the BREM project from international competitors are the use of artificial intelligence technologies in the selection, analysis and interaction with users. These technologies allow us to reach a completely new level of understanding of customers, their needs and requests. Users get an opportunity to objectively evaluate and compare objects, receive detailed investment forecasts, quickly and accurately analyze large amounts of information using digital assistants and much more. For developers, the portal organizes a service to attract investment (currently no other project has functions of this nature). \n\nExamples of some of our services:\n\n- Smart choice of real estate objects (for non-standard inquiries, for example \"ecological zone\", \"near kindergarten and school\", etc.); \n\n- Real estate: 3D tours, graphic modeling of the layout, video reviews of objects, comparison among themselves; \n\n- A neurobot consultant on any issues (legal, financial, construction, etc.); \n\n- Regarding real estate in round-the-clock access , developers' rating, real estate agencies , banks, insurance companies, online reservation services, buying and registering real estate, online lending (mortgage lending and lending to P2P in future);\n\n- An investment analyst based on artificial intelligence. The machine process of choosing the best time for buying real estate (evaluates more than 50 indicators). Forecasts on the benefits of buying a house / apartment, renting it and selling it after a certain number of years; \n\n- \"Safe transaction\" payment service. The portal acts as an intermediary in making payments under the contract, fixing funds in a enclosed wallet with prescribed terms of payment execution, if payment is in fiat currency. If payment is in crypto currency, then a smart contract is created;\n\n- The neuromodule for managing posts and advertising will allow you to find and eliminate fake ads, examine customer requests and will display the most suitable variants of objects first;\n\n - Social network for neighbors. It provides an opportunity to get socialize, communicate, solve housing and communal matters, choose management company, provide feedback to the Developer and solve other important organizational issues. \n\n - The module for developers to attract international investment for the construction of facilities. \n\nOur product solves problems of almost all real estate market participants from initial stages: \n\n- the choice object for clients, \n\n- attracting investment for construction for developers, \n\n- access to the entire base of facilities and generating income for real estate agents, \n\nAll of this on one site. We are pleased to be part of the new digital world and strive to apply technology to adress real challenges of the market.\n\nBremtoken.io",

            "text": "Hi ICO Crypto community,\n\nwhat does everybody thinks of the Keep Network project: https://keep.network/ \nMy summary based on initial review follows. \n- This project has the potential to become a widely used essential privacy instrastracture for Ethereum (possibly other blockchains in future).  In my view the project brings real value to the space -- privacy to the smart contracts!\n- Extremely wide range of usecases - in terms of existing projects think of privacy needed by \u201cstore data using blockchain\u201d such as Filecoin (where encryption is otherwise to be done by user), finance applications e.g. lending such as ETHlend/Lendroid, healthcare applications such as Medicalchain, etc. There are going to be a ton of projects needing a private computation protocol. Many projects imo do not even realize miners have access to whatever blockchain computes. Keep also enables the Dead Man\u2019s Switch, enabling inheritance (e.g. send my ETH to Bob if I do not check in in 6 months period) \u2013 this is a huge usecase on its own, see e.g. https://futurism.com/rules-concerning-cryptocurrency-inheritance/ \n- Token economics are as per state of the art (staking to prevent malicious behavior, no payments)\n- tech inspired by Dfinity \u2013 threshold relay that randomly selects a particular keep node to perform the given secret calculation, to reduce cost of a Sybil attack\n- solid team, teammembers i.a. from Oracle, IBM, Lockhead Martin, Microsoft, founders already created a functinoning bitcoin wallet\n- advised i.a. by Joe Urgo, Luis Cuende\n\nNOTE: Final conditions are N/A as of now. It seems team will release some more code before ICO stage (perhaps the threshold relay) \u2013 they do have github https://github.com/keep-network which I understand it is going to expand soon.\nI am definitely paying attention. The project can be compared to NuCypher project- Keep is more focused on private computation based on private data, NuCypher is Proxy re-encryption/file sharing.\n",

In this regard, we are able to have new partnership opportunities with major trading platforms.\n\nOur goal is to provide all investors with a variety of the most qualitative choice of sites for further trade. After receiving ATB Coin to their accounts, investors will be able to start trading now on the following crypto-exchanges: dabtc.com, yobit.net, localtrade.pro, bitlocal.io.\n\nThis list will expand and in the near future we will announce the connection of the largest sites with which preliminary agreements have been reached. At the moment, we are coordinating legal formalities with our new partner.\n\nStarting from today, the information about the balance sheets of investors will be transferred to the blockchain. This process will take several days due to the need for an increased level of control over the exact distribution of purchased coins. This is caused by the fact that in the first stage of the ICO there were several options for buying tokens and some investors contributed funds without first registering \u2013 for those users, the coins will be provided through the private key of the wallet by which the purchase was made.\n\nAfter the information is entered in the blockchain, the working network will be launched. In a couple of days, the network will work under the proof of work algorithm, as it is necessary to extract the genesis of the block, which will produce the first issue of coins.\n\nOnce the block is found, the network will switch to the proof of stake technology and the official wallets of the working network will be available for download. From now on, each investor will be able to receive previously bought coins on his ATB address.\n\nDue to the necessary time needed prepare the process, it has been decided to leave the investment opportunity for the whole period of the preparatory work. The cost of the token at the pre-launch stage will be 2.5 USD with the current discount remaining at 10%.\n\nWe also hastily aim to please investors who are waiting for mobile versions of applications. In a couple of days, the test versions for Android and IOS operating systems will be available on our website. The development team will make every effort to complete the work on the applications and release the final version of mobile wallets before the first issue of coins.\n\nWe thank all investors for their trust!",

Designed by a group of students with multidisciplinary competences, operating from all over the world. Our mission is to bring benefits of blockchain to everyoneOur mission is to bring benefits of blockchain to everyone!!!\n\nThe operations we'd like to provide to the markets with our idea are several:\n\nRaising funds, both through cryptocurrencies and money fiat currencies, we'll invest in the new crypto-markets seeking to exploit the most the volatility of these markets. Even investing a small amount, it will be possible to aim for high revenues. In this way, even those who have no technical-financial knowledge can benefit from the same high earning opportunities. \nWith \u201ctypical\u201d funds, we'll offer crypto-assets representing Fund quotes. Everyone will be able to transfer/exchange his quote at anytime, to everyone, in every part of the world.\n\n\nWe offer the possibility to participate in \u201cClouds Funds\u201d: common funds of investment where the same users decide the operations to undertake and the markets where to operate,benefiting from the financial and economic knowledge of all the group. Each user can post its own idea in a dedicated forum, and given many alternatives, the one that receive more consensus (according to the participation share) will be implemented.\n\nMoreover side consultancy services are provided to firms or investors, including risk management and the usage of virtual currencies. Out third goal is to help firms to enter in virtual currencies and Blockchain World, offering them ICO's advantages.\n\nThrough the advancement of the Financial Technology, it's possible to redesign every service offered from traditional banks (e.g factoring, loans, lombard credit), enhancing the efficiency in terms of cost and instantly providing this service worldwide, offering full transparency from banks' performances and ensuring full privacy to clients. Services, in a first phase, will be offered to the starts up and firms operating in the world of the Blockchain, but everyone will take advantage of it in the near future!\n\n\nOur intent is to contribute in the transformation of the financial world through an active participation of each stakeholder: here comes into play FINCOIN!!!!\n\n\n\nFINTECH BANK COIN \u2013 FINCOIN (FTB) \n\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/RBf2V4i.png\n\n\n\nFINCOIN is a digital asset. The total amount of FINCOINS created is 10 billions. Possessing a FINCOIN means the ownership of a participation share in FT BANK (exactly as a share). Over the right to obtain dividends, the possessor could also actively take part in the decisional process spending FINCOINS (to be sent to FTBANK/Project). This way, given more alternatives, FT Bank will operate in the exclusive interest of its stankeholders. Counting on the consensus of its investors, FT Bank will be able to adapt to the systematic changes to come in a very short time.\nFincoins will be also accepted by the Company as  payment method. \n***Dividends could be distributed in: fincoin, waves and bitcoin.\n****Fincoin is re-issuable, but we will not re-issue it for pay dividends. They are re-issuable only for give to Fincoiners the possibility to replicate the \u201cissuing new share\u201d, Fincoiners have the right to buy new issuing before the market placement (Right of option).\n\n\nWith Fincoins people will be able to redirect company's management:\nEveryone will be able to propose an idea and share his thoughts: these will be represented by a wallet. Once the wallet receive enough Fincoins (0.3% of the amount of total Fincoins subtracted from total Fincoins held by the company), a referendum will be launched. With this referendum Fincoiners will be able to accept or reject the propose, sending fincoins in the dedicated wallet.\n\nReferendums will also be proposed by the company.\n\nAll Fincoins received will be held by the company (as treasury shares).\n\n BY DOING SO SHAREHOLDERS WHO AIM FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE DECISIONAL PROCESS WILL GAIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT BY SPENDING FINCOINS RATHER THEN SHAREHOLDERS WHO REFUSE TO TAKE PART IN THE DECISIONMAKING PROCESS BY NON VOTING, WILL NOT SPEND THEIR \u201cSHARES\u201d WITH ALSO GAINING MORE DIVIDENDS. THAT'S THE REVERSE OPERATION OF PREFERRED STOCKS   \n\nWith this mechanism shareholders who refuse to participate will not lose their share and will gain more dividends. That's the reverse operation  of Preferred Stocks.\n\n\n\nFINCOINS are created through the circuit \u201cWaves Platform\u201d. This platform also plays the role of decentralised Exchange where whoever creates a cryptocurrency shall be able to exchange it with any other already existing (Bitcoin e.g),or with flat currencies (euros,dollars,yuan). Being a decentralised platform ,any currency created will always be accepted by the platform whatever happens. Fincoins, other than on Waves, will also be traded on other exchanges.\n\nFIRST REFERENDUM WILL BE ABOUT THE COMPANY NAME!!!\nIn the period between the end of Pre-sale and Ico we ask you to send us possibles company names and brands, we will choose 3 of them, and, after the Ico, we will induce OUR first referendum!\n\n\n\nWE DON'T WANT SELL FINCOINS FOR A SCAM PROJECT OR TO GIVE EARN TO EVERY \u201cEARLY ADOPTER\u201d.

In many countries, health care costs have even exceeded the increase in GDP and the revenue from taxes which fund healthcare. This is not only the story of developing countries, but the developed world is also in the same condition. It is expected that if the healthcare costs keep rising by the mid-century they will become unaffordable by mid-century. The reasons behind rising healthcare costs are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Increase in aging population \n\n\u2022 Chronic illness \n\n\u2022 Advances in medicine\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CURES token](https://www.curestoken.com/) is designed to address the problem of rising healthcare costs in an innovative way. They have plans to empower patients, health app developers, medical service providers, and equipment suppliers with the decentralized health care system. The company is going to use emerging blockchain technology to reduce health care costs and maximize scare resources within the healthcare sector. It will create near virtual competition and capitalize on synergy to add value to all relevant stakeholders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Six Pillars of CURES token**\n\n**App store for Health Apps (HAPP store)**\n\nThe project has plans to offer its own apps which are aimed at improving eyesight, vision, and quality of life.

Medical service providers can offer these contracts at a discount in return for payment now. It will enable both patients and medical service providers to buy and sell these contracts to maximize their scare resources.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Marketplace and trust review platform**\n\nThe decentralized system will help the patient to find cost-effective medical service providers globally. The patients no longer have to depend on recommendations. The decentralized system will ensure security and nurture perfect competition. Once a transaction is completed, the patient is allowed to post a review; it will help other patients to make an informed decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Trading platform**\n\nMedical equipment supplier will be able to sell their equipment directly to patients, clinics, and hospitals via CURES trading platform. It will eliminate the middlemen from the supply chain which will help in reducing the cost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Charitable trust fund**\n\nCURES have a separate legal entity which is funded by 5% of the token supply and voluntary contribution by token users. The entity will fund the charitable projects which will improve the healthcare services in the deprived regions of the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese six pillars of CURES make it a universal ecosystem of services which is available to all patients, healthcare providers and other stakeholders of the healthcare industry.

Where control over our personal information is concerned, we believed three factors could more than others.*\n* *1) Transparency 2) Security 3) Independence With cloud services, data centres, managed services and the like, you still have centralised control over personal data, there is therefore not the personal independence to directly manage your data. Security is still being either hacked directly or, more likely, circumvented through internal fraud. And with little to no visibility of the various processes that go into the procurement and management of our data, we are none the wiser as to its usage. We therefore believe decentralised ledger technology (DLT) satisfies our three primary criteria and is the best solution for this particular problem.*\n* *Dayta is a unique personal data service that combines the user needs for security with the financial need for compensation of their data\u2019s usage.
