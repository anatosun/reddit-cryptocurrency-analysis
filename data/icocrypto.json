                    "response": " Decentralized threat data is valuable for analysts on common needs, but challenging to enact in a timely manner.\n\nFor example, National Vulnerability Database, the centralized repository for vulnerability disclosure in the United States, relies on vendors reporting vulnerabilities and their possible impact. This means 1. The database is not comprehensive (but it\u2019s pretty good), 2. There is frequently a delay in vulnerability disclosure to the database, with a median of 7 days from vendor disclosure to disclosure in NVD.\n\nCommon open threat feeds can suffer from the same fate when using threat intelligence platforms or security services, like MSSPs, to aggregate. In one example, I was working with a client who saw an indicator in their SIEM popping us as ransomware C2 according to a well known threat feed. When they reached out to their MSSP for more context, they were told that the IOC actually aged out a few days prior. They were not pleased.\n\nAnother challenge is the inherent difficulty in accessing and aggregating the data in the first place. David Bianca\u2019s Pyramid of Pain is a great way to understand difficulty vs value. Low level IOCs, like detecting malicious IPs and hashes is relatively trivial (e.g. Broad scanning servers for signatures of RAT controllers; Shodan has a malware scanner for this). Other data, like endpoint telemetry from a broad spectrum of personal and commercial enterprises or criminal actors on dark web forums for discussions of exploit proof-of-concept code is a whole other consideration. These are expensive to access and maintain, require special technology and knowledge, and are far more valuable as they give insight to adversary tools and TTPs.\n\nHope this provides some insight.\n\nCitation: [https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-disclosure-delay/](https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-disclosure-delay/)\n\nHow do you respond to this?

As long as you structure your company correctly, so will fall within the company's regulatory framework. It then depends on what project you want to do, in regards to what licenses you will need to apply for.\n\nDominium as a property portal does not need any licenses at all, but as we will allow companies to create tokenised assets and raise money, we will need a license for this.\n\nThese licenses differ per country and we are not even 100% sure we will apply for the first license. It will be Europe, but it does not have to be the Netherlands, the UK or Germany, as they may not be the most advantageous jurisdictions.\n\nIt may be Malta, Switzerland, Gibraltar, Jersey, etc.\n\nFor now we are building the platform and once we are ready we will connect it to the test net and then go live with the child chain. We do this with our own products and companies, so we do not need licenses or anything else for that matter to complete Dominium. We will inform the community as soon as we have a clear answer where we will obtain the correct license(s) from.\n\nThat answers 1 and 2.\n\nArdor does have competition, but we chose Ardor as the platform is and has been stable for years and they have controlled assets, which means that we need to approve the user prior to them being able to trade in the tokenised asset. This will 100% be a regulatory requirement for tokenised security assets and any other platform that does not have this will eventually end up with legal issues.\n\nPoS and bloat solutions were a factor and singleton assets were another.\n\nScaling/transactions per second will be something we will have to monitor carefully. but that is something for the future and Ardor is aware that they need to stay on top of this if they really want to get many projects on the Ardor platform. We are a huge user case for them and they are as excited as we are to work together.",

However, I tend to be pretty good at reading strategies.\n\nIt will be a social payment system first. They'll announce that you can send money to your friends and businesses using cryptocurrency for a small fee (rather venmo-esque). Then they will introduce the Facebook token with reduced fees. The real play here is the gift card play, many will never be used, and even for ones that are used Facebook gets the money earlier.\n\nAt the same time they will expand the offerings available. The p2p sales area will move to facecoin first, the advertising buy will be facecoin, social games will transparently (for a fee for the game but invisible to you) be able to accept facecoin.\n\nThis is really about trapping money inside Facebook where they can invest it and keep the rewards.\n\nDon't get too excited, it will not benefit you",
