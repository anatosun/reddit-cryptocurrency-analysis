From the experience of living in Portugal, the entirety of my life, Portuguese government never takes the lead on new stuff they'll wait for another country to do the work so they can copy it. \n\nNow I don't mind the taxation, Madeira has been doing it for years now at 13% tax, and it's one of the most sought after places to start a crypto company by Portuguese crypto enthusiasts. If you wonder why that is, is because everyone in Portugal knew this day would eventually come, and they would rather pay 13% in Madeira, than the probable +20%, from mainland Portugal.",
