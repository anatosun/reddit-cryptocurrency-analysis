Once an equilibrium is reached, there's nothing to protect an individual from market forces that would cause a farmer to need to charge more and more BTC for their eggs in order to be able to pay the increasing price of their family's bread which the flour miller has to charge because the wheat farmer is charging more in order to afford... etc. Inflation is the systemic result of market forces.\n\nHyperinflation (50% or more rise in prices over a period of a month) is generally the result of large amounts of currency being pumped into an economy to combat external forces such as debt, war or simply as a result of corruption. Cryptocurrencies protect against hyperinflation because the group of people who can \"turn the crank\" to produce more of the currency faster are not directly controlled by a single government, and so cannot be pressured to turn that crank when a government is in trouble.\n\nThat being said, lots of cryptocurrency advocates get confused by this and think that simple inflation cannot happen with cryptocurrencies because they see exchange rates with fiat currencies currently rising.",

We decide if something is valuable or not. \n\nWe have made things money like seashells,  tulips, very  giant and havey stone rocks, beads, **metal**(aka gold) , etc. \n\nThe reason we don't use a lot, if not, most of the money here are due to all the characteristics these objects have and how easy they were to be \"money\".\n\nGold is still here due to its properties of being good money, being very good. Gold has enough characteristics where we can use a non-government form of money.\n\nEven gold however, has its limitations. Bitcoin attempts to be another form of money. It's properties are judged by people, and those that like them can join in and start using it together. Just like gold.\n\nI highly recommend you take a look at the history of raistones [(wiki)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stones). This form of money helps break the mold a bit of what money can be. I actually see a lot of similarities   with raistones and crypto. Still, raistone money is very unique and interesting. \n\nTL; DR: Money is belief. You can believe it, and use it. Or you don't.",

It doesn't matter who makes the change to the code, no one is going to run it. Coinbase isn't going to run it because they know no one else will and they'll just be forking themselves off onto a lonely network of one, with no tasty trading fees for them. Miners aren't going to run it either, because they know their fork will be essentially worthless.\n\nSegwit2x failed miserably and it wasn't nearly as dramatic a change as PoS. \n\nGreenpeace has no idea what they're messing with.

Using *more power* to spin up an alt currency doesn't help that concern.\n\nLobbying the people who currently control the blockchain is potentially a way to achieve change. Like it or not, there's a governmental structure established by the blockchain, a government that is appointed based on contribution, and there are going to be a lot of people, groups, corporations and governments seeking to have those core folks make changes, just like any governmental structure.\n\nMaybe you agree that this particular change is a good or bad one, but it's certainly a valid point of discussion.",

Many newer cryptocurrencies are low consumers of energy or carbon-neutral because they use a better model: proof-of-stake.\n\n> We know a basic software code change could reduce Bitcoin\u2019s energy use by 99.9%. If only 30 people \u2014 the key miners, exchanges, and core developers who build and contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s code \u2014 agreed to reinvent proof-of-work mining or move to a low-energy protocol, Bitcoin would stop polluting the planet. So why isn\u2019t Bitcoin changing its code?\n\nSo yeah, they're lobbying the folks who can actually make the change to do so. Now, whether you feel that that change is warranted or prudent, I leave up to you. I'm just pointing out that this isn't a bunch of journalists creating a clickbait article.

It's valid; that doesn't mean I agree.\n\nThe point is that Bitcoin is consuming a massive amount of power and if, as Bitcoin enthusiasts like to claim, it's destined to become much, much more widely used, then it's likely that mining resources put into it will grow exponentially.\n\nThat kind of power use could dramatically alter the landscape for any attempt to overall reduce power consumption.\n\nThat's the point they're making.

We WILL NOT REDUCE energy consumption. This is impossible without killing off people or forcing them to live a fundamentally worse lifestyle. The only alternative is to make it profitable to produce excess energy, and the most profitable forms of producing excess energy do not require carbon. RIGHT NOW bitcoin is being used to capture flared gas that is otherwise wasted and put directly into the atmosphere. Bitcoin miners will be the first buyer for El Salvadors massive geothermal energy source which would otherwise be producing energy far in excess of what is possible to produce and transport using high voltage transformers. It encourages and makes profitable investments in renewable sources which are otherwise unprofitable to produce in excess, LOWERING the cost of energy for individuals while increasing clean energy production. Do you know what the prior use of excess energy has been? Aluminum smelting. This requires massive investment in an unmovable plant, which becomes a massive environmental hazard once it inevitably loses access to its excess energy source.\n\nBut hey, keep listening to the propaganda by oil and gas companies who desperately want to leech out as much carbon and wealth as possible from their zombified, unprofitable industry.\n\nhttps://assets-global.website-files.com/614e11536f66309636c98688/616dbaa0e7aa2af652d58983_NYDIG-BitcoinNetZero_SML.pdf\n\nhttps://assets.ctfassets.net/2d5q1td6cyxq/5mRjc9X5LTXFFihIlTt7QK/e7bcba47217b60423a01a357e036105e/BCEI_White_Paper.pdf\n\nhttps://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/06/how-blockchain-and-cryptocurrencies-can-help-build-a-greener-future/\n\nhttps://www.ge.com/news/reports/renewable-energy-taking-page-bitcoin\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/05/19/the-last-word-on-bitcoins-energy-consumption/",

When you take an objective view, proof of stake is more of a pyramid scheme than Bitcoin ever is - that actively rewards the larger whales with even more coins and influence (unlike Bitcoin).\n\nBut here's a game for you.... whenever you see someone arguing for PoS, check to see if they ever go into the advantages of Proof of Stake that don't include energy consumption or government support.\n\nShockingly, I rarely see the actual use case of PoS being discussed. It's like all people have heard about proof of stake is that it's another way of creating crypto that happens to be less energy intensive. They don't realise that you can't have your cake and eat it - but that's what happens when you view it all as just \"magic internet money\".

We WILL NOT REDUCE energy consumption. This is impossible without killing off people or forcing them to live a fundamentally worse lifestyle. The only alternative is to make it profitable to produce excess energy, and the most profitable forms of producing excess energy do not require carbon. RIGHT NOW bitcoin is being used to capture flared gas that is otherwise wasted and put directly into the atmosphere. Bitcoin miners will be the first buyer for El Salvadors massive geothermal energy source which would otherwise be producing energy far in excess of what is possible to produce and transport using high voltage transformers. It encourages and makes profitable investments in renewable sources which are otherwise unprofitable to produce in excess, LOWERING the cost of energy for individuals while increasing clean energy production. Do you know what the prior use of excess energy has been? Aluminum smelting. This requires massive investment in an unmovable plant, which becomes a massive environmental hazard once it inevitably loses access to its excess energy source. \n\nBut hey, keep listening to the propaganda by oil and gas companies who desperately want to leech out as much carbon and wealth as possible from their zombified, unprofitable industry.  \n\nhttps://assets-global.website-files.com/614e11536f66309636c98688/616dbaa0e7aa2af652d58983_NYDIG-BitcoinNetZero_SML.pdf\n\nhttps://assets.ctfassets.net/2d5q1td6cyxq/5mRjc9X5LTXFFihIlTt7QK/e7bcba47217b60423a01a357e036105e/BCEI_White_Paper.pdf\n\nhttps://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/06/how-blockchain-and-cryptocurrencies-can-help-build-a-greener-future/\n\nhttps://www.ge.com/news/reports/renewable-energy-taking-page-bitcoin\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/05/19/the-last-word-on-bitcoins-energy-consumption/",

Why would we want to expend so much energy on something that has no apparent utility in the real world? \n\n>What material benefit does bitcoin provide that makes it worth such energy expenditure?\n\nI've always had an issue with this question. Right now, Bitcoin provides little material benefit. Sure, I can transact with it, but barely anyone accepts it, and trusted solutions currently are superior in ease of use and are more widespread. That's exactly the reason why you asked for *material* benefits since you can already answer the question by yourself.\n\nLet's rephrase the question then. \n\n>What benefit does bitcoin provide that makes it worth such energy expenditure?\n\nIt's trustless, fair and global. Trustless, because I have to trust **nobody**. Anything I can do on the network I can do myself, be it holding or transacting value, or verifying that my or other values have been transacted correctly. In the sphere of the network I am self-sufficient. Fair, because anyone can join the network and there are no mechanisms to restrict anyone's participation. Also fair, because it is very (computationally) easy with today's hardware to participate and be self-sufficient in the network. Global, because it is and can actually be used anywhere in the world (provided you have an internet connection, of course).\n\nTraditional financial systems do not tick any of those boxes. Banks using fiat money are neither trustless, because you trust politicians and central banks to not convert your value to thin air, or expressed more diplomatically, to have a reasonable monetary policy; nor are they fair, because they can and do restrict and completely bar people from using their services for whatever reason they might seem fit; nor are they global, because you can't use a dollar in Europe, or a euro in Asia, or a rupee in America. None of this will ever change with traditional financial systems. \n\nTrustlessness, fairness and globality are, in my opinion, absolutely inevitable characteristics of a true world currency, and since the introduction of a world currency is just a matter of time, we should absolutely be thinking about what such a currency should look like.\n\nSo why did I shift the focus from \"realized\" benefits of Bitcoin to unrealized ones? Because Bitcoin's value proposition is not really useful currently. We are not in the process of implementing a world currency right now. But I suspect that we will be some time, and I'd much rather have Bitcoin as an option than some intransparent, controlled-by-few pile of shit digital currency forced on us by lack of alternatives.\n\nAnyways, that's just my value proposition for Bitcoin. Other people might have different views on it. So instead of asserting that Bitcoin has no value from the fact that it has no current *material* benefits, you should maybe ask why people see value in it at all. \n\nOh, and since we were in the midst of discussing energy consumption and environmental impact, I just want to add that the whole discussion would be pretty much over if countries actually did something useful like implementing carbon tax, which would not only decrease non-fossil energy consumption in Bitcoin, but also in any other energy-consuming industry sector, thus shifting the market to renewables by purely economic means. Cool, huh?",

We could literally be living in a much more energy dense civilization, and mostly clean energy, if it wasn't for these short-sighted virtue-signalling r*tards.\n\nAnd make no mistake, they are forwarding the same type of fundamentally wrong narratives today: its all scarcity mentality, instead of abundance mentality.  They are unreasonably alarmist, too, of course; but let's even say that they are totally correct in their alarmism and that the very worst case scenarios of climate change play out- it still makes way more sense to build, grow, and adapt- rather than try to drag society back to the stone ages, in order to avoid having the climate...drag us back to..the..stone ages.\n\nIt's true that most of it is hype so far- that bitcoin mining is using waste heat and renewables and creating incentives to scale renewables, or sell their waste heat- but it's also not far off and there are scant few transaction costs standing in the way of it being very profitable for miners to use and re-use and promote energy in all these utopian-sounding ways.\n\nWe need to produce *more*, not less; and we need to simply continue to find ways of profitably recycling/upcycling (see \"dematerialization\") what we now think of as 'waste'. We need to nuclearize. Our best chance of saving ourselves **and** the environment is by far to create abundance, not cower to scarcity and perverse forms of conservationist.\n\nBitcoin's energy consumption will not grow forever (is indeed already slowing), it was designed to be over-secured up front.  It's energy use can and should be a tiny blip on the radar of the massive amounts of clean energy we could be producing.\n\nIn the meantime, there's no real case (just blind ideological hatred) for banning proof of work, anymore than there's a case for banning all sporting events (think of all the travel and congestion and fossil fuel use and negative societal externalities which sporting events entail...after all, it's more entertainment that a lot of us don't care for...so we should ban it to save the environment, right? Probably uses more energy than Sweden, globally).\n\nThere's a good case to simply implement carbon taxes (equally, on all uses of c02-producing activities), and let the chips fall where they may on how much that disincentivizes bitcoin mining or traditional banking or sporting events.",

As far as I understand it, the *pro*\\-bitcoin energy argument is:\n\n1. The energy used is (essentially) the energy needed to secure the network, *not* the energy per transaction.\n2. Given broad adoption of bitcoin, nearly all transactions will be done on secondary layers (e.g. lightning), so energy per transaction will become almost nil.\n3. Bitcoin uses a lot of energy but not appreciably more than any other large industry with comparable utility for the world.\n4. Furthermore, because of the nature of bitcoin, it is uniquely suited to exploiting otherwise underused energy sources, meaning that for all the utility it provides, it is still *more* efficient than a comparable industry would be.\n\nThis all makes sense to me. But I've realized I don't have a good sense of *how much* the energy use will grow as the price grows (if it will).\n\nA. Is there something I'm missing from my *pro*\\-bitcoin argument?\n\nB. What are the factors that affect the energy use of bitcoin and how much do they affect it?\n\nC. Do we have models that can predict approximate kW-hr usage given various levels of world adoption?\n\n\\[Edit: questions more obvious\\]",

They don't give a shit about Monsanto and their cancerous products. They also don't give a shit about nature because everywhere in the west they plant gen modified plants.

The problem is their ideas/what they say, doesn't match what they do.\n\nThey simply can't implement their own policies, because they are indeed a bunch of incompetent idiots looking for well paid puppet positions and couldn't care less about you, the environment or the poor like they so proudly like to pretend. That requires real, tangible work that they aren't capable of doing.\n\nI don't think the right wing is any better by the way. All these people want is power and they'll say anything to get your vote. There are exceptions on both sides of course, but those exceptions don't last long, because the party wants sheep saying \"yes\", not critical thinkers.\n\nTLDR: we're governed by incompetent ass-lickers, no matter if you look left or right.

Every anarchist I know would call themselves far-left.

There is no meaningful distinction between top-down rule and authortarianism of a state or of a corporation. Remember that the structure of fascism is corporatism: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism#Fascist_corporatism\n\n>Leftists government\n\nNo, in left-wing politics the aim is abolition of the state. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withering_away_of_the_state You do that by making sure everyone has a fair share of freedom, not just the wealthy or the lucky.\n\n>centralised government\n\nNo, in left-wing politics you oppose centralisation.

They were already yapping about climate (change) back in the 80s of last century. Back then they tried to scare us with stories of \"acid rain\" killing all the vegetation within 20 years.

Iterating the algorithm is what secures the network so, improving the efficiency of sha256 or switching it out for a more efficient algorithm only means it will iterate faster for the same amount of work and miners will still consume the same amount of power to secure the network. In other words, you can't change the code to reduce power consumption.\n\nThe mining hardware is where efficiency is progressing by leaps and bounds. For example, the [Bitmain Antminer S19 XP](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/bitmain/antminer-s19-xp-140th) consumes just 0.022 joules per gigahash. That's 46.5 billion hashes per watt. But, once again, miners seek to spend as much power as they can generate which means any gains in efficiency will increase performance but not reduce power consumption.",
