            "selftext": "Often times critiques against Proof of Stake boil down to some form of \"you are letting the richest holders control the network,\" and while that makes sense to me, I wonder if those who argue in favor of Proof of Stake acknowledge or reject that assertion, and how they justify that. I tend to think \"Bitcoin Maxxis\" or more broadly PoW > PoS arguments get many things right but I do notice they sometimes don't feel the need to take their arguments too deeply, so I would like to offer the opportunity to do that.\n\nThere are surely many interesting arguments on both sides that are rarely explored, like:\n\n* Don't the wealthiest miners also have the ability to control Bitcoin in a similar fashion? How significant is the fact that hash power is external to the network while stake is internal?\n\n* Slashing solves the fundamental attack of PoS, the \"nothing at stake attack.\" What are the downsides to slashing and why isn't PoS with slashing the standard if it readily makes PoS secure?\n\n* Do staking pools which offer liquid capital in exchange for the staked native token/coin threaten to centralize the network?\n\n* Similarly, do DeFi protocols which offer more return on the base asset than staking does threaten to funnel coins away from staking, where they bolster security, to lending protocols, where they do not?\n\nI'm not looking to affirm any preconceptions, but if you feel passionately about any of this I'd like to hear why and I'm willing to read or watch anything offering to go in depth into this discussion. I understand Ethereum is the de-facto leader on the subject (even if they aren't quite there yet) and that their proposals aren't always simple; I personally have decent experience researching blockchain technology and cryptography and am willing to go  down any rabbit holes offered, so don't be shy to get technical. \n\nThanks in advance.",

This means that in general you don't have miners hoarding all the tokens.\n\nFor Proof of Stake there is no reason for a staker to sell the tokens they receive. This is great for price as it means people hold their tokens but means that the tokens end up less distributed than proof of work tokens. It also means that over time, stakers end up with a larger and larger share of the tokens as staking rewards are higher than the inflation level of tokens. This means the stakers also get more control of the network over time.\n\nWith proof of work, miners have to constantly invest more and more if they want to gain more control of the network but with staking it just happens naturally\n\nThere are many advantages to proof of stake but I think people forget about the advantages of proof of work",

IIRC the target is to have around 20% of the total Ether supply staked - once that much is staked the rate of return becomes small enough that it's not really worth it to stake any more, there are better returns to be had by doing things other than staking with that money.

You could use that Ether for all sorts of other things, including selling it and buying traditional investments like government bonds or whatnot. So when the rate of return for staking dips below the return you get for those other options there's going to be a pressure driving some stakers to withdraw their stakes.",

Protocols which allow pooled staking and distribute a liquid token in return already exist, however. \n\nRegarding the document, it appears there is a slight contradiction. Staking is rewarded less the more stake is online, but the bottom cites the risk of lending protocols offering competitive returns against staking, implying that network security will suffer as stakers *lend* instead. If accruing stake to increase security is important, it seems slippery that they have to decrease the incentive to stake as more stake accrues. Seems like that favors existing large stakers.",

As the staked amount goes up the staking reward goes down, and other things become competitive. This prevents additional stakes being added because people have better things to do with their money.\n\nThe goal is not to try to get every single Ether possible locked up in the staking contract. That would result in poor liquidity for the ecosystem as a whole. So the rewards are set up to try to achieve a natural equilibrium, where people only add new stake if the amount staked is \"too low\" and withdraw stake if it's \"too high.\"\n\nWhether this favors large stakers is debatable. I would expect large stakers to be more adept at moving their money between whatever makes them the most return, for example, so I'd expect them to be quicker to withdraw stake if the returns become unfavorable. Small stakers would seem more likely to me to just \"let it ride\". Regardless, though, there isn't a way to distinguish large stakers from small stakers on a protocol level. It shouldn't really matter, PoS works fine either way.",

Seems trivially easy to discourage existing small stakers from remaining  when they could go to whatever  DeFi protocol becomes competitive after large stakers drive returns down.

It does make sense though that hashing has a far more elastic supply than the stake in a PoS network, and can actually deal with 51% threats by simply generating more hash. Easier said than done but that market force does exist in PoW but not necessarily PoS.\n\nThe counter argument is that you can just buy more stake, obviously an attacker may refuse to give it up but again its a market dynamic and their ability to control the network will be priced in - of course, the premium one would pay for stake that can be used to 51% attack to the last owner, but not necessarily the new owner, doesn't justify paying it unless you are buying to control majority stake yourself.",

Miners who don\u2019t update their node will have their blocks rejected by the node network and be essentially mining another blockchain.\n\nIn a sense, participants in the node network are like stakeholders without the formal staking mechanism of POS (and no reward). It functions like governance via a super duper majority since no one wants to enact a UASF. All of this is specific to Bitcoin and I am not commenting on other POW chains. \n\nThis robust node network is essential in Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization because it separates the roles of confirmation/consensus(nodes) and security (miners). Moreover, while confirmation is driven by social consensus, security is driven by physics. \n\nIn POS the roles of confirmation and security are combined into a single role.

Under proof of work you can mine more efficiently using an expensive industrial-scale mining operation than you can with an ASIC in your apartment closet, so the rich earn a higher rate of return under PoW than the poor do.\n\nUnder Ethereum's PoS there's just the flat cost of the computer you're running the validating node software on, which can be an ordinary laptop or whatever. It's pretty cheap. Beyond that there are no costs associated with validating, so the rate of return is almost exactly the same for a rich staker as a poor one. Someone who's staked 3200 Ether and someone who's staked 32 Ether will both get the same percentage return on their investment.\n\nBelow 32 Ether staked the rate of return does go down because then you're having to stake as part of a pool, and there'll be pool fees on top. But that's on a layer above the protocol itself so it's hard to consider an inherent problem.\n\nWhenever \"the rich get richer\" brought up as an argument against PoS, it's actually much more of an argument against PoW.",
