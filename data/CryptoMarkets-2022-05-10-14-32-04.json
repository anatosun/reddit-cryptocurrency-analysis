All of these are very safe in my opinion, and you can lower your risk by dividing your entire sum among different platforms: [Haru Invest](https://haruinvest.com/), [Nexo](https://nexo.io/) and [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/).\n\nStablecoins can earn up a good amount of APY% on these platforms.

Terra is -43% on the day, and -63% on the weekly!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be honest, Terra at $30 is a good buy for holding until the next wave, but if it goes to $20, that would also be nice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: sorry, it is now -95% in only 48 hours!  The VCs have already left, they bought at less than one dollar btw during the ICO. Haha this will be made a movie soon.
