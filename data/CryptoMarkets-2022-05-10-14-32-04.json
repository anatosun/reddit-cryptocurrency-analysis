Now I'm not going to put most of my crypto investments into stablecoins, but it would be good to know that a portion of my worth isn't wiped out with each dip.\n\nHere are some of the platforms I recommend. All of these are very safe in my opinion, and you can lower your risk by dividing your entire sum among different platforms: [Haru Invest](https://haruinvest.com/), [Nexo](https://nexo.io/) and [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/).\n\nStablecoins can earn up a good amount of APY% on these platforms. Would be a great investment to sleep on for a few years and get passive income.",
