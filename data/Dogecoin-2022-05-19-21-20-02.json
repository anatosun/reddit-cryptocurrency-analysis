Luckily they cannot pass the vote. you still have to pay taxes on profits taken though thats at I believe 24% so make sure you talk with your accountant when tax season comes. And yes you have to report it now, the government passed last November a new law acquiring all crypto brokerages to report all US base accounts trades and profits/losses to the IRS to see if people are lying/trying to hide money.",
