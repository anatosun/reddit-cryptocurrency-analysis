They ensure that multi-chain networks are kept secure while not compromising decentralization.\n\nThe polkadot architecture and parachains are great. Personally, I believe it will bring functionality and utility. I'm also looking forward to the release of the XCM. When I read [this](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/24/social-media-disruptor-project-liberty-to-run-on-polkadots-blockchain-network/), I got even more intrigued as this could be a very good service for everyone in the Polkadot ecosystem and Web 3 in general.\n\nI like DOT, but I hope they get some non-engineers to chime in on the UX because it appears to be designed by and for engineers, which I believe is a big problem.",

One of which is rigorous auditing of everything. One of the reasons polkadot seems to move fairly slow. Kusama was also introduced as a real world environment to implement changes prior to launching on polkadot.",

Also subnets (Blockchains) on ICP can communicate with each other securely using chain key cryptography without a central hub to validate transactions. \n\nDOT is a third gen protocol and extremely advanced and it can be improved by eliminating some web 2 dependencies and moving both front and back ends on chain for ecosystem dAPPS to make them truly decentralized and secure. As TVL on the protocol gets bigger, the front ends will become a huge attack vector, which may result in stolen funds or disruption to services.",
