            "selftext": "----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nBitcoin is scarce, decentralized, and global digital **money** that cannot be censored.\n\n* Transactions generally cannot be reversed\n* Less than 21 million Bitcoin will exist \n* Bitcoin is highly divisible to allow for micro-transactions (up to 13 decimal places in a payment channel)\n* Bitcoin is an open, collaborative project that no company or government controls belonging to the people\n* Bitcoin is more than just money, but a secure timestamping ledger, payment rail, and smart contract platform\n\nPlease read the Whitepaper for an general overview of bitcoin as designed \n\nhttps://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nQuick Advice\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n* **Do not respond to strangers messaging you** with investment advice or offers and read how to avoid being scammed from the posts below.\n\n* Do not *invest* in Bitcoin until you do basic research, paid off all high interest debt, and have a emergency savings account of a stable fiat currency.  \n\n* If *investing* do not expect to get rich quickly. You should expect to wait *at least* 1-2 years before taking profits. Bitcoin is currently very volatile. In the interim spend and replace Bitcoin because its a useful currency. \n\n* Beginners should avoid all mining and day trading until at least very familiar with Bitcoin. Mining is very professional(You cannot efficiently mine with your computer and need to buy special ASIC machines) and most people lose money day trading. \n\n* Never store your Bitcoins on an exchange or web wallet. Buy your bitcoins and withdraw it to your personal wallet where you actually own them instead of IOUs. Services like Robinhood, webull, and Revoult should be avoided because you cannot withdraw or use Bitcoin. \n\n* Make sure you make a backup of your wallet(software holding keys to your BTC) and preferably keep it offline and physical and private. Typically 12 to 24 words you write down on paper or metal. This onetime backup will restore all your keys, addresses , and Bitcoins on a new wallet if you lose your old wallet.\n\n* Beginners should avoid altcoins, tokens, and ICOs at least initially until they learn about Bitcoin. Most of these are scams and you should be familiar with the basics first. Bitcoin is referred to as BTC or XBT.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nExchanges Requiring ID Verification\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nBitcoin = BTC or XBT on exchanges\n\n  Exchange | Buy fee* | Withdraw BTC | Notes\n---|---|----|----\n[Cash App](https://cash.app) | Sliding ~1% to 3% | 0 BTC | Instant Withdraw, USA only\n[Coinbase](https://coinbase.com)| 1%  | 0.3-3USD |~7Day hold on withdrawing Bitcoin for ACH deposit\n[CoinbasePro](https://pro.coinbase.com) [/ Advanced trader](https://www.coinbase.com/advanced-trade)| 0.6% taker 0.4% maker | 0.3-3USD | ~7Day hold on withdrawing Bitcoin or \u20ac0.15 EUR SEPA fee\n[Gemini](https://Gemini.com) | 1.49% over 200usd for web | 0 BTC | \n[Gemini Active trader](https://Gemini.com) | 0.35% Taker 0.25% maker,0.1% API | 0 BTC | 10 free BTC withdraws\n[Kraken](https://Kraken.com) | 0.16% | 0.00002 BTC or Free LN | Deposit Fiat=USwire+5USD or SEPA free\n[Bitstamp](https://Bitstamp.com) | 0.50% | 0.0005 BTC | Deposit Fiat=0 SEPA or 5% card fee\n[Swan](https://swanbitcoin.com) | 0.99% to 2.29% | 0 | Fees decrease based upon buying plan\n[Coincorner](https://coincorner.com) | 1% for over 300 | 0 or Variable  | UK exchange, 2.5% for card/free uk bank deposit \n\nNote: Exchanges all have unique market prices and spreads so fees alone will not tell you the best rates. Best way is to directly compare the rates between exchanges. Buy fees above are for normal trading volumes. Verification and hold times can vary based upon lack of history, verification level or credit.\n\nDuring bull markets when exchanges are extra busy it is normal to see very slow and poor customer support due to the amount of new clients and support tickets. We see many complaints due to this across all these exchanges.

                    "response": "----------------------------------\n\n**Some foundational Principles of security**\n\nIf you don't own much value in Bitcoin these principles are not for you. There is no one solution and most people have different risk profiles and make multiple trade offs in a risk vs convenience spectrum. \n\n1) **Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**\n\n2) Do not trust strangers on the Internet to help you setup your personal wallet. This is someone you must do yourself or have a personal friend or family member help you with in real life where they cannot see your backup seed. \n\n3) Buy your hardware wallet directly from the producer or amazon site under the producers name. Verify the integrity of the hardware wallet if you are extra paranoid :\n\nhttps://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002481534-Check-if-device-is-genuine\n\nhttps://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019352834-Check-hardware-integrity\n\nhttp://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-faq/threats.html#reflashing-the-trezor-with-evil-firmware\n\nhttps://digitalbitbox.com/faq\n\nFirst update the firmware of your HW wallet before using\n\n4) Never brag about your wealth to others \n\n5) Never invest in any investment scheme or get greedy thinking you can quickly increase the amount of Bitcoin you have with daytrading\n\n6) Consider more secure means of backing up your 12 or 24 BIP39 backups in case of floods or fire -  \nhttps://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/\n\n7) Setup your hardware wallet , transfer a small amount of btc to it, wipe it clean , and restore it to give you confidence that the backup was done right and give you experience in the recovery process.\n\n8) Keep your Mnemonic 12 or 24 word seed secret and private and show to no one.  Never use premade 12-24 word backups , you create new keys and backups upon setup. \n\n9) The most secure , \"active\" wallet would be a hardware wallet integrated with a full node\nHW wallet + electrum personal server and electrum is the popular way to do this\n\n10) \nUse a passphrase with the hardware wallet (most the security concerns with HW wallets are solved with a passphrase.) keep the passphrase written down a separate from your seed words\nhttps://wiki.trezor.io/Passphrase\n\nhttps://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005214529-Advanced-passphrase-security\n\nhttps://coldcardwallet.com/docs/passphrase\n\nMake sure the passphrase is also written down somewhere private so you do not forget it! Do not keep the passphrase in the same location as your 12-24 seed backup words.\n\nHere is a good strategy for most people with hardware wallets -\n\n**Location 1** 12 to 24 seed words preferably on metal\n\nhttps://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/\n\n**Location 2** same 12 to 24 seed words\n\n**Location 3** 4-6 word passphrase unlocking your real wallet\n\n**Location your head** pin for HW wallet and passphrase\n\nThus you have both the passphrase and seed word backup in 2 locations and can lose either one and if someone finds your seed words or passphrase alone they can only see your decoy wallet at most and under duress(torture) you can hand over one of your seed word backups or enter in your pin instead of passphrase and give the attacker your decoy wallet alone.\n\nEvery 6 months check to see if your backup seed words or passphrase written on paper or metal is disturbed or removed.(these need to be stored separately!) It is best to hide them in such a manner if you can tell if someone has tampered with them or found them so you are aware if either your seed words or passphrase becomes compromised.\n\n\n-------------------------",

                    "response": "This subreddit is not a place where companies can promote services or products as we desire to limit biased responses. BitcoinBeginners is a place where new users can openly ask questions and peer review can occur. It is critically important that discussion occurs in the open to insure multiple perspectives and peer review because everyone can make a mistake including the moderators. Concern trolling or aggressive debating is not allowed here but honest corrections or clarification is welcome as long as it relates to Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nSince bitcoin is a secure digital bearer asset where transactions are usually non reversible con artists prefer to target people interested in cryptocurrency. One technique they prefer using is to isolate the victim with a private conversation in direct message, email, or directing you to their private website, subreddit, or platform such as their discord server. They do this because they don't want others warning you that their business or investment proposal is a scam. The best advice is not to respond to them and block them as there is no need to ask questions in private and if you do, it is you who should always be the one initiating the conversation.\n\n--------------------------\n\n**Common types of Scams to avoid**\n\n--------------------------\n\n**\"Helping\" Hand** A thief will contact you privately by DM or email, or get listed in a directory as a \"Professional Blockchain Expert\" and help you setup a Bitcoin wallet , an exchange account, and buy Bitcoin but will end up stealing it later. One of their favorite wallets to use is Blockchain.com online web wallet(You should avoid using this wallet regardless for other reasons) where they can remotely help you. They will either ask for your 12 backup seed words or when you are logged in create another backdoor recovery to take over your wallet without you knowing. **When setting up a wallet it is important that you do this yourself and never reveal any passwords , pins , passphrases, of backup seed words to anyone.** Do not allow some stranger to remotely help you setup your wallet or account. If you need help in person and trust a family member or friend this is fine but have them walk away/turn their head when you create a password , and write down your backup seed words and never reveal this information to others. Use your own personal computer or cellphone and not theirs to create your account. After you have verified the backup words with the wallet software they can than help you further. Never allow them to see or copy your exchange or email passwords or backup authy/authenticator key as well. **Do not keep your passwords in plaintext digital spreadsheets or word/text documents. Use a password manager like keepass/lastpass or at minimum keep a book of your passwords that is secure and privately written down outside the computer.** This scam can also manifest itself after you have had your BTC stolen by a friendly \"hacker\" claiming they can recover your BTC for a modest fee, which is practically never the case. \n\n--------------------------\n\n**Unfortunate Events** Professional Beggars will create many posts or hundreds of DMs under various fake (shill) identities to solicit sympathy and ask for a Bitcoin donations because they were scammed or had some unfortunate crisis. \n\n--------------------------\n\n**Advanced Fee Fraud-**  This is one of the most common forms of fraud, and is popular even outside the cryptocurrency ecosystem. With cryptocurrency it often takes to form of these variations:\n\n**a)** The con artist will claim they have a large amount of Bitcoin \"stuck\" in an exchange because of legal reasons or some other excuse and need your assistance to withdraw the Bitcoin. They offer you their username and password to log into their account and claim that you can even keep a large reward and than send them the difference of Bitcoins to their personal wallet. When you login to withdraw the Bitcoin you will notice a high withdraw fee or deposit that needs to be made for verification  before you are allowed to withdraw the Bitcoin that cannot be subtracted from the balance. Since the fee is much less than your expected reward and the exchange looks legitimate despite being one you are unfamiliar with you pay the fee and than realize that the exchange is a fake one that will never allow you to withdraw the Bitcoin. \n\n**b)** You are trying to sell something online and someone offers you a pre-payment in fiat with a payment service, a cashiers check,  or a regular check and than \"accidentally\" overpays and asks for a refund to be sent to them in Bitcoin or by other methods. You are confident you receive the money because you deposit the check and it appears to clear and shows up in your bank account or digitally shows in your paypal account or other platform and so you are happy to send them the difference in over payment. One key aspect is international money transfers, gift card payments, or Bitcoin are typically non-reversible while most other payments are reversible and this can occur at almost anytime in the future. The check or payment can be involved in fraud or be fake and the payment platform or bank will reverse the deposit(possibly leaving you with a negative balance) and you will be legally liable to reimburse the bank. You will than be left with having to reimburse the bank and be out of Bitcoin and the product you sold the scammer. \n\n**c)** A company offers you an investment or mining opportunity and to gain your trust is even willing to send you some Bitcoin up front to gain your confidence. Problem is the Bitcoin is frozen in their platform , a watch only wallet, represented in a fake blockchain explorer, or you did not wait for a confirmation to insure that you can use it and you invest in them not knowing that the Bitcoin they sent you is unusable. Common scam here is saying that you can connect your blockchain.com wallet to their \"mining server\" to mine for free and than require you to pay a fee to withdraw BTC that is watch only because they setup your account for you. \n\n**d)** A contest or free giveaway usually promoted by a celebrity(typically a fake account on twitter) offers you free Bitcoin or cryptocurrency if you make a small bitcoin deposit up front to enter. The grifter will take your BTC and run.\n\n**e)** A company solicits to hire you for assistance in buying Bitcoin for them at various ATMs or with your account and offers a salary for this service. They will never pay you or send checks that will eventually bounce as fiat currency lacks transaction finality that bitcoin has. \n\n\n--------------------------\n\n**Investment Opportunity-** These take the form of a company that allows you to make an investment and has promised guaranteed returns due to them trading cryptocurrency, mining cryptocurrency, fx or binary option trading,  or any other investment enterprise such as real estate. Some will simply take your Bitcoin and run and others are ponzi schemes which will slowly payout rewards to their platform that you can never withdraw or make payouts but these never add up to your total investment.\n\nTwo quickest warning signs that an investment scheme is extremely likely to be a scam is they promise guaranteed returns , and their promised returns exceed 10% per year.\n\n--------------------------\n\n**Altcoins, ICOs, Security tokens** 99% of these are pointless projects or scams which make dishonest marketing claims that most people don't have the technical ability to evaluate. Even projects that have the best of intentions fail because the incentives are all misaligned for an exit when you give 100% funding upfront without regulation, contract with preconditions, and invested from unqualified credulous investors. Sticking to projects that are 100% proof of work with no premine or instamine from the start is a way to filter through most of these projects but in the end you should do your due diligence and learn about the project before investing. This applies to Bitcoin as well. People should be free to invest in whatever project they wish but one should do so with an understanding in what they are investing in.",

Do not respond to strangers direct messaging you, as over 99% of these people are Scammers. This subreddit allows open discussion where peer review occurs.\n\n/r/BitcoinBeginners is not for posting new websites, memes, faucets, affiliate links, news, concern trolling, blog articles, or promoting altcoins and ICOs. **Bitcoin related Questions only** Altcoin questions and discussion are not allowed.\n\nDo not solicit private buying or selling Bitcoin, altcoins, or ICOs here.\n\nDo not solicit people to Private message/DM you in private.\n\nDo not solicit forex trading, cloud mining, managed broker trading, options trading in posts or DM with users here.\n\nOnly specific/technical questions and answers that are relevant to beginners, no debating and opinions\n\nPrice Prediction and general daytrading TA questions may be removed as well\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Cloud Mining Contracts** Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees which mean you will never ROI. Cloud mining typically falls into 3 categories\n\n**a)**\tlegit mining company that actually mines what you invest, but is misleading to clients the harsh reality of hashing difficulty increasing and fees = You will not profit and not make a ROI\n\n**b)**\tCloudmining company that fractionally reserve mines to keep up appearances and prove they actually are doing some mining but in reality do not mine the hashrate that they are contractually obligated to = You will not profit and not make a ROI\n\n**c)** Straight up ponzi scheme with no mining = You will not profit and not make a ROI\nMining is very competitive and if miners need to both pay for marketing, profit sharing , affiliate revenue, and management of many small clients or partners this overhead will quickly drive them out of business.\nKeep in mind that BTC mining difficulty is typically increasing , which means the payouts are fine initially but than naturally get smaller and smaller as the months go on. So at first everything seems fine than you notice later you start to get less and less until there is no payout.\n\nSo people that cloud mine either come away from the experience bitter and don't return , or they make a profit , but not from mining but from the appreciation of Bitcoin during their contract. I.E... They invest 500 USD , cloud mining company pays back 300 USd of BTC over the next year , but because Bitcoin appreciated in value that BTC is now worth 800 dollars and the client is happy because they don't have the know how to compare what that investment would be worth if they simply sat on it and waited for their bitcoin to appreciate in value.\n\n--------------------------\n\n**Escrow Disputes**  \n\na) You purchase something digital on an escrow platform like a digital giftcard or another digital item instead of receiving your physical product before releasing your escrowed BTC. After releasing the BTC they sweep the funds from the gift card .  With these types of services only buy physical items you can inspect.\n\nb) They attempt to communicate with you with another service like whatsapp or discord or email off the normal communication channels within the escrow service making it harder for the escrow agent to investigate any claims\n\nc) They convince you to save money and not use escrow and simply do the trade in private, thus removing your ability to make a dispute\n\n--------------------------\n\n**Arbitrage Fraud**  \n\nThe scammer promotes a great opportunity to perform arbitrage between 2 exchanges that have a different marketprice. One of the exchanges is well know and the other one is a new exchange they created to steal your money when you attempt to make thousands of dollars in an arbitrage trade.\n\n--------------------------\n\n**Double Spend Theft** \n\nMerchant sells an item or user trades their fiat for BTC where the attacker uses a very low transaction fee and than later replaces the transaction before a confirmation is received onchain(with a lightning transaction confirmations are instant) and than the attacker double spends the transaction to recover the BTC and keep the Bitcoin and fiat or personal item. 0 confirmation attacks are typically only is effective in person or with digital items because the merchant can usually detect this attack before shipment. If you accept 0 confirmation transactions from strangers instead of confirmed or lightning transactions, than at least use a merchant processor as they have tools to at least detect and reduce these attacks.",

What would you say to a newbie, what will be your advice to them?   \n \n\nI would probably say to them how data protection is SO important so they should find some suitable blockchain solution, Modex is quite cool and it's present since the Blockchain appeared, so it could be trustworthy.    \n \n\nWhen it comes to crypto wallets, there are plenty of bitcoin wallets available on the App Store and Google Play, making it difficult to select the correct one. Just be sure to read the reviews and research the wallets before deciding on one.   \n \n\nJust research, research, research, and be free to ask million times if it's necessary and make sure to protect your data.

I honestly don't even understand what it really is that well, but I figured I would be very interested in this type of stuff. Anyways, I've been programming since my freshman year and I've done a bit of web development and machine learning. I'm pretty solid with the fundamentals of programming. \n\nDo you guys have any tips on where I should start and how I should approach this field as a high schooler? Are there any good tutorials to learn blockchain programming that you guys would suggest? \n\nThanks in advance!",

I understand the public key is used as the address, but then there also has to be some network address that this is sent to correct, otherwise how does the network know where this address is located on the physical network ?\n\n2 - Thinking about the above question, i thought maybe there is nothing ever sent to any wallet anywhere, and the bitcoin or transaction is encoded with the public key of the receiver so only they can then spend that amount later on, i.e take ownership of it. Is this correct, or is there something actually in your wallet, which you then use to spend ?\n\nI have a vague understanding that the wallet is just for the purpose of creating and storing the public/private key pair, and no crypto is actually stored in the wallet. Is this correct ?",

It's just a string of text with built in rules about whether a transaction trying to spend funds associated with that address is valid or not.\n\nSPV wallets just get notified about balances currently at that wallet's addresses, so while they do sort of \"receive\" the transaction, they're really just \"finding out\" about it. (And your wallet has to request it, the transaction information doesn't automatically seek out your wallet on the internet.)\n\nBut since the device your wallet is on (your phone, computer, or whatever) is the only place where the private keys that were used to create the public keys are stored, only that device can cryptographically sign transactions that try to spend the funds at those addresses.",

                    "response": ">When receiving a transaction, how does the network know where the wallet is located to send the bitcoin to ?\n\nWhen you send a transaction you broadcast it to all nodes that peer it among themselves and if the transaction is valid they add it to their mempool. This usually happens in less than 1 second. If you run a full node you see the transaction that gets added to your local mempool , if you run a light wallet you see the transaction that gets added to the full node mempool you are connected to. \n\nThis is why you can see the transaction instantly even if it has not been added to the blockchain by miners who confirm it (as opposed to all full nodes that validate , most of them not in control of miners). \n\nIf the transaction is onchain it shows in the wallet as 0 confirmations  until it gets added to the blockchain. If you are using a bitcoin lightning wallet the transaction is both validated and confirmed instantly with no wait . \n\n>understand the public key is used as the address,\n\nThis is a common misunderstanding. You don't share public keys with others . public keys are used within wallets to simply create bitcoin addresses that you than share with others \n\n>some network address that this is sent to correct\n\nyou give out the address to others to pay you \n\n--------------------\n\n> i thought maybe there is nothing ever sent to any wallet anywhere,\n\nTechnically bitcoin are not sent from wallet A to wallet B . Bitcoin ownership are changed on the blockchain where wallet A private keys no longer control ownership after the transaction is validated and confirmed and wallet B private keys than control ownership to sign or send those UTXOs\n\nBitcoins = UTXOs(Unspent transaction outputs) on the blockchain\n\n>and no crypto is actually stored in the wallet.\n\nCorrect from a technical perspective and here is where is gets even more interesting: Bitcoin (UTXOs) are not stored in \"accounts\" or \"addresses\" . An \"address\" is merely an attribute of the UTXO and you do not send bitcoin from an \"address\" but by \"sending\" the bitcoin you can change the address attribute once the transaction is confirmed. This may seem like a subtle distinction but an important one for at least developers to understand or people who try and use legacy paper wallets to understand. \n\nFurther explanation :\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/s5apqz/why_the_following_terms_are_incorrect/",

                    "response": ">And I trust the internet.\n\nYikes. Please be very skeptical and trust your judgement after fact checking from multiple sources. I think you might just be saying this in jest though. \n\nstart by reading the pinned FAQ-\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/g42ijd/faq_for_beginners/\n\n>Also im only 18 and have about a 100 bucks. \n\n Here is some general advice.\n\n1)\tDo you have high interest debt (5% and higher) and no savings?\n\nIf the answer is Yes - Do not invest in any Bitcoin. (you can use bitcoin to save money but don't speculate with it as an investment)\n\n2)\tDo you have any credit card debt and fiat savings?\n\nIf the answer is Yes ,than at minimum pay off all your credit card debt with fiat savings unless you are in debt to such a degree and plan on filing bankruptcy. Do not invest in Bitcoin until you have paid off all high interest debt\n\n3)\tHave a lot of low interest credit card debt (below 5%) and no fiat savings?\n\nYou should make a budget , cut expenses, and simultaneously start paying off your debt(unless you plan to file chapter 7 bankruptcy) , start saving a fiat emergency fund, and start buying Bitcoin.\n\n4)\tHave no debt and no fiat savings?\n\nYou should make a budget , cut expenses, start simultaneously saving for 6-12 months worth of living expenses in fiat emergency fund (only stable forms of fiat, obviously not the Argentinian peso or Venezuelan bolivar) and invest in Bitcoin, and seriously consider investing in stocks(preferable an index fund ETF like SPDR) or a IRA.\n\n5) You have a large amount of fiat savings and no debt and want to know if its best to dollar cost average invest or invest it all immediately?\n\nThe answer almost always is to make a plan and invest 100% of the fiat (not including your emergency fund) immediately in a diversified portfolio of investments that are non correlated (land, stocks, Bitcoin, businesses with positive cash flow) . It is often impossible to time the market and those that invest earlier will gain the most compound interest. The reason why dollar cost average investment is popular and a fine strategy is merely because most people don't have a large amount of fiat to invest upfront so invest a little each time they are paid.\n\nHere is a useful tool for you - https://dcabtc.com\n\nThus if you get paid twice a month than what you should do is buy some Bitcoin immediately twice a month and also in addition set buy limit orders on an exchange for 5-10% below spot price. If those orders do not get filled by  the following paycheck than buy your set amount and reset the buy limit orders for 5-10% below spot price from the current market price.\nThe reason for this is 2 fold:\n\n1)\tyou can auto pickup savings with BTC volatility on the dips which is psychologically rewarding\n\n2)\tIf a large amount of people create large amounts of Buy limit support than BTC becomes more stable unit of account and more liquid leading to more investor confidence and making BTC more of a currency(less volatility = better unit of account) and thus increases the likelihood your investment will continue appreciating in value.\n\n\nThe reason having a fiat savings account is so important is it not only will it save you if you lose a job or have an unexpected car expense or medical bill, but that it makes you a more rational investor that is less stressed out by the volatility in your more risky investments like Bitcoin. Bitcoin historically has had at least 2 bear markets lasting a little over 1 year thus you need to be prepared to not be forced to sell at a loss for at least 2 years to give yourself enough of a buffer.\n\nYou can use Bitcoin to help you save money as well and than use that money to invest in more stocks/bitcoin\n\nSpend and Replace -\n\nHere are some helpful sites -\n\nhttp://ln.pizza  - save 6 % off dominoes Pizza in the USA with lightning wallet\n\nhttps://purse.io  Save 10-20% off amazon \n\nhttps://foldapp.com - save up to 20%  Starbucks, Uber, Target , whole foods , Dunkin \n\nhttps://www.lolli.com \u2013 save up to 30% by spending BTC anywhere but primarily USA stores\n\nhttps://stekking.com - save up to 20% by spending BTC anywhere but primarily Europe stores",

To an outsider looking at a blockchain they cannot identify that the addresses all belong to the same wallet unless the user combines those UTXOs together. If someone sends them some dust to an old address now they have at least 2 UTXOs associated with that address. They can spend the UTXOs separately , but if they don't use coin control than its possible the wallet selects the dust from address A , with another UTXO from address B and than the attacker knows that Address A and address B are in the same wallet.",

I still have a monthly savings plan S&P 500 ETF for retirement, this is just an alternative asset class to me. I think that a weekly savings plan over many years is the most comfortable and healthy option instead of buying like 1 bitcoin for $40k and hope for the best. Sometimes you get more, sometimes you get less, just like an S&P 500 ETF savings plan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong version:\n\n1. Have been using Coinbase for a while and buy bitcoin here and there with small amounts. Coinbase fees are a bit high, so I was wondering if anyone has a recommendation for a crypto exchange where you can cheaply and idiot-proof just do a bitcoin savings plan on a weekly basis and which is cheaper than Coinbase?\n2. Since I simply want to have an investment horizon of at least 10 to 20 years, I would like to transfer Bitcoin from the crypto exchange to a hardware wallet. Since these are my own wallets, shouldn't there be any taxes here, no matter how many times I transfer to this hardware wallet? I would capture everything with screenshots and Excel spreadsheets. Or how do you document your transactions? Can anyone recommend a good hardware wallet? So paper wallets are nonsense?\n3. A question I'm still unsure about: Such hardware wallets are independent of the Internet, aren't they? But what if, for example, [Ledger.com](https://Ledger.com) eventually goes bankrupt and their app/website is offline? You still can\u2019t get to the Bitcoin because the hardware wallet only works with the [Ledger.com](https://Ledger.com) website?\n4. Maybe someone has another solutions, suggestions, recommendations or thoughts as far as Bitcoin and long-term investment horizons are concerned? Do you still invest in other cryptocurrencies on a long-term basis?\n\nThe problem is always the long-term and life expectancy. Thanks to the crypto experts, especially from people who also invest in Bitcoin long-term and just hodl and want to store it armageddon-proof.",

You create this \"paper\" or metal wallet with a hardware wallet. \n\n>A question I'm still unsure about: Such hardware wallets are independent of the Internet, aren't they?\n\nMost hardware wallets are used connected to the internet so should be considered as \"warm wallets\". They isolate the private key creation , storage , and tx signing so they are better than just using a software wallet alone however \n\n> Ledger.com eventually goes bankrupt and their app/website is offline? \n\nI would avoid that hardware wallet but most hardware wallets use standard BIP39 backups so can be used with other hardware or software wallets . It doesn't matter if the company disappears\n\n>?You still can\u2019t get to the Bitcoin because the hardware wallet only works with the Ledger.com website?\n\nThats not how hardware wallets work , you aren't forced to use trezor suite or ledger live . You can use hardware wallets with many independent software wallets \n\n> Do you still invest in other cryptocurrencies on a long-term basis?\n\n99% of altcoins are scams (not all are) but this is offtopic here\n\n>The problem is always the long-term and life expectancy\n\nThan just stick with bitcoin , because most altcoins will disappear or lose 99.9% of their value and are just pump and dumps",

                    "response": "https://armantheparman.com/why-bitcoin-only/\n\nI want to start by stressing that it all comes down to scarcity. Without scarcity, cryptocurrency may as well be fiat. Good money is scarce. The biggest weakness of cryptocurrencies is that they can be created easily from nothing. All alts are like this. But Bitcoin is different. It has miraculously been born and has gained a huge lead in network effects. This can not be copied. Thus, it has gained scarcity. It is extremely decentralised, and has by far the greatest hashing power on the planet, and distribution of full nodes, which makes it not possible to tamper with the monetary policy. Bitcoin has scarcity due to network effect lead and \u201cun-tamper-ability\u201d.\n\nThe Lindy effect will only make it stronger as day after day it doesn\u2019t die. It can\u2019t be eradicated, just like a cancer that has spread too far.\n\nThe copies cannot compete with this. It needs the majority to not only leave Bitcoin, but mostly leave to the same choice. There are thousands of choices, so those few people that abandon Bitcoin will not all go to the same choice. In other words, defectors will disperse, not concentrate. The only way this could theoretically happen is if there is some fatal flaw with Bitcoin, AND it can\u2019t be fixed, AND an altcoin can, AND only one altcoin can.\n\nE.g. let\u2019s say Bitcoin\u2019s privacy weakness (really it\u2019s a trade off, not a weakness and any other coin with privacy just chooses a different trade off) is suddenly critical and everyone is exiting. Where will they go? Monero, Zcash, DASH, some to ETH and XRP (not private btw), Cardano\u2026. Can they all be money? Money printer go brrrr much?\n\nSo how else can an Altcoin take over? Remember that people will save in the best money. An Altcoin must become fundamentally better. In the open source world, how is that possible? It\u2019s like thinking it\u2019s possible for a better operating system to exist than the dominant open source one today (GNU Linux). The open source leader just gets better and better. All new ideas get absorbed.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine another currency finds a good use case. Let\u2019s say smart contracts. First that\u2019s like saying paper is money and valuable because contracts can be written on it. No, you need to make good money first, not find other uses for it. Aluminium has more uses than gold but it\u2019s less valuable because it is not money. It can\u2019t be money because it is not scarce. But even if smart contracts makes a cryptocurrency into good money, there are too many: ETH, Cardano, TRON, Iota, probably others.\n\nAs soon as any becomes valuable, it will invite competition and it will be copied. There is no scarcity. For goodness sake, ETH doesn\u2019t even work yet. Its Turing completeness is not even used. Bitcoin has smart contract capability and I understand nearly everything ETH is doing program-wise can be done with Bitcoin. Let\u2019s face it, it is competing with Bitcoin as a money and is far far behind and has no credibility. What will Vitalik Buterin do with the monetary policy next?\n\nETH is just another fiat with a central banker. That is not a true cryptocurrency. Remember why Bitcoin was born \u2013 we are fighting central banking and trying to separate money and state, not shoot ourselves in the foot by losing focus, trying to get rich by improving on the solution we already miraculously discovered. Bitcoin is that: a miracle \u2013 and we should embrace it.\n\nAlso, you mention ROI. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist so you can buy it and sell it for more fiat later. It is a REPLACEMENT for fiat. You buy and NEVER sell. You spend once it achieves its true value. You don\u2019t need an exit strategy. You just save in Bitcoin. With alts, you need to time your exit and sell to a greater fool, because alts are scams, holding forever will get you rekt. Just DCA Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s like picking up gold off the ground before anyone else realises it will become money. Don\u2019t pick up pebbles or seashells (alts), your pockets have limited space. Finally, the most important problem to solve is separating money and state. All other problems are tiny in comparison. We don\u2019t need to replace the legal system with smart contracts. We don\u2019t need a token for everything. We don\u2019t need to put bananas on a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is an invention that solves a humanitarian problem. Altcoins take a solution (blockchain) and try to find a problem. Remember that.",

That is, given a valid signature for a transaction I can change it slightly to produce a slightly different valid signature for that same transaction. This isn\u2019t forgery as the valid transaction was already signed, but causes problems because it changes the hash of the transaction slightly. This is why we call the transaction malleable.\n\nLightning requires that a user watch the blockchain to see if your counterparts published a malicious transaction which closes the channel. Without segwit you would basically have to scan every block for this malicious transaction, possible but still a lot harder than scanning the blockchain for a transaction of a specific hash. It\u2019s not impossible without segwit, just a lot more annoying.",

                    "response": "Not really a beginner question, and in fact Lightning does not strictly need SegWit, but it could be inconvenient to use Lightning without SegWit  \n\nSegWit is primarily a solution to one of the transaction malleability problems. A Bitcoin signature exploits the discrete logarithm trapdoor function to be securely verifiable, using an elliptic curve. Elliptic curves are symmetrical about the X-axis. Mathematically, this means that there are two valid signatures for any combination of key-pair and message, each one a mirror of the other. One is positive (above the X-axis), the other is negative  \n\nMany Bitcoin processes rely on the SHA2-256 hash of the transaction being used as the txID  \n\nMalleability:  \nAfter receiving an unconfirmed transaction, a node, or a miner, can modify the sign (plus or minus) of one or more of the transaction's input signatures. The signatures are still valid. But the txID hash has changed. Now, some nodes have the original and some nodes have the malleated transaction. The original transaction and the malleated transaction are functionally identical, but have different txID hashes  \n\nIn the early Bitcoin years, malleability was used to defraud Bitcoin recipients who relied on the txID and zero confirmation. After being confirmed in a block, the transaction is immutable. Malleability is only a problem for the processing of unconfirmed transactions by wallets and users  \n\nSegWit fixes malleability  \nSegWit separates the witness data (input signature) from the transaction input. The witness data is not part of the data which is hashed to create the txID. In a SegWit transaction, if someone flips the sign of the signature, the txID remains the same  \n\nLightning  \nLightning channel close transactions are created and signed whenever there is a change to the channel state, and then they're stored on the two nodes at each end of the channel. Later, when the nodes agree to close the channel, the transaction representing the latest channel state is broadcast to the network. The maintenance of these signed future-use transactions relies on the transactions having a consistent txID hash  \n\nSegWit is not essential to Lightning, because transaction malleability is a low risk in the Lightning context  \n\nhttps://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/69317/why-was-transaction-malleability-fix-required-for-lightning-network  \n\nEspecially:  \n\n> The great thing about segwit is that it protects from both Bob signing with a different nonce (changing the signature completely) and a 3rd party changing the s specifically\n\nand\n\n> Additionally, segwit solves another problem. For non-segwit transactions, the transaction id (txid) can only be calculated after a transaction is signed. Hence, a commitment transaction that allows fund recovery could only be constructed after the funding transaction was already fully committed to. Since the witness does not contribute to the txid of segwit transactions, funding a channel from segwit funds simplifies the exchange of information for the construction of commitment transactions\n\nLess detail  \nhttps://medium.com/lightningto-me/bitcoin-transactions-malleability-segwit-and-scaling-258af8ed9cbf",

Outside of this, I have limited savings and little to no generational wealth, so I'd like to make the best of it as I responsibly can. What would you do?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT(s):\n\nThank you so much for the advice and links everyone! I will be learning a lot in the coming days, weeks, months. I will also go ahead and leave this account/post up so I can share any interesting updates on this journey.\n\nI chose not to share how I \"received\" this bitcoin because it is a gift from a trusted family member. This family member was lucky enough to invest very early, and I am lucky enough to benefit from that as there is no other potential source of generational wealth in our family. I asked that they hold it until I set up my own wallet, of which I will be the sole key holder. We are in the process of working through this exchange now.\n\nI see some folks concerned about my finances in general- \"Limited savings\" does mean 6+ months of living expenses, thankfully! Sorry if this was not clear. My general perception is that most folks holding 1 BTC have much more wealth than I do. I mentioned this because I wanted to make it clear that I have less capacity for risk than that. In the fewest words my main financial concerns are high cost of living, thriving versus surviving in providing for myself + my partner, and the hope to retire someday.",

The increased demand for shares as well as the reduced supply would cause the price to rise until there is no more discount. In reality however, the discount would evaporate very quickly simply because of the possibility of this arbitrage.\n\nAs you mentioned, ETFs generally have a small premium or discount.

Is it simply a function of encouraging hash difficulty so the network is better protected against attack?\n\nAppreciate any input",

Fiat currency and PoS coins cost at least the same amount of resources to  create , regulate and secure as Bitcoin.\n\nThere is an inescapable reality for any asset or currency that as it increases in value the production costs and costs to secure increase as well . This is demonstrated in the economic axiom: MC=MR\n\n\u201cRent\u201d always forces production costs (MC) to always equal sale prices (MR)\n\nPoS currencies and fiat are simply more abstract and complex forms or Proof of Work that use more human involvement (which uses tremendous amounts of resources and has a tremendous environmental impact) as a PoW coin like Bitcoin. Humans instead of ASICs are shouldering more of the work to create, regulate , and secure each of those currencies; This is \"work\" whether it involves burning electricity directly or food and electricity that humans consume  to perform their work. This is an inescapable economic reality. The more valuable something is the more it will cost to secure it because the more effort will be made to steal and or control it. This applies to any currency or asset.\n\nThis is also better understood with the dollar auction dilemma. In a hypothetical auction where a bidding war is fighting over the right to mint a 1 dollar bill how much do you think people will be willing to spend for this power ?\n\n>natural longest chain PoS protocol with similar predictability \n\nThis is untrue.

People who have billions can go and spend fairly liberally while hoarding their billions in bitcoin without the penalty of inflation. They are not incentivized to put their money back into the system to generate more value for the world.\n\nThat would mean that we would need another coin that can prove to have a constant slight inflation by constantly producing a bit more.\n\nWe would also need to make it impossible for this to be bypassed, i.e. government mass printing. This way everyone can have high confidence in the currency holding it's value. \n\nI am new to crypto so there may be things that address this already that I don't know about, but deflationary currency seems like a really bad idea.

Efficiency, conscientiousness, discipline- pretty much the traits that lead to all existential advancements. Right now there is no incentive to save dollars because we know it will only lose value.  Also, the depreciating dollar is constantly pulling the rug out from anyone who is economically marginalized and trying to get an economic foothold so they can better their life. An appreciating currency rewards saving, and takes the power of economic social control away from the central banks who print money and give it to their friends for free at the expense of the masses. And eventually, whether in retirement or otherwise, people will sell whatever assets they have (unless they take loans against it) which will move the asset back into circulation (if we consider an appreciating currency an asset).  Thinking about an appreciating unit of currency vs. a depreciating unit of currency does require a fundamental shift in the way you conceptualize money, and how that money shapes thought and society.",

During period of high deflation(appreciation) tx velocity tends to increase and merchant processors actually see an increase in spending for goods and services and charitable giving in Bitcoin.\n\nThis is believed to be caused by the feeling of newfound wealth(because they are wealthier) eventually overrides their desire to \"hoard\" (when did savings become a negative thing?) their Bitcoin.\n\nOf course more data needs to confirm this and as we enter another bull cycle(rapid deflation) it looks like we will get another round of data to confirm this.\n\nBitcoin is already testing some economic theories and proving them somewhat inaccurate but the data gathering is far from over and we all have a lot to learn .\nI personally suspect that what matters for a viable currency besides these other properties discussed here\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/gnzeeo/will_bitcoin_ever_be_adopted_by_the_general_public/frcry8f/\n\nIs stability and thus either low and predictable inflation or low and predictable deflation (1-4%) can both be suitable. As Bitcoins market cap grows and monetary inflation drops it appears that we will likely see very low deflation (occasionally people losing some coins) which is perfectly fine because the market will factor those expectations into consideration for loans and debt.\n________________________________________\nI personally prefer slight deflation for these reasons :\n\n1)\tEncourages people to invest in things they really need instead of unnecessary fluff and short term desires which is good for society and the environment\n\n2)\tencourages more savings instead of debt slavery which removes choice, confidence and power away from individuals\n\n\n3)\tkeeps fiat currency in check where too much inflation will cause more capital flight to Bitcoin and prevents corrupt governments from abusing the backdoor tax of inflation\n\n4) Reduces the negative cantillon effect of fiat by removing some of the control over currency from a small group of people that is in part due to fiat being inflationary\nhttps://fee.org/articles/the-cantillon-effect-because-of-inflation-we-re-financing-the-financiers/",

Install an open source wallet on your phone (after doing your due diligence, there are a few recommendations like blue wallet)\n2. Transfer your btc to the wallet\n3. Write down on paper your recovery phrase\n4. Delete the wallet from your phone. So you are no longer carrying direct access to your entire btc stash around with you wherever you go\n5. Your btc is stored on the blockchain, just as it is stored on the blockchain with a hardware wallet\n6. If you ever need your coins you install a good open source wallet again on your phone, or computer, or wherever, and viola you have access\n\nWhat exactly is the advantage of using a hardware wallet over this specific scenario I outlined above?\n\nThanks guys",

                                    "response": "> I know it would be a guess but where do you see the price of bitcoin in 10 years?\n\nBitcoin is in the very early days of adoption with 2% adoption globally so can grow much larger in the future\n\nNone of us knows the perfect time to invest or can predict the price . The intelligentsia of the market is the combined knowledge of all humans and algorithms which is more than knowledge than anyone can have. Also bitcoin is so scarce that a single wealthy investor can significantly move the market in secret and unannounced.\nRather than trying to time the market , let time work for you.\n\n**Time in the market will tend to beat timing the market**\n\n\nI don't care much about the price , but consider the following 2 aspects in growing my savings of BTC-\n\n1) Is Bitcoin still following its key principles and working? \n\n2) Is it before 2029 (7 years from now), thereafter I might consider taking profits off previous investments \n\nPersonally even if BTC is 1 million dollars a coin I will still be accumulating because the following -\n\nI believe Bitcoin is going to be over 1 million USD per BTC in value in the future. When this will occur , I have no idea.  Around 2-4 million BTC have been permanently lost or burnt. This means that you have around 15 million to 17 million BTC will be fought over in the next few years , but many Bitcoin users are long term hodlers so at least half of those BTC are trapped in their savings. Thus you have a situation where 7-8 million BTC could potentially be purchased with ~2755 Billionaires in the world and at least ~56 million millionaires. If even a small percentage of these wealthy investors wanted to hedge 1-5% of their portfolio in Bitcoin they couldn't without dramatically increasing the value of Bitcoin. These days it is actually dangerous not to have at least 5% exposure to Bitcoin because it is an uncorrelated asset class and one needs a balanced portfolio. This is how scarce Bitcoin is. \n \nRead this for more details - \n \nhttps://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1\n \n \nI have no plans on taking any profits(I am just going to spend and replace while keep increasing my BTC savings every year) for at least 7 years due to this. -\n \nWhy?\n \nThere is a generational change occurring with not only investing but preference in banking and currency usage. \n \nmillennial's and Generation Z grew up in the digital world and have little interest in investing in gold or silver and don't trust banks. People investing in gold and silver(or gold mining companies) I meet are typically in their late 40s or older. What is interesting about this shift is the key aspect of gold that these older gold bugs appreciate about their investment , being tangible and physical commodity that can be used and held physically , is the same thing that these 2 last generations reject and see as a burden or something that takes up space or inconvenient to store or secure.\n \nGeneration Y or Millennial's (born ~1982 to 2002) are now 37 to 17 and will begin to replace generation X as the new group with the greatest investing and spending capital (ages 45-54). This means in as little as 8 years you are going to start to see the transition of millennial into peak spending/investing ages and start to push out gen X who is more ambivalent/mixed to digital era. Baby boomers will be well into retirement and not be investing/spending and more living off their IRAs and pensions and their lack of familiarity and confidence of cryptocurrency will have little consequence. Thus in 8 years you will have gen Y enter their peak spending and investing and gen Z fill the next greatest category of spenders/investors(early career).\n \nThe other key takeaway is that these age groups also shift from not only spending more but investing more which is critical. Let\u2019s look at the breakdown averages in the USA-\n \n1) Less than 25 Years Old \u2013 $31,102 in spending (94.6%% of total income)\n \n2) Between 25-34 Years \u2013 $48,928 in spending (**70.8%** of total income)\n \n3) Between 45-54 Years \u2013 $64,781 in spending (**64.6%** of total income)\n \n4) Over 75 Years Old \u2013 $40,211 in spending (95.6% of total income)\n\nThese numbers represent spending and investing habits of different age demographics in the USA from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nhttps://www.visualcapitalist.com/how-americans-make-and-spend-their-money-by-age-group/\n\n\n \nNotice from 25 to 54 these individuals have the most money not only to spend but also to invest. Baby boomers retiring are spending almost all their income surviving (healthcare) and/or vacationing and no longer investing as much. Once gen Y and gen Z dominate these 2 age brackets than a heavy bias towards Bitcoin will occur.\n \nAnother issue is people and countries will start to transition away from gold in the future as a hedge \n \nIn 2026 Psyche will start reporting back to NASA the expected reality that there will a sudden hyper-inflationary spike in the volume of gold being mined in the near future\nhttps://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/psyche/\nSince psyche 16 asteroid represents an example of an asteroid that is a core of an early planet thus metallic and estimated to contain around $700 quintillion dollars of precious metals (gold, platinum, etc..) or 93 billion dollars of precious metals per person.\nWhile mining will not start immediately, the markets will start pricing in the expectation of mining and nation states will start to slowly sell their gold reserves if they are wise enough flooding the market with cheap gold.\nNation states will need an alternative asset to hedge against.\n\nFor the data showing you the shift in the last 2 generations perspectives read these - \n\nhttps://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/san2018-23.pdf\n\nhttps://perma.cc/6C7B-J5DD\n\nhttps://simplemoneylyfe.com/cryptocurrency-statistics/",

This is not merely an opinion but tested case law in the USA with the trendon shavers case. \n\n2) A similar amount of effort in securing the coin must be invested to be rewarded the coin creating long term incentives in the project and making it very costly to attack it. Miners who have sunk infrastructure costs on mining a particular algo, especially with ASICs\n\n3)  Fair Coin Distribution.  No scammy ICO , premine or instamine is created and miners are forced to sell most of their coins to cover the expense (mainly ASICs + electricity) which allows a fair distribution and competition in the minting process.\n\n4) Since mining BTC is so competitive, profit margins are typically thin and thus new entrants that either use a better tool to mine (ASIC) or find cheaper sources of power(typically green due to the economics) can quickly gain market share making lasting monopolies difficult. Even if a main ASIC manufacturer appears to have a large market share we can see this quickly change due to a single malinvestment or a mistake when developing the newest ASIC. Power is a resource that comes from many sources and allows many locations around the world to remain competitive for unique reasons. \n\n5) Objective Security- Proof of work gives us an objective and measurable degree of security where risk assessments can be made with greater precision that isn't afforded with more subjective forms of security.\n\n5)\tThere is no company that controls a pure PoW coin in many cases thus the project will win or fail on its own merit and doesn't have a long burn rate created by speculators\n\n6)\tOther means of consensus always devolve into centralization and corrupted like Proof of stake where those with the most money or rewarded themselves with the most premine automatically collects the most fees or miner rewards for no additional effort and thus a vicious cycle occurs where they become more and more powerful unlike with Bitcoin.",

Since most of this Bitcoin needs to be sold to cover miner costs you have 900 x 41k usd = ~36,900,000 usd worth of Bitcoin that needs to be purchased daily in order to keep the price of  Bitcoin stable . \n\nIn approximately 751 days - https://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/ the amount of Bitcoin per block will be cut in half to 450 new Bitcoin a day or only ~18,450,000 usd of bitcoin needs to support miners at todays current price. \n\nThis means :\n\n1) Bitcoin technically doesn't **necessarily** need new adoption to continue to grow in value . Current users buying and using bitcoin being steady means that Bitcoin will roughly double in price every 4 years. New adoption simply means bitcoin appreciates much faster \n\n2) The market prices in these expectations beforehand and thus Bitcoin might appreciate even before the next halving. The larger Bull market usually is delayed 6-12 months after the halving as scarcity sets in \n\n3) The halving creates a bull market cycle because there is a feedback loop created as the price continues to appreciate encouraging more investment and more adoption as the price goes up which is why you see Bitcoin grow to 5-20x in value in bull markets and not just double in value \n\n4) Since this is the very early adoption phase in bitcoin at ~2% global adoption bitcoin is likely going to remain volatile for at least 7 more years and still has much more room for growth",

Both derive their value subjectively from humans. Just because something is physical in nature doesn't mean that it has value to humans. Many physical things have negative value like trash that people pay others to take from them. Even very useful resources can sometimes have negative value like we saw with crude oil futures temporarily.\n\nhttps://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value\n\nAs for alternative use cases , Bitcoin has many as its a timestamping protocol, currency, store of value asset, payment rail, smart contract platform, decentralized messaging system.

A node is just you running the bitcoin protocol on your computer and participating in verifying transactions. A miner is a node that also confirms new transactions onto the ledger via a hashing algorithm called SHA-256. The nodes verify that these new transactions are legit, and if all are in agreement, a new block is created. \n\nConsensus across the nodes would be needed to change the protocol and it\u2019s not in the nodes and miners\u2019 best interests to do so because expanding the supply would cause the price to plummet. It\u2019s in the best interest of the miners to maintain the integrity of the protocol and not do something that would drop the price or their income would drop too.\n\nThat\u2019s essentially why the bitcoin network is so secure. At this stage, with how much hashing power there is in the network, it is next to impossible to be able to control a majority of the nodes and change the protocol to your liking. And even if you did, everyone could see that and could just ignore your malicious ledger.\n\nThis is discussed in detail in The Bitcoin Standard, I highly recommend the audiobook.",

This would result in a sharp decrease in the value of Bitcoin. Since the miners hold and mine Bitcoin, they are disincentivized to take such action.\n\nAlso, such action would likely result in a hard fork. Meaning that miners who chose not to adopt such code, would continue to run with the original 21M limit. At this point, people can elect which network they want to participate in. The one that doesn't dilute their holdings or the one that does. It's clear that very few would choose the inflationary network.",

If on the other hand, you believe that the exchange can take care of your coins better than you can (I prefer to have them in the exchange than in a hot wallet) you can diversify the risk of loss by having part in your hard wallet and part in the exchange, but then their security will not depend on you but on a third party, which is not necessarily wrong.   \n\n\n*\\*Just so as not to create misunderstandings, I would like to clarify that \"cryptocurrencies\" are in the blockchain, not in the hardware wallet. The hardware wallet holds the private keys that allow the use of those coins, not the coins themselves.*",

However, he isn't 18 yet and all of the trading apps he has tried require him to be 18. I'm also concerned that these apps need the last 4 digits of his social security number. It says it does this to prevent fraud which I understand, seeing as there isn't any government over cryptocurrencies. My final concern is that I have read online (and yes, I know it's not always the most trustworthy source) that you have to report cryptocurrency trading to the IRS.

Also, do you think it's worth the money and time to finish MSc in Blockchain, or you think its best to learn what you can online, and wait till you get a job in Crypto for further specialization. If it's the latter, do you think its important for Bachelor's degree student like me to even get a Master's degree (be it in Engineering or in Blockchain) or just study by myself until I find a job in this space?",

You can't expect each teacher to know everything. They are a collection of people whom can impart knowledge of their specific expertise onto the student.

                    "response": "Here it goes:\n\n* First you get a hard wallet. Preferably you want something that offers a duress PIN. I prefer Coldcards, which happen to be made in Canada. A duress PIN is for *plausible deniability*. If the duress PIN is provided for example, it will lead to a real wallet different than your actual wallet, which you made or may not choose to keep some BTC. This is for wrench attacks, dishonest border guards, or if a court compels you to open a device.\n* Next you MEMORIZE your seed. Why? Because, when you're in a high risk environment, you may have police show up to your bank with a warrant and gas tools. They may kick down your door. This means they may seize your hard wallet or metal stamped backups. Then how do you access your bitcoin? DO NOT STAMP OR WRITE DOWN YOUR SEED. They ever get that, it's over. The seed goes in your head, and on the hard wallet, or hard wallet's (plural), because you should clone these at least twice. Give one to a trusted third-party, keep one in the bank, and use the other one. If you lose them all, you still have the keys bonded to your person (brain) and are analog self-sovereign.\n* Next you run your own node. Why? Because, you can broadcast your own transactions with zero 3rd parties involved. And because you have access to the best conjoin/joinmarket options. Your node can be easily ran remotely even if you're not in the country with iOS/Android apps like ZeusLN, which is super user friendly and fun to use. Many put their nodes in countries they don't live in to begin with for various reasons ranging from taxes to privacy. You can use your hard wallet with your node.\n* Next, you don't buy BTC from CEXs (centralized exchanges)--ever. These are the only vectors governments can lever blockchain forensics effectively. You use established bitcoin DEXs (decentralized exchanges) like [Bisq.network](https://Bisq.network), or [Hodlhodl.com](https://Hodlhodl.com) whenever you want to buy or sell BTC.\n* Next (and this is optional) learn how to use powerful tools like BTCPayserver.\n* Lastly and most obviously, always use a VPN. That goes for your computer and phone\n\nAll this shit is a beginners guide, but should be enough for 99.9% of all privacy concerns. Blockchain forensics firms btw, grossly overstate their capabilities, and to PROVE ownership of a wallet, the US and Canada would need access to your physical device or Xpub/Zpub. These cases are very difficult an expensive to prosecute, which is why you see major hacks take years to build cases. Hell, just avoid CEX's and it's probably enough for 99.9% of privacy problems.

Trezor wallets are safe and user friendly, but you still need to be careful and use them properly.  If you make a mistake, you can still lose your coins.  It's easy not to make a mistake as long as you always take your time though, never rush a transaction.  Double and then triple check everything before clicking send.\n\nAlso, if you're going to get into crypto please spend 20-30 mins researching what kind of scams are used to steal btc from people.  Unfortunately scammers are everywhere, but the good thing is they aren't too smart, so if you learn their scams and are careful they are VERY easy to spot.  Take the time to learn first before putting money in.\n\nScammers will browse the crypto subs and look for beginners like yourself.  They send a DM and will try all sorts of things to get your money.  Never trust a DM regarding crypto.  They will do things like \"help\" you learn how to buy, but they steal it. Or they promise to \"help\" you invest, but again will steal it.  This can all easily be avoided by spending the time to learn before you put money in.",

This works by bundling your transition data + your private key and hashing the whole thing with one of those special algorithms again. This is the critical part that ideally is happening on an airgapped device because it's the only time your private key is exposed. The magic is that to verify this transaction is authentic, I only need to know the transaction details + your **public** key. Because your public key is mathematically correlated to your private key it can prove unequivocally that it originated from your private key. Meanwhile you never had to expose your private key to the Internet.\n\nYour image analogy doesn't really apply, it's best not to think of it as the BTC being \"in\" your wallet. The wallet doesn't contain anything, it's just your way of interacting with the network. I prefer to think of it as certain bitcoin (UTXOs) get your address assigned as their owner.

This is an unsigned transaction. The private key is used to sign that transaction. Signed transactions are what are recorded in the blockchain, and are the ultimate proof of what a private key is worth.\n\nThink of a public key as a signature, and a private key as the hand of the person who has that signature. Then add in that in the bitcoin system, forgery of another person's signature is effectively impossible. We are essentially sending value to other people's signatures, and the only way that value will leave the recipients hands is if they, and only they, sign off on sending it out again.\n\nThe biggest difference between this analogy and the reality is that it's entirely possible to send value to a signature that no one actually has or may ever have, and that if you aren't careful with your private key \"hand\", someone can cut it off and write your signatures with it. But that's the gist of it. If you can keep a private key private, then the value attributed to that key by the blockchain will never, under any condition, leave it until you spend it intentionally.

                    "response": "> so how do people know what my balance is?\n\nWhen people talk about whales, it really means people with a large amount of money in a single address.\n\nWhen you buy and move bitcoin, you often do it with maybe $100, or $1000, maybe even $10,000.\n\nWhen a whale does it, they buy and move $millions and then when the price of bitcoin goes up, it will be $billions. Maybe some of those addresses started off with $100 but it was back in 2010.\n\nAlso, the whole practice of \"don't re-use addresses\" wasn't very popular in the past because it would mean multiple backups and complicated setups. Today, it takes just a single backup thanks to new ideas being developed over time. I wouldn't be surprised if there were people using old technology, especially the richer ones who are too busy living it up to care about changing their setups.\n\n\n> how do I know what my wallet address or balance is?\n\nYOU know your balance because your wallet tells you. If you are using a hardware wallet, then it may even be able to provide an XPUB file to you which will let you set up a mobile wallet that can see your addresses but can't spend from them (watch-only wallet). BlueWallet with a ColdCard is a good setup for example.\n\nThe addresses you own are practically random, there is no observable pattern that others can use to see your addresses. However, they are technically not random, with a single key, a program will be able to get a list of all of your addresses, and if that key is the private key or your seed words, then that program can also spend it.\n\n> If I use electrum how can I find out my wallets address?\n\nThe best way is to get an XPUB file or a \"watch-only export file\" or whatever your hardware wallet or software wallet might call it. Depending on what your wallet is, the instructions on how to get this may be different or the feature may not even exist.\n\nWith the XPUB, you can load that into Electrum and it will show you all of your addresses and your balance. \n\nIf you can't get an XPUB, then your best bet is to give it your private keys or mnemonic seed words. Unless you are a digital security expert, don't bother. Chances are you might get lucky and not lose all of your bitcoin, but there is a less than 0% chance that you get unlucky and make some security mistake and a few days later you find all your bitcoin was stolen.",

During period of high deflation(appreciation) tx velocity tends to increase and merchant processors actually see an increase in spending for goods and services and charitable giving in Bitcoin.\n\nThis is believed to be caused by the feeling of newfound wealth(because they are wealthier) eventually overrides their desire to \"hoard\" (when did savings become a negative thing?) their Bitcoin.\n\nOf course more data needs to confirm this and as we enter another bull cycle(rapid deflation) it looks like we will get another round of data to confirm this.\n\nBitcoin is already testing some economic theories and proving them somewhat inaccurate but the data gathering is far from over and we all have a lot to learn .\nI personally suspect that what matters for a viable currency besides these other properties discussed here\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/gnzeeo/will_bitcoin_ever_be_adopted_by_the_general_public/frcry8f/\n\nIs stability and thus either low and predictable inflation or low and predictable deflation (1-4%) can both be suitable. As Bitcoins market cap grows and monetary inflation drops it appears that we will likely see very low deflation (occasionally people losing some coins) which is perfectly fine because the market will factor those expectations into consideration for loans and debt.\n________________________________________\nI personally prefer slight deflation for these reasons :\n\n1)\tEncourages people to invest in things they really need instead of unnecessary fluff and short term desires which is good for society and the environment\n\n2)\tencourages more savings instead of debt slavery which removes choice, confidence and power away from individuals\n\n\n3)\tkeeps fiat currency in check where too much inflation will cause more capital flight to Bitcoin and prevents corrupt governments from abusing the backdoor tax of inflation\n\n4) Reduces the negative cantillon effect of fiat by removing some of the control over currency from a small group of people that is in part due to fiat being inflationary\nhttps://fee.org/articles/the-cantillon-effect-because-of-inflation-we-re-financing-the-financiers/",

Send entire amount every time you do this to insure that the exchange cannot associate your Unique withdrawal addresses with each transaction.\n\nNote- you can technically use a single wallet and use \"coin control \" feature to manually separate out your UTXOs but the above is an idiot proof method to avoid mistakes\n\nWhy?\n\nYou can easily spend Bitcoin privately in many ways , including just using a lightning wallet today . Since you are just concerned about long term privacy you are better off simply creating evidence immediately for plausible deniability that the address you withdrew to (assumed by exchanges and regulators to likely be yours) no longer has the bitcoin and those bitcoin could have been spent , lost, sold , used within a small window of time where no or an insignificant amount of capital gains would have occurred.\n\n---------------\n\n**Immediate Privacy**\n\nIf you need privacy immediately than you can either spend your bitcoin right away with a lightning wallet and if you want a very cheap way to mix to send a tx onchain your coins than you can use 2 lightning wallets to help mix your coins like this :\n\nExchange > Lightning wallet A (breez) > lightning wallet B (phoenix) > back on chain to merchant or another one of your onchain wallets\n\nof use payjoin. payjoin is a new way to become very private onchain and reduce the UTXO set while doing so , its already in btcpay and bluewallet\n\nhttps://blockstream.com/2020/04/16/en-bitcoin-privacy-improves-with-btcpay-servers-p2ep-implementation/\n\n\nOr use liquid that has confidential transactions \n\nor coinjoin with joinmarket\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbMyPRiUxFg",

It's not a middleman like Bitpay, so you can argue that middlemen are indeed unnecessary ;)",

Giving your seed phrase and password to *anyone* risks anything from their metal stamped seed words being compromised by your lawyer and your crypto stolen, to your family using social engineering or a bounty to steal your password from your lawyer, to them just deciding to team up with your lawyer to take your crypto.    \n\nDo you know what your lawyer's IT security protocols are? Is your lawyer resistant to data breaches? Who has access to your lawyer's offices?   \n\nIf you're going to use the metal plates method, go to a bank with lock boxes in an actual vault (not just locked drawers in a room), and leave the seedphrase there. The passphrase is now less critical. You have to assume that both your family and your lawyer have poor security habits, as most people don't know anything about security.\n\n\n*edit: tagging /u/MountainousFog for visibility*",

They are all scams. \n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a miracle. \n\nhttps://armantheparman.com/why-bitcoin-only/\n\nI want to start by stressing that it all comes down to scarcity. Without scarcity, cryptocurrency may as well be fiat. Good money is scarce. The biggest weakness of cryptocurrencies is that they can be created easily from nothing. All alts are like this. But Bitcoin is different. It has miraculously been born and has gained a huge lead in network effects. This can not be copied. Thus, it has gained scarcity. It is extremely decentralised, and has by far the greatest hashing power on the planet, and distribution of full nodes, which makes it not possible to tamper with the monetary policy. Bitcoin has scarcity due to network effect lead and \u201cun-tamper-ability\u201d.\n\nThe Lindy effect will only make it stronger as day after day it doesn\u2019t die. It can\u2019t be eradicated, just like a cancer that has spread too far.\n\nThe copies cannot compete with this. It needs the majority to not only leave Bitcoin, but mostly leave to the same choice. There are thousands of choices, so those few people that abandon Bitcoin will not all go to the same choice. In other words, defectors will disperse, not concentrate. The only way this could theoretically happen is if there is some fatal flaw with Bitcoin, AND it can\u2019t be fixed, AND an altcoin can, AND only one altcoin can.\n\nE.g. let\u2019s say Bitcoin\u2019s privacy weakness (really it\u2019s a trade off, not a weakness and any other coin with privacy just chooses a different trade off) is suddenly critical and everyone is exiting. Where will they go? Monero, Zcash, DASH, some to ETH and XRP (not private btw), Cardano\u2026. Can they all be money? Money printer go brrrr much?\n\nSo how else can an Altcoin take over? Remember that people will save in the best money. An Altcoin must become fundamentally better. In the open source world, how is that possible? It\u2019s like thinking it\u2019s possible for a better operating system to exist than the dominant open source one today (GNU Linux). The open source leader just gets better and better. All new ideas get absorbed.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine another currency finds a good use case. Let\u2019s say smart contracts. First that\u2019s like saying paper is money and valuable because contracts can be written on it. No, you need to make good money first, not find other uses for it. Aluminium has more uses than gold but it\u2019s less valuable because it is not money. It can\u2019t be money because it is not scarce. But even if smart contracts makes a cryptocurrency into good money, there are too many: ETH, Cardano, TRON, Iota, probably others.\n\nAs soon as any becomes valuable, it will invite competition and it will be copied. There is no scarcity. For goodness sake, ETH doesn\u2019t even work yet. Its Turing completeness is not even used. Bitcoin has smart contract capability and I understand nearly everything ETH is doing program-wise can be done with Bitcoin. Let\u2019s face it, it is competing with Bitcoin as a money and is far far behind and has no credibility. What will Vitalik Buterin do with the monetary policy next?\n\nETH is just another fiat with a central banker. That is not a true cryptocurrency. Remember why Bitcoin was born \u2013 we are fighting central banking and trying to separate money and state, not shoot ourselves in the foot by losing focus, trying to get rich by improving on the solution we already miraculously discovered. Bitcoin is that: a miracle \u2013 and we should embrace it.\n\nAlso, you mention ROI. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist so you can buy it and sell it for more fiat later. It is a REPLACEMENT for fiat. You buy and NEVER sell. You spend once it achieves its true value. You don\u2019t need an exit strategy. You just save in Bitcoin. With alts, you need to time your exit and sell to a greater fool, because alts are scams, holding forever will get you rekt. Just DCA Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s like picking up gold off the ground before anyone else realises it will become money. Don\u2019t pick up pebbles or seashells (alts), your pockets have limited space. Finally, the most important problem to solve is separating money and state. All other problems are tiny in comparison. We don\u2019t need to replace the legal system with smart contracts. We don\u2019t need a token for everything. We don\u2019t need to put bananas on a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is an invention that solves a humanitarian problem. Altcoins take a solution (blockchain) and try to find a problem. Remember that.",

They also charge a $20 withdraw fee, but if I take the risk of leaving my BTC on the exchange until I've bought a few $k worth, that's low enough.\n\nI just got Gemini set up, but they charge 1.5% on buy via ACH. I had to wire an initial deposit to verify my bank account. There was no fee from Gemini when buying BTC with that (though my bank charged me $10 for the wire). Gemini gave me a significantly worse price than [Binance.us](https://Binance.us), but no fee on withdraw.\n\nI have both Kraken and eToro accounts, but they both use Trustly, so I have no way to get money in. My bank isn't supported by Trustly, and I wouldn't use it if it were. The \"secure connection\" runs javascript in an iframe from [paywithmybank.com](https://paywithmybank.com). While I doubt it's an outright scam, I imagine it must limit my rights with my bank. Another bank I have that Trustly does support has this in the agreement:\n\n>In the event of unauthorized use of your username and password, or any  other security or authentication technique we use, you may be liable for  resulting losses, to the extent permitted by law or regulation.\n\nSeems to me that if I gave my password to Trustly and anything goes wrong, it's not my bank's problem. Furthermore, that bank explicitly has a section to authorize 3rd-party data sharing, but Trustly has nothing to do with that as far as I can tell. I'm likely just paranoid, but the whole Trustly model seems wrong to me.\n\nI also had a Coinbase account, but I could never get verified, and their customer support was the worst, so I closed the account. (I've since learned that all the exchanges customer support is similarly non-existent.)\n\nYes, I plan to give Bisq a try since my bank does support Zelle. But I'd like an normal Exchange option too. Anyone have one they like? (Note: I'm in the US)",

I'm going to save your life here. \n\nJust buy BTC. \n\nhttps://armantheparman.com/why-bitcoin-only/\n\nI want to start by stressing that it all comes down to scarcity. Without scarcity, cryptocurrency may as well be fiat. Good money is scarce. The biggest weakness of cryptocurrencies is that they can be created easily from nothing. All alts are like this. But Bitcoin is different. It has miraculously been born and has gained a huge lead in network effects. This can not be copied. Thus, it has gained scarcity. It is extremely decentralised, and has by far the greatest hashing power on the planet, and distribution of full nodes, which makes it not possible to tamper with the monetary policy. Bitcoin has scarcity due to network effect lead and \u201cun-tamper-ability\u201d.\n\nThe Lindy effect will only make it stronger as day after day it doesn\u2019t die. It can\u2019t be eradicated, just like a cancer that has spread too far.\n\nThe copies cannot compete with this. It needs the majority to not only leave Bitcoin, but mostly leave to the same choice. There are thousands of choices, so those few people that abandon Bitcoin will not all go to the same choice. In other words, defectors will disperse, not concentrate. The only way this could theoretically happen is if there is some fatal flaw with Bitcoin, AND it can\u2019t be fixed, AND an altcoin can, AND only one altcoin can.\n\nE.g. let\u2019s say Bitcoin\u2019s privacy weakness (really it\u2019s a trade off, not a weakness and any other coin with privacy just chooses a different trade off) is suddenly critical and everyone is exiting. Where will they go? Monero, Zcash, DASH, some to ETH and XRP (not private btw), Cardano\u2026. Can they all be money? Money printer go brrrr much?\n\nSo how else can an Altcoin take over? Remember that people will save in the best money. An Altcoin must become fundamentally better. In the open source world, how is that possible? It\u2019s like thinking it\u2019s possible for a better operating system to exist than the dominant open source one today (GNU Linux). The open source leader just gets better and better. All new ideas get absorbed.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine another currency finds a good use case. Let\u2019s say smart contracts. First that\u2019s like saying paper is money and valuable because contracts can be written on it. No, you need to make good money first, not find other uses for it. Aluminium has more uses than gold but it\u2019s less valuable because it is not money. It can\u2019t be money because it is not scarce. But even if smart contracts makes a cryptocurrency into good money, there are too many: ETH, Cardano, TRON, Iota, probably others.\n\nAs soon as any becomes valuable, it will invite competition and it will be copied. There is no scarcity. For goodness sake, ETH doesn\u2019t even work yet. Its Turing completeness is not even used. Bitcoin has smart contract capability and I understand nearly everything ETH is doing program-wise can be done with Bitcoin. Let\u2019s face it, it is competing with Bitcoin as a money and is far far behind and has no credibility. What will Vitalik Buterin do with the monetary policy next?\n\nETH is just another fiat with a central banker. That is not a true cryptocurrency. Remember why Bitcoin was born \u2013 we are fighting central banking and trying to separate money and state, not shoot ourselves in the foot by losing focus, trying to get rich by improving on the solution we already miraculously discovered. Bitcoin is that: a miracle \u2013 and we should embrace it.\n\nAlso, you mention ROI. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist so you can buy it and sell it for more fiat later. It is a REPLACEMENT for fiat. You buy and NEVER sell. You spend once it achieves its true value. You don\u2019t need an exit strategy. You just save in Bitcoin. With alts, you need to time your exit and sell to a greater fool, because alts are scams, holding forever will get you rekt. Just DCA Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s like picking up gold off the ground before anyone else realises it will become money. Don\u2019t pick up pebbles or seashells (alts), your pockets have limited space. Finally, the most important problem to solve is separating money and state. All other problems are tiny in comparison. We don\u2019t need to replace the legal system with smart contracts. We don\u2019t need a token for everything. We don\u2019t need to put bananas on a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is an invention that solves a humanitarian problem. Altcoins take a solution (blockchain) and try to find a problem. Remember that.",

You have the key (seed words) to unlock it and (move the coins) create another unspent transaction, linked to a different address of which you might or might not hold the keys to.\n\n>are there any physical servers \n\nTens of thousands physical computers around the world, called nodes, storing and checking the aforementioned ledger. You can run a node too, all you need is a computer and currently about 500GB space to store the ledger (Bitcoin blockchain). Here's a [guide](https://thecryptogarage.com/umbrel-linux-ubuntu-node-build/) how to run a node that's also operating on r/thelightningnetwork (second layer of Bitcoin).\n\n> what happens once all 21 million are minded\n\nThe production of new coins will stop. This will happen sometimes around years 2140. Miners will keep running the machines because the last few decades they get paid more in fees than it's the reward for finding new blocks.",

                    "response": "Bitcoin wallets can be sorted into two categories. Custodial wallets and non-custodial wallets. Custodial wallets are like unsecured bank accounts. Kind of like banks in the old west. When you put your money in a custodial wallet, the company that runs that wallet has your actual money, but you have access to it. If a \u201cbank robber\u201d (aka hacker) robs the old West Bank (custodian) you\u2019re out of luck.\n\nNow usually banks have better security than you normally do, so it might be ok, but there\u2019s nobody to complain to if the custodian gets hacked. Your money is gone. Most exchanges' wallet (coinbase, kraken, etc.) is this kind of wallet.\n\nA non-custodial wallet puts you in full control. You\u2019re responsible for security, and if you lose the wallet no biggie, as long as you have your secure \u201ckeys\u201d saved somewhere. Keys to a bitcoin wallet are represented by a series of random words that you can write down or memorize.\n\nAs long as you never digitize these words (no pics, no email, etc) just in your head or on paper, you cannot lose your money, and nobody can take it from you by hacking. There is a saying in bitcoin circles: \u201cNot your keys? Not your coin.\u201d\n\nFor small amounts of bitcoin, a custodial wallet is no problem. I keep a little bitcoin in a custodial wallet like cash app or coinbase because it\u2019s convenient. For larger amounts of bitcoin, I would highly recommend using a non-custodial wallet.\n\nHere\u2019s a good rule of thumb. Only keep an amount of bitcoin in a custodial wallet that you would feel comfortable with in your real wallet. So if you carry around $100 in your wallet, no biggie. If you lose your wallet, it\u2019s gonna suck, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. Now if you had $5k , you probably wouldn\u2019t carry that in your wallet.\n\nSo if you ever get to the point that the bitcoin you have is worth more than you would carry in your wallet, you should move it to a non-custodial wallet where you control the keys. https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html\n\nIf this is a \"medium\" amount of money like a month or two of salary, a non-custodial wallet on your phone is fine.\n\nIf it starts climbing into a 6-12 month salary or more, I'd recommend a hardware wallet. I really like the Trezor.\n\nOnce you get a non-custodial wallet, be sure to protect those seed words they give you for backup. That is your bitcoin, not the hardware device or your phone. If you have those seed words safely stored somewhere, you can recover from any hardware loss.\n\nIf you want to go really secure, stamp those words in metal. I like these cause they aren't expensive: https://crypto-keys.com/pages/jameson-lopp-test\n\nBe sure to never digitize those words. Don't take a pic, dont put them on a computer, etc.. Write them on paper (The trezor comes with cards for this) at a minimum, and put them somewhere secure. If you do use paper, make sure they are in waterproof and fireproof envelopes. If you do decide to go with a hardware wallet, buy it directly from the manufacturer. If its tamper evident seals are broken, don't use it.",

Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. \n\nBitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. \n\n\nThere are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties\n\nYou are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft \n\nYou are exposed to exit theft \n\nYou are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit\n\nYou place Bitcoin as a whole under more systemic risk by tempting exchanges to use fractional reserve banking and giving them too much influence\n\nYou potentially reduce the probability that your investment will appreciate in value because no exchanges are doing provable audits and they might be fractional. The more Bitcoin you personally control the more likely it will appreciate in value.\n\n**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet, custodian , or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**",

                    "response": "!LNTIP 500\n\nKeep asking questions and learning!  \n\nBitcoin wallets can be sorted into two categories. Custodial wallets and non-custodial wallets. Custodial wallets are like unsecured bank accounts. Kind of like banks in the old west. When you put your money in a custodial wallet, the company that runs that wallet has your actual money, but you have access to it. If a \u201cbank robber\u201d (aka hacker) robs the old West Bank (custodian) you\u2019re out of luck.\n\nNow usually banks have better security than you normally do, so it might be ok, but there\u2019s nobody to complain to if the custodian gets hacked. Your money is gone. Most exchanges' wallet (coinbase, kraken, etc.) is this kind of wallet.\n\nA non-custodial wallet puts you in full control. You\u2019re responsible for security, and if you lose the wallet no biggie, as long as you have your secure \u201ckeys\u201d saved somewhere. Keys to a bitcoin wallet are represented by a series of random words that you can write down or memorize.\n\nAs long as you never digitize these words (no pics, no email, etc) just in your head or on paper, you cannot lose your money, and nobody can take it from you by hacking. There is a saying in bitcoin circles: \u201cNot your keys? Not your coin.\u201d\n\nFor small amounts of bitcoin, a custodial wallet is no problem. I keep a little bitcoin in a custodial wallet like cash app or coinbase because it\u2019s convenient. For larger amounts of bitcoin, I would highly recommend using a non-custodial wallet.\n\nHere\u2019s a good rule of thumb. Only keep an amount of bitcoin in a custodial wallet that you would feel comfortable with in your real wallet. So if you carry around $100 in your wallet, no biggie. If you lose your wallet, it\u2019s gonna suck, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. Now if you had $5k , you probably wouldn\u2019t carry that in your wallet.\n\nSo if you ever get to the point that the bitcoin you have is worth more than you would carry in your wallet, you should move it to a non-custodial wallet where you control the keys. https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html\n\nIf this is a \"medium\" amount of money like a month or two of salary, a non-custodial wallet on your phone is fine.\n\nIf it starts climbing into a 6-12 month salary or more, I'd recommend a hardware wallet. I really like the Trezor.\n\nOnce you get a non-custodial wallet, be sure to protect those seed words they give you for backup. That is your bitcoin, not the hardware device or your phone. If you have those seed words safely stored somewhere, you can recover from any hardware loss.\n\nIf you want to go really secure, stamp those words in metal. I like these cause they aren't expensive: https://crypto-keys.com/pages/jameson-lopp-test\n\nBe sure to never digitize those words. Don't take a pic, dont put them on a computer, etc.. Write them on paper (The trezor comes with cards for this) at a minimum, and put them somewhere secure. If you do use paper, make sure they are in waterproof and fireproof envelopes. If you do decide to go with a hardware wallet, buy it directly from the manufacturer. If its tamper evident seals are broken, don't use it.",

The best place to hold your bitcoin is in a self custody wallet preferably using cold storage. The truth is that you do not know if you really have any bitcoin until to get it into self custody. Anything you have on Coinbase is just a promise of bitcoin. You can start by downloading a software wallet to get familiar with self custody. I would recomend Electrum (electrum.org).",

Not like I'm really going to be trading BTC while I'm out and about - wouldn't it be awkward and a security risk to be carry around my keys anyway? Actually, thinking about it, if I'm hodling then I only need my public key right? Or do I actually need my private key / seed to even open the wallet for viewing? Sorry, warned you I was a newb \ud83e\udd23\n\nLightning and Liquid are both layer-2 protocols right, but look like they're used for different purposes. Do I even care whether the wallet I choose supports these or not at this stage if I only plan to hodl?\n\nBottom line is I can always change wallets easily enough at any stage right?\n\nFinally, if I go with Green:\n\na) can I have access to the same wallet on my iPhone and on my PC\n\nb) should I avoid Blockstream's optional multisig - sounds like some people have had problems with it (and Blockstream)?\n\nFinally, thanks for this great resource.

The seed phrase is what generates your private keys, addresses etc, so this is all you need to spend funds. If someone gets this for any wallet, your funds are gone. Recovery phrase is your wallet essentially.\n\n2. Green supports Liquid, so you can hold things like the Blockstream Mining Note and the upcoming El Salvador bond with it. If you\u2019re not interested in these, no need to use Liquid.\n\n3. You can switch between Electrum/Green by restoring your recovery phrase (not true for Multisig Shield option)\n\n4. As mentioned above, you can restore your recovery phrase from Green to any device you want. Same wallet on phone and PC\n\n5. Since someone only needs your recovery phrase to spend funds, Green provides additional protection through Multisig Shield, which forces the user to also provide a 2FA code. This increases protection, but you also must rely on Blockstream servers being available, and if you lose your 2FA you need to wait a year for them to reset it before spending. Benefits and trade offs to using it.\n\nCan\u2019t go wrong with either. If your plan is to use a hardware wallet, I would recommend testing Green with your few hundred dollars, either Singlesig or Multisig shield. This way you\u2019ll be familiar if you want to use a hardware wallet like Blockstream Jade in the future and can connect to your iOS device via Bluetooth. If you\u2019d like a mobile wallet to view balances, Green can provide that extra protection with 2FA that mitigates some risks of not using a hardware wallet.",

With my situation I could cash out and finally become a whole coiner which is the goal. I would basically be paying 43% tax rate on my 70k 401k. Those numbers aren\u2019t exact just for my privacy but it would get me to that whole coin. The alternate option is to continue grinding on my side hustles that allow me to put 300-500$ per week into BTC. I know that is a lot to some and a little to others, but at this rate it will take 1-2 years to get the whole coin that way depending on where the price goes. The concern is that btc will finally climb up to a higher price and sort of rest there. 35k \u2018seems\u2019 to be the floor now, what will that floor be in 1 year? 2 years? That 25k id lose to taxes could be made up pretty easily given that btc should be taking off at some point with so much institutional interest compared to years ago. I was wondering if any of you have done this or have considered it. My conviction is high but I also need to be smart. It just seems that with every day that passes fewer and fewer people will be able to become whole coiners. I also know that having a whole coin is an arbitrary goal but it seems like the most appropriate threshold to cross for me. The goal after that is 2.1 etc. and it never really ends\u2026but I really don\u2019t want to miss this asymmetric chance. Thanks for any and all of your thoughts!",

If you think about how often sometimes cards are used on vacations (multiple gas station stops a day, food stops, grocery runs, souvenir shops, etc.) many of them can all be done in a fraction of a second with contactless.\n\nI get 3% cash back on all travel transactions, and if there are issues with charges, I can dispute them. This isn't to try to insult Bitcoin or anything, but people who try to portray card transactions in a negative light are really not being fair and considering how many millions if not billions of swipes/taps/chip reads there are a day.\n\nBitcoin is freedom, and yes, it allows you to circumvent banking rules, but if the status quo for regular payments is just as if not more convenient, then I'd argue Bitcoin is NOT as convenient yet.",

I can send payments to employees in foreign countries easily\n\n11) **Interesting and fun** It is fascinating mixture of technology, game theory, security, mathematics, politics, and economics that never bores me",

I still have it, but cannot access it currently as it's buried somewhere at my parent's.       \nI recently finally found the notebook I wrote the information down in. I have what looks like a username I chose, a sixteen character combination of letters, numbers, and symbols, a six character number, and a nine word string written down. It's possible that not all of this is Bitcoin or wallet related since I used the notebook for other things, too; it may be for something else I can't remember.\n\nIs there a way for me to easily access this wallet and it's contents using this information I have written down without having access to that computer or the data on that hard drive? Preferably on Android if possible. I have Bitcoin . org's Android wallet installed, and I could be overlooking it, but I'm not seeing anywhere to put this information in. I have a laptop, but it's very old and sluggish and only a small part of the screen is usable ever since my cat sat on it, lol. So using the computer would be a pain in the ass, but is doable if I really need to. \n\nThank you!",

Looks like what I am struggling to understand is the follows:  \n\n\nThere are two types of transactions in bitcoin. The first one is the the transaction of bitcoin that is already mined. That is the transfer of hands of bitcoin that is already in circulation. And, I believe this type of transaction is instant?  \n\n\nThe second type of transaction is the process through with a new bitcoin is mined. And, mining a new bitcoin - which is the same thing as verifying the \"transactions\"- is what I guess takes close to 10 minutes.  \n\n\nSo, how exactly do these two things relate, if they relate at all?",

When you send bitcoin in a lightning wallet validation and **confirmations** are instant.\n\n>mining a new bitcoin - which is the same thing as verifying the \"transactions\"\n\nIncorrect, looks like you are conflating confirmations with validation/verifying. Full nodes validate transactions and blocks according to the consensus rules(and most full nodes are not run by miners) and the miners order transactions in blocks. When you send a bitcoin transaction it instantly gets \"validated\" by all full nodes(again , most not controlled by miners) without waiting for a confirmation (when a miner includes your transaction in a block this is called a confirmation). This is for onchain transactions , for lightning your set of txs are pre-confirmed.",

Then it's up to Visa to say whether or not I get your money. That's a pull system. \n\nWith Bitcoin, only you can push a payment. Only the person with the private keys can send Bitcoin to a proper Bitcoin address. That address can belong to you, someone else, a Bitcoin exchange, etc. Nobody can pull money from your Bitcoin stack. \n\nPlus Bitcoin is BTC as it's currency. The supply of BTC is algorithmically determined. We know the exact supply of BTC at all times. And we know almost exactly what it will be at all points into the future. \n\nEvery 10 minutes, a Bitcoin miner finds a block. They get a block reward plus the transaction fees from their block. The block reward is newly created BTC. Every 4 years the block reward is cut in half. This means every 4 years Bitcoin cuts its inflation rate in half, and that causes the price of Bitcoin to soar due to the supply shock. You want to hold Bitcoin through as many of these halving events as you can for your children's sake. I'm talking generational wealth.",

This would account for each owning 1.6% of the total supply and they plan on selling this with their ETF so these bitcoin wont be owned by them in the future either\n\ninstitutions are not single investors but many investors so this is even less of a problem \n\nhttps://bitcointreasuries.net/\n\nAs you can see that they all own a small fraction of 1% and the largest owner MicroStrategy is a little over half a percent \n\n>But don't do central banks just get replaced by big holder?\n\nproof or work insures that those with the most stake don't get to automatically censor transactions . Your concerns have more to deal with proof of stake. \n\nProof of stake as a whole is pointless, insecure, and will always trend to centralization\n\nProof of stake game theory insures that those with the most coins will continue to collect the most fees , thus creating a vicious cycle of centralization where they continue to accrue more coins with 0 effort unlike with Proof of work where a meritocracy exists of those trying to be more efficient and miners are forced to sell most of their coins\n\nHere is a breakdown of the power dynamics in bitcoin when it comes to the rules of the protocol.\n\nUltimately economic users hold the most value and determine the immediate outcome in a Hard fork split. \n\n**Miners** have invested a lot in infrastructure , but have tight margins and typically have electrical and rental contracts where they cannot afford to mine coins that are unprofitable for long due to the community rejecting it. \n\n**exchanges** Have a lot of influence upon the naming of tokens or at least their ticker and act as somewhat of a large investor. This is another reason among many that we advise you to store your BTC yourself because we want users to be in control and not large centralized exchanges. They can also help predict an outcome of a split with future trading pairs. \n\n\n**Merchants and payment processors** give legitimacy to a chain , increase its network effect and influence more users to use that chain in the long term\n\n**Developers, specialists and Oracles**  They cannot force code upon the users and since nodes don't self update economic users can reject their proposals with as little as inaction. These people indirectly influence economic users indirectly because the whole ecosystem depends upon them for security fixes and updates. Many developers are extremely large stakeholders due to being involved in Bitcoin since 2010 and 2011. \n\n**economic Users** have the most control. Ones that validate the rules with a full node cannot be coerced into new rules even with 100% of hashpower deciding upon something. Since miners have such high overhead they will typically quickly follow the lead of these users because they buy their product and it is quite costly to ignore their wishes. \n\nNot all economic users are equal however and there are different types of economic users. \n\n1) **Spenders** tend to use bitcoin for its utility and buy it just to spend instead of long term investment. These cannot influence HF split outcomes much because they typically do not have many BTC at any given time thus aren't awarded many BTC split tokens to wield their influence with\n\n2) **Hodlers / Investors** These individuals have a great power since they are given both sides of the coin in HF they can quickly determine the outcome in a speculation war . These people tend to be conservative IMHO with scaling as they have greatly profited from the years of stability and have a lot to risk by any proposal that damages bitcoins key characteristics or security. With every passing year the amount of large whales will drop and BTC will become more evenly distributed.\n\nIn reality we want bitcoiners to be both spenders and investors and there is a spectrum in the two above with how much one fits in each category",

The intelligentsia of the market is the combined knowledge of all humans and algorithms which is more than knowledge than anyone can have. Also bitcoin is so scarce that a single wealthy investor can significantly move the market in secret and unannounced.\nRather than trying to time the market , let time work for you.\n\n**Time in the market will tend to beat timing the market**\n\nEvery persons investment strategy is highly dependent upon their personal lives so what works for one person doesn't work for others. \n\nHere are some examples :\n\n1) If you were to ask what my investment strategy than here you go-  https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/s93wzd/what_currently_are_the_most_universally_accepted/htlbesp/\n\n2) another strategy to focus on maximum gains is to lump sum invest because - https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/seyzwq/dca_or_buy_during_a_dip/humjx7m/\n\n3) Another strategy if you don't want to lump sum and want to reduce volatility is - Thus if you get paid twice a month than what you should do is buy some Bitcoin immediately twice a month and also in addition set buy limit orders on an exchange for 5-10% below spot price. If those orders do not get filled by  the following paycheck than buy your set amount and reset the buy limit orders for 5-10% below spot price from the current market price.\nThe reason for this is 2 fold:\n\na)\tyou can auto pickup savings with BTC volatility on the dips which is psychologically rewarding\n\nb)\tIf a large amount of people create large amounts of Buy limit support than BTC becomes more stable unit of account and more liquid leading to more investor confidence and making BTC more of a currency(less volatility = better unit of account) and thus increases the likelihood your investment will continue appreciating in value.\n\n\nThe reason having a fiat savings account is so important is it not only will it save you if you lose a job or have an unexpected car expense or medical bill, but that it makes you a more rational investor that is less stressed out by the volatility in your more risky investments like Bitcoin. Bitcoin historically has had at least 2 bear markets lasting a little over 1 year thus you need to be prepared to not be forced to sell at a loss for at least 2 years to give yourself enough of a buffer.",

I need to send $110 to someone, but I'm not sure how much bitcoin to buy so that after the fees, I have as close to $110 (without going under $110) as possible.\n\nWhen I donated $20 to someone through bitcoin a couple of months ago, I had to buy $22 or $23 worth of bitcoin so by the time the fees were taken off, they still got $19-$20. I don't understand how people make precise payments with btc. I would assume I'd probably have to spend like $122 to send $110 USD worth of bitcoin, but I might be low on that estimate.\n\nThanks!

If you shut down for 3 days, it will take about an hour to catch up. If you shut down your node for a week or more, don't be in a hurry to use your wallet to make new transactions",

It only needs to be connected to the internet when the node maintainer needs it to (to broadcast their transactions or to verify incoming transactions). It can be offline the whole time besides that. But the longer it's offline, the longer it will need to catch up with synching the missed blocks (that have been mined meanwhile).  \n\n> It needs to have enough disk space to store the blockchain  \n\nA full node can be run in pruned mode, requiring only ~5-10GB of space. There's usually no need to store the entire blockchain at once (at least it's not a requirement to be considered a \"full node\").",

Proof of work is important because \n\n1) They do not legally fit the Howey test as a security. This is not merely an opinion but tested case law in the USA. \n\n2) A similar amount of effort in securing the coin must be invested to be rewarded the coin creating long term incentives in the project and making it very costly to attack it. Miners who have sunk infrastructure costs on mining a particular algo, especially with ASICs\n\n3)  Fair Coin Distribution.  No scammy ICO , premine or instamine is created and miners are forced to sell most of their coins to cover the expense (mainly ASICs + electricity) which allows a fair distribution and competition in the minting process.\n\n4) Since mining BTC is so competitive, profit margins are typically thin and thus new entrants that either use a better tool to mine (ASIC) or find cheaper sources of power(typically green due to the economics) can quickly gain market share making lasting monopolies difficult. Even if a main ASIC manufacturer appears to have a large market share we can see this quickly change due to a single malinvestment or a mistake when developing the newest ASIC. Power is a resource that comes from many sources and allows many locations around the world to remain competitive for unique reasons. \n\n5)\tObjective Security- Proof of work gives us an objective and measurable degree of security where risk assessments can be made with greater precision that isn't afforded with more subjective forms of security.\n\n6)\tThere is no company that controls a pure PoW coin in many cases thus the project will win or fail on its own merit and doesn't have a long burn rate created by speculators\n\n7)\tProof of stake game theory insures that those with the most coins will continue to collect the most fees , thus creating a vicious cycle of centralization where they continue to accrue more coins with 0 effort unlike with Proof of work where a meritocracy exists of those trying to be more efficient and miners are forced to sell most of their coins\n\n>why u r trying to push it on me?!! \n\nPlease do not buy any Bitcoin or cryptocurrency until you learn more. Bitcoin being disinflationary does not need new investors to continue to grow in value . If you think of bitcoin as a useful money (you can save 3-20% almost off everything when you spend bitcoin) or as a uncorrelated asset class to better hedge your portfolio than great , but until than do not invest and learn more. Bitcoin is still in the very early adoption phase at 2% global adoption and there is no need to feel rushed or pressured. \n\n> how I can trust Bitcoin and Crypto as a real investment\n\nYou should be extremely skeptical and learn the basics first",

Marketing and advertisements work. That's why tech giants like Google and Facebook are as big as they are. Having a good product/service and gaining customers solely through word-of-mouth might work for relatively small businesses in some sectors, but simply stating that any good product will sell itself without advertisements isn't really reflective of the modern world.\n\n> amount of crypto investment requested I receive is just unbelievable mostly in social media. my reply to them always is if it is good business why u r trying to push it on me?!! get all profits ? why u need me? \n\nPretty much all of these advertisements fall into one of two categories:\n\n1. They're for an alt-coin, ICO, token or some other not-quite-Bitcoin cryptocurrency. They're essentially saying \"you know about Bitcoin? Check out our similar thing that no one has heard of.\"\n\n2. They're for a service that offers Bitcoin-related trading. What such ads are saying is \"You want Bitcoin? Use our service to get it.\"\n\nIn both cases, the advertisement is not about Bitcoin. It more or less assumes that the viewer already knows about Bitcoin and it uses that to direct your attention to whatever product or service they're trying to sell.\n\nBitcoin itself doesn't advertise, because there's no business behind Bitcoin. There are businesses that offer products/services that use or involve Bitcoin, but their purpose is to promote their own products/services, not Bitcoin. If Bitcoin becomes more popular, it will likely benefit their business, but Bitcoin is big enough that no Bitcoin-related business can get a good return on investment in promoting Bitcoin in general as opposed to their own product/service. And many altcoins/tokens/ICOs are the product of a centralized business that seeks to benefit from propping up that specific altcoin/token/ICO. \n\nFinally, I agree that the trading/investing aspects aren't all that interesting compared to the technical side. For that, you can simply start by reading the Bitcoin whitepaper, which is the document that started it all. Most of it isn't too technical for the average reader. Beyond that, there are highly praised books on the technical / practical aspects of Bitcoin, such as Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos. But since most people who are interested in those parts of Bitcoin tend to gravitate away from books and more towards online resources, you may be right that in the realm of Bitcoin books, the trading-focused books, which target a different audience, start to outnumber the technical books.",

Gold is valuable in itself because of its properties: it is difficult to destroy, and it is rare/scarce.\n\nIt has other properties that we give it such as useful for jewellery, electronics, and useful for monetisation (store of value amidst the inflation of all of our fiats).\n\nBitcoin has some properties: it is \"eventually\" immutable (eventually because it takes a few blocks before you can consider it immutable), it is highly divisible, it is weightless (move massive units across the world in seconds), and it is indifferent to politics despite its functionality being based on human consensus.\n\nBitcoin is not easy to compare, it is something very new. That indifference makes it great for being a-political (uncensorable) to the point where it can't be used in any way to impose sanctions, it is anti-fragile in that if a subset of people choose to force Bitcoin to behave differently, bitcoin doesn't change, it splits into 2 different networks and the free market chooses which one is more valuable based on people's free will to use one over the other. This happened in 2017 for the blocksize wars and is an amazing thing to read about.\n\nSo bitcoin has properties that people can get behind and it is scarce, more so than gold. This makes it perfect for monetisation and that is what is happening. The thing about monetising bitcoin is that it can be a store of value but the technology is so frictionless that there is no reason to then start using it as a medium of exchange.\n\nIt is already being used to help people do commerce cross borders where using traditional currency requires old slow and expensive service providers, this is something that we've never had... Send money across the internet without a slow chain of middlemen that need to protect themselves from each other so they use credit agreements and batch payments etc.\n\nIf you're getting your advice from \"crypto\" experts, you're probably getting a lot of misinformation. Bitcoin wasn't the first attempt at a digital impartial money, but it is the first that is still working. It takes a while to really internalise and understand its consensus algorithm, but consensus means something we all agree on. By having some other coin with another consensus algorithm, we have non-consensus. These people should be working on finding ways to increase Bitcoin's consensus, not trying to fracture it.\n\nBitcoiners focus on consensus and decentralisation so much because it is literally the thing that Satoshi introduced new into the mix of other existing technologies to make bitcoin and he did it for a specific reason: all previous attempts were taken over or shut down.\n\nDon't trade bitcoin, use it to preserve your wealth using something scarce, hard to destroy or manipulate, and something that is actually finding its purpose and drawing in market share.",

Currencies like the US dollars and euros were taken off the gold standard many years ago which is why they are called \"fiat\" currencies. They get their value based upon supply and demand subjectively from humans believing they have value. \n\nNo fiat currency currently is backed by gold or silver\n\n> I look to Bitcoin and Crypto in general , what are they backed up with\n\nI used to be into PMs , but years ago sold all of my gold and silver when I started to wake up and learn the truth.\n\nGold is more difficult to secure, takes up more space, my stocks have been a much higher ROI, historically gold is a horrible Store of value dropping in purchasing power for many years and far longer than Bitcoin bear markets, almost no one accepts gold or silver, it is difficult to spend because not as potable or divisible. The whole \"intrinsic value\" marketing slogan is a myth.\n\nPMs and Gold are very useful elements. Bitcoin is a very useful currency. \"intrinsic value\" is a misleading term that many gold bugs like to use that seems to either suggest there is some \"inherent value\" in something physical or that gold has alternative usecases other than as money it can fall back on.\n\nGold is a useful element and Bitcoin is a useful technology. Both derive their value subjectively from humans. Just because something is physical in nature doesn't mean that it has value to humans. Many physical things have negative value like trash that people pay others to take from them. Even very useful resources can sometimes have negative value like we saw with crude oil futures temporarily.\n\nhttps://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value\n\nAs for alternative use cases , Bitcoin has many as its a timestamping protocol, currency, store of value asset, payment rail, smart contract platform, decentralized messaging system. It can fail on 1 or multiple of these and still be a tremendous success.\n\n>(which is by itself not eco friendly but ignore that)\n\nThis notion comes  from a flawed understanding of economics. Fiat currency and PoS coins cost at least the same amount of resources to  create , regulate and secure as Bitcoin.\n\nThere is an inescapable reality for any asset or currency that as it increases in value the production costs and costs to secure increase as well . This is demonstrated in the economic axiom: MC=MR\n\n\u201cRent\u201d always forces production costs (MC) to always equal sale prices (MR)\n\nPoS currencies and fiat are simply more abstract and complex forms or Proof of Work that use more human involvement (which uses tremendous amounts of resources and has a tremendous environmental impact) as a PoW coin like Bitcoin. Humans instead of ASICs are shouldering more of the work to create, regulate , and secure each of those currencies; This is \"work\" whether it involves burning electricity directly or food and electricity that humans consume  to perform their work. This is an inescapable economic reality. The more valuable something is the more it will cost to secure it because the more effort will be made to steal and or control it. This applies to any currency or asset.\n\nThis is also better understood with the dollar auction dilemma. In a hypothetical auction where a bidding war is fighting over the right to mint a 1 dollar bill how much do you think people will be willing to spend for this power ?\n\n>but how really stable is the crypto? \n\n99% of the cryptocurrency ecosystem is filled with scams or pointless pump and dumps and is not stable at all. The true innovation in this category is \"Proof of Work\" and what makes a blockchain secure and decentralized.",

And unlike gold which is a physical asset that can *generally* be found/mined again, losing Bitcoin from the crypto economy is an irreversible process. \n\nIt seems to me like the people that have the most to gain are people already invested in Bitcoin currently. And in terms of using it as an actual currency, the longer time goes on, the smaller the increments that will be transacted between regular people, as its value skyrockets. Decades down the road, the distribution of the currency will largely be determined by the how generous the current owners are. It's not too unlike how we're currently held to the whims of governments' spending decisions when it comes to distributing fiat, except it's even less democratic because private owners have no obligation to anyone but themselves. Governments at least have to keep up somewhat of an appearance of caring. \n\nI guess my question is, how is this better than the current monetary system, and how can it act as a universal currency when its supply cannot be replenished? Besides hype, what factors are actually propping the value of Bitcoin?\n\nThe only time I can see Bitcoin being useful is in times of political turmoil. If your country's fiat is not accepted, then it can serve as a backup. But I'd rather not invest in something that relies on the countries falling into disarray to prop up its value. \n\nSorry if this post seems critical, I just feel like I must be missing something big here if I'm seeing all these flaws yet so many people are into Bitcoin.

                    "response": "Bitcoin being disinflationary means that every 4 years its monetary inflation is cut in half as well, thus bitcoin does not need to new adoption to grow in value \n\nOf the almost 19 million mined Bitcoin the estimates are 2-4 million lost bitcoin . When bitcoins are lost or destroyed it does not harm Bitcoin network at all, and simply acts as a charitable donation to all Bitcoin users making Bitcoin more scarce. It should be noted that less bitcoin is lost these days and less will be lost in the future as the value goes up.\n\nThis is not the same as gold because with gold the larger the price increases the more incentive there exists to mine and find gold and with gold large amounts can be found like with asteroid mining.\n\nIn 2026 Psyche will start reporting back to NASA the expected reality that there will a sudden hyper-inflationary spike in the volume of gold being mined in the near future\nhttps://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/psyche/\nSince psyche 16 asteroid represents an example of an asteroid that is a core of an early planet thus metallic and estimated to contain around $700 quintillion dollars of precious metals (gold, platinum, etc..) or 93 billion dollars of precious metals per person.\nWhile mining will not start immediately, the markets will start pricing in the expectation of mining and nation states will start to slowly sell their gold reserves if they are wise enough flooding the market with cheap gold.\n\nNation states will need an alternative asset to hedge against.\n\n-----------------------\n\n>I guess my question is, how is this better than the current monetary system, and how can it act as a universal currency when its supply cannot be replenished? \n\nThe supply does not need to be replenished ever because Bitcoin is so divisible, (13 decimal places in a payment channel) the total amount doesn't matter because even if Bitcoin is worth 100 million a coin you can still have enough divisibility to buy a cup of coffee. \n\n**There is plenty of parts to go around** \n\nDivisibility is not the same thing as increased inflation either as 1 usd = 4 quarters = 10 dimes = 100 pennies with purchasing power and inflation only occurs when another dollar is printed to drive down the spending power of each dollar.\n\nIf your concerns are with slight economic deflation vs inflation\n\nI personally prefer slight deflation for these reasons :\n\n1)\tEncourages people to invest in things they really need instead of unnecessary fluff and short term desires which is good for society and the environment\n\n2)\tencourages more savings instead of debt slavery which removes choice, confidence and power away from individuals\n\n\n3)\tkeeps fiat currency in check where too much inflation will cause more capital flight to Bitcoin and prevents corrupt governments from abusing the backdoor tax of inflation\n\n4) Reduces the negative cantillon effect of fiat by removing some of the control over currency from a small group of people that is in part due to fiat being inflationary\nhttps://fee.org/articles/the-cantillon-effect-because-of-inflation-we-re-financing-the-financiers/\n\n>what factors are actually propping the value of Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is very valuable and useful money. \n\n1) **Save money** -  I like to save money with various services like lolli.com, ln.pizza ,foldapp.com,purse.io, or bitrefill.com (Bitcoin achieves this by credit and gift card arbitrage opportunities thus creating an efficiency)\n\n2) **Digital Gold** - Bitcoin is very desirable and scarce and since it is an uncorrelated asset class your portfolio is better hedged to be a safer way of finding alpha\n\n3) **Timestamping** - Tweetstamp, and opentimestamps are useful timestamping tools \n\n4) **Insurance** - If my bank account or credit cards get lost or stolen or account is frozen Bitcoin is a great alternative to store value\n\n5) **Censorship Resistance**- I can make donations to organizations like defense distributed or wikileaks even if their payment processors and banks are shutoff due to unethical political pressure\n\n6) **Sovereignty** - As a Business I can accept value even if I am deplatformed or banned from banking \n\n7) **Micro transactions** microtxs are simply not possible with fiat , where I  can do so with my BTC lightning wallet\n\n8) **Security** SSS and multisig with CLTV and other scripts allow for novel methods to secure ones wealth\n\n9) **Privacy** with electronic fiat I have no privacy unlike with Bitcoin transactions where I am given a choice between privacy or transparency with each wallet\n\n10)\t**Global** I can travel the world , rent hotels and buy plane tickets and withdraw local currency easily without fears of credit card fraud. I can send payments to employees in foreign countries easily\n\n11) **Interesting and fun** It is fascinating mixture of technology, game theory, security, mathematics, politics, and economics that never bores me",

                    "response": "Lets discuss some of the properties of what makes a good currency and where Bitcoin fits now compared to gold and fiat\n\n\n**1) Durability** = Gold is best here due to its history and physical nature. Bitcoin and fiat  being digital in nature means we must compare the  durability of the institution/network that issues and secures them. I would suggest that Bitcoin will slightly excel responsible nation states here and does far better than  unreliable forms of fiat when looking at the history of fiat compared the the history and properties of Bitcoin(2017 gave a lot of credibility to Bitcoin in it thwarting a powerful attack and nation states have repeatedly attacked Bitcoin to one degree or another)\n\n**2) Portability** = Gold is horrible in this category being physical, heavy and unable to be sent digitally(custodians don't count as you lose most the benefits of gold and it switched categories from a bearer asset to registered value). Bitcoin beats fiat here too as its peer to peer , global and lacks regulatory friction. \n\n**3) Fungibility** Gold and bitcoin tie here. When comparing fiat to Bitcoin it is more complicated but Bitcoin beats fiat here overall and is significantly getting better each year. Physical fiat has some advantages over Bitcoin in the sense that its easier to have strong privacy locally as long as the whole \"anonymity set\" (group of users) avoid depositing the fiat in ATMs and banks(physical cash has serial numbers that are tracked with OCR + bill readers everywhere). Bitcoin can be very private if you use the right wallet and you take precautions but if you make a mistake onchain you can also have problems. Bitcoin being used with a lightning wallet is extremely private by default and chain analysis is useless. Digital fiat isn't very fungible or private at all. Gold isn't as fungible as many people suggest either due to different grading, certifying prices, forms which all fetch different prices.\n\n**4) Scarcity** -- Bitcoin wins this hands down with a fixed and limited supply. ~2-4 million BTc have been permanently lost/destroyed and many people also a long term investors leading to more scarcity. Gold is a distant 2nd with concerns in asteroid mining - (Psyche 16 as an example) and not knowing if any other large deposit can be found but far superior to fiat. \n\n**5) Divisibility** Bitcoin is already divisible by 8 decimal places onchain and 1/1000 of a satoshi on other layers like lightning. Thus micro txs are possible with bitcoin and too impractical with gold and not as easily done with fiat due to regulatory friction  and costs. The idea is that machines and software can tip other software, machines, and services by the minute or second to allow for more granularity and thus more efficiency with lower prices.\n\n**6) Acceptability** - Fiat wins this category for the time being due to its acceptance worldwide , especially US dollars. Bitcoin being a global currency without regulatory friction can one day overtake even the most accepted fiat however. Almost no one accepts gold for payment so its last and this is unlikely to change. \n\n**7) Verifiability** - Bitcoin wins here slightly over gold and fiat. Gold can be verified but takes more effort and there are concerns with tungsten filled bars and fake gold. Bitcoin being swept from a private key(coin or paper) or accepting an open dime is better than fiat physical cash, and digital fiat has very large concerns and delays in verification (chargebacks, fraud, etc...)\n\n**8) stability as a unit of account** - While Bitcoin is better than certain forms of fiat in this category, most are more stable than bitcoin and so Bitcoin remains 3rd compared to fiat and gold. We hope that Bitcoin in time will become less volatile with a much larger market cap . This trend is already occurring ,and much economic theory supports this happening but its still an experiment as to how long it will take and what size market cap / liquidity is needed\n\nSo you can see bitcoin is already better than fiat in 6 of the 8 categories above and the 2 remaining categories just take time.",

The CEO of that site just stepped down\n\n6) many  banks have stopped transfers to them in the UK and other countries due to fraud investigations\n\n7) They are fighting multiple class action lawsuits due to their fraud and illegal securities\nSome examples -\nhttps://www.rosenlegal.com/cases-1839.html\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/455203877/Lee-et-al-vs-Binance\n\n8) They are mostly dependent into the tether ponzi scheme that will likely implode in the future. Binance, other than tether, holds the biggest USDT reserves thus making it the primary exchange effected when this Ponzi implodes and stopping most of its incoming liquidity. Tether and other stable coins will be increasingly targeted by regulators due to concerns of money laundering and capital flight.\n\n9)\tThey are mostly used to trade shitcoins but with supporting so many sketchy projects that increases ones attack surface from a technical layer because any bug or exploit can lead to loss of funds\n\n10) Binance \u201csmart chain\u201d is run exclusively on their own personal servers thus when the company goes defunct or arrests are made these may stop functioning and all tokens and wallets they control (trust) will have problems \n\n\n\n11) Binance is known to use their leverage tokens and trade against their clients and manipulate the market for their personal gain \n\n\n12) Binance operates without a proper license in multiple countries, more and more news is coming out about regulators in those countries specifically saying that Binance is operating illegally. This means it's easy for governments can make Binance Insolvent placing my funds at risk. Binance is not officially registered in any country and does not pay taxes making them a target for regulators.\n\n\n https://twitter.com/franciskim_co/status/1423658703174082567\nFurther reading on new risks and regulatory concerns -\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/p12oz0/best_way_to_dca/h8anlfq/\n\n13) They openly lie about their wallet being open source - https://trustwallet.com/developer/ when it is not open source\n\nhttps://walletscrutiny.com/android/com.wallet.crypto.trustapp/\n\nhttps://walletscrutiny.com/iphone/com.sixdays.trust/\n\nas you cannot test and build the binaries from source. The lie is built upon the ignorance of many that are unaware that almost all software you use is dependent upon some open source repositories/libraries/dependencies but unless we can peer review 100% of the source code and build the binaries from the source we cannot verify if any intentional or unintentional exploits or backdoors exist in the software.\n\nThis means that at best you have a wallet that is slightly better than using a custodian because you have access to the private keys that you could restore your coins in a separate wallet if their full nodes that support this light client is offline but there might be privacy leaks or exploits and backdoors that allow them or outsiders to steal your coins.\n\nWhat is the point in using cryptocurrency if you ultimately need to have faith in a single company or developer ? This undermines many of the security assumptions of cryptocurrencies.\n\n14) Incompetence by leaving 1 billion dollars worth of unconfirmed transactions for more than a year causing huge loses and frozen accounts\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/12/binance-freezes-doge-withdrawals-as-users-report-being-asked-to-return-coins-they-dont-have/\n\nhttps://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/7602e2790f3c444d8d6ed47d6954bcef",

All such addresses are linked to your wallet.\n\nSo you would want to set up a mechanism on your website that makes it so that whenever someone clicks the 'donate' button, they are presented with a new address specifically for that donor.\n\nAnd note that it's possible to do so without revealing your secret 12/24 word seed phrase to the website server where all this would be set up.\n\nThere is popular software such as the 'BTCPay Server' that can handle this for you if you set it up. See https://blog.btcpayserver.org/how-to-accept-bitcoin-donations/ for an intro.",

Just to add: just generating a new address on your Trezor and posting it on your website is most likely just fine, if you don't expect many transactions anyway. When you receive a transaction, you can simply replace the address. Or if you receive a few transactions on it before replacing, it's not a big deal either.",

Regarding fees for withdrawals. Does moving your coins from exchange to a wallet count as a withdrawal? Or is a withdrawal only when you sell coin and transfer to bank/Revolut? \n\n2b. If no to above, are there generally fees for moving to a wallet? What is that called (I'm new to the language, sorry!) so I can compare fees for that between exchanges?\n\n3. I don't currently pay tax and don't envisage investing enough to reach the threshold to pay capital gains tax.

The target is also stored in every block header  \n\nDifficulty is a calculated value, inversely proportional to target. The initial target *0x1d00ffff* (from genesis) is defined as difficulty 1  \n\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty\n\n    difficulty = difficulty_1_target / current_target",

In bitcoin most wallets change the address with every transaction for privacy benefits . Every one of these addresses is secured by the seed words and you don't need to worry about running out of addresses. If you reuse an old address the Bitcoin still comes to your wallet as well. If you only need 1 address because you are making a paper wallet that is fine . \n\nI would generate either a 12 or 24 word seed and use a BIP84 derivation path so your addresses start with bc1 for lower fees and a superior address type too.",

                    "response": "I copied this from another redditor:\n\n\nBitcoin wallets can be sorted into two categories. Custodial wallets and non-custodial wallets. Custodial wallets are like unsecured bank accounts. Kind of like banks in the old west. When you put your money in a custodial wallet, the company that runs that wallet has your actual money, but you have access to it. If a \u201cbank robber\u201d (aka hacker) robs the old West Bank (custodian) you\u2019re out of luck.\n\nNow usually banks have better security than you normally do, so it might be ok, but there\u2019s nobody to complain to if the custodian gets hacked. Your money is gone. Most exchanges' wallet (coinbase, kraken, etc.) is this kind of wallet.\n\nA non-custodial wallet puts you in full control. You\u2019re responsible for security, and if you lose the wallet no biggie, as long as you have your secure \u201ckeys\u201d saved somewhere. Keys to a bitcoin wallet are represented by a series of random words that you can write down or memorize.\n\nAs long as you never digitize these words (no pics, no email, etc) just in your head or on paper, you cannot lose your money, and nobody can take it from you by hacking. There is a saying in bitcoin circles: \u201cNot your keys? Not your coin.\u201d\n\nFor small amounts of bitcoin, a custodial wallet is no problem. I keep a little bitcoin in a custodial wallet like cash app or coinbase because it\u2019s convenient. For larger amounts of bitcoin, I would highly recommend using a non-custodial wallet.\n\nHere\u2019s a good rule of thumb. Only keep an amount of bitcoin in a custodial wallet that you would feel comfortable with in your real wallet. So if you carry around $100 in your wallet, no biggie. If you lose your wallet, it\u2019s gonna suck, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. Now if you had $5k , you probably wouldn\u2019t carry that in your wallet.\n\nSo if you ever get to the point that the bitcoin you have is worth more than you would carry in your wallet, you should move it to a non-custodial wallet where you control the keys. https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html\n\nIf this is a \"medium\" amount of money like a month or two of salary, a non-custodial wallet on your phone is fine.\n\nIf it starts climbing into a 6-12 month salary or more, I'd recommend a hardware wallet. I really like the Trezor.\n\nOnce you get a non-custodial wallet, be sure to protect those seed words they give you for backup. That is your bitcoin, not the hardware device or your phone. If you have those seed words safely stored somewhere, you can recover from any hardware loss.\n\nIf you want to go really secure, stamp those words in metal. I like these cause they aren't expensive: https://crypto-keys.com/pages/jameson-lopp-test\n\nBe sure to never digitize those words. Don't take a pic, dont put them on a computer, etc.. Write them on paper (The trezor comes with cards for this) at a minimum, and put them somewhere secure. If you do use paper, make sure they are in waterproof and fireproof envelopes. If you do decide to go with a hardware wallet, buy it directly from the manufacturer. If its tamper evident seals are broken, don't use it.",

While it's perhaps unlikely Binance and Changpeng Zhao will run off with your money, your account could get phished or hacked, or frozen for suspicious activity, and you would be left with no recourse. Money go poof.\n\nWould you go to a gold merchant, buy a bar of gold, and then leave it at the shop? No, right? So why do the exact same thing with Bitcoin?\n\nBesides all that, Binance is one of the worst exchanges you could use. The withdrawal fee is absolutely insane, designed to discourage, so you'll keep your money on the platform and gamble it away on altcoins.\n\nStrong advice from a 5 year bitcoin vet (me); You should:\n\n1. Find a new exchange (Strike, Cashapp, Gemini w/Active Trade, Coinbase Pro, Kraken..).\n2. Get an actual wallet. If you've less than $1k or $2k USD worth, then a free, open source, phone wallet like Blue Wallet or Blockstream Green will suite you fine. If you have more, get yourself a hardware wallet like Trezor or Coldcard.\n3. Learn about seed storage. This is how you back up your wallet and keep your bitcoin safe. Knowing good seed practices is by far the single most important part of holding bitcoin. (its not that hard either. write it on paper, keep it secret and off any digital/internet devices).",

The amount isn't the issue, it's about how long you hold it and what you used it for / the intent of holding it. If you intended to get crypto to make a profit, it's a CGT event.  \nThe rate that you'll be taxed is 30%, unless you hold it for >12 months, in which case it's 15% due to the CGT discount. (That means you hold the exact crypto for that long. You can't swap between different crypto, it refers to that specific individual holding).   \nThe only non-CGT events for crypto are for personal use - eg. you have the crypto specifically to use as a currency, and don't intend to make a financial gain. Your example doesn't follow that.\n2. Assuming AUD stays constant, you'd have $120, of which $20 is taxable on disposal, at 30% this will result in $6 tax. If AUD changes, you need to account for that.\n\nSource: https://www.ato.gov.au/general/gen/tax-treatment-of-crypto-currencies-in-australia---specifically-bitcoin/",

Like how all the procedures started ? \n+ where i saw about mining is that a seller makes a call and buyer is there to buy and inorder to secure the transaction miner makes complex mathematical operations and first one to solve is gonna get reward which is still ununderstable for me because what are we going to solve like it is a transaction can't we give it a hash through software ? Moreover how is block made ??? Can we do this process manually ?? I know my questions sound strange + lame because it's very easy to get it from google but google displays me with complexity which i don't want . \nI can't even understand what miners are doing in literal sense ??

Full nodes(most not in control of miners) enforce the rules and validate transactions and blocks. \n\n>How does he generates bitcoin ? \n\nThere is a controlled Fixed disinflationary supply in bitcoin where currently every ~10 minutes one miner or miner pool gets awarded 6.25 BTC \n\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply\n\nThe protocol awards the miner if they conform the rules and find a block \n\n>What does the cpu or gpu contribute towards mining ?\n\nCPU mining became obsolete in 2011 and GPU mining became obsolete in 2013. You need an ASIC to mine bitcoin these days \n\n> In it's early stanges how satoshi mined a block if he was the one who made the transaction ?\n\nThe genesis block was hardcoded in the protocol and unspendable. Early blocks mined by satoshi and many others didn't have many transactions if any. You can collect the \"coinbase\" (inflation) reward without including any transactions in a block \n\n>What is being referred when the term transaction is mentioned ?\n\nIn what context?\n\n>where i saw about mining is that a seller makes a call and buyer is there to buy and inorder to secure the transaction\n\nYou seem to be conflating offchain orders made on centralized exchanges and mining which is incorrect. The bitcoin protocol doesn't need any human or company to reward the miners.\n\n>Moreover how is block made ???\n\nMiners use bitcoin full node code (often indirectly via the pool ) with block templates to create a block and broadcast it to all other full nodes. The software/protocol itself allows them to do this",

This is not merely an opinion but tested case law in the USA with the trendon shavers case. \n\n2) A similar amount of effort in securing the coin must be invested to be rewarded the coin creating long term incentives in the project and making it very costly to attack it. Miners who have sunk infrastructure costs on mining a particular algo, especially with ASICs\n\n3)  Fair Coin Distribution.  No scammy ICO , premine or instamine is created and miners are forced to sell most of their coins to cover the expense (mainly ASICs + electricity) which allows a fair distribution and competition in the minting process.\n\n4) Since mining BTC is so competitive, profit margins are typically thin and thus new entrants that either use a better tool to mine (ASIC) or find cheaper sources of power(typically green due to the economics) can quickly gain market share making lasting monopolies difficult. Even if a main ASIC manufacturer appears to have a large market share we can see this quickly change due to a single malinvestment or a mistake when developing the newest ASIC. Power is a resource that comes from many sources and allows many locations around the world to remain competitive for unique reasons. \n\n5) Objective Security- Proof of work gives us an objective and measurable degree of security where risk assessments can be made with greater precision that isn't afforded with more subjective forms of security.\n\n5)\tThere is no company that controls a pure PoW coin in many cases thus the project will win or fail on its own merit and doesn't have a long burn rate created by speculators\n\n6)\tOther means of consensus always devolve into centralization and corrupted like Proof of stake where those with the most money or rewarded themselves with the most premine automatically collects the most fees or miner rewards for no additional effort and thus a vicious cycle occurs where they become more and more powerful unlike with Bitcoin.",

So there should be a way to easily restore the wallet using the equivalent of Electrum at the time (unless Electrum is still around in 2050).\n\nI'm looking into this question to see what wallet would provide the most security during a near 30 year period, and won't be touching if Bitcoin drops to $1,000, or increases to $10,000,000. Just storing.\n\nFrom the research I have done into this so far, having the 24 key word recovery phrase seems to be the number one most important aspect of this. But if you wanted the 25 passphrase for extra security, do all wallets support restoring a wallet using this feature?",

First of all you need inflation to account for population growth. Let's say the dollar was deflationary like bitcoin and its supply had barely increased since the year 1800. You would have a very small, disgustingly rich elite group who hold most of the supply through inheritance and everyone else would be dirt poor. There would be no middle class, just rich and poor. The same thing would happen if bitcoin were the global currency, only it'd happen much faster. What do you think happens in about 50-80 years when everyone who holds bitcoin today is dead? The vast majority of their coins will be lost forever. Due to the decentralized nature governments will be unable to claim their funds and return them into the economy. Those who are lucky enough to inherit will become part of the rich elite but with every generation that dies out the supply will go down tremendously until there is literally nothing left.",

I currently do not have any real use for the money and I would like to just keep it stored and hold it for as long as my patience will allow for. My \"strategy\" is to just withdraw my winnings from this website every month or so and send it directly to a wallet and just leave it there.\n\nAre there any websites that you would recommend? From what I have read the things to look for are security and fees. Although I'm not sure how relevant fees are in my situation as I am just hoping to hold for as long as I can. Should I buy a hardware wallet? Or should I wait till I reach a certain amount before buying one(I am basically starting from scratch)?

If you can justify spending around $100-$200 for a hardware wallet, then do that. There are many choices; I like [Foundation Passport](https://foundationdevices.com/) but it's toward the high end of that price range. If you can't justify a hardware wallet, then stick with a free software wallet for now. For long term storage and minimal use, I'd recommend [BlueWallet on iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluewallet-bitcoin-wallet/id1376878040) or [Samourai Wallet on Android](https://samouraiwallet.com/download).

Only when you withdraw funds, are the coins actually moved to your address.\n\nMost exchanges claim that they retain all user funds in their central wallets, but it's usually hard to verify these claims.

Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. \n\nBitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. \n\n\nThere are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties\n\nYou are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft \n\nYou are exposed to exit theft \n\nYou are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit\n\nYou place Bitcoin as a whole under more systemic risk by tempting exchanges to use fractional reserve banking and giving them too much influence\n\nYou potentially reduce the probability that your investment will appreciate in value because no exchanges are doing provable audits and they might be fractional. The more Bitcoin you personally control the more likely it will appreciate in value.\n\n**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet, custodian , or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**",

Whenever I have laptop or printer problems I am usually able to figure it out and solve it on my own. However, my printer was clearly possessed yesterday. Nothing I did worked. After an hour or so trying to exercise the demon out of it, I finally caved in a called the HP helpdesk. The guy was walking me through the steps and my dogs were going nuts in the background. I said, why don't I just give you access and you can go ahead and do what you do?? I'm sure it will be faster for both of us that way. So he did his thing fixing my printer and I handled my dogs. I heard him on speaker phone letting me know he was done. He explained what happened and we disconnected.\n\nLet me just say this first. I DO NOT LIKE EXTENSIONS ON MY BROWSERS. I do not like them. I don't use them. Never have. Never will. I am fully aware that often when you download something, suddenly an extension appears. So I am very vigilant when it comes to removing them. I cannot express enough how much I hate extensions. So it's not like, \"oh, did I download that?\". No I did not. Because I would never do that. So, I jump back on my computer and what do you think I see on my browser?? A Coinbase extension! Now, I KNOW I didn't download that thing?? So I put my mouse pointer on it and it says, \"full access\". I immediately removed it, and scrubbed my computer for anything else that was not supposed to be there. \n\nI do have some bitcoin in Coinbase. Not enough for me to quit my day job, but enough. Is it entirely possible that the printer tech guy tried to gain access?? Please tell me I am not crazy?",

Some people like to cite stronger positive correlation during these last 2 years but that is merely due to a macro trend in all Assets appreciating quickly due to the rapid increase in money supply . Looking at the complete history of Bitcoin and the 4 year disinflationary cycle that stocks lack makes it clear that Bitcoin is uncoorelated\n\n2) Index funds are filled with stocks that both represent \"registered value\" which is much different in its properties than bitcoin which is a Bearer Asset\n\n3) Bitcoin is investing in a protocol , Index funds are a collection of companies stocks \n\nThus both index funds and Bitcoin will be separate and wise investments in the future",

This is just for reserving amounts of money for different purposes. I\u2019ll need a convenient way to view and manage them all.\n\n2. I want to have actions available like \u201cfreeze this account for one week\u201d - do not allow me to take money out at all - or to freeze accounts permanently unless I command a transfer which occurs by default on a time delay - like, you can pull out money from this account but it always arrives one week later.\n\nThe point is for really absolute self-control in terms of spending.\n\nI am trying to pull this off with some kind of password restriction mechanism. Assuming your gateway to your crypto is the wallet password, perhaps I could write some command line scripts which perform some action by automatically entering the password, but the data is encrypted/scrambled in the file and on some deep system command to not be unencrypted except on a certain time?\n\nOr anything like that. I feel like I can think of many possible strategies but I don\u2019t know what might be most effective yet elegant and simple. The point, again, is to design a system that has a genuine time delay in it - it cannot be overridden, either at all or just not easily, at least.\n\nThanks very much",

Make sure you understand the difference between a market order and a limit order. It will dictate how much you pay based on when the order is executed. \n\n5) Once you have the BTC, transfer it to your own wallet. Make sure you write down your seed phrase and save it.

You should first do your own research and educate yourself about what bitcoin is, what blockchain is, what altcoins are and what they are used for.

Not sure from which country you are, but if you are in UK make sure you get a wallet that has a FCA registration. Then, you can just get a little bit of crypto, a small sum, let's say 1-20 dollars/pounds worth of Bitcoin for example and play around on the wallet app, maybe do an exchange  with another crypto to see how it works. Most wallets will show you a history of your transactions, how much you earned or lost ( in percentage) and that will give you an idea about crypto.",

A good exchange will have at least as much Bitcoin in their wallets as the sum of all customer account balances. But many are not very transparent on this front.\n\nSuch certificates or IOUs don't inflate the total supply of Bitcoin. There will still always be no more than 21 million BTC. The big difference between Bitcoin and gold on this front is that it's easy and frictionless to exchange a Bitcoin IOU for real Bitcoin.

It was much more convenient to exchange certificates then to lug around bars of gold or silver. The opposite is true with certificates and bitcoin. Who would want to lug around certificates if you could just have Bitcoin on your phone? The only benefit is if there\u2019s some global catastrophe that shuts down the internet making it difficult to actually transact in bitcoin. Then you could be better of with bullets or silver. \n\nSo fractional reserve banking is less likely with bitcoin because there\u2019s not a fed that can print bitcoin or be a lender of last resort. This is good. The fed was put in place by the banks so they could leverage fewer deposits to make more loans, amplifying their profits without having to worry as much about temporary liquidity needs or bank runs. It\u2019s created inequality, instability, and inflation ever since. 100% reserve banking would eventually be the norm. You\u2019d pay the bank to hold your deposits and if you wanted interest you\u2019d have to agreed to a term deposit for some time period so the bank could invest it. Money would be a true store of value and interest rates would reflect the proper signals to the economy, ie, when interest rates are low that would encourage borrowing because people have saved up for future consumption. When interest rates are high, companies should borrow less because there\u2019s less savings for future consumption and growth. This would be much better than the boom bust cyclicality that the Fed creates.",

This means that for the first time in history, humans have access to a digital form of money that isn\u2019t controlled by a central party.\n\nBitcoin gave us back the amazing powers of independence and financial freedom.\n\n**Great power always comes with great responsibility.**\n\nBitcoin\u2019s transactional finality makes the custodial model obsoleteThe launch of Bitcoin has coincided with new business opportunities and models. The most needed one was providing secure and reliable fiat on and off ramps, also more commonly known as Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nIn order to be tradeable, liquid and easily convertible into fiat currencies, Bitcoin needed online marketplaces. The wishes of bitcoin sellers and buyers are gathered together into a common ledger called an order book. This interaction between buyers and sellers creates the fiat denominated price dynamics of Bitcoin. \n\nThese kinds of Bitcoin exchanges can also be called Custodial Exchanges, which means that the exchange will hold the financial funds (both fiat and bitcoins) of their clients.\n\nThere are some blatant issues and vulnerabilities with that business model.\n\nThe custodial model reproduces the old financial model of banks where all of the clients\u2019 money is held and controlled by a singular entity. Often these funds are held as promises with very little to back them. Many bitcoin exchanges run fraudulent fractional reserves. The problem is that you never know for sure until it\u2019s too late. In 2013, the world\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, we discovered to not hold all of the bitcoin it was supposed to be holding for its clients. And in 2019, Canada\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange, Quadriga, was discovered to be running a similar scheme defrauding many hard working Canadians who trusted them with their savings.\n\nAnd this phenomenon is not unique to bitcoin. History is filled with legacy financial institutions who run fractional reserves. Satoshi said it best himself:\n\n\u201cThe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that\u2019s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.\u201d\n\nTalk is Cheap, Building is Hard\n\nAll modern exchanges will repeat the mantra \u201cNot your keys, not your coins\u201d.\n\nThat famous expression means that if you don\u2019t hold the private keys associated with your Bitcoin wallet, you don\u2019t really own your Bitcoin.\n\nWe take our words seriously.\n\nThat\u2019s why since day one, Bull Bitcoin decided to adopt a non-custodial model to force its users to self-custody by default. This is the real disruption that bitcoin offers the world \u2014 true financial disintermediation and the enabling of a strictly peer to peer money.\n\nIf you\u2019re still holding your coins on an exchange, you should definitely read the rest of this article\u2026\n\n**Seven Reasons Why You Should Self-custody Your Bitcoin**\n\n**1. Custodial exchanges are big honey-pots and they\u2019re constantly targeted by hackers**\n\nIf you\u2019ve been in Bitcoin long enough, you probably heard about important hacks where billions worth of Bitcoins have been stolen.\n\nThe most famous hack happened in 2014, when close to 850,000 bitcoins were supposedly hacked on a Japanese exchange called Mt. Gox.\n\nThese 850,000 bitcoins are worth close to $50 billion USD at the time of writing. Just recently, the plan to compensate Mt. Gox creditors has finally been settled, 7 years after the infamous event. However, only $9 billion will be distributed amongst the creditors.Canada\u2019s Bitcoin Horror Story\n\nCanadians have also had their own exchange horror story. QuadriguaCX was one of the most popular and used Canadian custodial exchanges before its founder and CEO Gerald Cotten suddenly died in India in December 2018.The circumstances of his death are still questioned today. The main issue was that he brought all the necessary access data and private keys of the exchange with him to his grave. \n\nAs a consequence, more than $250 million worth of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are still inaccessible today. It was also discovered that they had been running a fraudulent fractional reserve and didn\u2019t have nearly the amount of client bitcoin deposits they claimed to. Over 100,000 Canadians were affected, and many lost their life savings.\n\nThe story is so strange and interesting that Netflix will soon launch a documentary about it.\n\nIt Happened, and it Will Happen Again\n\nBig hacks are less common today, but you should never put your guard down. It\u2019s only a question of time before the next big hack strikes an exchange. Simply hoping you won\u2019t be a victim is reckless and dangerous.\n\nWithdraw your coins into your own wallet now because it might be too late tomorrow.\n\n**2. Your Own Self-custody Solution is Way More Secure**\n\nSome exchanges have ambiguous security measures to protect the funds of their clients. Some of them won\u2019t even tell you how they\u2019re keeping your coins safe. If you\u2019re not a technical person, you cannot imagine how many possible methods exist to penetrate a custodial exchange to steal clients funds. But most importantly, an account with an exchange is much easier to hack than a private bitcoin wallet.\n\nCheck out the impressive table below to see how varied the attack methods were to hack exchanges since 2011. Some hackers are getting really creative to put their hands on some precious Bitcoin.\n\nVisit the link below to see different cyber security threats to Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nFrom Hodl to Heist: Analysis of Cyber Security Threats to Bitcoin Exchanges, a study done by Kris Oosthoek and Christian Doerr, [https://www.cyber-threat-intelligence.com/publications/ICBC-2020-bitcoinexchangehacks.pdf](https://www.cyber-threat-intelligence.com/publications/ICBC-2020-bitcoinexchangehacks.pdf)\n\nAs you can see, when you\u2019re entrusting an external party to custody your Bitcoin, you simply don\u2019t have any control over it. The expertise necessary to maintain a custodial exchange is extremely advanced and it\u2019s really difficult to evaluate if an exchange maintains high grade security standards. And that\u2019s if they have the bitcoin in the first place!\n\nSelf-custody risks are much more manageable and less costly to fix. There is certainly a learning curve, but the actual technical skillset to securely custody your Bitcoin (even for large quantities) is quite low. In fact, it\u2019s been our experience that the most difficult thing about bitcoin self-custody is gaining the confidence that you\u2019re able to do it. We promise, everyone can!\n\n**The rest of the article in the comments below**",

The scammers will still accept gift cards, moneygram/western union, cash and use mules to accept bank transfers,paypal,etc... but these forms of money are less secure for them than Bitcoin and thus Bitcoin is more efficient. These scam industries have existed before Bitcoin and would continue to exist without bitcoin the same. \n\nThus Bitcoin benefits ethical people (journalists, freedom fighters, those wanting to save money, politically oppressed deplatformed groups, etc..) and unethical people(ransomware, ponzi schemes, etc...) the same because it can be used privately and is very secure.",

I can see the amount on my Ledger but it still says that the transaction is not confirmed yet. When i view the transaction on the explorer it says 2424 confirmations.\n\nI thought that i maybe need to connect and and login with my Ledger to update the status which i did but it still says the same thing.\n\nSo my quesiton now really is if it takes this long for the transaction to be confirmed or if i fucked up somehow? I send the BTC to my Native Segwit account to my Ledger.\n\nThanks for your answers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your suggestions. The problem was solved by doing the following which was suggested by u/TPK001\n\n*\"Sounds like you are all set - except for Ledger Live not showing confirmed.*\n\n*Try this - In Ledger Live, can you click on the \"Gear\" symbol / Settings.*\n\n*Under the Tab - Help, second Item is Clear Cache - that forces a re-synchronization with the blockchain. Hopefully that helps.*\n\n*You dont need the hardware device connected for this.\"*\n\n&#x200B;",

You do not own any Bitcoin but \"IOUs\". (legally you own the bitcoin but practically you don't as the law will not help you in most cases and can and often will be used against you) You have little privacy and your bitcoin is in control of someone else that has their own private keys/seeds which you do not have that reserve your Bitcoin. The bitcoin you own might not exist or may be fractional as well diluting the supply of Bitcoin and decreasing the ability of your investment to appreciate in value. Keeping bitcoin in exchanges also makes Bitcoin more insecure as a whole from attacks and theft. \n\n**Non - Custodial wallets**\n\nYou have the Bitcoin in your private wallet and no one knows your privatekey/seed backup but you. You actually own your own Bitcoin. \n\n------------------------------------------\n**Hot wallets vs Warm Wallets vs Cold wallets**\n\n**Hot wallet** - wallet connected to the internet. \n\nExamples - mobile wallets , web wallets , wallets in exchanges, desktop wallets  \n\n**Warm wallet** - wallet indirectly connected to the internet but a piece of hardware tries to isolate the private keys and transaction signing \n\nExamples - hardware wallets. wallets like cold card with PSBTs offer slightly better security than other HW wallets when used correctly  \n\n**cold wallet** - wallet not connected to the internet \n\nExamples - paper wallets(all new paper wallets should use 12-24 seed words instead of private keys), offline laptop that never connects to the internet with a wallet, , hardware wallets not connected to the internet\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Closed source vs Open source**\n\n**Closed source wallets** - Code for your wallet is not publicly available and auditable by third parties. This allows backdoors and exploits that internal employees or external attackers can exploit and really undermines the security and ideals of decentralization as you must have faith in the company or wallet developers.\n\nWhy use cryptocurrency at all if you have to have faith in a single company or developer?\n\n**Open source wallets** - wallets that allow the source code to be independently audited and peer reviewed and freedom to continue developing the wallet even if the original developers disappear. While not immune from software bugs and exploits (as all code is vulnerable to) open source code gives better transparency and security. You might not be able to understand and audit the code but many other can and will and be able to warn you if a backdoor or exploit exists.\n\nhttps://walletscrutiny.com/",

Let\u2019s add a VPN to the mix, even though I\u2019m not running one, and consider that in an optimized Full Node there are three links in the chain that you have to consider: the OS, the modem, the VPN. This is a \u201cgotcha\u201d because if you fail to consider one of these components, you may not be able to optimize. Further, each of these links, if you think of it as a coin, has two sides: One side is that 8333 is explicitly made open. The other side is that even if 8333 is explicitly made open, another software feature could be blocking it, in which case, you cannot optimize. So, actually, there are six variables to consider: the OS, open versus block; the modem; open versus block; the VPN open versus block.**\n\n**Further on in this post I will describe my initial failures, confusions, and how I fixed the problems.**\n\n**I am running Windows 11 Pro and my modem is ARRIS TG2482. I also run Linux but I choose Windows for some projects and Linux for others (e.g. BOINC).**\n\n**I am proud to say that as a nearly 69 year old retiree in the Dominican Republic, that I am running the only Full Node in this country. I can confirm this at the website: bitnode.io   When you are up and running go to this URL to confirm your status. It has a \u201cCHECK NODE\u201d tool that will tell you if you are receiving connections from other nodes. Hint: If you have configured your modem with a range 1024 and 65535, you will not see that range here. You will simply see \u201c8333\u201d next to your ip address. The tool already \u201csees\u201d your status, so just click on the \u201cCHECK NODE.\u201d If you get a green bar, you can receive data from other nodes; if you get a red bar, you cannot.  For my output I get:  148.103.81.99:8333 /Satoshi:22.0.0/**\n\n**This site also shows the number of running nodes (\\~ 15260) as well as a world map, a list of all countries running nodes, and the number of nodes per country.**\n\n**And much more.**\n\n**CUTTING TO THE CHASE**\n\n**You are thinking about running a BTC Full Node on Windows. (Remember that the source code for the BTC blockchain is open source so that altcoin will each run its own nodes, procedures may be different, etc.)**\n\n**The first step is to eyeball your modem for the make and model and download the manual or quick start if you don\u2019t have it. The manual will tell you your modem\u2019s ip address and the default user name and password. \u201cEnter\u201d your modem\u201d by typing its ip address into a browser. (If you are not online and/or your computer does not have a wi-fi, just connect an ethernet cable to the modem and you will have access. Any configuration changes you make and save in the modem from your computer will occur regardless of your online status).**\n\n**Look for a tab or a menu item that says \u201cfirewall\u201d or \u201cadvanced configuration\u201d or \u201cport forwarding\u201d or \u201cport triggering.\u201d It is mandatory that your modem have the capacity for port forwarding or port triggering. If it doesn\u2019t you cannot optimize your node and must buy a new modem and have your ISP provision it. Many ISP\u2019s will list compatible modems on their website. You can then download the manuals of various ones to see which have advanced configuration.**\n\n**Doing it. Problems, Confusions, and Solutions.**\n\n**To set up, I turned off my modem\u2019s firewall. YMMV. My modem had two different menus: one for port forwarding and one for port triggering. Since you can use either one, choose the simplest one. For me, that was port forwarding. The first thing I could see was that it was not possible to open port 8333 because there was no field in which to put a single port, that there were only fields to express a range, so I put in 1024 and 65535. For the ARRIS modem there were clickable \u201chelps\u201d which told me that for both incoming and outgoing ranges, that they would be the same, so I put in these values for both incoming and outgoing. That doesn\u2019t make sense to me but that\u2019s how it was. Besides inputting a name, the only other field was for my ip address. For that I opened Windows Search < Command Prompt and typed in  ipconfig. Then I saved all and logged out of my modem.**\n\n**Then, to be on the safe side, I rebooted both my computer and the modem. After that, I went to Bitcoin Core Information tab and saw \u201c0 in; 10 out.\u201d Problem! I\u2019m not optimized even though I configured my modem. Did I make a mistake in the config.?**\n\n**Then from the same tab I opened my Debug log file. Remember to scroll DOWN for the present time. If you read data from the top, you are looking at the past time.**\n\n**Here I discovered \u201cNew outbound peer connected.\u201d This is good. My modem is configured correctly! But confusing too. If my info tab shows \u201c0\u201d in, I\u2019d expect to see \u201cNew inbound peer connected.\u201d What is going on? I think that \u201coutbound peer connected\u201d means that I am now connected to other nodes. THEIR DATA IS OUTGOING FOR THEM BUT INCOMING TO ME. So the log should NOT say \u201cinbound peer connected.\u201d**\n\n**But I still have a problem. The Bitcoin Core is a program designed for Windows OS. It is embedded in Windows, the registry, etc. So although Windows is showing via my log that I\u2019m connected to outbound peers, I\u2019m not receiving data from outbound peers.**\n\n**And here\u2019s a reminder of the \u201cGotcha!\u201d that you have to consider the three links in the chain: the OS, the modem, the VPN; and not only port forwarding but port blocking.**\n\n**So now I have a hunch that Windows is blocking my incoming data (showing \u201c0\u201d on the info tab).**\n\n**I go to Settings < Privacy & Security < Firewall & Network Protection. Lo and behold! I have THREE firewalls turned on. I disable: Domain network firewall; Private network firewall; Public network firewall. Disable and apply and ignore Windows\u2019 warnings. Whether you need to disable all three: YMMV.**\n\n**Then I reboot, after shutting down CORE, then re-start Core (I turn off autostart and prefer manual stat), go to Info tab and see In: 14/ Out: 10! I go to Network Traffic and for the first time I get two real time graphs, green received and red sent. And at bitnodes.io I am recognized and get a green bar. Success! I have optimized! Needless to say, I still had \u201cfailure\u201d after a proper modem config. because of an OS block.**\n\n**\\*\\*Full Node optimization. Turns out that before I optimized I was still running a Full Node but a lesser Full Node. A Full Node is made up of different components. If you run 1 but not > than 1 you are still running a Full Node but less that optimized. Analogy: Given an identified music composition that you are listening to on your computer, the name of the composition is the same, but you can alter it qualitatively by adding or subtracting data, say by using the DAC soldered onto your motherboard versus buying an independent external DAC and bypassing the inferior one. The name of the composition is the same (Full Node) but the qualitative degrees are different\u2014same in kind, different in degree, if you will.**\n\n**You can see the various components of BTC Full Node when you look at your peers\u2019 data per individual. These are the permutations possible:**\n\n**Inbound  (This is me before)**\n\n**Outbound Full Relay (This is me after)**\n\n**Network**\n\n**Bloom**\n\n**Witness**\n\n**Network Limited**\n\n**One peer may run 1 or more of the above. I guess it\u2019s obvious why I am NOT listed as a peer here. To see my \u201ccomponent\u201d status as a peer, I go to bitnode.io and I find out that my services are: node witness and node network limited (1032).** ***Service*** **is the correct word, so I will substitute that for \u201ccomponent.\u201d**\n\n**I\u2019m sure that further service tweaks are possible and I will investigate those as time goes on.**",

If you hold cash, banks inflate its value away. Bitcoin does not have this problem. 21 Million. That's it.\n\n- Banks keep things digital and moving fast, lugging gold or trying to send cash to someone over the internet is not convenient. Bitcoin is already digital.\n\nTHERE IS NO REASON TO KEEP BITCOIN ON EXCHANGES AND EVERY REASON TO MOVE THEM OUT!\n\nCoinbase can't freeze funds in a personal wallet like:\n- BlueWallet\n- Muun Wallet\n- Phoenix Wallet\n- Cold Card\n- Trezor\n- etc.",

They aren\u2019t a blockchain, aren\u2019t decentralized, and aren\u2019t what Bitcoin is supposed to be about. Decentralization also means that individuals are free to decide how to use their funds as they please and that doesn\u2019t mean it dictates how anyone else uses their Sats. CB is basically one user making a decision. The millions of other users don\u2019t have to follow their lead although they can *if they want* because they\u2019re free to do so. That doesn\u2019t impede anyone\u2019s ability to use BTC. \n\nBitcoin is not about day trading and definitely not about letting someone else \u201ccontrol\u201d your Sats which is what anyone who leaves their coins on an exchange is doing.

Every coin circulating on DeFi networks are unchecked by their participants which renders the concept of \"tainted\" useless after a certain amounts of hops.

A Coinjoin mixes your coins with those of several (preferably many) participants creating multiple outputs in such a way that it is impossible to follow the thread. It will be known that the coins you took out of the exchange (which were at your address bc1xXx) were put into a Coinjoin, but it will not be known, out of the tens or hundreds of output addresses, which one is yours, so no one will be able to prove that you own those coins. Almost more important than how to coinjoin, you need to know how to spend those bitcoins (post-mixing spending strategy) or you may inadvertently undo the privacy gained by improper use of those coins. \n\nHowever, even if nobody knows if those BTC are yours (not even if you still have them), what they can know is that you had them, and you will not be able to erase that trace. \n\nAlthough it may seem that erasing the trace of our coins in the blockchain is something we do either to commit criminal activities or to hide our wealth from the tax authorities, a perfectly valid and legitimate explanation for the use of coinjoin is to protect your transaction history from those people you have paid. \n\nIf you have 10BTC in an address and you send one BTC to me, I can see in the transaction that 9 BTC have been returned as change to yourself, and consequently know how much money you have and what you are going to do with it from now on. A coinjoin protects you from a person to whom you once paid something to be able to audit all your movements.",

Most people are pulling their assets out of Russia due to the war. Where as almost no one is wanting to buy. So the supply is high and the demand is low. Meaning there is a surplus. This is economics 101, the law of supply and demand.\n\nSo do you think there will be demand for bitcoin in the future? The supply of bitcoin is currently almost 19 million and it will never be more than 21 million. So all that matters is demand in this case. If you don't believe the demand will go up then you probably shouldn't be buying bitcoin in the first place. \n\nPrice is correlated with demand. As demand goes up so to will the price.",

The thing really important is the recovery seed, as that is to be used to gain access to your funds if the wallet breaks or gets lost, then you only need to put the seed into another wallet. A hardware wallet or a software wallet. Anything that support the bip39 protocol.\n\nSo the seed is the most important thing. The wallet less so.\n\nIf anything goes into the safe, then it mainly should be the recovery seed.\n\nAlso having a hardware wallet (or even multiple) with a passphrase, makes things even more safe, besides a PIN. As not only you'd require the wallet but also a passphrase to access  a wallet (each wallet would get its own passphrase, even the default wallet, as it would have an empty passphrase when enabling passphrase usage). So if a wallet is stolen, even if they get past the PIN, they still would have to enter the passphrase belonging to each wallet, as bip39 supports a very large amount of wallets to be created from one seed. At least one additional wallet besides the default wallet passphrase less wallet, would make it more secure.\n\nSo please forget the notion of having any coins on the wallet. You don't. Ever... Only the seed is on it, nothing else (albeit that ledger installs some apps on it as well to enable specific coins if I recall correctly?).\n\nHeck you could even have the same seed on multiple devices to access your funds... a good thing also yo get the hang of it, is to actually recover the seed into a wallet..a software wallet or another hardware wallet, of the same model or even another make altogether. So to feel comfortable to perform a recovery, getting the idea that the wallet itself doesn't matter. Only the seed does.\n\nThis means also to never ever ever ever hand out the seed to anyone. Ever. Especialy not to websites that any of the scammers that would already be DMing you will be asking you, to \"sync\" your wallet to solve \"problems\", which will only result in your funds to be stolen...",

The phrase \"I want to store my bitcoin in a hardware wallet\" it's technically wrong. That's because bitcoins aren't stored anywhere, it's just their ownership that's recorded on the blockchain (i.e. addres 1p5hc... has 1.5 BTC).\n\nSo what is stored in the wallet then? The private key. Each account (or address) has its own private key which is needed to SPEND (aka send to another address) those bitcoins. So actually, in your hardware wallet you are storing the cryptographic key that allows you to spend those bitcoins (that's why you keep it offline, if anyone steals it from you, they can spend your bitcoins).\n\nTo receive bitcoins you don't need the private key, you just need the public one (aka the address, the one that starts with either 1 or 3), so no need to plug your HW anywhere.\n\nHope I've been clear\n\n\nYou can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSTiKjnBaes) if it's still not clear",

For the many non-English non-technical people around the world, this adds an extra layer of complexity to an already unfamiliar process. If you needed to secure or memorize their seed phrase, imagine how much more difficult things would be if your seed phrase was for example 24 random Hindi words, in an alphabet that you didn't even recognize.\n\nI was wondering if anyone has seen a good solution to this. I know there are the Spanish and French versions of the BIP49 word list but I am pretty sure no wallet uses them, and always default to English seed words. \n\nThe only solution I can think of is a word for word translation of the original English list to be made available, but I haven't seen any online nor does it   doesn't sound very practical.",

Specifically, if you were worried about your bank account being frozen (like during the Trucker Protests in Canada), Bitcoin is supposed to be your salvation in such a situation.\n\nBut after asking these questions and reading the responses, it really seems to me like just having a safe in your house with a bunch of cash in it would be far more useful in such a situation than having an equivalent amount of Bitcoin. There just aren't that many situations where you can rely on P2P transactions, and the state can easily police the boundary between Bitcoin and fiat (exchanges, POS devices, eCommerce, etc).\n\nDo I have this wrong? What am I missing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Lots of good dialogue here. FWIW, I wanted to flag that most answers seem to be focusing on the 'inflation proof store of value' benefit of Bitcoin here, and not enough on the 'unfreezeable decentralized currency' benefit of Bitcoin. I understand that if you are a Russian citizen and you sunk your life's savings into Bitcoin in January, the value of that life savings would be in tact today. But, I still haven't been convinced you'd be able to do much to feed yourself/your family today with all that Bitcoin.",

Also, above about $50k, cash is not so portable. Carrying cash has a greater risk of loss by theft. Gold bars would be more portable, up to the point where the weight is greater than 10kg. And gold bars can be confiscated in any airport. The world isn't connected by land transport, and even where it is, gold and cash will be confiscated at international borders\n\n> What am I missing?\n\nYou're arbitrarily denying the convenience of face-to-face selling, \"There just aren't that many situations where you can rely on P2P transactions\". If you're frightened of meeting strangers, Bitcoin won't suit your personality\n\n> the state can easily police the boundary between Bitcoin and fiat (exchanges, POS devices, eCommerce)\n\nNot eCommerce, with a caveat. Right now, you can spend Bitcoin to buy a virtual gift card worth $200 or more to spend in a store. These transactions - buying the card, spending the card - are not monitored. The caveat is that they're not monitored because the amounts are low enough not to be a money-laundering risk. You'll be able to buy groceries and home hardware forever, but you'll never buy a new car  \n\nTo circle back to your \"cash in the safe\" claim, the same applies. You're not going to buy a new car with $50k of cash from your safe. That transaction is monitored  \n\nIf you're trying to launder millions quickly, there will be barriers, both for cash and Bitcoin. Bitcoin is fine for daily living expenses, more convenient to store and carry, less convenient to use\n\n> Russia\n\nProbably not. The \"Bitcoin fixes this\" mantra is parroted by people who don't see that money needs to cycle. International sanctions prevent fiat from moving into and out of Russia. So the Bitcoin held by Russians is stuck in Russia. There might be an opportunity to travel to a Euro country, maybe Finland or Greece, sell Bitcoin for Euros and smuggle Euro cash into Russia. See that Bitrefill has sold out of most cards: https://www.bitrefill.com/buy/russia/  \n\nA man can't feed his family with Fortnite bux  \n\nIn a mass adoption scenario, the Bitcoin holder can spend at the grocery store, the grocery store pays its suppliers with Bitcoin, pays its staff wages, rent and electricity with Bitcoin  \n\nBut mass adoption seems unlikely, after 13 years\n\nFWIW, Venezuela has a longer history of \"Bitcoin fixes this\". On the one hand, the localbitcoins transaction volumes for Venezuela are regularly published, and it's true that expatriates send Bitcoin to their families. On the other hand, nobody in Venezuela can use Bitcoin to pay for groceries. Bitcoin use is real in Venezuela, on a very small scale",

If you are in Rusia now, BTC won't do you any good, but as soon as you flee from your country you are in a very different situation. You can flee to Bolivia or where ever carrying a billion rubles but they will be useless in your new home, but if you flee carrying BTC you can easily exchange them in your new, safe, home and they will still hold their value (pending fluctuations of BTC but that's another matter). So, yeah, they are extremely useful if you become a refugee!\n\nWhat's more, BTC are easy to carry along with you. You do not need any electronics or anything, as long as you write down your key words on a scrap of paper (or needcase memorize them, make a song out of them, whatever), you're good. Once you are back in a safe place with good electronics, all you need to do is open a wallet and import those key words and you've got your BTC back!\n\nTry fleeing your country with hundreds of kilo's of gold or large piles of dollars! Much easier to run with just one small scrap of paper with twenty four words on it!",

Less than three decades later we have what we have now. Same with electricity back in the late 1800s- no use the first couple of decades, then now everything is plugged in to electricity. So though in times of crisis (war) it may seem useless now, it is that very crisis which will accelerate the innovation.\n\nAnd What is the innovation of BTC you may ask? For the first time ever in humanity, we were able to create a digital form of property that is zero sum and does not need a central figure to do that for you. This has profound downstream implications for our use of the internet and electricity pushing humanity forward pnce again.",

My suggestion is to try investing with money that you can 100% lose and not mind, and back that up with learning.\nBitcoin is, like all other assets, a supply and demand based price. If more people want it, the price trends up, and vice versa. What we see with the Ukraine conflict is volatility (big price changes) in lots of assets, so people will invest more heavily in \"safe\" assets, such as gold. This pulls money away from more risky assets like bitcoin.\nIt used to be the case that the prices didn't match up, but now that the number of investors has increased and become more mainstream, it is following the mainstream patterns of other high risk assets.",

There is an important political movement you want to be an active part of, but the ruling administration doesn't like it. So, they've deployed their now tried-and-tested method of knee capping such movements: they begin freezing the accounts of those identified as supporting the movement. So, you find one morning that your fiat accounts have all been frozen. You have no access to traditional banking services.\n\nBut, you were prepared for this! You have tucked away several months expenses worth of BTC on a reliable cold storage wallet. No state agency knows your addresses, so there is nothing for them to attempt to 'freeze' or 'lock out'. Great!\n\nSo....now what?\n\nBest case scenario: you can find local retailers that accept BTC payments, and the state has been too slow or too incompetent to prevent you from using your BTC to pay for things. If so, great. But more likely, in such a scenario, the state has ordered retailers to stop accepting BTC payments from everyone, or has gotten their hooks into the payment providers and forced them all to KYC, in which case you're not going to be able to pay for goods/services with BTC directly.\n\nYou could look for individuals willing to sell you goods/services in exchange for P2P BTC, but that's going to be very hard to find. Ditto for people willing to do F2F BTC purchases in cash.\n\nSo, now what? How do you use your carefully tucked away BTC on your cold storage wallet to weather the storm? Is there a way, or are you just screwed?",

Their cost to buy on strike and send to a hardware wallet beats any exchange fees. It is also very easy to preform the transaction. The only down side is a 2k weekly limit. So no lump sum buys, but you wanted to DCA anyways.\n\nCold wallet is the best because it is the safest. Trezor & Ledger are great. Cold Card once. You get advanced. Also a metal backup seed plate is a good idea. \n\nThis is the safest way to store your bitcoin short of a dual signature.",

They allow you to purchase bitcoin and withdraw it to any wallet you choose. \n\n2) Get a hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger, ColdCard etc). The single most important thing to remember with these wallets is that the device itself is replaceable. What matters is the backup \u201cseed\u201d they generate during setup. Keep that seed safe. It is everything. \n\n3) Store the seed in a non-electronic format. For decades-long storage you should stamp/engrave it into durable metal plates. There are a variety of products for this or you can do it yourself with parts from a hardware store. (More info: https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/)",

Telling him that the virus was going to wipe out every single bank account, unless this \"agent\" helped him.  He had to act now, and he had to take all his money out and put it in crypto currency where it would be safe.  They told him not to tell anyone and that the virus was \"listening\" to his phone calls, so he had to use someone else's phone while doing this.  They were able to drain one bank account, but they couldn't immediately drain the other one since it takes about 24 hrs to make such a large withdrawal.  We were able to stop that withdrawal thank God, but they are supposed to call him today with instructions on how to move all of his money into a crypto \"safe place\".  \n\nI tell you guys, my blood was boiling.  Not surprised about the scam \"steps\" that they used, but I was really surprised that he fell for it.

It's always been my understanding that only selling or trading for another currency was considered a \"taxable event.\" But they're trying to tell me that transferring from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro and then to my own wallet, were all taxable based on the price at the time of the transfer.\n\nI did the tax assistant thing on Coinbase that sent me to CoinTracker, who sent me an 8949. Is this just to show the activity and will not affect my taxes or is this indeed showing that transferring counts as a sale and taxable event? We didn't finish everything as they wanted to consult one of their other accountants who does more in the crypto area, so I am waiting to hear back.\n\n**UPDATE:** Got everything sorted out. Thank you to anyone that suggested CryptoTrader and redoing my 8949.\n\nIssue #1 was the CoinTracker integration with Coinbase Pro did not work correctly, so my numbers were off (still not exactly sure how). CryptoTrader worked perfectly though. Cost me $45, but if I tried to fix CoinTrader, it would have cost me $90.\n\nIssue #2 was obviously my accountant not having the full knowledge on how this stuff worked, but I sent her the info from the IRS website and other places, so hopefully no one else runs into this sort of issue in the future going to them.\n\nThank you for all the input, I appreciate it and hope others found the information useful for their tax worries.",

Any country eliminating cash and switching to CBDC are simply forcing people to use Bitcoin instead as well",

Start with a small transfer/purchase/exchange and make sure you can make all the steps work. the idea of starting asap is there may be unforseen pitfalls or waiting periods so do a tiny one asap and test it. \n\n[https://paxful.com/buy/bitcoin/russia](https://paxful.com/buy/bitcoin/russia)\n\nOnce it's BTC in his wallet he's free and clear of any Russian control. It likely easiest for him to 'deposit' the BTC from his wallet into an exchange the works in the USA  like coinbase/FTX/binance.us , and then he can withdraw it to his US bank account and then just use his US funds while in Austria.",

Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. \n\n\nThere are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties\n\nYou are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft \n\nYou are exposed to exit theft \n\nYou are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit\n\nYou place Bitcoin as a whole under more systemic risk by tempting exchanges to use fractional reserve banking and giving them too much influence\n\nYou potentially reduce the probability that your investment will appreciate in value because no exchanges are doing provable audits and they might be fractional. The more Bitcoin you personally control the more likely it will appreciate in value.\n\n**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet, custodian , or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.** \n\n\n-----------------------------\n\n\nYou should avoid that exchange as they are running various ponzi's with their tokens and have absurd withdraw fees of 0.0005 btc where other exchanges have free withdrawals",

Most of my understanding of bitcoin comes from this article.\n\nhttps://michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/\n\nNow, I've been reading more about bitcoin trying to understand it better and I'm kind of stumbling over the concept of nodes and block size.\n\nIf I understand what I'm reading correctly, nodes are simply users.  In other words, Alice and Charlie in the article I posted above have a full node. \n\nNodes are significant in that they can broadcast transactions and contain a full history of the blockchain, and can thus audit the blockchain independently.  Nodes broadcast transactions on the internet, and miners can use their proof of work to confirm that the transactions are valid.  \n\nNodes, however, can chose which miner can validate transactions.  If enough nodes and miners separate from the bitcoin consensus, that creates a fork.\n\nSo..... some questions.\n\n1) Is this explanation right?\n\n2a) Let's say I download Exodus wallet.  Do I have a full node?  If I don't, what do I have?  \n\n2b) If I don't have a full node, then I suspect that there a company that runs Exodus wallet that runs a full node, and thus, broadcasts my transactions for me.  Is that the case?\n\n3) How would an increase in blocksize from 1MB to, say, 8MB effect my ability to audit a blockchain or run a node?  A block is just a list of transactions right?  So why doesn't 8 1mb node = 1 8mb block?  (As you see, I don't know shit about shit).  \n\nThank you very much for your help.",

Bitcoin is a volatile currency and until bitcoin becomes less volatile than fiat currency (may happen in time) than stores and paychecks will naturally be denominated in fiat terms as a unit of account , and than accept btc in a small 1-10 min window price conversion. \n\n>If not then it\u2019s just another form of the US dollar. \n\nJust because a store does their accounting in US dollars does not mean that bitcoin is another form of the US dollar. This would be akin to someone paying a company in euros and you calling euros as another form of the dollar just because the store decides to do their accounting in dollars which is nonsensical. If stores did their accounting in Bitcoin would you call fiat just some other form of bitcoin?\n\nSome stores will simply use bitcoin as a payment rail and autodump for fiat, other stores will convert a % to fiat to pay suppliers/employees but keep some in bitcoin , and other stores will accept btc directly and never convert to fiat.",

Sincerely, I want to understand how all of this cryptocurrency works and take control of my currency myself!\n\nUsing Kraken, I bought some BTCs and transferred them to an Exodus Wallet.

I think I understand this pretty good, maybe.\n\nUltimately, I want to put my BTC into cold storage, but I need to understand a few things. I cannot find specific answers to these questions and getting burned out watching the mostly terrible, how to videos on YT.\n\nThese questions are all interrelated, so, probably there is a way to answer the questions in a single, simple explanation that answers them all.\n\nQuestions: \n\nIs it possible to transfer my BTC to a new wallet using that 12 word password from Exodus? Like download a new wallet, put in the 12 words, and boom, there is my BTC in the new wallet.\n\nWhen people say they are putting their BTC into \"Cold Storage\", is that the 12 word password? Or is there something else it stores?\n\nI read people saying they memorize their 12 word (or more) password so they always have their BTC safe. So, if I memorize my 12 word password, am I able to open it into any new wallet I get? \n\nCan I cold storage my BTC in my head)? So, I have a software wallet that people can pay me in BTC, while All my BTC is stored in my head?\n\nUltimately, I would like to memorize my 12 word password and use my brain as the cold storage.

            "selftext": "I made my first BTC purchases on the weekend and have some questions about makers and takers. I think I understand how it works but would appreciate the clarification. \n\nOn exchanges where the Taker fee is higher than the Maker fee (I\u2019m using Kraken) I\u2019d prefer to be charged the lower fee obviously. So I need to purchase using the \u201cLimit\u201d option and set my limit lower than the current market price to incur the Maker fee. This means that the BTC price needs to fall before my purchase can take place right?  So there is no way to purchase as a Maker if the price is rising?\n\nAnd if I do a \u201cMarket\u201d purchase that will always be charged the Taker fee right?\n\nIf I want to purchase a larger amount of BTC but don\u2019t want to wait for the price to fall (resigned to being charged Maker fee) can I set the limit at the current price or even just above - which would make my bid execute immediately but limit what I\u2019m prepared to pay if the market shifts higher quickly? And if that\u2019s the case am I just charged a Maker fee for the whole purchase (because my limit was set above the market price) regardless of whether the market is above or below my limit when each portion is fulfilled?\n\nFinally, if only part of my purchase is fulfilled can I just cancel the other part without affecting what I\u2019ve already purchased? I assume I can just leave it sitting there too (depending on the buy options) but it may never get completed if the market doesn\u2019t come down to that price again right?",

I'll try my best to break this down for you :)\n\nThe maker and taker model is a way to differentiate fees between trade orders that provide liquidity (\"maker orders\") and take away liquidity (\"taker orders\"). Maker and taker trade orders are charged different fees.\n\n**Maker order -**   \nA trade order gets the \u200bmaker\u200b fee if the trade order is not matched immediately against an order already on the order book, which adds liquidity\u200b. So whenever you post a limit order below the current market price, your order will add liquidity to the order book therefore Maker fees will be levied onto it.\n\n**Taker order -**  \nA trade order gets the \u200btaker\u200b fee if the trade order is matched immediately against an order already on the order book, which removes liquidity\u200b. All market orders will execute immediately, and will be charged the taker fee.\n\nNow to answer your question -\n\n1. If you place a limit order above the current market price of the asset your order will act as a market order and it will execute immediately.\n2. Let's say an asset is trading at $100. You put a huge quantity limit order to buy the asset for $105. Your order will fill immediately for the volume available on the order book till $105. This will act as a market order and taker fees will be levied onto it. If your buy order is too big for the order book to fill at $105 then the remaining portion of your order will show up on order book on the bid side at $105 and that portion will be levied maker fees since it helped create more liquidity on the order book.\n3. You can absolutely cancel your order if it's partially filled without affecting what you have already purchased.\n\nFew helpful links -\n\n1.

[Market and Limit orders](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/203325783)\n\nI hope I was able to answer your query,  \nPluto \ud83d\udc19",

I've had it connected to a pool and running now for about 24 hours and everything looks OK to my eyes, but my address shows 0 BTC so far. I figure at some point I'll see that tick up to 0.00000001 BTC or something like that. But does anyone know how long I should expect to wait before I see that?

Only the signatures require private keys. The hardware wallet is a computer. It is designed to prevent the private keys leaking to the computer it's plugged into. The signing process only occurs within the hardware wallet. Then the signed transaction moves onto the computer to be broadcast  \n\nSome models of hardware wallet do not need to be plugged in. Some of them use a uSD card to copy the unsigned transaction to the wallet, and copy the signed transaction to the online computer. Other models have a small screen and camera, so that the transactions can be copied via QR code",

It is just a utility to manage addresses and talk with the network (ideally through your own node). \nOn the other hand you have a signing device \u2014 which holds and secures the private key and signs the transactions. The key never leaves the device and some of those devices actually never touch/connect to a computer directly (air gaped) but communicate via SD-card or QR code.\n\ntherefore even if your wallet management software is corrupted, it has no access to the private key but can trick you into sending to an address which the attacker controls \u2014 by swapping it out during transaction construction.\n\nSigning devices always show you the tx details before signing. Therefore ALWAYS verify the transaction addresses on the signing device.",

If I buy one bitcoin, then transfer it from Coinbase to a wallet, how do I use it?  Like if I wanted to send you 1 BTC from my Coinbase account I get it - just give me your address and I know how to send.   If my bitcoin is in a wallet, doesn't it have to reconnect to an exchange to be sent to another person?\n\nI can't conceive how I would be able to send from my non-exchange wallet to your non-exchange wallet.\n\nAny quick answers or feedback would be appreciated. More importantly, what' a good resource where I can learn more and close this knowledge gap?\n\nI look at the website of the wallet companies and they talk about their security features, but now how the concept actually works...\n\nThank you.",

Sometimes the term is used to refer to the software that manages your funds. Sometimes it's referred to as the set of private keys that are associated with your funds.\n\nNote that at any point you only need the private keys, because the software can always compute the public keys and addresses on the fly if needed.\n\n1. The public key has very little actual value for a regular user. The public key makes an appearance when you spend the funds from an address. The transaction that spends these funds reveals the public key. But the software will manage that for you. So unless you're handcrafting transactions (why though?), you won't ever need to actually have the public key written down or stored somewhere. Whenever it's needed, it's a simple step to compute it from the private key.\n\n2. There are probably tools that let you do that. You don't need it though.\n\n3. Each address comes with it's own private key, so if you need a new address, you need a new private key. Which brings me to my final point:\n\nDo not use something like bitaddress.org unless you know exactly what you're doing (which as a newbie, you probably don't). It's easy to make mistakes and to either have your keys compromised or lost.\n\nThe practice of printing keys on pieces of paper has been superseded by more convenient and secure methods. Most wallet applications (hardware and software) these days use a standard that lets you generate as many private keys (and associated addresses) from a single secret \"seed\". This seed is represented by a sequence of 12, 18 or 24 words (usually 24). You can write down these words and store them in a secure location as a backup, while the seed is stored in the software wallet (note: any sensitive data on a connected device is a security risk, use with small amounts of funds only) or in the secure chip of the hardware wallet.",

Experimenting and learning is great.\n\n> This is what I'm trying to find out. What is that simple step?\n\nIt's a simple step for a computer, not for us meatbags. The public key is computed from the private key using elliptic curve cryptography. There are probably some good resources out there on the math behind that. But if you just want to know the public key, you can just use bitaddress.org and go to the tab \"Wallet Details\". Here you can enter a private key (don't do this on an online device if the private key holds non-trivial amounts of funds) and have it calculate the associated public key.\n\n> \"Unlike a bank account, one wallet can have multiple receiving addresses generated by its public key.\"\n\nThis is wrong. A private key generates one public key which in turn generates one public address.\n\nWallet applications can manage a set of private keys, each with its own public key and address.\n\nIn the past, private keys were generated by just taking a random number. So with each new private key generated by the application, you'd have to update your backups. Most modern wallets (software or hardware) use the BIP39 standard to generate all private keys from a \"master private key\" (the seed) using some fancy math. With this system, you only back up the seed once (in the convenient form of 12-24 regular words) and your wallet application can generate as many private keys and associated addresses as you like.",

(Very private transactions ). Other benefits include being able to send for fees of a fraction of a penny, send amounts as low as 1/1000 of a satoshi, and have instant confirmations. Lightning allows Bitcoin to scale to millions of transactions per second and what allows whole countries like El Salvador to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. \n\nI suggest you read the pinned FAQ where 2 recommended lighting wallets exist , of any of these - \nhttps://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets",

I suggest you investigate lightning wallets , coinjoin , payjoin , and new tricks like \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/t3gy74/teleport_a_coinswap_implementation_alpha_release/\n\nThe real question is if you need immediate privacy for a transaction/purchase that requires it today or you are concerned about long term privacy ?",

To simplify it, let's pretend all 21 million Bitcoin have been mined and exist (which won't happen in real life for decades.)\n\nSomeone buys 1 BTC on an exchange for $1 in our fictional scenario. At that moment, the market cap of Bitcoin is $21 million - however, not everyone wants to sell their bitcoin for $1. Let's say someone puts in another order to buy a bitcoin at $1 - but no one wants to sell for that price. The next best price is $1.50 - and finally the person who wants to buy moves their offer to $1.50 and the trade goes through - the market cap is now $31.5 million.\n\nSo the market cap is really their guess at the total value of all Bitcoin based on the last few trades at a certain price.\n\nIt doesn't mean all Bitcoin is worth that - as demand to buy more increases, the sellers could ask for more money and the price would rise. No one could ever own all the Bitcoin because some are lost forever.",

Bitcoin was never pre mined, was distributed equally and fairly and is totally and completely decentralized.  This will never happen again to any new crypto currency.  Bitcoin is used as legal tender and is a form of true currency all over the globe.  That cant just be replaced\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the one thing I am confident will never happen",

Read Mastering [Mastering Bitcoin](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Programming-Open-Blockchain/dp/1491954388/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1645862646&sr=8-1) first, this is the best introduction, I'm currently livestreaming my experience with it on my YT channel.\n\nWhile reading the above get an audible account and listen to Inventing Bitcoin, when you have spare time.\n\nI would also recommend listening to the block size wars as well. \n\nThis is also a great time to learn how to setup a node from scratch, I have a walkthrough [here](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/Bitcoin-FullNode-Setup) showing you how to set it up with a raspberry pi. This will allow you to follow along with the examples in Mastering Bitcoin.\n\n3. Read [Programming Bitcoin](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=programming+bitcoin&crid=1ZXIW4S25YIY3&sprefix=programmin%2Caps%2C93&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10), in this book you will learn how to create Bitcoin from scratch using python. I recommend re-listening to Inventing Bitcoin during this to refresh yourself on the big ideas again.\n\n4. Read [Mastering Lightning](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Lightning-Network-Blockchain-Protocol/dp/1492054860/ref=sr_1_3?crid=12FXJOJ8BXV6Y&keywords=mastering+lightning+network&qid=1645863259&sprefix=mastering+light%2Caps%2C87&sr=8-3) this is by the author of the first book and will give a solid understanding of the lightning network. I also recommend listending to the audiobook Layered Money before or while you're reading this book to get a deeper understanding of building in layers.\n\nTips:\n\nAvoid BitSoy and BitSoy clones all together, really all YouTubers except for maybe Robert Breedlove's podcast, and some of Jack Maller's interviews.\n\nUnderstand Bitcoin is not written in any particular programming language, it's just a set of rules and a big distributed database. However the reference implementation called Bitcoin Core is written in C++, and most node providers use that as the standard.",

Sounds like a wild storm out that way.\n\nI've been watching videos and reading articles but am still confused when it comes to the bitcoin hard wallets and was hoping someone could help out.\n\nRight now I have $10K in my bank account ready to purchase how ever many bitcoin that comes out to be at the time based on cost.  I've opened a Coinbase account to move the $10K to from my bank to facilitate the purchase.  I know that after the purchase I know own $10K worth of bitcoin.  \n\nWhat I don't get is how the hard wallet comes into play.  I'm planning on getting the Ledger Nano X as soon as I figure this out.  \n\nSo after I make the purchase how would I move the bitcoin to the Nano?  Or am I missing something at this point?\n\nAlso, I've heard about debit cards through Coinbase and such that you can use to pay in bitcoin rather that cash.  With the wild fluxuations in BTC price, and the story of the $7M pizza that I've heard about, is it wize to pay in bitcoin yet, or wait until it becomes more stable?  I see videos a lot of people in Asian countries paying in bitcoin for a lot of things, but again I must be missing something to understand how a thing then is not $5 on minute and $25 the next, if you know what I mean.  \n\nI hope you all can help me out.  I've done a lot of my own study but feel I'm missing just small pieces to put it all together.  The kids are too bright these days.  lol.  Oldies like me could use a bitcoin manual.  lol.  (I'm 51 btw)\n\nThanks for the help everyone!  I look forward to your replies.",

Once you purchase your Bitcoin on Coinbase Pro, you need to send the Bitcoin to your hardware wallet for safe storage. The hardware wallet stores your private keys so you truly own your own Bitcoin at that point. There is a \"send\" function on CBP and a receive function on Ledger Live app. You can watch a youtube video or Ledger tutorial on how to do this. Make sure you do a small transfer first just to make sure everything goes smoothly. \n\nHonestly, it sounds a lot more complicated than it actually is. Once you go through it, its super simple. I'd recommend checking out The CryptoDad on Youtube, he has some really excellent walk through videos on doing exactly what you are explaining. \n\n[https://youtu.be/aR7KU1vuzaE](https://youtu.be/aR7KU1vuzaE)",

You have a text on the coinbase screen that says there is 1BTC in your account but that is simply a promise from coinbase that when you want to withdraw that bitcoin they will give it to you, in the same way that when you see in your online banking that you have a balance of $100 it is really just a text on a screen. You will get it when you go to the ATM and withdraw that $100 and hold it in your hand.\n\nBitcoin is digital cash. You can't hold it in your hand like $100 because it's digital, but you can POSSESS it. A hardware wallet generates a private key that only you know, and from that private key it creates addresses, where you can send the btc you have in coinbase.\n\nThen, you will own that bitcoin, because the private key that holds it is only in your possession. Not even the ledger has it, because the private key is generated offline and only in your device (you will write down some words in a paper that encode that private key, and that paper is the only way in the world to recover your bitcoin if something happens to the ledger).\n\nIf you die and no one ever finds that paper, that bitcoin is lost forever.\n\nIn my opinion, because bitcoin is in a revaluation process given its scarcity (there are only 21,000,000 and no more) I would not use them for spending, unless you wanted to use it for something you are not allowed to do with your dollars. If you can save them and avoid spending them you are likely to have a nice reward in the future, but of course this is a personal opinion.\n\nThere are no shortcuts to understanding bitcoin, it takes study and it is not easy, but it is very stimulating.",

                    "response": "It's not a silly question. It's an EXCELLENT question for someone who wants to be in control of their money.\n\nWhen you first set up a hardware wallet you go through an initialization process to generate a big random number. That random number is expanded a bit to create a *seed*, which is the starting point for an algorithm that derives every private key and public key that wallet will ever need. If the device breaks, you can recreate the wallet by initializing a new one with the same seed instead of starting from a new random number. \n\nBut humans make mistakes. If you had to enter a seed in the form of a big decimal number like `2200932566259223705129332787816966579226199762185320319699140807282041335045735369056543064228447657016236604922030276678535779711071037252141133353011745`, or even its slightly shorter hexadecimal equivalent `2a05ef2d86fc5deb47e74bc0290d5387c232b5411ad6f66a17cda37a803e6824ec68daab2e822a1b3169d920180239e75341981a0eb99e6063b35d762d994a21`, it would be very easy for you to make a mistake and enter `2a05ef2d86fc5deb47e74bc0290d5387c232b5411ad6f66a17cda37a803e6824ec68daab2e822a1b8169d920180239e75341981a0eb99e6063b35d762d994a21` instead. That seed will create a COMPLETELY different wallet ... one that has no access to your crypto assets. So, years ago, some smart people proposed encoding the seed as a series of words, each of which can be looked up in a standardized word list. The position, or index, of each word on the list represents a portion of the seed. It's a lot easier to see that you mis-transcribed `salmon rack coffee flash hello country nerve involve type chunk dizzy drastic` as `salmon rack coffee flash hello country nerds involve type chunk dizzy drastic`, especially since \"nerds\" isn't one of the words in the standard word list. \n\nSo a seed phrase, or mnemonic, is much easier and safer for humans to use as a backup for their wallet than a numeric seed. But do all wallets use the same word list for their mnemonics? Do they all use the same algorithm for deriving private keys and public keys from a seed? They didn't always, but these days almost everyone follows a set of standards codified in Bitcoin Improvement Protocols BIP-39, BIP-32 and BIP-44, among others. **If your hardware wallet gives you a BIP-39 mnemonic, you can recreate it in ANY other hardware or software wallet that uses BIP-39 mnemonics.** This is why it's essential to store the mnemonic safely and securely: if you lose the mnemonic seed and your device breaks, you lose everything. If someone else finds your mnemonic, you lose everything.",

The time to act was when the manufacturer ceased operation. Get a new device, send coins from old device to new device. By waiting for the old device to break, you lost the opportunity for the simplest remedy  \n\nContrary to the other comments, there's no guarantee that a seed phrase is portable from wallet to wallet. The HD key derivation algorithms vary from wallet to wallet, depending on the developer's preference. This is not a flaw. It allows for innovation  \n\nIf you get stuck with a seed phrase and no device to recover the wallet, there's a good chance that other hardware wallets have the same HD derivation paths, and there's a site which lists which ones might be compatible  \nhttps://walletsrecovery.org/  \n\nOtherwise, there's a software wallet (Electrum) with a wallet recovery function which tries the various derivation paths until it finds a wallet with transaction history. If your wallet is covered by the Electrum trial and error process, then Electrum does all the guesswork for you, automatically  \n\nFor the patient person, there's a BIP39 standalone tool. This does not search for transaction history. It gives you a list of addresses. It's probably a good idea to print your wallet's first 50 addresses now, so you can eyecheck the list against the BIP39 lists in a future year  \nhttps://iancoleman.io/bip39/  \n\nAlso, if you know it, write your wallet's derivation path on the same paper as your recovery mnemonic  \n\nToday, there are people struggling to recover old Multibit wallets. Recovery is always possible. But the instructions are not simple for your average part-time computer user  \n\nIn future years, people will be struggling to recover wallets using seed words, because they were told in 2022 that all wallets with seed words produce the same sets of keys and addresses  \n\nPrepare in advance. The simplest option is to be aware, and act sooner, not to be in a position where the manufacturer is gone and the device has failed  \n\nDon't assume the Electrum option and the BIP39 tool option will work, or will still be available years into the future. If they do work, they are great fallback options",

The government can ask for these records and a amount of btc according. \nWhen a company pays your salary a part of that goes to the government for taxes (at least here in Germany) why wouldn't it be like this with btc?\nThe key difference is that with btc the government can't print money and therefore tax the people in a more subtle way. \n\nI think it will take a long time until we use btc. Think about the internet: about 50 years ago the internet worked and how long is this really mainstream? \nBitcoin runs now about 13 years. My guess is that we have to wait about a generation for bitcoin to be adopted. We are so extremely early. All you can do is speak with people, what they think about the money printing, what they think about censorship (example: the USA has interfered (seized about 26.000$) in a transaction between a Dutch person and a German Bank)",

During this bull run i have started to see multiple posts of people exploring the blockchain and looking into the balance of some wallets to spot whales. I do understand that the blockchain is open for everyone to see and explore today, even if the wallet is not directly tied to any personal information of the person using it. I have taken a look at \"core wallets\" for desktop computers, the ones that should store the entire blockchain if I am not wrong (they need to sync every time they are opened). These wallets have a private key for when people need to send money to another wallet or to an exchange. This is the key people need to type each time they send money to another wallet or to an exhange. I have seen a lot of wallets that do not have a private key (alphanumerical string, very long) but a seed phrase. This phrase allows backup in case the wallet is lost. 1. Would my private key work the same way? Would it allow me to recover the wallet in case i uninstall the wallet \u2800or the compure on which it is stored is lost or broken? 2. Everytime someone needs to send funds they need to type their seed-phrase if you have a seed phrase instead of private key? When i have to recieve funds on my wallet i generate a new public address. This public address changes everytime. How are people looking on the blockchain which addresses have money into them if i generate a new public address everytime i recieve funds?",

                    "response": "Start by understanding why Bitcoin is special and unique. \n\nhttps://armantheparman.com/why-bitcoin-only/\n\nI appreciate your detail in replying. I want to start by stressing that it all comes down to scarcity. Without scarcity, cryptocurrency may as well be fiat. Good money is scarce. The biggest weakness of cryptocurrencies is that they can be created easily from nothing. All alts are like this. But Bitcoin is different. It has miraculously been born and has gained a huge lead in network effects. This can not be copied. Thus, it has gained scarcity. It is extremely decentralised, and has by far the greatest hashing power on the planet, and distribution of full nodes, which makes it not possible to tamper with the monetary policy. Bitcoin has scarcity due to network effect lead and \u201cun-tamper-ability\u201d.\n\nThe Lindy effect will only make it stronger as day after day it doesn\u2019t die. It can\u2019t be eradicated, just like a cancer that has spread too far.\n\nThe copies cannot compete with this. It needs the majority to not only leave Bitcoin, but mostly leave to the same choice. There are thousands of choices, so those few people that abandon Bitcoin will not all go to the same choice. In other words, defectors will disperse, not concentrate. The only way this could theoretically happen is if there is some fatal flaw with Bitcoin, AND it can\u2019t be fixed, AND an altcoin can, AND only one altcoin can.\n\nE.g. let\u2019s say Bitcoin\u2019s privacy weakness (really it\u2019s a trade off, not a weakness and any other coin with privacy just chooses a different trade off) is suddenly critical and everyone is exiting. Where will they go? Monero, Zcash, DASH, some to ETH and XRP (not private btw), Cardano\u2026. Can they all be money? Money printer go brrrr much?\n\nSo how else can an Altcoin take over? Remember that people will save in the best money. An Altcoin must become fundamentally better. In the open source world, how is that possible? It\u2019s like thinking it\u2019s possible for a better operating system to exist than the dominant open source one today (GNU Linux). The open source leader just gets better and better. All new ideas get absorbed.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine another currency finds a good use case. Let\u2019s say smart contracts. First that\u2019s like saying paper is money and valuable because contracts can be written on it. No, you need to make good money first, not find other uses for it. Aluminium has more uses than gold but it\u2019s less valuable because it is not money. It can\u2019t be money because it is not scarce. But even if smart contracts makes a cryptocurrency into good money, there are too many: ETH, Cardano, TRON, Iota, probably others.\n\nAs soon as any becomes valuable, it will invite competition and it will be copied. There is no scarcity. For goodness sake, ETH doesn\u2019t even work yet. Its Turing completeness is not even used. Bitcoin has smart contract capability and I understand nearly everything ETH is doing program-wise can be done with Bitcoin. Let\u2019s face it, it is competing with Bitcoin as a money and is far far behind and has no credibility. What will Vitalik Buterin do with the monetary policy next?\n\nETH is just another fiat with a central banker. That is not a true cryptocurrency. Remember why Bitcoin was born \u2013 we are fighting central banking and trying to separate money and state, not shoot ourselves in the foot by losing focus, trying to get rich by improving on the solution we already miraculously discovered. Bitcoin is that: a miracle \u2013 and we should embrace it.\n\nAlso, you mention ROI. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist so you can buy it and sell it for more fiat later. It is a REPLACEMENT for fiat. You buy and NEVER sell. You spend once it achieves its true value. You don\u2019t need an exit strategy. You just save in Bitcoin. With alts, you need to time your exit and sell to a greater fool, because alts are scams, holding forever will get you rekt. Just DCA Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s like picking up gold off the ground before anyone else realises it will become money. Don\u2019t pick up pebbles or seashells (alts), your pockets have limited space. Finally, the most important problem to solve is separating money and state. All other problems are tiny in comparison. We don\u2019t need to replace the legal system with smart contracts. We don\u2019t need a token for everything. We don\u2019t need to put bananas on a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is an invention that solves a humanitarian problem. Altcoins take a solution (blockchain) and try to find a problem. Remember that.",

I wonder if the person who pays me could send me Tether on crypto dot com, and then I can send that Tether to my bisq acct?  Advice?\n3. Is it a problem that I sent my encrypted backup file to samourai support in order to get my new wallet synced to their node / fix a zero-balance?  It fixed my issue, working at 'receiving' but I haven't tried to spend.  Already paying too much in txn fees not about to make extra txns.  I'm moving forward as though it's routine and once I have my own node I can reassess my security.\n4. I want to have my own lightning node, without overspending.  I have never used Linux but I guess I could learn some basics to operate the node.  One thing I'm thinking of is \"mynode\".  I'd be looking to hear about how to have the simplest working setup ad whether mynode is a good choice.\n5. Never used F-droid but I assume if I've already downloaded and installed samourai from Google Play the 'damage' is done and there's no point in downloading the other wallet, or what?  Can't trust or verify Google I guess, simple answer, but I live in reality, so, what's your opinion?\n6. If I did have a lightning node in the future, then how does it work?  My understanding is you just supply your liquidity to your \"channels\" which settle periodically?  Would it be a thing to open a payment channel with Bisq, do people do this, or is there a better way?\n7. Samourai Dojo?  So, what's up here?  You can use your own node in conjunction with your samourai wallet?  Or is this a feature that doesn't work?  Is there some cool hardware I can overspend on with a ninja logo?  Please educate me on how this all fits together, if you can be bothered. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould be good, I think.  Thank you!",

Bisq basically runs on bitcoin. You need bitcoin to make any kind of trade as some bitcoin is used as a security deposit.\n3. That sounds very sketchy. I would transfer all funds out of that wallet immediately.\n5. If you trust samurai wallet, then there is no difference (or at least very minimal) between the google play and fdroid versions.

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI have recently just got into trading crypto (day trading) and I have some questions about the concept because it just sounds too good to be true and I need some clarifications here.\n\nSo as long as you buy low and sell high, you are always on a profit. I don't intend to use leverage. I prioritize the risk management over more gain.\n\nSo, as far as I understand and I will use Bitcoin as an example:\n\nI invest 1000$ when the bitcoin is 36500 and I sell it when it is 38000 I will have a profit of around 40$ on this trade.\n\nLet's say I screw it up and I buy it at 36500 and the market drops and drops and I don't want to sell it in the same day. Instead of just having an auto stop when my profit is -200$ for example cause  I am afraid I will lose even more. Can't I just wait with that trade for a few days or weeks until it will go back up to at least be a bit on a profit?\n\nI just don't see how you can lose money if you only sell when it's higher than what you bought it for. Maybe you cannot sell it in the same day but you can sell it in the future when it will go up again.\n\nThe only way to lose money as far as I understand it's by buying when the cost it's really high and it'll never go above that or you just give up on the trade cause you are afraid it will never go up again.\n\nHow is my understanding so far?\n\nAppreciate your time!",

Are you thinking Bitcoin price will forever be between $30k and $60k.\n\nLook back late last year to when it was around $65k and ask yourself what you would have done during that time (both if you had an active trade, and also if you had no active trade).... and then ask yourself\n\n* what you then would have done if the price movement continued to $100k and never retraced back to $65k?\n* if you was waiting for a price low, what would that price low have been? Would you really have waited for Bitcoin price to drop 50% before opening a trade?\n\nYou'd need to be very honest in answering this question - because essentially, it's these points that relate to why people lose money when trying to swing-trade (non-leverage).",

But it only went as low as 9.8k and never went below that, and then he waited because he still believed we would see 9k and today he is completely priced out. Had he bought his full coin at 10k, would he today regret having paid 1k more than his initial plan?",

Bitcoin historically has had at least 2 bear markets lasting a little over 1 year thus you need to be prepared to not be forced to sell at a loss for at least 2 years to give yourself enough of a buffer.",

Whatever the case may be - it\u2019s certainly true that the _exchange_ could list the accounts you\u2019ve sent to, which would give some idea as to how much crypto you have. \n\nSomeone here might understand this better than I do, but I believe that even when you use different addresses to receive, they can be linked together when you send bitcoin from the wallet (via the joining of different UTXOs). \n\nI think one way to mitigate this is to use an intermediate wallet that receives from exchanges, and then have a cold storage wallet you only ever use to receive from the intermediary (and cycle receive address for both). This way even if someone can figure out approximately how much is in the active wallet, it will be hard to tell how much you have in total.",

Keep that BTC separate from the BYC you bought from Coinbase. \n\nThe issue is that Coinbase is a KYC exchange. KYC stands for \u201cknow your customer\u201d. Which means every sat you\u2019ve stacked from Coinbase is on record through the same regulatory measures that every dollar you store in a bank is on record. Even if you obfuscate ownership by doing coinjoins and moving to a hardware wallet, the amount that you own is on record. Unfortunately for you, that means that if the government ever tried to come after that money for tax purposes, you\u2019d have to prove your innocence. Yes, you read that correctly. When it comes to taxes, you are guilty until proven innocent even in America. \n\nSo move it off of Coinbase if you want to avoid it potentially being frozen, but moving forward it\u2019s best to purchase future funds P2P so the government has no records and there are no taxable events.",

You can use that to compare with the current heating system to see what the impact would be of having 1 or more miners.\n\nSome things to take into account though:\n\n- Bitcoin mining is only energy-efficient as a heating source when compared to resistive electric heating. Other forms of electric heating, most notably heat pumps, as well as gas heating are considerably more energy efficient, so if the facility uses such a heating method, the argument quickly falls apart.\n\n- Bitcoin miners are not designed to be used near people, so they're equipped with fans that are quite loud. If you use such devices, you need a way to get the heat to the people without getting the noise along for the ride.\n\n- Miners require a fairly large capital investment that takes time to earn back and you're dependent on the Bitcoin price for this. Even if all the power used comes at no extra cost (because it replaces power otherwise used for heating), it'll still take some time to earn back the initial investment. It requires some level of conviction that the Bitcoin price will remain at a reasonably high level and not many people making the decisions at companies have that.\n\n- You probably won't need (as much) heating in summer. Do you turn off the miners then? That'll cut into your return on investment. But the other alternative, getting rid of the heat in some way (by venting or just blasting AC against it) negates the energy efficiency argument.",

Everyone loses their shit when people educate them on this and call it money laundering or terrorist activity. This is bullshit.\n\nWhen you take cash out of your ATM, does everyone know what you spend that on? NO\n\nWhen you send BTC to someone, do you want them to know where you've spent your money or how much you have? NO It's basic privacy that is a human right.\n\nYou don't have to send everything to these wallets. Just keep the core balance on a Trezor or Ledger. Then when you want to spend some of it, run it through Coinjoin so that everyone can't see what your doing with your own money\n\nAlso, there are numerous sites and videos on Youtube that show you how to use these wallets. Educate yourself, (make sure to store your seed phrase on a steel plate and put them in a safe place), and do small transactions until you feel comfortable dealing with larger amounts. \n\nIt's a marathon, not a sprint\n\nCheers",

                    "response": "Here is another way to look at Proof of Work and its importance in efficient energy usage. So many people are focused on complicated political solutions of carbon taxes, credits , subsidies and the regulation and enforcement which will be both corrupt and inept and Bitcoin offers another simpler and more efficient approach.\nWith Bitcoin , Proof of work involves provably changing electricity into heat in an objective and provable manner . This has the following effects :\n\n1) The most important use case for energy is creating a fair, fungible , and secure open source money for humanity. This cannot be done with Proof of stake because proof of stake always trends towards centralization and is less secure.\n\n2) The waste heat from ASICs can be recycled and ASIC's are actually extremely efficient at converting electricity to heat. +99% efficient\n\n3) Almost all mining is being done with renewable energy right now. This doesn't need to be enforced by inefficient regulators but the economics of mining simply drive miners to naturally prefer renewable green energy to drive down costs\n\n4) Many sources of unused energy that would normally be wasted like underused hydrodams or waste gas can take advantage of mining bitcoin - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poj2UZ1mNbc  which is great for the environment\n\n5) Since Bitcoin competes with the same energy used in everything else than it naturally raises the cost of energy with everything else to reflect a more realistic cost of the behavior like running Christmas lights all December and the cost benefit of mining instead. This forces more efficient use of all energy usage in society as a consequence because now one must make the economic calculation if its wiser mine instead of do X and if the cost of electricity is really worth X , and how can we become more efficient to bring down the costs of electricity. A carbon token or credit is not needed because the natural tax of energy usage is built into the economy of competing with the security of a global money\n\n6) Since Bitcoin allows for more efficient markets due to being more fungible than less waste occurs due to market distortions from central planners and regulators which is really great for the environment\n\n7) When comparing the energy used in mining to traditional fiat you must analyze all the energy consumed in regulation, auditing, accounting, building infrastructure, security, ect to fairly compare the 2 \n\n----------------\n\nThere is a fallacy which rests on a false assumption that total amount electricity burnt must always correlate with the price of bitcoin. In reality the **cost** of electricity burnt will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin.\n\nThis means that as bitcoin continues to compete with all other forms of electrical demand worldwide the price per kW across the board will rise and thus decreasing the amount of electricity needed for bitcoin even if the price of bitcoin continues to rise and making bitcoin more and more efficient. This also has the side effect of encouraging more and more efficient and greener forms of cooling and electrical production.\n\nWatch this video -\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T0OUIW89II\n\n-------------------\n\nThere is an inescapable reality for any asset or currency that as it increases in value the production costs and costs to secure increase as well . This is demonstrated in the economic axiom: MC=MR\n\n\u201cRent\u201d always forces production costs (MC) to always equal sale prices (MR)\n\nPoS currencies and fiat are simply more abstract and complex forms or Proof of Work that use more human involvement (which uses tremendous amounts of resources and has a tremendous environmental impact) as a PoW coin like Bitcoin. Humans instead of ASICs are shouldering more of the work to create, regulate , and secure each of those currencies; This is \"work\" whether it involves burning electricity directly or food and electricity that humans consume  to perform their work. This is an inescapable economic reality. The more valuable something is the more it will cost to secure it because the more effort will be made to steal and or control it. This applies to any currency or asset.\n\nThis is also better understood with the dollar auction dilemma. In a hypothetical auction where a bidding war is fighting over the right to mint a 1 dollar bill how much do you think people will be willing to spend for this power ?\n\n\n\n-------------\n\nMore info\n\nhttps://www.danheld.com/blog/2019/1/5/pow-is-efficent\n\n\nhttps://medium.com/@hugonguyen/work-is-timeless-stake-is-not-554c4450ce18\n\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/the-last-word-on-bitcoins-energy-consumption\n\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/no-concentration-among-miners-isnt-going-to-break-bitcoin\n\n\nhttps://medium.com/the-bitcoin-times/proof-of-work-the-fundamental-laws-of-physics-and-nature-33d95167c57a\n\n\nhttps://medium.com/@nic__carter/its-the-settlement-assurances-stupid-5dcd1c3f4e41\n\n\nhttps://medium.com/@hugonguyen/proof-of-stake-the-wrong-engineering-mindset-15e641ab65a2\n\nhttps://medium.com/@hugonguyen/proof-of-stake-private-keys-attacks-and-unforgeable-costliness-the-unsung-hero-5caca70b01cb\n\n\nhttps://medium.com/@jimmysong/mining-centralization-scenarios-b74102adbd36",

What you would suggest is coinjoin in a wallet joinmarket instead. \n\nAlthough for most people this is not needed.\n\n> It does not take a forensic accountant to realize that Wallet B is associated with Wallet A.\n\nThis cannot occur if you send the complete balance from wallet A to a new address in wallet B . Additionally, outsiders cannot link individual UTXOs within either wallet or know how many wallets do or do not exist in my example. \n\nKeep in mind that those UTXOs will not be mixed in wallet B because the example I give is just for people concerned about long term privacy. When they are ready to spend those Bitcoin in wallet B they can just use coin control and load up each UTXO in its own lightning channel or any other private layer 2 solution. \n\n>Sending it from A to B every single time and calling that consumption is one of the easiest ways to get traced.\n\nTo an outsider there will be no link between UTXOs. To the exchange they will merely assume that the withdrawal address belongs to you in wallet A , and they won't know who controls wallet B or how many wallets exist that represent wallet B, and they wont know how many wallets you have for all the addresses in wallet A either.\n\n-----------------\n\nEdit - If you are curious to know how a person can make a mistake than the answer is the following:\n\nThey want to sell some of their Bitcoin for fiat from wallet B. So they lazily use a regular wallet without coin control and send the entire balance onchain back to the same exchange they bought the Bitcoin from combining all their UTXOs. The mistake here is 3 fold which ruins your privacy in different ways-\n\n1) Using the same exchange you bought the bitcoin from allowing them to use chain analysis to complete the loop \n\n2) Not using coin control to keep the UTXOs separate\n\n3) Using a regulated CEX to sell your btc for fiat instead of privately spending your bitcoin or privately selling your bitcoin(atm, dex, p2p)\n\nAll three aspects ruin your privacy in different manners",

So... in one sense if you have coins in a place that has errr 'oversight', and you've lied to them they can in theory 'freeze' your stuff as long as it's there. Once you send them to a wallet you control, they no longer have any access/control/input over your BTC at all whatsoever.... There will still be a record of it (forever), that you had x number of coins and moved them to this new wallet, and you could someday be on the hook for taxes if you sell the BTC at a profit but no one can take them from you or your wallet once they are moved.  \n\n\nThat said if you are moving them from say one exchange to another exchange... you are still letting the new exchange have some level of control over your coins. based on what you've described I'd say go ahead and move them, and don't worry too much about it.",

This allowed Bitcoin to grow in a natural and decentralized manner with proof of work and no premine. \n\nSome points of interest in what makes Bitcoin truly decentralized:\n\n1) No premine or instamine of coins. \n\n2) The whitepaper was published on October 31, 2008 and the first software was released on November 16, 2008 and Satoshi contacted many people that might be interested for months before mining the genesis block on January 3, 2009. \n\n3) Since there was over 3 days between the genesis block being mined and block 1 and difficulty was 1 it would be safer to assume satoshi waited for other miners to start mining before joining in . Satoshi included the message \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\u201d in the genesis block to timestamp the launch and prove no premining was done. Other miners like Hal Finney started mining as soon as Jan 10th, 2009 from his twitter post.\n\n4) The Genesis block that Satoshi mined is unspendable thus not giving an award to the creator \n\n5) Bitcoins market price was 0 till October 5, 2009 , thus miners sacrificed energy and resources for no reward initially just to support the network \n\n6) In the first 4 years many faucets existed to widely distribute Bitcoin to anyone that wanted to participate \n\n7) Bitcoin has the longest history in existence and the largest network effect of diverse users and developers of different backgrounds \n\n8) Bitcoin has already proven to be truly decentralized with a hostile takeover from a majority of miners, payment processors, and exchanges that tried to impose a hard fork (segwit2x being the last failed attempt that tried to increase the block limit to a max of ~7.4 MB ) in 2017 that didn't have sufficient consensus \n\n9) No company created and launched Bitcoin unlike many altcoins . \n\n10) Bitcoin is 100% open source with a diverse group of hundreds of developers contributing from many different backgrounds and many independent implementations of Bitcoin full nodes (core, knots,btcd,bcoin,libbitcoin, ....) More than any other altcoin and all with different means of coming to consensus. \n\n11) Satoshi walked away from Bitcoin early on making sure there is no cult leader people would follow\n\n12) Proof of work is the most important innovation in Bitcoin and the real reason why blocks , in a blockchain, exist. PoW is critical to maintaining decentralization as PoS is not only less secure but will always trend towards centralization because those with the most capital will have the most stake to collect the most fees in a vicious feedback loop where they grow in controlling the network. Bitcoin uses meritocracy of PoW insures bitcoin remains decentralized with a resource everyone has access to (electricity)\n\nSince mining BTC is so competitive, profit margins are typically thin and thus new entrants that either use a better tool to mine (ASIC) or find cheaper sources of power(typically green due to the economics) can quickly gain market share making lasting monopolies difficult. Even if a main ASIC manufacturer appears to have a large market share we can see this quickly change due to a single malinvestment or a mistake when developing the newest ASIC. Power is a resource that comes from many sources and allows many locations around the world to remain competitive for unique reasons.\n\n\n13) Bitcoin has the most hashrate security\n\n14) Bitcoin is the most stable non pegged cryptocurrency with the most liquidity\n\n15) Bitcoin has the most development and best roadmap",

Coins from one account will never mingle with coins from another account unless the user explicitly mingles them.  This is the point of accounts... \"isolation\"\n3. Not necessarily.  So long as you freeze the tainted coins you might still get away with it.  But if the Umbrella node or your electrum node are using IPv4 instead of Onion or I2P, then the damage may already be done.  You need to evaluate your exposure.\n4. If you run a node, and never broadcast your own transactions, then there is no way to tell your wallet addresses from any peer or SSL cracking.  If you use Electrum or some other non-full-node wallet, it should be trivial to understand how your addresses are leaked in balance queries and TXN broadcasts\n5. Labeling feature is fine, but that is a feature in the Trezor wallet which is NOT as private as Umbrel.  Trezor backend servers will get XPUBs from your wallet to do balance queries.  Any \"agent\" working at Trezor could unmask you.\n6. Pretty much, yes.\n\nKeep in mind... Unless you are the BTC fund organizer for an illegal Canadian protest, you likely don't need to worry about any of this stuff.  The odds of an \"agent\" working undercover at the Trezor datacenter with the sole purpose of unmasking u/Complex_Carb are a few giant leaps beyond clinical paranoia.\n\nI assume you are really asking what is \"possible\" not what is \"probable\".\n\nPS: I don't know Umbrel at all.

Generally miners send hashes to mining pools. The pools must run full nodes and they therefore verify the transactions. A solo miner, i.e. a miner that does not mine to a pool, must run a full node as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And if they verify it blindly and send the resulting hash to the full node, will the full node reject the whole block (including all the other transactions in the same block)?

This doesn't happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What is to avoid people spamming the blockchain with these fail transactions that will never pass and therefore tie up the transaction queue?\n\nIf a full node receives an invalid transaction, it does not keep it in the transaction queue, known as the mempool. If a full node receives too many invalid transactions from an IP address, it blocks that IP address so as to stop the spam.",

Technically, this is fairly simple  \n\nThe management processes are not simple  \n\nThe key holders (signers) need to be selected for their honesty, reliability and competence. Key holder is a financial trust role, not an IT role. The chosen signers need sufficient technical training to learn how to store their keys without losing them and to store them without revealing them, especially not to the IT support staff  \n\nBitcoin allows up to 15 signers - the maximum value of m is 15. The company's processes need to decide the correct number for n. If too few signatures are required, the key holders could conspire to embezzle the coins. If too many signatures are required, it could be difficult to coordinate them when their signatures are required for spending some coins. Five-of-fifteen might be reasonable  \n\nThe set of signers would change whenever one signer leaves the company or loses the company's trust. When this happens a new n-of-m multisignature wallet replaces the old one, and all the coins should be sent from old wallet to new wallet  \n\nIf a company outsources custody to a service provider, the company is trusting the service provider to perform all the above key management. This would be risky - trusting key holders who have no loyalty to the company which owns the coins  \n\nMicrostrategy would definitely not trust Michael Saylor to be the sole key holder, and probably would not choose him to be one of the 15 multisignature key holders",

After buying from an exchange withdraw the Bitcoin to a private wallet like one of these \n\nhttps://walletscrutiny.com\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aZ1zbaUEzCo9NCctN8-eL2VLIiSdY009tTJvRXDUWEw/edit#gid=0\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/g42ijd/faq_for_beginners/\n\nBetter yet do this -\n\n1) Buy bitcoin (even from a regulated exchange with fees of 0.1% to 0.5%)\n\n2) Withdraw it to temporary wallet A (Example- mobile open source hot wallet)\n\n3) Within 1-4 hours of receiving it in wallet A send to wallet B(example - your hardware wallet) and never send transactions backwards from wallet B to wallet A. Send entire amount every time you do this to insure that the exchange cannot associate your Unique withdrawal addresses with each transaction.\n\nNote- you can technically use a single wallet and use \"coin control \" feature to manually separate out your UTXOs but the above is an idiot proof method to avoid mistakes\n\nWhy?\n\nYou can easily spend Bitcoin privately in many ways , including just using a lightning wallet today . Since you are just concerned about long term privacy you are better off simply creating evidence immediately for plausible deniability that the address you withdrew to (assumed by exchanges and regulators to likely be yours) no longer has the bitcoin and those bitcoin could have been spent , lost, sold , used within a small window of time where no or an insignificant amount of capital gains would have occurred.",

I know there will be a password to fully restore it once I get to that point and I know the password. I'm having trouble getting anywhere trying to restore it. The layout of the wallet is like:\n\n13+5/57\n\n14/19/3/21/5\n\n5/28/12++11/15\n\n/6=\n\nEach number is actually a string of numbers and letters, just obviously didnt want to share it in its entirety. I've tried restoring the wallet through Electrum and even took multiple days to install the \"bitcoin core\" blockchain, with no success. Electrum said \"cannot read wallet file. (parsing failed)\" and bitcoin core says \"data is not in recognized format\". The actual file is just a \"file\" in the properties but I can easily convert it do a .dat file. Any help to try and restore the wallet, or find out the amount in it would be greatly appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:: Thanks for the help everyone, especially  u/llrik11. Got to the stage where I can type in the password, unfortunatly password I had was wrong but I know the main part of the password, so it'll come eventually!",

Persist with the instructions /u/llrik11 is helping you with  \n\nAs a tag at the start of a ciphertext (encrypted) file, \"Salted__\" informs the decryption function that the key stretching function (password based key derivation - PBKDF2) uses a \"salt\" as well as the passphrase to derive the encryption key from the passphrase  \n\nSymmetric encryption (mostly using the AES cipher these days) uses a key which is the same size as the size of each encryption block - 128 bits for AES128, 256 bits for AES256. Humans don't memorize 128-bit keys. They use passphrases. Internally, cryptography software like OpenSSL hashes the passphrase to create the key  \n\nBut hashing creates a cryptographic weakness. Crackers can and do create rainbow tables - huge tables pairing passwords and keys - to reduce brute force effort. Salting has been used for many decades to defeat the use of rainbow tables, wherever passwords are hashed, either for authentication or for key-stretching in symmetric encryption",

Well, the taxes part is, technically, but only if you sell the bitcoin for cash or cash equivalent. \n\nAnyone can setup a \"node.\" A node is a part of the network that assists with transactions, & is a core part of the infrastructure. You end up downloading all or a recent part of the blockchain, & your node helps verify transactions. Note: this is NOT the same thing as mining. \n\nThis node then becomes your wallet, as well. \n\nThen, you can acquire crypto a few different ways without purchasing via Paypal and such. It could be as simple as giving cash to a friend who is willing to buy via a centralized exchange. It could be as involved as setting up your own mining rig. Either way, you can get coin that is anonymous. \n\nHowever, anonymity & privacy aren't necessarily the point. They CAN be, and there a projects dedicated to that. But, the point at a larger scale, is a more democratic monetary system. In the case of most cryptocurrency right now, that resulted in non-private blockchains. But there's no philosophical reason that has to be the case, it was just the simplest secure way for the first iterations. \n\nFinally, it's important to understand WHY cryptocurrency is more democratic. Open source code is at the core of it. Anyone can look at the code, & draw conclusions from it. That doesn't mean everyone has to or should, but they can. But this means the currency is FAIR. There's no central bank printing money for someone else while you & I are left in the lurch. With crypto, you, the big guys, & I, all play by the same rules. \n\nTaxes? Death & taxes & all that. They only tax when you sell. So buy, hodl, spend. No selling.",

Then send to a self custody wallet, preferably cold storage, but a mobile wallet like electrum or muun works until you can get together some  type of cold storage. If you're still waiting for ID verification, I would take the time to understand self custody rather then storing on the exchange. Understand what it means to control your wallet keys and how cold storage works.",

(0.5 BTC + fee)\n\n- Use the Bitcoins on address X (= 1 BTC)\n\n- Make an output/Transaction to address A with 0.5 BTC. \n\n- Insert the transaction fee for the miners \n\n- Because 1 BTC is too high, create a refund to an address controlled by the wallet. Refund = 1 BTC - 0.5 BTC- Transaction fee. \n\nOr you wish to pay 4 BTC:\n\nYour wallet:\n\n- Use the 2 BTC on address Y\n\n- Use the 3 BTC on address Z\n\n- Insert a transaction fee\n\n- Refund to an address controlled by the wallet with the value of: (3 + 2) - 4 - Transaction fee.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nEdit: Because I try to explain it in easy terms, I understand that some details are not correct.",

This might sound like I'm joking, but I'm not, I'm honestly curious.  So something like zombie apocalypse, or global pandemic where like 80% of people die, solar storm, mega volcano and nuclear winter, etc.  Would bitcoin be able to survive and thrive in such a scenario?  would the internet still work?

Local Bitcoins is where you transfer locally in PKR, but you dont know who you are dealing with - could be a scam.

I will always be motivated to keep it in my pocket and see its value rise.\n\n2) Traceability problem and criminality use: still to today from what I see the best use of an anonymous de-centralized currency system like bitcoin (yes, you have your public key, but technically no one can know your private key and go really back to your real identity) is to use it in order to transfer money linked to illegal activity easily from one part to the other of the world or to use it for money laundry practice (I see no better and easier way to stock some illegally obtained cash).\n\nThis is actually a concern I have on ALL cryptocurrency schemes in general\n\n3) Energy intensive problem: It is already demonstrated that in general BITCOIN due to the proof of work coding system has a crazy high environmental cost. \n\nTo quote the most discussed study on the matter and quantify the problem:\n\n\"The report states that each Bitcoin transaction consumes 1,173 kilowatt hours of electricity. That's the volume of energy that could \"power the typical American home for six weeks,\" the authors add. The Bitcoin mining that enables a purchase, sale or transfer, it posits, uses a slug of electricity that costs $176.\"\n\nI attach also a useful screenshot that makes me think.\n\nLet me know what you think of these 3 long term concerns for me that make me see a HUGE opportunity in crypto and even more in blockchain, but make me very skeptic about BITCOIN be really a long term asset and potential substitute of traditional currencies.",

It is a negligible %age of global energy use, similar to the energy use of online streaming services, and serval times less that of gold mining, and less than the power used by devices on standby in the US alone. It is also one of the most renewable industries already, and will be a useful component in subsidising green energy generation technologies. It is not a major contributor of global warming emissions, it's not even close.\n\n...And then what critics will do 9 times out of 10 when this is pointed out, is pivot instead to '*Well, it's still a \\*waste\\* of energy*\" - essentially showing their actual colours they they think bitcoin shouldn't exist and needs to justify itself to them. \n\nThankfully, nobody has unilateral authority to assign what consitutes a 'waste' of energy. A mechanism to move any amount of value across any geopolitical boundary almost instantly with no counterparty risk or authority oversight on the most most secure network with the hardest asset on earth is evidently useful in the eyes of the global free market.",

Privacy serves utility to more than just criminals. It\u2019s a critical piece of ensuring Bitcoin retains its censorship resistant properties. Also, it\u2019s more traceable than you might think. Technologies like CoinJoin transactions, HD wallets, and Lightning Network are making it more difficult to trace - but that\u2019s a good thing to the world and a bad thing for authoritarians. If you\u2019re concerned about traceability, just look up some of the recent major investigations. You\u2019ll quickly see that the transparency of the blockchain actually aids regulators and investigators in this regard in many ways, much better than what fiat transactions offer.\n\n3. Check out these Twitter resources. Bitcoins energy use is also a highly complex topic. But to start, if you can\u2019t see the value of a trustless, global, interdiction resistant, privacy preserving, deflationary monetary system then you will likely see any energy use as a waste. Almost all improvements to civilization have required energy (look at washing machines, cars). Bitcoin is no different. It\u2019s up to the people to determine if that energy use is worthwhile. https://mobile.twitter.com/mtcbtc/status/1346813481257984001\n\nEdit - I\u2019d also encourage you to research the Lightning Network. It addresses some of your concerns. Also the energy use per transaction statistic is highly misleading. Many transactions can be bundled into one, there are second layer solutions like lightning network that only do final settlement of many transactions on the base layer blockchain, etc. Looking at energy use on a per transaction basis just isn\u2019t a representative metric of what is driving the energy consumption",

With points 2 or 3, anybody's nan who decided to do a 5-10 minutes objectives research would have found the rebuttals to these critiques by now. Whether you agree that those rebuttals are valid is another matter. but there's simply no excuse to present your post as if these critiques have remained unchallenged. And so I won't use up my time addressing #2 and #3.\n\nSo with Point #1...\n\nwell someone's already mentioned how BTC may be seen as a store of value, but let's instead adopt your hypothesis of BTC becoming the *sole* global currency.\n\nPersonally I don't think people are not going to cease purchasing goods.... because they will always have a need for goods. To imply they would starve themselves to death is unrealistic, and to imply they will make themselves homeless by waiting for the bottom of a \"bottomless housing bear market\" is also unrealistic.\n\nSo as long as there is market demand for something, there is always profit in businesses creating goods and services. Furthermore, decreasing prices will probably pressurise businesses into increasing their product quality in order to be competitive.\n\nYeah perhaps sometimes we need to step out of the economy books for a second or two.",

Bitcoin is better thought of as a store of wealth like gold or property, rather than a currency. l know, it's called BitCOIN and labeled as a crypto currency, but it's really not meant to be used as a day to day currency for buying coffees and such. Yes, you CAN use it to make payments like this at certain places, but as you know most people don't want to spend it given its deflationary and volatile nature. It's better used as collateral which you then borrow against to make payments. In the US, bitcoin is classed as property and taxed as such, not as a currency (different countries have different laws on this I think).\n\n2. Block chain technology literally makes crypto currencies the hardest to wash and make use of after a hack, due to the ledger being freely viewable by all. Hacked and stolen coins are tagged as such and just sit in wallets. They aren't accepted by regulated exchanges and if they ever move, you know they are being tracked by authorities. If you want to steal money, steal fiat currencies. \n\n3. Crypto mining isn't polluting the world and causing climate change.

And yesterday the dip began I panicked and withdrew the whole thing because I assumed that if the dip continued and since I only have a small decimal btc that I would lose that investment. But then I keep reading about HODL. So my question is\n\nLets say the dip continues and I HODL. Since I only bought 300 usd of btc and the dip continued to decrease that 300 usd of btc, would it turn to zero value? And I end up with nothing? Or I still have that 0.006btc? \n\nUgh sorry if it doesnt make sense\ud83d\ude05\u270c\ud83c\udffd",

This is what people mean when they say hodl. \n\nNow the value of that 0.006 btc will fluctuated. If the price goes down, then it is worth less. If the price goes up, then it is worth more.\n\nIf the the price of bitcoin decreases enough then the value of your 0.006 could be $0, ie worthless. The question is: do you think that is going to happen?\n\nPeople who advocate hodling believe the price is going to go up in the long term. They do not care about short term price fluctuations.\n\nSince you are new, I would recommend avoiding trading based on the current price and short term fluctuations. This is day trading and without experience and knowledge it is no better than literal gambling.",

I know you are using rough estimates and that Bitcoin didn't actually hit $50,000, but for my explanation that doesn't matter.\n\nYou now own 0.006 Bitcoins. Whatever the value of Bitcoin is, you own 0.006 times the value of that. So if Bitcoin drops to $25,000, you still own 0.006 of a Bitcoin. $25,000 times 0.006 = $150. If it drops all the way to $100, you still own that 0.006. So the value of it it now 60\u00a2. The only way your portion of a Bitcoin drops to zero is if the value of Bitcoin also drops to zero.\n\nBut there is a bigger issue you need to think about. It sounds like you made a rookie mistake and you panic sold. And that's okay. You're a rookie. And you can and should learn from this. The point of HODL is the belief that the value of Bitcoin is going to generally increase over time. It can be really freaky at first because in short time frame, the value of Bitcoin is all over the place. But so far, on longer timelines it's gone up. The people who bought in at the end of 2017 when it hit $19,500 were down for 3 years. At one point they were down 80%. But the ones that held and didn't panic sell now have over twice the value of the investment during what we are calling a dip. And the ones that panic sold missed out.\n\nThe point to all of this is, if you try and time the market you're going to lose. Your best return is to buy and hold it for years. Every single time I've bought Bitcoin, it lost value before it gained value. And sometimes it happened over and over again. But eventually, except for some of my most recent dollar cost average buys, it has all gone up and up and up in value. And I am confident that the Bitcoin I bought when it was over $60,000 and is currently down over 25% will eventually be profitable. It may or may not happen this year. Or the next year. Or the year after that. But it'll get there.",

Noped out of that, sold the BTC for fiat and transfered to my bank for minimal fees (zero? + cost of selling was the mining fee of about 75 cents I think).  They also had a $10 minimum for selling/moving the BTC.  Frustrating experience having to abide by their arbitrary and user unfriendly rules, this was a test run for using them and their services.  Obviously binance is not right for me.  Point is you HAVE to DYOR.  Exchanges are for profit businesses and some of them are EXPENSIVE and have dumb rules while offering little to no protection for your transactions or your crypto while it is on their exchange.  Try to find multiple ways to buy, sell and move your digital currencies so you are not trapped into paying high fees.  Don\u2019t leave YOUR crypto on any exchange.  I think many of the exchanges just copy the playbook from old school banking & credit card companies\u2026 they only care about the money not the customer and their rules are meant to serve them not you.

Even if one is convinced, the evidence only supports the claim that the **dominant miner may have generated significantly less than a million bitcoin in our view. Perhaps 600,000 to 700,000 bitcoin** is a better estimate.\n\n>**None of the above says much about whether the dominant miner was Satoshi**, although we know Satoshi mined block 9, which we have allocated to the dominant miner in our analysis. **However this is in a slope of just 11 blocks, so it\u2019s certainly not conclusive**. Whoever the dominant miner was, it is of course **possible the keys have been lost or discarded by now**.\n\nThus block 9 and genesis block was created by Satoshi 100%, and the evidence reflects he might have mined 11 blocks at least in addition to the genesis under these assumptions .\n\nThis means the evidence suggests we definitely know satoshi mined 2 blocks , and likely mined 11 blocks, and that **perhaps** there was a dominant miner who mined between 600-700k bitcoin(not blocks). **There are other explanations for the extranonce pattern that do not point to a dominant miner. Simply a similar software setup can cause this.**\n\nSince there was over 3 days between the genesis block being mined and block 1 and difficulty was 1 it would be safer to assume satoshi waited for other miners to start mining before joining in .\n\nHere are examples of at least 2 early miners mining alongside satoshi from the start \n\nhttps://stephanlivera.com/episode/314/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/halfin/status/1110302988",

What's also not known is whether the keys to these early coins are still accessible. Many suspect that most of the early Bitcoin has been lost, but there's no way to confirm that.\n\nNote that Satoshi did not \"pre-mine\" Bitcoin. The first block, the Genesis block, was mined on or after 3 January 2009. We know this because this block contains a newspaper headline from that date, meaning that this block couldn't have been mined before this newspaper came out. Note that the 50 BTC from the Genesis block are not spendable. \n\nAfter the Genesis block, there were no blocks mined for 6 days. On the 9th of January, the Bitcoin source code was first released on SourceForge and Satoshi announced this on a cryptography mailing list. 14 blocks were mined that day in a period of a few hours. Then it stopped and started again a full day later. Mining started to become more or less continuous not long after.\n\nSatoshi released the Bitcoin whitepaper several months before the first block was mined and the software was released, so interested parties had time to study the concept. So all these facts combined are clear evidence that Satoshi didn't pre-mine. Bitcoin was pre-announced well ahead of the launch and the mining spendable coins didn't start until the software had been released.\n\nIt's certainly possible, and even likely, that in the early days very few people mined and that Satoshi was able to mine many Bitcoins. But that would have been because not many people were interested, not because Satoshi pre-mined.",

Of course I do not convert it to real cash until I get these crypto coins transfered into my digital wallet (Binance) and only after this I will declare to IRS about making cryptos on Binance.

Thus almost doubling in price as the market was pricing in the expected scarcity. Thereafter a very gradual increase to 11k over 5 months before the bull market went parabolic to over 60k usd. This halvening created a double bull market in the same year akin to the 2013 bill market.  \n\n\nThus you can see no previous bull and bear market is exactly the same so timing buying and selling is tricky.\n\nWhat you can see is that whenever Bitcoin goes parabolic there will be a large correction due but knowing when is hard to predict\n\nThe next halving will occur near may 4 2024\n\nhttps://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/",

The benefit here is that you can have 3-5 controllers, but they are useless unless you plug the physical cold storage key into them to make them work. \n\nSo if a devices does end up getting hacked, the key is actually in your cold storage and the information won't be found anywhere inside those devices. \n\nA good cold storage key, like a ledger nano, also only allows data to go in 1 direction, meaning that if a hacker hacks your device while the key is plugged in, they would not be able to dig into your cold storage and read the key information. \n\nI put together this post about private key security education - https://www.reddit.com/r/OsmosisLab/comments/sk7c3f/security_education - and it is a deep dive into the physics behind crypto wallets. I hope this helps and that you never have to experience a compromised wallet. \n\nThe best advice I can give you is that there is no crypto support that will send you a private message. And no crypto support will ever ask you for your seed phrase. Whoever you give your seed phrase to now has ownership over your wallet. Please avoid giving out your seed phrase at all cost.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

So onto the topic-\n\nI opened electrum today and discovered that the entire contents of my wallet, around 0.016 BTC are gone - the txid is  `84078e36ae2a8c955f53aca3aee0c4746db4894aa3bedba2aaa4882956af63d0`, transferred to an unknown wallet address  [`1C48z7Bh17An5y8r3ewT1rG9y8TojiA79a`](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1C48z7Bh17An5y8r3ewT1rG9y8TojiA79a). I haven't fallen for a phishing mail, didn't scan a QR code, and didn't open electrum either that day - the only plausible explanation is that my PC was somehow compromised (strangely I couldn't recall downloading anything fishy either), and that my recovery phrase had been leaked. \n\nEither way, I entered the culprit address into [glasschain.org](https://glasschain.org) and found out that this address apparently belongs to the wallet `W-4289187953`, which doesn't contain any other addresses. \n\nA quick look through this wallet's exchange history has led me to discover that it has mainly distributed funds to two different wallets - `W-0098820189` and `W-0085363382`, with the latter being marked as an OKex exchange wallet. The latest two withdrwals that the culprit made, both on Apr 12th, are both being sent to this exchange address - which basically means (if my logic is correct here) that this exchange address is associated with the culprit, and is likely (one of) the source where the culprit sells their stolen coins.\n\nNow, what can I do with this information? I know that exchanges require an ID verification and are at least linked with the authorities; the problem is how should I contact them to let them know (and most importantly, convince) that this is indeed the culprit that was responsible for my stolen funds?\n\nContacting ***my*** local authorities is sadly not an option since crypto is apparently outlawed in my country. What a shame. Is there anything else I can do?",

The CEO of that site just stepped down\n\n6) many  banks have stopped transfers to them in the UK and other countries due to fraud investigations\n\n7) They are fighting multiple class action lawsuits due to their fraud and illegal securities\nSome examples -\nhttps://www.rosenlegal.com/cases-1839.html\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/455203877/Lee-et-al-vs-Binance\n\n8) They are mostly dependent into the tether ponzi scheme that will likely implode in the future. Binance, other than tether, holds the biggest USDT reserves thus making it the primary exchange effected when this Ponzi implodes and stopping most of its incoming liquidity. Tether and other stable coins will be increasingly targeted by regulators due to concerns of money laundering and capital flight.\n\n9)\tThey are mostly used to trade shitcoins but with supporting so many sketchy projects that increases ones attack surface from a technical layer because any bug or exploit can lead to loss of funds\n\n10) Binance \u201csmart chain\u201d is run exclusively on their own personal servers thus when the company goes defunct or arrests are made these may stop functioning and all tokens and wallets they control (trust) will have problems \n\n\n\n11) Binance is known to use their leverage tokens and trade against their clients and manipulate the market for their personal gain \n\n\n12) Binance operates without a proper license in multiple countries, more and more news is coming out about regulators in those countries specifically saying that Binance is operating illegally. This means it's easy for governments can make Binance Insolvent placing my funds at risk. Binance is not officially registered in any country and does not pay taxes making them a target for regulators.\n\n\n https://twitter.com/franciskim_co/status/1423658703174082567\nFurther reading on new risks and regulatory concerns -\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/p12oz0/best_way_to_dca/h8anlfq/\n\n13) They openly lie about their wallet being open source - https://trustwallet.com/developer/ when it is not open source\n\nhttps://walletscrutiny.com/android/com.wallet.crypto.trustapp/\n\nhttps://walletscrutiny.com/iphone/com.sixdays.trust/\n\nas you cannot test and build the binaries from source. The lie is built upon the ignorance of many that are unaware that almost all software you use is dependent upon some open source repositories/libraries/dependencies but unless we can peer review 100% of the source code and build the binaries from the source we cannot verify if any intentional or unintentional exploits or backdoors exist in the software.\n\nThis means that at best you have a wallet that is slightly better than using a custodian because you have access to the private keys that you could restore your coins in a separate wallet if their full nodes that support this light client is offline but there might be privacy leaks or exploits and backdoors that allow them or outsiders to steal your coins.\n\nWhat is the point in using cryptocurrency if you ultimately need to have faith in a single company or developer ? This undermines many of the security assumptions of cryptocurrencies.\n\n14) Incompetence by leaving 1 billion dollars worth of unconfirmed transactions for more than a year causing huge loses and frozen accounts\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/12/binance-freezes-doge-withdrawals-as-users-report-being-asked-to-return-coins-they-dont-have/\n\nhttps://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/7602e2790f3c444d8d6ed47d6954bcef",
