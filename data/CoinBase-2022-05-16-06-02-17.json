When i am trying to raise a support request, I am not able to find the exact TXN has. I am following the steps mentioned in \"[https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/crypto-education/where-is-my-wallet-address](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/crypto-education/where-is-my-wallet-address)\" but when i search the ETH Block Explorer with WLUNA CB Address it says \"NO MATCHING REQUEST\". As a result i am unable to provide a valid data against mandatory \" **Transaction hash\" column while raising a support request.  I am worried as to why no TXN has been generated.**\n\nPlease let me know how to raise a support request in this case? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegards,\n\nRay",
