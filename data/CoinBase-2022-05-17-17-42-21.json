Both of them were very sweet, but they just couldn't help me.\n\nThe first told me (after 10 minutes) that she couldn't help me because I'm in Canada. I have to call the number for support in Canada. Which doesn't exist, which is why I called the USA/international phone number. So then she tells me that I have to contact them by email. Which I already did twice, only to get an auto-reply saying that they closed the ticket without resolving anything and thanking me for contacting them.\n\nSo I called again at the same number, spoke to another agent. After 10 minutes, she also told me that she couldn't help me. The team that could help me are not reachable by phone, only by email. So she transferred them a new ticket number.\n\nI'm desperate.

In this email the agent assigned to your case also gave you a couple of steps to follow, to make sure that your account is within compliance during this review.
