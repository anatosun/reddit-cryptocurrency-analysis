Coinbase has no control over the duration of or end date for the lockup period, which will ultimately be determined by the success of the update to the Ethereum network.\n\nUnlike other staking services provided through Coinbase, you will be unable to opt out of ETH staking once you\u2019ve staked your ETH. Coinbase will not refund or replace any ETH you wish to unstake. You will not be able to trade, transfer or otherwise access your staked ETH or ETH staking rewards during the lockup period. For more information please refer to the user agreement here:\nhttps://www.coinbase.com/legal/user_agreement/united_states\n\nLet us know if you need anything else.",
