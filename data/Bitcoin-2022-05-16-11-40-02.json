If you understand how money works in the current system and how to generate cash flow that exceeds your needs you will have surplus money to invest. If you understand that Bitcoin is the best investment in generations, but does not yield cash flow, you will invest well. If you understand the influence technology will have on the future, you will be prepared to spot other opportunities. Good luck! Wish I had started this journey at 21.",

The amount you're putting in does not really matter, as long as it's something that suits your risk tolerance and as long as you follow a clear game plan. DCA is not exactly the most efficient way of investing, but it has the advantage of being very simple and quite safe.\n\nOne easy way to optimize it is to keep an eye on the price and put your money on the side regularly instead of buying Bitcoin directly with it every week. Then, maybe once a month or so, when the price gets lower than usual, you buy more Bitcoin at once. It's pretty much DCA with an extra step, but it will net you a lower average over the long term.",

That is what Coinbase calls whitelisting. It prevents someone from moving your BTC or crypto out of your account because they can only send it to whatever wallet(s) you've registered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can turn it on without registering wallets. That just means your assets will remain in your Coinbase account until you either turn off Allow Lists  or register a wallet at a later date. You can turn it off or register at any time, but there will be a 48 hour waiting period because Coinbase will notify you and give you a chance to secure your account if necessary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: of course you're going to be told to get a hardware/cold wallet in this subreddit. But if you aren't ready for that, please at least consider turning on 2 factor authentication (using Google Authenticator or Authy if possible) and allow lists.",

There's alot to learn, from the limits of FCA/FDIC insurance for your bank account, to the different factors for inflation (money printing is not the only one, but it isn't negligible as economists would like you to think -- also economics is far from scientific even though they pretend it is.)\n\nBudgeting will prove very invaluable as you gain convictions and start to understand that allocating money towards savings is not optional and as you learn what is saving, what is investing and what is holding fiat.\n\nI always keep some fiat to hand, but I use budgeting to optimise my savings allocations. I don't just save in Bitcoin, but I don't save in any other digital currencies either (altcoins=shitcoins, there's a lot of reading material as to why but it requires understanding why bitcoin isn't a shitcoin which takes time)\n\nDon't let buying bitcoin stop you from living, going on holiday, buying a property, starting a business etc.\n\nHave fun and learn to think long term now that you finally have a savings account \ud83d\ude01",

The idea of doing $10 a week is great.  That way you're buying $40 a month, and your fee will be the same .99 cents per purchase.  This means you're paying about 2.4% as a fee to buy which is inline with lots of fees you might pay in life.  That's less than credit card companies choose, so that is pretty decent to me.  The way you were doing it it was 40%.  When was the last time you paid that sort of fee?  Can you imagine if you walked into McDonalds and got a meal that says it is $6.99 and it cost you $9.75?  That's nuts.  I would stick to the monthly buys too, if you buy $10 a week it's going to be $4, which is 10% fee instead of 2.5%, I get that with the price going up you don't want to miss out, but I think buying month makes a lot more sense.  When I look at my fees each year when it's time to do my taxes it's staggering how much I spend.  It can be as much as $50 on any individual coin, so if I bought 5 coins that's $250 I'm never getting back.",
