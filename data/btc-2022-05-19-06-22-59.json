If you have a look at the [txns/day](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin%20cash-transactions.html#3y) for BCH over the passed couple years, you'll see that the txns (spam, imo) led the pump & dump of its price (where I & other BCH buyers lost a fortune, last May). This is strong evidence that speculators speculate based on measured **TPS** (Txns/Sec) or possibly fees paid. So in 2017 the speculators supported whichever version of Bitcoin had the most spam, or the most **spam revenue** (fees paid to miners). They might just base their speculation on on-chain metrics, which are based on spam. Imagine gmail was charging a fee per email sent to gmail, then the company split, and the speculators honestly drove up the stock price of the version with the most spam revenue. Tbh, I think this makes CSW look less evil, because he knows full well that only spam really works (it's healthy, or something). If Satoshi needs His coin to be a **S**tore-**O**f-**V**alue, so businesses can use it, then He needs to maintain a high level of spam to keep investors/holders happy with on-chain proof of its utility. I don't have much against tether, since it's useful & could pump either coin.",

The TPS gradually increased from the start of 2021, peaked mid-Feb, then dropped at the end of April. The price dump occurred mid-May. Though it coincided with a broader correction, it still looks like a pump n dump, and BCH never came back the way BTC or ETH did.\n\nThe 4 TPS looks similar to BSV's 3.1 TPS, [currently](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-sv). Maybe it was CSW himself who profited immensely from all the fools like myself who bought BCH near the peak. He just has to spam the chain and take a long position (maybe with leverage), before exit scamming (late Apr to mid-May). Noise.cash may have had almost nothing to do with it, imo. The sum total of [memo.cash](https://memo.cash) and everything us humans could possibly do, is nowhere near the consistent **4 TPS** which caused the massive price speculation.",

They can just as well pump any other coin, with more success, depending on the situation.\n\nTechnically if it was all really noise.cash, then that's not a scam. The problem is I'd have say it was spam from a little Python script or something, which misled a lot of investors into thinking BCH really had **4 TPS**. It's a bit like a CEO telling investors that there are 4 customers per second, when it's really 0.6 or 0.7. That's why spam is so deadly. Increasing Bitcoin's block-size guarantees more spam, and only 2x probably might not reduce fees much (spammers don't want ppl to pay more than say a dollar, so they can just spam twice as much). This whole industry looks like spam, imo. If the whole industry is spam, then clearly noise.cash was just another excuse to scam speculators (but that wasn't guaranteed to happen, by design, it's a *coincidence*).",

So BCH shows a little pump but nothing threatening to the narrative, and then the slow grind continues.\n\nMaybe the shorting machine was expensive and risky to operate at first, but the lower the BCH cap is, and the higher the Tether cap is, the more easy and less risky the machine becomes. And ofc market sentiment becomes your friend the longer you can keep the machine running.",

Remember the goal isn't to net out any profit (it's all fake money to begin with) but to suppress price in order to support narrative (store of value).\n\nSo as long as the machine works, the price goes ever lower, the narrative is upheld, and the market doesn't turn bullish. It's a virtuous / vicious cycle.\n\nThe Tesla example is useful but only partly helpful. There, bearish speculators were looking to profit, and got wiped out by bulls. Here, attackers are seeking to manipulate price, don't particularly care if they ever profit on these trades (they usually do), and as long as it works the narrative is sound and there are no bulls. Again, the reason cap is important here is to paint the tape and set the market sentiment.\n\nEdit: also in the context of a hashwar the machine really only needs to run for maybe a year or two until the war is over and the narrative is established. Maybe you kick the machine back on every now and then to remind the bulls to stay away from this cow.",
