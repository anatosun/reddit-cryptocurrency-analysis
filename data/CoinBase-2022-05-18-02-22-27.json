Do they not know who I am yet? My info hasn\u2019t changed and I\u2019m on the site regularly. Am I missing something?",

And I would never contact coinbase support as I know better for if there\u2019s an actual issue I\u2019m better off taking an L and trying my luck on a different site instead of going through that headache. As for trusting coinbase staff only\u2026 I don\u2019t even trust my own mother why would I ever trust coinbase staff that\u2019s like telling me to trust the dealer at the casino lol next ill be trusting the used car salesman lol but thank you anyway I needed a good laugh. I hope you have a wonderful day and keep up the good work \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d",
