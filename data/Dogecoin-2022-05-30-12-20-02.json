He's been doing it for awhile. \n\nOr this could be the one where he pumps us to the next levels. \n\nEither way its a win for doges if we are investing right and not over invested. For many of us newcomers it has showed us the ropes of crypto, Year one. \n\nI imagine the dogefather has profited greatly over this last year and he does have a long term plan. \nHe will give it back, to all of us & a spread humanity faster than any government will. Doge is the tool that will transition normal people into better lives maybe rich lives. \n\nTbh low price point buy in is a great thing if you can stomach the losses. Ive learned alot in these years, mostly never to expect anything and most things in the crypto space are false and fake hoods, professionally done. \n\nAnd if elon used us to become the worlds richest man and push the dream of our future forward so be it. Hold the coins, buy more (only what can be afforded or just wait) everything happens in cycles. \n\nElon has shown us how this game works, it is up to you to decided how devoted and how much faith you have in him\n\nWe and way down and it all depends how u look at it. \nIll never stop loading up on doge, slowly, surely & faithfully. \n\nAnd one day it will truly pay off,\nOr not.\nWatch, learn, love & do only good everyday.\nCheers shibes!",
