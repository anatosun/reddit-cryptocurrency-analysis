It\u2019s literally the same version but with multiple upgrades that will make it somewhat unrecognizable from today\u2019s Ethereum in terms of transaction performance.\n\nAnd the way that Ethereum will make this huge shift in performance happen is through sharding which in layman\u2019s terms means that L2s will get a shot of anabolic steroids and will enjoy optimized peak performance.\n\nThis will be especially beneficial and compatible with Zero-knowledge solutions which is exactly why we\u2019re seeing so many scaling solutions focus more on ZK tech. Polygon alone already allocated more than $1 billion solely for expanding their Zero-knowledge arsenal and already have 4 of them right now (Hermez, Zero, Miden, Nightfall).  \nThis is without mentioning the other scaling solutions that have started developing ZK tech recently as well like Zksync and Loopring\n\nAll of this coupled along with the move from PoW to PoS will give Ethereum a HUGE advantage over other chains and will finally silence the criticism about Ethereum being unsustainable and inefficient.",
