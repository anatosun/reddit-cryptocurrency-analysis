It is the EU version of the card and it seems this one has the above \"limitations\". Unfortunately, that makes it utterly useless in all regards. Wish they would have been clear and transparent about that before going through the hassle of ordering it, funding it, and using it, only to realize it was all a trick.",

It's absolutely useless to only be able to spend on the above-listed cryptos because a) they're not stable coins, so it's subject to fluctuation and not appropriate for everyday spending, and b) it triggers a sale and tax event every time you'd spend in those cryptos, unlike with USDC., and c) there is no cashback with this card. The only reason I'd use it would be for the 4% cashback. \n\nAll of this should have been communicated before selling me the card. \n\nPlease refund the order fee, and maybe in the future if you're able to match the original conditions for this card version, I may give it another try. But for now, there is zero reason to use it.",
