The key part why this isn't happening is because all miner nodes run segwit nodes. There is no hashpower to built a block on the old rules. Which is kinda ironic since it means for the network to work and not fork all miner nodes ARE REQUIRED to upgrade. There is no backwards compatibility. And also ironic, that it shows, non-mining nodes have no power, another false argument often heard from the BTC crowd.\n\n\n>Yes of course if BSV or BCH had became the chain with the most cumulative sha-256 work that still spawned from the genesis block, that would be bitcoin.\n\nDon't dismiss it as BTC has won. If you want to apply nakamoto consensus, then the game is still on, if BSV overtakes BTC you have to call it Bitcoin. Let me say that I very much doubt that you would accept BSV as Bitcoin.\n\nOr how about ETH overtaking BTC in work done?",

A white paper was written which was imprecise, as technical marketing documents must be. There was no formal specification, backed up by mathematical proofs of correctness. There was a belief and a public statement that there should only be a single implementation of bitcoin. Later, this turned into \u201ccode is law\u201d. Eventually, after there were multiple competing codebases there were DDoS attacks on nodes.\n\nHahaha oh my god try applying this logic to \"peer to peer cash\"\n\nHe describes the consensus mechanisms in pretty good detail for a high level whitepaper.\n\n>The question is where do we go from here.\n\nWherever it makes sense for each individual to want to go. It's a free world. People will use crypto for whatever it is useful to them for. You can resent them for that if you want. I embrace it and seek out the solutions for my problems and don't expect others to do any more than that either.",
