It requires substantially more effort. \n\nTo accept onchain Bitcoin one has to simply share the address.\n\nTo accept Bitcoin via Lightning you have to have a Lightning node, have channels open and have inbound liquidity. Furthermore your node needs to be online at least once every two weeks, but really it's recommended to keep it online 24/7 as it has to be online the moment you want to receive.\n\nYou can kind of get around this by letting someone else manage your channels, or use watchtowers, or receive the payment and have that open a channel to you too. None of those really reduce the challenges, they just offload them to other people or use an onchain tx.",

I hope the nerdy guys recognize this.\n\nSpeaking as a \"nerdy guy\" plenty of people told me email and the internet were too complicated and therefore a fad. These things didn't get materially simpler, but people educated themselves and once the knowledge hit critical mass it became recognized as simple.\n\nThere was a time when deciding which wifi network to connect to or the difference between wifi or xG internet was considered too complicated. The same attitude came up with regard to user interfaces of PCs and mobile devices.\n\nThere's nothing unattainable about the knowledge for someone who wants to use the lighting network. There may be meager reductions in complexity but far more likely people will do what it takes to learn about it.",

Its design means that the more money you have on there, and the more you use lightning, the less trouble you have with routing as your node becomes more established and you have more inbound and outbound capacity. So there is a kind of chicken and egg problem, in the sense that most people might dip their toe in, so to speak, and not really experience what its like when you have serious node liquidity and everything works fine.",

I didnt argue that it did. The way for an asset to become money, however, is not BY merchants accepting it. You are getting it backwards. Merchants accept goods BECAUSE it is money (or a quasi money). Merchant adoption is a symptom of Bitcoin's success, not a driver of it. Bitcoin will become money because it is held and demanded by billions of people to store value and escape inflation and surveillance. When it has saturated the globe, stabilized in price, and become the global unit of account, it will then naturally attract merchant adoption (because they can reliably price their goods in it) - but you don't get to hyperbitcoinization BY spending it; that actually has the opposite effect. You get to HBTC by hodling it.",
