There's nothing you can look at outside of BTC itself to determine whether it is currently undervalued, overvalued, or fairly valued. So why we've achieved a particular price, or can't get out of a particular price range, doesn't have an answer outside of the confidence of other holders. BTC has measured the current emotional heat of BTC holders, and the current answer is 30k. That's the only \"why.\"\n\nThere \\*are\\* other rational answers possible, but they will all boil down to the answer I just gave. The stock market was over-priced and is correcting, for instance. Paper losses in their portfolios lead people to make moves with other assets that, in this case, includes exchanging BTC at 30k. So whatever alters the cumulative mood of BTC holders will move the price.",
