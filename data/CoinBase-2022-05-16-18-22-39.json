The 1st one claimed he was not  in a department to help me so he  ask to transfer my call, before he did that I make sure he verify my Identity which he did after he transfer the lady ask for me to identify myself and I gave her the same information and she claimed that she can\u2019t verify my account and drop the phone.\n You are playing with peoples money and patience \n\nI am still waiting to hear from  coinbase how long it will take to fix the  problem with the number of Gyen coin I bought between 16th to 19th of November amount  at 0.0232 / 0.0672 amounting 13,884,418.487321 Gyen tokens but coinbase change the number of Gyen to 138844.184873. As per #congress hearings coinbase C.F.O Ms Alecia Haas told the hearing than coinbase will honor the amount on computer the client bought the tokens . It looks like it is not what coinbase is doing instead they cooked new figures on investors receipts",

If your account is suspended on one platform the other companies won\u2019t allow you to use their sites.  Is that sinister or what?",
