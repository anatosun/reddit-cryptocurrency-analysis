When you buy or sell btc you\u2019re essentially making this transaction with a market making company like Alameda Research.  It\u2019s not necessarily an exchange between two retail traders. There\u2019s lots of information online and YouTube videos about how it works. \n\nstock trading works the same way. Remember the whole GameStop -Robinhood- Citadel fiasco last year? Citadel is Robinhood\u2019s market maker. \n\nSo to answer your question regarding my point, I was responding to the OPs question of \u201cwho is buying?\u201c. The answer is multibillion dollar liquidity providing companies that are contracted with Coinbase, Gemini, etc to make the market.",

The fact is there are buyers and sellers all the time, which is why price is consolidating. Over-the-counter trading may also be something that is being done and would have no (direct) effect on market price.\n\nJust to note - a sell order does not equal a completed transaction. There may not be enough buy orders to match up with the sell orders for example.",

That's where hedge funds comes into play. \n\nBuy all the coins they can at a super lowe price, start pumping the BTCUSD to inflate the price with a few thousand dollars, then start selling it off to the exchanges as the exchanges need the Bitcoins to supply the retail buyers. \n\nSo in my personal opinion.  Butcoin has become a pump and dump scene for the hedge funds.\n\nAlso one more thing. Who says the exchanges like lino and binance are not selling you ghost coins at times? \n\nI mean your wallet is there with your coins. But they can sell you thin air without you knowing it.
