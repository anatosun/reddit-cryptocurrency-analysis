I cannot get an argument out of these people for why it would be a good thing, they seem to have been taught it was good and hold that belief without really knowing why. \n\n\nSomeone play devil's advocate for me and tell me the best argument for why inflation is good. I can't think of any reason it would be good and am blown away by the fact some people think it's good. Until recently I'd not met anyone who thought it was a good thing. \n\n\nOf course my rebuttal is always about how inflation means reckless gov debt and it devalues the currency, but I'm wondering if there is a better argument from my point of view. \n\n\nWhat do you guys say?",

This brings money back into the economy as opposed to \"being under the bed\". There's also directly investing in companies or ventures which also help the economy grow. So from a Keynesian perspective, inflation helps the economy via enabling investors and spenders, and punishing savers.\n* For some reason, this argument is doing the rounds but.... lending is often created via the banks printing extra money rather than using a source of existing money. Without this, the only way to get funds would be directly taking from somewhere else and so requiring their compliance to do so (if you can't directly force them).\n* In extreme cases, the government might just want to distribute wealth. Printing money is the easiest way of doing this, because not many people know how money works. People certainly know how raising taxes work, which would be how the government would distribute wealth in a zero-inflation environment, and would be far more hostile towards this than printing money.\n\nAgain for the record - I don't believe the arguments above are either beneficial or without flaws: I don't believe in Keynesian arguments such as the above and have rebuttals to this. But simply pretending such arguments aren't in circulation does nobody any favours.\n\nBy the way OP, if your associates are arguing for the benefits of inflation without being able to say why they think so, you should either insist they go and find out, or else end the discussion. Don't even try to argue against them when the ball in on their court.",

An important mistake many make is to think that the National banks are National meaning fully owned by the state and thus \u201cby the people\u201d - wrong, National banks are on shares and owned but a little group of other banks insurance companies who live up to some strongly limited acceptance criteria to allow them to own shares in the National Bank. The National bank supplies (lend our liquidity) money to the banks (who just happen to own part of their own product/liquidity supply line..). In turn example the European Central Bank (also on private ownership) who sits as another umbrella across European national banks, prints money ie increases money supply into the national banks, same system now across Europe / euro zone. Ask yourself - in which business do you produce a product like a \u201c100,- euro bill\u201d fundamentally a piece of paper with a purchasing power of \u201c100,-\u201c at the cost of let\u2019s call  it 0,80 cents and it is \u201cdurable\u201d. The banks thus produce their own product \u201cmoney\u201d ie liquidity to sell into the market as loans - at a fraction of its purchasing value.

In my opinion it is....and the only reason an economy would need to grow fast and keep people spending is if it must make up for reckless spending of a government that is too large for its pants.

Hypothetical scenario: the world population is 1b people in the world that buys 1b chickens a day, and an average price of chickens is $10. The money supply is $10b.\n\nIf population grows to 2b, that $10b is now divided among them too, so everybody can now only afford half a chicken if price is $10. Demand has increased by 100%. Since the supply of chickens is still 1b, the price of chicken is gunna go up because of increased demand. Basically if it goes to $20, it's because now only half of the population can afford it (some people will have the $20 and the other half has $0) OR the entire population can now afford half chickens for the $10 price tag and you see \"shrinkflation\" happen (talking at a high level, not accounting for corporate greed). Similarly on the expanding production of chicken to 2b, if the population doesn't grow past 1b, then there's just too much chicken. Price goes down, eventually people can now buy 2 chickens for $10.\n\nCentral banks can't control the farms or population growth, but they CAN control the money. To keep the price of chickens at roughly $10, they will need to inject $10b more in the first scenario, or contract the supply of money by 50% in the 2nd scenario. These examples are very wild \"swings\", economy doesn't change like that.\n\nThe central banks adopted a 3% target rate because it roughly coincides with (give or take) population growth rates (~1.5%) and produce growth targets (2~3%). This is why the general consensus of \"3%\" is considered good. We are either always pumping out more shit to buy, or we are shitting out more babies.\n\nThe Bitcoin model is simple. We don't *need* the bank for stability - the price should reflect the demand and supply, period, and *market incentives* should already drive prices down. In the first scenario, when the population goes up by 100%, everybody has less Bitcoin going around, the price of chickens will go up and now the same money can only buy half a chicken. People will see you can make more money in chickens, so they'll produce more, which returns the price back down. When the population growth is 1.5% and gdp is 3% a year, price of everything should drop by 1.5% a year for everyone to have enough Bitcoins to buy enough goods and entice people to spend. You will also earn 1.5% less Bitcoin every year, but saving it means it'll be worth more tomorrow than it does today.\n\nIt's perfect money.",

                    "response": "Those who say inflation is a good thing think:\n\n* It stabilizes prices (\"look how much more stable prices are today than when we had a gold standard\").\n* It \"encourages investing\" so that people don't \"hoard\" their money and instead \"put that money to work\".\n* It gives a lever for the central bank to \"help\" the economy in troubled times. \n\nUnfortunately, they're horribly misinformed:\n\n* Prices were were actually [a lot more stable](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanlewis/2016/03/03/the-myth-of-price-instability-during-the-gold-standard-era/?sh=2bd3fb94568f) when we had a gold standard, not only because prices didn't continuously increase, but because the market wasn't manipulated by central bankers and fiat had a physical connection to the real world. \n  * Another thing often said related to this is the frequency of banking panics was higher. This is true, but A. they fixed the symptom but not the problem, and B. the fix has nothing to do with money printing. The fix is the FDIC which insures people's money so no panic is ever necessary. People will get their money regardless of whether the bank fails or not. Therefore people don't need to run the bank anymore. Even if we were on a gold standard, the existence of the FDIC would mean bank panics would be far rarer. These panics often came on the heels of recessions. Of course we don't want more recessions, however recessions actually serve an important economic role: they get people to reevaluate where they're investing their money and what they're spending their money on. They serve as moments where people are moving their money from inefficient activities to more efficient activities. Recessions are economic restructuring. Do we really want to do that less often? If we artificially prevent recessions from happening, we can do this by incentivizing the inefficient behavior that would otherwise lose money and cause a recession. We should *want* to eliminate that inefficient behavior, the problem is doing it basically requires a recession. Recessions are like an immune system response - it sucks when you're experiencing it, but ultimately its usually good for your body (because it helps you not die).\n* People for some reason think \"hoarding money\" is a bad thing, even tho the same people almost always think saving money in a 401k for your future is a good thing. People think that buying stocks somehow means you're helping the economy. You're not. The purpose of the stock market is a resource allocation tool.  People blindly throwing money into index funds without thinking about what companies actually need money and are likely to be profitable, does absolutly nothing to intelligently allocate resources - in fact its more of a random allocation of resources that results in inefficient allocation. Who would have thought that giving people with no economic literacy no other choice than to put their life savings into the stock market would be bad for the economy? The fact is money is not \"put to work\". The more money floating around in the economy, the less its worth. So if you have $1 trillion of smart money invested by investors who do substantial research on how to best allocate their money, and then you have $1 trillion of dumb money that just wants to put it \"in the stock market\" without putting any effort into researching where it should go, that waters down the market, making the $1 trillion of smart money half as effective. Money is a zero sum game in that way.\n* I recently wrote [a long shpeal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/uy60yi/this_feels_like_it_belongs_here/ia2x6sv/) about why central banks don't and can't actually \"help\" the economy by providing \"economic stimulus\". So read it there, but the main points are:\n  * Price signals in the market take 6 months - 7 years (give or take a few years) to propagate and take full effect. Different signals take different lengths of time to propagate. \n  * The central bank has no special power of predicting the economy and certainly can't predict anywhere near a year out, much less 7 years.\n  * Because of this, any action the central bank takes will likely result in not actually preventing much recession, will likely result in an overheated economy once the recession is over which will hasten the next recession and make it worse than the one before it. Also, as I said above, recessions are not strictly a bad thing - they're an immune system response to a bad thing: growing systemic inefficiency. Central banks are bringing dirty stone tools to the surgeon's table.",

The reason you want people to consume and spend / invest all their money is so you can keep innovating / making better & new stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is of the opinion that if you didn't inflate money people wont spend their money , the economy will slow and we will innovate slower etc. The example i always hear is if a TV costs \u00a31000 and you know next year it will be \u00a3500 then the next year it would be \u00a3200 you would just save your money because your purchasing power is growing. i.e if you wait a year you can now buy 2 TV's instead of 1  \n\n\npersonally i call bullshit on this point of view as literally no one iv ever talked to says they spend their money because it's being inflated away. They spend for a whole host of reasons like want cool / shiny shit, they want to be entertained, want the newest technology, want the newest iphone, want expensive cloths to show off, want status items etc. Hell most of the people iv asked this question to before don't even know what inflation is / means / does or what its purpose is for. People will always want to buy shit they my just buy less useless shit. i think this argument is used a lot because it does actually make a lot of sense, however it is a gross generalisation and is a bit of a catch all argument because it is logical and is hard to argue unless you understand economy really really well (which i don't btw this is just the ramblings of someone that reads alot).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople often argue that bitcoin is the perfect example of why inflation is good. because they say people HODL it because they assume itll be worth more in the future. However, id argue that   \n\n\n1. bitcoin is inflationary by about 1.7% a year Atm and will be inflationary until 2140 bitcoin isn't deflationary it just simply has a hard cap. \n2. its super hard to buy anything with bitcoin especially at physical POS as bearly anyone accepts it and card takes 2 seconds.  \n\n3.",

Maybe this is all dog$\u00a717 so take it with a truckload of salt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets say the game is played in cycles. So anyone can choose any action with their money between cycles.\n\nLets say entityA has 1.0 units of money.  Lets just say that entityA is like a goverment which gives people money based on unconditional basic income, but it only gives a fraction of the remaining money it has to the people, lets say X=0.01. Lets say it gives only 0.01 part of that to the people. So everybody gets on the first round 1.0\\*X\\*Y = 0.001 units. Next round it will be less because entityA will have less money because it gave it away.\n\nLets also assume that people are free to exchange money based on needs etc. with other people, or just \"gift\" money etc. Other people may lend their money to other people for a small fee they give back etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow the one of the interesting things which will happen is the problem on how people should price wares. In the first few rounds they will adapt the price quickly upwards because they can sell one unit for more money because others have more money to spent because entityA gave them a lot of money.\n\nBut after a lot of rounds this changes when entityA doesn't give much money in each round (it approaches 0.0 because entityA is out of money).\n\nSo then the only way for people to make money is to exchange something with others for money.\n\nIn the end money will accumulate at the people who do the most for everybody because they pull more from others than what they have to pay for costs.\n\nIn other words, it's a zero sum game [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum\\_game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) , there is no one which can have more than 1.0 units of money and the sum of the money everyone has is always 1.0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote also that everybody has to do something to have a lot of money. There is no \"free ride\" on your money which makes a passive return without doing anything actively like it's the case in the current inflationary system(s).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow the same game can be done just with inflation and people close the the \"money printers\". One will probably get a \"unfair\" system where a entity with X money gets X\\*0.1 money by doing nothing just from the \"money printers\" in each cycle. Of course entities have to pay for stuff, which means that the ration of the outflow to X depends on X. That's exactly what we see today where entities such as big companies can get cheaper money just because they are bigger and closer to the money printer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood thing is that these things can be simulated with models of the decision making of the entities involved, etc. .",

So in deflationary economies businesses have to sell more goods for less making it harder to pay back the loan. E.g., If I borrow $1M for inventory, and there\u2019s a deflation rate of 1% (the price I can sell my goods at declines by 1%), then I can\u2019t pay back my loan unless my profit margin was larger than 1%. Supposing I had a profit margin of 1% on my $1M of inventory, I could sell the entire stock for $1,010,000. If there\u2019s 1% deflation on the value of my inventory I can now only liquidate the inventory for $1M and payback my loan with no profit. \n\nMild Inflationary regimes and mild deflationary regimes both are workable, but they do benefit different folk. Ultimately mild inflationary regimes benefit producers and businesses, while mild deflationary regimes benefit savers and consumers. And it\u2019s a political choice of which group you want to privilege. \n\nOf course once you get above mild inflation or mild deflation it seems like everyone\u2019s screwed.",

If $1000,000 is good for 1000 people, then we'll want $2000,000 for 2000 people.  The population in USA is raising approx 1% per year, we want at least 1% inflation.\n\n2) Devaluing stagnant money.  This is one of the main things you can \\*see\\* happen with BTC.  As people expect BTC to continually be worth more, people resist selling it.  This creates a type of horde economy - which can look good, because scarcity drives up value - but in practice fails as a currency.  You have to spend money if you want an economy to function, so you've got to incentivize that through depreciation.\n\nRampant inflation is bad though.  While we should generally print more money each year, using inflation as an answer for failing to balance the government's budget or to \"stimulate the economy\" can be really hurtful.  We're seeing it now.  The last two years inflation has spiked pretty hard - which is a result of about a decade of deficit spending to try to avoid any type of recession / depression.  Suddenly rent is up to $2000 a month and $15 an hour is a garbage wage.  At a steady 5% inflation the value of money drops by half in 35 years, at 7% it drops in half in only 10.  Its an exponential problem, you don't wanna calculate what 10-12% inflation would mean...\n\nEven though a tendency towards inflation is good, BTC and crypto are good too - they hold real value, like being able to digitally transfer real wealth and provide a decentralized network that allows people to move money without interference of governments.  BTC is not likely to displace the dollar, but as long as it can stick around I don't see any reason it won't remain a useful store of value.  It just won't be a real currency you swipe every day.\n\nThis is part of why many newer crypto are exploring a tendency towards inflation.  If you want to actually replace the dollar you have to give people both trust that it will hold value, but not inhibit spending.  It has to become mundane.",
