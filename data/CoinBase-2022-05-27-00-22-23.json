However, first they had a glitch where they didn't take money out of my account.  They acknowledge it as a glitch but still froze everything for 5 days until new funds hit.  2nd time was probably my fault I didn't move the money to the account but just the same I had more than the disputed money in other crypto.  Still froze everything for 6 days.  After that occurrence all my connected bank accounts disappeared so I would have to reset them up to ACH money in.  They already limited me to 250 dollars a day so would take several days to move my paychecks over.  My short term solution is to bring the money in through Gemini, buy USDC and transfer to CB.  Long term I'm working on staking in blockcard so I can switch 100% to it.",

I wont put more than I would do for instant available for the card.  yeah man go through the process of increase limit, I did and it was a day or two my limits shot up from 250 to 15k ACH.  Like I mentioned I was much higher.  But 250 is a joke.   Thats a good idea on the gemini transfer as their is only a 5 day hold.  \n\nThis 4% card adds up, What I do is when it clears, I convert XLM to BTC.  If you run the numbers you can make some serious DCA over time with this card.  \n\nExample, lets say you run 5k a month through the card, that 60k a year at 4% thats 2400 a year.  In five years that 2400 is now at 12k cash back.",
