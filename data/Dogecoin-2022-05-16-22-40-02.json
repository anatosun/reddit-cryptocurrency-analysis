I spent my teen years trying to be a straight A student and a good athlete, then joined the Marines, hoping following him into the military would make him love me. \n\nI heard him say he was proud when I graduated boot camp then call me a pussy when I told him I'd go no further because I came to the conclusion that I wouldn't kill another human, nor would I be the cause of a fellow Marine dying by my inaction. \n\nIt's taken 27 years for me to come to terms with the fact that I've never had a father, and I'm okay with it now. \n\nSo I appreciate the sentiment, but I can't make him love me. We can't make anyone love us.",
