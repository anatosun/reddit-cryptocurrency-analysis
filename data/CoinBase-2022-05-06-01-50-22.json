I contact coinbase furious and they send me an email saying:  \n\"Your account was escalated for review to restore your ability to make purchases and deposits. It has been determined that your account is not eligible for a review at this time. However, you can contact us after June 4, 2022, and we can submit your account for a review at that time.\"\n\nSo they want me to sit around and wait a month for them to decide to reopen my account? What a joke. My recommendation is take all your money off this exchange and don't even use it. How they can randomly just freeze your account with no reason or explanation and then say come back to us in a month and maybe we will open it again.",

About six days later I receive a message that either I had an ACH that was rejected or there was a glitch.  Confirmed with bank no ACH was ever attempted.  Coinbase said I had 5 days to replace the money.  That was a reasonable request.  So I initiated another ACH.  Now everything on the account is locked for 5-10 days until this ACH clears.  The ACH is $250, there would be no problem with them putting a hold on $250 worth of funds.  But my debit card that I had started using as primary is locked.  Can't remove funds, can't add funds.

I still have a few small balances on Coinbase, mostly the free stuff they give you when you answer their little questions on various coins.  Binanace has been spotless for me.  \n\n\nBut your issue sounds exactly like what Paypal has been doing to their customers for the last several years.  They create some nonexistent issue that they use to put a freeze on your account, then they simply stonewall you at every turn.  After 5 months of dealing with Paypal on the issue I sent a certified letter of intent to sue.  My account was reopened within 48 hours and no explanation was ever given.  I no longer use their service.",

I really don't know they are allowed to continue operating or how you all put up with them. If I lived in the states I'd be reporting them to every regulating agency under the sun and broadcasting their policies on every available forum. I presume they ignore overseas accounts even more than local ones, because they have no-one down here who is available to solve this. This sort of behavior would not be accepted in Australia, it would be all over the media. Americans appear to me to be tolerant to the point of absurdity. Every other business I have dealt with in the States has been beyond reproach. Coinbase is a blot on your country.",
