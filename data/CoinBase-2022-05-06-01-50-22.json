I contact coinbase furious and they send me an email saying:  \n\"Your account was escalated for review to restore your ability to make purchases and deposits. It has been determined that your account is not eligible for a review at this time. However, you can contact us after June 4, 2022, and we can submit your account for a review at that time.\"\n\nSo they want me to sit around and wait a month for them to decide to reopen my account? What a joke. My recommendation is take all your money off this exchange and don't even use it. How they can randomly just freeze your account with no reason or explanation and then say come back to us in a month and maybe we will open it again.",
