After watching some of Mike Still's videos on youtube where he goes around giving people bitcoin I'd really like to start dabbling with lightning and doing the same with friends and family.   \n\n\nMy questions are about record keeping and taxation.  \n\n\n**Technically** \u2014 If I load $100 from my cold storage onto Muun on the main chain, then used the lightning network to send $10 to 10 people, should I technically be reporting to a tax office that I disposed of the asset? If so, how do you go about making sure you keep track of this kind of stuff / the values of bitcoin at the time in dollars.  \n\n\n**Practically** \u2014 On the lightning network is it even auditable/traceable to the point where a tax office would be able to see that I disposed of the asset / used lightning to give away bitcoin for free? It's for such small amounts that I really can't be fucked. I'm interested in the answer though.",
