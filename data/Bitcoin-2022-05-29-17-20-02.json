Bitcoin has never been the same ever. \n\nIt started out when 10,000 bitcoin would buy a couple of pizzas.\n\nDuring the previous crash there was basically zero interest from any institutions. It was just a bunch of people pumping and dumping.\n\nNow we are in the stage of investors, where we have traders trying to make money from drops and increases on a daily basis.\n\nOnce institutional money goes in bitcoin will have a lot slower movement, because it\u2019s a lot harder to move one percent of say $10 trillion then it would be to move one percent of $100 billion.\n\nThe next phase will be institutional money and the major fees after that will be adoption as an actual currency. This will happen as hardware companies are working on physical wallets that the average Joe would be able to use without thinking about it. \n\nYour question is great and very thoughtful, try asking The same question in about between 2 to 5 years time in the answer will be more than obvious.
