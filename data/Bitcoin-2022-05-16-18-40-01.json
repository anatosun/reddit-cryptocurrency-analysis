This may prove to reduce the amount of wasted energy by providing an extra backstop to demand shifts by signing contracts with energy providers to shut off when asked.\n\nBitcoin mining can provide value to newly built clean energy plants who may not be able to immediately connect with the grid. It can then fund that connection to the grid.\n\n**Bitcoin is nothing but a solution to clean energy and broader sustainable energy expansion.**",

I expect that the supply will be free for 6 months, best case scenario 12 months. I don't have mining equipment, my exposure to Bitcoin extends as far as purchasing a couple of hundred dollars worth. I am based in western EU, so geography is a consideration.  \nLooking forward to hearing thoughts and potential interest to work together to mine!\n\nEdit; I guess I should have suspected that people would be sceptical, if anyone has ideas as to how I can potentially prove this is legit I\u2019d love to hear it. And no, I\u2019m not looking for any donation for information, this is a credible business opportunity.

I even bought a hardware wallet several years ago but was too nervous to actually transfer my coins to it. I figured a big company like Coinbase is probably better at security than I am, so what's the real risk? A post here last week was what finally pushed me over: pointing out that in bankruptcy, Coinbase could (and probably would) liquidate my coins to pay creditors. While I don't think it's likely that my Coinbase vault would get hacked, I do think there is a much bigger chance for Coinbase to do something dumb on the business side and go bankrupt during some particularly bad market volatility. So I bit the bullet and transferred my coins - other than the excruciating 30 seconds between initiating the send at waiting for it to show up on the other side it was very painless. TL;DR I finally pulled my coins off of Coinbase, and you should too",

They didn't say they would sell your coins to pay creditors. They said that their account holders *are* unsecured creditors. The implication of that is that if they go bankrupt, they owe you the value of your holdings. Of course that might not work out well, just look at how Mt Gox handled it, but they absolutely can't sell your coins to cover debts to other creditors. That would be insane.",
