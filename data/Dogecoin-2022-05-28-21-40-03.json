I always wanted to go on campus at this one particular school but sadly I will probably only be doing online classes there. At least I will finally have the opportunity I always wanted. \n\nParents said they would put me in college, instead they bought a new car to impress a neighbor. My mom literally had the money and showed me and I was so happy after she said \"you can go to school now.\" \n\nI never stopped myself from moving forward, but everyone else trys to. I see myself as a hybrid mixed between a tank and a steamroller",
