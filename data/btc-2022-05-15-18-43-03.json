            "selftext": "Hello, essentially my ledger is showing that I have amount X in my accounts, which is about 10% higher than the expected amount Y after I sent a little BTC from an exchange to it. I looked at \"latest operations\" and added up everything my ledger has said I received over time and it adds to the expected amount Y, yet the display says X.\n\nJust curious if anyone else has experienced this and what could be the problem. Surely I didn't receive 10% MORE BTC than expected, but at the same time I've only ever seen a ledger lag and show a smaller amount.",

Try using Electron Cash with your Ledger and see if it gives you the right balance.\n\nIn my experience, these bugs are triggered by using different wallets with the same seed. The Ledger Live software is somewhat intolerant to transactions or receiving addresses that it did not produce, especially if any address reuse was involved. For example, if you have an older wallets that reuses addresses  for change.",
