            "selftext": "Hello, essentially my ledger is showing that I have amount X in my accounts, which is about 10% higher than the expected amount Y after I sent a little BTC from an exchange to it. I looked at \"latest operations\" and added up everything my ledger has said I received over time and it adds to the expected amount Y, yet the display says X.\n\nJust curious if anyone else has experienced this and what could be the problem. Surely I didn't receive 10% MORE BTC than expected, but at the same time I've only ever seen a ledger lag and show a smaller amount.",
