            "selftext": "Hey guys, what do you think about that prediction that the next big phase of blockchain development will be in layer-2 solutions, primarily on Ethereum?   \n\n\nSo, the industry's shift away from bridging between L1 blockchains and toward L2s. I'm constantly impressed at how L2s improve dependability, lower expenses, and increase accessibility. L2s are continually being built and improved, which is excellent.  \n\n\nThese L2 solutions, such as Metis, Arbitrum, and others, are quite useful, and I'm not sure how we'd utilize Ethereum without them.  \n\n\nWhat do you think, and which of these options do you think it's the best one?  \n\n\nSo, do you feel that as the L2 utility grows, the Ethereum L1 will organically expand in usage, cementing Ethereum's position as the world's leading smart contract and decentralized application platform?  \n\n\nL2s maintain Ethereum's blockchain security while giving consumers a simple way to avoid expensive ETH gas costs at fast speeds.  \n\n\nWhat can we expect from L2 following the ETH 2.0 upgrade? What are your thoughts?",

The two major upgrades coming to Ethereum next are The Merge which merges the consensus layer (previously eth2) with the execution layer (previously eth1) - so we're all one Ethereum again! The next major upgrade after that is data sharding on the consensus layer side. Data sharding is actually focused on accelerating rollups. So, Ethereum L1 scalability will be limited for the foreseeable future, while rollups will scale through the roof!\n\nTl;dr: Ethereum's roadmap is rollup-centric and designed to accelerate and empower rollups.",
