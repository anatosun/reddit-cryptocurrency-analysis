It still works with cheap fees.\n \nBitcoin would require tether print another 70 Billion USDT unbacked tokens to make Bitcoin try double in price. So that sounds like a huge uphill battle that could result in permanent failure for the maxis.\n\nBCH only requires a few hundred million to probably 10x in price. \n\nFunny how you are here wasting your time commenting. I take it as a good signal that BCH is a threat.",
