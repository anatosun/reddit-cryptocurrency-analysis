I wanted to see if anyone wanted to help...\n\nI am a novice mountain climber, former rock climbing instructor and rock climber, lifelong athlete and gym rat. The past few years I've been getting more and more into daily endurance treks summitting mountains. In the past few years, I've topped 9 peaks in Colorado over 14000 feet. Elbert, Bierdstadt, Evans, Quandary, Gray's, Torrey's, Shavano, Sunshine, and Sherman.\n\nI am planning, in a few weeks, to drive out to Colorado, and spend a period of 6 weeks attempting to summit as many Mountains as I can in that time. Aiming for 25-30 weather permitting. I'll be wearing doge gear as I do this, and posting this as proof to this reddit. \n\nThis will be happening with or without the support of our community. I have many Doge and will sell 10,000 of my own personal funds if necessary. I just wanted to reach out, and invite the rest of our community to join in supporting my effort. \n\nI will be climbing all of these mountains, alone, unassisted. Just me, my gear, phone, and backpack.\n\nAt each summit I will promote Doge. \n\nThis will be known as 'Expedition Doge 2022'.\n\nUpdate and Edit: Also considering starting a gofundme and have this be a charity event as well. Open to ideas for the cause, but my personal recommendation is for stray animals.",
