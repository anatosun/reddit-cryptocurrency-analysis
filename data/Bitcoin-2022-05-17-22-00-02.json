You need physical access to do these attacks. IMO hardware wallets are even more secure than paper wallets because they never expose the secret keys, if you ever want to transfer out of a paper wallet you'd need to input your secret key into some software like a hot wallet and doing that immediately compromises security. So I personally wouldn't hesitate to get a cold wallet (I've got a Ledger Nano S) as its far more secure than a hot wallet.",

The problem with currently popular algorithms is that their security relies on one of three hard mathematical problems:  the integer factorization problem, the discrete logarithm problem or the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem. All of these problems can be easily solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor's algorithm.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",
