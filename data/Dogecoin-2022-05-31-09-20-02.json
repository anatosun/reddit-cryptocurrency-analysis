Not trying to be a worshiper of Elon but Elon keeps on saying Dogecoin Trillionaire. \nIn theory, its possible:\n\nAccording to Google: 1 USD= 11.56 Doge\n\nDogeCoin Trillionaire = 1000000000000 Doge (12 Zero's)\n\nQuick Conversion: 86500700655.68 USD\n\nwhich is infact: $86,500,700,655.68\n\nThats $86.5billion \n\nElons got that. He could drop that into Dogecoin now if he wanted too.\n\nBut Elon is smarty pants. He'd want to buy his bag at very low prices... what price do you might he might buy more? \n\nI think Elon becoming Doge Trillionaire is very possible but im wondering at what cost... \n\nPost below your thoughts...",
