They  understand supply and demand quite well.  They get stuck on aspects like this and progress no further.\n\nThey don't care about minorities and civil rights, all they care about is fitness signalling via BTC (or gold, or cars, or trophy wives, children, etc.).     They do not know how economies actually work - when they do manage to work (and they don't always work) - and point to the effects of their own disruption as evidence that some economic models don't work.   LIke kicking over a sand-castle every time someone tries to build it, and then claiming \"sandcastles don't work\"\n\nThis tragic kind of stupidity is how they always want to defund beneficial government programs and avoid taxes (yet call the police or fire dept when in need) - and granted, most government gets corrupted  - problem is it's corrupted by these clowns, who then point to the effects of their own corruption as evidence \"government don't work, bruh.\"   It's mostly stupidity, not malice.\n\nSo they want to support a system that creates a hoarding of wealth.  Here, on this sub, they (generally) *feel like* BTC will enable them to do this (BTC will perform spectacularly against fiat no doubt -  it's foolish not to grab as much of it as you can -  but it will not eliminate fiat, and cannot solve this problem).\n\nIf people have less money to spend less money gets circulated throughout the economy.  I'd encourage the conservative liberarian  who wants to try to understand this to think of it like a circulatory system.  Nutrient-rich blood coagulated in a few places and not circulating freely will kill the entire thing.\n\nMost people end up with less \"disposable income\" so they can't support the very economy the \"neo-libertarian\" conservative who has gotten lucky enough to hoard has thrived off of, let alone one that might be better for everyone.\n\nIt's hard to let go of a religious belief like that.  Especially when your ego is all tied up in how much \"better\" you feel like you are than the average person.\n\nNot saying BTC is bad, not saying government is good.  Ultimately it's all \"bad\" in  that sentience is hell and there is no escape.   There are just smarter and dumber ways of dealing with that predicament.\n\nBTC is enormously useful, but it cannot fix this problem without being distributed more evenly.  And that is NEVER going to happen.\n\nCorrupted governments will very probably use CBDCs to tighten the hoarding-funded oligarch/plutocrat fist.   Fully agreed there.\n\nI know what I write will get downvoted here.  Don't care.\n\nI use BTC because it cannot be confiscated if stored properly, and its use cannot be easily censored.\n\nIf used optimally it could reduce prices of everything and decrease production of useless and environmentally harmful products.  But that is unlikely.\n\nOther than that, it's no better than any other medium of exchange.  In some ways it's worse.",
