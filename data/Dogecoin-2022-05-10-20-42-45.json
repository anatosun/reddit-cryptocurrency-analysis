Even on this subs you see memes about \"investing in\" and \"holding\" coins as a strategy to inflate value.   But that's that's not how money works that's how stocks work! \n\nto be valuable longterm, and not just a pyramid scam for whales, currency needs to be useful!  There need to be things you want to *spend* it on and reasons to choose it over alternatives.  \n\ndoge is attractive to me as construct because it settles quickly and the value doesn't change so much while you're waiting to process a transaction that you need workarounds that are based on fiat anyway.   Not as a pump and dumpo scheme. \n\nThat and puppies are cute, naturally.",
