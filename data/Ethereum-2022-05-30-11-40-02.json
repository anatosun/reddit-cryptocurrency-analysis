            "selftext": "What do you think what's the reason for this? The fact is that Ethereum gas fees have sunk to the lowest levels since July 2021, after hitting a low of $2.96 per transaction on Sunday.  \n\n\nHigh gas prices were previously the most challenging obstacle for Ethereum network investors, we had to use all of these L2 solutions.  \n\n\nI was aware that when I began working with ETH, I would face the usual issues that come with owning Ethereum, such as dealing with high gas costs and delayed transactions, so I, like everyone else, began looking for alternatives via various platforms, whether Metis or whatever else and began testing them. And now we're facing such a decrease that it confuses me.  \n\n\nWhat's the reason why is this happening? Does anyone know?  \n\n\nI couldn't believe it when I saw that Ethereum network costs have dropped this much, which is fantastic! I'm not sure what L2 solutions you use, but you've undoubtedly seen a significant decline in every one of them these days.  \n\n\nWhat do you think, how long will this downward trend continue?",
