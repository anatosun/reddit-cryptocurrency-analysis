More like they want Number go Up -- too much! But I think they're wealthy enough to take the long view on bitcoin.\n\nI think people wanting Number go UP to happen is a fine incentive. It's not a revolutionary incentive, but that's ok. There are still revolutionaries in bitcoin and they build and create without worrying about the NgU allies. \n\nAs long as all the building, creating, in bitcoin has integrity, it will be ok.",

With inflation at a realistic 10-15% a year you are forced to put your money in something that will combat it.

Before you downvote this, what I mean is that year on year inflation eventually makes fiat worthless. Seems a lot of people think the gov is going to stop printing now. This is a huge misconception. They can't stop printing even if they wanted to. They will always be printing money. Argentina may need billions loaned and where will that money come from? Printer goes brrrrrr. We are always going to print money, it just depends how much we will print at any given time. Over 40% of the total US money was printed in a single year alone (2020). Bitcoin is programmed with unlimited potential. Why? Because halving events mean every four years, the block reward will be reduced by a half. This reduces supply (opposite of fiat system). Yes demand could go down but so far its been going up. I'm placing my bets that demand goes up as fiat becomes worth less and less, and so is MicroStrategy and Tesla. I really don't know why people can't understand this basic concept.",
