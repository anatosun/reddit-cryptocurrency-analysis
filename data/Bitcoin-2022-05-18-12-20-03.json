            "selftext": "Hi, I own a business and I'm not very crypto savvy. We are about to add BTCPay as an option. I'm digging for information and can't really find anything specifically about our situation.\n\nEssentially, we push what the client pays for immediately. Low time is important. We're already comfortable with the idea of accepting the transaction as true on 1 confirmation, but what is the actual risk of accepting the transaction as true the moment the invoice is fulfilled and the transaction is created?\n\nIs there some way that bad actors could abuse this system if we view the transaction as legitimate as soon as the invoice is accepted and the transaction is created? Basically, can someone really create a fake transaction, knowing it will obviously not be confirmed? If so, is there also some way it could be abused if we required 1 confirmation?\n\nThanks!",

                    "response": "There\u2019s an option called Replace By Fee or RBF that most people have turned on in their bitcoin wallets when they send a payment. RBF means \u201ci might push another transaction spending these coins, but with a higher fee before this transaction gets confirmed\u201d. If a transaction has RBF turned on, its easy(ish) to replace before it gets confirmed (once it gets confirmed, it can\u2019t easily be replaced). \n\nDepending on the nature of your business, a reasonable policy might be \u201cwe require one confirmation for transactions with RBF enabled, zero confirmations for transactions without RBF. We encourage you to turn off RBF for faster checkout\u201d. \n\nAnother thing that might make sense (depending on your business) is turning on Lightning Payments in BTCPayServer. There is a bit more to manage compared to normal onchain payments (liquidity management is now a thing you need to deal with), but you\u2019ll get fast, cheap payments without confirmation times.",
