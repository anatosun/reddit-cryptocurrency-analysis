But if people are constantly sending small amounts of money as they browse the web the same tiny amounts of money can change hands at a massively rapid rate.\n\nIt's not like GDP though since the money is just changing hands.

A stagnant measure like bitcoin is deflationary and doesn\u2019t represent real economic output instead.\n\nGDP is the measurement of how much money was exchanged doing business. In other words it's the *velocity* of money, **not the supply of money.** It makes no sense to trying adding to the supply of a currency to match the change in GDP because then you are just arbitrarily changing the supply in ways that will feed back into changing GDP artificially.\n\nYou don't want the supply of money to measure GDP, you want GDP to measure GDP. In other words, a fixed supply allows GDP to grow when more output happens (more transactions take place) and allows GDP to shrink if less output happens (when supply drops and people start saving/conserving).\n\nInflationary money forces GDP to grow even if real output goes negative. It creates false growth via false price signals.\n\n>A stagnant measure like bitcoin is deflationary\n\nThe supply of Bitcoin is neither inflationary or deflationary. When people say Bitcoin is deflationary what they're really saying is that the cost of goods are deflationary. This happens because more goods (and more types of goods) are being produced while the demand for primary goods generally remains the same.\n\nThat is to say, a decrease in the price of goods represents the increased ease in production of that good such that we can make a lot more. If you were to debase the currency in order to push the price of that good back up to where it was you are hiding that increase in the efficiency of producing that good.\n\nBut guess what else happens? It pushes up the price of other goods too, regardless of whether they have become more efficient to produce. So maybe your food stays the same price because we have been making huge technological progress in producing food with less labor, but homes have remained scarce with much more demand than supply.\n\nFurthermore, because the currency is being debased people don't want to store their wealth in it. Instead, they search for things like homes to store their value, which artificially increases the demand for homes making them even more expensive.\n\nThis shows how changing the money supply always has negative effects on the assets which are in most demand (also known as hard assets). A fixed supply does not push the prices of the market either direction. It doesn't artificially inflate anything and it doesn't artificially deflate anything.",

Bitcoins design is not monolithic and seperates usecases so that each has their own independent evolution / vulnerabilities. \n\nSome advantages of overlay protocols like RGB/Taro are that they can scale really high like lightning, are much more private, and every Tom, Dick and Harry can 'mind their own business' off chain.

If you know something will go up x% tomorrow and again the day after, then you will simply buy more now and sell a bit in a few days. That pre-buying influences the price to go up faster than x%. It will overshoot by definition in both directions. That causes the boom-bust cycle all by itself. People try to influence it with FUD and moon. Sometimes exchanges or shticoins get hacked which causes massive fears and/or dumps amplifying the cycles.\n\nIs it also amplified by the halvenings. Sure. Is that bad? I'd say no.\n\nSomething that claims to be longterm trustworthy better show that it can withstand some knocking about and then naturally come back into balance without exploding. Anything works as long as nobody touches it. A robust system survives knocking and kicking and attacks.\n\nSeeing as it would have been trivial for Satoshi to have made the halvening smooth per difficulty adjustment period or even per block. I think it indicates that she did not do that on purpose.\n\n>In the months leading up to the halvening price skyrockets, becomes overvalued, then eventually pops and busts, and bleeds back down to a more reasonable valuation.\n\nAnd by \"knowing\" that you can front run that move and get rich. Unless it turns out that everybody \"knew\" that and was already frontrunning you.\n\nBubbles are good. They prove both FUD and moonboys wrong. They remind everybody that predicting the future is for scammers only. They prove gamblers to be not geniuses. They separate those who just want to get rich quick from those who actually understand and believe. And they prove that Bitcoin survives whatever is thrown at it.",

I do not think that is necessarily productive. We need to be looking at what btc is and how it performs the functions it was designed to perform, mainly act as money.

That doesn\u2019t have to change what the underlying thing is, it just changes the applied use of the thing. A (probably bad) analogy I think of for what is being said is that a satoshi could be like a shipping container. Shipping containers are commodity, generally plentiful, well trusted and understood for their purpose. You can put anything in them - xboxes, crates of avocados, trash, gold bars. Their features are obviously physical - a certain volume, maximum loaded weight etc. If you look at a shipping container from the outside you have no idea what it is worth in total because you don\u2019t know what is inside but the vessel has a well understood value. Sats could be used in the same way. They could be used to pair with digital payloads whose value would be far higher than the sat. The sat is the shipping container - well understood, reasonable cost for the value it provides. Building other block chains that are specifically for certain things is like saying \u201cthese shipping containers are only for bananas, these are only for dirt bikes\u201d. There can be value in that if the container is purpose built (like a refrigerated shipping container) but with digital assets, it\u2019s easier to add features to Bitcoin through the normal rfc and merge request process than standing up a competing coin (which will always be compared to btc). That\u2019s where the wasted creativity comes into play. As crazy as it sounds, trying to make new coins is less potentially lucrative than making new technologies enabled by btc. People who get this will probably be the ones to say \u201cmaking a billion dollars is cool, but you know what\u2019s cooler? Making a trillion dollars\u201d. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk",
