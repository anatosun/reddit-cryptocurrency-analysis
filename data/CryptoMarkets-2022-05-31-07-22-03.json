So like literally you can short or long the funding rate.\n\nSo maybe Is a dumb question. But if this derivative is based on Bitmex Interest Rate Swap, and Bitmex predicts the next funding rate each 8 hours, isnt this contract the easiest to win?\n\nIf Bitmex predicts a lower funding rate to be applied in, lets say, 15 mins. isn't eays just short the delta contract and earn? or am I missing something else?",
