So instead of your town printing easily faked local currency to try and promote local shopping in participating local shops, you used a SLP token on top of BCH. \n\nI think it would have worked but it would have needed a wallet that could be \"locked\" to only use the designated SLP token and be simple to use and unfortunately I don't have the skills to make that so unfortunately it was only ever a idea but yeah, I believe it would have worked and been a excellent tool for local business groups to use to try encourage the local economy.",

If output address starts with *q* or *1*, it has to be your address, otherwise it has to be a hash of the correct smart contract. The idea there is we can start trading the merchant's BCH with its own exchange rate - like how Amazon $ are typically worth 20% less. A blockchain may be safer than relying on gift card codes.\n\nEven if SLP is more convenient and practical, using smart contracts instead might be **less risky**, if there's a high chance of an exit scam. In that case the BCH stuck in smart contracts might still have some sentimental value in the future, as half-burnt BCH (like a shredded USD) and the victims have their money burnt instead of stolen. There's an SLP solution, but it wouldn't let us trade the store credit (revealing the secret to spend the token, allows the BCH to be released, so we can't trade).",
