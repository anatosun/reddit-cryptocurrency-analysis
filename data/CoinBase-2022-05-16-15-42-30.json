            "selftext": "Hi all, I bought a new Nano S and yesterday I set it all up and tried to transfer my crypto onto it.  First I did my Bitcoin and It gave me a message that it could take up to 15 minutes (I think) to transfer. Almost instantly I received an email saying it sent it to the account I gave it.  Within a few minutes I noticed the it was now showing up in my Nano \"Leger-Live\" and was gone from the Coinbase account. No problem.\n\nNext, I did the same procedure for my Dogecoin.  This time it said It may take up to \"6 hours\" to transfer.  Once again I received and email saying it sent to the correct account.  Well it's now been over 12 hours and the dogecoin is still in the coinbase account and not showing up in my Leger-Live.\n\nWhat gives?",
