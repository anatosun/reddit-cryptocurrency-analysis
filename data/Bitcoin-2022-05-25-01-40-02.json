Court ordered them to pay up what was owed and they decided to just pay in Bitcoin instead. My grandpa claims he still has paperwork and everything. But at the time no one knew what Bitcoin was so my grandpa considered it a loss. How would we recover this? What information would they have sent to my grandpa for him to cash it out? They sent roughly 700 Bitcoin because at the time it was cheap. I keep trying to explain to my grandpa that this is big money but he has a hard time understanding. If I know which documents to look for then I may be on the right track to helping him. Thanks",
