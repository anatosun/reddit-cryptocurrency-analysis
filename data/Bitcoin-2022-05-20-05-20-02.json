I never speak negatively about it and wonder if I should own some.\n\nIt seems a lot of respectable people call BTC and E\\*T\\*H the bluechip cryptos. What I think I'm learning, is that this narrative comes from the 2017 crypto class that bought into E\\*T\\*H and watched its ecosystem explode over the next four years. There are a lot of reasons why E\\*T\\*H is not in BTC's league. I'm curious if anyone else is like me and starting to realize the only crypto we really want to store our savings in, is BTC.\n\nThe more I research, study, experience, and learn - the stronger my conviction gets for BTC and temptation for E\\*T\\*H declines.",

Even after the broad market selloff in the past 8 weeks, this kind of action in the stock market means that the Market Makers think the downtrend is still not over.

Maybe it's the reaction of the market to Europe's news that they will be raising rates this Summer? Whatever the reason is, the market is undoubtedly skeptical and acting like there will be more drops ahead.",

I think some have given up on answering questions like this because we've seen it so many times :-P. \n\nI will tell you, after the run-up in 2013, I sold some. Then I accumulated over the next 4 years but I didn't pay any attention to daily happenings(granted, there wasn't as much going on back then as there is now). It was the same in 2017... I sold a bit but then started accumulating again when it settled in that 8-12k range. After 2017, I had my account set to buy 20-50 dollars every 2 weeks and forgot about it. I didn't check this sub or the news much at all. \n\nI think now is the same. That run-up to 69k and now it's settling. No one can really say if it's settling now. This little 28-31k range is nice but I still think we could see fluctuations further down. If this range goes on for 2 or 3 more months, I'm going to set the auto-buys again and go into hibernation for a few more years. \n\nWith this particular run-up to 69k and no matter where it settles... I won't be selling this time around. Sats are more expensive now so I'm hanging on to every last one of them I accumulate. I'll be a millionaire or my sats will be worth 0(I just don't see 0 happening though).",

I thought it was confirmed with the continuous upward movement from Jan til early April, albeit with a lot of pumps and dumps along the way, but still up, so I bought.

Next cycle will feel like \"wow, we're finally legit!\" when we get spot approval, which allows for institutional buy-in, regulation, and alt-market shake out. \n\n...but we'll still crash down again, and rise up. \n\nThe cool part is that we'll maintain higher lows, so crashing down to $70k - $80k may be dramatic, but also make sense if we look at history. \n\nThe cycle after next will be insane, though. That's the one that pushes us closer to $1m per coin. We may not reach it, but Bitcoin should be a global force by 2030. \n\nYou don't have to believe that. It's fine if you downvote. Just watch. The cycles are real. I've been in BTC since 2011 and every time you think it's going great, it \"dies\" and then is reborn to rise higher again 1 year after every halving. \n\nOnly ever new time more people buy in and legitimacy increases.",

Whales dump the Bitcoins pretty often - open short positions - win the bet and then buy for cheaper. Win-win situaci\u00f3n.
