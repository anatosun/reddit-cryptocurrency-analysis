                    "response": "I'd suggest Guarda. It's a non-custodial wallet (you own your private keys therefore your Bitcoin and other assets are completely yours and not controlled by anyone else) and you can buy and exchange Bitcoin right there in the wallet. For purchases you can use credit or debit card, as well as SEPA transfer. The wallet prompts you to save a backup file every time you create or delete a wallet so that adds a security layer for restoring your wallet in a new device if needed. You can save individual private keys and protect your wallet with your unique password. It's a user-friendly crypto storage, with some cool features, and imho, it's suitable for beginners and experts. \nSurf their website to discover more details. \n\nhttps://guarda.com",

                    "response": "Other people have linked to resources to find the wallets. The reason that its important to have the bitcoin in your own wallet is that if you have coins on an exchange and that exchange ceases to exist then any coins that you had on there will also go away as we've seen with exchanges like Mt Gox or more recently Quadriga where they shut down and took people's coins with them. So having your own wallet and taking your coins off exchanges ensures that any bitcoin you have purchased is held by you and no one else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood suggestions for wallets are sparrow, samourai or if you want to ensure your coins are even more secure you can get a hardware wallet such as a ledger or trezor.",

Keeping those words private is 99% of bitcoin security. It's your primary concern. For an added level of security (and more wallets with the same seed), use wallet passphrases, store them separately.",
