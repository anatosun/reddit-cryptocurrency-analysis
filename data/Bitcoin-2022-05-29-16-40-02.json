            "selftext": "Recently a trend broke in the S&P 500/Commodities index that suggests we could be headed for an equities secular bear market that could last quite a while. This is usually followed by a commodities boom.\n\nSince there are only ever going to be 21M bitcoin and there is no central bank to add to the supply as the bitcoin economy expands.. that would make bitcoin a commodity and due to the way the technology works (4M coins lost forever and counting) this commodity is quite scarce and will only get scarcer.\n\nBitcoin already acts as a safe haven for wealth outside the reach of greedy bankers and wallstreet charlatans.\n\nIn addition to the safe haven we know and love, we are now seeing that bitcoin can take shots at major companies such as western union in the world of money transfers with El Salvador estimating their recent adoption of bitcoin will cost money transfer companies upwards of 400M per year.\n\nThe argument that bitcoin has no real use is entirely invalid and holds no merit whatsoever, mass adoption could continue off third world money transfer savings alone.\n\nSo I guess my question is, if a commodities boom is about to happen and we are actually the first digital commodity, wouldn't it make sense that we would decouple from the stock market?",
