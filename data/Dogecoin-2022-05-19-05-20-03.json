I\u2019m an international student, and I\u2019ve kinda seen enough turmoils happening around the world. We need more understandings and signs of kindness from different parties, both inside the U.S., and across the globe. Humanities are evolving to the point where the technologies we had are too deadly for us to go to the route of hatred and self-destruction.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being extra, but this worries me. The doge coin community is supposed to be the community of kindness, hence the best spot to have a movement, where we spread the idea of kindness and understanding to the world.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I can do to make it happen. But I do own a degree in computer science, and will be owning my masters in cs soon. Besides, I also align with the initiative of kindness started by the dogecoin community. And I just want to be a good person. When I die, I want to think of myself as someone who actually did something good to this world, no matter how little it might sound.\n\nSo what are the things that the community needs right now? How can we (the ones who are worried) help you?",
