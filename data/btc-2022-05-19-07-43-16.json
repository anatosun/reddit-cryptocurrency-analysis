Esspecially if Tether collapses and at the same time BCH continues to gain utility adoption like we see in the Carribian, some places in Australia, Slovenia etc.   \n\n\nTether is the single most used stablecoin used for shorting BCH and put artificial selling pressure on BCH (and conversely put buy pressure on BTC).",
