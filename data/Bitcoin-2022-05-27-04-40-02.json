When you look at market cap dominance in the crypto market as a whole, you are taking into account the market cap of every premined altcoin, proof-of-stake altcoin, and non-mined altcoin all combined with every proof-of-work cryptocurrency.\n\nSo unless bitcoin's price goes parabolic, bitcoin's market cap dominance will continue to go lower and lower as more and more premined shitcoins are created and more tethers/stablecoins are printed.\n\nYou yourself, or anyone else, can easily bring bitcoin's dominance down further right now if you wanted to just by simply creating a premined shitcoin with a large supply and then perform one single trade with yourself. You can even do this on one of those \"decentralized\" exchanges where anybody is able to list literally any shitcoin. And that premined shitcoin that you create could simply be an ERC-20/BEP-20 token smart contract on ethereum/BSC that anybody is able to create in minutes using an online ERC-20/BEP-20 token smart contract generator.\n\n[Here is a chart that shows the market cap dominance of bitcoin compared to proof-of-work cryptocurrencies.](https://stats.buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-dominance/)\n\nBitcoin currently holds 69.43% dominance over the market cap of all of the proof-of-work cryptocurrencies.",

We only know that Satoshi mined the genesis block (which can't be spent) and block 9. It's possible that Satoshi could have mined between 600,000 and 700,000 BTC but we will never know for a fact.\n\nSince there was over 3 days between the genesis block being mined and block 1 being mined (and difficulty was 1), it's safe to assume that Satoshi waited for other miners to start mining before joining in. \n\nBelow is two examples of early bitcoin miners that were mining alongside Satoshi from the start.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/halfin/status/1110302988\n\nhttps://twitter.com/druidian/status/1447833108355731462\n\nhttps://stephanlivera.com/episode/314/",

This shows to which extent Satoshi didn't want any initial advantage.\n\nI wouldn't say that Satoshi waited for the others as a voluntary action: His software wouldn't mine any blocks unless it was connected to another peer; that has always been the case ever since the initial release.\n\nSergio identified an anomaly in early 2009 blocks, and from then he takes the logic leap that they were all by the same person and that that person was Satoshi.\n\nIt's argued that Satoshi wanted to sustain the blockchain, but that's a hard sell too: Empty blocks, with no transactions, are useless. Also, there are gaps of many days mid 2009 with no blocks at all.\n\nAn alternative explanation that makes more sense: people in 2009 were using Bitcoin as a form of computer benchmark (remember, BTC the unit was totally worthless). It's crude as a benchmark, but it had the advantage that it was verifiable to others (instead of having to trust random screenshots). They used modified software that further earmarked the blocks, for that purpose. The public client published by Satoshi didn't produce the anomaly, so it's less likely that it was Satoshi doing that.",

It can end wars, it can stop mad race of growth by unlimited lending and most importantly solve the huge problem of preservation of wealth over generations.\n\nThe big problem however is distribution of currency across the entire world and of course, we still do not know who hold the majority of these currencies. When we do not know who are these whales, and what their intention is, how can we as general public trust the coin? How can we let them control the monetary policies of this world,  when lets say Bitcoin has replaced FIAT.\n\nBitcoin is always counting on underlying algorithm and network as asset. The problem I see is quantum computing computing. If humans one day are able to have the quantum computer work, would these Crypto coins be safe? Are these crypto's quantum proof? This is why I don't buy the logic that, we are buying a computer program as an asset when we buy Bitcoin. By saying bitcoin is ultimate crypto, are we saying this is the peak of evolution human computing can reach?\n\nI agree FIAT system is broken. However, Bitcoin isn't doing anything to solve this problem. In my view, a real cryptocurrency to redefine the world is yet to be born,.",

The entire investment vehicle that is crypto is not eternal, however I believe blockchain technology is. At some point all of these currencies will die and the early crowd will use retail and later waves of adoption as exit liquidity.\n\nLook at every free* market since the inception of free markets, the liquidity will always move to the next vehicle. Liquidity = smart money = the big funds/players/whales/whateverthefuck. It\u2019s inevitable that one day the curtains will come down on the whole thing.\n\nYou can throw charts and all the TA you want at me, it doesn\u2019t change the fundamental facts of the situation.",

IF they're decentralized, they're expensive, slow, and difficult to maintain things. If they're not decentralized, they serve no efficient purpose. \n\nBitcoin is not \"crypto\". That's a plural word that assumes parity. \n\nAnyone from 2009 that still has access to their coins that was going sell already has sold. If you were around back then, you'd know how tenuous bitcoin was. There was no expectation it would survive. Exchanges didn't exist. There were no venture capitalists. The coin had $0 value until Lazlo bought pizza, a year later in the first real world transaction. Since then there have been multiple 50%, 70%, 85% drops. 1,000,000,000%+ rise. Anyone still holding clearly has no interest in \"dumping\". \n\nYou have much to learn.",
