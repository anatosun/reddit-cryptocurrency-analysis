Money supply was not increased 40%, it was 29% ([source](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/default.htm), Oct. 2020 - Oct. 2021 Monetary base increase from $4,917.1B to $6,331.0B)\n2. The increase in monetary supply could have happened with any currency in place, even a ledger-based cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, since the actual increase in monetary supply was accomplished via borrowing and you can borrow crypto dollars just as easily as USD.\n3. The issue raised was not about the destabilizing effect of cryptocurrencies directly, but their use as part of a coordinated effort to drive a reduction in the economic power of Western nations including the US (specifically on the part of Russia, [source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/crypto-can-destabilize-nations-and-undermine-u-s-dollar-dominance-hillary-clinton-says-11637332449)) and love crypot or not, that is actually a concern that has some academic traction ([source](https://scholarlycommons.law.emory.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1237&context=eilr)).",

Banks, depending on country can also lend that printed money at ratios of 2000:1 or much much higher depending on jurisdiction which is further deflationary but I digress, if you think the official number of inflation has anything to do with reality you are not living anywhere remotely close to this planet but are instead in someones pocket reading a script, do something crazy and look for yourself, don't follow the bread crumbs the wolf is laying out.",

The Fed would not have any need for such a thing as they're happy to issue bonds on their own. Whether the currency of those bonds is measured in BTC or USD is irrelevant.\n\n> Fiat currencies is only using the word borrow or lending, what they mean in fact is PRINT money!\n\nThis betrays a deep misunderstanding of macroeconomics.\n\nPrinting money is the job of the Mint/Treasury. Increasing monetary supply can be accomplished without printing extra currency. In fact, if you look at the link I provided, the increase in raw currency was much lower than the increase in the monetary base.\n\nYou might want to learn more about how the Fed works before making definitive statements about it.",
