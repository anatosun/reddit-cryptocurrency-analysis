                    "response": "Start the night before with a 1 lb package of dry pinto beans.  Use a cookie sheet or ? to visually inspect the beans for small rocks, etc.  Put the inspected beans into a pot, then cover with a few inches of water - let them soak overnight (this removes a certain sugar which humans can't digest; it causes painful gas and other gut reactions).  You'll discard the soak water before cooking.  \n\nFor best results, pressure cook the beans in 7.5 cups of clean water for about 5-6 minutes once pressure has been achieved.  Otherwise, slowly simmer the beans on low heat, stirring every few minutes (so they don't burn) until the beans are tender.  \n\nCut 3/4 to 1 pound of smokey bacon into bite-sized pieces, then fry.  Add the bacon to the cooked, tender beans, along with 1/3 to 2/3 of the bacon fat.  \n\nAdd a chopped brown onion, 1-2 tsp dried oregano, a tiny pinch of dried, granulated garlic, and 1/2 to 1 tsp of ground black pepper.  Simmer until the onions are cooked.  Finally, add some salt, carefully - you can always add more, later, but you can't remove it if you add too much.  Optionally, add a few good shakes of Tabasco.  \n\nServe with rice.  I prefer brown rice.  Corn tortillas are nice too; warm them on the stove burner, flipping every few seconds until slightly 'toasty'.  Pretzels also work well with beans.  \n\nYou can get most most/all of the ingredients at a \"dollar\" store.  Invest in a good pressure cooker: Beans, split pea soup, whole chicken, braised roast beef with potatoes, carrots, celery, and onions... Steamed veg: Artichokes, broccoli...  At one point I owned two pressure cookers.  I can't imagine living without at least one.",

If you do it 7 days in a row you get 250 sats. Not a lot but hey it's free and easy. You can also use fold to buy gift cards to major retailers and get sats back as rewards.
