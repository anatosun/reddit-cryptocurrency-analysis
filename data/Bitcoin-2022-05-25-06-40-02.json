It\u2019s what Warren Buffet and Elizebeth Warren say about bitcoin. \n\nTechnically they\u2019re right that we hope to sell it at a higher price than we bought it, and it doesn\u2019t have inflows or backed by any physical asset. \n\nThen again any stock or commodity or any investment involves buying to sell at a higher price. Bitcoin just doesn\u2019t have any inflows or physicality. \n\nI think what they\u2019re missing is that it\u2019s a safe way to self custody money, censorship resistant transactions, cross boarder convenience, and what\u2019s most hard to imagine currently that every bitcoiner hopes for, a store of value. \n\n\nHow do you all respond to this criticism?",

If it does get global adoption and become a medium of exchange that holds its value (currently disinflationary), then its market cap will be much larger than it is now, and you will be able to borrow against it, like you would real estate....or use it to save and not worry about having your savings eroded.\n\nAt which point you have a store of value that you can use to buy and sell things. It's this vision that might eventuate that means you aren't just holding in the hope to sell for a higher price.

This is literally the basis of investing. \n\nWhy do people buy stocks? To be able to get more money than what they put in, via appreciation and dividends. The fact that there is a company behind is irrelevant and just one way to get more money - for gold, there is literally nothing backing it except for trust. For real estate, it\u2019s an asset that does not produce anything either (actually it needs maintenance). \n\nIt\u2019s the entire point of investing - keep your wealth in assets that do not depreciate over time.",

In fact, we know exactly where it is in the asteroid belt, and the sheer amount is so large its meaningless to price it.\n\nHonestly, if there wasnt so much government red tape, spaceX or a similar private firm could be bringing home gold mountains within a couple years. There isnt any fundamental technology barrier stopping us from doing it today.",

                    "response": "You can buy shares in companies, and there simply is no company that is immune to changing times, hard times, etc. There is risk of more competition (Uber vs a hundred ride apps), regulation (Coca-Cola vs sugar regulation, how would that go if it happens? or what of supply issues), poor strategy (IBM comes to mind), corruption (Enron) etc. etc. Companies DO THINGS, so in contrast to what these people say, that's actually the risk that you need to consider, because they can DO them wrong. So buying into an index makes sense for risk management, but that doesn't protect you from downside in truly bad times, as the 1930's illustrated. And which index? place your bets on which governments will run their economies in the right direction.\n\nSo what about buying property? Well that involves exposure to the government, the state, the city and the neighborhood. Does the locale get better? worse? Is an apartment block soundly built, or will it crack through the middle like we're seeing in many fully developed nations these days due to corruption and slipping construction standards? What about flooding of the area, fires, hurricanes, earthquakes? Drought? Riots and looting? Governments turning on citizens with draconian restrictions, making the region miserable to be a resident in? General wear and tear, insects etc. etc. all risks one has to shoulder specifically because property has \"physicality\", THAT'S the risk. And who can afford it without going into enormous debt? Another risk.\n\nOk, then you buy commodities... where do you store them? You own some gold in London or New York... really? Will they honor that when the times come where you would need them to? Times where civilization is being rocked by crisis after crisis? Do you trust those bankers to conduct themselves with that degree of honor and dignity? Do they even have your commodities? Well... maybe you don't trust that they do, so you could store thousands of litres of oil, some diamonds, gold and silver at your place then right?... oh, back to risks in relation to where you live; riots, looting, or just plain burglary even when times are good. And holy shit, have you seen commodities move in the market? What if they flood the market with too much? They look like shitcoins on occasion.. better time your entry.\n\nFine, so let's trust and invest in our government. Governments DO things. They do wars, they do sweeping policy changes, they do geo-political jockeying. Let's sit in their cash while they inflate the shit out of it, or buy bonds for a dismal return, or even Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities! This guarantees the government will print more money just for you, to protect you from all the money they're printing. Yeh well, sounds great, except in truly hard times, governments split, governments default, because they can DO the wrong things, and there is fuck all you can do about it. In other words, a lot of us are here specifically because we don't like the direction our governments are going... and where's the upside? You're gonna become a professional money manager now? Time the market? because bonds don't do shit against any investment mentioned EXCEPT when times are unstable enough to also start questioning the governments. Might as well get a mortgage and play the inflation game with a roof over your head if you want to put money down on government stability.\n\nSo I dunno... I quite like how little Bitcoin does. An agreement was made, in code, and since then it just does the same damn thing, over and over - tick tock, another block every \\~10 minutes. Quite predictable. Provably scarce. With a built in way to securely store them, protecting them from theft, loss and even nation state attacks. All with the ability to transact them with finality to anyone you damn well please, anyone you need to. I'm so glad it's not a running business, I'm grateful for its lack of \"physicality\". It's a genuine paradigm shift and comes with risks like anything else in life.\n\nThat'd be my response.",

So I would start by understanding buffets argument so you can tackle it properly. \n\nBuffet says the same about gold (and other commodities) as he does Bitcoin. \n\nStocks (at least the ones buffet invests in) are producing assets. They have earnings. The $100 the company he invests in will become $110 the next year because they buy goods and labor and turn them into other good and sell them for more than their cost. Fundamentally then, buffet doesn\u2019t need the stock to go up in price; the company produces earnings. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t produce anything; it\u2019s just a protocol and can be used. Same as gold. Again, buffet is against gold for the sam reasons as he is against bitcoin. It just sits there and looks pretty and doesn\u2019t actually produce anything. So the only \u201creturn\u201d you get is when you sell it higher.",

                    "response": "Gold doesn't generate any money, so why does gold have any value? You'll probably say cause it has a physical form and it can be used in jewelry and electronics. but actually the majority of golds value doesn't come from that, it comes from the fact that so many people accumulate gold meaning there's a lot of demand which is causing scarcity.\n\nCash doesn't generate anything. It does have a physical form too. Cash's value must come from our ability to use it as paper airplanes right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr what if, maybe, cash is a collective agreement between everyone to come to a collective decision that our value can be stored in these certificates and later redeemed for other valuable goods and services at a later date, and we will all accept these as payment and use them for payment. And what if this agreement to use one thing benefits everyone, and we all gravitate toward this phenomenon naturally? And what if bitcoin is the natural evolution of that phenomenon? Gold again has its limitations and its own inflation too. Cash maybe was somewhat more easily transferable, but still left a lot to be desired. Bitcoin seems like it sort of comes out of left field as an immovable object from another dimension, totally reliable, totally stable, totally open, simultaneously confounding and simple, unstoppable, impossible for any individual alone to control the protocol. Essentially controlled by the users. If we were making a pizza shop id agree it should exist in physical reality. But were not, were talking about the next evolution after gold, cash. And were talking about the next evolution after cash, digital cash. And were talking about the next evolution after digital cash, when we now go back to what you might call \"digital gold\". Bitcoin combines the appealing properties of digital cash with the appealing properties of physical gold. Its not a pizza shop. If Buffett wants to invest in pizzashops I have no problem with that. Its a shame he has a problem with me, I never belittle his pizza shop focus. But I see his perspective, after a lifetime of success with pizzashops and a near perfect track record, maybe there's something to be said about sticking to what you know and just opening another pizza shop. Buffett has a hyperfocus on one thing. Buffett is an accountant by trade. His main focus is comparing the accounting metrics of different institutions and deciding if their value is significantly higher or lower than it should be. Warren Buffett is a great investor who has proven himself time and again. I employ many buffettisms in my life. I don't try to time the market for example.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThink of it this way. You've lived a life of incredible success. You run a hedge fund and you've never fucked up. A genie comes out of a bottle and tells you you have 10 years left to live and have 2 choices. continue your perfect track record, keep opening pizza shops. OR take a chance on this new technology which will probably be a household name in the near future and everyone will own some and use it to store their value. What does Buffett choose? He chooses the safe approach. Cause there's something to be said about preserving what you have. Which ironically is why bitcoin makes so much sense and appeals to the average person so much. One day Buffett will look down and see this.",

Honestly one of the reasons I think Bitcoin will actually never take out as \\*the currency of the internet\\* is because people can't dumb it down enough for the average guy. I mean... sub itself adtervise bitcoin as the currency of the internet, but there is not a whole lot you can do with it --legally--\n\n  \nLet's face it 1 BTC = 1 BTC only holds any value for bitcoin believers. Everything else in this world has a money value tied to it, and people will most likely always talk on those terms. You can buy a car for 60k USD, you can buy a car with the equivalent of 60k USD in BTC. IMHO the more we try to distance bitcoin from the simple terms of money that anyone can understand, we are just making it hard for bitcoin to climb higher.",

Let\u2019s think of a simple example. Suppose I own a tree that produces fruits, I\u2019ll have an easy time selling it at a certain price depending on the amount of fruits it produces. If you buy it, and the tree starts producing more fruit during your time of ownership, you\u2019ll have an easy time selling it at a higher price.\n\nWith gold I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re talking about possible counter fitting, which can be tested for, or if you\u2019re saying that gold only has value because everyone says it has value. If it\u2019s the latter then I would point to the fact that it can be used for plenty of things. Electronics, medicine, etc. It\u2019s a commodity.\n\nHouses produce nothing but you can live in them.\n\nThe point I\u2019m trying to make is that all of the above produce something or can be used for something, which drives the demand for them, which in turn provides a floor for their value.\n\nWith collectibles you are indeed right. And that\u2019s also why the majority, although not all, tend to only perform well over limited time periods. Once all the people that were familiar with the collectible are gone, there really isn\u2019t really anything that drives the demand and provides a floor for the price.",
