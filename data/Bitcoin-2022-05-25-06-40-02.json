It\u2019s what Warren Buffet and Elizebeth Warren say about bitcoin. \n\nTechnically they\u2019re right that we hope to sell it at a higher price than we bought it, and it doesn\u2019t have inflows or backed by any physical asset. \n\nThen again any stock or commodity or any investment involves buying to sell at a higher price. Bitcoin just doesn\u2019t have any inflows or physicality. \n\nI think what they\u2019re missing is that it\u2019s a safe way to self custody money, censorship resistant transactions, cross boarder convenience, and what\u2019s most hard to imagine currently that every bitcoiner hopes for, a store of value. \n\n\nHow do you all respond to this criticism?",

If it does get global adoption and become a medium of exchange that holds its value (currently disinflationary), then its market cap will be much larger than it is now, and you will be able to borrow against it, like you would real estate....or use it to save and not worry about having your savings eroded.\n\nAt which point you have a store of value that you can use to buy and sell things. It's this vision that might eventuate that means you aren't just holding in the hope to sell for a higher price. It's potentially a new monetary system that can operate alongside the current one, or some might argue, replace it.",

We find it so frightening and repulsive a concept because we grow up with no literacy of markets. If we grew up and were educated and expected to interact with a market, we would see how to use the variability of prices to climb a ladder of progress with each shift up and down between any two commodities.",
