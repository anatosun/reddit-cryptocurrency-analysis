Global trade will provide thousands of these.\n2) Lightning still has to settle on-chain at some point and people (at least those with high net worth) will want to store most of their wealth on-chain rather than Lightning.\n3) At a bare minimum, there will be some quantity of transaction fees each block because either the fee is cheap (and many people will want to do it) or the fee is expensive (because of high demand for transactions driving that price up).\n\nWorst case scenario, we experience a moment in time where there are way more miners in the market than is profitable to run due to a massive decrease in block rewards post last halving. This will crash the price of miners and I suppose you might need to worry about an entity buying them up to 51% attack the network. But there would have to be an absolutely massive misallocation of capital in the mining business to create this situation.\n\nIt\u2019s not really a game theoretic problem from what I can tell\u2026 and it\u2019s certainly not an immediate issue \ud83d\ude02",
