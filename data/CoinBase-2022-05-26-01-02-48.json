            "selftext": "I transfered my BTC ETH LTC from Coinbase to Coinbase Wallet.\n\nThen I couldn't start sending BTC/LTC because of abtransaction cost calculation error.\n\nI tried to restore the wallet with my seed words after an app reinstall and now BTC and LTC are gone...the adresses show no transaction history anywhere on the internet.\n\nThe old adresses (before the restore) have no transaction activity. So the funds were not stolen.\n\n\nHowever ETH funds are available.\n\nThe same behaviour is true when importing into Trust Wallet...only ETH.\n\nI guess the wallet is either custodial with a fake seed or there is a bug in the address derivation algorithm.\n\nI lost very much mony. Thanks Coinbase!\n\nUpdate 18.02.20:\nThe support suggested to enter the address into the derived addresses settings search in the app.\nHowever, it's unlikely to bruteforce the correct address with a rate of 2 million addresses per 24h. \nETH funds are available because the addresses do not change like BTCs and forks.\n\nUpdate 19.02.20:\nThe support suggested to use another wallet software to scan the key derivation path. Coinbase Wallet currently uses the Segwit Native (p2wpkh) m/84'/0'/0' BIP84 path apparently.\n\nUpdate 24.02.20:\nI tried everything in my power. After multiple emails with the support I finally give up on my BTC. Guess I can inly hope for a miracle fix by Coinbase devs.\n\nTL;DR\nNever download Coinbase Wallet!\nDon't buy shares when they go IPO!",

Since November 23 of last year (yes, 4 months ago) THEY decided to suspend my account and I have not been able to enter since that day. I got in touch with support and they answered the first emails saying that they were passing my case to a specialist well, in these 4 months they answered me yesterday after sending I don't know how many unanswered emails. Your specialist ..... first of all he tells me to tell him the recovery phrase, which surprises me that someone in support asks you that, it is as if they asked you for the private keys but I did not give it to him since I He used coinbase from the web and that I remember there was no recovery phrase or anything well, he tells me that from there on his side there seems to be no problem for me to log in and I send him a screenshot showing him that he follows me putting that it is disabled. Send me the following message Telling me to download the app from the play store and try to link my account from there, weird also this, what is to have more downloads of the app and say that so many people are using it? sure .... no success, account disabled. After this, he answered me again that he just sent me a code and that I tell him what it is, but the mobile does not receive any code, I only receive an email with a link to change my password, I change it and then it arrives. An SMS to my cell phone telling me that my password has been changed. I mean, that my phone is fine because I get the notifications but what a coincidence that the code that says it has sent me does not arrive, weird, right? After this he tells me that without the recovery phrase or the sms code (which has not been sent and has been clear after the notifications arrive) I cannot recover my account, which advises me to either create another account or pay 20 euros for the annual pro subscription and so I can get it back .... sorry ???????? I tell him that what he says is very good but that my account contained a balance and if I create another, obviously that balance I lose it and he gives me the ticket as resolved and closes it. I have all the emails of this from the 23rd of last year until now and I plan to denounce you both individually with all these tests and in the joint lawsuit that we are putting together since we are a lot of people affected by these actions that coinbase uses. Anyone who wants tests before investing their money I can teach them without any problem. Look at [https://es.trustpilot.com/review/coinbase.com](https://es.trustpilot.com/review/coinbase.com) and there you will see what ilk they are.",
