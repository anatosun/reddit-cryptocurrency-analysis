It the most used OS on the planet and that\u2019s by a landslide as well.\n\nAlmost 90% of all cloud infrastructure runs on Linux, 100% of the top 500 super computers run on Linux, 96.3% of the top 1 million servers run on Linux, 85% of all smartphones are based on Linux.\n\nSo basically, if you\u2019re reading this right now, you\u2019re most probably using Linux.\n\nI think Cartesi is the only crypto projects with that vision in their mind cause they\u2019re the only ones with an engine that runs Linux OS which will I think will give Cartesi a lot of advantage honestly.\n\nRunning a crypto project on this OS will make it so easy for the mass populous to be able to use said project which will most probably ensure mainstream adoption pretty early on.",
