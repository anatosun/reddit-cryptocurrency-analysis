Tl;dr: Your funds are safe at Coinbase, just as they\u2019ve always been.\n\n2/ We have no risk of bankruptcy, however we included a new risk factor based on an SEC requirement called SAB 121, which is a newly required disclosure for public companies that hold crypto assets for third parties.  https://www.sec.gov/oca/staff-accounting-bulletin-121\n\n3/ We believe our Prime and Custody customers have strong legal protections in their terms of service that protects their assets, even in a black swan event like this.\n\n4/ For our retail customers, we\u2019re taking further steps to update our user terms such that we offer the same protections to those customers in a black swan event. We should have had these in place previously, so let me apologize for that.\n\n5/ This disclosure makes sense in that these legal protections have not been tested in court for crypto assets specifically, and it is possible, however unlikely, that a court would decide to consider customer assets as part of the company in bankruptcy proceedings...\n\n6/ We should have updated our retail terms sooner, and we didn't communicate proactively when this risk disclosure was added.  My deepest apologies, and a good learning moment for us as we make future changes.\n\n7/ Finally, we of course offer a self-custodial wallet solution (Coinbase Wallet) for those who prefer to store their own crypto. Our goal is to make the best custodial and self-custodial solutions in crypto - each carry their own risks and benefits, and it's important...\n\n8/ ...that customers can choose the best solution for their needs. We'll continue working to improve customer protections in all our products across both categories.",

I did a test transfer from Kraken and it came over in 2-3 minutes. With Coin, I had a similar experience to what you are describing - a 72 hour delay. I was already previously Level 3 Verified under account limits. (this means you have sent them a certain type of government ID and they have approved you at the highest level of account validation). The messages I got about the delay communicated that I could bypass the delay by uploading my government issued ID. When I tried to do that, the upload functionality was not working (I tired from multiple browsers). I contacted support and they were very polite, well trained, and focused on my issue - but at the end of the day there were not equipped to address the root causes (either of the 72 hr delay, or of the browser upload not working). The net effect is I have a 72 hour delay for any transfer of crypto from Coinbase. What I communicated to them, is the result of this experience, is that I will now transfer 99% of my assets out of this account - deal with a 72 hour delay to get those funds - and then think anew about where I will keep my crypto assets. I always like to give people and organizations some benefit of the doubt, but I also can't help but wonder if this could be an engineered scenario to slow outbound assets from Coinbase. I would welcome input others on anything I might be overlooking here!",

There is nothing they can do about it Is this still the stance they are taking as a company? \n\nThere was talk of a class action lawsuit in the thread I found for people to have their funds returned. Is this happening? \n\nThis is not money I can afford to lose. It wasn't invested, that's why I was keeping it in USDT. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated at this point. \n\nThanks,   \nA",

Everyone talks about DEX but then complain about customer service lmao. Its good to keep your crypto in a private wallet but CB is not going out of business, just yesterday they had something like $100 million in revenue (which is about admittingly higher than usual). The volume traded since mid-march is way up. The posted loss comes from hiring (they have 3X the number of employees they had a year ago) and the drop in value of their bitcoin \"Other expenses  \nwere driven primarily by an increase in crypto asset impairment charges. Under GAAP,  \nwe are required to record impairment charges on our crypto assets held when the price  \nfalls below its cost basis.\" But in terms of their core business model they make 76% profit from transactions spend 17% on marketing and they spend almost $1.5 billion a year on technology/development and $750 million general administrative. This whole nonsense about what happens during a bankruptcy is not news lol. crypto not being FDIC insured is not news and only someone who knows literally nothing about digital currencies would think this is some kind of new development.",

Only that piece of paper can give you access to your crypto, so it's often a good idea to keep copies in 2-3 locations in case your house burns down.\n\nA hardware wallet is a small device like a USB dongle. Instead of your private hash you instead use the hardware wallet to generate a seed phrase. The idea being that not even you know your private key so you don't ever have to keep taking that piece of paper out every time you want to send crypto or validate transactions and potentially risk a hacker using something like a key logger to learn what you've typed in. With the hardware wallet you generate the seed phrase the first time you use the device, and you only ever have to use it again in future if the hardware wallet breaks (just get a new one and enter the seed phrase into it and your crypto will be restored).\n\nThere are also software wallets in the form of apps, desktop software, browser plugins etc which you should only ever use on a single machine that you use to send and receive crypto only, and keep the device turned off the rest of the time. Stupid people use software wallets on their primary devices that they also use for everything else, which makes it about as secure as a chocolate teapot.",

Users and their funds are the very bottom of the list if the company falls into financial problems, like it's shares market cap going from $400bn to $15bn in a matter of days.

It did, indeed, send me the e-mail and it was addressed to Michael Smith. That is 100% not my name.\n\nI immediately changed the password to the Coinbase account and to my e-mail. Now when I go to Coinbase to try to log in, I do the captcha and then get stuck in an infinite redirect loop.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on? Did Michael Smith type my e-mail by mistake? Has logging into the site given anyone access to my device? Any other action I can take? I assume I can\u2019t delete or deactivate the account (I\u2019m not interested in having one) without logging into it, but I\u2019m concerned the whole thing is scammy or virus-y.",

Was sent an email that said I can either KYC (again) or just wait a few days for the transfer to go through. I just waited since I already did the KYC and dont really like following links from emails. \n\nFast forward a week or so and my account is now blocked (no withdrawal or trading). Mind you this was in April before this big crash. I contact coinbase and kyc again and start to interact with their completely powerless online/phone customer service and they just tell me to wait for email reply. I have followed up probably 15 times with no response. \n\nWell today I got an email that tells me because I never responded the case is closed and the list of documents they want to reopen my account is insane. \n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n\"Please provide the following information by replying directly to this email and uploading the corresponding documents.  \n \n\n1. Please provide additional details around your current or previous occupation/any businesses you own/are involved in. Please also provide supporting documentation, eg. a payslip issued within the last 3 months or a letter from your Human Resources department confirming your employment.  \n 2. Please confirm the source of funds deposited into your Coinbase account and provide us with supporting documentation, (e.g. a payslip, statements from other exchanges, loan agreement, credit card statements, screenshot of transactions from an unhosted wallet).  \n 3. Please confirm the primary source(s) through which your overall wealth/net worth was generated and provide us with supporting documentation (e.g., a pay slip; brokerage/investment statement; home sale document, probate or conveyancing document, copy of Will, Grant of Probate, Gift Letter etc). If your source of wealth originated from investing in crypto or other investments, please provide additional supporting documentation showing the initial investments resulting in your wealth.  \n 4.

I provide them with everything they are asking and some but still no further progress. I feel like there is something going on behind close doors that the public isn\u2019t allow to know. Seems very shady cause how can so many people all that similiar issues of getting access to their bitcoin. My final thought, how could a publicly traded company go on for so long without an actual live person support. Like what kind of big company doesn\u2019t have that. It all speaks to how this company is being ran. They lock our money and soon could make off with it. So BS. \ud83d\udd95 coinbase",

You get an email from what appears to be your bank saying that want you to send them documentation which you had already submitted to a random upload link. \n\nWhat would you first response be? Obviously to go to your bank account online and see what the issue is and to follow any direction from the page itself. If you cant find anything there then you would call in and see what the issue is. Why would they ask for something they already requested? If there was really an issue surely someone can tell you what it is or there is some alert of flag that isnt just an email with a link to a portal not connected to the actual bank website.\n\nNow imagine you tried to call and all you got was a very basic customer service that said to wait for an email reply and there was nothing they could do and they have no information. So you email repeatedly trying to get answers with no response at all. You even do the KYC process as requested again.\n\nFinally you get a notice that says that your case is closed because you never contacted them and now you must enter even more information that isnt relevant that is very personal to the same random upload link. \n\nAnd all the while a huge run at the bank is happening while their share price is tanking.",

I contacted Coinbase support within minutes of the transactions, cancelled my card, called the next day to dispute the charges as soon as they posted. The thieves managed to charge my card for $56.21 twice, then $6.71 and finally $0.78. I only had $123 in the account, so as they kept charging they would drop the amount each time it declined until they were able to wipe out my account leaving only about $3 by the time I locked the card. All this happened within a half hour.\n\nSo far Coinbase resolved the $6.71 charge in my favor, though it has not yet posted to my balance. However I got this email regarding one of the $56.21 charges last night:\n\n\"We've completed our investigation of your dispute for the transaction of $56.21 USD made on 5/11/2022 at SORARE.COM.  \nUnfortunately, the chargeback was rejected by the network for the   \nfollowing reason \"Dispute is invalid under Dispute Condition 10.4 for a   \nVerified by Visa transaction\". As a result, we will be closing your   \nclaim.  \nRegards,  \nCoinbase Support\"\n\nThis is absolutely unacceptable. I will be filing complaints with the CFPB as another poster mentioned. In the meantime I have pulled all my assets off Coinbase and have moved to another platform.",

But you do have the right to find coinbase to recover your assets. If any customer mistakenly deposits a token that is not listed on Huobi, Huobi will assist in retrieving it, or even advance payment. In fact, you did deposit your assets into the coinbase address. I believe that as long as you keep looking for them to solve the problem, they will help you. After all, $35,000 is not a small sum. Good luck.'\n\nCoinbase simply is refusing to help us, while other exchanges like Huobi, but also Binance and [Gate.io](https://Gate.io) do help in these cases.... we should never give up, these are OUR tokens.",

Eventually told me the algorithm was out of their hands and that I would need to \"use my account\" and it would auto adjust my deposits again, but otherwise they would do nothing for me. Keep in mind my deposit limit went from like 10 or 25K daily (forget) to $250 and my account is empty. I pretty much told them they forced my hand and I have no choice to go with their competitor - not a threat, but there is really no other choice. Gemini seems to do $10K instant ACH with no games, so I recommend everyone should at least check them out (if someone has an idea of a US exchange w/ better ACH limits let me know)",

My bank ach deposit is lowered, then ACH is locked/ placed on hold (how can I pay coinbase if they locked me sheezes)...

I don't want to take the risk of messing with it and having it revert again. For now, I'm still a CB client, but I think you guys need to be WAY more transparent about how this works, as it screwed me over. At minimum, if you are gonna shrink the deposit limit... NOTIFY..in advance. This isn't a hard customer service thing - this is easy stuff. Whether you should be dynamic shrinking/growing so much is another story, but if you are going to do it, you need to at least be notifying excessively via every comm method you have for that client.\n\nBTW: I think I'm starting to figure the basics of your algorithm out (big withdraw --> shrink deposit limit, big deposit --> increase deposit limit or something like that). I had been maxing out my $250/day last two days and I suspect that is what prompted the big jump? who knows...",

Then use $25k BTC of which Swap to UST.\n\nBlackrock and Citadel contacted Do Kwan and asked to buy UST at a discount of a large amount of BTC.\n\nAnd so Do Kwan agreed to buy back that amount of BTC at a higher price than the market price, which is to sell at a discount of the amount of UST, which dilutes the UST's capitalization.\n\nRight after that, the 2 funds released all of btc and ust because those 2 funds knew that in Anchor Protocol, they were Staking a lot of UST customers with 20% APY. If generating enough Panic Sell for UST to lose its peg, it would create a total crisis because UST's capitalization at that time was larger than the entire amount of counterpart assets including LUNA and BTC as well as many other tokens.\n\nThis incident triggered the Anchor Protocol which forced the release of a lot of Luna tokens to pull the peg for UST back to 1$, and the snowball started to appear, the more UST fell => the more LUNA fell => the collateral value for UST fell further => Luna Foundation Group (LFG) had to sell a large amount of BTC mortgage to support BUY and BURN UST.\n\nFrom there, it caused selling pressure on the whole market when BTC dropped => 2 funds bought back the borrowed amount of BTC at a low price and made a big profit.\n\nThe question is at what price will these 2 funds close a short order at $100k BTC???\n\n**Did the ancestor Do Kwan strangle himself to death?**",

That means it just shows you your coins as they are *on the blockchain*. Whatever native blockchain the coin is on.\n\nI don't use CW, not would I. I don't trust it to respect my privacy. (The app can still phone home with analytics, etc.) But I did install it a while back just to check it out. **You can unlock your private keys with the seed phrase**. Your keys, your coins.\n\nThe point is, to answer your question: **Your coins are perfectly safe on CW if coinbase.com goes under**.\n\n(Now if your argument is something like, \"How do you know that Coinbase hasn't programmed in a nuclear option to transfer your coins to them?\" To which I'd say, \"Well tinfoil hat conspiracy idiot, that would be outright theft, a federal offense, and for most coins easily traceable.

My account access was restored.\n\nSince this time, my account has remained \u201crestricted.\u201d \nI am unable to make payments on my BTC backed loan and I am unable to sell or buy crypto.\nI have submitted all requested documents for identify verification - including:\n- California Drivers license \n- Photo of marriage certificate and birth certificate showing name change \n\nI SEEM TO BE STUCK IN SOME HORRIBLE LOOP WITH YOUR SUPPORT TEAM WHERE THEY  ARE EITHER NOT READING OR CANNOT ACCESS MY CASE HISTORY.\n\nI have not received any clear instructions regarding what else may be needed to clear this case. I am a a loss at this point and meanwhile have experienced significant losses despite repeated attempts to sell my crypto. This is absolutely unacceptable. I had a high degree of trust in Coinbase before this experience and I am completely aghast at what is happening now. \n\nYour phone support teams have NO ability to escalate calls to a live person with higher abilities to respond to issues outside of the prescribed script. \n\nI am literally stuck in a loop and watching my life savings erode.\n\nPLEASE HELP ME!",
