I just waited since I already did the KYC and dont really like following links from emails. \n\nFast forward a week or so and my account is now blocked (no withdrawal or trading). Mind you this was in April before this big crash. I contact coinbase and kyc again and start to interact with their completely powerless online/phone customer service and they just tell me to wait for email reply. I have followed up probably 15 times with no response. \n\nWell today I got an email that tells me because I never responded the case is closed and the list of documents they want to reopen my account is insane. \n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n\"Please provide the following information by replying directly to this email and uploading the corresponding documents.  \n \n\n1. Please provide additional details around your current or previous occupation/any businesses you own/are involved in. Please also provide supporting documentation, eg. a payslip issued within the last 3 months or a letter from your Human Resources department confirming your employment.  \n 2. Please confirm the source of funds deposited into your Coinbase account and provide us with supporting documentation, (e.g. a payslip, statements from other exchanges, loan agreement, credit card statements, screenshot of transactions from an unhosted wallet).  \n 3. Please confirm the primary source(s) through which your overall wealth/net worth was generated and provide us with supporting documentation (e.g., a pay slip; brokerage/investment statement; home sale document, probate or conveyancing document, copy of Will, Grant of Probate, Gift Letter etc). If your source of wealth originated from investing in crypto or other investments, please provide additional supporting documentation showing the initial investments resulting in your wealth.  \n 4. Please provide us with 12 months worth of bank statements, issued within the last 13 months.\"\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~  \n   \n  This is all just insane and I have quite a substantial amount of money trapped inside and I have found no way to actually speak to anyone that has any power to do anything.

The biggest risk is an inability to service debt. \n\nA quick look at their financial statements shows they had revenues of over $1 billion but only owed $22m in interest. They posted a $430m loss in Q1 but they also had a non-recurring expense on R&D of $600m for their (really stupid) NFT platform. \n\nThey aren\u2019t becoming insolvent and looking at their balance sheet shows they\u2019re able to cover their liabilities (people\u2019s deposits). Unless you\u2019re accusing them of fabricating their financial statements (a pretty serious crime for a public company), they\u2019re very far from insolvency.",

My account access was restored.\n\nSince this time, my account has remained \u201crestricted.\u201d \nI am unable to make payments on my BTC backed loan and I am unable to sell or buy crypto.\nI have submitted all requested documents for identify verification - including:\n- California Drivers license \n- Photo of marriage certificate and birth certificate showing name change \n\nI SEEM TO BE STUCK IN SOME HORRIBLE LOOP WITH YOUR SUPPORT TEAM WHERE THEY  ARE EITHER NOT READING OR CANNOT ACCESS MY CASE HISTORY.\n\nI have not received any clear instructions regarding what else may be needed to clear this case. I am a a loss at this point and meanwhile have experienced significant losses despite repeated attempts to sell my crypto. This is absolutely unacceptable. I had a high degree of trust in Coinbase before this experience and I am completely aghast at what is happening now. \n\nYour phone support teams have NO ability to escalate calls to a live person with higher abilities to respond to issues outside of the prescribed script. \n\nI am literally stuck in a loop and watching my life savings erode.\n\nPLEASE HELP ME!",

Tl;dr: Your funds are safe at Coinbase, just as they\u2019ve always been.\n\n2/ We have no risk of bankruptcy, however we included a new risk factor based on an SEC requirement called SAB 121, which is a newly required disclosure for public companies that hold crypto assets for third parties.  https://www.sec.gov/oca/staff-accounting-bulletin-121\n\n3/ We believe our Prime and Custody customers have strong legal protections in their terms of service that protects their assets, even in a black swan event like this.\n\n4/ For our retail customers, we\u2019re taking further steps to update our user terms such that we offer the same protections to those customers in a black swan event. We should have had these in place previously, so let me apologize for that.\n\n5/ This disclosure makes sense in that these legal protections have not been tested in court for crypto assets specifically, and it is possible, however unlikely, that a court would decide to consider customer assets as part of the company in bankruptcy proceedings...\n\n6/ We should have updated our retail terms sooner, and we didn't communicate proactively when this risk disclosure was added.  My deepest apologies, and a good learning moment for us as we make future changes.\n\n7/ Finally, we of course offer a self-custodial wallet solution (Coinbase Wallet) for those who prefer to store their own crypto. Our goal is to make the best custodial and self-custodial solutions in crypto - each carry their own risks and benefits, and it's important...\n\n8/ ...that customers can choose the best solution for their needs. We'll continue working to improve customer protections in all our products across both categories.",

            "selftext": "Two whales, BlackRock and Citadel, borrowed $100k in BTC from Gemini exchange (in the loan book notice). Then use $25k BTC of which Swap to UST.\n\nBlackrock and Citadel contacted Do Kwan and asked to buy UST at a discount of a large amount of BTC.\n\nAnd so Do Kwan agreed to buy back that amount of BTC at a higher price than the market price, which is to sell at a discount of the amount of UST, which dilutes the UST's capitalization.\n\nRight after that, the 2 funds released all of btc and ust because those 2 funds knew that in Anchor Protocol, they were Staking a lot of UST customers with 20% APY. If generating enough Panic Sell for UST to lose its peg, it would create a total crisis because UST's capitalization at that time was larger than the entire amount of counterpart assets including LUNA and BTC as well as many other tokens.\n\nThis incident triggered the Anchor Protocol which forced the release of a lot of Luna tokens to pull the peg for UST back to 1$, and the snowball started to appear, the more UST fell => the more LUNA fell => the collateral value for UST fell further => Luna Foundation Group (LFG) had to sell a large amount of BTC mortgage to support BUY and BURN UST.\n\nFrom there, it caused selling pressure on the whole market when BTC dropped => 2 funds bought back the borrowed amount of BTC at a low price and made a big profit.\n\nThe question is at what price will these 2 funds close a short order at $100k BTC???\n\n**Did the ancestor Do Kwan strangle himself to death?**",
