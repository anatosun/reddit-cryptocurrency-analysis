There is nothing they can do about it Is this still the stance they are taking as a company? \n\nThere was talk of a class action lawsuit in the thread I found for people to have their funds returned. Is this happening? \n\nThis is not money I can afford to lose. It wasn't invested, that's why I was keeping it in USDT. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated at this point. \n\nThanks,   \nA",

Just because it's price is pegged to the dollar doesn't mean it carries any less risk than any other coin. \n\n You've put more than you can afford to lose into a crypto that temporarily failed, and now you've lost it all through a combination of those temp issues with the crypto, and then user error.

The biggest risk is an inability to service debt. \n\nA quick look at their financial statements shows they had revenues of over $1 billion but only owed $22m in interest. They posted a $430m loss in Q1 but they also had a non-recurring expense on R&D of $600m for their (really stupid) NFT platform. \n\nThey aren\u2019t becoming insolvent and looking at their balance sheet shows they\u2019re able to cover their liabilities (people\u2019s deposits).

The person said they would work with me over the phone and authorize everything if I do the KYC.\n\nI did my best - we got disconnected - no call back.\n\nI call customer service and try again.  I'm told someone will call me back - so far 1 hour no call back.\n\nThis is suspicious - deposit coins, then email saying must do KYC.\n\nHELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nReaders - contact Coinbase and tell them you want to do your NEW KYC before having your trading account suspended.",

Tl;dr: Your funds are safe at Coinbase, just as they\u2019ve always been.\n\n2/ We have no risk of bankruptcy, however we included a new risk factor based on an SEC requirement called SAB 121, which is a newly required disclosure for public companies that hold crypto assets for third parties.  https://www.sec.gov/oca/staff-accounting-bulletin-121\n\n3/ We believe our Prime and Custody customers have strong legal protections in their terms of service that protects their assets, even in a black swan event like this.\n\n4/ For our retail customers, we\u2019re taking further steps to update our user terms such that we offer the same protections to those customers in a black swan event. We should have had these in place previously, so let me apologize for that.\n\n5/ This disclosure makes sense in that these legal protections have not been tested in court for crypto assets specifically, and it is possible, however unlikely, that a court would decide to consider customer assets as part of the company in bankruptcy proceedings...\n\n6/ We should have updated our retail terms sooner, and we didn't communicate proactively when this risk disclosure was added.  My deepest apologies, and a good learning moment for us as we make future changes.\n\n7/ Finally, we of course offer a self-custodial wallet solution (Coinbase Wallet) for those who prefer to store their own crypto. Our goal is to make the best custodial and self-custodial solutions in crypto - each carry their own risks and benefits, and it's important...\n\n8/ ...that customers can choose the best solution for their needs. We'll continue working to improve customer protections in all our products across both categories.",

Then use $25k BTC of which Swap to UST.\n\nBlackrock and Citadel contacted Do Kwan and asked to buy UST at a discount of a large amount of BTC.\n\nAnd so Do Kwan agreed to buy back that amount of BTC at a higher price than the market price, which is to sell at a discount of the amount of UST, which dilutes the UST's capitalization.\n\nRight after that, the 2 funds released all of btc and ust because those 2 funds knew that in Anchor Protocol, they were Staking a lot of UST customers with 20% APY. If generating enough Panic Sell for UST to lose its peg, it would create a total crisis because UST's capitalization at that time was larger than the entire amount of counterpart assets including LUNA and BTC as well as many other tokens.\n\nThis incident triggered the Anchor Protocol which forced the release of a lot of Luna tokens to pull the peg for UST back to 1$, and the snowball started to appear, the more UST fell => the more LUNA fell => the collateral value for UST fell further => Luna Foundation Group (LFG) had to sell a large amount of BTC mortgage to support BUY and BURN UST.\n\nFrom there, it caused selling pressure on the whole market when BTC dropped => 2 funds bought back the borrowed amount of BTC at a low price and made a big profit.\n\nThe question is at what price will these 2 funds close a short order at $100k BTC???\n\n**Did the ancestor Do Kwan strangle himself to death?**",

Eventually told me the algorithm was out of their hands and that I would need to \"use my account\" and it would auto adjust my deposits again, but otherwise they would do nothing for me. Keep in mind my deposit limit went from like 10 or 25K daily (forget) to $250 and my account is empty. I pretty much told them they forced my hand and I have no choice to go with their competitor - not a threat, but there is really no other choice. Gemini seems to do $10K instant ACH with no games, so I recommend everyone should at least check them out (if someone has an idea of a US exchange w/ better ACH limits let me know)",

My bank ach deposit is lowered, then ACH is locked/ placed on hold (how can I pay coinbase if they locked me sheezes)...

For now, I'm still a CB client, but I think you guys need to be WAY more transparent about how this works, as it screwed me over. At minimum, if you are gonna shrink the deposit limit... NOTIFY..in advance. This isn't a hard customer service thing - this is easy stuff. Whether you should be dynamic shrinking/growing so much is another story, but if you are going to do it, you need to at least be notifying excessively via every comm method you have for that client.\n\nBTW: I think I'm starting to figure the basics of your algorithm out (big withdraw --> shrink deposit limit, big deposit --> increase deposit limit or something like that). I had been maxing out my $250/day last two days and I suspect that is what prompted the big jump? who knows...",
