Having said that, DeFi is drastically different from the traditional way of financial communication we know.\n\nHere\u2019s how DeFi projects are making a difference in the traditional banking industry.\n\nCentralized Finance\n\nMoney has been the means of human exchange for centuries, with the first ever known currency - the Mesopotamian shekel - being around 5,000 years old. This is also the time when the concept behind centralized finance was conceived.\n\nIn centralized finance, the control over money is appointed to financial institutions, e.g. banks, which play the role of middlemen and have an overlapping goal of earning a profit (hence, they like to charge fees).\n\nWith the introduction of the first cryptocurrency - [Bitcoin](https://getblock.io/dedicated-nodes/btc/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) \\- things have changed. According to some experts, Bitcoin could become the new, most effective option for storing value, as it does not require a trusted third party to perform operations. Besides, it has purchasing power, liquidity and authority.\n\nAt the same time, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges entered the market. Binance, Coinbase, Kraken still remain one of the most important transacting vehicles for millions of crypto holders around the world.\n\nDecentralized Finance\n\nDecentralized Finance came in a bit later. With DeFi, it is possible to conduct transactions with no middlemen involved. As DeFi projects run on blockchain technology, they use [consensus mechanisms](https://getblock.io/blog/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-whats-the-difference/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) to verify the data on the network. DeFi provides all kinds of transparent, fast and inexpensive financial services. Smart contracts, supported by blockchain technology, contain the rules of operation written in the form of a traceable code. Any decentralized application offering financial services could be considered a DeFi project.\n\nN.B.
