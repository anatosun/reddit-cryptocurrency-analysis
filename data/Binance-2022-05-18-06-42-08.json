Please understand our intention, and cooperate with us by starting a chat with our [official support](https://www.binance.com/en/chat?ref=JLI1VBLA&utm_source=BinanceReddit&utm_medium=GlobalSocial&utm_campaign=GlobalSocial) for us to be able to assist you. Please do note any support requests outside of this thread will not be attended to, thanks for understanding.\n\n[Click here for official Binance support.](https://www.binance.com/en/chat?ref=JLI1VBLA&utm_source=BinanceReddit&utm_medium=GlobalSocial&utm_campaign=GlobalSocial) *Make sure you login and* ***provide your email or phone number,*** *select your issue from the options, if your issue wasn\u2019t answered click* ***\u2018unresolved\u2019*** *and type* ***\u2018human\u2019*** *to interact with our live support team, then click* ***\u2018okay\u2019*** *to proceed.*\n\n*Do not hesitate to help your fellow Binancians as long as their inquiry is a general one, however attempting to engage in sensitive matters, or providing wrong information will lead to the comment being removed.*\n\n\\-----------------------------------\n\n**How to post about your case**\n\nPlease follow this format:\n\n1. Comment on this thread with your case ID (please ensure your case ID is still valid before posting)\n2. Provide a description of your issue (we\u2019ve included a few common problems below)\n\nIf your case gets resolved, please delete your comment. Or, at least update it to say resolved. This will help users that still need help get the attention they need. Thank you!\n\n***Please note:*** *We can\u2019t help you unless you provide us with a valid case ID. Users with Binance US cases will have to refer to* [*r/BinanceUS*](https://www.reddit.com/r/BinanceUS/)\n\n[**To get a case ID you must start a live chat with support.** Click here, select \u2018unsolved\u2019 and type \u2018human\u2019 to join the live CS queue.](https://www.binance.com/en/chat?ref=JLI1VBLA&utm_source=BinanceReddit&utm_medium=GlobalSocial&utm_campaign=GlobalSocial) The case ID will be shown far left of the top bar - alternatively, you can see your case ID in the email or text you receive upon initiating the chat.\n\n\\-----------------------------------\n\n**Common problems & solutions**\n\n**1. Crypto withdrawal suspended**\n\n\u25cf You receive a message saying \u2018withdrawal suspended due to risk control\u2019 and have been trying to unlock your account.\n\n\u25cf Don\u2019t worry, your funds are SAFU. Our agents will try their best to help unlock the withdrawal - please coordinate with our team and provide relevant information when prompted to do so.\n\n\u25cf Withdrawal Risk can be triggered by a number of reasons. Risk control is extremely important. Please note that we can only help you if we deem your case to be legitimate, if you have attempted to hack an account and request for unsuspension, you will be unsuccessful as we have processes in place to prevent this.\n\nOur team works extremely hard to resolve these issues as soon as possible and some cases can take time to resolve but please keep in mind the reason for this is to ensure you, our users, are safe.\n\n**Cases replied by our mods are already in the escalation process. A longer wait after escalation = our team is working hard at investigating the issue.** If there are any updates to the case, our agents will reply to you directly in the chat.\n\nPlease refrain from leaving multiple messages in this thread if your case has already been escalated.\n\n**2. Security issues**\n\n\u25cf Report hacked accounts and funds.\n\n\u25cf Difficulty to reset 2FA and gain access to your account.\n\n**3. Fiat deposit & withdrawal**\n\n\u25cf Fiat (not crypto) is taking longer than expected to arrive in your bank / Binance account.\n\n\u25cf Involves intermediaries such as bank transfers or buying crypto with credit/debit cards.\n\n\u25cf *Note: It can take up to several working days for the money to be credited to your accounts.* [You can find more FAQ here](https://twitter.com/BinanceHelpDesk/status/1391776637071478787)\n\n**4. US persons accessing old Binance.com accounts for offboarding & withdrawal of funds**\n\n\u25cf Your funds are SAFU. If you experience issues with withdrawing remaining funds, follow the above steps to get to our live chat queue - our agents will try our best to assist you with the offboarding.\n\n**5. Trading system and other account issues**\n\n\u25cf Spot, margin & futures trading\n\n\u25cf P2P disputes\n\n\u25cf Binance Visa Card transactions\n\n\u25cf Unable to complete KYC\n\n\u25cf Any other issues\n\n**Please follow the format stated above, your case cannot be escalated if you do not follow this process and your comment may be removed. Following the format helps us classify and identify the issues, escalate them to our relevant departments and get everyone\u2019s problems resolved.** ***Spamming the feed is unfair to other users and will result in a ban.***\n\nThank you!",

I tried to get an explanation of what was going on, and I got this insane answer:  \n\n\n>Dear user, We understand your frustration. However, we are not in the position to provide any additional details, except those that had been already provided in the previous message - your account has been flagged due to either due to an internal risk assessment or a geographic restriction and as a result, we are unable to serve you further in accordance with our Terms of Use. As I said before, as soon as I have an answer regarding the funds that you have in Earn, I will let you know. Thank you.  \n\n\nWhen asking how could I get further information, I just got this as a reply:\n\n>Dear user, No one will be able to give you additional details or reasoning. What can be said has already been shared with you.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is mind blowing. But not in a good way. \n\nThe worst thing, I was in the crypto event because we're developing a crytpo project on the BSC.\n\nCould anyone give me some help?",

I red many scary comments accross reddit, that people cant unfreeze accounts for month.\n\nFor me it took just two days, special shoutout to Binance Zendesk support Michael. He was responding to my SOW updates after 30 mins only.\n\nAlso want to tell to everyone else, if your account gets frozen, dont be scared and dont read those scary stories. Binance has to do it because of criminals that were using Binance previously for their dirty things.\n\nSource Of Wealth report comes in google doc to your email. And all they want to know, that you are indeed real person, that has nothing to hide. If its your own hard earned crypto via different chains, you are 100% fine, just cooperate with support. This way they try to catch money laundering operations, hackers or simply stolen crypto.\n\nGood luck everyone",
