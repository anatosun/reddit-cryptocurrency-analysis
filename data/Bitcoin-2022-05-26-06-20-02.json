You can lock up bitcoins in the main chain in such a way that new tokens are generated in the sidechain, you can move them around in the sidechain and then they can be recovered in the main chain.\n\nLightning Network is a protocol that allows you to send off-chain bitcoins between participating nodes through payment channels. Two nodes create a channel by committing a certain amount of bitcoins, and then the balance in this channel can move from one side to the other without touching the main chain. Payments can traverse multiple channels until the destination. When a channel is closed the bitcoins committed are distributed to the nodes.",

At this moment only the very top nodes are generating real profits, the rest doesn't even cover the cost of running the node. But at least it's fun.\n\nYou should put an amount that you are more or less comfortable in losing. I'm not saying you will lose it, but at least it's a metric that you can use to decide. For example, if you lose $200, do you go nuts and start having suicidal thoughts? If so then repeat the exercise with a lower amount. If instead you are more like *\"meh it's a pain but at least I learned something\"* then repeat the exercise with a higher amount. You will soon find the sweet spot.",

As i never ran a node LN before maybe there is an amount of btc \"required\" as a standar to put in. Not sure of this. This is my question. Like, is recommended to put more than ..... etc?\n\nI know the profits can be very minimum, but just wanted to do it for fun, help the community and to learn more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You can lose your funds every time you manipulate bitcoins, so yeah.
