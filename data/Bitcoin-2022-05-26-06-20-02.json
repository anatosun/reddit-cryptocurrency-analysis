Two nodes create a channel by committing a certain amount of bitcoins, and then the balance in this channel can move from one side to the other without touching the main chain.

At this moment only the very top nodes are generating real profits, the rest doesn't even cover the cost of running the node. But at least it's fun.\n\nYou should put an amount that you are more or less comfortable in losing. I'm not saying you will lose it, but at least it's a metric that you can use to decide. For example, if you lose $200, do you go nuts and start having suicidal thoughts? If so then repeat the exercise with a lower amount. If instead you are more like *\"meh it's a pain but at least I learned something\"* then repeat the exercise with a higher amount. You will soon find the sweet spot.",

This is my question. Like, is recommended to put more than ..... etc?\n\nThere is no such minimum as far as I know. Each node sets the minimum (and maximum) channel size that they accept, but in most cases the minimum is quite small so this is normally not a limitation. But you will want to open multiple channels so plan accordingly.\n\n>I know the basics of security when transact with btc. Now, when setting up the node, what can make me loss my funds? So i can avoid this risks...Thx for reply\n\nWith LND (the only software I've used so far) it's a bit hard to lose funds (excluding obvious mistakes like erasing your wallet or things like that). I think there are two main LN-only errors that may be catastrophic:\n\n1. **Restoring a channel state from an old backup.** Both ends of a channel must agree on the balance, so if you restore an old channel state the other party will think you are trying to cheat and will steal all your funds from that channel.\n2. **Keeping your node offline for extended periods while channels are open.** Normally if the other party tries to steal your funds your node will punish it. But if your node is offline it can't do it, so it's good to open your node at least once during the punishment window (normally \\~2 weeks). But of course an offline node cannot route payments so it's pointless to build an LN node and keep it offline.\n\nIt would be good if you read the [disaster recovery guide](https://docs.lightning.engineering/lightning-network-tools/lnd/disaster-recovery) so you understand the procedure.",
