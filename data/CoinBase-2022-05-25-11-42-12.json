The newly launched coinbase legal support telegram team dedicated to fraud/scam and hack victims was helpful in my colleague\u2019s case.  The purpose of the group is to help reduce fraud, demystify counterparty risk, and help flag AML risks with sophisticated risk scores and alerts. Glad this company is finally taking steps .",
