Recommendations are highly welcome.\n\nIn short words, I'd like to open a business, with staking pools from proven 3rd parties integrated on my web. I am not looking for developers or similar to create such, simply as I don't have any smartcontract / pool coding knowledge and can't judge whether they are trustable or not. I want to offer services to clients, based on good names in the crypto era.\n\nThanks for any information provided.",

There was a NFT project that I follow requesting EOS to be matched, pooled, and used to form a grant service.\n\nI thought I'd toss an EOS, but I had under a partial. I thought I'd swap ETH in Wombat, so I checked my wallet via Wombat, and saw that my ETH balance was 0.\n\nI knew this was incorrect because I'd had ~$16 ETH for some time.\n\nHere is the wallet on Etherscan. The last transaction occurred at a time I was sleeping. This transaction effectively drained the wallet to exactly 0 ETH (ignore the MNE, please):\n\n[0x1dfAb93f39aBf47dfcEAfD182Fb613EB16d86a24](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1dfab93f39abf47dfceafd182fb613eb16d86a24)\n\nThis is my most fleshed out wallet regarding networks.\n\nCurrently most of my funds are on KuCoin, Gemini, and Cake Defi.  Only 2 days ago, I was investigating staking Cake out of my own wallet as opposed to using Cake Defi platform.  I am glad I did not fully comprehend the procedure--heck, not even a little.\n\nThis was my first wallet.  It has been a fundamental part of what little I truly understand about crypto.\n\nNow for a stupid question: What do I do with the wallet?",

Obviously no one would use a bank like that, and if your money was stolen you wouldn't say a crime has been committed as the bank stated that it might happen.\n\nI'm interested to hear people's thoughts as well as the legalities of what actually went down!\n\nThanks!",

It's more like a flaw in the entire system, that invalidated specific clauses in many contracts. Funds are still stolen today because of this issue combined with contracts that aren't carefully written to mitigate it.\n\nThe space as a whole is more dangerous, and writing smart contacts is far more difficult because of this and similar flaws.",

The site you linked to says that the amount of eth decreasing each year is greater than the newly minted eth which creates a net decrease each year which in turn causes negative inflation. Three big questions arise from this:\n\n1. Is this decreasing inflation built into ethereum's algorithm?\n2. If yes, can this algorithm be changed, or is eth sufficiently decentralized to prevent the algorithm from changing.\n3. If the eth supply is decreasing, wont we end up with zero eth in the future?",

                    "response": "You are sort of correct regarding the \"fixed\" amount per year. The newly minted \"block reward\" is 2 ETH per block, so - although the number of blocks is not exactly fixed per year - you get roughly 4,5% when you put that in relation to all ETH currently in existence.\n\nBut (as others have noted):\n\n\\- you have the fee burn mechanism which is variable and lowers inflation\n\n\\- the block rewards were changed in the past, although not automatically as Bitcoin does it\n\n\\- this whole thing will change completely with Proof-of-Stake, [ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money) is a very good address to see the simulated effects\n\n\\- if you think about it, Bitcoin is technically also inflationary for the next 100+ years (=any relevant timespan), although the decreasing inflation never lets BTS exceed the mythical 21 millions. As of today, new supply and demand still affect BTC price! (someone has to buy 900 BTC at market price each and every day)\n\nSo, regarding Ethereum, do not get mad over that inflation thing. Short term, this will happen: Supply will grow a bit until the switch to PoS in a few months (July or August maybe?).\n\nThen, all of a sudden, supply will be zero as no new block rewards will be minted and all PoS rewards remain locked. The functionality to withdraw stakes and staking rewards is going to be added one release later (Shanghai release).\n\nTechnically, this means that the circulating ETH will decrease through burn (and probably more people staking and locking ETH). Then, at the Shanghai release (which I think will happen at least 6 months after the Merge), a lot of ETH (\\~1 million+) might rush into the market as the accumulated staking rewards since 12/2020 become unlocked.\n\nAfter that, we will have to see how everything plays out. Supply WILL be a lot lower than now. It could be that ETH becomes slightly deflationary or slightly inflationary, but I think in any case it will remain somewhere near zero. So despite all marketing that says otherwise, basically ETH will stop being inflationary like a hundred years before BTC.",
