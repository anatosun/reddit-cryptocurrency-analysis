We don't know the amount of coins on each side, but we do know the **probabilities** of a certain amount of liquidity being on one side of the channel, and that is what the algorithm uses to calculate the probability along the route.\n\nAs far as I understood the story, he realized that once you have those probabilities, it essentially becomes an optimization problem. He then figured out that there is already a solution known for that problem, so he used it to implement the new routing algorithm.\n\nWas at a presentation of it last summer, and that are my vague recollection of it. There was a lot of beer flowing, so may have gotten some details wrong. But I think he also wrote some stuff about it.",

This transaction however took 81 seconds to complete because only 92 of the 137 individual transactions made it on the first attempt. Transactions that fail on the first go get resent until they reach their destination and ultimately combine into the final transaction amount.\n\n81 seconds is a lot better than 10 minutes on the main chain for final settlement. As lightning grows this time will reduce and soon people will be able to send $100k worth of sats in one transaction and get instant settlement.\n\nThis is proof that it works, it only gets better from here.",

Definitely could be done cheaper on chain, but still pretty damn cheap for that size of a transaction. \n\nThis is much bigger than you think. LN currently relies a lot on higher fee mega-routers to have the liquidity available even for smaller payments. I see payments fail to route through my smaller low-fee node every day in the 500k-1m sat range. If payments are able to split up and find multiple smaller cheaper routes it will reduce fees for the payment and reduce our reliance on these larger centralized hubs. They may even have to consider bringing their fees down in order to compete.",

First, you'll get raped on fees, second, it takes forever to settle. One use case is using lightning for remittances. It's a game changer.\n\nThen you introduce things like Taro, that allow you to send other digital assets over lightning. Dollars will probably be around for a long time to come, but with Taro, digital dollars could be sent anywhere in the world over lightning rails.\n\nYou can't go from zero adoption to a full global circular economy overnight.

What a joke!\"\n\nThe only joke is trolls like you who think that lightning should go from incubation to mass global adoption and complete, robust technical implementations overnight, and if it doesn't, it's a joke and a failure.\n\nIf you don't understand what this experiment is and you're criticizing it, I'm guessing you havent done any research on the topic and have no idea what is being proven out. And I'm not going to waste my breath trying to spell it out for you.\n\nDYOR or STFU and GTFO",
