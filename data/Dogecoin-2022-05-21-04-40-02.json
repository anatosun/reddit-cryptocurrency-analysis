I was like wow, one day I'm going to become a millionaire, and I sat in my room and had to let it settle in my soul, or something like that.\n\nThen Joe Biden cranked up the prettiness of the Treasury yields. I started getting a ton of missed calls.. and they weren't from my ex!\n\nEdit: I will probably never do margin again. Like losing my first game of blackjack, I'll take it as luck that my first experiences with gambling and margins were terrible ones.",

I think even $3-$5 would be to agree that there is some coming catalyst that would spur individuals, whales, and companies into buying large amounts of doge, like what we see with Ethereum and Bitcoin and some other popular high-use coins.\n\nWhile doge has made some big strides in user adoption it's still waiting for something larger. Let's be honest, a lot of the hype has just been its connection to Elon and tweets from a few other celebrities.\n\nIf doge had some large-scale uses that depended on it we could see the price move much higher. Maybe others can chime in about roadmaps and future plans for business and infrastructure but I'm not aware of any big market movers coming for doge.",
