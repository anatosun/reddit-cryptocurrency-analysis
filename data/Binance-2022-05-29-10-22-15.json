Shame on me, but I did not check if the name on the transfer matched the name of the buyer. I received the money, released the crpyto, but a few days later, the money got frozen in my bank account. I believe the person who sent the transfer is pretending his bank account got stolen and is requesting the transfers be cancelled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny chance someone is knowledgeable on the scam and knows what I can do to improve the chances of unfreezing the money? Or else tell me that I most likely lost my money?",
