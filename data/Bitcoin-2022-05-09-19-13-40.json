            "subreddit": "Bitcoin",
            "selftext": "I authored this post a few weeks back discussing why changing the 21M hard cap is completely irrelevant in the future. The reason for that is because assuming bitcoin successfully becomes the honest transparent base layer that we need so desperately to replace the dishonest fiat/debt base layer--which nothing built over can ever achieve honesty--then changing the 21M hard cap would simply cause everything outside the money (products, services, credit markets) to adjust to the new block subsidy and BTC float. Thusly, the incentive to change it doesn't exist. This was really more of a refutation of FUD *(But the limit can be changed!)* and thought experiment than it was any probability.\n\nI based this on economics 101, and more closely, on bitcoin mining. If for example, bitcoin spiked to $100k tomorrow, what would happen? Would an ASIC stay at the price it is today, which is about $10k for an S19j? No. It would increase roughly by whatever the BTC price increase is and then price itself with the next difficulty adjustment and current hashpower, along with the price entropy associated with an always approaching halving. I've noticed that when you include this stuff, mining has actually consistently beaten my spot BTC buys over the long run by a few percent.\n\nSo this all figures into my $400k price call. If you got a $100k spike tomorrow, would BTC maintain itself there? Absolutely not, because that would be at odds with everything rational to do with money. Why? Because efficient miners would be sitting there making $80k per BTC. Their BTC stockpiles would be worth a tremendous amount. ASIC owners would be sitting there with insane hardware appreciation. What do you think happens here? Same thing that eventually happens in every commodity market over time--the gap would get closed, arbitraged, miners would do huge share offerings, even I'd sell my S19's, the difficulty adjustment would rocket, every student with a laptop would be syphoning their dorm and library's free electricity to mine. The price would drawdown, because we are very early in BTC's monetization phase.\n\nBut before you freak out, here's what bears always forget:\n\nThere are two sides to that. This holds true for not just the move up, but the move down as well. So when you have baseload energy prices along the lines of *$8 per cubic foot* or *$110 per barrel*, you have hashpower increasing relentlessly, difficulty adjustments going up, constrained supply chains and miners HODLing, how long can the price stay depressed? Not long. That would be at odds with everything rational to do with money.\n\nLook at the major miners. Are they selling? Nope. Decreasing their hashpower. Nope. Read their 10k's. u/Riotblockchain is active on this sub and they just announced in a post last week a 1GW expansion, literally at the same moment the press dropped elsewhere. Here's all the US majors plans 2022:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rgxttjcv6dy81.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=193bcf52457e106096140dccb78ea17488189685\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THAT. IS. JAW-DROPPING.** This to me says a 10x is likely the peak which also happens to be about gold's market capitalization give or take. Will it hold? Absolutely not, probably a drawdown of 50%-60% like we see currently. Bitcoin doesn't target a stable price, it targets a variable price. It can control the supply and issuance, then the market determines what the price is. That's what a free market looks like. Bitcoin is in the long, difficult, and organic process of absorbing the world's trust (and thus its value). When it's absorbed enough, the confidence curve (and thus its volatility) will flatten. Many projects think they can magically skip this step. There's only one crypto category that can: stablecoins. That's why nothing inside altcoin protocols have ever established themselves as money, except stablecoins. Which is why 85% of all altcoin volume is from stablecoins--a percentage that is growing monthly. You ever look at the graph of stablecoin growth? At this rate it'll be bitcoin at #1 and stablecoins making up the next 4 spots in 5 years. If you add bitcoin's mkt cap dominance with the mkt caps of stablecoins, you get 74%. But there are 15,000 altcoins... Talk about an example of *Gresham's Law.* This is why you don't touch anything but bitcoin, because here's another prediction:\n\nFiat trouble is climbing the ladder from small to mid, and might now be just reaching the Japanese Yen already. There are many currencies which are more volatile than BTC. This WILL reach the USD's rung in the next 24 months. When that happens a credit market will rapidly develop around BTC, and also, stablecoins are in a world of trouble in the shadow of BTC's next halving, and altcoins are in even more trouble. Entire protocols can get completely de-collateralized when stablecoins wobble on their pegs and arbitrageurs are nowhere to be found, because volume spikes will make transactions unaffordable, and because bitcoin will emerge as collateral. And collateral is money, as we're starting to rapidly learn with the Ukraine crisis and commodities. This more than regulation in my opinion, will be the s-curve adoption shakeout we've been waiting for, much to the chagrin of the web 3 shills--apologies if you're a holder of these things with mega-lottery environments built around them.\n\nThis post is written as a chicken-noodle soup of sorts for the BTC holder's soul, because volatility is hard to digest especially for noobs, but counterintuitively, it proves BTC is working, and it makes hedging quite expensive, which brings its own protective benefits in this free market. So you HODL, buy, repeat. You listen to the heartbeat of the only truly free market asset in existence, and ignore the mainstream talking points. Bitcoin's longterm chart is a tale of highs and lows. But between that is a relentless and healthy uptrend. Why is that? Thanks for reading.\n\n\\--Mallardshead \ud83e\udd86",

When you combine that with the on-chain metrics of coins relentlessly getting drawn off exchange reserves, and the fact no major miners are selling (a problem previously because of credit markets), you have a recipe for a legitimate supply crisis, that can push bitcoin stratospheric. It'll fall 50% or so after to meet the rapid arbitrage and gap closing, but I've generally liked to watch miners who are responsible for the 900 BTC ($31M) being added to the supply every 24 hours.

I see the biggest selling point is that because it's not connected to the internet and you don't need to connect it to the internet that it's \"Safer\". \n\nWith the basic premise that the wallet cards come with a scratch off revealing the private key just means that the addresses were already generated along with their key at a previous instance. What's to say that information isn't stored anywhere? Who controls it? Where are the security protocols involving safeguarding pregenerated keys? If this information is anywhere it can and most likely will be exploited. \n\nAlso, just... so many concerns overall. Why is a phone camera being used to scan a private key? \n\nI mean, I understand how this is a basic educational tool and something to introduce new people to crypto, but as a serious cold storage or even anything else other than to try out a few transactions... it just does not seem secure.",

I listened to a few podcasts where insiders explain what they would do to hack someone and the lengths these people are willing to go to to score a \"lick\"? is crazy and fucking scary and I just don't feel safe storing my seed phrase in physical, readable form anywhere anymore, To think that I used to keep my seed phrase in my desk drawer like a lazy idiot smh.\n\nAnd it's not safe to store it in a digital form either and I feel like the safest way would be on a hardware wallet with a long complex enough pass phrase that I can memories easily.\n\nThoughts?  \n\n\nEdit: \n\nThe bitcoin support team is going to help me figure this out. It's all good now. lmfao   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s47cb4l3gfy81.png?width=1157&format=png&auto=webp&s=19f8ea9cc76f7371d34198af7953860183436a5a",

Static files, like research papers, require negligible cpu time and memory. Sci-Hub also probably don't use much bandwidth (I'm assuming based on the nature of their content). So the thing they're probably paying the most for is disk space. Assuming each manuscript takes 1MB (which is probably way too high), that's 85TB.

I'm curious if anyone can spot any holes in my logic below:\n\n21M BTC / 8B humans = 0.00263 BTC/human.\n\nThis didn't sit right with me. BTC and investing in general is largely a developed world thing. So I thought I'd take the estimate of \"num humans in developed world\" that Google \\[1\\] gave me of 1.3B:\n\n21M BTC / 1.3B humans = 0.01615 BTC/human\n\nStill pretty damned low. But this is ALL humans in developed worlds. What about kids? According to this statista link \\[2\\], 26% of all humans are kids < 15, so there's roughly 950M adults in developed world:\n\n21M BTC / 962M humans = 0.02183 BTC/human\n\nStill an impressively low BTC/human count. But not everyone invests, even in developed worlds. Let's use this Gallup \\[3\\] polls data of \"56% of people above 18 invest\" as a proxy, leaving us with \\~540M humans:\n\n21M BTC / 538.72M humans = 0.03898 BTC/human\n\nSo unless my math is shite, or I've missed another way to cut it down - the number I've arrived at states, \"Given a supply of 21M BTC, and approximately 538.72 million humans in the developed world who typically invest and are over the age of 15, you can expect 0.03898 to be the average in a saturated market\".\n\nDo what you will with the data, but it does seem to skew \"if BTC saturates, owning a whole coin will be a big deal\". Pardon me if this is well known or not.\n\n\\----\n\nLinks:\n\n\\[1\\] Google link for population of the developed world: [https://www.google.com/search?q=population+of+the+developed+world](https://www.google.com/search?q=population+of+the+developed+world&sxsrf=ALiCzsY6A_Y8oBqt9N3sbX-aznh4F0YbxA%3A1652037364852&ei=9BZ4YsjSM8uK0PEPquKvgAg&ved=0ahUKEwjInKbiztD3AhVLBTQIHSrxC4AQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=population+of+the+developed+world&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCGAzIFCAAQhgMyBQgAEIYDMgUIABCGAzoHCAAQRxCwAzoECCMQJzoECAAQQzoFCAAQkQI6CwguEIAEELEDEIMBOggIABCABBCxAzoHCAAQsQMQQzoICAAQsQMQkQI6CggAEIAEEIcCEBQ6BggAEBYQHjoICAAQFhAKEB5KBAhBGABKBAhGGABQiwRYoSFg5yFoAXABeACAAXqIAbwUkgEEMjYuNpgBAKABAcgBCMABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz)\n\n\\[2\\] Statista link on population by age: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/265759/world-population-by-age-and-region/#:\\~:text=As%20of%20mid%2D2020%2C%20about,were%20under%2015%20years%20old.&text=Globally%2C%20about%2026%20percent%20of,over%2065%20years%20of%20age](https://www.statista.com/statistics/265759/world-population-by-age-and-region/#:~:text=As%20of%20mid%2D2020%2C%20about,were%20under%2015%20years%20old.&text=Globally%2C%20about%2026%20percent%20of,over%2065%20years%20of%20age).\n\n\\[3\\] Gallup poll on adults 18+ that invest: [https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx](https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx)",

You check coins one by one. You might use a counter to keep track of which ones you've already checked, but it doesn't create progress.  When you check all 2^32 coins, if none are found you just immediately switch to a new set of 2^32 coins.

What I am fascinated by is the correlation to BTC pricing and MSTR\u2019s stock price.  It\u2019s almost like the stock market sees MSTR as a BTC proxy.\n\nSaylor (or probably his CFO) is not worried about a silly little margin call on some BTC.  Nope - he is freaking out b/c of MSTR\u2019s $2.4B of fixed and VARIABLE rate debt, who\u2019s annual interest payments currently consumes almost half of the firm\u2019s EBITDA.  If the equity/debt ratio hits a certain number, or EBITDA drops to a certain #, then covenants begin to trip.  Loans can be called in full at that point.  He only has $93M in cash, so to \u201cmake whole\u201d, he will have to\u2026..yes, that right\u2026sell a lot of BTC because his traditional lenders will want $$.  Don\u2019t worry about $21,000 per coin, worry about MSTR\u2019s market cap going below his debt outstanding (almost there btw).  That will be the first \u201dcoin\u201d to drop.",

By no means a whale or billionaire but he's doing very well. \n\n  \nLast November, he asked us about a shitcoin that he bought (along with an interest in the underlying blockchain company), he put in about $500k and was asking what to do with it since it had 10x'd in a few weeks and was now worth $5mm. In the next few days while we were trying to find someone who had crypto/blockchain expertise to comment on this coin (not even top 50 market cap), it had gone to $15mm. By the time we got back to him probably a week or two later, it was worth $25mm. Literally $500k to $25mm in a manner of weeks. We told him honestly there was no way to value it, he basically hit the lottery and to sell at least *some* of it. He didn't sell a penny. It's now worth $3mm (and dropping quickly). He did not give a shit because it does not affect his lifestyle at all and he's basically said may as well hold it as a long term lottery ticket, if it goes to $0 oh well.   \n\n\nWhales are just people. Of course they *tend* to have better discipline and generally be well educated, strong networks/connections, etc. But they don't have a crystal ball. They make dumb mistakes just like the rest of us.",

This bear market however, I'm relatively at peace and just continuing to DCA every week. I think it could hit as low as $24k, which would be great. Sure, my portfolio has been hit hard like a lot of folks, but I do see this as an opportunity to really dig in and get some solid exposure before the bulls return in the coming years. I'm looking forward to mid-late 2024. Playing the long game.",

It quite literally took months to sync from scratch because I'm running it on a raspberry pi 3 and an old 1TB HDD, it's not powerful enough to run umbrel and the Bitcoin Core GUI kept crashing too, so it's just using the Bitcoin Core daemon. I made sure to set up port forwarding on my router too, so the node can accept inbound connections and fully participate in relaying transactions and blocks to peers.\n\nQuite exciting to be running a part of the network, now I need to learn how to use the node to verify my own transactions and I can use Bitcoin completely trust-free.",

When people realized that they couldn't get their money out of the banks, they bought Bitcoin because it still worked.  The price shot up from something like $50 to $1000 in response to that.\n\nWhat do you think will happen when banking/credit/currency crisis hits on a GLOBAL scale and Bitcoin still works just fine as a way to hold and transfer wealth?\n\nMoral of the story:  Don't sweat a down day.  We have seen way worse days than today on the way up to $30K from zero.  When in doubt, zoom out and look at the bigger picture.  You are holding the money of the future.  How it is valued in the money of the past is irrelevant.",

But my question is this: What was the theoretical distribution of the bitcoin. There was a famous mathematician that invented a curve. By that curve, we could calculate how the bitcoin will be distributed in the future. It was something like 50% will have 0.001, 30% will have 0.01, or something like that. But I don't remember the curve's name because I don't remember the mathematician. I want to know where I will be percent wise by that curve so I know my hard work stacking sats doesn't go to waste :D. At least I want to be 10%-20% and need to know how much I need to buy to be in that spot :D.",
