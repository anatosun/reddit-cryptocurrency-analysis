We can't reasonably consolidate. I think these articles should specify that they're talking about Big Ticket items. But this doesn't apply to a pack of cigarettes. I'm a clerk in a gas station. When you say Merchants I'm thinking of me. And no one's going to pay $100 conversion fee to buy a $13 pack of cigarettes. If it was $100,000 piece of equipment then they wouldn't even notice it. And I just think the people who write these stories should specify this. And if you are talking about small ticket items then you should specify how that's going to work.",
