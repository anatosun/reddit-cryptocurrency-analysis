If you just want to test this \"tutorial\" try some public installation (e.g. [https://wallet.paralelnipolis.cz/](https://wallet.paralelnipolis.cz/))\n3. Install Satdress [https://github.com/andrerfneves/lightning-address/blob/master/BRIDGE.md](https://github.com/andrerfneves/lightning-address/blob/master/BRIDGE.md) you can skip this step and use existing one (for example payaddress.cobtcadresse.deln.fitti.iobitmia.compaymentlink.xyztinytip.mesats.pmlnpay.czgetalby.comlnaddress.melnaddress.netlightning.bylightning.re) but you need to trust them because yhey route request. Your LN adress would look like for example [satoshi@lnpay.cz](mailto:satoshi@lnpay.cz) if you install it in your VPS than your address will be <username>@<mywebsite.com>\n4. Create wallet in LNbits and than fill form in Satdress - fill desired username, select LNbits backed (for example [https://mywebsite.com](https://mywebsite.com):<LNbits port> (without slash at end), paste your Invoice/read key, save secret PIN\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou don't need to youse LNbits, there are other LNURL backends but I have good experience with it so I can recommend it. If it works you can drop few sats to [mmic@lnpay.cz](mailto:mmic@lnpay.cz)",
