I found someone recommending a cross from 30 day EMA over 60 days as buy and 60 over 30 as sell signal. (Last sell was April 16)\n\nBacktesting this strat seemed to work out, but can it be this easy?

Redistribution can mean taking privileges away from the military-industrial complex. Cutting those fuckers out means much fewer expenses on the Federal budget. When you lower expenses, it is easier to balance the books. Redistribution isn't just taking away from the hyper-wealthy.

Yes, obviously if you confiscate them the debt \"disappears\". Or you could simply declare them worthless and irredeemable.

The old people accumulate the debt and they leave it for the younger generation to pay off. As long as the US population breeds enough younglings to pay off older generations' debts, the engine will keep going. Debts are always paid - just not by the one who accumulated it.",

Print money to infinity and erase debts yes they could, the reason why the dollar doesn\u2019t  plummet overnight because of this reality is because the vast  majority of people and institutions believe that the fed will not do that and are correct in their belief  because in America the government is ran by the rich and is one of the most successful capitalistic societies of all time. Essentially we have cash and hold value in cash because we believe in that basic fact staying true as it has for a 100+ years and likely will for a 100+ more because there isn\u2019t anything showing they would do otherwise. Now Bitcoin doomsday anti fiat people do not believe in the us gov. Which is absolutely their right. But ironically if the USD did crash because people lost faith in us economy and it\u2019s future, then Bitcoin would also be worth nothing because people would resort back to a \u201creal\u201d value currency such as a commodity or something backed by a commodity that has some sort of tangible value. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t really have any tangible value and is purely relying on people to prop up its value with fiat. It\u2019s quite literally propped up by the thing pro Bitcoin people hate, fiat currency! The reality is if fiat currency were to disappear what is your Bitcoin worth in trade? Nothing!! Bitcoin is only worth anything because people can sell it for the thing that they can actually sell said Bitcoin for and that is cash!.

Do u understand what I\u2019m saying? This is why no company will ever accept it for any reason other then to cash into USD. If I say I value Bitcoin at $5 but the us government values it at a different amount how do we determine discrepancies in what I pay my taxes? This is part of the reason why Bitcoin fluctuates so much in value, because there is not entity backing the value.  I personally believe bitcoins value closely follows the stock markets as people treat it like an investment that they can cash in and out of not hold. The whole decentralized idea of Bitcoin is great as long as your operating under the assumption that the USD will fail some day.

The Nations and countries  that have gone bankrupt over the past few decades lacked any ability to dictate its own monetary policy, ie were not monetarily sovereign. The US does not have that issue , so no one can force it into bankruptcy. It prints the money it needs. However it only has this ability at the Federal level. States , cities , towns and individuals are not monetarily sovereign entities",

You pay tax and the government uses your tax dollars to provide services and infrastructure. \n\nExcept, no. \n\nThe US Government has borrowed an unimaginable amount of money to give away to defense contractors and anyone who gives congress people political donations, usually micro-pennies to the dollar. Your taxes just keep the US from going into default as they pay the interest of that debt.\n\nEvery year the service to the US National Debt takes a few more days of the total taxes collected for the calendar year to cover. Anyone with math skills should be able to understand, someday in the not too distant future, the interest on the debt will take all of the taxes collected for the entire year to pay. At that point we'll probably get a few extra years whilst they juggle the books and borrow even more money to pay the interest At some point the spend-and-tax system will fail when China, who has more dollars than they know what to do with, will dump them onto the market for a fraction of a what they were worth, and you can easily see how this spiral will end up plunging the country into a financial total meltdown. China will defeat us without a weapon. They will watch us spend ourselves to death. While they have full authoritative control over their own people.",
