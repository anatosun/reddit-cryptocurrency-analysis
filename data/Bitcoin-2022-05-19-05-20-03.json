We've seen a small amount of potential decoupling in the last week or so.  IMHO, it is more just BTC either front running market sentiment or just generally more evening out because BTC trades 24/7 while equities do not.  You'll see it on a weekend where BTC may go down 7-8%, then Monday is a 5% drop in the equities market and BTC stays flat or maybe even a small increase.  To me, that is not really decoupling as the overall trends are roughly the same, but they are happening at slightly different times. \n\nThe other answer could just be whales/institutions buying.  Micro has said they are not selling, but would not answer whether they are currently buying more.  If they're out there doing another 100M+ buying spree, you would see some upward pressure on price.",

It wouldn't necessarily be obvious to an observer that the money coming into your account is from selling bitcoin. It wouldn't be suitable for very large sums though: [https://bisq.network/](https://bisq.network/)\n\nThe other way to offload is by simply spending your bitcoin. I find that the most convenient way of doing this is via BitRefill, where you can buy vouchers for most major retailers. BitRefill requires no KYC and accepts lightning transactions (which are both far cheaper and private than on-chain): [https://www.bitrefill.com/](https://www.bitrefill.com/)",
