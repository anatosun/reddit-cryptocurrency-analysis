For some reason there isnt enough cash on the market , so everything is selling off way way below it should.\n\nI think one of the reasons is because of companies like Tether needing billions of dollars of cash due to USD withdrawals, and being willing to pay 30-50% interest rates for USD loans. So many big whales are selling their crypto and giving cash to Tether for these rates, who knows maybe they pay higher rates in private, eg, they tell the whales they will pay the loan back with crypto, just not at this time when they dont have cash.\n\nCapitulation may be a good risk/reward to invest in actual good projects since they will easily recover in the future.",
