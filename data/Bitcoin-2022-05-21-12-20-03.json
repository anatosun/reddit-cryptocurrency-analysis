You see rich people with more wealth that they could possibly enjoy in a single lifetime and then you see yourself, struggling and you can't understand why, why are you living month to month barely getting by. You talk to people like r/antiwork and you find out you are not alone so you lach onto one of the popular explanations for why this is. The rich man is bad! The government is bad! The capitalist system is bad! You are being exploited at your job! etc etc \n\nBut you never learned what really is the primary cause of your suffering. And it's this: https://youtu.be/sI1C9DyIi_8 \n\nYou don't understand the exponential function and just what 2% per year inflation target by your central bank really means for your money. \n\nYou don't understand that this POLICY, publicly stated by YOUR central bank, is the main reason why you can't get ahead. Because you don't think 2% per year is a big deal. You don't get how the exponential function works as it's very counter intuitive. You don't get that 2% per year means in just 35 years your money will be worth HALF of what it was on the day you earned it. And you don't understand that if they overshoot their target(again publicly stated as some sort of virtue called \"price stability\") and the inflation is really 7% this happens in just 10 years. 10 fucking years and your savings lose half of it's purchasing power!!\n\nTHIS is the cage you are in.\n\nIt's the monetary system of steady decrease of the value of money you earn. And guess what, the way this inflation is achieved helps out the richer getting even more rich.\n\nI guess what the purpose of my message to you is, understand the cage you are in. Because if you fail to do this, you will never get out. Learn about money and monetary systems, support people who speak out against the current global monetary enslavement scam, put your wealth into money and assets that can't be inflated(gold, bitcoin, land, commodities) and spread this knowledge.\n\nIt's not hopeless. In fact with the invention of the internet and Bitcoin it's as hopefull as it ever was as this is a really really old scheme(think Romans old) and we have tools to fight it for the first time in human history. But you have to learn what the real problem is, the exponential function is really counter intuitive and it's how they keep you blind to just how much pain their 2% per year cuases you.\n\nGood luck and peace out.",

                    "response": "It's not just inflation, but bailouts that's the problem.\n\nImagine two men with the same investment strategy: keep 6 months living expenses in cash and the rest in stocks. The first man has a net worth of $100k and living expenses of $2.5k/month. This means he has 15% of his net worth in cash and 85% in stocks. The second man has a net worth of $1M and living expenses of $10k/month. This means he has 6% of his net worth in cash and 94% on stocks. If in a year interest was 1% on cash and the stock market went up by 5%, the first man is 4.4% richer, but the rich man is 4.76% richer. That may not sound like a lot, but he's richer in both absolute and % terms. Over time, the rich get richer.\n\nHigher interest rates diminish this effect both by making the cash earn more and diminishing stock returns, but that just slows things down.\n\nThe natural solution is market crashes, which periodically take from the rich who invested poorly, invested using leverage or otherwise took great advantage of the system. Without bailouts, the rich would have to keep more cash on hand for emergencies, and over time, only the cautious and careful investor who did the hard work of discovering businesses useful enough that market gyrations can't stop them would prosper. Those who can't do that could always save cash instead, not to get rich, but to support themselves during lean times and in retirement.\n\n\nLow interest rates/inflation make taking advantage of the system possible, and force the average man to invest in stocks to slow how quickly he gets poorer and make him accept bailouts that he doesn't realize benefit richer men much more than they benefit him. Bailouts serve to solidify ill-gotten gains and encourage imprudent risk taking that is counter-productive to real economic growth.",

Increasing the money supply in proportion to economic growth keeps prices stable, which lets people plan for the future efficiently. Neither gold nor BTC allow a central bank to do that. I realize that today's problem is that central banks print way more than is required by economic growth and the distribution plan involves huge benefits to the already wealthy, but it does make lending a reasonable thing to do, which does accelerate good ideas. The correlation between inflationary fiat, huge growth in tech and the average material wealth of almost everyone isn't a coincidence.

Doing so through inflation implies certain sectors like housing seeing the brunt of inflation, this has turned houses from something average people can afford into an asset where the percentage of people who own multiple homes (investment properties) rises against those who own only one home.  Problems with inflation aside, I am unsure of what you mean by tyranny of the saver; under a bitcoin standard a Schwab will be forced to make investments that are profitable and grow the economic pie, rather than devising schemes to take a larger share of the stagnated pie we have today.  No one with that much wealth can manage it efficiently, it may take years or it may take centuries, but over time his share of the pie will shrink as he makes marginally negative investments overall.  The amount of wealth he has doesn't give him power under bitcoin, only his spending, and if he is blowing money on controlling people then his position will slide.",

But by \"price stability\", I suppose I mean \"the price of money\", by which I mean relative wealth. Under A better than present (though perhaps not ideal) monetary policy, maybe tomorrow you can buy more food but less energy, but overall your socioeconomic status goes neither up nor down simply by holding currency. This is desirable because you can then wait for the right opportunity to deploy capital rather than do so out of fear of losing purchasing power, but you don't get richer just by sitting on your piggy bank.\n\nBy tyranny of the saver, I mean exactly what all us HODLs are hoping for: Bitcoin goes way up and we get to retire early. We live a life of luxury just because we bought at the right time, not because we contributed to the common good.\n\nBut you have a good point. In the short run (which may be generations), we could live on our outsized share of wealth. But eventually it would dwindle and we would be forced to either work or invest it. We couldn't just live off the interest, because lending under a deflationary currency is madness. For the borrower, you would have to do better than average in a zero-sum game to pay back the loan. For the lender, why would you believe the borrow could pay you back, especially with bankruptcy laws that let him not do so. So there would be no opportunity for \"guaranteed\" income at any interest rate - you have to put your BTC at risk in exchange for equity.",

When a mutation appears in a gene pool that gives a very real and impactful advantage to the individuals benefitting from that mutation, it will tend to spread very rapidly throughout that gene pool. It's simple, really: since the individuals that have the mutation tend, on average, to fare better than those who don't, then those individuals will tend to proliferate more in the gene pool.\n\nThe thing is, mutations happen overnight. Some will argue it's a gradual process (say, birds with hollow bones vs birds with full bones; for a bird to evolve hollow bones (and keep them), they need to provide it a meaningful advantage over other alternatives. But for that, the bird first needs to be able to fly, or else hollow bones are useless. So it first needs to have wings, be below a certain weight for its size, etc.). But all these different mutations happen independently of each other. Sure, the second one (hollow bones) needs the first one (wings) to be stable before it can become useful, so it's less likely to appear. But just because mutation A exists, doesn't make mutation B more likely to happen. It just makes it more likely to stick IF it ever happens at all.\n\nI'm of the school of thought that social evolutions work in much the same way. There is an equilibrium which we all need to acknowledge in order to function adequately in society. But sometimes, an event will appear that drastically changes that equilibrium (COVID-19, for example, or the emergence of a new technology like Bitcoin). When that happens, the equilibrium gets displaced overnight (for those familiar with game theory, I'm talking about Nash equilibriums here). And when that happens, the only logical thing to do is to adapt to the new environment that creates. There is no going back, there is no avoiding those new circumstances. *The optimal way to play the game has changed, because the very rules of the game have changed.*\n\nI believe this is exactly what is happening with Bitcoin. The equilibrium was displaced in 2009, when Bitcoin first came online and was accepted by the cryptographic community. Since then, all we have been seeing is the market slowly adapting to this new reality. The rules of the global financial game have changed overnight, and everyone has been trying to find the new optimal playstyle since then. But naturally, some people don't see this change yet, since it is not that obvious yet. And naturally, others will reject it, whether out of a preference for the old system or out of fear of change. But still naturally, these people will get fazed out of the game very quickly once the new rules become so ubiquitous nobody has a choice but to follow them. So right now, it's a race for who can figure out these new rules fastest with the most precision. The ones that don't or refuse will get left behind through the brutal nature of evolution. The better adapted individuals will tend to prevail in the gene pool. Those with poorer adaptations will tend to fail to produce quality offspring (whether children or deliberate works) and disappear over time.",

At this point in its existence it only protects over longer timeframes (2-4 years) though. The reason being is OG holders have massive positions that need to be unwound, a decently high issuance rate (~2%) and access to high amounts of leverage (20x) all lead to high volatility. I have always believed that the 2028-2032 halvings are when we see price volatility significantly calm down. Large individual holders will have dispersed to larger groups of people, inflation will be well under 1% and exchanges will forced to bring leverage into a reasonable range (probably 3-7x). All these factors will lead to the swings calming TF down.",

I'd bet almost all rich people will seem very nice if you meet them in person. I doubt there's a way to make and/or keep money if you're not good at that.\n\nBut what about their actions? They accumulate property and power. They more they have, the more they want. Once you learn to live with a certain amount, having less causes fear, panic, anger and a sense of injustice against you. This isn't unique to the rich, it just seems silly when we see it in those better off than we are. But what about when those worse off accuse us of the same thing? What would someone in a third world country think of the lifestyle of a lower middle class American?\n\nIn the old westerns the bad guy wore black. In more nuanced films he's a silver-tongued liar.

But as Marxist I can tell you that genuine Marxist theory knows all about \u201ccreeping inflation\u201d. However, Marxist theory has better explanations for why creeping inflation is the target. It\u2019s not just an arbitrary \u201cpolicy\u201d that the economy could function perfectly well, in fact better, without. It\u2019s part and parcel of one unitary systematic whole: the capitalist economy-state. The explanations for why this is so, why creeping inflation is just one necessary part of a larger system that cannot function *at all* without all of its parts, is obviously beyond the scope of a Reddit thread, that\u2019s why Marxists need to write massive tomes in order to explain how it all fits together.\n\nSuffice it to say the following. It is not *because* money (real money, not what you in your head decided is money) is what it is that we are unfree, that we live in an unfree society. It\u2019s the other way around. The type of (very unfree) society we live is what makes money what it is, with all the insanities and perverse incentives that come with that.\n\nMarx wasn\u2019t even the first to point this out. The Neapolitan economist, Galiani, made the same fundamental point in his treatise on money. It is the whole of society - not it\u2019s laws and policies, but the fundamental nature of the social relations of power between its subjects - that determines the nature of money.\n\nThis is why you can\u2019t change society by inventing a new kind of money and convincing people to use it. It takes a genuine social revolution to change society, and that social revolution must actually succeed in revolutionizing the relations of power that make up society - it can\u2019t just put new people in charge, or replace old policies with new ones. It\u2019s society that ultimately determines which policies \u201cwork\u201d and which ones don\u2019t - although no one can blame you for thinking it\u2019s the other way around (that the policies and laws in place determine the nature of society). It\u2019s society\u2019s fundamental makeup of social relations that forces the \u201cleaders\u201d hands whether they like it or not - just as in days of old, the king *in theory* had complete arbitrary power to make any laws he desired, but in reality, his legitimacy and thus his power depended on choosing the right laws.",

If I had to guess, I think you relate fairness to a starting \"equity\" among people. My view is different, more like \"nobody really have any sort of rights to have a 'good' starting point whatsoever\", so I see inheritance exactly as a donation.\n\nBtw Bitcoin touches very deeply into this, since it can make a reality that people can effectively decide whether they wanna take their bits to the grave, or donate/\"let-be-inherited\" without intervention from outsiders. For me, I think this property align well with my values..",

In a fair society, people would ask for what they deserve, no more, no less. I think this as many society sub-systems, in which, if everybody took this \"fair\" choice, everybody would be happier, due to the many changes to this small subsystems that conform a broader one.\n\nFairness and freedom will always conflict though, since fairness derives from conflicts of interest in the majority of the cases, if not all. So it's a hard theme to debate, because I also have that \"greed as constant\" thing, in which my individualism conflicts with that analysis. That's why I also like bitcoin.\n\nBut the reason I like bitcoin, is because this utopic vision of reality, is well.. utopic. I don't trust on how the state allocates resources, and I think we should re-define how resources should be allocated for the betterment of society.\n\nWealth inequality is needed too in our current economic system, at least untill we manage to automate all of humanities basic needs and be able to pay a universal basic income due to those automations. We are far from that, since the focus isn't there.\n\nI think everybody should have a better standing ground, and that individual actions can help the broader system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne last thing, quoting:\n\n>\"nobody really have any sort of rights to have a 'good' starting point whatsoever\"\n\nI completely agree with this sentence, but that's what I mean by seeing donations differently. If resources were allocated correctly, instead of the lucky kid (he still should receive a sum), we could help with the broader system, eventually leading to more global happiness.\n\nBut yeah, fairness and freedom will always clash, and It's another balance to have in mind.",

I wonder what happened to this guy in his life to have this mindset.\n\nAll this talk about having to reduce population is anxiety enducing. Even thinking about something like this seems really morally wrong. Whoever gets to decide does it in their self interest. \n\nThe part where he says: \"What part of our lives is better by increasing population?\"\n\nWell, what about all the luxuries we are enjoying today like clean water,  abundant food and services. The more people we have, the better everyones life is going to get since there are more of us solving problems.\n\nWe just need a non-pollution energy production. With abundant energy all other problems are taken care of.\n\nThere are some good points in this video, but overall I think content like this is harmful because it attracts more nihilism.",
