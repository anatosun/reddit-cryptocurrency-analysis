You see rich people with more wealth that they could possibly enjoy in a single lifetime and then you see yourself, struggling and you can't understand why, why are you living month to month barely getting by. You talk to people like r/antiwork and you find out you are not alone so you lach onto one of the popular explanations for why this is. The rich man is bad! The government is bad! The capitalist system is bad! You are being exploited at your job! etc etc \n\nBut you never learned what really is the primary cause of your suffering. And it's this: https://youtu.be/sI1C9DyIi_8 \n\nYou don't understand the exponential function and just what 2% per year inflation target by your central bank really means for your money. \n\nYou don't understand that this POLICY, publicly stated by YOUR central bank, is the main reason why you can't get ahead. Because you don't think 2% per year is a big deal. You don't get how the exponential function works as it's very counter intuitive. You don't get that 2% per year means in just 35 years your money will be worth HALF of what it was on the day you earned it. And you don't understand that if they overshoot their target(again publicly stated as some sort of virtue called \"price stability\") and the inflation is really 7% this happens in just 10 years. 10 fucking years and your savings lose half of it's purchasing power!!\n\nTHIS is the cage you are in.\n\nIt's the monetary system of steady decrease of the value of money you earn. And guess what, the way this inflation is achieved helps out the richer getting even more rich.\n\nI guess what the purpose of my message to you is, understand the cage you are in. Because if you fail to do this, you will never get out. Learn about money and monetary systems, support people who speak out against the current global monetary enslavement scam, put your wealth into money and assets that can't be inflated(gold, bitcoin, land, commodities) and spread this knowledge.\n\nIt's not hopeless. In fact with the invention of the internet and Bitcoin it's as hopefull as it ever was as this is a really really old scheme(think Romans old) and we have tools to fight it for the first time in human history. But you have to learn what the real problem is, the exponential function is really counter intuitive and it's how they keep you blind to just how much pain their 2% per year cuases you.\n\nGood luck and peace out.",

                    "response": "It's not just inflation, but bailouts that's the problem.\n\nImagine two men with the same investment strategy: keep 6 months living expenses in cash and the rest in stocks. The first man has a net worth of $100k and living expenses of $2.5k/month. This means he has 15% of his net worth in cash and 85% in stocks. The second man has a net worth of $1M and living expenses of $10k/month. This means he has 6% of his net worth in cash and 94% on stocks. If in a year interest was 1% on cash and the stock market went up by 5%, the first man is 4.4% richer, but the rich man is 4.76% richer. That may not sound like a lot, but he's richer in both absolute and % terms. Over time, the rich get richer.\n\nHigher interest rates diminish this effect both by making the cash earn more and diminishing stock returns, but that just slows things down.\n\nThe natural solution is market crashes, which periodically take from the rich who invested poorly, invested using leverage or otherwise took great advantage of the system. Without bailouts, the rich would have to keep more cash on hand for emergencies, and over time, only the cautious and careful investor who did the hard work of discovering businesses useful enough that market gyrations can't stop them would prosper. Those who can't do that could always save cash instead, not to get rich, but to support themselves during lean times and in retirement.\n\n\nLow interest rates/inflation make taking advantage of the system possible, and force the average man to invest in stocks to slow how quickly he gets poorer and make him accept bailouts that he doesn't realize benefit richer men much more than they benefit him. Bailouts serve to solidify ill-gotten gains and encourage imprudent risk taking that is counter-productive to real economic growth.",

At this point in its existence it only protects over longer timeframes (2-4 years) though. The reason being is OG holders have massive positions that need to be unwound, a decently high issuance rate (~2%) and access to high amounts of leverage (20x) all lead to high volatility. I have always believed that the 2028-2032 halvings are when we see price volatility significantly calm down. Large individual holders will have dispersed to larger groups of people, inflation will be well under 1% and exchanges will forced to bring leverage into a reasonable range (probably 3-7x). All these factors will lead to the swings calming TF down.",

It takes 7 iterations to go from 1 bacterium to filling the jar.\n\nUnderstanding exponential functions like that, and the king and the chessboard and providing a reward by doubling the grains on each square also reflect this.\n\nAs a youth with access to computers and supporting and repairing them on my own, I observed this doubling with ram... 2, 4, 8.... 4096, 8192....

People don't get the notion to extrapolate and properly calculate this provided information.  \n\nI was always told to \"show your work!\" In math class.  And now I see why.  Because if everyone walked into a bank with pen, paper and calculator and were knowledgeable with the mathematics presented in this video regarding exponential function it would wind up as exactly what henry ford said\n\n\"It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.\"",
