If so the signal is when the miner who creates a valid block broadcasts it to all other full nodes(most not controlled by miners) and those full nodes see the block and validate it and either accept or reject it in accordance to the consensus rules . Miners order transactions and full nodes validate and enforce the consensus rules.  Some of those full nodes will be used by miners and those miners will build off it .",
