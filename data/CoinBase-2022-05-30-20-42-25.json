            "selftext": "Hey all,  \n\n\nYesterday I was trying to make a purchase in advanced Coinbase, I think it's usually just easier as I don't have to keep sending the BTC back and forth. What I typically do is DCA every month, been doing so since 40k. I'm not too concerned about getting in at the best possible price as for me it's more of a long term investment than immediate gains.   \n\n\nSo I put in my order and it wasn't going through so I cancelled a few times and I believe on the third cancellation I didn't get the money back in my account. I called support and they said they were having network issues and that if I just wait it out it should resolve itself, however, I've waited all of today and it appears the issue is still persisting.  \n\n\nHas anyone else run into this issue? Not sure what I'm supposed to do.",
