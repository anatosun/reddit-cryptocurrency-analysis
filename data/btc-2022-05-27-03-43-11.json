They picked it up and said 'There's money to be made in dogs'. \ud83d\udc36\n\nTianna's dad Andy, a single father raising Tianna and her 5 siblings, sat in his car for half an hour thinking about this then drove to a local butcher and purchased a large quantity of dog brisket bones. Tianna started selling the bones initially to raise money for her Netball Club then, like most ingenious ideas with consumer demand, the concept grew and grew. \ud83d\udc15\ud83d\udcb0\ud83e\uddb4 Once she graduated from high school and with the help of her dad, Tianna set up her business which has become so popular with locals that she is expanding into the shopfront next door to open up a fishing bait store. \ud83c\udfa3\ud83d\udc1f\n\nAccepting Bitcoin Cash as payment in her Hungry Dog Pet Supplies business was a no brainer for Tianna.  \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\n\nBitcoin Cash - Future currency for future generations.\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/Hungry-Dog-P](https://www.facebook.com/Hungry-Dog-P)...\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 DigiRyder\n\n\\#BCH #BitcoinCashCity #HungryDogPetSupplies #futurecurrency #futuregenerations #youngentrepreneur #peer2peer #GenZ",
