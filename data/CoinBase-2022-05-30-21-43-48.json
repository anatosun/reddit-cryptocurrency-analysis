            "selftext": "I have a friend who is mining ETH through a node website they access through the browser section of their coinbase wallet. They are getting a return between 1-4.5% every 24hrs. The more USDT, the higher % return. I took a look at it and it appears to be a .co website. They have been doing it for a while and suggested I do it as well. The site says it\u2019s partnered audit institutions are Certik,  Slowmist, and Fairyproof. The wallets they say they are partnered with are coinbase, MetaMask, crypto.com and a slew of others. \n\nMy question is - how do I determine if this is a legitimate node mining project, legal to use in the state I\u2019m in, or legal to use in the US?",
