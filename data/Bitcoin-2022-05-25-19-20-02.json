It's a speculative asset. How much speculation do you want to do, and how much investment? You might YOLO the whole stake on BTC or any other asset right now, but you should know that you're speculating.\n\nIt's not exactly the same as gambling. You \\*could\\* gamble, putting the whole stake on red or black at a roulette table. That's almost (not quite) a 50-50 bet.\n\nSpeculating on BTC is not that. You might double, you might lose most of your stake, but either outcome would take time. Your speculation could take years to deliver your happy or sad outcome.\n\nJust don't fool yourself that either scenario is \"investing.\" Bitcoin pays no interest or dividends, and its price is determined by how its many buyers, holders and sellers feel about it. That is not something that you can invest in.\n\nGood luck, whatever you do.",

I mean, what's your mortgage rate, are you paying PMI, do you have car loans, what's the rate, is their employer match on your 401k, credit card debt, students loans (private or gov), etc.\n\nYou didn't mention having a ROTH IRA, you might want to just use the money to max that out for the next few years if you make under $140k. iBonds are worth looking into; I think the rate was like 9% recently and you are guaranteed to get the money you put in back out (rates adjust) but it's a $10k per year limit. If you do decide to put it into BTC, consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) instead of dumping it all in as the next few months could be rough, maybe, maybe not, who knows?",

There are loads of details, but if you just want inflation protection, there's where half your stash could go. (Or all of it if you're married).\n\nI think the best hedge is to own a company that is likely to remain in business, pays a dividend, and has pricing power. If inflation persists, the company's ability to raise prices along with it will serve as a hedge.\n\nPrecious metals tend to keep pace with inflation, but they aren't likely to do a lot better, over time, than keep pace, and one way or another, it costs you something to own them. Also, they already had a significant run, so you wouldn't be buying them at a time when they are massively out of favor, which is the ideal.\n\nCrypto is such a new asset that no one has yet seen how it behaves in every possible set of conditions. Lately, it has behaved like a risk asset, which is not comforting to those of us who thought it might be a store of wealth.\n\nThe first option is the only one I have some confidence in, but if you are coming to doubt \"the full faith and credit\" of the US government, then there's reason for doubt there, too.\n\nIt's a very tricky time. I have been invested in all of the asset classes over time, but right now, I'm mostly in cash. Cash that is eroding due to inflation. A poor choice, but perhaps the least bad until it's a bit more clear what happens next.\n\nGood luck. Ya pays ya money, ya takes ya chance...",

If you put in X large sum today are you prepared for the possibility that it drops by 50% tomorrow and takes 2+ years to come back up? Alternatively, are you prepared for the possibility that you decide to \u201cwait til it\u2019s cheaper\u201d and then it goes up 50% tomorrow and you\u2019re either left out or you end up Fomo\u2019ing in at the top? These are obviously extreme examples but they are thought experiments to help you test your conviction in the asset and in your confidence in an investment decision. No one knows what the price will do in the short term, but most people in this sub believe BTC is going up in the long term. That\u2019s why we say do your own research, learn as much as you can, then trust your conviction in the long term potential and dollar-cost-average your way into the asset with money you can afford to lose if the unexpected happens",
