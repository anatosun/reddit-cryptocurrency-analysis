It does seem, however, that their company is actually genuinely building a bunch of zkrollup solutions which are legit L2s. Do you think this is secretly a ruse to get support for their L1?",

Polygon is a layer-1 sidechain that runs in parallel to the main network. The network uses its own set of validators and uses a native token called $MATIC. It allows any developer to easily migrate apps from Ethereum to Polygon and take advantage of the lower fees.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.
