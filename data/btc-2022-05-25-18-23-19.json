            "selftext": "If there's one thing that BTC and BCH supporters can both agree on, it's that Bitcoin (legacy) has completely revolutionized money.\n\nSo if Bitcoin is so great, why are you still using your national currency?\n\nFor me, I treat BitcoinCash as my savings account. I allocate as much of my income as I possibly can into BCH. I try to purchase things using BCH when the option is available. I encourage local businesses to accept BCH and I tell my friends that I prefer to be paid in BCH for petty favors. I give BCH as an option when I invoice clients for my business.\n\nAnd yet, it's still such an uphill battle to \"convince\" people to use \"cryptocurrency,\" and even the ones who are \"convinced,\" (like my own S.O.!) still don't hold any BCH of their own.\n\nAt least once a week in meatspace I see a legitimate usecase for Bitcoin-based payments. So many convoluted systems can be replaced with a simple QR code. Parking meters, restaurant tabs, anywhere Apple Pay is accepted. Getting money to/from family across the country is so much easier with BCH and yet we always go through some stupid song and dance with the banks/payment apps.\n\nPart of me still recognizes that \"we're still early.\" Part of me recognizes how cringe that statement is. :)\n\nReally, until I can convince my landlord and my grocery store to accept BCH, I'm stuck with my increasingly worthless US dollars. Feels bad, man.",

Step by step.\n\nIt is now impossible to find someone who hasn't heard of Bitcoin.\n\nIt is now rare to find someone totally against crypto currency.\n\nIt is uncommon to find people who don't know \"that one friend\" that really loves crypto and who they would go to for advice if they suddenly wanted to get involved.\n\nIt is now common to find people who have a bit of crypto somewhere.\n\nWe haven't jumped over the mass adoption hurdle of people FOMO'ing in en-masse for the purposes of actually using it as currency while the price and utility skyrockets, but we aren't far off.  Maybe 4-8 years.  And every day the infrastructure, wallets, exchanges, tools, information is all getting better and better to truly onboard people at global scale.\n\nDay by day it's hard to see the difference.

There is an established financial system that most businesses and individuals operate in, therefore to survive as a consumer/producer until crypto becomes more commonplace there is a need to operate within the current model.",
