            "selftext": "So, when something gets filled (I use pro), I have to typically do some work to figure out **what** was filled. Sometimes, this takes a very long time. One easy way \\*might\\* be to open up app, go to orders and try to scroll down to filled orders section - IF it works. If these load. Often this requires force-killing the app (in iOS) and restarting the app. If the app does not crash, give an error and want to reload these, I might be in luck. Then I might be able to figure out what was filled. If the app is acting up, the next time I'm on a computer, I try to look at filled tab there and hope I can piece it together.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone else have a better way to handle all this? I would also love to get notifications about any fills - partial or otherwise - and I know the answer is \"script it yourself\", but does everyone literally script this themselves? Do people use particular project(s) on github? Are there are other dashboards using coinbase's API that don't make all this so difficult?",
