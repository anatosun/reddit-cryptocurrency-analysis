I purchased some WLUNA on Coinbase, but as some may know they\u2019re suspending trading for this token, and I\u2019m not sure what I should do with it (not talking loads of cash here). All major exchanges no longer support it from what I can tell.\n\nI did a little research and found that eToro was dealing in LUNA and wanted to check that out, but it looks like they\u2019ve disabled it there as well. My question is, are there any places I can still buy and sell LUNA?",
