            "selftext": "Three days ago, Nas Daily \u2013 posted a video featuring Binance\u2019s CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ). The 5-minute video demonstrated a glimpse of CZ\u2019s life, his journey with cryptocurrency, and the beginnings of Binance. CZ makes an actual appearance in the video as Nuseir interviews and talks on his story.\n\nThe clip highlights the gentle beginnings of CZ before being the wealthiest person in crypto. The video begins in 2013 with CZ losing $700,000 as BTC\u2019s price crashed 70%. Undeterred, he established Binance aiming to become a top 10 exchange in three years \u2014 accomplishing it in only six months. This paved the way for him to become the wealthiest man in crypto.\n\nWhen asked about CZ\u2019s net worth and how he felt about having so much money, the Binance CEO had the following to say: \u201cI don\u2019t think money is the most important factor. I don\u2019t focus on that. I focus on building products that people will use \u2014 how to make that the most efficient, most impactful thing in the world.\u201d\n\nIn a Twitter exchange under Nas Daily\u2019s video, a viewer asked CZ if he ever sold when the market crashed by 70% in 2013. CZ responded with a simple \u201cnever sold\u201d.\n\nIn recent news, it was revealed to the public that Binance committed to contributing $500 million to help fund Elon Musk\u2019s takeover of Twitter. Binance is only one of 18 other companies that are funding the offer. The news has already seen a positive impact in projects like BakerySwap, Solis, gTrade etc in less than 2days.\n\nI hope to have a story close to CZ\u2019s. Quite inspiring.",

            "selftext": "Binance's expansion into Europe looks to have hit new roadblocks, with Spanish market officials renewing their pressure.  Binance is the largest cryptocurrency market in the world and the trading place of a lot of cryptos including NFT utility tokens like Decentraland, Quint, Sandbox and so on.\n\nAccording to local media reports, Binance has been requested by Spain's market regulator, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV), to shut down its crypto derivatives service in the nation. \n\nDespite the fact that the world's largest crypto exchange recently received full regulatory permission in France, the action comes as a surprise. The exchange now plans to use France as a springboard for a continental conquest.\n\nHowever, this expansion coincides with the European Union's increasing regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrency. The bloc just approved new legislation that effectively bans decentralized wallets and puts tight reporting requirements on all cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nThe CNMV has urged Binance to reduce its derivatives sales, according to Spanish news outlet La Informacion. While the move has no significant financial implications for the exchange, it demonstrates Spanish officials' reluctance to open their doors to the exchange. \n\nThe exchange appears to have removed all derivatives-related content from its Spanish website. However, it allows those with continuous contracts to keep their jobs. \n\nThe CNMV's antipathy to crypto derivatives stems from the huge possibility for investors to lose money in the market. In 2021, it expressed concern over this. \n\nBinance falls under a murky area of financial legislation in Spain. The exchange has yet to receive a formal virtual currency license from Spain's central bank, despite applying for one in early 2021.\n\nOther exchanges such as local Bit2Me have already secured regulatory approval. But this approval also means that exchanges will have to comply with strict reporting and anti-money laundering laws.\n\nAccording to reports, the crypto exchange mostly followed regulatory guidelines in order to gain license from the central bank. However, this strategy isn't unique to Spain. \n\nTo appease financial regulators, the exchange has often claimed its adherence to local regulations. It's also one of the first exchanges to abide by tough economic restrictions imposed on Russia as a result of its invasion of Ukraine. \n\nDespite this, Binance's regulatory journey has not always been easy. Due to increased scrutiny from the financial watchdog, the exchange had to shut down operations in Canada's most populated province.",

If this gets up, I will guarantee that the only stablecoins to see the light of day (aka mainstream adoption and use) are CBDC's! Digital fuckin FIAT! \n\nAnd 90% of people will welcome them with open arms and think CBDC's = crypto! \n\nThis is a stratigic move by the status quo to insert their broken, currupt system back into the crypto space! Mark my words, if these CBDC's are successfully implemented, they will ledgislate that the carry trade not be in things like USDT, USDC and so on but USCBDC, UKCBDC, AUDCBDC and so on. \n\nThose in the space early remember WHY this space was created. The futher we go along mass adoption, the more that ideal gets diluted. \n\nCBDC's are a centralised blockchain the government will run and keep private. It's nothing more then digital fiat and we have refused it for decades globally! \n\nCBDC's are a HUGE threat to what crypto was fighting!",
