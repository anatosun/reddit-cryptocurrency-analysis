            "selftext": "Three days ago, Nas Daily \u2013 posted a video featuring Binance\u2019s CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ). The 5-minute video demonstrated a glimpse of CZ\u2019s life, his journey with cryptocurrency, and the beginnings of Binance. CZ makes an actual appearance in the video as Nuseir interviews and talks on his story.\n\nThe clip highlights the gentle beginnings of CZ before being the wealthiest person in crypto. The video begins in 2013 with CZ losing $700,000 as BTC\u2019s price crashed 70%. Undeterred, he established Binance aiming to become a top 10 exchange in three years \u2014 accomplishing it in only six months. This paved the way for him to become the wealthiest man in crypto.\n\nWhen asked about CZ\u2019s net worth and how he felt about having so much money, the Binance CEO had the following to say: \u201cI don\u2019t think money is the most important factor. I don\u2019t focus on that. I focus on building products that people will use \u2014 how to make that the most efficient, most impactful thing in the world.\u201d\n\nIn a Twitter exchange under Nas Daily\u2019s video, a viewer asked CZ if he ever sold when the market crashed by 70% in 2013. CZ responded with a simple \u201cnever sold\u201d.\n\nIn recent news, it was revealed to the public that Binance committed to contributing $500 million to help fund Elon Musk\u2019s takeover of Twitter. Binance is only one of 18 other companies that are funding the offer. The news has already seen a positive impact in projects like BakerySwap, Solis, gTrade etc in less than 2days.\n\nI hope to have a story close to CZ\u2019s. Quite inspiring.",

But of course the true value is whatever someone is willing to actually pay for an item, not the ticket price someone wants to sell at.\n\nSo on those graphs you are seeing a bunch of Limit Orders where people are saying they'd like to buy at a much lower price. But that doesn't mean it will hit that price and their order will complete ... they might pull the order and set the price even lower, just on the off-chance they get lucky.",

The entire market would U-turn immediately. We'd see 100k Bitcoin in a week if that happened. This alone tells you that the entire markets performance is based on narrative. The narrative they're trying to push right now is interest hikes/inflation and the war with Russia. In reality this is all bullshit scapegoat propaganda to try to cover their market manipulation. The top whales aren't selling and you can look this up. So I have no idea why the average Joe would be selling.",

Same as the stock market.\n\nAlso providing liquidity is a thing, some rule about every buyer must have a seller or some bs, so the MM will just internailze that order, instead of putting it on the free market. \n\nBut luckily web3 and DeFi will change that. NFTs will also change that, no more selling synthetics and no more internalization.",

            "selftext": "Binance's expansion into Europe looks to have hit new roadblocks, with Spanish market officials renewing their pressure.  Binance is the largest cryptocurrency market in the world and the trading place of a lot of cryptos including NFT utility tokens like Decentraland, Quint, Sandbox and so on.\n\nAccording to local media reports, Binance has been requested by Spain's market regulator, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV), to shut down its crypto derivatives service in the nation. \n\nDespite the fact that the world's largest crypto exchange recently received full regulatory permission in France, the action comes as a surprise. The exchange now plans to use France as a springboard for a continental conquest.\n\nHowever, this expansion coincides with the European Union's increasing regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrency. The bloc just approved new legislation that effectively bans decentralized wallets and puts tight reporting requirements on all cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nThe CNMV has urged Binance to reduce its derivatives sales, according to Spanish news outlet La Informacion. While the move has no significant financial implications for the exchange, it demonstrates Spanish officials' reluctance to open their doors to the exchange. \n\nThe exchange appears to have removed all derivatives-related content from its Spanish website. However, it allows those with continuous contracts to keep their jobs. \n\nThe CNMV's antipathy to crypto derivatives stems from the huge possibility for investors to lose money in the market. In 2021, it expressed concern over this. \n\nBinance falls under a murky area of financial legislation in Spain. The exchange has yet to receive a formal virtual currency license from Spain's central bank, despite applying for one in early 2021.\n\nOther exchanges such as local Bit2Me have already secured regulatory approval. But this approval also means that exchanges will have to comply with strict reporting and anti-money laundering laws.\n\nAccording to reports, the crypto exchange mostly followed regulatory guidelines in order to gain license from the central bank. However, this strategy isn't unique to Spain. \n\nTo appease financial regulators, the exchange has often claimed its adherence to local regulations. It's also one of the first exchanges to abide by tough economic restrictions imposed on Russia as a result of its invasion of Ukraine. \n\nDespite this, Binance's regulatory journey has not always been easy. Due to increased scrutiny from the financial watchdog, the exchange had to shut down operations in Canada's most populated province.",
