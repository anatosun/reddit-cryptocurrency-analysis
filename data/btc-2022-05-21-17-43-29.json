Golly, it would take months to buy that much BCH. That's about how much moves on chain in 5 weeks. \n\nI hope it wasn't loaned to some poor sap trying to suppress the price, because if BCH spiked to $1M before they closed their short position, they would have a $1T liability. And they probably also would have lost their facility to borrow more coins they don't have.",
