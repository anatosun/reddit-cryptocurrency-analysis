            "selftext": "Utility tokens are digitised tokens that are developed from the ground up and are not backed by any physical or digital asset.\n\nUtility tokens differ from other cryptocurrencies in that they cannot be mined and rely on the existing blockchain. The widely recognised ERC and TRC token standards are the most widely used for creating utility tokens. Many crypto startups prefer ERC20 and TRC20 for utility token development because they are built on popular networks like Ethereum and Tron. However, there are a number of other tokens that can be beneficial when invested in. \n\nThey are as follows:\nBinance USD\nUniswap\nBob eco coin\nChain link\n\nAnother project that helps humans in Africa is the bob eco coin. This is a fresh face on the scene! Tens of thousands of jobs have been created as a result of the world of Security Tokens and their use of EVs.\n\n\nThis is what the token utility and the product itself have in stock. This is a good example of a good utility that will undoubtedly drive token demand. It will be implemented in the near future, and the token's dollar price is still very low, putting it in a very good position as an investment opportunity.\n\nOf course, this is one of the few utility tokens that has or will have good utility in the future, ensuring a bright future for the token and its holders.",
