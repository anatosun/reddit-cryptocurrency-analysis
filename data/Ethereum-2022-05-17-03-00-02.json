The shadow forks functioned as expected, meaning there weren't errors. Maybe I'm misunderstanding and you're just pointing out that just because there haven't been errors in the forks, doesn't mean there won't be mainnet errors that werent uncovered in the shadow forks? Which, yeah, of course that's always possible\n\nThe shadow forks represent a lot more than just turning it on and making sure it's possible. Since they're shadow forks of mainnet, that means all transactions on mainnet (even *after* the fork happens) will also happen on the fork. That's pretty solid real world testing imo",
