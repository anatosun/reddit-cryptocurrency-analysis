            "selftext": "I use Electrum. I was supposed to send someone 150 USD worth of BTC two weeks ago. \n\nAnd I did. At least I'm pretty sure I remember writing 150 in the Fiat portion of the interface, and letting Electrum calculate whatever the equivelent is in BTC (and then filling out the \"Detail\" section with a unique ID name) and sending that for a medium transfer price (probably, whatever 20-50 sat/byt was worth at the time \u2013 that's usually around the zone I stay for my transfers).\n\nNow, two weeks later, the receiver tells me I sent him 135 USD, as opposed to 150. I'm really not the type to try to get away with tricking anyone, so I'd like to find out what happened here. There are a few options I can think of:\n\na) The receiver never really looked closely at the transfer I sent him two weeks ago, and now that the BTC value has steadily declined over the last couple of weeks, whatever I sent him then, is today worth 135 USD. \n\n* This is the most likely reason. The only thing weird part about this option is that he asks for a screenshot of the transfer from my side when I send it to him, so you'd think he's the type to check these things closely \u2013 and if I sent too little, it would be more natural for him to mention it then. Not two weeks later.\n\nb) I accidently had \"Fiat\" set to Euro, and wrote 150 in Euro, as opposed to dollars. \n\n* It's very rare I have \"Fiat\" set to Euro, but maybe this was one of the few times I did, and I forgot to change it back. \n\nWell, i guess that's it. I don't remember what other possible causes I thought of. \n\nIn any case: does anybody know a site I can use to check what a specific Fiat amount was worth in BTC for a specific day? Or does anybody know what 150 USD roughly was equl to in BTC during the last couple of days of April? \\[I tried Googling this, but didn't seem to find anything other than charts of what 1 BTC was worth for any given time\\].",

Theres 1.3m still up for grab on exchanges - wouldn't these have all been scooped up by now?\n\nBut again, at the end of the day you're talking to \"retail\" who'd rather FOMO into a hype.\n\nIf BTC becomes mainstream then BTC will be adopted into their lives no doubt, like cell phones or online shopping. But frontrunning an opportunity however requires someone to invest time and effort as well as money.\n\nAgain, no one would ever consider it \"too late\" to invest in the S&P500.

According to Kraken, an external consultant regularly verifies that their Bitcoin stash is 100% of the Bitcoin balances on their customers' accounts. Kraken is the only exchange which warns customers not to keep coins in an exchange account, encourages everybody to withdraw to a personal wallet  \n\nIf other exchanges (Coinbase?) are fractional, they could have fixed that several years ago when we first began asking for proof of keys here",

Recall 2017/2018 and the crash that wiped out tons of bad projects/coins.  A couple stablecoins with BTC reserves failing would lead to them dumping BTC on the market (OP: this would **drive BTC price down**, not up, just a friendly reminder).  Most coins are correlated with BTC and take the dives even harder, so it would cause them to dump as well.  Some would not recover.\n\nWe will end 2022 with fewer scam coins, fewer redundant coins, more consolidation in terms of market dominance for the top 20 coins, and best of all: a more savvy audience.  Large groups have been fooled with scams now **3 times** \\- 2013, 2017/18, and since 2021 Jan to right now.  Each time we learn.  Don't use crypto like a house swap.  Don't use it for 10/100x get-rich-quick schemes.\n\nInvest in projects as if you are an angel investor in a startup - do your due diligence and put money down if you actually think the damn thing **solves a problem** and is **useful**.  Even then for god's sake don't put everything in a company (to further the analogy) that's been around 3 months with a dodgy CEO waxing poetic about Web3 and a \"nonprofit foundation\" that de facto governs the whole fucking thing.\n\nAlso ask yourself if you'd invest in a \"startup\" where e.g. 70% of the stock was sold at $1/share and you're buying it now for $100 per, but there has been no new development/product/deliverable between that seed and your round.  Think long and hard about that investment.  Because that's what you are doing when you buy premined coins.  If the coin doesn't have a differentiating value prop in the market, it can only go one way.",

I compared this to a hash rate chart of the last twelve years and came to the conclusion that your theory doesn't match objective facts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn all seriousness though, yes in twenty, fifty, one hundred years tx fees should make up a greater proportion of mining reward. The hope is that small tx will take place over lightning where only routing fees are paid, but otherwise making an onchain tx on the base layer will be costly, as it should be. This should encourage second and third layer solutions. Personally I'd like the base layer to remain transparent and expensive so only very large tx use layer one. Paying for a cup of coffee should of course be done over lightning, which is designed specifically for regular small tx between stakeholders.",

                    "response": "Assuming that your effective tax rate are the same now and in retirement Roth and Traditional provide the same economic benefit. Roth has better inheritance rules.\n\nIf you're currently at low tax rates that is a big argument in favor of Roth, since it's more likely that you'll have higher tax rates in retirement than you do now and less likely that you'll have lower even lower in retirement.\n\nBut even if you have high tax rates now roth can be pretty attractive: because the limits are post tax roth effectively has a higher limit. Even converting an existing traditional account to roth (and paying the taxes out of pocket) effectively increases its size.  People with high tax rates tend to have enough income that they can max out the limits. So roth can still provide more total benefit even if you're paying higher taxes now than in retirement, simply because it increases the limit-- a lower percentage benefit due to paying more taxes but a greater total benefit.\n\nPeople with high incomes are also more likely to be able to pass on their roth to heirs, making the improved inheritance rules matter more.  Though of all roth's benefits the better inheritance treatment is probably the one most politically vulnerable.\n\nI think there are pretty good reasons to expect tax rates to be higher in the future too, which favors roth...  and if they're not, well then you won't need the extra gains as much. :)\n\nIn summary:  Low taxes now: Roth.  High taxes and hitting the retirement account limits: Roth.  High taxes now and not hitting the limits: What are you doing with your life? hit the limits ... then use Roth. :P  Use traditional if you're pretty confident that you'll have lower taxes in requirement that can't be offset by higher effective limits. (And double check the [US debt clock]( https://www.usdebtclock.org/) before you decide that you're confident about low taxes in retirement.)\n\nIn some special cases, like if you expect to have much lower income prior to retirement age (e.g. planning to retire early) using traditional can be adventitious to bank up assets to roll over at minimal tax rates during those low income years. Though the advantage of the expansion doesn't happen until you do the rollover, so this mostly only applies if the lower income years are not too far in the future.  Be aware: Rollovers may have special considerations around asset protection depending on your state, 401k accounts have better protection in some states than IRAs. (I know you were asking about trad/roth ira, but since I mentioned converting...)\n\nAs far as Bitcoin goes,  personally I think Bitcoin is better held outside of a retirement account in a cold wallet:  Many of bitcoin's benefits are only realized if you self custody--  money that is difficult to [seize](https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1525412379269513218), difficult to freeze, highly portable, accepted all over the world, possible to make extremely robust against loss or theft...  You don't get those benefits with it in a custodial retirement account.  Bitcoin is also *extremely* tax efficient: it pays no dividends (except for scamcoin spinoffs, and there is good reason to not expect many of those in the future), and may become even more tax efficient in the future if any of those bills allowing spending small amounts without paying taxes on gains eventually pass.  For the moment Bitcoin also in effect has advantageous wash sale rules.\n\nYou should consider the total composition of assets that you want to hold and put the least tax efficient assets in the tax advantaged accounts first and only once you've done as much of those as you can assign more tax efficient assets and assets that might better be done another way (e.g. bitcoin due to self custody reasons).\n\nIf your investment plan is Bitcoin only without any more traditional investments,  then I think it's fair to say that your undiversified risk is a much bigger consideration than any roth/traditional question. (And no, other 'cryptos' are not diversification vs Bitcoin).",

Realize that it's basically a leveraged bitcoin play, so its price is much more volatile than bitcoin's price is. My last limit order that executed was at $150 on Thursday, and MSTR closed at $204.57 on Friday. That's how nuts it is. Definitely not for weak hands. My advice: watch it closely, and buy when you see it's down 25% on the day. Believe me, that happens. It's a wild ride. Buckle up and have fun!",

I went traditional - for stocks.\n\nAnd for bitcoin didn't do an IRA, just cold storage.\n\nBUT  - bitcoin, in retrospect, would have been good in a Roth IRA. Because then I would get taxed putting the money in, and then NOT get taxed - at all - when selling the bitcoin getting the money out. In hindsight, it would have been cool to have the IRS pound sand when it came to getting taxes.\n\nThat said, I also think that things like the Roth IRA are going to change after Peter Thiel / Palantir founder put seed stocks into his Roth IRA and they've grown in value to $5 bil + that he doesn't have to pay taxes on. The govt wants that sweet sweet money, and they will scheme to get it.",

That means, make sure the paper is not laying around somewhere where someone could take a photo of it, the words themselves are never entered in an unsafe electronic device which might have spyware and so on. \n\nHardware wallets are just devices that generate this private key and are designed so they never reveal it - except one time when you set them up, so you can make a backup of the key in form of a number of words that can be used to reconstruct the key in case the device breaks. So using a hardware wallet correctly helps you keep the electronic copy of the key on a safe device. You just need to take care your written down copy doesn\u2019t get compromised.",

He quoted silly money to try, which at the time was more than the BTC's value, so I didn't go ahead. \n\nTimes have changed of course, but now considering the value I'm paranoid about them keeping what's found and telling me it was too far gone. Of course it could be gone if the wallet data is in a badly damaged area on the platter.\nThe other worry is that it's not had any power to the drive for over 11 years, so maybe data decay? It's a tough situation.",

The Fed influences USD which is going to directly influence every single USD market. Why would BTC-USD be an exception?\n\nWhenever you have a question about prices, think about it in terms of markets. Because markets are usually where prices come from.\n\nEven if nothing changes about the \"BTC\" side of the market, if the \"USD\" side changes then the market price is going to change.\n\nAnd we're only talking about some of the more direct effects. The reality is we're in a global economy. No market is an island. No trade can be made in isolation. Everything has an effect on everything else. If you trade Euros for cocoa beans in Ecuador, there's going to be a butterfly effect in the Japanese auto market.\n\nOther markets such as BTC-EUR are even more directly influenced by USD manipulation, because there are immediate arbitrage opportunities when BTC-USD changes.\n\nSo now you see that it is a completely unrealistic expectation that the manipulation of a fiat currency would not have an effect on crypto markets. And we're not talking about the manipulation of just any currency; we're talking about the Fed influencing the US dollar, a hugely important currency in global markets. Obviously that's going to have an effect.",

Amazon roping you in to using an Amazon card is profitable for Amazon, even with their rewards.\n\nYou think not accepting credit cards is an increase in profit for merchants?

First off, tax law varies by jurisdiction, so the only way to get an accurate answer is to speak to an accountant in your jurisdiction. I\u2019ve spoken to one in mine, and he told me that there is no clear answer to this question, and that the only certainty is that capital gains apply to crypto-to-fiat transactions. Fwiw I\u2019m in Canada. There are lots of opinions, but they\u2019re just that - opinions. The tax code is a many thousands of pages long behemoth, intentionally written to be opaque by the dishonest scum we call politicians; no person alive has read it all, and the fact that we must pay \u2018experts\u2019 to tell is how to comply with a body of law renders that body of law immoral and illegitimate. I personally couldn\u2019t care less about what\u2019s legal, I care about what\u2019s right. \n\nIn any event, unless you\u2019re a top tax code expert in your jurisdiction, and I\u2019m not, you don\u2019t *know* the answer, you\u2019re just repeating what you\u2019ve read or been told.",

            "selftext": "People talking about how they move their \"dollar cost average\" by buying at any price. Surely will bring me a kto of downvotes, but maybe some people start thinking and stop coping. \n\nSure, when you know that it is likely to increase in value and after a dip it will probably go back up, that's not the worst idea.\n\nBut that is the problem with Btc and crypto in general. Why should it go up? You can make the case that it has a set amount that could be mined. If it's actually used as a payment method, it's value just increases with inflation, since you would always get the same amount of goods for 1 Btc and therefore the price of Btc has to increase.\n\nBut that's nothing you would DCA for, you would just buy it in times of high inflation and sell it during deflation.\n\nDCA wouldn't really hurt if you still do it, would it?\n\nIf that is how crypto works, you would be about 10% up since last year. Are you? No, cause acceptance of crypto payment is still low af, transactions are slow and nobody uses it anyway.\n\nSo you might not DCA the currency Btc, but you could invest, right? You can do it with a company, why not with btc?\n\nThere is literally no value to it, except for a more privacy. That's nothing to underestimate. Sadly, most people aren't more anonymous than they are with their banking account, since most people do it the easy way, using coinbase or similar stuff. Privacy is not really their concern.\n\nHas it been a save haven at any point in history? It outperformed many indices, but in times of trouble, nobody was rushing into Btc, rather the other way around.\n\nBut it's price is high, so it just increase in value for some reason.\n\nWhenever speculation was high and price moved during times of slow news, media started hyping it. But with the environmental stuff going on, increasing difficulty to mine and Russia allegedly using it to finance its war and so on, I don't know if there is enough willingness to hype it again and if so, whether there are enough people interested in it.\n\nIf there is any reason for it to actually increase in value, except for the only purpose to sell your bags to someone who is dumber than you, please share it with me.\n\nPlease don't try to tell me it should have the same worth as all dollar on circulation combined. If the smallest unit of Btc (0,000...1 Btc) equals one penny, just do the math yourself... \n\nPersonally, I think the hype is dying and there will be many bagholders left. Lost Btc will over time make Btc more and more unusable, unless it gets regulated heavily, which will make it just as flawed as fiat currency.",

You are also not understanding what DCA is, on account of the former perspective.\n\nBitcoin is not a get-rich-quick scheme.  There is no sense in timing the market, as we're not trying to dump at 3x or something.  Inflation in USD is only part of the story with respect to BTC (or any crypto) price anyway, so looking purely at that as an entry point is misleading.\n\nInstead, we buy BTC to, over time, convert our work/energy from fiat - which loses 3% or more value *every year*, regardless - to something with better monetary properties.  If BTC goes down 10% one year, sure the short time horizon looks bad, but **we can't time the market**.  Nobody knows how to do this.  So you DCA.  Over time, as you can see from BTC's price vs USD, we get a great conversion rate.  And it is just that - **conversion rate**.  It's a one way street.\n\nDCA also protects you emotionally.  If you try to guess the market, you will of course enter too early/late for a \"bottom\".  You might kick yourself for doing this.  You might stare at charts until your eyes bleed trying to spot the inverse T-Rex pattern.  So you take the decision away completely and say rather than 100% at some vague time, 5% every week for a year.\n\nIt is also not just disingenuous, but simply a failure at math to even attempt to suggest that BTC is worse than fiat currency as a \"safe haven\".  Almost every year without fail it has gone up miles higher than the value of e.g. USD.  A mere **2% increase** YOY would be enough to be on par with fiat.  Instead we see 2x, which is **100% increase**.  You would need 3 years of -20% following that to be in the same state as fiat.  And that would just wipe out the 1 year of 2x, and we've had many years of much, much higher.\n\nTo make the math easy for you - **$100** (year 1) -> $200 (2x year 2) -> $160 -> $128 -> **$102.4** (3 years of 20% drawdown, ending just slightly lower than 2% YOY inflation on $100)",

It\u2019s a risk you take because the banks will only give you 0.5% per year.  You need to invest to grow your money, most use the stock market or buy real estate but there is risk there as well.  Imagine trying to retire during this down market.  \n\nBitcoin is digital money secured by software. It\u2019s slow but it doesn\u2019t need to be fast.  The value comes from its set supply (no money printing) and security and difficulty to change.  It\u2019s like a granite foundation that can be built upon with faster layers (lightening network) to process transactions.  The reason it\u2019s price is high now is because it\u2019s the king of crypto and dominates at what it does.  Think Amazon of online sales.  People believe bitcoin will be the Amazon of crypto in 10 or 20 years.  At least that\u2019s what I think.\n\nI can\u2019t guess if this is the bottom so DCA is the most practical way to get bitcoin at an average price, not too high or low. The thought is in 10 years it won\u2019t matter if you paid $20K or $40k when it\u2019s at $150k or $300k. Some say $1M, who knows.  Bitcoin is the first so it has a head start on all copycats and has the largest network of believers that make it strong.",

Based on its current technical status,  Btc already can work as a store of value. But, of course, price is not decided by technical facts but buyers and sellers. If too few people don't believe BTC is here to stay, the price will decline or, eventually, even zero.\n\nOn the long run, if enough people remain believers, the price increases soley by inflation and lost coins. However, currently, we are in an adoption process which shows higher price increase rates than inflation. Also markets are still pretty thin leading to high volatility. Both counteracts the concept of store of value. \n\nThev question is what do think in future will be. You are not on the believer group, which is ok. So DCA doesn't make sense. But being in the believer group, DCA makes totally sense. But, of course, it's also gambling on the future.",

Well then, why would price of ANY investment go up then? The fundamental of value is how people wants it. People are tired of having their money controlled by governments and we want a fair medium not distorted by authorities to store value. That\u2019s the value of Bitcoin.\n\nPeople pay for what they want. Give you an example, Chanel has raised prices of their products 6 times within last 12 months. My gf just sold one of her Chanel bags she used for more than a year, at a price higher than she bought it. So why people still buy? Becos they want it. Simple.\n\nInvest in company stocks? Look at the top companies in your NYSE, guess you can see all of them are going digital or in such business. Look, we are already in 2022, things are digital now and people have been talking about metaverse, a world that you are go to work, sitting virtually next to your colleague, chatting with someone you don\u2019t know virtually meet you in the virtual bar, without travel time and city lockdowns. Do you still think people have to do foreign exchange to buy that virtual drink to chat?\n\nAt 8% inflation, people want to control their own wealth more; as the world evolve and increasing globalization, people need a common currency for FX free transactions.\n\nIt took 7 years for EU to push forward to launch EURO, a common currency within a region of countries which the governments still have certain degree to control; so of cos it will take longer for Bitcoin to be the common currency of the world.\n\nI know where you get your point of view from, I\u2019m not a 19 yo here. I have stocks and I have properties in many countries, but those will not be how values are viewed soon. We move on and valuation evolves. \n\nFYI, I cannot include any references which are more than 5 years if I want my next paper to be published in any economic or business journal, as those are considered as outdated.",

But they can create their own CBDC and remove some of the disadvantages the US dollar has. At the end of the day, governments can make it far easier for people to onboard their CBDC and make certain key features only available through their CBDC like getting stimulus checks. I'm not American so I don't know what other things you got going on.  \n\n\n>No central government token can accomplish what Bitcoin has organically.

But I just don't see it becoming the one main currency of Humanity. Only the future can tell of course. The point isn't to replicate Bitcoin it's to create a superior form of currency by learning from existing technologies and innovating.

It needs way more global exposure so it can stabilize and become useful as that medium of exchange. Once it finds some kind of stability it will become much easier to argue that it shouldn\u2019t be cap gains taxed. If that can be done, it doesn\u2019t matter if fiat exists. Eventually people will simply hold the smarter money.\n\nOne step at a time, but let\u2019s not get the mindset that we can never turn Bitcoin into global money. It CAN be done.

Will it eventually confirm? Tomorrow will be the 4th day.\n\nThanks!",

Of course she goes to energy use. But as we know bitcoin uses stranded energy because it\u2019s the cheapest.\n\nFrom an economics perspective Paul Krugman and Peter Schiff have differing opinions on why bitcoin is dumb but they come to the same conclusion. I for one think Peter Schiff is probably just pretending to hate on bitcoin cause gold bugs who don\u2019t understand bitcoin are starting to die off.",

After about 30 minutes, I saw the transaction finalized in my hardware wallet's dashboard. \n\nHowever, when I moved the rest (thousands of dollars), the transaction finalized within a couple minutes. \n\nI am curious why such a big difference in the time to finalize the transaction. \n\nIs this by design?  Do larger amounts get precedence? Or is it just luck?",

But the mining difficulty always adjusts every 2016 blocks so that a 10 minute average block interval is maintained. This is a part of the protocol.\n\nIt also depends on how many sats per virtual bye were paid for the transaction fee. But Coinbase always pays a a good transaction fee. So it just comes down to how long before a block gets solved in this case.",

With big amounts I am talking about total sums of everything around 3000\u20ac-4000\u20ac worth of btc. This may not be big amounts for other people, but it is what I consider big :) This is good for my profit, but got me thinking about my responsibility with regards to the law.\n\nSo lets say one or two users consistently buy these amounts from me everyday. Can I be held accountable if they are using my btc for money laundering or other criminal purposes?\n\nThe sites I am talking about have KYC, so the users have verified their names with ID or passport. And the payment method they choose is not anonymous either, I can clearly see that the names from the P2P platforms match the deposit.\n\nSo what are my responsibilities and do I need to verify them further if they have already been verified by the platform?",

Obviously this whole thing provides just an excellent point of FUD to be talked about, rambled on, distorted and disingenuously applied to Bitcoin, etc. etc....will it all work? Will they be able to pin this whole collapse on Bitcoin and demonize hodlers? Or will it provide cover to regulate to the point of banning, Bitcoin? (See how volatile and dangerous these cryptos are, let's ban them all)\n\nThat's the important question, IMO. How this event will be used as a football, by the oligarchy, to try to attack Bitcoin, and furthermore how uninformed ignorant masses will believe and go along with it. What do you think on this.",

Now these \"genious\" people are selling Bitcoin because some ponzi altcoin schemes collapsed and because stock markets are crashing. They are dead wrong again. A reality check will happen later.

Originally, they promised to back every USDT with 1 USD on deposit in a bank account, and publish a monthly external audit proving the fiat bank account deposits  \n\nThey refused to allow the auditor access to the bank accounts, and he quit  \n\nThen it became apparent that they had lost money, Tether was no longer 100% backed, and they wouldn't admit it  \n\nStuff happened, a lawsuit discovered that the bank deposit backing was 74%, and the rest was \"other assets\". The other assets were loans, and it was discovered that they were loans to related parties - not real assets  \n\nThe settlement of the lawsuit disclosed that Tether had been using customer deposits to fund its operations, and imposed ongoing disclosure. The ongoing disclosure has been incomplete. What has been disclosed shows about 18% in bank deposits, a substantial amount in cash-like assets (government and commercial bonds which trade freely), and the remainder in loans to related parties  \n\nTether is less than 100% backed. But Tether holds its USD1.00 peg for as long as Tether the company redeems USD Tether tokens for USD1.00. They've never failed to do this, because there has never been a run on redemptions",

Literally everyone knows this though, you are not some kind of genius.. people are making fun of you because you think you invented something extremely trivial. Also. it is not risk free, there is a very high risk you miss the timing, then you are left with nothing of value. Depending on what you buy when the price is high. Cash is obviously not a great investment. Most people dont follow the market, it takes way too much time and resources",

There is your timing number 2: 'When people begin over reacting. I buy.'. Not everyone has the capacity to watch these things, and worry. It is much less risk free to just invest long term and not trade at all for 99% or people. Do you understand now what timing means? Or should I get your toddler to explain it to you. I mean how stupid do you have to be to deny that there is any timing involved and then in the next sentence you type down what are the last few timings lol. Some people.. you are basically describing alpha trading, and it is much easiert with bitcoin because it both has a 4 year rythm with the issuance, and most of the time follows sp500, and when it doesnt it can be instantly identified as an opportunity",

There will be innovations in security, functionality, and of course in usability. It's already very easy to use bitcoin in a custodial manner, and I would say it's easy to use in a non-custodial manner too. It will continue to get easier.",

He explained that he will wait for BTC to test the bottom, which he believes will be around $17,000, before starting to buy. \"The best moments to get money are during crashes,\" he recommended.\n\nThe author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad announced in January that he would buy additional bitcoin \"if and when BTC tests $20K.\"\nThe acclaimed author predicted the largest bubble implosion last month. The government, Wall Street, and the Federal Reserve were all referred to as \"thieves\" by him. He also predicted hyperinflation and depression, advising investors to purchase gold, silver, and bitcoin.\n\n\nI agree with the Rich Dad Poor Dad author has I think Bitcoin's  value is more than just it's market valuation.\nThe cryptocurrency is innovative and it's is preferable to fiat. Bitcoin is more secure, easily transferable, decentralized. \n Bitcoin will be an integral part of global institutional finance has we have seen more and government and financial institutions adopt the cryptocurrency. \n\nAlso if one takes a look at the metaverse and the block chain ecosystem which is steadily developing with innovative projects such as Luckyblock which  is a digital asset project that decentralizies the lottery process via blockchain technology, Planet Maya which is powered by champions games is  a decentralized and collaborative online casino which allows developers to build Games around betting, Silks a blockchain-based metaverse that enables users to own, trade, and profit from thoroughbred racing horses. I think Blockchain technology will revolutionize our civilization just like the internet did which makes Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more important has the Blockchain ecosystem utilizes cryptocurrencies for transactions. \n \nI think when you really do understand Bitcoin and Blockchain technology and the impact it will have on our society on a global scale it will be silly to sell Bitcoin because of  price fluctuations.",

Writing them on paper or stamping/etching them into metal are common. These words **are** access to that wallet. You'll need these in the event your device gets lost or breaks.\n\nWhen you're moving crypto, sending a small test transaction is advisable.

The economic push of forgiveness has already been stolen (pushed) by the moratorium.\nUltra cheap money is the cause of higher tuition as well as \"permanent students\" as well as Starbucks baristas with Masters degrees.\nWhat about future students, free tuition? Too bad for them? What about present students can they add to there debt load? Can they prepay for 10more years?\nThe situation is very complex and the \"forgiveness\" plan is meant to divide and distract Americans from fundamental problems of having a broken economy.....BTC fixes this",

Some dismissed it. Some didn't understand it.\n\nSound familiar with Bitcoin?\n\nBut imagine Facebook from the get go had said they would limit accounts to 21 million.\n\nEventually even though it's hated by many one billion people (about 15% of the worlds population) want an account....but there is only 21 million accounts.\n\nImagine how much early adoptors could have sold their accounts for?\n\nMaybe the comparison falls down as Facebook accounts can't be split up like one bitcoin can, but I still like the comparison.\n\nOr I maybe talking bollocks..",

It stops at national borders? Most American leftists compare their situations to the rich but never the poor in other countries. In Guatemala most people live on $2-3 a day. Why not see the entire picture when raging against privilege and corporations? \n\nFurthermore everyhing in their entire world from their shoes to their hair gel, their bed, their phone, their house, their car, their city, and every sub-componant of all of those things is made by a corporation and they willingling give up their money... voluntarily... to get those things.... and then complain about getting fucked?!??\n\nI just do not get how the framing is allowed to be so narrow and silly in what they consider.",

What *entire group* do you know of (besides maybe the core set of Bitcoiners) that can understand the fundamentals of geopolitics? People are inherently capable of observing the world around them. It requires time, interest, and dedication to sift through the broad spectrum of information and opinions about the world outside of their local community.\n\nEveryone can see rising housing prices. Everyone can see a rising percent of their paycheck going to monthly expenses. Not everyone can see how nations dependent on foreign currencies are being exploited by a foreign inflationary supply shock to the global economy they are selling goods into.\n\nPeople generally know that people are making $3 a day in other countries and they don't like it. But the narratives they hear are:\n\n1. The country has an exploitive government that keeps them poor. The US *tries* to help but the government is just so corrupt!\n2. Civil war, cultural upheaval, or some other unforeseen event has destroyed their economy.\n\nThere's some varying degrees of truth to these statements and there's not much to do about them from the perspective of a US citizen.\n\n\"I guess I can donate $10 a month to feed a family or send a child to school or some shit.\"\n\nHow can a population who's only meaningful contribution to federal politics is voting between two nothing burgers once every 4 years take into account monetary policy and foreign geopolitical events? What is the action item that opens up to them if they do build an informed opinion on all of these global issues?\n\nIt's not just left leaning folk who don't take the broader world into account either. Everyone has their retirement in a 401k or some other form of stock indexes. The fact that the entire US retirement budget is subsidizing big public corporations is the crime here. Especially since the ones managing those funds are taking their massive cut along the way.\n\nWhere do you shop? Do you somehow avoid all major grocery stores, wall-mart, target, etc.?  If you do, it likely means you can afford to spend a bit more. Most people are practically forced to feed corporate businesses a huge chunk of their wages.\n\nYou can't really blame people for not voting with their dollar. Outside of Bitcoin, it's practically impossible to vote with your dollar.",

Forgive me if it is also a naive one!  \n\n\nSo, Bob and Motown Coffee set up a lightning channel. Bob funds it with 1000 sats. There is now a multisig wallet, which Bob and Motown Coffee own together. Motown is selling coffees for 100 sats each. Bob buys 10 coffees over the course of two weeks, using up all 1000 of his sats. In an ideal world, both parties sign off on it, and the new balance gets reflected to their original wallets on chain, with Motown Coffee now having those 1000 sats from the multisig.  \n\n\nBut! What if Bob is a complete asshole? What if Bob thinks... \"well, my 1000 sats already left my wallet when I funded the multisig, and I have none remaining on the channel to be sent back to me. I already got my 10 coffees, so I gain nothing by signing off and closing the channel. Screw you Motown Coffee, neither of us are getting those sats!\" Wouldn't those sats essentially be stuck in the multisig wallet until Bob has a change of heart? And if Bob never has a change of heart, are those sats just locked forever?  \n\n\nI'm hoping there is some technical solution to this. If not, then it seems like the only recourse for this type of action is for Motown Coffee to ban Bob as a customer, which might work for large chains, but if a mischievous traveler is going through a town and stops at a small mom and pop coffee shop, why would they care if they're banned from the shop? I can see where, if Bob still had some sats left on the channel, he'd have incentive to get back his remainder. But if the funder has already spent everything they funded the multisig wallet with, is \"let's be nice to each other\" the only thing keeping sats from getting stuck in the channel?  \n\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking this? Maybe companies will only allow you to fund a channel up to an amount they're comfortable losing, and rely on on-chain transactions for any large purchases? I just want to make sure I'm not missing something simple here",

Looking forward to reading through the entire page.\n\nJust to confirm I understand it, if the channel is timelocked, each party essentially agrees to that timelock when it is opened/funded. So Bob knows going into it that the channel will eventually be closed, either by both parties agreeing to it or by a timelock elapsing, because he agreed to the timelock when the channel opened.  \n\n\nEDIT: Sorry, I re-read your comment. It's not necessarily the entire channel that's timelocked, but each individual transaction (coffee purchase in the above example).",

So Motown Coffee can close the channel but the sats wont be spendable until X hours or days later (whatever length time timelock was agreed to when the channel opened).\n\nThe timelock is there so in case one channel partner force closes the channel with an old channel state. Say Bob spent his money then decides \"I'll close the channel now in an old state where I had the money!\". Well then while it's time locked, Motown Coffee can broadcast a more up to date channel closure state with the proper balance reflected.",

I think the Ledger Live software allows you to connect to a local (meaning, on the same computer) Bitcoin Core. If Live doesn't allow that directly, you'll need an additional software such as Specter.",

Thanks for any input or comments folks! If you drop your wallet address below, I will send you some sats to fund your new wallet and to try out the site more fully. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Depending on response level, I will have to stop at some point with distributing free sats.

This is very difficult to do and there are many safeguards however it's one reason only to loop out SATs with either a very well connected node that's long established with good track record or someone you trust.\n\nAlways creat multiple local channel backups so you can easily restore your node if it ever crashes, no problem.\n\nSo in short, the answer to your question is there's always risk but in this case the risk is so miniscule it's only barely worth noting. But the reward is also miniscule so if that is your motivation you will be disappointed. The best motivation and use case is to help secure decentralization in the network and be connected to whatever merchants you normally interact with. For example, I regularly buy SATs off strike and send to my wallet; being connected to Acinq directly is cheaper than if I were going through multiple midpoints to do so, driving the percentage fee cost up slightly.",

In the past 24 hours, it's increased due to a lot of activity, but it's likely to drop down again. There's also a delay when sending funds before they've arrived with enough confirmations to be used.\n\nSo if you trade regularly, it might be better to leave the coins you use to trade on the exchange.

Newton said it himself, every force has an equal and opposite reaction and I think crypto is becoming one of the stronger forces while the markets are closed.\n\nLots of algorithmic trading these days and Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate reducing is seeing the asset class as a whole become less volatile and more valuable as time progresses.\n\nWhether or not you think crypto will make you significantly wealthier over the next decade, the first thing to notice is that crypto is here to stay for sure (at least Bitcoin is for sure). The technology on offer is revolutionary and invites a fresh take on the economic principles that we have been acquainted with since the banks first propped up. \n\nThere is value in the idea. And as more people get accustomed to crypto becoming more mainstream, it\u2019s gonna be more and more common to see a correlation with stocks as the people trading stocks also trade crypto with a similar market sentiment. This is particularly true and evident when the macroeconomic trends are blindingly obvious like right now.\n\nI\u2019m of the opinion that the current drop is the market pricing in the inevitable rate hikes. We\u2019re in for a hell of an accumulation phase. Don\u2019t forget that before the next true bull run the technology will only continue to improve and lots more will be on offer next time.\n\nNever before has continuing to stack those fucking sats been more important. \n\nFire sale of the cycle boys.",

You see, the value of bitcoin is a function of long-term network participants, not traders or speculators. They are a part of every health market and that is fine, but it was traders and speculators that brought bitcoin up to $60k+ and not a healthy movement.\n\nSo why did bitcoin crash? Because the hype died down, markets went south. People got margin calls, had to sell assets. One of the sectors with the most leverage was crypto. Remember the \"I take a loan on my house\" threads? Well, if people with close to zero financial education do that and enter with leverage, thing eventually go tits up at some point. Bitcoin is up several 100% over the last couple of years. It performed extremely well against all other assets and is holding up extremely well. Yes it is down 60% from ATH. But it is still massively up against its past. Long-term effects however are obscured by short-term speculation and leverage. And that's the bubble that popped. This is good for bitcoin.",

There are too many factors involved in both realized inflation and the adoption of Bitcoin that the volatility is greatly detached in the short and medium term.\n\nBut let's be clear, you've experienced inflation every year of your life (regardless of how old you are). Bitcoin has gone up in value over the lifetime of Bitcoin. It has hedged inflation and much more (due to adoption) over its lifetime.\n\nIf you'd been paying attention, people in Bitcoin have been talking about incoming inflation for the last 2 years. This means that the inflation play was front run before inflation actually got here in a really bad way. Now you're experiencing the pull back as people realize that very successful play.\n\nAnyone who thinks about the various factors going into Bitcoin would instantly realize that the inflation narrative can only be over the long term\u2013not as a direct response to last months inflation numbers.",

Its how they maintain power and essentially enslave us via taxation. Print more money for their agendas to get re elected to avoid the unpopular direct tax and hide the tax via inflation.  \n\nThe world needs more young, Austrian economy type leader such as el Salvador. \n\n The name of the game is to keep the world on usd standard as to export inflation to other countries to fuel the war machine. And unfortunately countries hold large amounts of usd, and usd based financial assets so they have intrest in keeping usd king.\n\nIts a good thing el Salvador doesn't have any valuable commodities.  Anyone remember when Gaddafi said lybia was going to back their currency with gold and sell their oil in their currency.\n\nIn conclusion large economies will fight tooth and nail to keep btc down. We will need a major political shift to change things.  Unfortunately the kind of political shift such as burning the world down and starting over.\n\nMy two cents",

Everything that came before, including Gaddafi's gold-backed money, had to operate on the legacy rails to be useful as money. States had the home turf in money competitions, but not with Bitcoin. It brought its own rails. And those rails go to every country, and every last poor person with a smartphone.\n2. The dollar's dominance is falling fast without bitcoin's influence. Russia, China, and India are already ending the petrodollar as we speak, although it may take a decade for the Yuan to rise against it and take the title. Satoshi couldn't have timed Bitcoin's rise any better if he tried and that's why many keep alive the joke of him being a time traveller.",

In 2015, he was sentenced to life in prison without parole. His appeal was denied, as was the pardon he sought from President Trump. But a little over a year ago, it appears Ulbricht finally got a break of a different kind: The nine-figure debt he owed to the US government as part of his sentence will be erased\u2014all thanks to the fortuitous hoarding of a hacker who'd stolen a massive trove of bitcoins from his market.\n\nLast year, prosecutors quietly signed an agreement with Ulbricht stipulating that a portion of a newfound trove of Silk Road bitcoins, seized from an unnamed hacker, will be used to cancel out the more than $183 million in restitution Ulbricht was ordered to pay as part of his 2015 sentence, a number calculated from the total illegal sales of the Silk Road based on exchange rates at the time of each transaction. Despite the fact that the more recently unearthed stash of bitcoins\u2014now worth billions of dollars\u2014was itself criminal proceeds, the Justice Department appears to have made a deal with Ulbricht to avoid any claim he might have made to the money: In exchange for Ulbricht's agreement to waive any ownership he might have of the bitcoins, a portion of them will be used to pay off his restitution in its entirety.\n\n\"The parties agree that the net proceeds realized from the sale of the [bitcoins] forfeited pursuant to this agreement shall be credited toward any unpaid balance of the Money Judgment,\" reads a court filing from last year, using the phrase \"money judgment\" to refer to Ulbricht's 2015 restitution order. The document, filed in February of 2021, is signed by both Ulbricht and David Countryman, a prosecutor in the asset forfeiture unit of the US Attorney's office for the Northern District of California. The Department of Justice didn't respond to WIRED's request for comment.\n\n\nBy the time the nearly 70,000 bitcoins were seized, they had grown to more than $1 billion in value\u2014at the time, the largest ever criminal seizure ever carried out by the Justice Department. (That record has since been broken by the seizure of $3.6 billion from a New York couple accused of laundering the proceeds of the hack of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex.)\n\nIn the time since that seizure, however, court records show that the Justice Department has fought off a series of seemingly frivolous claims to the bitcoins, which prevented it from immediately selling off the coins as it does with other seized cryptocurrency. That resulted in the bitcoins appreciating even more, to nearly $3 billion at current exchange rates. When the coins are eventually sold and that sum is added to the US treasury, it will easily cover Ulbricht's restitution, with billions of dollars to spare.\n\nGoogle is not your friend",

Think of it as a box that has wallets connected to it.\n\nThis magical box can keep track of coins going from one wallet to another. (Not exactly but in roundabout way it does)\n\nThe magic box gets its computational power from \"the network\".  ie miners (fancy computing machines)\n\n\nWhen i send a coin to someone im generating a kinda receipt.    This receipt requires the fancy computers to make sure the correct coins are going to the correct place.\n\nIf Tonys fancy computing machine is the one to sort out where my coins go and process the transaction he gets a portion of a newly minted bitcoin.  This is a reward because poor tony still needs to pay electricity for his computing machine.  Plus his machine aint cheap either.\n\nThis all happens on a large scale, with more nuance.\n\nFun fact: Every mining cycle there is x amount of bitcoin up for grabs.  The amount available per cycle decreases every new cycle... So tony will earn less coins in the future for validating transactions, but seeing as there is an ever decreasing amount of new coins (deflationary) they should in theory be worth more.\n\nSomeone please correct me/ feel free to elaborate\n\nThere are no dumb questions, just dumb answers",

I do have a ledger wallet which I will be sending the BTC I buy from Strike to. I'm planning on hodling for long term. Are there any cons to this? It seems too good to be true with the frequent hourly buys and low fees. I was reading something about spreads and I'm still trying to understand what that means but any thoughts?",

What you'll see with self-custody is an endless trend towards complexity: multisig, substitution cyphers, SeedXOR, Shamir Secrets, FediMint, and now a full blown fork being discussed called BIP119. Nonsense. When you see this complexity, something is wrong. These solutions have purpose for businesses and other situations, but not individuals. Memorizing your seed is a once in a lifetime requirement. What the naysayers forget is that 90% of lost bitcoin would've been avoided if the owners had memorized their seed. It wasn't because they un-memorized or forgot their seed, it's because they relied on contrivances. But as always, **back the seed up** with hard wallets preferably, or with another brain, like your wife. One step further is inheritance, which would involve (in my case) sharing the hard wallet PIN number with loved ones, and they'll have access to it in the bank after my death. I keep two cloned hard wallets in there, just in case one doesn't work for whatever reason. There's also a 7-day timelock after the PIN is entered successfully. This inheritance scheme avoids taxes and probate courts.\n\nBonding your bitcoin to your person as language is the Occam's Razor way, then back it up on hardwallets. Anything more is unnecessary complexity that creates an ever expanding list of attack vectors.\n\nA tornado, fire, flood, police warrants, war, border guards, and theft are all ways you lose access to your bitcoin when written down, stamped, or kept on just hard wallets. Memorize it. Back it up on hard wallets. That's it.",

Congrats you did it all wrong, even if you bought just dipps. Bear market is accumulation part of the cycle not bull. When prices skyrocket everyone wants to get it... they buy... prices go down... they sell... you sholdnt care what everyone else is doing, instead pull an chart for yourself.\n\nKeep in mind:\n- Never invest what you cant afford to lose (funds for house, collage etc) if you know you would need the money forget about investing. Play around with money you know you wont need threw keypoints at life.\n\n- Bitcoin in its cycles even in the deepest bear market never fell below its last cycles all fime high in a new cycles bear. (19k levels rn) (this is a strong rule but can be broken in catastrophic events like usdt dying)\n\n- No one can tell you where price would be, just possibities. Thats why dca (dollar-cost-averaging) is important. Buy no matter where the price is and you should alnost guaranteed to make profit long term.\n\n- Never go all in, that could lead to missing great price oportunities, not to throw money at it but continue dca (you never know whats great price), going all in could end up in you throwing more money than enticipated to \"save yourself\" similarly to gambling, just a 2 more k and il make it back... this leads to stupid decisions and selling at lowst levels to get the money back... which is exactly what big players want. People like this get shaken out by the market.\n\n- Never invest with emotions, market is unpredictable, it just leads to terrible decisions and poor mental health. Buy all time little amounts.\n\n- Never make your decisions while happy, hyped, sad, angry and not thinking rationally. Get clarity than do anything.\n\n- Convincing people, thats just stupid, look after your money not other peoples, dont tell them what to do and not get blamed later.\n\n- if you cant hodl. Either sell and move on, or forget about it. Check next time good news start popimg up.",

A lot of people are untrusted sources and everything you would pay for is out there, i didnt charge you anything for an advice even tho i accept donations haha. Also not all advices are good from all people. Its best to think on your own. If you wanna read books, psychology ones would be great, would teach you how people think and answers to many whys. Strategic ones but also financial ones could let you know something you might not know yet but not all answers lay there. Learn on other peoples mistakes and just observe. Thats what i did. I wouldnt consider myself rich, im from a very poor country. Investing what ive had made me some money, people here work for 300$/m i sold mostly at tops and managed to make something with my money which will hopefully in years do something since its compounding. I would never tell you what to do, my advices are generally applicable if you think for yourself. From the day you are born you have been told what to do so is everyone else, if you break that cycle you will be able to see out of the box and a totally new angle. Also keep in mind whenever you think you know everything you need to, there is always something you dont, for a reason or not. In life there is not an textbook you can follow to teach you in advance. Shit happens do what you can, sometimes you cant do much so try to be happy and everything else is temporarry.",

Im personally more scared bitty goes up without me than holding during a dump which is why I didn\u2019t sell it all. I have a big buy ready 24-25k as that is a logical bottom. If we dip below that, I\u2019ll scrounge up whatever I can to buy 20k and then 15k but I don\u2019t think we get there. But if we do, I\u2019ll be ready. My advice, hold what bitty you have, spend 50% of what you got to spend at 25k and then 25% at 20k and 25% at 15k but I like I said, I don\u2019t think we see 15k.",

            "selftext": "Before 1928 most countries had the gold standard. But at some point no one wanted to invest into the economy. Invest into ideas, technology, organisations, labour, etc. Everyone wanted gold, because it was the fastest growing asset. After 1928, all countries abandoned the gold standard. The speed of the economic recovery was correlated to the speed at which a country got rid of the gold standard, even along non-industrial countries.\n\nAn non-consumable asset that only has \"fiat\" value (I know you don't call bitcoin that, but its also fiat) cannot grow faster than the economy for a long period without crashing hard at some point. People divest from the economy and invest into that currency. Then everyone sits around and waits for profits and nothing gets produced in the actual economy: That's what you are literally doing in this sub here.\n\nImagine Bitcoin was the only currency that exists: There will be a part of all of bitcoin used for transactions and a part used for investment. All transaction in the economy would be worth as much as the amount of bitcoin that is not being hold as investments. Ironically while people invest, the free float /liquidity used for transactions goes down. This would make bitcoin more \"valuable\". But this would have an exponential effect: There is less and less bitcoin available for transaction, the value would explode, more and more people would want to buy bitcoin and sell everything they have for it. You don't even want to eat because that costs bitcoin that is worth double the amount tomorrow.\n\nAt some point there would be no bitcoin for transaction left. And then? A big crash? A new currency?\n\nObviously real currencies are designed to disincentivize using them as investment. They are for transactions, liquidity, maybe very short term savings. You want to force people to invest into the economy, into stocks, build something, open a business, buy an education. You need inflation for this, or at least no deflation. Stability is okay as long as its clearly under market growth rates. We found this out 1928, everyone knows this but you call them Boomer. You are on a long term experiment to show this again. It takes longer because Bitcoin isn't as relevant as gold in 1928.",

The value of businesses is based on the expected dividends which is correlated (at least at macro scale) to the sum of transactions in the economy. You can't have less transactions and a higher evaluated economy unless your whole economy is one big bubble.\n\nBuyin an ETF IS saving. You are just not saving literal money but the conflict between saving and investing still exists in the US today. For every dollar you make you can decide whether you want to invest it into something (save it) or consume (buy someting from a company).\n\nBy the way as a side note, there is an argument that ETFs also have something bubble-esque and it would be better if everyone would pick the stocks they buy themselves based on informed decisions. Stocks that are often included in the big ETFs are certainly overvalued compared to ones that aren't. But this problem is magnitudes of order smaller than the big elephant in the room that bitcoin has.",

No one lived on credit except businesses. And the society was better prepared to handle \"tough times\". \n\nBecause you are in the country with the global reserve currency you feel that etfs are savings.

I am speaking of a world where no other currency than bitcoin exists, as a simplification. Imagine you have a small economy that only trades apples. If the people in this economy trade 1,000,000 apples and all they can use as a currency is a total sum of free floating 10 BTC the price BTC/apple will have been much bigger than if you have an economy where only one apple is traded but still 10 BTC are free floating (which means that one apple did cost 10 BTC). Imagine for a simplification all transactions happen at the same time. Obviously time has an influence as well, but its utopical to think you can offset everything by speeding up the economy.",

Because that is what the sum of all transactions is, the economy. As soon as you allow people to hold it as an investment, its value will grow quicker than the economy because with everyone buying to hold there is less bitcoin left for the transactions, for running the economy.

In this way, Bitcoin can discipline fiat currencies to make sure they perform at least reasonably well in the long run. This way, the most attractive investment shifts, preventing Bitcoin from increasing in value too quickly.\n\nWhat Bitcoin does do is provide new fluidity to markets where people are not confined to one standard.

It's making a lot of controversy because of the recent drop in price , exange platforms are showing their true colors and adjusting their terms of services. \n\n400\u20ac isnt that much so no need to worry I think, especially if you're not really good with technology.

Maybe I'll do this in the future when I have the time.\n\nI don't suppose anybody can offer an explanation on why the block intervals were so crazy, other than just the randomity of the proof of work function?",

Save excess in a sound investment strategy, which Bitcoin should be a part of. Not everyone blows their whole paycheck on necessities, especially wheel barrels, thus they can set aside the rest to invest and have grow into the future, offsetting inflation.

They didn\u2019t give too much of a fuck about the bells and whistles as they did about the solid design. A ban is pretty much all the government can try to do with btc specifically or they can try to buy it all by printing more dollars to control it. Btc is past escape velocity for them to try this at this point so the best they can try is to spread POW FUD at this point. It\u2019s not going to happen without a huge uprising that they cannot afford.",

Background: Quantum computing technology will subvert the traditional cryptography, which will constitute a comprehensive national security threat (government agencies+critical infrastructure+industry). With the rise of post-quantum cryptography, the information systems of the U.S. government and industry are migrating to post-quantum cryptography. 2. Quantum Computing Network Security Readiness Act: Start the post-quantum cryptography transition within one year, conduct information technology system evaluation, determine the information system with priority transition, and issue a risk assessment strategy. Response to threat funds, international standards cooperation framework, etc. 3. Status and progress of post-quantum cryptography in the United States (2015-2022)2022 Biden included \"anti-quantum cryptography\" in the national security memorandum 4. Evaluation: This bill is aimed at the security risks of quantum computing, and aims to protect the US federal information system. American quantum technology companies all expressed their support. The localization process of anti-quantum cryptography algorithm (planning+timeline) will become an important guarantee of information security ecology. China expects to realize the commercial application of anti-quantum cryptography algorithm around 2025.\n\n\nThe development of quantum computing will not only bring opportunities, but also potential risks, especially the possibility of breaking the existing public key cryptography algorithms. The Quantum Computing Network Security Readiness Act proposed by the United States aims to protect the federal information system from the potential threats of quantum computing. American quantum technology companies including IBM, Google, QuSecure, Maybell Quantum and Quantinuum all support the Act. Since the National Quantum Initiative Act was issued in 2018, the United States has taken a series of measures to strengthen investment in personnel training and R&D, aiming at maintaining the global leadership position of the United States in quantum information science. Biden's government budgeted $187 million for NIST in fiscal year 2023, which was used to update the standards of emerging technologies, including quantum science. In May, 2022, Biden signed an executive order to strengthen the Advisory Committee of the National Quantum Initiative, which further clarified the composition and functions of the Committee.",

If that's where Bitrefill is cashing out their Bitcoin, they can afford to sell gift cards for less than face value  \n\nBut Bitrefill's volume is too high to sell on P2P markets. They probably have an account at an exchange which has 0.0% (or negative) maker fee for their monthly volume. For example, FTX has a 0% maker fee for monthly volume over $25 million",

But if you use BTC, look at the pink line, your price has remained the same or gone down so your BTC is basically worth more as time goes on whereas the dollar is worth less so you have to spend more $ to get the same thing. \n\nSo my takeaway is that BTC is a way more stable store of value than the dollar. It\u2019s actually deflationary. Which is evidenced by this chart.",

Used exclusively for transferring USD to CBP) via Zelle transfer. So I had a $250 balance in Bank 2. Then I went on my CBP and bought the $250 worth of BTC. It went through successfully. Then I thought \"oh crap, I forgot to transfer the USD into CBP\". So then I transferred from Bank 2 into CBP. Now I have $250 worth of BTC AND $250 of USD in my CBP account. I'm sure CBP knows I \"owe them\" $250 of USD because the purchase order went through prior to my USD hitting the account. But now I'm wondering how this will settle.

I heard someone once say the only people who are optimistic are people on Reddit and the rest of the world thinks it\u2019s all a joke. What will make this price go back up? In my opinion, the fact that bitcoin is used in the black market and can be used to make anonymous transactions is what keeps me optimistic. Like, there is NO WAY it can die at least not any time soon. What would make the dark web want to change currencies? That\u2019s just me though.\n\nWhat makes you so optimistic about the price to the point where you would feel almost 100% certain it will go back up even if it hit like 10k?\n\nJust looking for other views!",

                            "response": "I think you got a few things wrong.\n\nMany have likened Bitcoin to tulip mania which seems to be your view as well, that the value of Bitcoin is all hype lacking fundamentals, and someday, when the positivity runs out, the price will drop to essentially zero.\n\nFirst, I'll just argue simply that the rise of Bitcoin isn't following the pattern of a mania. That possibility could have been credibly raised years ago before we had more data, but Bitcoin has been around long enough. It's following the growth pattern of a universally useful technology, like the internet itself. If it were following the pattern of a mania it should have crashed to zero years ago.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin indeed is still fueled a lot by speculation, but the value of Bitcoin actually is derived from its utility / usefulness.\n\nIt's used as a money (store of value). People are attracted to its decentralized monetary policy that includes a fixed supply and built-in inflation reduction over the next 100+ years.\n\nPeople like that it is easy and cheap to transact, unlike (for example) gold. You can move billions of dollars worth of value to the other side of the planet with final settlement in under an hour for a couple bucks.\n\nPeople think these properties make Bitcoin useful as a reserve currency, and that makes sense. Companies and small nations have seen that potential and have subsequently put Bitcoin on their balance sheets.\n\nIt should be noted that Bitcoin is not just digital currency. When you send USD between banks digitally, perhaps via a payment processor, what you're really sending is debt. Settlement can take weeks. When you send Bitcoin, you're literally sending a commodity asset. It might feel like the same thing, and most people will probably miss the significance, but it truly is amazing. As far as we know Bitcoin is the first digital commodity.\n\nPeople also see not just the potential but the actuality of Bitcoin used as a replacement payment rail, for small daily transactions. Layered technologies expand the base layer capabilities, just like the internet was built in layers. Many companies are already building out these capabilities.\n\nThese things give me the confidence to store my money in Bitcoin. In my opinion, it's well past the point where Bitcoin could simply crash or even fade away. Unlike tulips, there is a foundation here of real utility and value, not \"hype and positivity\". This foundation holds up Bitcoin, regardless of the volatile price actions of BTC.\n\nIt is possible for people to have a surface level interest in Bitcoin where they can spin any market movement as good news, as you suggest. That's certainly an optimistic view which might work to their advantage even if they don't understand what is really giving Bitcoin its value. That doesn't mean the foundation isn't there.\n\nAll that said, Bitcoin still is a young technology with growing pains ahead. It's not perfect. There are problems to be solved. It needs to be made easier to use to prevent people from losing their money, for example. Many of us put our money in Bitcoin because we see that people are working on solving these problems. The fact that there are still problems means we're still pretty early and that Bitcoin (both BTC and the companies building the Bitcoin network) is still an interesting investment opportunity.\n\nHope that helps.",

Bitcoin is pointing at the moon, and they\u2019re looking at the finger.\n\nAs Saylor put it - \u201cthere are no informed critiques of bitcoin\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t go that far, there are perhaps a couple of potential vulnerabilities, but such is true of all investments.\n\nTaking an honest look at all the information *and* criticisms - I simply come to the conclusion that bitcoin will be one of the dominant forces of global finance within the next 10-15 years. And its seems so damn obvious, i have to remind myself it is anything but.\n\nI feel sorry for people who are baffled even now that bitcoin has come this far, it must be so frustrating to see it continually defy all insistence that is imminently about to fall to $0.\n\nIt\u2019s all out there to understand, they don\u2019t need to cling to simplistic worldviews that it\u2019s a fluke, or a tulip-style bubble. But if that\u2019s the level of depth they chose to examine the world at, then so be it.",

I don't know about you, but I have not seen any changes to government fiats which would cause me re-adopt them over bitcoin. (Unless we let the autists ruin it with BIP-119)\n\n**2) Follow farmers on social media**, and consider investing in good ones... maybe even reaching out and helping them get going with bitcoin. Just for example, I value the smaller farmers who provide meats, vegetables, fruits, and fungi as naturally and sustainably as possible. Some are expensive right now, but could do better feeding local communities healthy food at affordable prices with a little investment energy\n\nCan you imagine the power of a bitcoin-backed sustainable farming takeover? That's the kind of shit that gets people a parade in Dallas.",

This could change as I learn more about the different exchanges out there, but I like to make vids to say what I wanna say and what I think. Right now I don't see the idea of a centralized exchange as in line with a decentralized currency. I'll have a segment where I compare the TOS and Trading Rules of different exchanges and choose the \"best\" one, for my purposes & in my opinion.\n\nSo really I just want to hear from y'all what some of your experiences with a centralized exchange were like. Good? Bad? Neutral? Went as expected?

Just as with fusion that has \"almost been posible, almost there, so close to making it a reality\" since the 1930s,so too will be quantum computing for quite a while. \n\nAnything that is claimed to be a quantum computer is not \"fully quantum\" and if anything, just partially quantum.\n\nThen the next issue is, say someone builds a quantum computer, how is it tested? How do we differentiate it from a non quantum super computer? Do we just trust that it is?\n\nThere's a lot of discussion around those issues.  I'm happy to read any links you can provide to the contrary. Check out Slashdot as they have covered and discussed this matter quite a bit! Tyvm",

That's what Google is doing and it is useful for AI applications but not for discrete problems like breaking asymmetric encryption. \n\nFor discrete problems it's fairly easy to test by solving a problem that would take 10th of thousands of years with even the most powerful super computers in a reasonable amount of time. If the solution is correct (which is easy to test eg. trying if the calculated private key belongs to the public key) then we can claim to have achieved what is called [quantum supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy).\n\nOnce we achieve it at the needed scale it is not over for Bitcoin. Especially not for mining. It would make mining more efficient but not by a huge factor it reduces the number of trials from N to sqrt(N). The difficulty adjustment would automatically increase the difficulty accordingly. Most problematic would be addresses with balance whose public keys are known. That is only the case for addresses where a transaction has been published. Eg. reused addresses or addresses that someone wants to spend from but the transaction is only in the mempool but not in the blockchain yet. \n\nThe Bitcoin protocol can be adjusted to use post quantum cryptography once the threat becomes real. Then people need to move their funds to these new addresses that use post quantum crypto and finally only addresses that have been spent from but the owner lost the keys or doesn't care to upgrade would be at risk.

Quantum annealing is used mainly for problems where the search space is discrete (combinatorial optimization problems) with many local minima; such as finding the ground state of a spin glass or the traveling salesman problem. The term \"quantum annealing\" was first proposed in 1988 by B. Apolloni, N. Cesa Bianchi and D. De Falco as a quantum-inspired classical algorithm.\n \n**[Quantum supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy)** \n \n >In quantum computing, quantum supremacy or quantum advantage is the goal of demonstrating that a programmable quantum device can solve a problem that no classical computer can solve in any feasible amount of time (irrespective of the usefulness of the problem). Conceptually, quantum supremacy involves both the engineering task of building a powerful quantum computer and the computational-complexity-theoretic task of finding a problem that can be solved by that quantum computer and has a superpolynomial speedup over the best known or possible classical algorithm for that task.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

Sending money to anyone in the world without need of approval of anyone.\n\nBut for the transaction to make sense, Bitcoin must have some value. It's a lucrative investment due to its ability to maintain value / appreciate over time. It's value is driven up by halving cycles that happen every 4 years, whereby the supply of bitcoin reduces by half, ie the rewards for the same work (mining) halves, ie its value goes up. Presently, it's supply is also driven up by adoption. \n\nIt is secure, decentralized, trustless, and some may say \"perfect money\". If your intent is to collect Bitcoin as an investment, ride out the 4 year cycle. \n\nEducate yourself, there's plenty of worthwhile resources out there. If Bitcoin matches your values and you believe in its importance, worth and utility, take this time of fear and instability as an opportunity to increase your allocation and reduce your buying price.\n\nIt's youth and small market cap means volatility is to be expected. With so many players not yet educated about the true purpose of bitcoin, the market can be quite erratic.",

Bitcoin can not be totally called a currency on the regulatory standpoint even though it does meet the requirements to be called so (on a user standpoint; you can easily send it to someone like a merchant or a family member abroad, it is accepted by many users and a few governments). However barter has always persisted on  \"markets\" as people basically exchange goods for goods; you can exchange bitcoin for a car as long as both are happy. That makes it close to a currency if you\u2019re capable to exchange bitcoin for a car, salt, sugar, wheat... or anything, you name it. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that btc or another crypto-related \"asset\" will be deemed as a currency in developed countries as they are biased; Why dropping a system which the government controls, produces and monitor for something else? Moreover it is funny that cash or government managed \"currency\" could totally be described as a shitcoin; Cash is untraceable, can finance illicit activities, has an undefined supply... \ud83e\udd21  Finally, keep in mind that your USD on paper and in your bank account will always be 1 USD (as it is the usual asset used for comparison) but inflation eats it up. Many always perceive one side of the coin; prices INCREASE because of an eventual scarcity of supply shock of the raw material/asset but few think that the price difference is DUE TO DEVALUATION OF THE USD BY INFLATION.\n\nTo sum-up:\n\n\\-BTC is more of an asset usable for barter. Can be defined as currency or a mean to transact but won't by many government because of conflict of interest (and it's volatility, even though it can be straight exchanged for stables).\n\n\\-USD (and fiat usually) is a vicious shitcoin that is centralised, no supply limit, printed on-demand that benefit only few people. It also devalues a lot over time.",

There are, what we call, prepper currencies: ammo, alcohol, seeds, med supplies, preserved food, water filtration tools, weather-appropriate clothes, etc. Notice I didn't mention dollars, rubles, bitcoins, or pesos.\n\nPrecious metals and jewels have also worked well in the past, not sure how they would work now when most people can't tell the difference between an amethyst and glass.\n\nMediums of exchange are great in times of relative peace, or when there are more peaceful places that you can escape to (i.e. buying dollars in Venezuela and immigrating to Columbia to then sell the dollars for local currency). In fact, Bitcoin makes that infinitely safer because it's a lot easier to confiscate a bag full of cash or shut down international transfers (as has been done to Russians & Canadian truckers), than it is to find and steal 12 words while you're crossing a border.",

Fiat money needs energy and factories and resources  to produce the little pieces of paper too.  Needs energy to maintain electronic USD as well.  The difference is that to transact in BTC  it cannot be blocked by any government or bank.  But your USD accounts can be frozen should the government or a bank decide that.\nObviously the BTC network uses power in form of farmers processing transactions.  But so do banks.  And energy isn\u2019t monopolized by any one government or bank.  You can choose any country in the world to set up Bitcoin farms.  And since BTC can be transacted across borders without any government ability to block it, it becomes a non issue, compared to fiat money that actually NEEDS banks cooperation and their networks in order to transact.\n\nBTC doesn\u2019t need any central authority or bank.  I can send you BTC directly from my wallet to yours and nobody is able to stop that.  That\u2019s the point.\n\nSure governments can block you from buying Fiat money with Bitcoin.  This is true!  But if you pay for everything with Bitcoin it becomes a non issue.  The only reason governments have any shred of control is that they have power over the exchanges where money gets converted to Fiat.  But if you don\u2019t need Fiat money and transact in Bitcoin only then it\u2019s out of governments hands.  And this is why China blocked use of Bitcoin because they are scared of it.  They don\u2019t want to lose that control.  Don\u2019t get me wrong Chinese people still hold Bitcoin even though it\u2019s banned.  But they can\u2019t convert it to their local currency because China blocked exchanges in China from selling fiat money for Bitcoin.\n\n[Can Governments Stop Bitcoin?](https://quillette.com/2021/02/21/can-governments-stop-bitcoin/)",

            "selftext": "What Bitcoin Could Be Worth to Fidelity. You\u2019ll Be Surprised.\nBy Joe Light\nMay 7, 2022 5:00 am ET\n\n\n\u201cFidelity's push into Bitcoin is raising controversy but could be lucrative for the company.\nDreamstime.com\nFidelity Investments shocked the retirement industry last month with a move to make Bitcoin available in 401(k) plans. Add up the revenue that might bring in, and it starts to be less of a surprise.\n\nFidelity is the country\u2019s largest administrator of 401(k)s, overseeing 23,000 plans. Workers plow part of their paycheck in the plans every pay period, often getting a match from their employers. Contribution limits are $20,500 in 2022 with an additional $6,500 for workers over age 50.\n\nFidelity administered $2.7 trillion in 401(k) assets at the end of 2021. The Boston-based firm said it will let employers add a Bitcoin account to 401(k)s later this year, putting Bitcoin on the menu next to mutual funds holding stocks and bonds.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for Fidelity? A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows it could bring in hundreds of millions in additional revenue, albeit likely many years down the line.\n\n\nFidelity says it will charge fees between 0.75% and 0.9% for the digital assets account, in addition to undisclosed transaction fees. The company says it will limit Bitcoin to 20% of a 401(k) balance.\n\nAssuming a 1% to 5% allocation for investors, Fidelity could earn between $203 million and $1.2 billion in administrative fees from its Bitcoin accounts, not including transaction fees. Assuming 10% of its $2.7 trillion in assets eventually goes into Bitcoin, Fidelity could rake in more than $2 billion in annual administrative fees.\n\nGranted, 10% in Bitcoin may be unattainable, at least near-term. Some crypto proponents say a suitable Bitcoin allocation for an average retirement saver is between 1% and 5%. (Detractors, of course, say an allocation of zero is more reasonable.)\n\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether even 1% of Fidelity\u2019s 401(k) assets will get into crypto any time soon. While employers will have the option to add a digital-assets account, it\u2019s far from certain that many will choose that option, partly due to legal liabilities.\n\n\u201cThe primary motive for sponsors is to not get sued,\u201d said Ron Surz, a pension consulting veteran and head of Target Date Solutions. Bitcoin\u2019s adoption in plans will likely depend on its performance over the next several years and fees for owning the crypto, said Surz, who thinks it could take 10 to 20 years for the asset class to become a significant part of 401(k) assets.\n\nOne hitch could be the Labor Department, which may be about to crack down on 401(k)s that allow investors to hold crypto. The department in March said employers who offer crypto should expect to be questioned about how such a move squares with their fiduciary duties. After Fidelity\u2019s move, a top DOL official doubled down, expressing serious concerns about crypto\u2019s suitability as a retirement asset.\n\nCongress isn\u2019t likely to provide any clarity either. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R.-Ala.) on Thursday said he is introducing a bill to prevent the DOL from prohibiting Bitcoin or other assets in 401(k) plans. But such legislation faces long odds in the Democratic-controlled Senate, where lawmakers like Elizabeth Warren (D.-Mass.) have already questioned Fidelity\u2019s plan.\n\n\nEmployers may also wary of being sued by investors for offering a volatile investment like Bitcoin, which could expose them to lawsuits for breach of fiduciary duty. A recent poll of plan sponsors found that only 2% said they would consider adding crypto to a 401(k) menu.\n\nStill, Fidelity is playing the long game. Company officials have said they see the Bitcoin product as just the start, aiming to expand to other digital assets.\n\nFidelity is also building out institutional trading and custody services for crypto. The company could thus capitalize on both the retail side, through 401(k) plans, and its institutional side.\n\nHow much Bitcoin will bring into Fidelity isn\u2019t known, of course. The firm could lose assets that shift out of its mutual funds into digital accounts, and the product\u2019s fees could come down as its assets grow and it faces new competition.\n\nChange also comes at a glacial pace in 401(k)s. The DOL in 2006 issued new rules that made it much easier for companies to auto-enroll employees, for instance. More than a decade later, only 62% of plans use that feature, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America.\n\n\nStill, if Fidelity were to gain even $500 million a year from Bitcoin\u2013a mid-range figure\u2013it would be nothing to sniff at. Last year, Fidelity had total revenue of about $24 billion.\n\nThe company declined to comment on its potential Bitcoin revenues.\n\nIf digital assets one day grab a good chunk of retirement portfolios, pressuring Fidelity\u2019s fees in other products, a little Bitcoin could go a long way.\u201d",

Or do you prefer it goes up to $100k so that your DCA purchasing power gets sliced by over 50%?\n\nLet's suppose that for the past 6-month, bitcoin has been on average about $40k per month, and that you've been DCA-ing monthly.\n\nNow if BTC ever does go to $1million per coin and stays above it... the amount of bitcoin you're DCA has accumulated throughout these 6 months will take you a decade to accumulate once BTC gets to $1million per coin.\n\nSo instead of hoping for an action-packed rollercoaster, maybe we should just be thankful we can DCA at such cheap prices!",

An offline machine where you imported the seed and an online machine where you setup Electrum as \"watch-only\" with your public master key. Of course only in case of emergency.\n\nYou would then prepare the desired emergency transaction on the hot wallet side, export the unsigned transaction to the cold wallet side and sign it there. Then you would reimport the signed transaction into the hot wallet Electrum and broadcast the transaction from there. That's a quite secure way to do it. But guess I'd only recommend it to advanced users who know what they are doing.",

                                    "response": "There is 2 ways of moving sats into your lightning wallet:\n\n1- the easy way is to create an invoice on your lightning wallet and have another lightning wallet scan and pay it and sats would be in your wallet.\n\n2- The longer way which is what you are asking (I think) is: to install a node, let say c-lightning node (or an 'lnd' node) and once it is up you need to fund it and here is where your current bitcoin sigwit wallet comes in: create a new address\n\nlightning-cli newaddr\n\nThe previous command will return a segwit native bc1 address. Here is what meant when I said it is native (default). If you need a p2sh segwit address that starts in a 3 and is compatible will non-segwit wallets or exchanges, run this command instead.\n\nlightning-cli newaddr p2sh-segwit\n\nAt this point you send some sats from your sigwit wallt to the above address, a normal onchain  send tx. So now you actually have a full fledged lightning wallet on your own node with some sats in it. Now you need to connect to a reputable node which provides your node with incoming capacity. So at this point you have a full lightning wallet with send and receive capabilities ( the connection and channels and funding channels are a bit more work but we won't go there for simplicity).\n\nYou can now create an invoice (like step 1) and do a:\n\nlightning-cli pay lnbc1500n1pwfja4pp5xmw9m37spxhlppmd4y\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nthe lnbc1500n.... being the invoice.\n\nSo your sats moved from you lightning wallet on your node to the lightning wallet (the one you had before, like one on you phone for example.) This wallet could have a gui ux so wont use the commands like we did above. The people who created the c-lightning also have RTL (ride the lightning) which is a nice tool that acts like a gui for you node wallet. If we had used 'lnd' the steps would have been very much in parallel.\n\nSo now you actually have 2 lightning wallets, one that you already had and one that you created using the node.. the MAIN advantage of the second wallet is that it is in your 'custody', you own your sats and you won't loose them once the company behind the phone wallet disappears.\n\nregards\n\n'so you won't lose them!'... lol",

I told him ok but i have to get this money it gets turned into right away. then told me just throw it all in because I will. then forgot about fees. so had to pay off fees that took lots of time then he said congrats, you can now transfer these funds into my bitcoin account. so I did then get email from fxally saying i have to pay withdrawal fee of almost 4k. and he forgot about that he said. is there a way i can sue? there must be because he screwed me over lots",

                    "response": "The majority of the money created isn\u2019t really printed. It\u2019s given to institutions, companies and private households as a loan. If you buy a car for 30k$ and finance it with a bank, the bank just creates that money out of nothing and gives it to you. Once you paid it back in full, the money disappears again. This would normally be fine but you taking out a loan for a car that you can\u2019t really afford just makes the cars more expensive in the future because you suddenly have a higher demand. This forces other people to take even higher loans (31k$) for the same car in the future. And the total debt of the system increases gradually over time. This means more money in circulation (even though it\u2019s supposed to vanish later). \nIf you stop this system and for example forbid new loans, the whole system will crash and people will loose their jobs etc. \nThat\u2019s why central banks still pump money into the economy\u2026 (pretty basic explanation though)",

In order to peg the dollar to Bitcoin, that is, in order for the \"peg\" to mean anything, it's my understanding that the government would need to maintain enough Bitcoin in reserve to allow everyone who holds USD to exchange it, on demand, for Bitcoin. (I suppose they could put rules in place to limit the frequency and amount of redemptions, but unless they maintained a 100% reserve, I don't see how it would be a real peg.) \n\nIn order to fill the reserve, the government would need to buy ~$22 trillion worth of Bitcoin. There are, I'm guessing, maybe 1-2 million Bitcoin available for purchase on exchanges. The government might be able to get a few hundred thousand Bitcoin in the $40,000 to $80,000 range, but that'll only cover about 0.1% to 0.2% of the reserve requirement. As they continue to buy to fill the reserve, the exchange rate will go higher and higher as every last coin that someone is willing to part with gets immediately purchased to fill the reserve. Assuming the market supply remains near zero, the final exchange rate will skyrocket to around $11,000,000:1. Only then, with a full reserve of Bitcoin to back the USD, could the USD be pegged -- at $11,000,000 to 1 BTC -- to Bitcoin.\n\nAgain, I'm not an economist so my assumptions and understanding of pegged currencies could be flawed, but without a fully stocked reserve I don't understand how a \"peg\" would work.",

In order to peg their currency to a thing, wouldn't that government need to buy $22 trillion of the thing?

Pegging a currency is not an all or nothing sort of status, the rules are ultimately set by that Government, the value of its currency can strengthen if the Government is able to make good on its promises to exchange either at a set price or at a flexible market price, preferably below global market price. This is what results in more demand for the currency, so that people can exchange for gold/bitcoin at a discount from their Government. A Government that would do this with Bitcoin, would probably already have built a \"war chest\" before beginning the program, just like they would have with gold.\n\nI don't believe many Governments in the past would keep anywhere near the equivalent amount of Gold in price equivalence to the full money supply issued, rather they attempt to keep the supply high enough to continue fulfilling the promise, as not everyone is interested in doing this exchange so there is only so much demand on the Government reserve. The supply can be held up over time from buying the commodity from other countries, could be from pillaging it in wars, could be from mining it (in both cases), could be by confiscating it from criminals, foreigners, or anyone they can. If they start confiscating it from their own law abiding citizens, (such as asking/demanding it back at a set price exchange, in order to fund a big war effort or something to show you support your country) you know the supply is getting very low. Once they run too low, best course of action to is end the standard and begin the cycle of accumulating for next time and let the currency weaken.",

But update the firmware anyway, can't hurt.\n\nThe main limitation of the Nano S is that it has very limited memory to store crypto-specific apps. That means that if you have multiple different cryptocurrencies, it can be tricky to manage them at the same time. You can uninstall and reinstall the app for a cryptocurrency without it affecting your funds, so you can manage many different coins by juggling which apps you have installed. But this can get tedious.\n\nBut if you just HODL some BTC, then the Nano S will do everything you need.\n\nMake sure to never enter the 24 word seed phrase on a computer, phone or other connected device and store that seed phrase in a safe location.",

BTC doesn't have that problem.\n\nlong story short there are some valid reasons to hold BTCB (DeFi) but if you don't know what BSC or BEP20 or metamask is and you're not interested in learning about DeFi, you shouldn't be messing around with BTCB.",
