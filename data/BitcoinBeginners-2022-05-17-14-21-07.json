I tried searching for this answer but was not getting a clear response\u2026\n\nI\u2019m in the US, want to set a limit buy order and pay the lowest fees possible. I also need to be able to move the Bitcoin off line after it clears. What\u2019s my best option? Coin base pro? Currently I\u2019m using Strike and FTX to buy but I\u2019m feeling like a slave constantly checking prices waiting to buy at my price target.\n\nThanks and HOLD!",
