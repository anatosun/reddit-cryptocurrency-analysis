When more and more fiat money is printed, yes it may cause inflation and reduce the purchasing power of the dollar but doesn\u2019t it also help people take out loans and stay afloat?\n\nAdditionally, global bitcoin adoption would cause banks\u2019 business models to change - would bitcoin loans function the same way fiat does?\n\nI\u2019m no economist whatsoever and i welcome any insight but to me it seems that in a world of bitcoin, big businesses will eventually dominate its supply, and people may find it difficult to take out loans",

Bitcoin cannot fix all societal problems but It can make it a bit more fair for the average person by :\n\n1) Reduces the negative cantillon effect of fiat by removing some of the control over currency from a small group of people that is in part due to fiat being inflationary\nhttps://fee.org/articles/the-cantillon-effect-because-of-inflation-we-re-financing-the-financiers/\n\n2) keeps fiat currency in check where too much inflation will cause more capital flight to Bitcoin and prevents corrupt governments from abusing the backdoor tax of inflation\n\n3)  encourages more savings instead of debt slavery which removes choice, confidence and power away from individuals",

You\u2019d pay to deposit you bitcoin for safekeeping. You\u2019d only get interest if you agreed to a certain lock up period in which case the institution could lend out your bitcoin for that time period. It seems foreign to us now but we contemplated going to a 100% reserve system many times in the past. It would remove the whole boom and bust business cycle that the Fed creates and that we are going through right now.\n\nThe stable supply of bitcoin would also prevent people from being robbed by inflation. Wars and excessive government spending would have to be paid for with taxes. It would create a much more fair world. Income inequality should also be reduced.",

                            "response": "Bitcoin is superior to fiat in 6 of 8 ways today and might become better in the last 2 with more time \n\nLets discuss some of the properties of what makes a good currency and where Bitcoin fits now \n\n\n**1) Durability** = Gold is best here due to its history and physical nature. Bitcoin and fiat  being digital in nature means we must compare the  durability of the institution/network that issues and secures them. I would suggest that Bitcoin will slightly excel responsible nation states here and does far better than  unreliable forms of fiat when looking at the history of fiat compared the the history and properties of Bitcoin(2017 gave a lot of credibility to Bitcoin in it thwarting a powerful attack and nation states have repeatedly attacked Bitcoin to one degree or another)\n\n**2) Portability** = Gold is horrible in this category being physical, heavy and unable to be sent digitally(custodians don't count as you lose most the benefits of gold and it switched categories from a bearer asset to registered value). Bitcoin beats fiat here too as its peer to peer , global and lacks regulatory friction. \n\n**3) Fungibility** Gold and Bitcoin tie here. When comparing fiat to Bitcoin it is more complicated but Bitcoin beats fiat here overall and is significantly getting better each year (see link above) . Physical fiat has some advantages over Bitcoin in the sense that its easier to have strong privacy locally as long as the whole \"anonymity set\" (group of users) avoid depositing the fiat in ATMs and banks(physical cash has serial numbers that are tracked with OCR + bill readers everywhere). Bitcoin can be very private if you use the right wallet and you take precautions but if you make a mistake you can also have problems. Digital fiat isn't very fungible or private at all. Gold isn't as fungible as many people suggest either due to different grading, certifying prices, forms which all fetch different prices.\n\n**4) Scarcity** -- Bitcoin wins this hands down with a fixed and limited supply. ~2-4 million BTc have been permanently lost/destroyed and many people also a long term investors leading to more scarcity. Gold is a distant 2nd with concerns in asteroid mining - (Psyche 16 as an example) and not knowing if any other large deposit can be found but far superior to fiat. \n\n**5) Divisibility** Bitcoin is already divisible by 8 decimal places onchain and 1/1000 of a satoshi on other layers like lightning. Thus micro txs are possible with bitcoin and too impractical with gold and not as easily done with fiat due to regulatory friction  and costs. The idea is that machines and software can tip other software, machines, and services by the minute or second to allow for more granularity and thus more efficiency with lower prices.\n\n**6) Acceptability** - Fiat wins this category for the time being due to its acceptance worldwide , especially US dollars. Bitcoin being a global currency without regulatory friction can one day overtake even the most accepted fiat however. Almost no one accepts gold for payment so its last and this is unlikely to change. \n\n**7) Verifiability** - Bitcoin wins here slightly over gold and fiat. Gold can be verified but takes more effort and there are concerns with tungsten filled bars and fake gold. Bitcoin being swept from a private key(coin or paper) or accepting an open dime is better than fiat physical cash, and digital fiat has very large concerns and delays in verification (chargebacks, fraud, etc...)\n\n**8) stability as a unit of account** - While Bitcoin is better than certain forms of fiat in this category, most are more stable than bitcoin and so Bitcoin remains 3rd compared to fiat and gold. We hope that Bitcoin in time will become less volatile with a much larger market cap . This trend is already occurring ,and much economic theory supports this happening but its still an experiment as to how long it will take and what size market cap / liquidity is needed\n\nSo you can see bitcoin is already better than fiat in 6 of the 8 categories above and the 2 remaining categories just take time.",
