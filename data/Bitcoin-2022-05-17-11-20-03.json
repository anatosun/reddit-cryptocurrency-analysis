Regulations like we saw in china only strengthened the bitcoin network as it shutdown some larger ASIC farms and spread those ASICs all over china and elsewhere in a much more distributed matter . A typical ASIC will use ~3-4k watts which is well within the variance of normal household usage so as long as a home is using 3 or less ASICs they won't be easily found by regulators looking at the power grid.",

Before we went off the gold exchange standard, the personal savings rate was trending upward to the 9-10% range. Under the fiat standard, the personal savings rate trended downward (besides the 2008 recession and pandemic). If we put the savings rate under the fiat standard at 4-5% (which is being conservative given the trajectory), then it's fair to say that the Bitcoin standard would reduce consumption by at least 5%. \n\nFurther, the personal saving rate does not take into consideration debt accumulated. Currently, median household debt is $59,800. Household debt as a percentage of GDP hovers around 80% vs. 40% in the 1970s. The reversal of this debt accumulation would reduce consumption by an even larger amount than 5%.\n\nCurrent PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) sits at almost $17T, 5% of that value would be $0.85T. Not to mention, this is not a one-off event, but a persistent drop in consumption as we transition. I would think this would be every environmentalists' wet dream.",

And this trait makes it so that people are not pressured to spend their bitcoin now, because it will not be devalued by introducing more supply in the future. Whereas the US dollar is devalued yearly through inflation\u2026this makes people spend money now because it\u2019s *guaranteed* to be worth less in the future.
