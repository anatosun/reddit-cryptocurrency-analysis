I tried to orange pill him, talked about the 21M limit, decentralization, network effects, etc. I think some of the analogies I used (digital gold) helped but ultimately it was hard for him to get it. \u201cWhat happens when all the bitcoin are mined? Will there be none left?\u201d \u201cIs there a Bitcoin bank? Do I open an account?\u201d Things like that.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to lose sight of the average person\u2019s level of knowledge when you\u2019re deep in the community. We are so early. What are the best ways you have found to orange pill the people you know?",

They see their getting into bitcoin would benefit me (because I was \u201cearly\u201d) and I have an incentive to promote it. So these days if after some reasonable attempts the person is still unresponsive, I just leave them alone and let them find out, hopefully they will eventually get it.
