            "selftext": "Goood morning,\n\nI was hoping someone could refer me to resources on bitcoins network integrity as it pertains to its supply and code. As demand rises there is a larger incentive for individuals to \"create more bitcoin\". I recently had a debate with a boomer and my arguement about game theory and incentives for the rest of the network to weed out the individual was not sticking. I need more research in this area.\n\n1). If a percentage of the network alters the code, does this create a fork and how? Has this ever happened? \n\n2) why would it never reach consesus to increase the supply. If 60% of the network was bribed what would happen?\n\n3.) I tried to argue that all assets have this problem but unlike all other assets the people who get to make that decision is far larger then any other asset class. What is a better way to explain that?",

                    "response": "1. Bitcoin has no code, its a protocol. You can write your own node code if you wanted. As long as you operate within the protocol its fine. But if violate the protocol, like giving yourself coins or making unauthorized transfers, other nodes will just ignore you. If a percentage of the network does this, yes its a fork, its just a different protocol.\n2. That would a be a hard fork. Users can decide which fork they want to use. Since bitcoin's scarcity is a pretty core reason why most people use bitcoin, its unlikely a fork that alters the supply would become more popular than the original.\n3. Probably to just explain it like gold, its a digital asset but has scarcity. Why it has scarcity is a technical explanation that they should probably need to do their own research on.",

Bitcoin itself is relatively simple once you get by initial misconceptions. You can go down the rabit hole on different consensus mechanisms, game theory, cryptography, etc. especially relating to other cryptocurrencies. So maybe just focus on bitcoin and proof of work first, public-key cryptography as well if you aren't familiar.",
