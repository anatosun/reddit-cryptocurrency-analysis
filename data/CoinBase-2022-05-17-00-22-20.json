It precisely says you don't have this coin - even thought I never chose which coin I want to do it with. Is there any other way I can get tether with coinbase? I was able to send XLM back to coinbase, sent it back to the wallet - transfer confirmed. And yet, I'm still unable to see any coins in the \"trade\" tab. Is that normal? If so, how can I buy tether on coinbase? Or should I use another exchange for this?",

Bernie Madoff was ordered to sit in prison until he died for ponzie schemes that were lesser in value and lesser in customer losses.\n\nSo yeah, kind of a thing, but you have immunity because the Government hates cryptocurrency and so your mistake in offering a doomed altcoin and customers losing 100% of their investment, is music to their ears.",
