Bernie Madoff was ordered to sit in prison until he died for ponzie schemes that were lesser in value and lesser in customer losses.\n\nSo yeah, kind of a thing, but you have immunity because the Government hates cryptocurrency and so your mistake in offering a doomed altcoin and customers losing 100% of their investment, is music to their ears.",

It precisely says you don't have this coin - even thought I never chose which coin I want to do it with. Is there any other way I can get tether with coinbase? I was able to send XLM back to coinbase, sent it back to the wallet - transfer confirmed. And yet, I'm still unable to see any coins in the \"trade\" tab. Is that normal? If so, how can I buy tether on coinbase? Or should I use another exchange for this?",
