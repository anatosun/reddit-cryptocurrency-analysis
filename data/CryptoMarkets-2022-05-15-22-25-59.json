As Africa develops and it inevitably will, in the future these people will seek to connect themselves to the rest of civilization and countries and companies will have to develop infrastructure to accommodate their demands. Now the most sustainable way to start and operate a telecommunications company is certainly through the usage of blockchain technology as it provides the most means to accomplish the goals necessary for  sustainable operations.  \n\n\nIn my opinion companies like World Mobile Token, Telcoin etc that have started to implement blockchain from the very beginning will certainly have an advantage and will also be more future proof as more and more tech companies look to blockchain to maintain their operations and increase profits.  \n\n\nNow I realize that this might seem as a very terrifying place to invest but I believe that if timed right investments in this emerging sector can bring benefits to anyone that dares to leap.",

For example if traders need more margin to trade AXS, the APY of that coin is 278.5% (current example). Is it just me, or is it really all genius in simplicity? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWHAT am I LOSING in this process?",

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because they weren\u2019t around for Lehman and 2007 or they are just that mentally deficient. \n\nBut we just watch LUNA and UST which had a combined market cap of $58B a week ago go to basically zero. LUNA had a $40B market cap 2 days ago. It\u2019s worth a few hundred million at the time of this. \n\nTo put that into perspective Lehman brothers had a $46B market cap before their collapse in August of 2007. Lehmans collapse sent a ripple effect on the rest of the financial markets and almost collapsed the global economy until the central banks stepped in and bailed them out. That was one bank going under in a global market that was much larger and had been around for hundred plus years.\n\nIf you don\u2019t think once people start to digest that two top 10 coins valued at $58B is going to have catastrophic effects on a much smaller market that a lot of people already don\u2019t trust, isn\u2019t regulated so can\u2019t be bailed out and and has existed for less than a decade, then you deserve everything that is coming to you. \n\nWe just watched a larger Lehman collapse in 24 hours time and everyone\u2019s just back to the \u201cbuy the dip, Diamond hands\u201d \n\nFrankly, you did this to yourselves",

Dow Jones is old and crypto is new so it couldn't possibly experience recession and growth over the years to come. There's no point trying if your licked from the beginning\". \n\nThis is how you come across to me. Your broad generalisations and very narrow minded approach paints a picture of a cynical and pessimistic person who only wants to way the cons and jump and shout only after the fire has started. What do you gain from criticising people, when you have no skin in the game yourself. You obviously don't want to help people since you belittle them and hope they get the comeuppance.\n\nOf course there is risk involved. Of course people don't want crypto succeed. Of course some people are only interested in making money. This doesn't mean the institution as whole is a flop. Always research and participate in things like DeFi, Dapps, and other crypto based projects to get a full scope. The list is long and still growing everyday. \n\nIf you think crypto is just people trading imaginary bits in CEX of course you would garner this opinion. But if you look beyond the the graphs and the cost there's real word application that solve bigger issues than my retirement. \n\nInnovators and adopters by nature don't settle for one concept, or stop after on success/failure, it's the continued drive to expand wether there 1 or a 1000 people supporting you. Wether there's $1 or $100,000 dollars of value, it's the core tenants and beliefs that drive people. \n\nDare to dream for a better world for others and yourself, there's never any shame in it.",

It's offshoot, the CFPB, has itself been the tipping point for closures of small and mid-sized banks across the country ever since. The over regulation is truly a sight to behold - for anyone in the banking industry who's been there awhile you know what I mean. Post DF your company needs about 5 more lawyers and 25 analysts to cover your ass and satisfy the regulator who's in house 6 months out of the year. It sucks. It's expensive. And that doesn't even touch the arbitrary fines which will also potentially be levied against you for rule by enforcement. \n\nI say all this because this is what the US government does. They take a singular scary thing and use it as an excuse to create massive control and fee generating infrastructure. Let's hope it doesn't happen like that to crypto exchanges.",

When doing this you can invest a relatively small amount of money and make a lot more as the company grows and the value of its products increases this especially goes for crypto and NFT companies.\n\nNow I've been paying attention lately to  crypto telecommunications companies because I believe there is no other future for telekom that blockchain based technologies as the ever evolving complexity of that sector and growing costs mean that they will eventually have to switch to a blockchain in order to maintain profitability. I strongly believe that companies like Giant, World Mobile Token have a great future because they are the future and with some luck and a good business model any investment in companies like these might be a very prudent business decision.\n\nNow I'm almost certain that my approach to this is a good approach but I would still like to hear your opinions on this, give me your opinions.",

            "selftext": "TLDR: YieldNodes is a passive income for people with a lower risk tolerance. YieldNodes has generated around 8% monthly on average for the last two and a bit years. It is a slower rate of return for most De-Fi degens but slow and steady is an alternative approach. If autocompounded you're looking at 200%+ from a stable environment 2 yrs proven.\n\nI've been on the hunt for a passive income option that provides an almost stable return and something almost similar to an index fund.\n\nI came across YieldNodes in a YouTube video and didn't really pay too much attention until I got burned and burned time and time again chasing a beggars belief with the de-fi world. I decided to look into YieldNodes again and this is where I found out more.\n\nYieldNodes has been around for about two years now and still looking relatively solid despite a few upturns during the last few years (glancing back to May 2021 and March 2020). \n\nOf course it goes without saying that previous performance does not indicate future returns but they've averaged approximately 8% in the last few years. \n\nI've scoured the internet for alternative views to YieldNodes but honestly its been mostly overwhelmingly positive. \n\nThe team appear to be very transparent, they do most of the leg work themselves and their communication is very good and they've always got back to me quickly. \n\nEssentially you deposit a sum, they then use this to rent master node servers and you earn money from the transactions that are validated on the blockchain and this is paid back to you by BTC. Nothing is traded so you won't be susceptible to fluctuations in price.\n\nYieldNodes policy is that they will return your deposit AND your profits after three months if the performance is less than 5% consecutively. Alternatively you can have your deposit returned in full after six months or an emergency withdrawal option at minus 25% (deposit $1000, get $750 back). \n\nAutocompounding feature means that you can feather how much percentage wise you wish to autocompound back into the fund. Also it has a handy calculator to show you the previous returns over the last two years if you'd invested x amount which is factual because its based from the actual returns not predicted.\n\nQuestions I had were:\n\nIf I deposit BTC at $30k and it drops to $15k (wishful thinking) will I lose money? No you won't you'll get back the amount you deposited to the value of BTC.\n\nAccording to their business model, YieldNodes has 2x the value of deposits in holdings to pay people back if anything was to go wrong. As you are renting a masternode, the value deposited isn't tied to a coin so you won't be losing out if it goes to zero. Of course nothing is guaranteed so there is still an element of risk attached to this. \n\nI'd honestly say do more research on this if it is something you might be interested in. I'll happily answer questions to the best of my knowledge but of a $10,000 deposit I'm returning $750 avg per month and compounding it to generate more!\n\nHave to be honest here and say the links below are an affiliate (no cost to you), totally your choice if you wish to use my sign up link but if you found it helpful I'd really appreciate it. It just means that I get a 5% payout from YieldNodes based on the deposit you put in so if you do use my affiliate link **MESSAGE ME** because I'll give you 50% of what I make from it back as it'll show on my affiliate page.\n\nThanks for reading and hope its been helpful.\n\n[https://members.yieldnodes.com/c/?a=wLd2Q2KA6eoPVYx&redirect=signup](https://members.yieldnodes.com/c/?a=wLd2Q2KA6eoPVYx&redirect=signup)\n\nLink for more info - [https://yieldnodes.com?a=wLd2Q2KA6eoPVYx](https://yieldnodes.com?a=wLd2Q2KA6eoPVYx)",

I think decoupling alts from BTC right now would be perfect for the entire market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen you see projects like HBAR foundation literally allocating more than $500 million to expand Hedera\u2019s network and introduce new projects to the ecosystem, you\u2019d expect prices to be pumping hard. But the reality is that we\u2019re seeing the exact opposite.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is AWFUL cause this means that projects will slowly but sure lose motivation when it comes to improvement and development cause there hasn\u2019t been any return on that for the longest now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI blame this phenomenon on bots. As soon as they detect Bitcoin is dipping they instantly start shorting and dumping alts cause they know these are the ones that usually get affected the most. So basically, its a cycle that\u2019s feeding itself at this point.",

Is it possible to involve 4 companies for a scam????\n\nThe seller asked the buyer and brokers to create a wallet on Vaulta Wallet, and directly transferred the 5,000 BTC, as well as my 50 BTC commission, to my newly created wallet.\n\nNow I can\u2019t withdraw my BTC. Before I have to pay 4.5 Ethereum and deposit that ETH in Vaulta Wallet so that they allow me to move my BTC to an external wallet, outside of Vaulta.\n\nMy concern is that if I transfer that 4.5 Eth to my Vaulta wallet, then they might disappear with my Eth and BTC.\n\nPlease someone help me to know if he has done any successful or fraudulent operation within Vaulta Wallet.\n\nThank you very much.",

Profound scientific startups are generally not available to the public due to high barriers of entry and non existent deal flow; geography and accreditation sometimes present issues as well. For institutions, many early stage funds deal with an illiquid seed investment in which they are married to a company for many years before any liquidity event. Inventors with promising ideas are in need of expert advice, mentorship, licensing or corporate guidance, and lastly risk capital prior to proof of concept. The Science DAO will enable crypto investors to put their crypto value into a new asset. It will help funds gain access to new deal flow with the opinion of experts in those related industries without having to seek consultation. It would foster growth for inventors and entrepreneurs that are still in need for risk capital. It would take the pressure off single investors by mitigating risk through decentralized governance and fundraising.\n\nDon't miss out on this project as it will be HUGE!\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/theory/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/theory/)\n\n[https://thesciencedao.io/](https://thesciencedao.io/)\n\n[https://thesciencedao.io/](https://thesciencedao.io/)",

POW mining allows them to dispose it while generating energy to a portable data center (miner). POS doesn't work that way. For example, if you want to run a city off of green energy. You have to build the production out so that the worst production (wind isnt blowing, sun isnt shining) meets the max consumption. Otherwise you have blackouts. However that means most the time you are producing way over what is needed and all that is wasted and gets $0. POW allows this green energy to be flexible and be 100% sold all the time. This ability to radically change the math by guaranteeing the sale of all stranded (wasted)green energy allows green energy companies to expand wind/solar/hydro/geothermal into areas that was previously not economically feasible. It used to be miners had to call alt energy companies and explain how it works. Now alt energy companies call miners.",

I log the two amounts charge x.xx and click verify card. Now this is where the problem exists that I cannot proceed further. Every time I then click verify card, I get an error on the bottom if the screen that reads \"verification not required\" and a button to click that reads Dismiss. Nothing happens and the card will not bind to my account.\n\nI have called my bank and they have confirmed that there are no restrictions or holdings to it, and I also use the same card/account on 3 other crypto platforms without any issues.\n\nI've reached out to coinbase on multiple occasions through email and social media. They won't acknowledge the issue at all and keep sending me a link to their support page on every response. It's literally the same script. Not one time do they ask for more info to diagnose, simply copy and paste and say we cannot assist any further. Obviously I have visited that site and followed all directions to no success still.\n\nThoughts?",

                            "response": "Okay, so, full disclosure. I have a friend who works for the treasury department. Here's the thing that people don't get. Inside the department there is a lot of political infighting and information gatekeeping which kind of neuters Treasury's ability to do anything quickly or effectively. Secondly, the entirety of our government is practically run by grad students in their mid 20's. They are doing 80% of the work on behalf of political appointees who ask them for information so they don't look stupid in front of press (usually doesn't work). This is true of not just treasury, but all branches of government. The Fed on the other hand is its own animal. The members of the Fed board are all political appointees, but the organization is technically private and separate from the government (kind of). They have been given a mandate by congress to maintain full employment and control inflation. Unfortunately, that should be congresses job, not the Feds. Effectively, this has forced the fed to do stupid shit (like print trillions of dollars and lower interests rates) all because congress cant get its shit together. The obvious outcome of all this is rampant inflation which is forcing the Fed to stop the money printer and increase rates. The market has been juiced up on quantitive easing (Fed printing) since 2008, so now that the party is over, markets need to correct and adjust valuations lower - hence the crash we're experiencing. I promise, there's no collusion between government organizations to cause the market to fall, it's all the consequence of shitty congressional action and poorly thought through mandates given to the Fed.  \n\nThat leaves the last group - Wall Street. In terms of market manipulation, Wall Street is a mixed bag. There are some entities that can easily profit from a market collapse (hedge funds), but a lot of entities will only hurt during a recession. People forget how asset managers make money - they take a percentage from total assets under management. If stocks fall, then their profits decline. Brokers don't like recessions either - when stocks go down, fewer people trade which results in lower profits from commissions. The last major group are Investment Banks which probably hate recessions the most - their business consists of lending money, underwriting Mergers & Acquisitions (M&As) and Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), offering brokerage services, asset management, and generating income through their trading desks. With the exception of the trading desk and (potentially) M&A's, every other business unit will lose money during a recession. The idea that these banks are trying to crash the market doesn't really make sense - they'd make significantly more money if the market went up. Hedge Funds are the only group that may be actively rooting for the market to crash; however, even the biggest hedge fund (Bridgewater Associates) isn't big enough to purposefully induce a recession (unless it blows itself up like Archeagoes). \n\nSo again, if all these groups wanted to crash the market they definitely could, but that would be stupid for everyone involved. Practically all of these groups prefer a bull market over a bear market, so the idea that they would collude is dumb.",

My question to you is, is  it worth my while to invest in companies like World Mobile Token and make investments in such markets where there are significant risks involved but also great potential benefits.  \n\n\nDo you have any other sectors that you would recommend that I invest in, and do you think my investment can be successful ?",

Which back then were pretty good.\n\nI used to trade on Binance and then I had margin acc on Bitfinex. Right now Binance only lets me withdraw. Bitfinex \"doesn't have KYC\" and you can withdraw and deposit and trade without it. But there are a lot of stories on the internet about the \"suspicious activity\" notice and how they lock your account and coins till you do the KYC.\n\nI used to buy my coins with local sites in my country but now they also have KYC. There are crypto ATMs which are in different cities and the closest is 100km from me. And not only that but I heard that even some ATMs have KYC.\n\nShould I just do the KYC and be able to buy crypto with my debit/credit card easily whenever I want but have these thoughts that my data might get leaked. Or should I do the extra hassle?",

Without encrypting it people would be able to manipulate their data by hacking their GPS or using a VPN which is very easy to do. Encrypting the data will increase the value of the data and therefore the value of the crypto earned by the community and the project itself.\n\nIn return for your data, users will receive the MMAPS token.\n\nAdvertisers (a coupon or NFT format where drivers can drive by to earn) and public/private institutions will have to purchase MMAPS tokens to make use of the business side of the app. By doing so, they will pay the community indirectly for the data shared with the MapMetrics network.\n\nBy making third parties use the same tokens as the community is earning, it will determine the fair value of the data.\n\nThe app will include the following features:\n\n**Earn crypto and NFTs While Driving**\n\nWorld\u2019s first crypto app navigation that rewards users with crypto and NFTs.\n\n**NFT Profile**\n\nUse your own NFTs to set as your profile picture for personal use or for anyone on the road to see.\n\n**Crypto Wallet**\n\nReceive all the crypto earnings you make on the road directly into your crypto wallet.\n\n**Improve Traffic Data**\n\nIncrease your earnings by updating live road traffic data to improve the platform for yourself and the community.\n\n**Web 3.0 Privacy**\n\nWith the web 3.0 approach, you will not need to use any personal data to create an account and start earning.\n\nPlease let me know what you think and if you have any questions about the project.\n\nThank you in advance!",

This was achieved with minimal marketing and tremendous teamwork.   \n\n\nMarket capitalization: US$ 2,559,714.76   \n\n\nWhat is EDAC?   \nEDAC is the tokenization of mining power. Token holders can contribute to the process of securing PoW blockchain networks while benefiting from block rewards directly with EDAC. The token is blockchain agnostic.   \n\n\nHow does it work?   \nThe process is as follows: EDAC tokens are sold and used to buy hashrate power, i.e. through rigs. This power generates mining rewards. The net proceeds (about 50% of all ETH rewards) are used to buy back EDAC coins, which will be burned immediately. This steady demand and dwindling supply should drive the price of EDAC to new all-time highs.   \n\n\nWhen an ATH is reached (not before), up to 0.5% of the token supply can be sold to buy new mining capacity, forming a virtuous circle of returns.   \n\n\nFor Edac, this is just the beginning, you may wonder why?   \n\n\nEDAC is formed by a great team where each one of them is specialized in different areas, it is clear that we have the most qualified team in this field.   \n\n\nYou can expect full functional utilities to be released soon. We will also be listed in a top50 exchange.   \n\n\nContract bep20: 0xdcde89001be4e77ed88ff0c39bffb23055659d21  \n\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/edac\\_io](https://t.me/edac_io)   \nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/edac\\_token](https://twitter.com/edac_token)   \nWeb: [https://edac.io/](https://edac.io/)",

If I decide to trade BTC/USDT, and I decide I want to buy 0.0005 BTC ($1.80USD) is that the amount the market will move in my favour or against me with each point?\n\nLet me be more specific. Let\u2019s say I decide to trade BTC/USDT, and I want to place a buy market order. The trading platform will require me to put in a certain BTC amount.\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s say I decide I want to trade 0.00005 BTC, which is $1.80USD.\u00a0\n\nDoes this mean that every time the market goes up in my favour by a point it goes up $1.80, or against me -$1.80 if it goes against me?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m asking this is because\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m a futures trader which means that I use contracts to trade.\u00a0\n\nEvery contract is worth a certain amount (i.e 1 contract is worth 0.50 cents, and every time the price goes in my favour by one point I make 0.50 cents, or if it goes against me, I lose 0.50 cents).\u00a0\n\nCan someone explain to me how this works?

It means \"sell for this price when you can\".\n\nIf you want to short sell when it drops to say 32k then set a \"stop limit\" order.

People who know how to combine these two products perfectly are those who end up getting the best out of the market and early into crypto with high potentials.",

This is one of the reasons why platforms like TFM (specifically for Terra tokens) that offer a whole section for data and analytics makes choices like this easier. Clearer and simpler variables of liquidity and volume to make comparisons with. From what I've learnt so far, there are many losses than can be prevented by regularly checking the charts",

ACH, credit cards, debit cards, etc. They're all reversable at some point. Too many exchanges have been burned over time so they simply don't allow purchasing decent amounts and immediately sending to external wallets. If this were a \\*thing\\* the exchange would be ripped off by a global network of fraudsters in under a week.  \n\nSure, some allow small amounts of say $100 or $300 here and there to be be sent immediately, but any meaningful amount will be held for some period of time. I know some exchanges allow more for established customers.  For example: \n\nIF your account is three years old, and IF your linked bank account has been used more than 50 times, and IF you haven't had any problems or issues in the past, THEN you can probably debit $3k and send it off exchange immediately. But them moment you call up support with so much as a passing question, all those factors can reset in an instant. \n\nThe only true way to get decent sized amounts into external wallets in real-time is by using cash. And the only place you can generally purchase crypto with cash is a Bitcoin ATM. You'll pay a pretty high fee, but it is the only place in the USA where you can send $5k or $10k to an external wallet immediately. \n\nGood luck.",

            "selftext": "For anyone invested in or uses Tron regularly,  and who may be using Klever's wallet application there's something I discovered when creating an HD wallet with them.\n\nIf I create an HD wallet on any other \"multi-coin\" wallet application I can import that into other apps using the mnemonic and receive the same TRX, BTC, XRP, BNB, ETH... whatever address. Trustwallet, SafePal, TronLink... All of them work correctly and will import the correct addresses.\n\nBUT if I try to import it to Klevers application it gives a new Tron TRC address, so klevr is doing something deliberate in its coding to cause this, it is using a different path to all others specifically for TRC address, as the mnemonic their app gives will not work for TRC unless it's used in their K4 or K5 wallet apps.\n\nDoing things in reverse has the same effect, you create an HD wallet on Klever, use mnemonic to import into anything else, and the TRC address will be wrong. It will not work outside of their products.\n\nSo, if you have or use an HD wallet created on their application you must back up the private key specifically for Tron, if they decided to shut down tomorrow I'm not sure how you could recover your Tron using only the mnemonic.\n\nIf anyone else knows anything else about this issue or other instances like this, please comment.",

Environmentalists have expressed worry about the impact of digital assets on the environment as a result of this. \n\nSo a lot of people in the crypto space starting going for these eco-friendly and energy efficient alternatives which include chains that run Proof-Of-Stake(PoS) consensus algorithm, some of these chains include the likes of Cardano, Algorand and Hedera.  \n\nThis technology is up to 99% more energy-efficient than PoW and guarantees high blockchain security. The difference between PoW and PoS is that instead of using supercomputers to validate transactions, users \u201cstake\u201d their coins and thus secure the chain.  \n\nThe most undervalued one amongst these in my opinion has got to be HBAR, I mean it feels like all the work and Millions in funding by the HBAR Foundation is going unnoticed, this entity also has been the backbone of development and growth on Hedera, and people shouldn't take lightly the list of tech giants in the Governing Council, those companies got money to spend. And they rarely make mistakes.  \n\nAnyways, what's in your opinion the most energy-efficient chain? According to the study above, it seems Hedera is definitely the greenest and fastest but does the price really reflect that? Not yet I think. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wpjlbepjipv81.jpg?width=1703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99114139ccd3011c2585c4215529195668afef4c",

Only a few companies have dabbled with the Metaverse at this time, with the Metaverse being in its early phases.\n\nLet me start by saying that what \"Facebook\" is doing is legitimately frowned upon, in no way, shape or form is Meta supposed to be farming our digital data, in the Metaverse. They will never succeed if they try to do so because their approach is very disrespectful and quite frankly they seem careless about the users' privacy, and the general public doesn't really trust them anymore.\n\nThat's why other big corporates and tech giants are taking the leap into the Metaverse because they saw how bad Facebook is screwing this up, a good example would be Ubisoft, a couple months ago they struck a deal with the HBAR Foundation and after a while, a $250 Million USD Metaverse Fund was raised which aims to accelerate Metaverse adoption and development on Hedera. Ubisoft is an expert in the gaming field, I'm sure great things will come seeing them work alongside an entity like the HBAR foundation.\n\nI highly believe the Metaverse is here to stay and it won't going anywhere soon, all the news we've been hearing are about more and more companies building their own Metaverse HQ along with their needed assets. Regardless, we will have people saying \"It's too early still\" or \"It's unrealistic\". My advice ? Don't listen to the people who are afraid to take risks, some people out there made millions selling virtual land, what's stopping you from doing the same ? We all gotta hit the juice some day right?",

It was first to market and as a result has market share and notoriety but I don\u2019t see it being a viable option for small players to enter the blockchain. In short, its too costly. Additionally, it\u2019s not scalable/sustainable enough for large institutions to feel comfortable risking their enterprises on something a) they\u2019re already unsure about, b) isn\u2019t fully predictable so it limits them in overall utility. \n\nSolana has the speed and has addressed the gas fees, they definitely have a long term viability for people \u201cthe peoples network\u201d. Fast, cheap, gets the job done -everything you need. Their biggest issue (afaik) is scalability/security. I don\u2019t see large companies feeling comfortable with tossing their companies into something even remotely risky let alone something that could go down. \n\nADA is secure, low fees, and scalable. Issue is development turn around is slow as hell from the peer review process, that\u2019s not ideal when you need things to be fast paced in a growing company. \u201cIf you\u2019re not first you\u2019re last\u201d is true in Ricky Bobby but especially in business. However on the flip side, this could be an ideal situation for larger institutions. Idk who all has worked at any +1000 employee company but even something as small as changing a button on a screen can take anywhere from months to a year to get sign off. I think their development schedule might actually benefit larger institutions \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nTLDR; ETH will be surpassed by Solana as the main network unless it drops gas fees, ADA will be the go to network for institutions in the long run.",

Web3 is coming. Blockchain will be exciting to watch. If you're putting money in, don't buy the eggs, buy the basket weaver and for extra safety, hedge your bets.\n\n**Capitalizing on our terms**\n\nAt this point, I am watching crypto-adjacent investment opportunities like mining or banks ($RIOT, $SI, etc) because these lend themselves to hedging strategies not possible when owning crypto outright.\n\nHere's one with 91.6% chance of winning on MarathonDH that I'm jumping on. As long as it stays above $3.88, I make up to 21.3% and have a nice 82% cushion against big negative swings.\n\nThe play: *$MARA Buy 1 $20 c, Sell 1 $25 c, Sell 6 $4 p, Exp 1/20/23*",

            "selftext": "Play-to-earn games are WEB3 games that use crypto to reward players with real-world, as well as virtual currency. The common utilized rewards can be in the form of crypto and NFTs where both can vary a lot on utility, some could give access to other real-life or even other unique virtual assets.\n\nThis year has been quite interesting for P2E investors, a lot of people made money including myself and that's just from basic, ordinary P2Es which don't really have much gameplay and are pretty much labeled as Yield Farming nowadays but regardless they fall under a P2E since some require daily input from the users.\n\nIt's possible that creators will focus more on the game's business concept than on the things that make it enjoyable. They could make unlocking an item in the game considerably more difficult, making it a draining experience for the user and taking the fun out of the process. This would defeat the whole point of playing a game, which is to have fun!\n\nThis is why, for example, I would rather invest with tech giants\u00a0like Ubisoft, which according to the HBAR Foundation is planning to build some very interesting projects on Hedera, I'm glad we can all trust this publisher to create WEB3 games that are both enjoyable and rewarding!\n\nThis partnership with Ubisoft is one of the most exciting deals that the HBAR foundation was able to strike, they really seem dedicated on rapidly funding Devs and Innovators to build on Hedera and I really think for once, P2E and GameFi is headed somewhere safe and not in the hands of some everyday Dev who'll just create another clicker-game and label it as \"P2E\" lol.\n\nHave you been a part of successful P2Es or have you only seen their negative side?",

If they aren't in circulation it means even less, the only thing they they do is prevent more supply and pressure down on the price. Burning tokens is most of the time just to build hype, if you can divide your token with for example 8 digits after 0 (No idea if this is applicable for Luna), what does a burn even mean, absolutely nothing really, it's pure hype. If they would actually buy tokens to burn from exchanges, that would possibly drive the price up because it's an increase in demand.",

Let's say you had 600000 Luna, if they burn it to a supply of 1 billion,you now have 100 Luna that are worth 6000%more than you paid, but you have 6000%less tokens. I just ballparked the numbers to get the idea across. But there is the idea that's been circulating that they may go to a pre crash snapshot and reimburse original holders, which would screw everyone that bought afterwards...hope that's not the case, and I hope the gamble pays off for everyone that took the chance",

Instead of selling them to Fiat, I didn't pay much attention and the design of CDC was sneaky so I ended up sold them to CRO. I was hoping for CRO to go up a bit so I can get them back to Fiat even money but I was so wrong now I'm down 60%. Given I am already lost a ton from UST this week, I really don't know what to do with my CRO.\n\nShould I take the loss, or you think CRO has potential to go up. Sorry guys, I know I should do my own research, but losing almost half year salary on UST made me already live like a walking corpse for days......",

You provide collateral of $100.\n\nPrice falls to $50.\n\nYou now buy back to cover the short costing you $50, and you keep the remaining $50 you borrowed, plus you get the 100 back from your collateral. Gain = 150/100-1= 50%.\n\n\nThe most you can ever gain by shorting is 100%, while your losses can be unlimited. Its the exact opposite of a long position.

And they most likely won\u2019t be able to get that money back for the fact that these kind of coins rarely ever make it through a bear market cause they rely solely on hype and have zero utility of fundamentals.\n\nHistorically, only coins with actual technology backing end end up making it through crashes and dips. Ethereum is great example of that. Also look at projects like Bitdao with with massive backing from their treasury. When you take into consideration that they have the largest treasury in the market and are the 43rd largest ETH holder, its no surprise that their price has been holding up really strong.\n\nNow compare these projects with almost all hype coins and meme coins right now and you\u2019ll see that its not even a competition. These meme coins are down REAL bad and what\u2019s worse is that they most probably won\u2019t make it back.\n\nSo save yourself the hassle. There\u2019s no fast and consistent way to make money here. You have to invest in strong fundamentals and technology and wait out for the long term instead of investing in the hype and getting rekt along the way.",

Do I understand polkadot? No, but it sounds good? It sounds like a thing that's useful? Am I just whining about being too dumb to do due diligence? I don't know. \n\nWhat I do know is paying fees to move money around and sitting around waiting for that money to move. In actually using cryptocurrency to do things I do with regular currency - functional things that need doing - I have a great deal of confidence in monero, xlm, and litecoin, because all three work nicely without being punitively expensive or ponderously slow. I haven't even really tried to research them much because I know from dumb experience that when people are going to use cryptocurrency to buy things and send money they are going to want it to work the way those do.",

Now I get to become homeless because I can't pay the taxes and move the money since I did not know any of this upfront with them and getting them to explain what the hell was going on was a nightmare, although that might be partly due to the language barrier. Yes some of this could be done better by me and I fucked it up and some of it was just shit timing as I lost my job and savings shortly after this entire event.
