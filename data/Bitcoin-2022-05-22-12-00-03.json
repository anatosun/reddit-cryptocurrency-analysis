That's progress, congratulations.\n\nMaybe, you'll click on it to watch this excerpt of an interview in which he does give some support for his assertions, which means he is making an argument. You might not agree with him, but reducing this to a title quote chosen by some random redditor to assert \"he doesn't make any argument\" feels a bit lacking in the \"argumentative\" department.\n\n> Now gtfo with your Saylor shilling. There are bigger billionaires for you to worship.\n\nI don't worship any billionaire, certainly not Saylor even if he makes good points about Bitcoin at times. The only point I've initially made is that dismissing Saylor (or anyone else) solely on the basis that they own a lot of bitcoins makes no sense, you deducing that I \"worship\" him because of this makes me think you're the one with a fixation on Saylor.",
