The issue I\u2019m having is it is stuck with the little gray circle indicating the camera is loading. I have deleted the app, tried to close it and retry about 15 times, and still the same issue. Takes a photo of my ID (front and back), and then doesn\u2019t load the camera for a selfie for whatever reason. I\u2019ve reached out to \u201csupport\u201d which was useless because it was just a bot n they said someone would get back to me. What they said was \u201coh you didn\u2019t complete the verification for your ID.\u201d\n\nYa no shit! Cuz the selfie part and the ID part are added after you\u2019ve completed the selfie step. So I\u2019m at a loss here.",
