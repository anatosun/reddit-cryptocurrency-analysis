What I am about to say has nothing to do with him being a member of any particular party or his political leanings. I am not a fan of either party.  \n\n\nAnd yes you have read the title correctly he is now under House investigation because he was essentially shilling a coin (won't mention the name of the coin if you are really interested you can easily find it ).  \n\n\nOf course this isn't your everyday reddit shilling this is high profile manipulation at its best (allegedly) with him being accused of having financial interest in a coin he previously promoted.  \n\n\nFor me this is beyond disgusting, crypto is supposed to be something above centralization, above government something that should be the future of finance and the beginning of something new in every area of tech and any crypto company found to be engaged in such manipulation should be removed from Coinbase, Durafi, Binance, every exchange  you can name  because the very essence of Cryptocurrencies is contradictory to such actions.  \n\n\nDo you share my beliefs and do you think crypto should be left outside politics and vice versa because I absolutely do.",

People shouldnt assume that just because they are using Crypto, laws don't apply to them.\n\nCawthorn's case is different , though. He thinks he is above the law because he's a well-connected Republican, and he's probably right.",
