Almost anyone that bought xrp bought into the idea ripple might carve out a huge chunk of the market for itself in the banking/financial sector. Xrp was given to ripple, ripple then sold it to fund their own business operations (a single common enterprise) to the general public, indiscriminately. I won\u2019t get into how that makes no sense since their product was for banks and not the general public. But suffice to say most people didn\u2019t consider their purchase a charitable donation. Most people purchased with the expectation of a return through no effort of their own (passive returns). The exchange of money for passive returns in a single enterprise that ripple execs heavily promoted as a successful investment following their price manipulation tactics and tv interviews that followed\u2026 it\u2019s a security. Ripple is not at all decentralised. They claim it is decentralised and open source but only ripple employed developers are making 99% of the code changes .. so If ripple dies, xrpl dies with it which is the opposite of what has been claimed all along .. that it would continue to survive and thrive without them. Blatantly it would not. It would fall by the wayside and die.\n\nDon\u2019t listen to all the shills saying otherwise.",
