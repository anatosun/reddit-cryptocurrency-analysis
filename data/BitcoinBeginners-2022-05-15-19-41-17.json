Maker / Taker fees are respectively 0.16% / 0.26% and withdrawal fees for Bitcoin are 0.00001 BTC or even free if you withdraw via Lightning Network. Kraken has very good security features and a top-notch 24/7 customer support which can be really useful if you're just starting out. Here you can find a breakdown of [trading fees](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/features/fee-schedule/#kraken-pro) and [withdrawal fees](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000767986-Cryptocurrency-withdrawal-fees-and-minimums) for Kraken.\n\nFTX is nice because of the lower trading fees (Maker 0.02% - Taker 0.07%) but I was not happy with the overall experience. Here you can find a breakdown of [trading fees](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024479432-Fees) and [withdrawal fees](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034865571-Blockchain-Deposits-and-Withdrawals) for FTX.\n\nIf you're willing to consider another option, check Gemini. Their trading fees are just slightly higher than Kraken (Maker / Taker fees are respectively 0.20% / 0.40%) and they offer 10 free BTC withdrawals per month. In all honestly, I like their trading interface more than Kraken. Here you can find a breakdown of [trading fees](https://www.gemini.com/fees/activetrader-fee-schedule#section-active-trader-fee-schedule) and [withdrawal fees](https://www.gemini.com/fees/transfer-fee-schedule) for Gemini.\n\nTL;DR: If you reside in Europe and want to buy Bitcoin on a regulated exchange, consider Kraken and Gemini.\n\nKeep stacking.",
