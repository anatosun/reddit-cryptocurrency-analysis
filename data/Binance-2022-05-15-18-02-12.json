I submitted a ticket to support.binance.com, but it was closed with an unsatisfactory response. I tried again, but they closed it without responding. Not sure what to do now. Binance.com scammed me? I'm not sure how i lost $6500. I'm not sure what to do because I've lost all I had, absolutely everything, and the Binance.com team isn't responding. I don't have any money in the bank and have lost my life savings. I hope this does not happen to anyone else.\n\npair = LUNA/USDT -- Isolatedmy entry price was somewhere around $1.2..liquidated somewhere around $1.2172..leverage  was less than 10x..\n\nshort time = 12 May 2022, 1 a.m. IST\n\nedit \u2013 short time, grammar and minor details  \nscreenshot -- [https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/924006976755744831/975001820982304808/unknown.png?width=1440&height=415](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/924006976755744831/975001820982304808/unknown.png?width=1440&height=415)",
