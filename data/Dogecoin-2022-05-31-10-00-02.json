It\u2019s a really really bad idea.\n\nAnd, completely unnecessary.\n\nAll you really need is a bunch of text wallets, stored offline on multiple removable media, alongside local copies of the coinb.in website so you can sign transactions offline. 100% safe, free, cold storage.\n\nSearch here for \u2018text wallet\u2019 and have a read.",
