The more important number is net new generation devoted to bitcoin.  No one has tried to track it that I'm aware of, but it should be close to zero - maybe around 20% of power used by bitcoin.\n\nThe reason is that bitcoin miners have an incentive to use the cheapest electricity they can.  That usually means buying electricity that is already being generated, but not used.  I forget the exact number, but something like 20% of electricity generated isn't used for anything at all.  It's not really wasted, because you have to have extra capacity for the grid to work properly.  But it is available for use cheaply if you have a load that can immediately shut down when the power is needed elsewhere.  There are also situations where power is produced, but can't be transported for various reasons.  Bitcoin mining is perfect for both of these situations.\n\nBitcoin mining uses a lot less electricity than it appears to because most of it just uses unneeded or unusable electricity.  We need to figure out exactly what the numbers are here and use those if we want to debate environmentalists.",
