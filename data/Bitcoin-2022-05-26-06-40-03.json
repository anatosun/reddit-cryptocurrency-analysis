If you are consolidating a lot of small transactions it could add up, but most transactions will be very cheap. If the mempool is full, you might have to wait longer. If you\u2019re in a Rush you can choose to increase the fee, but if you are just sending these to yourself to move wallets, or consolidating smaller amounts, just set it low and wait.",

At some given block to convert blockchain into a list of wallet ballances (and, second thing, maybe, discard small balances in the process). This thing is in reality done by retail databases to decrease size of the movement record of goods and of amount of calculation needed for leftover goods. Retail shops buy, sell, move goods from storage to another and to calculate amount of any particular item can involve re-processing all its movements since it arrived in organization. So they periodically calculate balances of all their items in stock set new date as a starting point and discard everything that was before the set date. Hope this make sense. I did not count on blockchain, but have a strong feeling it will shrink considerably. Ps. Sorry, English isn't my native language",
