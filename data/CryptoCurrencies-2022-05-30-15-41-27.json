The reason that Cardano development is so slow is that it the chain is tested thoroughly and every implementation, feature and release is peer reviewed. And the peer reviews get peer reviewed aswell. Not doing so speeds up your development of course, but at what cost? Look at LUNA. Look at ETH with the insane gas fees.",
