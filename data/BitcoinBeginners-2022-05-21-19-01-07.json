I think most wallets, software, and hardware, don't really have a sustainable solid business model.  Wasabi wallet and samurai wallet charge for certain transactions and they both have had VC investments. The economic considerations are definitely second thought to most wallet creators. The crypto space seems stuck in the idea that you get the traffic first, then you get profit from that traffic type mentality that is prevalent in other software-based areas.",
