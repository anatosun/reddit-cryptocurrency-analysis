            "selftext": "Hi. I took some time this week playing around with a new debate platform called Kialo which might be a nice pattern for structuring and adding rigor to arguments which happen so often between BTC and BCH.\n\nThis is just a proof of concept at this point. As a starting point, last weekend I asked for some of your arguments [in favor of Bitcoin Cash's scaling approach](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/upbpzn/for_or_against_bitcoin_cash_has_a_better_scaling/). (Yes, this is just one side, but it's primarily for testing at this point.)\n\nI tried to build out some of the claims which lead up to the above argument, while also adding some support for/against underneath. Hopefully, this illustrates the platform's capability.\n\nI've included a link which anyone can use to make comments and suggestions to the discussion. If this experiment goes well, I will continue to add to it as well as open it up to the public for further contributions/discourse.\n\nPlease share feedback on all aspects of this. Any feedback about the arguments themselves should be added to Kialo. Any meta feedback should go in this thread. Eager to hear your thoughts, r/btc. \ud83c\udf7b\n\nhttps://www.kialo.com/p/4625da49-6139-48d4-9935-33402490e0ea/58272",
