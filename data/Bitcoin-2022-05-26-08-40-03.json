It will also increase mental health and well being\n- A decrease in violence and increase in mental health well being will decrease school shootings.",

I have added a few, of course I cannot add everything.\n\nMy point is that restricting gun freedoms will not magically make (gun) violence disappear. As can be seen from my links.\n\nIt will cause that only the bad people have guns, which I don't think is a desirable situation.\n\nAnd even IF you could effectively reduce gun violence with laws (not possible, but let's entertain the idea for a moment), the psychos will just use cars to drive into people. As can be seen here:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_attack_on_the_Dutch_royal_family\n\nSo yeah, no.\n\n>\tThe USA has 2, per month.\n\nThe USA also has a far greater population than the Netherlands. Of course your share of psychos will increase as well.",
