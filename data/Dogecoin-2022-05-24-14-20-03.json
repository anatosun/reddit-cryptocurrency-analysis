This wallet keeps your crypto keys offline, it generates a 24 words password seed phrase, that password is everything you need to keep your keys safe, even if you damage or lost your hardware wallet you will be fine as long as you have your 24 words seed phrase, you can restore it with a new device, I just moved out my keys out of robinhood, it's really easy to do.",
