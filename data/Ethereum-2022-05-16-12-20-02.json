            "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI have some WETH (wrapped ETH) in my Coinbase Wallet. The WETH is on the Polygon blockchain. I want to sell the WETH and was hoping someone could provide guidance on how I can do this? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem possible to convert the WETH to ETH using Coinbase Wallet and I can\u2019t transfer the WETH to my Coinbase account as there is no option to deposit WETH to Coinbase. I also can\u2019t convert the WETH to any other coin such as USDT and then transfer the USDT to Coinbase - Coinbase Wallet says I needs for example $0.07 MATIC to proceed. I have some MATIC in my Coinbase account but the MATIC is on the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nIs there any way I can transfer the MATIC I have in my Coinbase account, which is on the Ethereum blockchain, to the Polygon blockchain to pay fees to convert the WETH to USDT? Or alternatively is there any other way that I can get the WETH out of Coinbase Wallet and sell it?\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated \ud83d\ude04",

I use crypto.com, but I'm sure there are others.\n\nStep 2: Withdraw MATIC to your wallet, making sure it's on the Polygon network and not ERC20.\n\nStep 3: use a DeFi exchange (I use uniswap) to convert your wETH to MATIC on the Polygon network. Gas fees should be <$0.01.\n\nStep 4: Send your new MATIC back to your exchange. Remember to keep some in your wallet so you can do this again later without repeating Steps 1 and 2. Convert it to whatever currency you want. \n\nRepeat Step 3-4 as often as you want. I usually wait until I get a few payouts from mining before converting.\n\nHope this helps. GL.",
