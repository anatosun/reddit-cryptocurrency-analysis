Coinbase proceeded and locked both my coinbase account and coinbase pro account. I tried to get support but they will not even read the complaint all they did is keep rattling about how I need to pay the $509 before my account can be unlocked. Non of these support people will even mention the main issue which is that I was charged twice. I finally was able to send USDC from another wallet to settle the reversal and now they have closed the case even though they still owe me $509. I uploaded documents and all but non of them will even acknowledge it. This is terrible.",

As a customer it was never explained to me what the transfer hold is, or what the ticket was pertaining to or what the conclusion of the ticket was when it was closed.. what kind of business practice is this.. My trust in coinbase has been erased I cannot use your service any more in fear of my funds being on hold with no explanation as to why.",

In whatever county you live in, file a Small Claims action against Coinbase. It only costs $63 here in my county in NC. Hi d say chances are, they do NOT send a representative to defend the case, and you will get a judgment for $509, or for however much you have been damaged - keep in mind that Small Claims actions (in my state) are only for disputes under $10,000. Sounds to me like you e gone thru a lot, and there's no telling how much you would've gained if that issue had not occurred. I'd file the action for $9,500, and bring all of the correspondence to your court date. Most of the time, there are no lawyers in small claims court. You present your evidence, then the other side presents their's. If they do not show up, the Judge will grant you a default judgment for however much you are asking for in the complaint. I'm pretty sure you'll have to file the action, then give notice by mailing a copy of the filed complaint to the address of the Registered Agent of Coinbase. You'll have to find out that address on your own, but you'll also (most likely) need to send notice (copy of filed complaint) to the Secretary of State's office in your state (along with $10 or $20 per defendant = 1) check their website to make sure you've done it properly, I promise it's not hard. Good luck. Feel free to message me if you need to.",
