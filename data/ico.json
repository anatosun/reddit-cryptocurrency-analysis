However cryptocurrencies are something very special and unique. They provide a means of peer to peer payments not seen by this world until Bitcoin entered the seen almost a decade ago.\n\nCryptocurrencies (ex. Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc..) provide an opportunity to fight traditional financial problems and inequality across the globe.There are several delays and exorbitant fees associated with traditional money transfers or payments across international borders. Did you know cryptocurrency allows people to transfer funds anywhere, anytime, almost fee free? When we compare this technology to traditional banking its amazing what a difference blockchain technology has made in the Fintech and banking worlds.\n\nEven as we start this company, VegaWallet has had to deal with these outdated platforms to conduct business. We\u2019ve had to wait to send checks, we\u2019ve had to wait for wire transfers to clear and arrive days later. We\u2019ve seen the fees collected and even dealt with the problems associated with this outdated process. If more companies and people were to accept blockchain backed cryptocurrencies for business and personal reasons the global consumer economy could save millions if not billions of dollars per year. We could also avoid wait times and conduct business almost instantly as payments clear the public ledgers.\n\nThese problems even trickle down to the regular person across the world, especially in economies where most people remain unbanked or banking services remain scarce. Did you know if a person was to send money home to his family after working hard as can be, the wire transfer or money service he would most likely use charges him up to 15\u201320% on the dollar. If this same payment home was sent in cryptocurrency not only would it get there instantly but most of the time any fees seen would be under 1% of the total payment (depending on cryptocurrency and platform used).\n\nCryptocurrency wallets are available to anyone with access to a smartphone, computer, or the internet in general. Unlike banks this technology is a lot easier to access even in developing countries. Any person will be able to download VegaWallet and be \u201ctheir own bank account\u201d by controlling their digital assets (i.e. cryptocurrency). Our technology provides them ways to send and receive almost instantly with fees so minimal you\u2019ll barely see a difference in the delivered amount. It also provides up to date fiat related pricing and options to withdraw or deposit funds in several local currencies in order to pay bills or buy necessities at locations that do not yet accept this technology. Digital asset wallets provide a form of greater funds security over traditional cash. With our 2FA technology your funds remain safe no matter what and it\u2019s not as easily lost or taken by theft when compared to fiat money. If you were to lose your phone or computer as long as you can provide credentials to log-in you can access your account and funds. If something were to happen, most of the time those same funds stored in cash would forever be lost.\n\nVegaWallet has not only seen the need to protect consumers in these times but also create a system to protect businesses as well. Did you know that our Initial Coin Offering funds are being put towards the development of our Point of Sale system and a platform we call \u201cVegaPay\u201d?\n\nThe Point of Sale System will allow any business to accept cash, credit, or cryptocurrency for use in the retail or service industry. This means that local economies where inflation plays a key role in economic downturn will be able to completely substitute outdated technology with our state of the art platform. The point of sale will also provide businesses with several services such as employee information tracking, payroll, and inventory/audit logs.\n\nOur personal favorite part about the point of sale system just so happens to be the cryptocurrency related tech. Our VGW token will be the backbone of the point of sale system and provide businesses and consumers with many extended options including a Loyalty and Rewards program built around cryptocurrency. But what if you\u2019re a business accepting cryptocurrency and are worried about volatility or paying your bills in traditional fiat currencies? We have you covered! The system will automatically provide the option to place sell orders through our native exchange at the end of the day and deposit fiat funds obtained from these orders directly to your bank account. This protects businesses from the rollercoaster pricing history of some major cryptocurrencies and allows them to stay on top of business in a way never before seen in the crypto-sphere. Another option for businesses to unload their crypto wallets is to sell that currency directly back to customers at check out. If a customer comes into your store and is interested in purchasing cryptocurrency you can provide this service as easily as providing the option to buy a gift card. The customer then provides their VegaWallet information and the funds are deposited directly into their account.\n\nModern cryptocurrency financial services allow developing countries to improve quality of life. An economic platform such as VegaWallet functioning as the backbone for this economy could help even developed countries see a large influx of businesses and money transfers to help fight economic downturn. Cryptocurrencies in general have the means to completely change financial systems in place and allow for greater fund distribution through out the world. This technology is not only limited to the unbanked population but can also make huge improvements over modern banking systems.\n\nWritten by: Jacob Ballou\u200a\u2014\u200aCo-Founder & Chief Creative Officer at VegaWallet",

It is based on supplying USDC as liquidity to the UNITS protocol in return for UNIT tokens at a discounted price.  Bonds are locked up for a period of 5 days, with an auto stake mechanism which is highly effective in boosting the rewards. \n\nThe UNITS protocol is currently at its' early bird stage\n\n  \n\n**How does Bonding work?**\n\n**\u200c**Upon supplying the bond pool with USDC, the protocol quotes a discounted price for the UNIT token. The supplied USDC is converted into UNIT tokens according to the discounted UNIT price and automatically staked in order to boost he rewards. So, by bonding you benefit both from a  predefined discount and boosted rewards for auto staking.\u200cThe bond can be redeemed in UNIT tokens together with its rewards after 5 day period.**\u200c**The bond staking rewards are distributed linearly during the bond pool lifespan (90 day). \n\n \n\n**\u200cWhat are the benefits of Bonding?\u200c**\n\nBonding is an active short term investment with high ROI based on predefined discount for the UNIT tokens. The auto staking mechanism is rewarding investors with high APR in addition to the short term bond profit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Participate in bonding now ->** [**https://app.units.finance/#/bond**](https://app.units.finance/#/bond)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Roadmap**\n\nThe UNITS Protocol is pleased to share its development roadmap timeline.\n\n# Q1 - 2021\n\n* Building the team.\n* Design the concept architecture.\n* Seed funding\n\n# Q2 - 2021\n\n* Fork Uniswap liquidity mining smart contract \n* Fork Uniswap vesting smart contract \n* Fork Yearn\u2019s Woofy smart contract \n* Development and documentation of bond smart contract \n* Development and documentation of UNITS Protocol user interface \n* Development and documentation of UNITS DAO governance token smart contract\n\n# Q3 - 2021\n\n* Development and documentation of muBTC smart contract \n* Development and documentation of liquidity mining smart contract \n* Deploy Bond smart contract to testnet \n* Deploy muBTC smart contact to testnet \n* Deploy liquidity mining smart contract to testnet \n* Development and documentation of UNITS Protocol user interface \n* Deploy UNITS DAO governance token smart contract to testnet\n\n# Q4 - 2021\n\n* Deploy UNITS DAO governance token to BSC and Polygon mainnet \n* Deploy UNIT token vesting to BSC and Polygon mainnet \n* Deploy Bond smart contract to BSC and Polygon mainnet \n* Deploy muBTC smart contact to BSC and Polygon mainnet \n* Launch Genesis Bonding Launch Genesis Mining for muBTC \n* Launch Public Listing \n* Deploy liquidity mining smart contract to BSC and Polygon mainnet \n* Launch staking pool \n* Launch voting space on Snapshot\n\n# Q1 - 2022\n\n* Create Partnerships & collaborations with wallets and exchanges \n* Development and documentation of muBTC collateral investment strategy smart contract \n* Development and documentation of buyback smart contract \n* Development and documentation of MAU multi-asset stablecoin smart contract\n\n# Q2-2022\n\n* Deploy buyback smart contract to testnet \n* Deploy MAU multi-asset stablecoin smart contract on testnet \n* Development and documentation of MAU collateral investment strategy smart contract\n\n# Q3 - 2021\n\n* Deploy MAU multi-asset stablecoin smart contract to mainnet \n* Launch Genesis Mining for MAU \n* Launch MAU stablecoin to DEXs \n* Deploy MAU collateral investment strategy smart contract to testnet\n\n# Q4 - 2022\n\n* Deploy MAU collateral investment strategy smart contract to mainnet \n* Launch MAU stablecoin to CEXs \n* Deploy MAU on other Ethereum L2\n\n\u200b\n\n**Staking**  \n\n\n**Get outstanding rewards while keeping your exposure to Bitcoin.** The muBTC staking pool is where you can stake your muBTC tokens and earn rewards in UNIT tokens.  \n**Staking UNITS DAO Tokens is a passive, long-term strategy.** Keeping UNIT tokens staked is the most effective way to maintain the token value.

            "text": "Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain have received a great deal of attention in the past few years. However, software development in this field is hard for many. Most Blockchain platforms are currently working on the distribution concerns but they are unable to increase the speed of transactions and private keys are also lost due to mismanagement. Hence, these platforms are not good enough to be deployed on devices like mobile phones.\n\nIn spite of Blockchain\u2019s continuous struggles, consensus mechanism is unable to work properly. A new cryptocurrency named Mixin has arrived on the horizon and delivered a solution to tackle this problem.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dltfzz3nv5t11.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b06fc3335d3448c137f4a7b13fe69533cb0a8100\n\nIn order to achieve cross chain functionality and scalability, Mixin has developed a network of distributed ledgers that function under a directed acyclic graph design (or DAG).\n\nA DAG is a uniquely designed mechanism for distributed ledger nodes to achieve consensus. Unlike blockchains, which relay information in a linear pattern (from one block to the next), a DAG uses a \u2018gossip protocol\u2019 to disperse information randomly between multiple nodes, allowing consensus on transactions to be achieved faster.\n\nThe Mixin network consists of many supporting ledgers called \u2018domains\u2019 and \u2018domain extensions\u2019. At the center of these domain ledgers is the \u2018Kernel\u2019, which is the core ledger.\n\nEach type of ledger serves a unique purpose within the Mixin Network:\n\n* Domains act as a gateway for assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, other Blockchains, and even central bank fiat currencies to feed into the Kernel.\n* Domain extensions store smart contracts and trusted application data from Blockchains like Ethereum, EOS, etc.\n* The Kernel functions as the command center for Domain and Domain extension distributed ledgers. Its main function is to provide faster verification for digital asset transactions via the DAG and \u2018gossip consensus\u2019 protocol.\n\nTo solve this problem, the [Mixin Network](https://mixin.one/) is creating a cross\u2011chain solution that consists of three core features:\n\n* *A public chain Mixin Network*\n* *A digital wallet + Mixin Messenger App*\n* *A Decentralized exchange called \u2018Ocean.ONE\u2019*\n\nWith the provision of these features, the Mixin Network is aiming to be more than just another public blockchain. It\u2019s also aiming to be a solution that enhances the entire blockchain ecosystem.\n\nFor more information about Mixin, please visit: [https://mixin.one](https://mixin.one/)",

It is a cryptocurrency that is linked to both Ethereum and Bitcoin, which allows to take advantage from the mining activity of Ethereum, and obtain returns from it without having the required technical knowledge nor the necessary machinery. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn February 1, 2022, EDAC has obtained a positive rating from an Auditrate technology auditing firm, as well as the proof of vexed team . \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, the initial offer will start at the end of February. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere have been other projects that claimed to be dedicated to cryptocurrency mining, but they typically were pyramidal frauds and scams, which raised capital by offering unsustainable interest. There are also public companies trading in Stock markets. What distinguishes EDAC and what makes the project unique is that all processes are carried out in a decentralized way in the Ethereum blockchain, and through a DAO, which will be in charge of deciding the most important strategic and tactical decisions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo at this time EDAC will focus on mining Ethereum cryptocurrencies while watching son this blockchain continues to use proof-of-work technology, because it is the most profitable at the moment. But later on, it will continue betting on this technology, which is the one that guarantees greater decentralization and fair access to all participants. Whether mining bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency based on proof of work mining, the operation of the EDAC Project is as follows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDAC tokens are sold and used to buy hashrate power, i.e. through rigs. This power generates mining rewards. The net income (around 50% of all ETH rewards) is used to buyback EDAC coins, which will immediately be burnt. This constant demand and decreasing supply should impulse EDAC price to new All-Time Highs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen an ATH is reached (not before, thus guarantying a scarcity of supply), up to a 0.5% of token supply can be sold to buy new mining capacity, conforming a virtuous circle of returns.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, 1% of trading volume will be redistributed in bitcoins (wrapped bitcoins) among holders automatically with a transaction fee.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite:  [https://edac.io](https://edac.io)\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/edac\\_io](https://t.me/edac_io)\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/edactoken](https://twitter.com/edactoken)\n\nContract ERC-20: [https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a1f2e827f9d35fd3b599ac253b33cb6e19ff556](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a1f2e827f9d35fd3b599ac253b33cb6e19ff556)",

Faireum focuses on the gambling industry through this decentralized structure and offering low cost for gambling transactions, a transparent design for providers and safe gaming experience for users. The Faireum blockchain is designed to provide these features in a competitive structure.  \nFaireum blockchain uses the best features of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyperledger. The combination of all these best components, Faireum has been designed to cover the gaps in the gambling industry in an innovative, safe and technological way.  \nIt is a blockchain platform with an Application Programming Interface (API) that is suitable for third-party business providers to access through the consensus mechanism and the Faireum Virtual Machine (FVM). The Faireum main blockchain uses the Web Assembly (WASM) virtual machine as the default runtime for smart contracts and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) + Delegated Proof-of-stake (DPos) as the consensus mechanism.\n\nThe random number from Faireum blockchain is not just data that can be deduced from the program. Combined with the block hash and zero-knowledge proofs, it is not possible to deduced or predict our random number generator by using an inverse. We refer to this algorithm as Zero Random Algorithm (ZRA).\n\nIn addition to ZRA algorithm, the Faireum blockchain is pre-configured with several other Random Number Generators (RNGs), including Faireum Random Digital (FRD), dedicated to digital games, Faireum Random Casino (FRC), dedicated to casino games, and a dynamic probability balance index generator, called Faireum Dynamic Betting (FDB), which is preset for real-time results such as sports quizzes.  \n**THE NEED FOR FAIREUM?**  \nFaireum's is needed to enable everyone to have fair access to betting practices. Faireum aims to create a completely fair and transparent gaming environment using the best blockchain solutions. However, Faireum team is working as an ecosystem to improve day by day and to provide users with an extraordinary gaming experience. For these purposes, the team aims to be an open ecosystem in which users can play their games with the high-security protocol.\n\n**The Purpose of Faireum**\n\nFaireum's goal is to enable all people to have fair access to gambling and betting practices. Faireum aims to create a completely fair and transparent gaming environment using the best blockchain solutions. However, Faireum team is working as an ecosystem to improve day by day and to provide users with an extraordinary gaming experience. For these purposes, the team aims to be an open ecosystem in which users can play their games with the high-security protocol.\n\n**SOLUTIONS FAIREUM WANTS TO OFFER**  \n1.Minimization of fraud risk.  \n2.Enabling game developers to make money with their works easily.  \n3.Creating an ecosystem for the gambling industry in a fair and reliable way.  \n4.Providing a reliable and transparent service within the framework of Faireum protocols.  \n5.Creating an official platform on the Faireum network for the completely transparent gaming experience.\n\n**Main Elements of Faireum Ecosystem**\n\n**Transparency:** The Faireum ecosystem is completely transparent. All the records from the user's deposits, money withdrawals and the results of the game are stored in a database that everyone can easily access. With the principle of transparency, players can play their games with no question mark in their minds.\n\n**Reliability:** Faireum's main goal is to create a safe gaming environment. The features required for a safe gaming environment are made possible through smart contracts. A user in the Faireum system is completely confident that the rules specified will not change later.\n\n**Security:** One of the biggest problems of the betting and gambling industry is security vulnerabilities. Faireum have a decentralized structure. Therefore, users are responsible for their own security. Because of this decentralized structure, the probability of any hacking or fraud is greatly reduced. Faireum offers its users completely safe gaming experience.\n\n**Roadmap of the Faireum**\u00a0\n\nWhen i look at the Faireum road map in the first quarter of 2019, there are stages of ICO preparation and establishment of the platform. The purpose of listing in the second quarter of stock exchanges is the development of the test network which will accelerate the project. Faireum wallet development and publishing of games from the third quarter development, which is the continuation of the short-term plans, will be an important part of the ecosystem. The roadmap looks consistent in every aspect.\n\nWebsite: [https://faireum.io/](https://faireum.io/)\n\nWhitepaper: [https://faireum.io/assets/files/Faireum\\_whitepaper2.0\\_En.pdf](https://faireum.io/assets/files/Faireum_whitepaper2.0_En.pdf)\n\nBounty0x ID: ecamli\n\n&#x200B;",

Consequently, citizens across the world have become more conscious of their data and where it may be shared. Enter mainstream blockchain, also known as distributed ledger technology (DLT).\nAlthough by no means new, blockchain certainly remains a very exciting technology that is still in the early stages of being explored. Thanks to its decentralized form, sophisticated security algorithms, and immutable nature, blockchain enables a lasting record of all transactions, which is why it\u2019s so often associated with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum. Without revealing any personal information, blockchain records precisely who owns which crypto coin through a global network of decentralized ledgers.\nWhy is privacy important in DeFi Sector?\nPrivacy is very important. You can\u2019t have true crypto adoption if all your transactions are public on the blockchain ledger. You won\u2019t like your competitors to know about all your transactions in your professional life, plus not the investors because of potential FOMO/FUD. Similarly, you won\u2019t like the whole world in your personal life knowing what you recently bought, what services you took, etc. Since blockchain stores the history of all transactions in the public ledger, any third-party observer can analyze it and use it to deanonymize network participants by combining this information with other data obtained about them.\nUsers interact with the DeFi ecosystem through smart contracts. Due to the transparency of all data stored in the blockchain, keeping sensitive data in the smart contracts is a bad idea, as the data on the volumes and terms of the transaction is visible to everyone. Blockchain technology is based on principles that provide a sufficiently high level of anonymization, which is why more and more companies that need a high level of privacy are exploring the possibilities of distributed systems.\nPrivacy in DeFi means that it is impossible to obtain such data, which can be used to identify a wallet or address owner. We would like to take a closer look at examples of projects and solutions that are working to improve the level of DeFi system members\u2019 privacy.\n \nWho is providing privacy in DeFi?\n\u00b7       Veruseum\nVerusesum strives to build a robust financial platform that brings in both audibility and privacy in one. The specialized solutions for an array of use cases by Verusesum enable thousands of transactions per second, handcrafted to ensure higher efficiency compared to generic techniques offered by other L2 solutions like ZK Rollups.\n\u00b7       Plasm Network\nPlasm Network can be another great example of the same. It is a dApps hub on Polkadot that supports Ethereum and layer2 solutions like ZK Rollups. Their main aim is to support multiple blockchains and virtual machines like EVM and WASM.\nAave\nAave is one of the most popular and leading lending protocols in the DeFi landscape. It utilizes the native token AAVE for the security of the protocol alongside enabling users to participate in the governance of the protocol. Users can stake AAVE tokens through the Safety Module for achieving AAVE rewards.\n \nData privacy surely is an important thing to consider, be Defi or any other sector. Some information is too delicate to be public and can do a great deal of harm.",

Unifi utilizes the time-tested SEED Bridge to connect any Ethereum or EVM/NVM-based DeFi products to other blockchains. It is seen as a great investment for future returns by investors on BSC.\n\n\u00b7Jade Protocol\nThe Fair Fork Foundation has recently come up with Jade Protocol, an improved fork of the initially launched Olympus DAO on Binance Smart Chain, powered by the SmartCoin team. It is a great project for some high-yield passive income.  The APRs have gone up to 1,000,000,000% following the initial listing on the Binance smart chain.\n\n\u00b7Hard Protocol\nHARD Protocol is the world's first multi-chain money market for cryptocurrencies enabling users to borrow, lend, and earn interest on the assets. HARD Protocol is built on the Kava platform leveraging its safe, secure, and reliable DeFi infrastructure to deliver its money market product globally to anyone, anywhere.\n\n\u00b7Filecoin\nFilecoin is a decentralized storage network based on the Interplanetary File Storage (IPFS) protocol. It is designed to utilize unused storage globally into an efficient storage market for users to pay for low-cost storage. The objective is to ensure file storage is permanent and distributed across the web. Contrast this with centralized cloud storage solutions such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or Dropbox, where data are stored in servers owned by these private corporations.\n\nBinance has always been the first choice for investors. How do you think these new and upcoming projects will perform on the Binance smart chain?",

            "text": "- Scalability  \r\n\nMinedBlock\u2019s service is endlessly scalable, in order to grow the service minedblock simply would \rinstall and configure more mining equipment. There isn\u2019t any technical limitation to how big \rit could get. MinedBlock has the ability to quickly and easily expand into multiple revenue \r\nstreams including, but not limited to, expansion of the range of mined crypto assets and the \rability to host private mining services.\r\n\n- Agility\n\r\nInitially, 40% of our infrastructure will be dedicated to cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin, this \rwill enable the service to flex and switch between the asset being mined allowing us to \ralways target the assets with the best returns based on market demand. The 60% initial \rallocation to Bitcoin can also be adjusted based on market prices and returns. \r\n\n- Sustainability\n\r\nMinedBlock is focussed on hosting our infrastructure in areas that can provide 100% \rrenewable energy. \r\n\nMarket Immunity \r\n\nPhase 2 of the project, which is out of scope for this round of funding, will be to build our \rown renewable energy sources to offset electricity costs, the primary ongoing cost factor, \rthus enabling continuous revenue production regardless of crypto market prices.\r\n\nProjected Revenue \r\n\nMinedBlock will produce revenue through mining a strategically selected range of\r\ncryptocurrencies. Another way to \u2018mine\u2019 crypto is to buy and hold a minimum number of a \rcoin in a wallet which entitles the holder to a share of transaction fees (similar to earning \rinterest on a savings account). This is known as a \u2018Proof of Stake\u2019 method of mining. \r\nPublishing a wallet for Proof of Stake mining is called hosting a masternode. There are always\r new technological advances in the mining industry including strategies and technologies \rwhich we are prepared to adopt and add to our service.\r\nThe return on investment, in terms of profits, ranges from 6% to 75% of the initial investment \reach month depending on the wider Crypto market. This represents an estimated range of\r 72% to 900% ROI over a year. At this stage any exit strategy could be represented by a public \rflotation or a full management buyout.\r\nAssuming we successfully raise $15m and considering the current crypto market prices we \rforecast a turnover of ~$23.6m with total company profits of ~$14.3m in year one. If the \rcrypto market stays as it is today, then year two would bring around a 20% increase in \rrevenue and profit.\n\nUnique Selling Point (USP) \r\n\nOur USP compared to the competition is that we plan to make ourselves fully immune from \rthe market, prioritise our investors (over ourselves) and be 100% transparent in everything \rwe say and do. \r\nMost other mining firms have focused on just \u2018out of the box\u2019 mining and not considered any \rform of cost reduction or alternative revenue generation such as masternodes, and this has \rleft them unprofitable and unable to continue. \r\nOur aims go far beyond \u2018just being another mining company\u2019 we intend to dominate the \rspace as quickly as possible. At this stage, there isn\u2019t really any meaningful competitor in the \rmarketplace as the mining industry is still in its infancy.\n\nFind out more information about the project and how it intends to implement its technology and system by accessing the official channels below:\n\nhttps://www.minedblock.io\n\nhttps://www.minedblock.io/assets/MinedBlockWhitepaper.pdf\n\nhttps://twitter.com/mined_block\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MinedBlock/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MinedBlock\n\n\nBounty0x Username: sprintx24",

After the ICO, Faireum ICO will fully implement and run an online betting platform supported by Faireum ICO blockchain framework. It will focus on users, players and developers and service providers, and Faireum net-based protocols and incentives to provide a more perfect and healthy gaming ecosystem.\n\nThis system can provide a P2P marketplace for game developers and support a large number of independent front-end platforms where players can discover and play gambling and betting games. We will be providing the platform on a smart contract with other third-party developers to leverage on with the end goal being the creation of a global, decentralized system, where any barrier and central authority is eliminated, and where players would enjoy a fast, fair and secure online gambling experience.\n\nWith the act of creating a new blockchain based on the Faireum ICO protocol and custom features to meet Online Gambling requirements, Faireum ICO will remove the risk inherent in the current system by making it decentralized, transparent and trustless.\n\nFaireum Economic Plan\n\nThe main revenue stream of Faireum ICO will come from developers\u2019 commission-based revenue. The business model will focus on attracting users via marketing activities, empowering users and creating a global community of players who want to participate in the network.\nFaireum ICO will operate a platform with a high margin of profit from developers and other parties in the ecosystem through the provision of several plans:\n\nDeveloper plan. Developers can write the games and Dapps with Solidity or other programming languages and are not limited to publishing smart contracts to the Faireum ICO Blockchain network. Faireum ICO will charge a transaction fee for publishing a smart contract and charge a listing fee for listing the game on the FSN. For games or Dapps that reach a certain number of users, Faireum ICO will return the transaction fee and listing fee as a reward and will further reward from the community reserve pool if the game is popular enough.\n\n100% RTP and subscription plan. Faireum ICO supports a special charge subscription mode, which can be authorized or revoked by the user at any time. Based on the subscription model, developers have a chance to build a maximal 100% RTP gambling game and pro t by charging the players periodically.\n\nCore player plan. The platform can also reward users for their high activity or good scores.\n\nNetwork service provider plan. The value-added network service providers like storage providers, and third-party service providers can also be rewarded by Faireum ICO based on the volume of contributions they have made to the network.\n\nOther plans can be introduced at a later stage by Faireum ICO as deemed necessary for intensification purposes.",

            "text": " \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you keep an occasional eye on blockchain news, then you are aware that it is much more than just a growing trend. In fact, it\u2019s become quite clear that Blockchain is here to stay, and will make an even bigger impact on the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market. Its transformation on society as a whole is becoming a real hot topic, and Blockchain\u2019s influence on the economic world is currently unparalleled. So, if you deal with Blockchain and multiple cryptocurrencies, this influential spike in the industry is more than a good reason to begin to look into visiting a few of the large Blockchain events.\n\nHere is how everyone can benefit from paying a visit to blockchain events:\n\n**1. Learn from appealing speakers**\n\nPerhaps the biggest draw for large Blockchain events is the lineup of speakers. After all, if you\u2019re going to take time out of your busy schedule to attend, you\u2019ll want to be sure that you are listening to well-educated influencers in the field, who can offer real-world advice.\n\n**2. Discover New Tokens and new technology from vendors**\n\nThe exhibitors are also a huge plus when attending a large Blockchain event, as you never know which product or a new piece of technology might be just what you\u2019re looking for to move your business to the next level. Additionally, you may find that you can collaborate with a vendor, which can be mutually beneficial for both parties. You never know where you might find a surprising new opportunity!\n\n**3. Network with others attending the event**\n\nThroughout the day, the chances are good that you\u2019re going to meet quite a few like-minded individuals. After all, that\u2019s why you\u2019re all at the same event! Take this opportunity to network away. Whether you find that you can join forces with another attendee for a project, or you just file a name and affiliation for later use, a contact is a contact, and you never know when you might need one.\n\n**4. Eventually become a guest speaker**\n\nYou may already be well-educated in the Blockchain industry, or perhaps you\u2019re just beginning to learn of its many financial benefits. Whichever the case, you may thoroughly enjoy the idea of moving into the spotlight and becoming a guest speaker. The tables may turn after some time and with immense knowledge, you could turn out to be a speaker.\n\nIf I have sparked some curiosity in you to attend a large crypto event that is happening soon, then you are lucky as there is one you should not miss for anything. The North American Bitcoin Conference, join hundreds of the most influential speakers as they deliver compact crypto masterclasses. It will take place from January 17th to 19th. Dive into conversations and discuss the state of cryptocurrency with industry pioneers and innovators.\n\nKeynote programming is focused on real-time topics and trends and offers attendees honest perspectives and strategies to impact their future with cryptocurrency. Listen as the most brilliant minds teach us about global adoption of blockchain technology, institutional investment (inc. Grayscale, MicroStrategy, ETFs, NFTs), geopolitical threats, and the newest opportunities in blockchain (inc. regulatory sandboxes, restrictions). Discuss decentralized finance (inc. DeFi, \u201cEthereum killers\u201d, yield farming), central bank digital currencies (inc. Stablecoins, Tether), and much much more.",

They all wanted you to purchase a hefty amount of tokens in order to have even the opportunity to create something. Why? Because these platforms didn't share the vision of the future, where everything and everyone has a token to call their own, true financial freedom and true free market.\n\nDo you know who believes that is the future, who envisions it as such? **CZ himself**, right out of his mouth. If he knew what this team was doing, that they were sharing this revolutionary idea which would make his vision into a reality, he would be shilling this himself. Moonpump's IDO known as  Pumplaunch, is trying to create a platform for **EVERYONE**.\n\nA very small amount of $PUMP would give you access to the platform, so that dream could actually become a reality. Anyone could afford the opportunity to create their own token. Do you know why Bitcoin became what it is? Because the function they aimed to provide, was something people who looked into the future understood, and from that stemmed belief in it. And from that belief came the financial support  that made it what it is, and made that future happen.\n\nWen lambo, wen  moon? When you believe in the future that the Moonpump developers and CZ himself believe in. **This is not a shitcoin, this is a utlility coin, this is a future coin!**  Belief drives the future for all of us as it shapes the world around us. Fear is the mind killer, do not allow it to control you and shatter  your dreams, push through it and you will find true freedom. Do not let those seeking short term gains, whales, bots, and of course fud, blind you to what we really are, what we stand for and where we are headed. **We stand for everyone, we stand for financial freedom, and we are headed for the future and for the stars.**\n\nThere  is no other time than now to prepare for it. Invest in this token, invest in these developers, invest in everyone's future. Sean was like Floyd Mayweather in every AMA and in voice chat live throughout launch, begging for people to ask questions because he could knock all of them out, because the development team believe in  themselves and their future.\n\nThey **KNOW** what they can do, they **KNOW** what they have to offer the world, and they **WILL** accomplish this goal. I believe in Moonpump, and I believe everyone else should too.\n\n**Pumplaunch is the future, JOIN US!!!**\n\n**BUY NOW ON PANCAKE SWAP!!!

            "text": "It\u2019s no more news that technological evolution is now moving in a fast pace with so much innovations ongoing globally, part of such innovations birthed projects like AI, Blockchain, and Machine Learning. Self-driving vehicles which recognizes human face and voice are now being developed to make our life more simple and meaningful. \nAlso, there is a decentralized technology ongoing in our world today\u2019s world called Blockchain network. The blockchain was able to get everyone\u2019s attention due to its astonishing functions and features like time-stamping, decentralization, and use of smart contracts. Bitcoin which was the leading generation of blockchain was ushered into existence inform of decentralization and a transaction gateway was developed so as to allow all users of it to be able to enjoy business transactions on a peer-to-peer mode by ensuring that every user are in charge of their personal information.\nWith all these superb qualities of blockchain-based project; it\u2019ll be trustworthy, reliable, and transparent. Envisage a platform where there is integration of Artificial intelligence and blockchain network to building a single ecosystem; I believe such ecosystem will be a great one. This is principle birthed AQER ecosystem.\n\nWhat is it?\nAQER is an acronym for \u201cArtificial Intelligence Quotation for Entertainment Rights\u201d which occurs to be a pioneer in Blockchain and AI marketplace whereby content authors and content enthusiast can come together; as a result of this, it\u2019ll be a successful project that integrates these two authors and their users on a single environment called AQER. \nAQER is an AI and Blockchain ecosystem that is among the leading brilliant global digital market place where content users and influencers converge for a trustworthy service. Inside of AQER environment consist of smart contracts wallets, AI algorithm, blockchain and also an exclusive token which help protect business transactions in line with Intellect Property rights.\nAQER environment consist of an acronym of Vloggers meaning \u201cVideo Bloggers\u201d such that assist content influencers to advertise their creativity on such channels. Therefore, with AQER ecosystem these Vloggers would be placed accordingly due to their channel followers, views etc. \nBenefit of AQER \n1. In an effort of making content marketplace well-organized for both parties of content authors and fans, AQER relies upon AI and blockchain, through which will be a way fetching such title of global leading online marketplace for entertainment benefits.\n\n2. There will be fairness and transparency to everyone within AQER marketplace and therefore allows easy accessibility means for Vloggers and their work.\n3. In making sure various companies gets in touch with a dependable Vlogger, AQER will leverage upon its technologies to collect information from other social media projects like Instagram, YouTube to allow companies select their desired Vloggers for their advertising services. Also, those Vloggers consequently will be \u00a0contacted through their services without intermediaries.\n4. In order to make sure terms aren\u2019t changed halfway, all agreements are legally bind between vloggers and companies and are stored on blockchain, with \u00a0unhindered nature of blockchain there will be no bit of exploitation whatsoever and transparency will be obvious\n5.Before now, due to the lack of competence way whereby content influencers and enthusiasts interconnect with one another, mediator services were required by companies; it created shortcomings for these companies, hence they were charged up to 50% fees by this means causing exploitation. AQER has brought an end mediators services because the system has been designed to handle it agreement direct though technologies market.\n6.Adequate compensation to Vloggers will be well taken care of. \u00a0There will be high partnership between Vloggers too; and many false Vloggers will be flushed out of the system to allow other trusted stay on board. \n\n\nConclusion\nBlockchain is crucial in AQER ecosystem as it make sure that it foster transparency, this is because intermediaries\u2019 rights, escrows, fees, are removed through its technology which are real qualities of blockchain network. \nAQER has a token of an ERC20 compliance built on Ethereum blockchain with a whole sum of 100,000,000 supplies. AQER token will be used as right of entry to get access to various activities within AQER platform.\nIn addition, with the help of blockchain AQER can be able to allocate entertainment tokens and rights competently. AQER assures sharing of brilliant entertainment right contracts and as well as prompt payment to those entitled to it.\nFor further information kindly click these links:\nWebsite:\u00a0https://aqer.tech/\nWhitepaper:\u00a0https://aqer.tech/media/documents/AQER_WhitePaper_PromoSale.pdf\nYellowpaper:\u00a0https://aqer.tech/media/documents/AQER_Yellow-Paper_V2.0.pdf\nTelegram:\u00a0https://t.me/joinchat/Ezj3LUsuchRNr2GDAsFsJw\nFacebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/AQERofficial\nTwitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/AQEROFFICIAL?lang=en\nLinkedIn:\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/company/aqercompany/\nBitcoinTalk (ANN):\u00a0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5067061.0\nAuthor Bitcointalk profile link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1755292;sa=summary\n\nEth address: 0xEF1c6d6AE70E48030B0a0b0D97346105e94d41f7\n",

In manycast, the block proposer sends the 1MB block to each node in the  network one by one. Since the proposer has to send all 500MB himself, if  he has an average broadband internet speed of 64Mbps, this would take  roughly 62.5 seconds. That\u2019s faster than Bitcoin\u2019s average 10 minute  inter-block time, but it still isn\u2019t nearly fast enough for a  high-performance blockchain like Harmony.\n\nAs  you can probably guess, manycast is not very practical and not widely  used for a number of reasons. More popular approaches include gossiping  and multicast trees. In gossiping schemes, as new nodes hear about the  block, they pass it on to others in the network. This offloads some of  the communication burden from the proposer to his peers and reduces the  bottleneck. In multicast schemes, the network is arranged in a branching  tree structure originating from the proposer. When each node receives  the block it passes the message down to its children until everyone has  received it.\n\nWhereas manycast\u2019s time for block propagation is linear in the number of nodes in the network or *O(n)*, gossiping and multicast approaches take time that is only logarithmic in the number of nodes in the network or *O(log(n))*.\n\n>This is a significant improvement, but we can do even better.\n\n## The origin of\u00a0IDA\n\nA proposal for a better block propagation scheme appeared in a 2018 paper titled [Rapidchain](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/460.pdf)  by Zamani, Movahedi, and Raykova \\[1\\]. Among other improvements to  sharded blockchain protocols, the authors propose a novel technique  called\u200a\u2014\u200ayou guessed it\u200a\u2014\u200aIDA, to disseminate a block amongst a network  running a BFT [consensus protocol](https://harmony.one/). The core concept behind IDA is to use erasure  coding to break up a block into encoded chunks so that it can be quickly  and securely spread throughout network.\n\nTo understand how IDA works, you first have to know a bit about [erasure coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code).  Erasure coding allows you to take a piece of data and expand it into a  larger encoded file. Even if portions of that encoded file are lost, the  original file can still be recovered. Erasure coding schemes have *rates* which  determine the amount of the encoded file that can be lost without  losing the original. These rates also dictate the amount of excess data  or overhead that must be encoded over the original file\u2019s size.\n\nIn  IDA, the proposer takes the 1MB block and expands it into an  erasure-encoded file of 1.5MB. The proposer then chops this 1.5MB file  into 500 chunks of 3kB each. Next the proposer sends one 3kB chunk to  each of the 500 nodes in the network. Finally, each node in the network  sends their 3kB chunk to everyone else. Then each node has the chunk it  received from the proposer as well as the other 499 chunks it received  from its peers. As soon as it has more than 1MB worth of 3kB chunks,  that node can decode those chunks into the original block and voila  we\u2019re done!",

Prior to founding SMART VALOR, Olga held the position of Commercial Managing Partner at prominent Silicon Valley Bitcoin startup Xapo.\n\nOlga is a prominent founding member of the Crypto Valley community, and is the producer of the Crypto + ICO Summit, the first global conference focusing on blockchain crowdfunding in Switzerland. She is also a mentor at the largest European accelerator program, Kickstart Accelerator, and regularly delivers talks at conferences and universities on the regulation of Blockchain industry, the tokenisation of assets and the disruption of the banking industry.\n\n \n\n**When was your first encounter with Blockchain technology, Olga?**\n\nThe first time I bought Bitcoin was back in 2013. It was because I came across something intriguing, something that was making no sense from the point of view of classical monetary theory.\n\nAs the government of Cyprus announced a bail-in for banks, they had to cascade the losses on their shareholders, debt holders and even large depositors. The run on the Cypriot banks pushed Bitcoin from around 50 USD to 200 USD. This case in itself was actually quite an interesting incident from a historical perspective. For the first time in our history the role and behaviour of gold \u2013 a physical asset as old as history of humanity \u2013 was replicated by something that does not really exist: some abstract computer code run on decentralised network of computers. Perplexing situation, right? Especially if you\u2019ve ventured into the history of monetary policy before. At my post-Soviet Union University this subject was my favourite, as it was a glossy new addition to our Fiscal Policy course.\n\n**What about it really caught your attention?**\n\nI didn\u2019t take Bitcoin seriously before, but this incident got me thinking. Is it really possible to create a post-national currency that would substitute gold, a universally acknowledged asset? Cyprus was just a little ripple in the ocean of capital markets. What would happen to Bitcoin\u2019s price if World War III were to break out tomorrow?\n\nLater the same year (2013) the Chinese got excited about Bitcoin and the price started to rise even further. Chinese government however understandably was not so happy about this new borderless currency which makes it so easy to circumvent the capital control. There were announcements about a clamp-down on Bitcoin. All of this was to no avail, as the price of Bitcoin just dived for a while. This was the first proof, that governments can\u2019t do much about Bitcoin. This story was replayed in September last year as the Chinese government introduced restrictions on cryptocurrencies exchanges.",

Considering far-reaching acknowledgments, including huge number of digital coins that explore gluts of infrastructures for exchanges, one would figure out that blockchain revolution is now all over and poised to achieve monumental endorsement.\n\nObviously, without mincing words,\u00a0digital forms of money are yet to gather the momentum as recorded in the innovative ledger distributed technology known as blockchain connections. Albeit ongoing joint efforts by certain coins that converged to nip the challenges in the bud are yielding tremendous results. In spite of these results many around the globe are yet to be acquainted with this new dynamism, this is where the disruptive, and fascinating Digitalbits is entrenching its value-proposition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**STIMULATING THE BLOCKCHAIN PROCESSES**\n\nThe spur/consuming enthusiasm that went before the dispatch of the pioneer computerized resource, Bitcoin, is actually dead. It appears the hypes by cryptographic forms of money and elective coins (altcoins) are not having the foreseen effect.\n\nExploiting the distributive nature and full-scale security of the blockchain network, DigitalBits is here to revive the fire. The cardinal objective of the initiative is to encourage enormous endorsement of the cryptographic forms of money by advancing significant methodologies capable of triggering and hyping up hunger and need for the cryptocurrency.\n\nTaking a cursory look at some of the crucial functionalities of the framework, shows some of the following:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**INSIGHT INTO CORE FEATURES**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1v8fek98dbs21.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=e27c773c4580af728bbbce937d4c1dd9075351bc\n\nLike I said earlier, this efficient disruptive framework is entrnching another dynamism, a front burner solution to facilitate better liquidity. The platform comes with unique features to accomplish its objective with a user-friendly platform to trigger client interest.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, DigitalBits leverages on the blockchain network. The innovation isn't just adaptable but at the same time is secure. Accordingly, constant challenges brought about by hitches in transactive exchanges may very well be outmoded, on the grounds that this exceptional framework has the ability to deal with on-chain and cross-chain exchanges.\n\n\\*Furthermore, it's interoperable with buyer/crypto devotees applications. Along these lines, it will in general position its services before the intended interest group. Digitalbits lines this up amid high liquidity for keeping crypto coins available for use even notwithstanding extent of unpredictability.\n\n\\*Interesting to note is the fact that a reward system that incentivizes token as a form of motivating forces to clients for doing a job well,has been put in place by the platform developers. The way individuals value it when their services are acknowledged and supported is a motivation behind why this reward component can go the additional mile to pull in more clients to the architecture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE PROTOCOL LAYER BLOCKCHAIN**\n\nIn view of the fact that Digitalbits leverages on the innovative blockchain network, the project has taken a drastic step to add some invaluable structures or better still features to pep up blockchain. With its operation successively administered as a protocol layer on the blockchain ecosystem, DigitalBits is poised to bring together existing blockchain-based frameworks and DApps to encourage the endorsement of cryptographic money form. Basically, this archittecture is interoperable with other blockchain-based infrastructure in realizing required liquidity.\n\nTOKEN INSIGHTS\n\nTicker: XDB\n\nToken Type: Utility\n\nInfrastructure: Separate Platform\n\nConversion Rate: 1 XDB = 0.00003\n\nCurrencies Accepted: BTC, ETH\n\nNot Participating: Syria, North Korea, Singapore, Yemen, Eritrea, Sudan, USA, Somali, China, Cayman, Libya, Congo, Iran,\n\nNation of Registration: Cayman Islands\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe emergence of cryptocurrency came with a lot of hope to create a boundless, transparent and scalable transaction, but challenges that have seen a huge loss of resources, compromised data among others have put paid to large-scale endorsement of the cryptographic form of money. Today, I and lots of trusted experts in the financial space are happy that Digitalbits is making its entry to nip this challenges in the bud and rekindle the fire that will see more attraction and liquidity for worldwide crypto endorsement, it is basically the future of blockchain.\n\nYou need to get further info?

For each region that we service, our team will ensure that our interface supports the primary language.

            "text": "A lthough  cryptocurrencies have been introduced to global markets quite recently,  they have already made a significant impact on the modern financial  world.\n\nHowever,  due to their decentralised nature, cryptocurrencies pose a specific  threat to the world economy, which is still tied to the US dollar.  Because cryptocurrencies don\u2019t belong to any centralised institution,  they could theoretically jeopardise the economic dominance of the United  States.\n\nCryptocurrencies  have been created to provide an anonymous method of making digital  transactions. While the average user may appreciate the privacy that  cryptocurrencies offer, their anonymous nature also means that they [could be utilised for](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-cryptocurrency-is-disrupting-the-global-economy-89347581aa93) money laundering, funding terrorist activities, or the illegal trade of drugs and ammunition.\n\nBecause of this, [some countries](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/bitcoin-survey/) (i.e. Algeria, Bolivia, Ecuador, Bangladesh, Nepal and Macedonia) have banned the use of cryptocurrencies within their borders.\n\nMeanwhile,  others have decided to develop more flexible regulatory policies  regarding cryptocurrencies, resolving the issue of illegitimate use with  mandatory licensing requirements.\n\nOne  of the pioneers in regulating cryptocurrencies is Japan. The country  has legally declared more than 30 digital currencies as financial  instruments, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. \u201cFinancial instrument\u201d  status means that these digital currencies can legally be [used](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-japan/japans-cryptocurrency-exchanges-to-set-up-self-regulatory-body-idUSKCN1GE037%29) for buying and selling goods, as well as investing and currency exchanging activities.\n\nThe central question, however, is what the benefits of licensing are for clients.\n\nFor more please visit [medium](https://medium.com/cindx/cindx-legal-how-cindx-is-ensuring-legal-compliance-4e075b5d34)\n\nfor much more please visit [https://cindx.io/](https://cindx.io/)",

            "text": "Before you invest in AiBB, the first thing that you have to do is to buy their AiBB tokens. The sale is already happening at the time of this report and the price of the tokens will increase as the sale happens.\n\nThe sale will happen in three phases:\n\n\u200bPhase 1: first 10% tokens;\n\nPhase 2: next 25% tokens;\n\nPhase 3: last 45% tokens (20% of the tokens will not be sold).\n\nThere are also discounts if you buy in large quantities.\n\n\u200bYou can buy tokens using Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin, but not Bitcoin Cash or Dash, for example, so if you only have these cryptocurrencies, you will have to exchange them before you actually invest in this company using your cryptocurrency. If you want, you also have the option to pay using fiat money.\n\nFor more information about AiBB, visit here:  https://aibb.io\n\n",

            "text": "\nLTO Network is a blockchain platform enabling B2B to collaborate on equal footing by using trustless processes: essentially any business process (BPM) or legal agreement can be automated via Live Contracts (extended deterministic Finite State Machines). LTO infrastructure combines miniature ad-hoc permissionless private chains and a permissionless public chain - as well as the developer toolkit to interact with them. Processes are completely GDPR and regulatory compliant and are also made easy for adoption and integration. The blockchain uses a newly developed Leased proof of Importance staking model and uses BitcoinNG consensus.\n\nEach association maintains various business forms, which can characterize the principles of a work process, pictured as a flowchart or BPMN graph. With LTO, a work process is communicated as a deterministic expanded Finite State Machine (FSM). Blockchain empowers associations to run these work processes decentralizedly, empowering each gathering to take an interest utilizing their own hubs. \n\nWebsite: https://lto.network\n\nLTO NETWORK",

            "text": "\n\nimusify is challenging the music industry by providing innovative solutions for musicians, labels, and listeners. As never seen before, imusify provides a decentralized music marketplace offering top services for artists and everyone in the recording business. The award-winning blockchain-based project has plans to disrupt the music business and beyond with a solid cryptocurrency, IMU, which will serve various functions within the ecosystem while being used as a means of payment such as Bitcoin or the euro. So what\u2019s so special about the IMU Tokens?\n\nThe decentralized music industry\nWith an easy-to-use and friendly interface, the imusify platform provides an all-in-one solution for every musician, fan, and label. With no need of any intermediary \u2014 as seen in the case of the traditional streaming platforms of files sharing providers \u2014 imusify reinvents music consumption and sharing in the blockchain era, letting artists manage their own revenues or royalty payments. Similarly, to inject new forms of revenues, fans or musicians are incentivized to take actions on the system, such as curating music content.\n\nThe smart music economy encourages both music creators and listeners to interconnect and share information of value \u2014 and creates new forms of compensation that can be way more important than solely streaming itself (for example, the traditional low pay of $0.006 to $0.0084 per stream to the holder of music rights on the streaming giant Spotify).\n\nThe scalable growth of IMU Tokens\nIMU Tokens serve various functions on the platform. When someone creates a playlist, curates music content, vote for songs, or simply listen to music, they receive IMU Tokens into their wallets. To say it short, every type of known activity linked to digital music creation and management is compensated on the platform, while royalties collection and copyrights are tracked efficiently thanks to smart contracts issuance. So anytime the song of an artist is played on a third-party \u2014 TV, film, radio \u2014 artists can receive IMU Tokens into their digital wallet as imusify enables proper royalties tracking and management.\n\nSince IMU Tokens serve multiple utilities on the platform, the Tokens are likely to be in high demand as soon as imusify reaches mass adoption. IMU can be converted to most crypto exchanges including NEO, BTC, ETH. With a limited supply of 1,000,000,000, the imusify cryptocurrency will become scarce in the future. We can further imagine that IMU Tokens will serve new functions once imusify introduces new features.\n\nimusify creates real revenues for musicians compensated in IMU\nArtists are not yet fully educated on blockchain and its huge advantageous economy. With the example of imusify, we can easily highlight what musicians can really earn on such an ecosystem. But for such a new system to succeed, two conditions are required:\n\nThe platform must provide a real-life product that serves millions of people and helps them solve real issues\nThe ecosystem must be rooted in a strong business plan with a solid cryptocurrency of high potential\nSo far, we can say that the imusify native cryptocurrency, IMU serves the two above.\n\nAs a means of payment within the ecosystem, the IMU Tokens even provide trust and transparency for artists and listeners. Furthermore, imusify users will be able to share music and receive the right rewards which have been missing until now, despite a USD 17 billion revenue growth of revenues in 2018.\n\nFor more information about imusify, please consult: https://imusify.com/ico.pdf",

            "text": "Volentix, who has been trying to establish a decentralized community, has announced an encouragement program for Vespucci. For this incentive program, 455 million units will offer VTX as a public treasure.\n\nIn recent times, the vast majority of people have begun to see the risks of the ups and downs in the world of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Volentix is \u200b\u200bdeveloping a digital asset ecosystem (DAE) where people gather all the tools they need to help this large audience enter the digital asset world more easily and securely. To support this vision, they will soon be implementing a VTX-funded incentive program, which is Volentix's digital presence.\n\n\u00a0Inspired by a scientific article published in Medium, Volentix's first aim is to educate the public on the features of the Volentix project, to support the process through incentives and to increase the number of potential participants.\n\nVolentix will provide its visitors with an official web address, [www.volentix.io](https://www.volentix.io), to VTX, the financial source of its digital asset system, if they review their information modules. The procedures to be done by the participants are; Review the contents of VDex Whitepaper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zq0k1tuwsy031.jpg?width=1630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=38fc1dccaa12515d68a541a73e3e51e2bd40e33b\n\nVolentix is \u200b\u200ban example of a decentralized platform. This platform aims to become an ecosystem of decentralized assets that will facilitate the storage, negotiation, and analysis of cryptographic assets. The exchange, Vdex, will be totally decentralized.\n\nThe digital currency first began with the presence of bitcoin and continued to be monitored by various other digital currencies. Each digital currency has some additional functions, but basically, its use is to replace the traditional financial system, which has many shortcomings in many ways.\n\nVolentix makes every effort to provide significant changes in the financial system, especially in the digital format, which is very practical to use.\n\nThese benefits continue to rely on many other digital platforms to support efforts to streamline transactions. Voletix is powered by blockchain technology, which allows the operator to be removed from the center.\n\nEvery data that is obtained and needed to support a transaction process will be stored in a block that uses an encrypted security system. This data can be accessed by anyone with specific special conditions. It supports the transparent structure so that it can maintain the trust of each user.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpw10v2dty031.jpg?width=769&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20b7ee9831a624769025d865223cc5b36688f0cb\n\nWhen each offer or sale is made, the market will verify the market to ensure and execute Volantix. This decentralized system will also be safer and will repel market manipulations that we can currently observe in the stock market.\n\nTactics such as high-frequency trade and lists of massive walls are simply artificial price movements that would be avoided. The Volantix platform also has its own multi-currency portfolio called Verto, which serves as the gateway to access Vdex. This portfolio is totally decentralized and contains the keys of the multiple portfolios it has. The password and stored locally. This means that he is able to control the Volantix platform. No one, except you, has the right to access your fortune. This right also comes with each person who has the responsibility to manage their own assets.\n\nWithin the scope of this program, Volentix will present 455,000,000 VTX units of its local digital presence as a public treasury to finance the proposals for decentralized community members and the Volentix DAO's autonomous organization (Volentix DAO). Improvements in relevant technology and improvements in management infrastructure can be shown as examples of these proposals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwebsite:\n\n[www.volentix.io](https://www.volentix.io)\n\nwhitepaper:\n\n[https://volentix.io/documentation/vdex-whitepaper/](https://volentix.io/documentation/vdex-whitepaper/)\n\nAuthor: Arif \u00c7ak\u0131r\n\nBounty0x username: arifcakir13",

It is no secret that people have already fallen in love with the bitcoin payment system based on the blockchain and understand how much it can change not only the entire financial system for the better, but also affect production and other areas.\n\nNaturally, it will take a lot of time to take root, as well as to finalize in terms of scalability and protection of this innovation, the widespread adoption of digitization of assets, data and tokenization of material values, many projects are already trying to create such platforms.\n\nBlockchain surprised many with the results of ICO which collected large amounts of investments, as it easily removes any territorial and political restrictions, people felt that at the same time the technology can combine privacy and at the same time transparency of all operations and be decentralized.\n\nIn the future, it is hard to imagine that the blockchain will be able to replace the centralized system of data used by states, but it is more likely that it will be able to carry out enterprises and other organizations for which immutability and data protection is important.\n\n\nTHE LTO NETWORK VALUE PROPOSITION\nLTO network was conceptualized out of the deep need of existing clientele. The company is not a \u2018blockchain company, however, it leverages on the blockchain technology to provide crucial answers to improve their solution. It is a private permissionless network, where everyone can set up a hub and check business dealings, yet information is just shared between members of a particular process. Looking back LTO primary focus is on the issue of adoption which they are into presently in contrasted with numerous different platforms, having earned 1.4M USD from customers this year.\n\nThe LTO Network is making its entry with a value proposition to bring a procedure that will chronicle into a computerized appropriated record that serves individual and business needs identified with legitimately binding contracts. Basically following this objective, it makes a decentralized work process component that enables you to trade data about private blockchains, while exchanges will be recorded in a mutually shared blockchain.\nThe LTO Network utilizes the agreement or consensus instrument with minimal proof of importance to accomplish agreement on their blockchain. This planned system permits smallholders of tokens who would prefer not to run a node to get rewards for tokens. It is indistinct why the LTO Network needs to make its own blockchain as opposed to utilizing the current and demonstrated base-level framework.\n\nLTO NETWORK is not the first day provides its services and began to work in 2014, now their main task is to help businesses, governments to move to the use of decentralized applications and services. Definitely this project has all chances to solve existing problems of protection and safety of data of the companies, to eliminate probability of loss of information at use of intermediaries.

            "text": "Stablecoins are backed by stable assets like fiat currency or precious metals. Hence their values don't fluctuate much. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. This means that the prices of coins can rise and plummet abruptly, which makes it difficult for investors to zero down on a particular coin. However, stablecoin solves this issue. Stablecoins are digital currencies that are backed by assets such as fiat currency, other cryptocurrencies, or gold. The stable assets make these coins less susceptible to fluctuations and keep their prices stable. Certain stablecoins also use a computer algorithm to keep their value comparatively stable.\n\nHere's how stablecoins work:\n\n1. The advantage of stablecoins is that they are built to withstand volatility in a way that other cryptocurrencies aren't. Additionally, they can offer mobility and accessibility. It is a more stable cryptocurrency that is decentralized. This implies that is not tied to a centralized system or agency. This, in turn, grants it autonomy.\n2. There are several other reasons for stablecoins being popular among investors. It allows for faster transfer of money and provides privacy of financial data. Along with this, stablecoins also allows users to circumvent financial service fees.\n3. In several ways, stablecoins may not be like other crypto investments. They are designed to stay put in terms of value. This means that while they will not be a fall in value, it will not rise either. This can be understood by comparing the USD coin to the Bitcoin. Since its inception, the USD coin has hardly fluctuated from its $1 value. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has seen a large amount of fluctuation.\n\nAccording to me, these are some of the top stable coin exchanges that you can check out: \u00b7 xSigma Finance xSigma Finance is a decentralized stablecoin exchange that provides the cheapest transactions for customers and a mining platform for liquidity providers. On one side, customers can exchange their stablecoins at the best rate; on the other side, liquidity providers offer their stablecoins to earn rewards.\n\n\u00b7 Coinbase Coinbase is another great exchange that promotes the selling and buying of both cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Coinbase was the first major crypto business to go public in the U.S. when it began trading at $381 in the very beginning on the Nasdaq, giving the cryptocurrency exchange an initial market cap of $99.6 billion on a fully diluted basis. \u00b7 Gemini Gemini is a privately-owned exchange that allows users to buy, sell, trade, and securely store bitcoin, ether, and about 40 other cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. It was launched in 2015 by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.\n\nGemini has a tiered service with separate interfaces and fee structures for casual investors and hard-core traders. It has a mobile app, a payment app, and its own currency, the Gemini dollar. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, the Gemini dollar is a \"stable coin\" tied to the U.S. dollar.\n\nHave you held and investments in stable coins ever? Or do you use it for trading purposes only?",

            "text": " \n\n**ABOUT THE PROJECT**\n\nThe Collective is a Guernsey-based Fintech company working on CDEX, a decentralized marketplace for Ethereum-based tokens and TraderOne \u2013 our centralized exchange. TraderOne will be a robust trading platform for all the different types of digital assets. Additionally, we are proud to bring you The CollectiveGO game. The CollectiveGO Will be an augmented reality experience powered by our native token, and monetized through various digital currency advertisers.\n\nThe COLLECTIVE consists of five major groups which will be explained by me shortly, this network is a Guernsey-based fintech company that encompasses of different working products. There are five existing products on the\u00a0collective\u00a0network namely: the collective community company, the tradeone centralized exchange, the decentralized exchange, collectivego video game, and the collective global initiative.\n\nThe above mentioned will all be driven by the COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT EXCHANGE TOKEN CDEX. It will serve as the driving force of the\u00a0collective\u00a0in which the entire network will function with. The use of CDEX tokens has lots of benefits and use cases for users of the platform.\n\nThe Collective provides its clients with a variety of services including, but not limited to, existing social media account management, social media content creation, telegram moderation, coordination of 3rd party vendors for services, and general blockchain consultation services. The social media platforms that The Collective may engage on include, but are not limited to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Medium, Reddit, Telegram, and Youtube.\n\n**FEATURES OF THE PLATFORM**\n\n**INCUBATION:**\n\nAll you need is an idea, a team to deliver, and the drive to manifest your vision.. We can complete full incubation of your ICO/STO and make your idea a reality. Having your ICO/STO incubated with The Collective puts you in front of thousands of ready and eager financial contributors.\n\n**COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT:**\n\nThe Collective refer to themselves as Social Influencers. The Collective has thousands of hours of community development experience, from managing Social Medias for viral growth \u2013 to developing fan art and engagement hack\n\n**COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT**:\n\nThe Collective provide their clients with guidance on strategy, partnerships, influencers, and other factors vital to realize a successful community driven blockchain project.\n\n## BENEFITS OF THE PLATFORM\n\nHigh-level security.  \nStable coin pair.  \nBasic trading options.  \nAdvanced API (Application Programming Interface).  \nHigh-tech infrastructure.\n\nCollectiveGO and plans for a collective global initiative. The collective global initiative includes all of our core values, providing creative ways to unify the economy of concerts, develop common best practices for the entire industry and protect our communities, providing reliable outlets for everyone in a crypto-space.\n\n**Types of Crypto Exchanges:**  \nThere are two main types of crypto exchange. Collective ecosystem has both types and this is its great advantage and makes it competitive.  \nUsers will be able to choose which look they prefer. Each of them is fundamentally different in its essence, and depending on your preferences you will find advantages with each type.\n\n**Decentralized option:**  \nDecentralized trade is a market that does not rely upon an outsider administration for putting away client reserves. Exchanges happen just between clients (shared) through a self-loader process. Crafted by such trades is in every case entirely steady and it pulls in numerous brokers. Keep up an abnormal state of security because of the absence of a focal server and guarantee obscurity and low commissions.\n\n**Unique Security Advantages:**  \nFollowing a rush of phishing, malware and digital assaults on noticeable trades, security is the principal thing on each broker personality and which is all well and good. Decentralized trades innately incorporate elevated security. Gigantic security assaults, for example, the generally $470 million that was stolen from Mt. Gox, were conceivable on the grounds that the unified hot wallets of the trade were focused on, which displayed a solitary purpose of disappointment. In a decentralized trade, every client is in private control of their own assets, so there is no main issue of assault.\n\n**Centralized option:**  \nCentralized currency exchanges are the most common type of exchange, allowing users to buy, sell and trade bitcoins and other popular altcoins. Traders can keep their cryptocurrency on these exchanges. Centralized exchanges differ from other types of intermediaries in that buyers and sellers must deposit their paper money or crypto assets before trading and register an account.\n\n**Basic and advanced trading options:**  \nWe implement the \u201cone-click purchase\u201d option through a simple user interface. This feature is intended for novice traders, and also includes \u201ccopy trading\u201d and social interactions.  \nOur advanced trading tools and a very simple user interface will allow advanced traders to use all the standard technical analysis indicators with a quick click rate.\n\n \n\n[https://www.thecollectivegroup.org/ico/](https://www.thecollectivegroup.org/ico/)\n\n[https://www.thecollectivegroup.org/ico/WP\\_Collective.pdf](https://www.thecollectivegroup.org/ico/WP_Collective.pdf)\n\nBounty0x ID: chemist32",

Over 100s of millions of dollar lost in exchange which cannot be retrieved. Many investors were severely burnt by these hacks and will not return to crypto market.

Inzura protects the crypto asset and brings trust in the crypto community that not even single user will face loss of crypto in this crypto space anymore. Over 100s of millions of dollar lost in exchange which cannot be retrieved. \u00a0Inzura solves this problem and attracts new investors to enter the market. Inzura is an ERC20 token which serves as an insurance token for your crypto asset. Inzura takes the crypto space to next level the way people see cryptocurrency. Inzura provides protection to your crypto asset by insuring your crypto asset like never before. Inzura is the world first token which serves as crypto insurance where you can claim the lost/hacked/scammed cryptocurrency.\n\nCrypto market have gone through lots and lots of hacks and scam over the past years. There are few hacks that have shook the crypto market down to its very core. Even the top most exchange that handled 70% of the world\u2019s bitcoin exchanges have faced most unexpected hack. Yet the hack did not stop there, about 120,000 BTC which was worth $72 million was stolen in August 2016. The hack continued all over the world from small volume exchanges to huge volume exchanges. South Korea have faced $30 million worth of hack in cryptocurrency in 2018. Exchange in India was hacked and over 440 BTC was hacked back in early 2018. Users will not get back their lost cryptocurrency. To give solutions to all these problems, INZURA is developed and tested with the best in class protocol for insurance specially designed with cryptocurrency in mind. Inzura is the next revolutionary project in the crypto space. Inzura is an insurance token that allows users to claim their loss of cryptocurrency.\n\n \n\n**UTILITY AND USABILITY**\n\nIZA token is only used to buy premium for crypto insurance. Buying premium can cover the crypto from any loss such as hack/scam/lost crypto asset for ever in an exchange. Token mechanism best explains the circulation process of IZA token in the market so that it has real time use case and demand that increases day by day. It shows how it flow through users and it\u2019s usability. The following is the token mechanism of INZURA.\n\n \n\n**RICE STABILITY**\n\nThe price value of IZA token is similar to stable coin. The price value is directly dependent on FAP value in the INZURA platform. FAP protocol is implemented to make sure that price is stable and cannot pump or dump as seen in other coins/tokens when listing in an exchange. FAP is the base for IZA price value.\n\n**FUTURE DEMAND**\n\nThe demand for crypto insurance is so huge that it will drastically pull new investors and institutional investors which in turn directly reflects the crypto capitalization to pump high and bring the bull market. \n\nUsers had bad experience in crypto space in the past since there has been many hacks and scams which took away user\u2019s hard earned money, leaving bad impression on crypto. This in turn makes the crypto users to lack confident and trust. Bringing trust in each crypto user can trigger the bull run.\n\nTrust is one of the key features in crypto space to take crypto next level. Without trust, bringing bull run is less likely to happen. Mass adoption only takes place when people trust the market.\n\nMass adoption and institutional investor comes in when they have confident that they will not lose the crypto.\n\nINZURA platform offers crypto insurance through premium towards the asset in crypto exchanges so that user can claim their loss and retrieve their coin in their native crypto. Since the total supple of INZURA is fixed and is only 120 million IZA tokens, it will create huge demand before even user starts realizing how important INZURA is. The circulating supply will hardly be around 100 million which is enough to make huge demand in the market. Since the FAP protocol is implemented, huge pumps and dumps can be avoided even though there is huge demand and mass adoption. Since the base price of FAP is $1, the IZA price can reach to its max of $5 because the claim coverage is directly based 5 times the FAP price.\n\n \n\n**PRICE PREDICTION**\n\nIZA token price prediction is made simple. Claim value is directly based on FAP price. FAP is directly based total value of premium covered in the exchanges. For instance; if 100,000,000 is the circulating supply of IZA token and the claim leverage is 5 times the FAP value, premium can cover insurance value of about $500,000,000 worth of cryptocurrencies. When demand goes high, there will be very less token that will be circulating. If INZURA covers total $10,000,000,000 worth of premium with circulating supply of 100,000,000 IZA token, the FAP price can be predicted around $20 to cover 10 billion dollar worth of premium. This makes the price value of IZA token independent of Bitcoin price and does not follow the price trend irrespective of its pump or dump.\n\nWebsite: [https://www.inzura.world/](https://www.inzura.world/)\n\nWhitepaper: [https://www.inzura.world/static/media/Inzura%20Whitepaper%20v1.2.1.93dfbde0.pdf](https://www.inzura.world/static/media/Inzura%20Whitepaper%20v1.2.1.93dfbde0.pdf)\n\nBounty0x ID: ecamli",

Token participation represents non-dilatable participation in a project. In contrary to shares in a company, the number of which can be increased in a capital raise, the number of tokens in existence cannot be increased. In principle, it is similar to Bitcoin in regards to limited supply of token, which are however in difference to Bitcoin all pre-mined. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.

On the contrary, crypto entities continue to spread rapidly to the floor. In addition, despite this bad situation, both existing projects and new projects continue to explain themselves to people and develop themselves. Thousands of projects, which started in 2009 with bitcoin, are trying to improve themselves in some way. However, some developments are different from before, of course. In the early days, we were surprised when the ethereuma came across with a comprehensive platform. It was a platform that contained a crypto world in itself, ethereum. Then the idea of some kind of blockchain continued to emerge. Projects that usually serve in one or two areas have become a bit more comprehensive nowadays.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou may have difficulty understanding what I said above at first sight. But there is a familiar name that is trying to do what I call the future in the past. At first, we only knew about Binance as the Krypto money exchange. Binance is still an ambitious project in this field. But that's not enough, launch the ICO with Launchpad. And then DeX comes up, allowing labs to develop itself and keep improving day by day. It is no longer a simple stock market, but a complete ecosystem.\n\nthe visual result of volentiix was one of the projects at Blockchain Economy Summit on February 20 in Istanbul!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm going to tell you about a project that works to do the same thing today. Volentix is literally a crypto entity \u201cecosystem\u201d. In general, the word platform that complements the content of such projects, it makes sense to use the ecosystem in Volentix (which is the definition of themselves). Verto, venue, Vespucci, VDex, Valoro the platforms included in this ecosystem VTX represent the monetary value of this platform.\n\nviolent-related visual result\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to explain some of the contents of the names mentioned above one by one;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VDEX**\n\nToday, when the money is called crypto, one of the first things that comes to mind is a decentralized structure. However, this structure cannot find its place on the Krypto money exchanges. Volentix will be one of the cornerstones of its ecosystem, DeX puts its non-central stock market. Vdex is a reliable, fast, user-friendly, user-friendly stock market that is willing to be one of the most important elements of the ecosystem. Moreover, the stock market will not only accommodate certain parities but also many crypto assets with multi-assest support. All this is done by [EOS.IO](https://EOS.IO) will use its network and its smart contracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VERTO**\n\nVerto is the multi-crypto asset support of this ecosystem. This wallet app provides user support to the fullest, peer-to-peer transfers to support wallet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VESPUCCI**\n\nThe name of the Volentix family, which we're talking about as an ecosystem, is Vespucci. With Vespucci, objective evaluation of all data in real time and from past to present will be provided.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VENUE**\n\nVenue is a platform designed to keep this ecosystem alive and to support community support for VTX, which will represent this ecosystem financially. The venue community is designed as a platform to provide updates and some awards for VTX. It is not my custom, but if you want to use my reference, you can subscribe to the venue and follow the development of VTX as well as earn some prizes. To do this, just click on the top heading in the title with venue written title.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom the beginning, you can see that this platform, which is prepared to implement the non-central crypto asset ecosystem, is very ambitious in every sense. Social media uses, platform preparations, advertisements, and a transparent ecosystem Volentix that can offer a decentralized working area in every field with its team. In their own words, they aim to establish an independent structure dedicated to the development of the digital asset ecosystem, respecting local legal regulations. In order to do this, VTX coin, which will keep this network alive, will represent its economy, was put on sale. Moreover, like many projects that we are familiar with, the logic of the caravan is not guided on the road. Since I have been following the project for a while, I know clearly that the hard working team is preparing the platform for the post-ICO implementation. The Verto Wallet app is ready for both PC (Windows\u2013Mac) and mobile devices (Android). With continuous updates on other platforms, they keep the Volentix community up to date.\n\n \n\nLinks:\n\nWebsite: [https://volentix.io/](https://volentix.io/)\n\nWhitepaper: [https://volentix.io/documentation/vdex-whitepaper/](https://volentix.io/documentation/vdex-whitepaper/)\n\nYoutube: [https://youtu.be/eFogX3gunyM](https://youtu.be/eFogX3gunyM)\n\n**bounty0x username: germandivision**",

Having served as field Engineer for Fujitsu, Technology Specialist within the Seattle USA public school system and Principal for the Resonant Marketing Group, Robert has always had his eye on creating a peer-to-peer platform where content creators get paid regardless of how their content is distributed.\n\nThis led him to come up with the peer-to-peer concept of profit-based file sharing which he called AVXIP and has metamorphosed into AVXChange.  \n Robert is also an avid fan of independently produced films.\n\n\u00b7 **Ryan Strasser** \u2014 COO\n\nAfter being a technician at Suburban Hospital in Maryland, Ryan moved to the Philippines in 2012, and he was the marketing head of a bitcoin marketing company.\n\nBeing the true entrepreneur that he is, Ryan started consulting in various capacities for different companies within the Asian region (China and Singapore mainly).\n\nHe gained an increased interest in everything crypto and blockchain in 2015 and even consulted on major projects then as well.\n\nHe brings his extraordinary expertise in business and blockchain technology to the team.\n\n\u00b7 **Mark Dave Manansala** \u2014 CTO\n\nBeing a passionate guy and firm believer in both technology in general and blockchain technology in particular, Mark Dave began his career as a freelancer developing mobile and web applications while he was in college.\n\nHaving worked at a previous crypto-trading organization (Snipers Tube) as the operations manager, Mark Dave believes that crypto technology is one of those disruptive technologies which will change the World forever.\n\nMark also holds a degree in Computer Science from Notre Dame of Dadiangas University.\n\n**Final Thought**\n\nDecentralized media distribution for profit is the key to making sure that content developers get to enjoy their craft and also to create a standard for the Media and Entertainment industry for everyone else to follow. The use of blockchain technology to create a reward system will also ensure that the industry doesn\u2019t fall on hard times.\n\nAVXChange as a project is the perfect opportunity to say goodbye to the days of guys who wanted only to beat the system and not help it grow for the advancement of humanity (Like DVD-Jon).",

In the future you will be able to trade here with many other currencies including the chkb\n\nWhat is the CCX ERC20 token?\n\nThe ERC20 CCX token is a cryptocurrency built on the decentralized Ethereum block. The Maximum number of tokens set 100 000 000 chkb subject to reduction of the offer. It is a proven and fully adaptable technology and open source that provides secure, simple and fast transmission. We are also prepared for an emergency, in case of failure of the main network, we will provide an opportunity to update the token software.\n\nHow many CCX tokens should I buy?\n\nA larger number of tokens is an opportunity to receive more attractive bonuses, and an opportunity to use a wider range of services with more favorable discounts and lower fees. However, everyone has to decide how many chkb tokens he should buy.\n\nWhat happens to unsold tokens?\n\nBecause of the very attractive price business concept and we firmly believe that everything will be sold. However, in the case of an unsold planned amount of CSA tokens, the remaining tokens will be destroyed algorithmically. There is no technical possibility to increase or produce any one token in circulation again. According to the article, the company can store only 20% of tokens.\n\nHow can I use CCX tokens?\n\nPro Tokens, depending on the number of devices you own, give you the opportunity to receive lower fees for transactions on the CoinCasso exchange platform and receive a large Commission for joining. You can become a part of our authority and influence on the development of the project. In addition, it gives you the opportunity to purchase membership packages that give you the opportunity to take advantage of the CoinCasso product group.\n\nWhere and when will I be able to trade tokens CCX?\n\nInitial trading will be possible on this sales platform and after the sale event it will be presented to our exchange CoinCasso within 30 days.\n\nWhat is the probability of a successful coincasso exchange token project \\[CCX\\]?\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is a young, fast-growing infrastructure characterized by high exchange rate fluctuations. Given the complexity of the CoinCasso token exchange project and the very attractive benefits of participating in it, we can safely assume that this project will quickly become popular. Currently, innovative solutions that solve the problems of average users are counting on the cryptocurrency market. CoinCasso token exchange allows the average user to leave the speculator area and, in some cases, take advantage of the passive advantages that have so far been possible only for large businesses. This is an innovative solution that will ensure the success of this project. CoinCasso is not just another exchange carotovorum, this is a game changer.\n\nWhat will be the speculative value of the chkb token within 2 years?\n\nFor these assumptions, it is worth taking into account several important factors, such as: low initial token sale price, project assumptions and the possibility of reducing the number of chkb tokens in the case of selling the estimated amount. We must understand that the price of the CCX token will also depend heavily on the daily turnover of the entire CoinCasso infrastructure. Taking into account the above-mentioned factors, as well as historical data, it can be assumed that the price of the chkb in the next 2 years can bring several tens or even several hundred percent of the profits from the tokens themselves as speculative units.\n\nHow can I buy CCX tokens?\n\nCurrently, the CoinCasso exchange tokens \\[CCX\\] can be purchased through the official website of matches and events. You can pay via cryptocurrency CoinPayments cryptocurrency such as: \\[BTS\\], \\[NTC\\], \\[VSN\\], \\[Et\\], \\[D\\], \\[dash\\], \\[\"DGB\"\\], \\[LSK\\], \\[waves\\], \\[currency code XMR\\], \\[boss\\], \\[Zen\\]. Additionally via PerfectMoney in USD\n\nWhen to sell bitcoin?\n\nERC20, including Pro tokens, can be stored on all platforms and payment processors that support them. However, we recommend that you keep Pro tokens as well as other cryptocurrencies always in places and wallets in which you have full control over private keys and with the ability to create a backup. It is worth considering MetaMask (Google Chrome app) or ImToken (mobile app). You should always backup your wallets, and if you store more resources, diversify their storage. The CCX token is also compatible with devices such as Ledger Nano S\n\nWebsite: https://coincasso.io/\n\nWhitepaper: https://coincasso.io/ENGLISH\\_CoinCasso\\_official\\_PLV1.pdf\n\nBounty0x ID: ecamli",

We\u2019ll use Ethereum smart contracts as the example throughout this whitepaper, but Link is main-chain agnostic and is architected in a\u00a0manner that is adaptable to\u00a0the leading smart contract supporting main-chains without a\u00a0native Web API layer.   \nLink solves some of the most persistent and pervasive problems plaguing the blockchain community: ease-of-use and accessibility. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have grown in the public consciousness, blockchain still primarily functions as a\u00a0vehicle for cryptocurrency trading and other financial applications.  \nAt Blockmason, we are true blockchain believers\u00a0\u2014 it is only a\u00a0matter of time until blockchain spurs the healthcare revolution, empowers economic freedom in developing countries, and stabilizes our fragile mass payment systems. However, it is impossible to\u00a0realize this beautiful crypto-future until the completion of essential components of blockchain infrastructure.   \nBlockchain has a\u00a0high barrier to\u00a0entry. From a\u00a0development perspective, it requires learning Solidity, cryptography APIs, and the nuances of esoteric decentralized systems. From a\u00a0user perspective, the hesitation is even simpler: decentralized applications are too damn tough to\u00a0use! In a\u00a0world that increasingly values convenience, it\u2019s difficult to\u00a0convince people to\u00a0increase their DApp usage when usage necessitates so many prerequisites, including creating and learning to\u00a0use an\u00a0Ethereum wallet, MetaMask, safely storing your private keys, and so on. Just try explaining to\u00a0someone the long-term benefits of decentralized contracts when even those in charge of regulating new technologies have no idea how they work. All the public thinks is: why use a\u00a0\u201csmart contract,\u201d when dumb contracts work just fine? Why use Lndr, when I could use Venmo? \n\n Which brings us to\u00a0one of Blockmason\u2019s core beliefs: for an\u00a0emerging technology to\u00a0succeed, it must value the user. For too long, the blockchain community has ignored functionality, in favor of niche technical development, finance, or profit\u00a0\u2014 hindering mass adoption. This is not to\u00a0say we don\u2019t love nerdy, precise technical advancement (we do!), but rather that we believe a\u00a0smooth, exciting user experience is a\u00a0necessary part of technological growth.   \nFully realizing the potential of blockchain technology requires the mass adoption of blockchain technology. Mass adoption requires an\u00a0enhanced user experience, which itself requires technological innovation. Conversely, any technical breakthrough, regardless of its importance, is squandered if it does not solve the user experience. Greater access to\u00a0technology leads to\u00a0greater technological advancement. Just think of us as blockchain\u2019s \u201cTyphoid Mary.\u201d",

            "text": " \n\nHello friends, in today's article we will  introduce a multi-wallet. Think of a wallet, with lots of coins and  tokens, so you can buy with a credit or debit card and exchange coins at  the same time. What else can one expect from a wallet ...\n\nIn  fact, if ETH had been integrated with the DAPs running on the Tron  platform, it wouldn't be eaten anyway, so let's just say it's nice. And  we have good news for you.\n\n**Atomic Wallet Exchange System**\n\nThe  Atomic Wallet is a very hard-working team with a recent update that  allows the exchange of crypto money directly from its wallet. Atomic  Wallet, which uses cryptocurrency exchange systems such as Changelly,  ShapeShift, ChangeNow, is programmed to use the other system if one  system is interrupted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis wallet  gives us a minimum of 50 AWC tokens as part of the airdrop. We will talk  about that with a little patience. The wallet's name is **ATOMIC WALLET**. Let's break down the atoms a little bit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/onjl5ujws9631.png?width=1701&format=png&auto=webp&s=63eacde6fef1b4bcd2aca667d8bf3b22289c57f9)\n\n**And now LiteCoin LTC on Atomic Wallet**\n\nWhat is Litecoin\u00a0wallet?\n\nYou  need to use a program to manage your Litecoins, it will keep your  private keys and provide additional functions such as sending,  receiving, exchanging, and more. With these programs, you\u2019re able to  manage and control your funds.\n\n**Signs of a good Litecoin Wallet**\n\n**1. Security.**  Wallet security means the way your Litecoins and other cryptos are  protected from frauds and hacking, how you manage private keys and what  security technologies a particular wallet supports.\n\n**2. Accessibility.**  This feature implies simplicity in use and the ability to withdraw your  funds from the wallet. A friendly user interface is a vital point for  new users. When choosing a [litecoin wallet](https://atomicwallet.io/litecoin), pay attention to its interface and the amounts you are able to operate with.\n\n**3. Functionality.**  If you want to choose a good LTC wallet, check it for additional  services support, such as an ability to exchange cryptocurrency or [buy crypto with a bank-card](https://atomicwallet.io/buy-bitcoin)/paypal,  etc.) In some wallets, like Atomic or Exodus, it\u2019s possible to exchange  Litecoin right in the application without visiting third party  websites. Cryptocurrency will be transferred directly on your address  after the exchange.\n\n**4. Customer Support**.  This is a vitally important to receive a fast reply on users concerns  and help with troubleshooting. Good customer care is a sign of a good  product. How fast will the support team help you, if you have any  trouble? The Crypto market is too volatile to wait days/weeks till  someone will the issue. It is a good practice to reply within 24 hours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Buy Litecoin with Credit\u00a0Card](https://preview.redd.it/l627fxkys9631.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de1529a7e00407ced79b91555817264e9b1a7188)\n\nThere  are many ways to buy Litecoin (exchanges, hot wallets), but one of the  most secure ways to buy LTC is to use Atomic Wallet. With Atomic, you  can easily purchase LTC, [BTC](https://atomicwallet.io/buy-bitcoin), [ETH](https://atomicwallet.io/buy-ethereum), [XRP](https://atomicwallet.io/buy-ripple),  BCH and hold 300+ coins and tokens in one place where only you control  your funds.

Platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum (the best cryptos on the market) have difficulty adapting to the exponential increase in new users. Scalability, speed, and security have become the main points that must be overcome by Bitcoin and Ethereum to continue to develop their platform. However, new coins and tokens appear every day, and each wants to provide different services beyond the first coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and they want to take Blockchain technology a step further. New ones are added to the new exchange to increase transaction volume for the development and support of these subcoins. One of them is the Catex exchange.\n\nCatex is ready to take place among the crypto foreign exchange market because there are no competitive trading and deposit fees. Catex has proven itself to be a safe stock exchange that is used because of the appropriate security measures applied to the system and at the company level.\n\nWhat makes\u00a0Catex.io\u00a0special? Why do we have to become members of the Catex exchange and move our investment here? Let\u2019s look at the priorities.\n\n**Catex feature**\n\n1. Safe Trading\n2. Dividends (Revenue Sharing)\n3. Mining Bonuses\n4. Believing in the Power of Unity\n5. Low Transaction Fees\n\nThe Catex stock market has its own markers like other large stock exchanges. This ERC20 based marker gives you many advantages. Let us briefly discuss what this is. But I want to share some details about the previous marker. Token symbol is CATT, which stands for Cat Token. 10 billion CATTs were launched. Previously 5 billion 3 times in a total of 8 billion were burned. The current amount is 2 billion CATT. In addition, the stock market often reduces the amount of oscillation. In this way, the indicator price will go up over time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [https://www.catex.io/](https://www.catex.io/)",

            "text": "Staking-based Sharding\nValidator Registration\nSybil attack prevention is a key security consideration in public blockchains. Bitcoin and Ethereum require the miners to compute a cryptographic puzzle (PoW) before they can propose a block. Similarly, sharding-based blockchains like Zilliqa or Quarkchain also use PoW to prevent Sybil attacks. Harmony adopts a different approach with proof-of-stake (PoS) as the validator registration or Sybil attack prevention mechanism. In order to become a Harmony validator, prospective participants (or stakers) have to stake a certain amount of tokens to be eligible. The number of tokens staked will determine the number of voting shares assigned to the validator. Each voting share corresponds to one vote in the BFT consensus.\nA voting share is a virtual ticket that allows a validator to cast one vote in the consensus. Validators can acquire voting shares by staking tokens. The amount of tokens required for a voting share is algorithmically adjusted. At the beginning of each epoch, new validators\u2019 voting shares will be randomly assigned to shards. The new validators join the shard(s) where their voting shares get assigned. As discussed in \u00a72, the consensus in a shard is reached by validators who collectively possess at least 2 f + 1 voting shares to sign the block.\nTo guarantee the security of a single shard, the amount of voting shares by malicious validators needs to be kept below 31 of all the voting shares in that shard. This is required due to the nature of BFT consensus. Harmony\u2019s adaptive thresholded PoS guarantees the above security requirement by adaptively adjusting the price of a voting share and assigning individual voting shares to shards rather than individual validators.\n\nFor more information:\u00a0https://harmony.one/",

            "text": "Hello friends, in today's article we will introduce a multi-wallet. Think of a wallet, with lots of coins and tokens, so you can buy with a credit or debit card and exchange coins at the same time. What else can one expect from a wallet ...\n\nIn fact, if ETH had been integrated with the DAPs running on the Tron platform, it wouldn't be eaten anyway, so let's just say it's nice. And we have good news for you.\n\nThis wallet gives us a minimum of 50 AWC tokens as part of the airdrop. We will talk about that with a little patience. The wallet's name is **ATOMIC WALLET**. Let's break down the atoms a little bit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Atomic Wallet Exchange System**\n\nThe Atomic Wallet is a very hard-working team with a recent update that allows the exchange of crypto money directly from its wallet. Atomic Wallet, which uses cryptocurrency exchange systems such as Changelly, ShapeShift, ChangeNow, is programmed to use the other system if one system is interrupted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nl46i0o3ck531.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a4b46fdff58d52bf42041f9a0ddfa855fe0ad67\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**And now LiteCoin LTC on Atomic Wallet**\n\n## What is Litecoin\u00a0wallet?\n\nYou need to use a program to manage your Litecoins, it will keep your private keys and provide additional functions such as sending, receiving, exchanging, and more. With these programs, you\u2019re able to manage and control your funds.\n\n**Signs of a good Litecoin Wallet**\n\n**1. Security.** Wallet security means the way your Litecoins and other cryptos are protected from frauds and hacking, how you manage private keys and what security technologies a particular wallet supports.\n\n**2. Accessibility.** This feature implies simplicity in use and the ability to withdraw your funds from the wallet. A friendly user interface is a vital point for new users. When choosing a [litecoin wallet](https://atomicwallet.io/litecoin), pay attention to its interface and the amounts you are able to operate with.\n\n**3. Functionality.** If you want to choose a good LTC wallet, check it for additional services support, such as an ability to exchange cryptocurrency or [buy crypto with a bank-card](https://atomicwallet.io/buy-bitcoin)/paypal, etc.) In some wallets, like Atomic or Exodus, it\u2019s possible to exchange Litecoin right in the application without visiting third party websites. Cryptocurrency will be transferred directly on your address after the exchange.\n\n**4. Customer Support**. This is a vitally important to receive a fast reply on users concerns and help with troubleshooting. Good customer care is a sign of a good product. How fast will the support team help you, if you have any trouble? The Crypto market is too volatile to wait days/weeks till someone will the issue. It is a good practice to reply within 24 hours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rsggect6ck531.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf482f4dc89c83309116643822e370ff5ed0a7be\n\n## Buy Litecoin with Credit\u00a0Card\n\nThere are many ways to buy Litecoin (exchanges, hot wallets), but one of the most secure ways to buy LTC is to use Atomic Wallet.

It\u2019s quite easy to use and doesn\u2019t require specific tech skills.\n\nBuy Litecoin in a secure\u00a0way\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/khmx75v8ck531.png?width=1701&format=png&auto=webp&s=785ae44a50665091292dd2ad6879244c354acc5a\n\n## Install Atomic\u00a0Wallet\n\n[Download the app](https://atomicwallet.io/buy-litecoin#download).

Alongside this is Faireum\u2019s consensus algorithm which is adopted from the Byzantine fault tolerance-based delegated proof-of-stake (BFT-DPos). An attack on the consensus is virtually impractical and impossible, as proven by Faireum\u2019s role models.\n\nFurthermore, the Faireum Virtual Machine (FVM) allows users and investors alike to create smart contracts that are interconnected with a wide array of blockchain-based coins, as well as freely exchange assets at any time, in any place.\n\n Fairness at its purest \u2013 the Zero Random Algorithm\n\nObviously, random number generators (RNGs) are essential for games of chance. However, the problem is that there are no standard methods of creating an RNG that is closest to being truly random. This results in a **flawed game logic** that centralized online betting platforms implement. No one knows how these programs work and people are losing money without them knowing.\n\nThe Zero Random Algorithm is Faireum\u2019s answer to these questionable RNGs being implemented in gambling platforms. By having a blockchain-based internal RNG that is validated by Zero-Knowledge proof, each random number generated from the blockchain is verified to be truly random, or **provably fair**.\n\n Build your world, a faireum-powered world\n\nOutside Faireum\u2019s very own official platform, everyone else can get their hands on Faireum\u2019s innovation. With Faireum\u2019s application program interface (API) and software development kit (SDK), game developers and platform proprietors can also easily adapt and integrate Faireum into their games and systems and tailor them according to their preference.\n\nFaireum sees a service-based **value-for-value** blockchain ecosystem. This eliminates the chance-altering systems of gambling platforms that exist solely for profit. In this way, players get what players give**, A fair chance for everyone**.\n\nA winter-proof crypto economy\n\nWith Institutional Investors such as University endowments like Harvard and MIT now investing in cryptocurrency funds, a more transformed business model awaits the crypto-economy wherein various economies of countless fields merge into one stronghold that is insusceptible to mere crypto climate conditions alone. Faireum brings this transformation to the investors\u2014a soil to plant their seeds on\u2014to show them that their seeds aren\u2019t dead, after all.",

Gen-X is the pre-Bitcoin generation \u2013 the demographic that cast aspersions on the coin\u2019s features.\nBoth generations, realizing the huge potentials, are keen on the extension of crypto services. This new surge of interest had a hand in the launch of 202 Financial Technology (FinTech) Security Token Offerings (STOs).\nOn its part, KABN is making use of the web-based banking service (NEO Bank) to drive more adoptions. In addition, crypto users can now spend digital assets at designated centers. These and identity validation are the benefits we tend to drive when using the platform.\n\n\n\nThe Global Identification Service\nMost startups that work towards meeting up with the GDPR guideline often take the wrong step. After Security Token Offerings (STOs), these new enterprises proceed to distribute tokens to investors. At the same time, they collate and store clients\u2019 personal data. The storage process is fragmented, because the concentration on PCs and related devices may be prone to hacks or loss of vital information because of malware/virus attack.\n\nThus, KABN changes the trend with the integration of a global identification (KABN ID), which is a medium of collecting users\u2019 data and storing the same in an encrypted database. The data, in this case, will be free of malicious access because it works on the premise of Personally-Identifying Information (PII) \u2013 users will confirm their identity before getting access to the data. This identity (ID) verification and validation is GDPR-compliant and is available in over 180 countries.\n\nThis friction-free global identification (Global ID) system uses the identity validation and verification compliance solution (Always On) to verify the identity of users.\n\nThe Crypto-Linked Card\nIt is quite hard to spend crypto coins on physical goods and services. This has been the major downside to digital assets. It also reduces its stake at getting more adoptions. The current means of accessing crypto funds is loading the assets to debit cards using third-party platforms, such as Cryptopay and BitPay.\n\nwebsite : https://www.kabntoken.com/\n\nwhitepaper : https://www.kabntoken.com/whitepaper.V1.2.pdf\n\nBounty0x username : azisjesika",

CHIMPION merchandise was built with exceptional user interface, unconventional data for users and merchants to eradicate the traditional use of FIAT (government issued currency) which can be cumbersome to carry around if it's in a large amount with an easily accessible digital asset (cryptocurrency). CHIMPION envisions to be the first cryptocurrency mainly used as a payment gateway in by the world at large. CHIMPION network consists of the merchants, individual users, reseller network, peer to peer transactions, peer to merchant transactions, and merchants to foundation transactions.\r\n\r\n\u2605 MERCHANTS: Enterprises who takes BNANA or any other digital asset of their choice in exchange of their service rendered are knowns as \u2018merchants'. CHIMPION network offers a network where merchants can register with ease, where they can carry out their sales operations and also keep the record of their important sales data. However, merchants that prefer to use BNANA exclusively as a payment gateway (those who do not cash out) are termed as \u2018standard merchants' and those who want to cash out must go through AML (anti-money laundering) process and are termed as \u2018approved merchants'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2605 INDIVIDUAL USERS: Users will be allowed to sign up and log in to their accounts in a well-designed fast on-boarding process with an easy to use interface for both newbies and masters of the crypto space. After a user downloads the mobile application from the App store or use the official CHIMPION WEBSITE and completes the sign up process with their phone number can use the network!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2605 P2M (PEER TO MERCHANT TRANSACTIONS): Customers dealings with merchants are executed with a distinctive transaction code whenever a customer purchases any merchandise from a merchant. The code holds details of the merchandise procured (price of goods and type of goods) and its seen as a QR code on the merchant\u2019s screen. After the merchant scans the QR code in the customer\u2019s application payment is initiated that is the customer debited and the merchant credited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2605 M2F (MERCHANTS TO FOUNDATION TRANSACTIONS): Approved merchants can swap CHIMPION with FIAT effortlessly. Merchants can use their BNANA tokens to acquire merchandise for themselves or they can choose to join the approved merchant network and cash out from CHIMPION foundation.\r\nBCD PAY WALLET\r\nBCD PAY WALLET is integrated with#chimpion network, it is a mobile wallet that can be downloaded from google play store with a friendly and an easy to use interface. Every smartphone could become a sophisticated banking platform where users can transact and place orders on the go. Users can use it to send and receive a vast range of digital assets, pay for deliveries, shop online securely because it has the latest security functionality. \r\n\r\n\r\n The mobile application will also be made available on iOS (Apple Play Store) soon, the app will serve as a mobile payment gateway, users will be able to use digital assets to pay for services rendered to them instead of the use FIAT (Government issued currency.) that was traditionally used for payment. The wallet supports all ERC-20 tokens, all EOS tokens, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Core, Litecoin, Dash, Ethereum, Waves, Bitcore, and many others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOIN ECONOMICS\r\n\r\nCOIN NAME: CHIMPION\r\nTICKER: BNANA\r\nNETWORK: EOS COMPATIBLE\r\nTOTAL SUPPLY: 100 BILLION BNANA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOIN ALLOCATION\r\n\r\nTEAM & ADVISORY: 5.15%\r\nMARKETING: 7.22%\r\nFOUNDATION PAYROLL: 10.31%\r\nSTRATEGY PARTNERS: 15.46%\r\nCOMMUNITY AIRDROP: 61.86%\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nCONTACT INFORMATION FOR NEWS & UPDATES\r\n\r\n\u2666 WEBSITE: \r\n\r\n\u2666 WHITEPAPER: \r\n\r\n\u2666 FACEBOOK: \r\n\r\n\u2666 TWITTER: \r\n\r\n\u2666 TELEGRAM: \r\n\r\n\u2666 YOUTUBE: \r\n\r\n\u2666 INSTAGRAM: \r\n\r\n\u2666 EMAIL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE PUBLISHED BY ELOHOR NWADOZI \r\n\r\n\u2666 BOUNTY0X PROFILE: AJOKPA\r\n\r\n",

            "text": "Cryptocrytocurrencies like Bitcoin is made by a difficult cryptographic process called Mining. Mining activities involve repeatedly solving the hash algorithm until a valid solution for the mining challenge is currently found. After the miner is found, he has the right to make a new currency unit. This is called block compensation. To ensure that digital currencies are not subject to unlimited inflation, compensation for blocks is reduced regularly. This data classification produces a graph representing the total circulation of coins, which is called the coin emission coefficient. Even though Wolfcoin is based on Bitcoin, the level of coin spending is significantly changed to increase the coin sign from time to time. Wolfcoin as Bitcoin divides every 400,000 blocks to reduce inflation.\n\nTransactions in the Wolfcoin network are recorded in blocks on blockchain. The size of each transaction is measured in bytes. However, there is no need to connect high-value transactions with the number of bytes needed to process transactions. Conversely, the number of transactions is influenced by how many inputs and outputs are included because more data must be stored in blocks to store this information. Each new block is produced by Masternodes and Miners who are given block prizes for completing block building work. To prevent the network from making spam transactions, the size of each block is artificially limited. With the increase in transaction volume, storage space in each block is a rare asset. Because Matnocker and miners are not required to make an agreement on the blocks they produce after completing the block, the costs of voluntary transactions can be given as incentives to miners.\n\n\nSUBSCRIPTION REWARDS ON THE WOLFPACKBOT PLATFORM\n\nPupBOT 1 month $40 400 267 200\n\r\nWolfBOT 1 month $65 650 433 325\n\r\nWerewolfBOT 1 month $100 1,000 667 500\n\r\nPupBOT 1 year $400 4,000 2667 2,000\n\r\nWolfBOT 1 year + 2 months $750 7,500 5,000 3,750\n\r\nWerewolfBOT 1 year + 2 months $1,250 12,500 8,333 6,250\n\r\nWerewolfBOT + \n\r\nWolfBOX Console 2 years\r\n \r\nWolfBOX is yours to keep\r\n$3,000 30,000 20,000 15,000\n\r\nWolfBOX Console WolfBOX is yours to keep $600 6,000 4,000 3,000\n\nVisit: https://www.wolfpackbot.com/\n\nhttps://www.wolfpackbot.com/Pdf/whitepaper_en.pdf\n\nBountyox username : Iphygurl ",

Over the next 18 months, Xcoynz will prove its market share in the future, provide an optimum level of token recycling, secure business expansion and ultimately increase aggregate attractiveness for the token. To this end, XCOYNZ will implement a program to burn a certain proportion of the collected tokens, and will write a fixed portion of our business profits as much as possible when all components of the platform are started and fully functional.\n\n These fundamental uses of the XCNZ token will drive the value of the token, incentivise circulation and push demand. Furthermore, there will be a drive to optimise our token demand through a strategic token-burn programme, writing off a fixed share of our business profits.\n\n **The Problem of Commerce**  \n\nYou got Bitcoin. You paid all your wages, and you found a wallet you were happy to keep in. What are you doing now? If your goal is a long-term investment, you don't have to do anything. Just make sure the wallet's fixed. However, if we are looking at mass adoption, the coins should not be diverted and kept away. So we must be able to spend them on goods and services, and we can do it easily. Unfortunately, the existing payment systems are not refined and limited. Most business owners do not want to accept flat crypto transactions because of their fiat value variability and poor integration with existing e-commerce and accounting systems, while most businesses do not accept short-term crypto payments.\n\n **Our Solution** \n\nXCOYNZ payment gateway closes this gap. Our subscription service, an important connector between buyers and sellers, enables businesses to seamlessly accept payments for goods and services in crypto currencies through a simple API and with accepted currencies. When a buyer goes to buy, they are asked for the smart algorithm wallet login information and the default settings are loaded (that is, preferred payment currency). When working with our smart algorithm wallet, payments are directly transferred or converted to the retailer's preferred payment method by the consumer in the most cost-effective way.\n\n[XCOYNZ Website](https://www.xcoynz.com/#home)\n\n[Whitepaper](https://www.xcoynz.io/WhitePaper-Full.html)\n\nBounty0x username : Emrah0406",

            "text": "It is more that ten years that cryptocurrency originated, with Bitcoin being the first and way maker. Other cryptocurrencies are collectively called altcoins (from alternative coins). Most of these tokens are sold through initial coin offering, ICO, to investors with the funds raised expected to be used for product development. These tokens are often listed on exchanges so that investors can trade it for other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, or for fiat. Exchanges therefore play prominent role in the transfer of value and provision liquidity for tokens by providing a marketplace for traders.\n\nExchange users are mostly confronted with various issues on different exchange platforms, whether centralized or decentralized exchanges. Most existing centralized exchanges do not empower their users with any tangible rights even though they are fuel upon which the platform runs, asides the risks of hack due to centralized storage of user funds and assets. While decentralized exchanges are trustless, privacy-centric and secure, they are limited in their ability to process very large amounts of orders and transaction speeds can become slow due to network issues. These call for new innovative blockchain-powered solutions for exchange users. \n\nHere comes CoinCasso.\nCoinCasso is a hybrid exchange that merges the best of centralized and decentralized exchanges together in one platform while offering multiple products based on blockchain technology. The main focus of the exchange is customer. CoinCasso Exchange builds its platform and operations around its customers such that users have influence and voting rights over the affairs and operations of the exchange.\n\nUnlike other exchanges where token listing is the exclusive prerogative of the exchange owners, CoinCasso allows its users to decide what tokens they want listed on the exchange through democratic means of voting.\n\nIn order to develop the project, CoinCasso is offering its token, CCX. This token will fuel the platform development and exchange with other cryptocurrencies, and it inherently offers power and benefits to its holders. These include higher profit sharing reward up to 80%, discount on trading fees, preferential voting rights, higher affiliate commission bonus, product testing preference, among others.\n\nTo CoinCasso, customer is everything. From various user experience, it is evident that neither centralized exchanges nor decentralized ones can meet the needs of users and challenges of servicing a large number of customers satisfactorily, CoinCasso's customer-centric hybrid exchange will change all that and usher in a new era of user experience on cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nWEBSITE: https://coincasso.io/\n\nWHITEPAPER: https://coincasso.io/ENGLISH_CoinCasso_official_PLV1.pdf?v1.1\n\nBounty0x username: Mexite",

This generator uses optical devices to produce a real time encryption and decryption system.\n\nThe company to planning to raise funds through two phases one is silver token sale (without the key encryption) and the next phase will be gold token sale (with key encryption).\n\nThe first ICO will be an ethereum ICO and the next ICO will be a bitcoin ICO (2018). The global Quantum1NET is planned to be the first quarter of 2019 which is a pretty realistic goal as the team is already working towards their goal since 2014. The authenticity of the project can be confirmed by the laboratory prototype shown in their white paper. The ICO funds will be used by the company to build a development team which will empower and hasten the process of building Quantum1NET.\n\nThe silver token holders will be offered an exclusive restricted gold token sale where they can convert their silver tokens to gold token (at 20% discount). For other people who do not hold the silver coins already the company is planning to have an independent offering later.\n\nThe developers of the project are offering convertible tokens initially so that the buyers do not have to wait patiently for long rather they can easily convert them into gold tokens which will be quantum encrypted hence will become the \u201cproof-of-work\u201d  \ndata source: ([https://quantum1net.com/Q1N%20white%20paper.pdf](https://quantum1net.com/Q1N%20white%20paper.pdf)).\n\n*Cap of silver coins = \u20ac15 million; Date = February 2018*\n\n*Cap of restricted gold sale = \u20ac18 million; Date = July 2018*\n\n*Cap of open gold sale = \u20ac200 million; Date = January 2018*\n\n([https://quantum1net.com/](https://quantum1net.com/))\n\n**Why to invest in Quantum1NET and what are the potential risks?**\n\nThe project CEO Mattias Bergstrom is a well known name in the tech industry with 20 years of experience and has over 60 patents under his name. The CTO of the company Stan Miasnikov has over 25 years of experience and has worked with LLC (to develop quantum computing) and hence knows the risks and threats of a quantum computer.\n\nThe only risk attached to the project is that they are protecting against something which \u2018looks\u2019 far away from human reach(quantum computers) but as they say prevention is better than cure and hence this ICO is the clarion call. It is definitely the future of encryption and protection against something that will surely pose a big problem if definite measures are not taken.\n\nWebsite: ([https://quantum1net.com/](https://quantum1net.com/))  \nWhitepaper: ([https://quantum1net.com/Q1N%20white%20paper.pdf](https://quantum1net.com/Q1N%20white%20paper.pdf))  \nOfficial Twitter: ([https://twitter.com/quantum1net](https://twitter.com/quantum1net))  \nYouTube Channel: ([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuoxA6BGOOVNdwef3eHMKoA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuoxA6BGOOVNdwef3eHMKoA))\n\n**Participate in the ICO** \\> ([https://quantum1net.com/](https://quantum1net.com/)) \n\nBounty0x ID: chemist32",

The overall fork took place by utilizing two different blockchains and in the end result creating one bilaterally operating dual blockchain. The Peercoin Blockchain is what our entire development will begin on, during this time, the Bitcoin UTXO was added along with several core features including Lightning Network, Segregated Witness, and Atomic Swaps.\n\nBitcoin Air will also be implementing its side-chaining method that will allow people to off chain their XAP to a stable value USDAP. The users receiving Bitcoin Air at the time of the fork will be holders of Peercoin and Bitcoin at a ratio that will be announced closer to the fork date.\n\nBitcoin Air began by increasing the size of the Blocks to 32 MB each, reducing the block time to 4 minute targets, doubling the tail emission of Bitcoin, maintaining the block reward of 12.5 XAP, and introducing Hybrid Dynamic Proof-of-Stake/Proof-of-Work Consensus. All of this coupled with the backing of a Clean Air Initiative.\nTo get more detail about this project: https://bitcoinair.org/\n\n",

            "text": " \n\n**Atomic Wallet - The Best Universal Litecoin Wallet!**\n\n \n\nHello, valuable crypto money followers. In this article, I would like to talk to you about the Atomic Wallet project.\n\nJust as we all know that the cryptocurrency industry have gotten to a level where it can\u2019t be stopped any-longer, we should also remember that this technology is still being faced with the challenge of fiat to crypto exchange because several individuals that are interested in purchasing and investing in cryptocurrencies do not have a good platform to easily convert their local currencies to bitcoin or other crypto assets.\n\n**Atomic wallet team have recognised this cogent issue and as such, they have come up with the great solution of integrating Simplex which is the largest licensed card processing company in the European Union**.\n\nAtomic wallet as we all know is a multi-feature wallet which affords its users the ability to store and manage 300+ cryptocurrencies, exchange their cryptocurrencies assets easily into other cryptocurrencies, monitor the current price of the supported cryptocurrencies among other features.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/70jl7ysdwc531.jpg?width=903&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6611edc9f52dc4327766af306a278e7cdd696339)\n\n**What Does the Project Promise?**\n\nIndeed the task is focused; to deal with our crypto cash resources dependably and to work through a progressively secure framework. So how is this going to be? A standout amongst the most critical issues that separates the Atomic Wallet venture from different activities is; rather than crypto trades on this stage, rather than keeping all crypto keys on the stock trades, they keep this data on clients\u2019 gadgets. The clarification is that; We are never again ready to take our private keys and we are exceptionally protected. This is a great improvement \u2026\n\n### What are the exceptional features of this wallet\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ability to control your private keys by yourself only\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Private and anonymous transactions which prevents you from being hacked\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Easy to use built in cryptocurrency exchange\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Excellent user interface\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Always active customer support\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reliable security measures which ensures the safety of users\u2019 funds\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Very cheap and affordable transaction fees\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/5op0pevhwc531.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8ba61b23786fcf9121689a1ab7bc1ed4f6d0b56)\n\n### What is Litecoin wallet?\n\nYou need to use a program to manage your Litecoins, it will keep your private keys and provide additional functions such as sending, receiving, exchanging, and more. With these programs, you\u2019re able to manage and control your funds.\n\n### Signs of a good Litecoin Wallet\n\n**1. Security.**\u00a0Wallet security means the way your Litecoins and other cryptos are protected from frauds and hacking, how you manage private keys and what security technologies a particular wallet supports.\n\n**2. Accessibility.**\u00a0This feature implies simplicity in use and the ability to withdraw your funds from the wallet. A friendly user interface is a vital point for new users. When choosing a\u00a0litecoin wallet, pay attention to its interface and the amounts you are able to operate with.\n\n**3. Functionality.**\u00a0If you want to choose a good LTC wallet, check it for additional services support, such as an ability to exchange cryptocurrency or\u00a0buy crypto with a bank-card/paypal, etc.) In some wallets, like Atomic or Exodus, it\u2019s possible to exchange Litecoin right in the application without visiting third party websites. Cryptocurrency will be transferred directly on your address after the exchange.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/h60bjr6nwc531.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=597766d55d38f60f4030b9b32da19739c2bd3f72)\n\n**How does the framework work?**\n\nA standout amongst the most loved pieces of the stage is; individuals can make their very own requests for the trade between digital currencies, and they can be incorporated into the change orders made by others, this is extremely extraordinary \u2026\n\nTo clarify this with a precedent; Let\u2019s say I have a tad of Litecoin. I would prefer not to transform this Litecoini into dollars or Btc. So I need to get Lost with Ltc straightforwardly. You can change over Ltc to Iost by means of Exchange over the stage. You can even enter the sum physically in the event that you need. Right now you endorse the Exchange procedure, the Atomic Wallet begins the procedure to compute the most fitting commission and exchange the token at the greatest rate with the base expense. In this manner, as in the Ethereum framework, the cost of Gas isn\u2019t given to the reasons, for example, the low token isn\u2019t sent tokenize.\n\nThe Atomic Wallet application has been deliberately arranged to be utilized on each stage to contact all crowds. These stages; MacOS, Windows, Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora.\n\n**4. Customer Support.**\u00a0This is a vitally important to receive a fast reply on users concerns and help with troubleshooting. Good customer care is a sign of a good product. How fast will the support team help you, if you have any troubles? Crypto market is too volatile to wait days/weeks till someone will the issue. It is a good practice to reply within 24 hours.\n\n**How to setup Litecoin Wallet**\n\nManage your Litecoin wisely! Learn how to setup Atomic Wallet to send, receive, exchange and buy LTC.\n\nBuy Litecoin in a secure way\n\n**Install Atomic Wallet**\n\nDownload the app. Atomic is a free and secure place to manage Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and more than 300+ assets.\n\n**Verify your Identity**\n\nVerification is required to prevent identity theft or fraud. Photo ID is required to make sure it's really you.\n\n**Get Litecoin**\n\nStart with $50 and up to $20,000 daily. Receive crypto on your wallet. Credit/Debit cards accepted. Get Wallet\n\n**Buy Litecoin with Credit Card**\n\nThere are many ways to buy Litecoin (exchanges, hot wallets), but one of the most secure way to buy LTC is to use Atomic Wallet. With Atomic, you can easily purchase LTC, BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH and hold 300+ coins and tokens in one place where only you control your funds. Hold them and manage with comfortable interface.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can buy Litecoin with VISA/MasterCard right in the interface of Atomic Walletand convert your USD or EUR to LTC. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven if you have a JPY, CAD or any other currency card, those currencies are automatically converted to either EUR or USD, depending on your choice. It\u2019s quite easy to use and doesn\u2019t require specific tech skills.\n\n \n\n### Rates and Security\n\nThe fees are fixed at 7%. Each operation is fully conducted by Simplex, an EU licensed card processing company. You choose an amount and currency to buy and verify your ID. Then your bank holds funds until Simplex approves the request and makes an exchange. As a rule, you receive crypto in 24 hours.\n\nAs a result, the creation of an appropriate application will undoubtedly increase the use of the Atom Wallet for some customers. According to the designers, more than 100,000 people have downloaded the Atom Wallet since the effort was disbanded. Most people use the wallet routinely. This is an approved sign of trust in the wallet! I'm sure that the full delivery of compact apps on Android and iOS will be another upgrade to attract new customers.\n\n**This review is the author's personal opinion, based on information from public sources and is certainly not a trade or investment advice.**\n\n### For more information about the project:\n\n* WEBSITE:\u00a0[https://atomicwallet.io/](https://atomicwallet.io/)\n* WHITEPAPER:\u00a0[https://download.atomicwallet.io/atomicwallet-whitepaper.pdf](https://download.atomicwallet.io/atomicwallet-whitepaper.pdf)\n* ANN BITCOINTALK:\u00a0[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4437510.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4437510.0)\n* TELEGRAM:\u00a0[https://t.me/atomicwalletchat](https://t.me/atomicwalletchat)\n* FACEBOOK:\u00a0[https://www.facebook.com/atomicwallet](https://www.facebook.com/atomicwallet)\n* TWITTER:\u00a0[https://twitter.com/atomicwallet](https://twitter.com/atomicwallet)\n\nAuthor: hussnill\n\nBitcoinTalk Profil:\u00a0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2392652",

            "text": " Hello, I want to talk a little bit about this project, I want to give you information about how it will make your life easier. If we go back to the beginning of the blockchain journey, we can start with the appearance of Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency on January 3, 2009. A structure would not work, and how the value would be determined.  \n\n\nThis issue has been discussed for a long time, but during this time Bitcoin's market value. This rise led to the formation of alternative cryptocurrencies, leading to the formation of the current cryptocurrency market. \n\n[ However, in this context, we will not talk  about the future of the crypto money market or what sub-coins to invest.  As we mentioned in the title, our current position is the use of  Blockchain technology in digital marketing, which is based on Bitcoin  and other cryptocurrencies.](https://preview.redd.it/i4ucfovx6a431.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f5e924e749a2df4ebef61749546a4490323c138)\n\nWe  can define Blockchain technology as a distributed database that  provides encrypted transaction tracking. As the name implies, a chained  model, Blockchain technology, which is closely monitored, enables  transactions to be performed independently of a center, so that  transactions can be carried out directly between the buyer and the  seller. This situation can be compared to sharing personal music through  Napster.\n\nEven  some experts who suspect that Bitcoin itself today believe that  blockchain technology will benefit in many areas. Blockchain technology,  which is expanding its development and usage areas in digital marketing  and all other mass industries with its secure infrastructure, continues  to develop by changing the way many sectors work.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/nhlk3ynh7a431.jpg?width=595&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1035b929c27c37e0ec51181f1723f182144c1941)\n\n**What is the Wibson?**\n\nWibson  can be described as a blockchain-based, Decentralized,  Privacy-Preserving Data Marketplace or dPDM. It is a decentralized  information marketplace that is secure, reliable and transparent and  allows effective and efficient movement of private information by  individuals that is approved for such services and purposes.\n\nWibson  Token with a Ticker known as WIB, is the traditional token of the  Wibson platform. The WIB is built on Ethereum smart contract network. It  is also a utility token. Since WIB utility token is built on Ethereum  smart contract it will in turn help facilitate data exchange on WIBSON  network/platform and also provide a great amount of data value on the  network.\n\nTokens derived from these  activities mentioned above will be burned, this will, in turn, reduce  the amount of WIB in circulation and it will also help increase the  market value of WIB due to token scarcity. Worthy of note is the fact  that after Initial Coin Offering (ICO) no WIB token will ever be  created, minted or mined.\n\nThe  availability of the WIB will further fuel the development of the network  and also provide fast, secure, transparent, efficient transactions on  the Wibson platform. WIB will be used for all forms of transaction,  services and purchase (buying and selling of stored data) carried out on  the Wibson platform. Holders possess certain privileges which include:  registration as the storage nodes (this simply means paid fees for  storing data or transmitting data) and participation in the data market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kcaqxjks7a431.jpg?width=597&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f102423c03e3c11eb05264f5443c3f8f85493120\n\n \n\n**D\u0435\u0441\u0435ntr\u0430l\u0456z\u0435d Pr\u0456v\u0430\u0441\u0443-Pr\u0435\u0455\u0435rv\u0456ng D\u0430t\u0430 Marketplace**\n\nW\u0456b\u0455\u043en  Data Marketplace \u0456\u0455 a br\u0435\u0435d\u0456ng gr\u043eund for information esteem  \u0430uth\u0435nt\u0456\u0441\u0430t\u0456\u043en between makers \u0430nd th\u0435\u0456r relating \u0441\u043en\u0455um\u0435r\u0455.

As we know that cryptocurrency is a fluctuating price digital asset.\n\nBitcoin has a limited supply, while demand continues to increase so that conditions make prices go faster. Such is the market cryptocurrency system that makes prices fluctuate. Maybe for some ordinary people, it sounds like a waste of time if you study cryptocurrency. Do you know? In addition, bitcoin is a technological breakthrough innovation that unites decentralization and trust, where both of them in 2009 are still two things that cannot be combined technology.\n\nCryptocurrency uses decentralized technology that allows users to make secures payments and save money without the need to use their identity or go to the bank. They take turns in a distributed large cash book called the blockchain, which records all transactions and is held by the owner of the currency. If fiat money has a bank to save assets, then what about digital assets? Javvy will provide a solution that suits your needs.\n\n **Why is Javvy different?** \n\nMaybe you have heard so many companies or projects that offer solutions for a wallet for the cryptocurrency. Then what are the differences and advantages that Jawy has? By adopting the Blockchain technology, Cryptocurrency is known to be safe and provides a high level of anonymity. Transactions in it cannot be falsified or reversed, and are usually low in cost so that they can rely on more than conventional currencies. Decentralized means that they are available to anyone. Certainly very different from the Bank system where not everyone can open an account.\n\nAs we know that the existence of cryptocurrency is still illegal in some countries because it has different regulations. Then, how does Javvy solve it?\n\nJavvy is a secure, comprehensive crypto wallet with built-in decentralized crypto exchange aggregator solution (not web-based) that will support all expected operations for all significant cryptocurrencies and tokens. Jawy will earn revenue from the tried-and-true method of fees on buy/sell transactions, conversion fees, KYCIAML/Accreditation verification services, international debit card fees, and merchant settlement fees.\n\nJavvy combines a comprehensive wallet & exchange answer to overcome the protection deficiencies of web-based wallets and exchanges. As previously mentioned, Javvy is presently following and ready to adapt to evolving regulations within the future. Moreover, with the potential for Javvy to integrate itself with exchanges that host edict pairings, we tend to are probably to witness a wallet/exchange solution that dwarfs the competition.\n\nWith a useful crypto wallet already released and an ICO is ongoing, Javvy is pushing forward with a certified teaming of security. While Javvy is utilizing a wallet front-end with a decentralize back-end, their nearest competitor on stable in-house currencies.\n\nJawy is excellent news for crypto fans by providing several choices for exchange and also the wallets it uses square measure large and grows at a major level. Such a large amount of comes fail. However, Javvy can build a distinction and alter within the crypto area.\n\nAs technology and digital currencies evolve, Javvy offers various benefits for crypto space. By having an expert and professional team, Jawy has outstanding progress in the long run. In addition to strict regulatory \n\n&#x200B;",

            "text": "Cryptocurrency mining is a computational process that seeks to solve cryptographic problems. Mining is instrumental to the decentralized nature of non-premined tokenized assets and also ensures issuance of new coins into circulation. For blockchain built based on proof-of-work (PoW) consensus such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash and others, mining is a must as it ensures validation of transactions and security of the network. For successfully mining a block, a miner is awarded a stipulated number of that crypto asset.\nThe equipment required for crypto mining are often high-grade and specialized for the task due to the high amount of hash rate (computational power) required to decrypt block or mine. While in the very early times of cryptocurrency, classic CPUs (central processing units) could be used to profitably mine crypto, doing so today will amount to a total waste of time and resources because of the difficulty level of mining which has been raised and will still be raised on an ongoing basis.\n\nToday, the mining industry is dominated by large mining firms with high-grade specialized mining rigs. The competition cannot be survived, in terms of economy of returns, by individual or small-scale miners because of the large capital intensive nature of the business. People are therefore turning to investing in these mining farms\u00a0 with the promise of sharing in the mining rewards accrued to the operations of the miner.\n\nThese mining service companies mostly pass liabilities on to their investors by conducting ICOs with amplified risks of loss of capital to the retail investor. For example, the mining company could cancel mining contracts in the event of unprofitable mining service without considering the investors. MinedBlock presents a mining solution different from existing ones.\n\nMinedBlock plans to build a dedicated mining facility that will enhance profitability through a multi-pronged business approach. Firstly, MinedBlock is a registered limited liability company with the intent to raise funds needed to establish and run the mining facility optimally through a security token offering (STO) based on Polymath ST20 standard. The security tokens, MBTX, represent one preference share in MinedBlock Holding Limited. This implies that investors are investing in a real company.\n\nSecondly, token holders are entitled to 75% of the revenue generated from the mining service. This dividends will be issued monthly and initially in ethereum tokens, with the option of distribution in other tokens mined by the company. Additionally, MinedBlock plans to mine multiple cryptocurrencies and switch over to the more economically rewarding token depending on the difficulty level and mining success rate. Finally, there is also strategy to diversify investment by considering the options of: belonging to an existing mining pool to maximize profit and running master nodes to create additional stream of income. These exemplify the commitment and multiprong approach of MinedBlock to running the mining service profitably. \n\nThe opportunities in blockchain are diverse. Cryptocurrency mining represents one of the major markets that can be leveraged to generate revenue. MinedBlock is set to not only lower the entry barrier into crypto mining but also provide a secure and reduced risk share-backed access. \n\n\nFor more information on MinedBlock:\nWebsite: https://www.minedblock.io/\n\nWhitepaper: https://www.minedblock.io/assets/MinedBlockWhitepaper.pdf\n\nBounty0x username: Mexite",

The Chimpion's network is fast with user-friendly interface and all transactions are affordable. The Chimpion platform came into existence through innovative technology from e-commerce provider such as Bitcoin Diamond foundation (BCD), Shopping Cart Elite (SCE), Paytomat and combinations of a wide range of e-commerce functionalities with expedient payment processing system. The gateway to Chimpion's robust digital assets platform is to hold Chimpion (CHIMP) and every holder of CHIMP is entitled to a free monthly subscription fee.\n\nThe Chimpion platform created a dual token dynamic which is the Chimpion (CHIMP) and the Banana token (BNANA) that works like points on a loyalty card (redeemable for discounts, exclusive and promotional offers). The e-commerce merchant's storefronts and e-commerce environment are power-driven by CHIMP to incentivize merchants for their adoption of Chimpion's platform. The CHIMP will be the fundamental currency coinage in the Chimpion's store featuring Chimpion's product line and directory while the BNANA serves as the reward layer of the platform in the sense that users earn BNANA via buying of goods and services from Chimpion's merchants when they make use of CHIMP or another cryptocurrency.\n\nChimpion plays a major role as a checkout scheme and payment processing system that supports stable coins such as USDT, TUSD, USDC, GUSD (NYDFS-approved), and PAX (NYDFS-approved).\n\n\n**ADVANTAGES OF USING CHIMPION'S PLATFORM**\n\n+ Merchants have access to advance search engine optimization;\n\n+ Merchants are able to circumvent chargeback fraud;\n\n+ Customers have access to exclusive retail stores anywhere in the world;\n\n+ Customers can instantaneously exchange crypto-to-fiat and withdraw to their bank account;\n\n+ Customers earns BNANA token via loyalty programs.\n\n\n\n**BITCOIN DIAMOND PAY WALLET**\n\nThe BCD pay wallet is incorporated to the Chimpion's platform as a payment gateway that enables users to use cryptocurrency (ERC20 tokens, EOS tokens, BCD, Bitcore, Ethereum, waves, NEM, Zcoin, Horizon, and lots more) of their choice to pay for goods and services online. The BDC pay wallet is a multi-crypto wallet that does not save users private key. The BCD pay wallet is downloadable on Android smartphones as an APK file \ud83d\udc49https://www.chimpion.io/download/bcd-pay-wallet.apk or from the Google Play store \ud83d\udc49https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bcd.pay.wallet with an iOS version coming soon on Apple Appstore.\n\nMerchants, startups, or existing projects can list their coin or token via the BCD pay wallet for the payment of goods and services online by filling this form \ud83d\udc49https://bcdpay.typeform.com/to/KBOO4C\n\n\n**CHIMPION COIN INFORMATION**\n\nBNANA is the native currency of Chimpion created on the EOS blockchain making it an EOS compliant that will be used as a standard means of payment and reward across the platform.

This is the same with MinedBlock.\n\n**MinedBlock Competitive Advantages**\n\n1. Scalable: MinedBlock\u2019s service is scalable and in order to grow the service, the team tends to simply install and configure more mining equipment, without any technical limitation. MinedBlock will be built to have the ability to quickly and easily expand into multiple revenue streams including the expansion of the range of mined crypto assets and the ability to host private mining services.\n\n2. Agile: To start with, 40% of MinedBlock infrastructure will be dedicated to cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin, thereby making it possible for the service to flex and switch between the asset being mined while allowing the team to always target the assets with the best returns based on market demand. Furthermore, the 60% initial allocation to Bitcoin can also be adjusted based on market prices and returns. \n\n3. Sustainable: MinedBlock will achieve this by hosting its infrastructure in areas that can provide 100% renewable energy. \n\n4. Market Immunity: After the platform has been launched, the second Phase of the project will be to build the platform's\nown renewable energy sources to offset electricity costs. The reason for this primary ongoing cost factor is to enable continuous revenue production regardless of the nature of the crypto market.\n\n5. Projected Revenue: MinedBlock will be able to generate revenue through mining a strategically selected range of\ncryptocurrencies. Another way to generate revenue while also mining crypto is to buy and hold a minimum number of a coin in a wallet which entitles the holder to a share of transaction fees. In the same way, since there are always technological advances in the mining industry including these strategies and technologies will make the MinedBlock project to adapt and grow.\n\n6. Unique Selling Point (USP): MinedBlock USP when compared to the competition is that the team plans to make the platform fully immune from the market, prioritise investors and be 100% transparent in everything. \nWhere most other mining firms have focused on just \u2018out of the box\u2019 mining while not considering any form of cost reduction or alternative revenue generation such as masternodes has ended up being unprofitable for them and unable to continue. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe aim of MinedBlock goes far beyond just being another mining company, the team intend to dominate the space as quickly as possible owing to the fact at this stage or phase there isn\u2019t really any meaningful competitor in the marketplace as the mining industry is still in its infancy.\n\n**For More Information;**\n\nWebsite:\u00a0https://www.minedblock.io/\n\nWhitepaper:\u00a0https://www.minedblock.io/assets/MinedBlockWhitepaper.pdf\n\nBounty0x Username: Emmy92",

            "text": " \n\n**Introduction**\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges are one of the most vital applications of the Blockchain industry. The capability of accessing crypto assets, trading them and securely storing them away from the bad actors are a huge responsibility that goes beyond the expectations of a conventional exchange. While some of the pioneers in Fintech and Blockchain financial services have managed to explore the crypto world with \u00e9lan, many have fallen prey to the inherent and vicious cycle of fraud attacks.\n\nIn this blog, we take a look at the top centralised competitors of our BankDex decentralised multicurrency exchange and analyse how it fares better than its counterparts.\n\nEven after 10 years since the conception of the first crypto asset, the debate\u200a\u2014\u200acentralised vs decentralised is still on. The primary distinction between a centralised and decentralised exchange lies in ownership. Although the concept of centralised exchanges have been in existence since long, decentralised exchanges (a model created with the advent of crypto assets and an immutable, transparent ledger) is relatively new. BankDex integrates the best of both concepts on its cross chain platform, enabling a smooth and fast trading experience to its users.\n\nBlockchain allows the creation of a market place for the exchange of assets without oversight or permission and keeping track of the asset ownership without the help pf a third party. The advantages and limitations of the exchanges lay within the bounds of 5 distinct areas namely\u200a\u2014\u200aanonymity, fees, fiat to crypto transfer, ownership and liquidity. Before we analyse the benefits of BankDex over the top centralised exchanges in market, let\u2019s have a brief look at the working of a centralised exchange.\n\n \n\n**Centralisation in Cryptocurrency Exchanges**\n\nToday, the blockchain industry acts as the marketplace for exchanges that take the role of a trusted third party in asset transfer or exchange. To be more specific, centralised exchanges act as the custodian of user funds, unlike decentralised exchanges were the assets are completely held by the clients themselves. A traditional centralised exchange holding its client\u2019s fiat, crypto assets or both is considered both as a custodian as well as an exchange. Besides, the exchanges which provide functionalities such as margin trading function on lines of a prime broker as well.\n\nSome of the most popular exchanges in the market like Binance and Coinbase are centralised in nature. They act as the conventional gateway to the crypto world. For many, having a cryptocurrency exchange hold their funds is not a problem. However, the same cannot be said of all, especially the institutional investors. Centralised custody in these exchanges often presents the threat of counter party risks.\n\n**Working of a centralised exchange**\n\nWhen you deposit funds in a centralised exchange, you are actually giving it money, that is the digital assets in your account or wallet is transferred directly into the bank account or the wallet associated with the exchange. The balance seen in the exchange account or wallet is essentially produced as the result of the database entry which is updated by the cryptocurrency exchange. The funds in the exchange are mingled together with the fund of the exchange. The cryptocurrency exchange is the lone source of trust with regards to the balance of the clients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rypvqfuirj731.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=29b6b77fb1c6baab85d307c9bc37500cef72ae36\n\n \n\nThe present day cryptocurrency trade is structured in such a way that certain companies hold billions of dollars\u2019 worth of cryptocurrencies of customers. The counterparty risk with is one of the main concerns in crypto trading platforms are centralised by companies that hold the funds, execute trades and trade, finance & leverage for conducting trade on self-owned accounts on the platform. As mentioned earlier, the cryptocurrency exchange platform is the only source of truth for the funds of the exchanges.\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets have always urged for three main concepts:\n\n\u00b7 The funds should be held by appropriate entities only. These entities, be it banks or custodians should be able to keep these assets from theft or loss. Decentralization rose in popularity mainly due to this aspect. In decentralized exchange, the fund is held under the custody of the trader and there is no involvement from any third party.\n\n\u00b7 Counterparty risks should be centralised or handled by any selected and dedicated entity. No conventional exchange takes these risks upon themselves and are usually handled by clearing houses which may not be competent authority to ensure security. BankDex overcomes this problem through its decentralised solutions.\n\n\u00b7 The need of a trust less solution. The market needs to implement a trading platform similar to the Bitcoin network that ensures a trustless interaction between the entities involved in the transaction. This will ensure that an investor pays the accurate price and is not cheated or subjected to fraud by the other participants in a trading lifecycle.\n\nThe BankDex decentralized multicurrency exchange implements these concepts to create a trading platform that is secure, simple and is accessible by both beginners and seasoned traders.\n\n \n\n**BankDex vs Popular Centralised Exchanges: A Comparison Analysis**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oj5atmhsrj731.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e9ff4fd587d8d86d866254d15e53a4d5bb19625\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aot9wbptrj731.jpg?width=650&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=463f8985b03781f10fe643da0564f530a033474a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yzo9qezurj731.jpg?width=648&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c79d2854a1765a899d9763490ecd0774306339e8\n\n \n\n* **Website:**  [https://www.bankdex.io](https://www.bankdex.io/) \n* Bounty0x ID: hussnill",

            "text": " \n\nThe RSA cryptographic platform is currently 40 years of age. Despite the fact that it has worked well in securing Internet and digital interchanges, the day is tallied because of Moore\u2019s unremitting legitimate advance and the development of Quantum registering. Critical endeavors and assets are utilized by programmers to split RSA and encryption.  \nWith Quantum figuring, each quantum bit (called a qubit) can both be zero and one in the meantime. This distinction implies that Quantum PCs can store more information, and accomplish more counts every second, influencing it to ideal for deciphering applications. The ascent of Quantum processing makes RSA splitting and different types of encryption attainable sooner rather than later. The established PC utilizes paired bits, which have an estimation of zero and one. Quantum computers are considered more developed than ordinary computers as these are able to exploit the unique features of the microscopic world, entanglement, and superposition to make the calculation more accurate and effective.\n\nTokens  \nQuantum1Net dispatches two sorts of tokens: the principal Silver Token that can be changed over in February 2018 without quantum key encryption, and boundless discharge quantum keys extricated on Gold Token in July 2018. Silver token holders can change their proprietorship at a rebate. The full arrangement of Gold Token and Quantum1Net is right now planned for January 2019.\n\n \n\n**Why is Quantum1NET claiming to be the future of encryption services ?**\n\nThe claims made by Quantum1NET are supported by their substantial work in the field of encryption especially their quantum encryption key generator (QEKG). This key generator is much more efficient and secure key generator as compared to the contemporary generator deployed by the RSA system which is pseudo-random and cannot be predicted easily with advanced quantum computing power.\n\nThe main threat in this era of \u2018supercomputers\u2019 is quantum computing. The RSA relies on prime-factorization of large numbers as a method for data encryption and quantum computers can easily predict the next set of value by \u2018observing\u2019 a large sample size of keys.\n\nThe quantum computers are technologically more advanced as they do not rely on discreet bits (0 or 1) values to store data. They can exist in multiple states at a time to store information and that leads to faster calculations and less consumption of power and hence are very cost effective.\n\nICO  \nToken Sale # 1: silver token  \nEthereum based  \nFebruary 2018  \nChange over to Gold Token with 20% off  \nDeals cutoff of 15 million\n\nToken Sale # 2: Gold Token  \nJuly 2018  \nBitcoin-based, including QEK  \nSilver Token financial specialists get need  \nDeals point of confinement of 18 million\n\nToken Sale # 3: Gold Token  \nJanuary 2019  \nBitcoin based, QE initiated  \nSilver Investors changing over on July 2018 deals may take an interest at a 5%  \nDeals Limit 200 million\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Bounty0x ID: chemist32",

            "text": " \n\nListening to music is easier than it has ever been. Spotify, Apple Music, and SoundCloud are all ready to fill your ears with more music than you could ever listen to. As a user, you pay a fixed monthly fee for this easy access and the streaming service then passes that money on to the artist right? Well, not quite. The music industry in 2018: YouTubers are stars, stars are brands, brands produce content, content is everything, everything is content, and nobody pays for music. Things have changed a lot in the music business recently.\n\nWhile on one hand, the traditional infrastructure has morphed and shrunk, the individuals who create and engage with the art itself have grown, totally changing the way they think about business, branding, and what it means to have a successful career.\n\nWhat\u2019s been going on in the music industry over the past quarter century has been a steady development towards decentralization. Where once institutions like record labels, studios, distribution centers, and record sales defined what success was in the music business, advents like streaming platforms, digital audio workstations, and the disintermediating power of the internet have eroded the landscape into a more even playing field.\n\nThe potential blockchain technology holds to take the music industry\u200a\u2014\u200aand the entire entertainment industry, for that matter\u200a\u2014\u200ato the next plane is multifarious. Whether it\u2019s through crowdfunding, programmatic IP, distribution, event ticketing, ownership of non-fungible assets and collectibles, streaming, blockchain technology and (sometimes, but not always) digital currencies, blockchain can be used to re-imagine the entire process of how music and art is funded, created, distributed, consumed, and all over again.\n\nThis is why music and entertainment have become some of the most active spaces in the blockchain world for technological development. Many people may look at cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and think that blockchain is all about finance and deep tech that won\u2019t affect them, but scores of music-centric blockchain startups are proving that not only can decentralization create substantive change in the daily lives of everyday people.\n\n[https://imusify.com/](https://imusify.com/)",

If your purchase is made on the Catex exchange, even if you transfer coins to the wrong account, Catex offers you a refund, which is another important feature of Catex that makes it safe when it\u2019s one of the many lost stocks.\n\n* **Dividends (Revenue Sharing)**\n\nOne of the biggest places that distinguishes the Catex Stock Exchange from other exchanges is the Dividend award. The biggest award from this is daily profit and profit sharing up to 90%. This transaction, referred to as a \u201cdividend\u201d on the stock exchange, is a system where you keep your coins in the same bank account, as you do, when you massage, and as a result you receive a daily profit share. As a kind of sleep on your bed when you keep a coin in your hand without any effort can get a share of the profits. The more coins you have, the more profits you receive. As in the same bank, the profit sharing rate you receive increases if you choose 15 days or a higher number of days than one day. Below is a graph of the distribution of dividends within a few days.\n\n* **Mining Bonuses**\n\nWhile mining profits have dropped significantly, it is not wrong to say that mining expenditures are becoming increasingly irrelevant as a result of the philosophy of excessive spending on electricity and energy with a philosophy that is the opposite of Blockchain technology. Catex has different ideas about mining for CATT tokens. On the market, when users buy, they produce buying and selling energy, produce energy for mining CATT tokens and therefore mine without damaging the environment and without additional energy. What\u2019s more, Catex gives users 5% of this digested CATT user advantage. Isn\u2019t that a good idea? I think so.\n\n* **Believing in the Power of Unity**\n\nThe Catex stock market wants to form a community-based committee in accordance with the Blockchain philosophy. This committee is a platform where you can connect with executives with a variety of language choices (English, Turkish, Arabic, Korean, etc.) on various platforms such as telegram groups and even give them advice about the stock market and sites. When you have the opportunity to chat directly with administrators, community problems or ideas can be answered more quickly and the right decisions can be re-formed as consensus. What if there are differences of opinion? The answer to this question was also considered: Catex In its website, it opened a voting system for the solution of current problems and the votes provided by users can be resolved democratically. Indeed, this should be believed in the power of unity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [https://www.catex.io/](https://www.catex.io/)",

To realize the magnitude of the change that is coming you have to think how the \u201cemail\u201d technology changed forever the traditional way of sending letters by what call today \u201csnail mail\u201d. The magic word is \u201cBlockchain technology\u201d, and cryptocurrencies are part of the possibilities that Blockchain technology offers us.\n\nFeatures\n\nInvestors\n\nThe crypto investors are continuously looking for the new \u201cBitcoin\u201d, the new \u201cVerge\u201d, the new \u201cEos\u201d and so on. In fact, they are looking for a project where they can invest and get in return exponential earnings over long periods of time. The search is going on for a new concept, a new idea or a platform that has a global scope approach and will be in continuous expansion. They are looking for companies that will exceed the limits and be capable to generate a mass adoption and profits. They search for projects that have a clear vision on how to precisely reach their objectives and generate value when compared to the rest of the existing crypto projects.\n\nStrong community\n\nOracol Xor is an Open-Source-Platform, that gives you the possibility to interact on a social and financial level within a secure, protected and strong community of investors and like-minded people.Diversify your options. Add to your portfolio Oracol Xor funds and reap the benefits by investing early in a fast growing company that already demonstrated its commitment to become a major player.\n\nTransactions\n\nThe Oracol XOR uses Proof of Work (POW). All transactions are executed between the users directly and not through a centralised organisation. Say \u201cGood Bye\u201d to the middle man and exorbitant transaction fees.Connect with our community and discover like minded people. Read about the platform development and progress. Make new friends and discuss tutorials or help the others to catch up.Make your own group and share the knowledge. You can access the site by clicking the link below.\n\nBeneficial\n\nIn Addition to the goals described in the Withe Paper initially Oracol Xor crypto will monetize Oracol Xor own Social Media platform \u2013 \u201d Oracol World\u201d and the Global News Platform \u201cNEWZ.APP\u201d.This is another incentive to promote and grow both platforms and esdtablish a long term mutual beneficial relation. One thing you can be sure of is that deliver on their promises to expand and the results are tangible not just words to impress the reader. Unlike other projects you can explore and evaluate what we have built.\n\nSocial network\n\nNo successful platform can thrive today without a strong social network presence. Typical examples include Facebook and YouTube, which have a huge number of subscribers. The daily use of social media platforms is increasing yet not a single platform has dedicated its operations to blockchain and cryptocurrency. Oracol Xor aim is to roll out a social media component as part of the platform and incorporate crypto currency usage as a form of payment for online purchase within the app.\n\nAccess the official website for more information:\n\nhttps://oracolxor.io/\n\nhttps://oracolxor.io/whitepaper/index.html",

Even the top most exchange that handled 70% of the world\u2019s bitcoin exchanges have faced most unexpected hack. Yet the hack did not stop there, about 120,000 BTC which was worth $72 million was stolen in August 2016. The hack continued all over the world from small volume exchanges to huge volume exchanges. South Korea have faced $30 million worth of hack in cryptocurrency in 2018. Exchange in India was hacked and over 440 BTC was hacked back in early 2018.\n\nTill date many scams and hacks are ongoing. One of the biggest scam ever is BitConnect where the exact data of users and crypto invested is still unknown. Reports say over 100s of million worth Bitcoin were scammed. All in all over billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies were hacked, stolen, and scammed in this crypto space.\n\nRegulations tightens up to reduce the scam and there are few restrictions to control the scam and hack, but there is not even single solution for the loss that has happened. Moreover, people lose faith and trust in the crypto space because of no guarantee that the loss of crypto can be settled. An average user using the crypto trading will not come back when they face this kind of situation.\n\nTo give solutions to all these problems, INZURA is developed and tested with the best in class protocol for insurance specially designed with cryptocurrency in mind. Inzura is the next revolutionary project in the crypto space. Inzura is an insurance token that allows users to claim their loss of cryptocurrency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.inzura.world/#/home](https://www.inzura.world/#/home)\n\n[https://www.inzura.world/static/media/Inzura%20Whitepaper%20v1.2.1.93dfbde0.pdf](https://www.inzura.world/static/media/Inzura%20Whitepaper%20v1.2.1.93dfbde0.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n bounty0x username: arifcakir13 ",

While many entrepreneurs who realized the future of block chain technology were at the beginning of the road, they started many new projects in order to benefit from the opportunities without missing the train, while companies with projects started to shift their infrastructure to block chain.\n\nOf course, the most important factor in the recognition of block chain technology is Bitcoin and other crypto coins. Bitcoin crypto money, which is the product of block chain technology, has attracted a lot of money to people in a short period of time. That's how people who started to learn Bitcoini were introduced to the block chain and gradually became aware that this was the main development.\n\nAs one of the experts in this technology and continuous research, I can tell you that there is no escape from the future. Block chain technology will mark the years ahead and will benefit from the blessings of this technology in almost every sector.\n\nThe project called \"The Collective\", which is the subject of today's project, has a infrastructure developed with a block chain and it is a platform that a team of talented entrepreneurs has presented to our liking with the purpose of supporting the other block chain projects.\n\nB.png\nThe platform gives us the first clue with its name, for the Collective project, a collective work, and the first step of an ecosystem where many block chain projects will support each other. There will be many different products for the project users in The Collective ecosystem. Now, let's take a look at these services.\n\n\u00b7 The Collective platform will be a candidate to offer your customers a professional social media management service. Today's most important publicity activities are carried out on social media, and today there is no chance of success in social media with an inadequate and amateur spirit. Therefore, getting support from a team specialized in social media is an essential issue for every project.\n\n\u00b7 Today, many block chain projects take out their own crypto money and invest in the so-called token. The community formed by these investors is looking for answers to the questions and problems of the project. The Collective platform is ready to support community management projects with its expert team.\n\n\u00b7 These projects aiming to collect investment should offer and present products and services to the market technically well so that they can win the trust of investors. The Collective platform can provide all kinds of support for the preparation of these white paper named Whitepaper.\n\nThe aim of this game will be to increase the recognition of the project and token's social media by distributing rewards to its users.\n\nNEWS & UPDATES\n\nWebsite: https://www.thecollectivegroup.org/ico/\n\nWhitepaper: https://www.thecollectivegroup.org/ico/WP_Collective.pdf\n\nBounty0x username : azisjesika",

            "text": " Since we have a long-experienced sales operator group as our core partner (NEW EMOTION INC.), we are able to cover wide range of products such as in-door health bicycle, electric bicycle, electric motorbikes, ESS sunlight panel, and even self-driving electric car (research phase for now). Also, we are able to treat various product models within each product category and we have international branches to easily expand our platform scope as well. For this reason, we are able to change the design or the specification of our CyClean products in the future to better support our users. \n\n Also, there are numerous possibilities to expand our product line itself. We simply have to augment the product with our low level chipset, wireless network, smart CyClean emission APIs, and some mechanical procedure. We believe as we expand CyClean platform, we would not have to solely depend on increasing the quantity of our product lines. We believe several competent producers will become inspired and envisioned for joining the clean cycle of CyClean. \n\n Actually, we already have some lined up for discussion for addition of models or product category to our platform. Our business model is immediately applicable to any manufacturers with good product, infrastructure, and sincere shared goal for green revolution. Of course, this will assume that our platform has already been launched on such country with legal entity. Also, because we have global market experience and competent partners, we are able to expand the physical territory of CyClean smoothly as well. Having both blockchain platform (software based) and tangible sales operation and furthermore, having combination of those two are a powerful business model. There is even more. Our core partner group is not new to blockchain business: in fact, they have the most innovative and powerful blockchain platform that has been revolutionizing South Korea for several months. Our core partner group owns a payment system platform called JPAY platform which has solved 1) fluctuating price problem, and 2) confirmation delay time of cryptocurrencies. With 2 layered coin system, JPAY platform is aggressively expanding its member stores for several months without any risks or problems. Also they are launching JPAY card which enables holders of cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, JPAY, Dash, etc to spend those assets in real time ALL across South Korea anywhere with card reader machine, without entrepreneurial risks thanks to the 2 layered system. \n\n  To learn more please visit jpayplatform.com / Whitepaper in several languages are available. Below image represents the overall structure of JPAY platform. CyClean is not just partnered but actually integrated with JPAY platform. \n\n Because we are based on Ethereum platform, there comes a lot of advantages, for example the smart contract feature and Ethereum compatible features (for future partnership, wallet compatibility, coin exchange enlisting procedure, and scanning availability). Although improving technology and innovation for blockchain technology itself is important, more imminent problem is demonstrating an operating blockchain platform to the market and its contributors. Based on our in-dept research, we believe there aren\u2019t many blockchain platforms that implemented smart contract feature in a tangible and commercial way, providing a working model for the market. We intend to be one of the model cases who has implemented blockchain technology and smart contract feature to a commercial and global level. To do so, we utilize Ethereum platform for our CyClean coin. Additionally, we would like to line out the schedules and identity of our ICO here. The schedule can be calibrated due to internal or external situations. For the most recent and accurate information, please refer to the website. \n\n As we utilize smart contract feature based on blockchian, we briefly explain here about smart contract. A smart contract is a computer algorithm designed to conclude and maintain self-executing contracts in a blockchain environment. These contracts are written in the form of code that exists in a distributed registry \u2015 a blockchain that is maintained and managed by a network of computers to exchange assets without resorting to intermediaries . Also smart contracts allow you to perform reliable and confidential transactions without the involvement of external intermediaries in front of banks or banks and government agencies. In addition, such transactions are traceable, transparent and irreversible. Smart contracts not only contain information about the obligations of the parties and sanctions for their violation, but also automatically ensure the fulfillment of all the terms of the contract. ",

            "text": "If we go back to the beginning of the Blockchain journey, we can say that it all started with the appearance of Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency on January 3, 2009. As with all innovations, the criticisms that initially this was a trap, that such a structure would not work, and how the value would be determined did not fall off the agenda. \n\nThis issue has been discussed for quite a long time, but during this time Bitcoin investors have gradually increased and increased Bitcoin's market value. This rise led to the formation of alternative cryptocurrencies, leading to the formation of the current cryptocurrency market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sg1jr75zq6431.jpg?width=2314&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=919a28726f63befd6357a0566abdc3d6b2619404\n\nHowever, in this context, we will not talk about the future of the crypto money market or what sub-coins to invest. As we mentioned in the title, our current position is the use of Blockchain technology in digital marketing, which is based on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe can define Blockchain technology as a distributed database that provides encrypted transaction tracking. As the name implies, a chained model, Blockchain technology, which is closely monitored, enables transactions to be performed independently of a center, so that transactions can be carried out directly between the buyer and the seller. This situation can be compared to sharing personal music through Napster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven some experts who suspect that Bitcoin itself today believe that blockchain technology will benefit in many areas. Blockchain technology, which is expanding its development and usage areas in digital marketing and all other mass industries with its secure infrastructure, continues to develop by changing the way many sectors work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqqr8i01r6431.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b10e4a7eb4aaf472eae79362b85fe041576e113\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is the Wibson?**\n\nWibson can be described as a blockchain-based, Decentralized, Privacy-Preserving Data Marketplace or dPDM. It is a decentralized information marketplace that is secure, reliable and transparent and allows effective and efficient movement of private information by individuals that is approved for such services and purposes.\n\nWibson Token with a Ticker known as WIB, is the traditional token of the Wibson platform. The WIB is built on Ethereum smart contract network. It is also a utility token. Since WIB utility token is built on Ethereum smart contract it will in turn help facilitate data exchange on WIBSON network/platform and also provide a great amount of data value on the network. \n\nTokens derived from these activities mentioned above will be burned, this will, in turn, reduce the amount of WIB in circulation and it will also help increase the market value of WIB due to token scarcity. Worthy of note is the fact that after Initial Coin Offering (ICO) no WIB token will ever be created, minted or mined.\n\nThe availability of the WIB will further fuel the development of the network and also provide fast, secure, transparent, efficient transactions on the Wibson platform.

If a user has sufficient funds and possesses a good track record, his or her Verto wallet can act as a node. \n\n \n\nAggregators\n\nThe VDex aggregators are dedicated Volentix servers for simulator and security purposes. One of their functions is to pull logs and order book data from nodes into sparse distributed representations for hierarchical temporal memory as intrusion \\[7\\] analysis for detecting anomalies in the system. The aggregators will also be host to other components such as metachain ledgers and blockchain scrapers\n\n### 3.1.3 Latency\n\nEOS.IO has low latency block confirmation (0.5 seconds). This degree of latency can be maintained in transactions with other blockchains if those chains admit of similar latency. But fundamentally the transaction is only as rapid as the lesser-rapid chain in the equation. It is well known, for example, that a Bitcoin block requires approximately ten minutes for processing. Receiving a transaction hash does not mean the transaction is confirmed; it means only that a node accepted the transaction without error, although there is generally a high probability other block producers will ACCEPT \u0130T.\n\nVTX Issuance and Use\n\nVTX is the native digital asset to be issued and used on the VDex decentralized exchange. We currently plan to use an eosio.token contract from the EOS.IO framework to issue 2.1 billion EOS.IO-compliant VTX tokens with a supply of 1.3 billion. VTX will have a diverse array of uses, for example:\n\nTo reward participants in the consensus process and in Venue campaigns.\n\nTo pay and redistribute transaction fees on the VDex exchange.\n\nTo submit and vote on proposals to the Volentix ecosystem, using the voting rights allocated to VTX holders.\n\nTo stake support for reviewing proposals and implementing projects.\n\nTo incentivize users to participate in order book settlement by becoming nodes via their Verto wallets.\n\nTo incentivize users to lock funds in for >24 hours by HTLC time-bound transactions\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nToken Details:\n\nSymbol: VTX  \nPlatform: EOS  \nTotal supply : 2.100.000.000  \nAccepted currency : ETH, BTC, US dollar, EOS, LTC, EUR, Dash, NEO, XRP  \nSoft cap: 3.000.000 USD  \nHard cap: 48,500,000 USD\n\nRoad Map\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nResult:\n\nI find the Volentix project very successful in terms of Project Idea, project design and project implementation. The volentix eco system is really nice to be able to solve a lot of users ' problems without needing any other platform.  \nThe dedicated work of the volentix team shows how much they care about their projects.I believe we will often hear the name of the project in future years. The ICO of the project is continuing and they reached soft cap. I'd say the most quality blockchain project I've seen recently.\n\nYou can visit the links below for detailed information:\n\nWebsite: [https://volentix.io](https://volentix.io/)\n\nWallet download: [https://volentix.io/#downloadverto](https://volentix.io/#downloadverto)\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/volentix](https://t.me/volentix)\n\nWhitepaper : [https://volentix.io/vdex-white-paper/](https://volentix.io/vdex-white-paper/)\n\nAnn thread [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5048597](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5048597)\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/volentix](https://twitter.com/volentix)\n\nFacebook : [https://www.facebook.com/Volentix/](https://www.facebook.com/Volentix/)\n\nInstagram: [https://www.instagram.com/volentix.labs](https://www.instagram.com/volentix.labs)\n\nMedium : [https://medium.com/@volentixlabs](https://medium.com/@volentixlabs)\n\nYoutube: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGjUbCE-kht1gK6y5neD1cQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGjUbCE-kht1gK6y5neD1cQ)\n\nGithub : [https://github.com/Volentix/](https://github.com/Volentix/)\n\nBounty0x: sarikaya\n\nVerto wallet: EOS5tUtKJ5dbQfffirugDKpYg5cdJq7kpLic8jMhT5Fxd9FbP4yGJ",

            "text": "**INTRODUCTION**\n\nSince Bitcoin was invented by Satoshi Nakamato, the master of cryptocurrency, there has been a considerable increase in adoption of blockchain technology, which is evident through various coins and other available subcoins.\n\nFurthermore, various projects are supported using Blockchain technology. Gaming, banking, tourism, social media and almost many industries have started to use blockchain technology to facilitate their daily activities. There are problems with the operation carried out in the ecosystem in spite of the recommendations that Blockchain technology offers to its adopters. In the block chain, we don't have to go into too much stress before the fraudulent cases are concluded, and this is largely due to the low level of security.\n\n**MEET THE COLLECTIVE**\n\n[The Collective Community](https://www.thecollectivegroup.org/ico/index.html?utm_source=bountyhive.io&utm_medium=bounty&utm_campaign=bounty&ref=bountyhive.io) is the technology company of a small island country in the UK called Guernsey in Europe and has several projects at the same time. The main objective of the project is the construction of a community that is dedicated to the technology of Blockchain, from the very beginning to the end, to follow-up, analysis and sustainability of a system dedicated to Blockchain technology, in the management and support of ICOs and market-emerging coins in the incubation period.\n\nThe Collective Exchange is another product offered by The Collective Community. The major feature of this stock market is that some of the major stock exchanges (Binance, Bittrex, Bitfinex, Poloniex) are not one of the decentralized exchanges. Justification is important because one of the most important phenomena in the emergence of Blockchain technology is decentralization, which cannot be traced in a peer-to-peer manner and cannot be pursued. The fact that Binance and other major stock exchanges do not have this important fact of the Blockchain, in contradiction to its philosophy, The Collective wishes to be a part of a large community, compatible with its philosophy, aiming to be like the other masses (Bitshare, Waves, 0x Protocol). The Decentralized stock market is much safer, independent of third-party applications and units, as it is freely constructed from the control of countries, demanding lower transaction fees, and allows you to remain more anonymous while you run your money in the market. In addition, $ 470 million of money has been stolen from crypto exchanges, and one of the main reasons for this is the control of the unregistered units by a single hand and a single heart. In this way, hackers who want to defraud the market simply take over the center and hack all the cash funds here, damaging Blockchain technology and investors.\n\nThe CDEX stock exchange is also an important step for implementing one of Blockchain's biggest philosophies. He also believes he can list his own stock exchanges without charge. As you know, exchanges like Binance demand millions of dollars to list any coin in their stock exchanges and try to use the power they have as a means of exploitation. In order to support the Blockchain community more, CDEX wants to make the project much larger and more useful by offering the project the possibilities of free listing for the coins it believes in.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nCDEX's intention is to return the list and liquidity to the hands of the community, rather than just making a decision based on their own interests. It aims to achieve this by giving loyalty rewards to the CDEX users to trade on the platform. It will provide a discounted fee structure for qualified users and will give members of the Community an opportunity to review the companies they intend to trade on the stock exchange.\n\nBounty0x username: Nuxxorcoin1",

There were two consensus applied by Veil and made into a new consensus hybrid model, namely Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. The merging of these two consensus will make the process in it take place with maximum decentralization. This concept of decentralization is very core and is directly connected with blockchain technology.

With this kind of agreement or contract, it would generally take around 48 months for investors to regain their costs while leaving the platform with 1/5th of the term of the contract to generate some profit. \nAlso, most people don\u2019t consider the fact that the network difficulty will have increased with time meaning they will probably never generate a real profit unless the price of Bitcoin increases as at when due.\n\nBut with MinedBlock solution investors aren\u2019t buying a fixed hashrate, rather they are buying a share of the whole service. This means that as MinedBlock increases the size of the operation users shares grows too. Also, MinedBlock intends to buy its tokens back over time and remove them from circulation which will also a means to increase the value of investors shares.\n\nIn the same way, MinedBlock stands out owing to the fact that its running costs will be far lower than a lot of other companies due to the geographic locations the platform have chosen to host its mining farms. Through this, MinedBlock can stay profitable even in the current bear market. MinedBlock also has some future plans to offset the electricity costs which will be revealed as the platform progresses. \n\nAnother point worth knowing about MinedBlock platform is that it will also switch to the mining of different assets when the need arises, while the service will be monitored 24/7 to ensure it is always running at high efficiency.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe MinedBlock platform will be created to stand out thus making it possible for the token holders to contribute to the success of the platform through a voting system.\nFurthermore, MinedBlock will offer the hosting of masternodes where the platform can host a node and earn transaction revenue that will also be shared between token holders.\n\nWebsite: https://www.minedblock.io/\n\nWhitepaper: https://www.minedblock.io/assets/MinedBlockWhitepaper.pdf\n\nBounty0x Username: Chuks",

Faireum is a blockchain based platform which has been designed with its own set of protocols. This decentralized platform mainly aims to solve the growing issues in the gambling industry. It offers a practical solution to each of the problems through its decentralized platform. The main aim of the platform is to reduce the costs, promote transparency, to provide secure betting and to improve the gambling experience.\n\nThis particular platform is based on the best practices of Hyperledger, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. The consensus algorithm adopted from the Byzantine fault tolerance assures the verification of transactions that are carried on the platform. It also verifies the performance as well.\n\nThe platform also has its own native currency and smart game contract which is known to provide premium betting services and experience in sports betting, casino games, lotteries and other digital games to the players. The platform is based on a set of protocols which enables the creation of borderless, trustful, fast and secure online gambling network for all.\n\nThe main aim of the platform is to enable the next generation of many-to-many betting and gambling apps while transforming the gambling industry into a decentralized platform. With the help of blockchain technology, the platform seeks to deploy their apps in a peer-to-peer environment which will provide visibility, transparency, and fairness. The platform with its features is going to change the look of the gambling industry.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nDespite the significant growth of the gambling industry, it is surrounded by several problems. This has made some of the countries reluctant about legalizing online gambling. Faireum as a decentralized platform aims to solve all these common problems so that the industry can reach greater heights. It is the benefit for all. It is because of these issues that many of the players are not even willing to try online gambling.\n\nSome of the main problems faced by the players include lack of trust, a limit on withdrawals, hidden casino charges and more. Not only that players but even the service providers are not spared from the rising issues. High entry fees, lack of transparency and credibility are some of the significant problems that are faced by the service providers.\n\nFaireum seeks to address all these problems by providing a solution in the form of a decentralized platform. The main aim of the platform is to eliminate all these problems for the benefit of all. The platform is also known to provide some benefits to the players. The platform seeks to reduce the costs, promote transparency and provide a secure betting option with the help of its decentralized platform which is developed with its own set of protocols. The platform will enable the developers to publish their Dapps. One of the main objectives of the platform is to remove the risk inherent from the current system. This will be made possible by decentralizing the gambling industry.\n\n**Games on the Faireum Platform**\n\nThe platform is also known to have a vast collection of games on its platform. Players can access thousands of great gambling games from its iGaming platform. Wild West, Emperor\u2019s Garden, and Super Dragon\u2019s Fire are some of the games that can be found on the platform. The platform will include both official and best games from their network of providers. This will include:\n\n1. Lottery\n2. Casino\n3. Digital games\n4. Sports betting\n\n## Faireum Token\n\n1.2 billion Tokens are going to be released during the main token event and presale. Each Faireum token will be mapped into a single corresponding ERC20 token on the Ethereum ecosystem as the Faireum platform is still under development. Once the Faireum ecosystem is ready, there will be three major participants in the Faireum token economics including network supporters, users, and developers.\n\nFaireum token will become the native currency on the platform in the future.\n\n [https://faireum.io/](https://faireum.io/)",

Two bilaterally operating chains will be interacting with each other through consensus nodes that will come to an agreement on whether or not the burn/mint process can be pushed while ensuring a number of factors are in line before validating it on the network. This action, called off chaining, will occur by a consumer using the \u201cspend\u201d protocol or \u201cswap\u201d protocol initiating a burn of supply, and an immediate minting of exact USDAP on the side chain. This side chain will maintain a static value based on the amount of USDAP available through the off chaining process. The circulating supply of Bitcoin Air will lower along with the available market cap, maintaining the value of each share on the volatile chain. This will allow merchants and small businesses to \u201cside chain\u201d their value if they would prefer not to fall victim to market health. \n\nfor more information, kindly check here https://bitcoinair.org",

There are few hacks that have shook the crypto market down to its very core. Even the top most exchange that handled 70% of the world\u2019s bitcoin exchanges have faced most unexpected hack. Yet the hack did not stop there, about 120,000 BTC which was worth $72 million was stolen in August 2016. The hack continued all over the world from small volume exchanges to huge volume exchanges. South Korea have faced $30 million worth of hack in cryptocurrency in 2018. Exchange in India was hacked and over 440 BTC was hacked back in early 2018.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5oh1rpgafio21.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=453c2499f5c7b7d9e06456ab426d9f48313b2835\n\nTill date many scams and hacks are ongoing. One of the biggest scam ever is BitConnect where the exact data of users and crypto invested is still unknown. Reports say over 100s of million worth Bitcoin were scammed. All in all over billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies were hacked, stolen, and scammed in this crypto space.\n\nRegulations tightens up to reduce the scam and there are few restrictions to control the scam and hack, but there is not even single solution for the loss that has happened. Moreover, people lose faith and trust in the crypto space because of no guarantee that the loss of crypto can be settled. An average user using the crypto trading will not come back when they face this kind of situation.\n\nTo give solutions to all these problems, INZURA is developed and tested with the best in class protocol for insurance specially designed with cryptocurrency in mind. Inzura is the next revolutionary project in the crypto space. Inzura is an insurance token that allows users to claim their loss of cryptocurrency.\n\n \n\n**For more details about project, you can check website and whitepaper:**\n\n* Website: [https://www.inzura.world](https://www.inzura.world/)\n* Whitepaper: [https://www.inzura.world/static/media/Inzura%20White%20Paper%20v1.0.2.56d01731.pdf](https://www.inzura.world/static/media/Inzura%20White%20Paper%20v1.0.2.56d01731.pdf)\n\nbounty0x username: sakaleyn",

We\u2019ll use Ethereum smart contracts as the example throughout this whitepaper, but Link is main-chain agnostic and is architected in a\u00a0manner that is adaptable to\u00a0the leading smart contract supporting main-chains without a\u00a0native Web API layer. Link solves some of the most persistent and pervasive problems plaguing the blockchain community: ease-of-use and accessibility. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have grown in the public consciousness, blockchain still primarily functions as a\u00a0vehicle for cryptocurrency trading and other financial application\ufffd.

In many cases buyers need to set up accounts, verify identities, deposit funds and mess around with unintuitive interfaces before they can get their hands on major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Alt-currencies require further steps. \n\nOnce you have your chosen currency, you need to decide what to do with it. Are you going to transfer it to an exchange, keep it where it is, or store it elsewhere? In any case you are going to need a wallet address specific to the individual currency, and this will be different on each platform that you use. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Our Solution \n\n Through the XCOYNZ Exchange users can purchase selected crypto directly using their debit cards or via international bank transfer (i.e. SEPA) in fiat, or convert crypto back to fiat. We will then make transferring straight to their bank, to a third-party account and even scheduling recurrent payments such as rent or mobile contracts remarkably simple through our proprietary software: X-Swift. Importantly, our platform makes crypto-to-crypto exchanges as straightforward as possible, allowing those with little to no previous experience in currency exchange engage with the platform and join the cryptosphere. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzs0h70krfx21.png?width=217&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ddd2e78a81e8c974c76934f16b4f6968397adaa\n\n What\u2019s more, with our AI-based Smart Algorithm Wallet individuals can consolidate all of their XCOYNZ approved assets in one easy-to-use wallet with a single address. From here the individual can select a default payment currency, and gain clear insight into the most profitable use of their assets and advanced HODL predictions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y0dvqg5mrfx21.png?width=211&format=png&auto=webp&s=2354180532f66e68aba32cb8042806e1dfbe68ca\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Webpage](https://www.xcoynz.com/)\n\nBounty0x ID : hllelek33",

If your objective is long-term investment then you don\u2019t have to do anything. Simply make sure the wallet is secured. If we\u2019re looking at mass adoption however, coins need to be circulated and not sequestered away. So we need to be able to spend them on goods and services, and do so easily. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Unfortunately current payment systems are unrefined and limited. With most business owners unwilling to accept straight crypto transactions due to fiat value volatility, and poor integration with current ecommerce and accounting systems, most businesses aren\u2019t going to accept crypto payments anytime soon. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nXCOYNZ Solution\n\n&#x200B;\n\n The XCOYNZ Payment Gateway bridges this gap. A key connector between buyers and sellers, our subscription service allows businesses to seamlessly accept payments for goods and services in cryptocurrencies through a simple API and by setting accepted currencies. When a buyer goes to make a purchase their Smart Algorithm Wallet login details will be requested and their default settings loaded (i.e. their preferred payment currency).

Bitcoin\u2019s peer-to-peer (p2p) technology is designed to facilitate (at least in theory) instantaneous, cheap and secure settlement of values without the intervention of any middleman (such as banks or other financial institutions).\n\nChimpion was founded with the goal which that allows any merchant in the world to accept cryptocurrency without needing advanced technical knowledge. The technology for the platform has already been developed. \n\nChimpion Core is the in-house developed proprietary system of Chimpion ecosystem. It is been currently migrating to EOS blockchain and it includes Paytomat Core in the form of an EOS smart contract and services which is responsible for merchant accounts and balances, merchant interfaces (Merchant Web Panel, Merchant App, POS integrations, and e-commerce plugins), and consumer apps (non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ABOUT THE CHIMPION TOKEN**\n\nChimpion platform is fuelled by dual token with each of them having its own use cases. The first token is Chimpion and this is the token that powers merchant storefronts and also the base currency of the platform.\n\nThe second token is the Banana token which serves as the loyalty rewards token of the ecosystem. Buyers will be able to earn it by buying from Chimpion merchants with CHIMP token or any other Cryptocurrency.\n\nBy staking CHIMP in a supported wallet or paying a monthly fee, merchants can gain access to Chimpion's sophisticated crypto e-commerce platform.\n\nNote that, CHIMP follows a proof-stake algorithm which relies on community support which is slightly different from mining.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will conclude by saying this; Chimpion offers an advanced cryptocurrency payment system with a custom e-commerce and settlement backend which you cannot just afford to miss out of.\n\nJoin us now at Chimpion!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor more information about the Chimpion project, kindly visit:\n\nWebsite: [https://www.chimpion.io/](https://www.chimpion.io/)\n\nWhitepaper: [https://www.chimpion.io/whitepaper/](https://www.chimpion.io/whitepaper/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBounty0x Username: **hiboat**",

Receive AirCash ($USDAP) in person from another person and sweep it into your wallet. USDAP will not be sendable to each person.

            "text": "When Satoshi developed Bitcoin blockchain, he conceptualized decentralization for peer-to-peer exchange of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets without involving intermediaries. This is the main vision of the progenitor of the first decentralized network. However, along the line, third parties still found their ways into the system, and now there are various intermediaries holding pivotal roles in crypto transactions. Examples include centralized exchanges, financial institution-backed payment solutions such as crypto cards, trusted parties (lawyers and co) for over-the-counter (OTC) trades, and many others. Satoshi wanted these third parties out of the equation in a bid to empower people financially.\n\nWhat paved way for third parties in crypto transactions\nBlockchain has been touted as a technology that is superior to traditional technologies in that it enables transparent, low-cost, and secure transfer of value and information. However, it compares weakly to traditional systems in terms of speed and scalability. So many blockchains have been developed (and some are still in development), but developers built these protocols to be disparate and incognizant of others. Until recently, it was impossible for a user to exchange Bitcoin for Ethereum without having to send first to centralized exchanges. So someone had to fill in the gap created by lack of interoperability among blockchains, that paved way for centralized exchanges.\n\nCentralized exchanges capitalized on this limitation, and now, they occupy a strategically key position in the industry. Satoshi wouldn't be happy wherever he is to see his ideal compromised.\n\nSo what is the solution?\n\nCross-chain solutions that enable interoperability are the answer. Blockchain Interoperability enables users to exchange value and information between different blockchains without involving an intermediary. One of such solutions is Ferrum Network.\n\nFerrum Network is a robust platform designed for high-speed low cost interoperability transactions among disparate blockchains without counterparty risks. The core technology of the infrastructure is DAG (directed acyclic graph) technology, which helps solve the issue of low transaction throughput currently plaguing existing protocols. The mechanism of interoperability is achieved in part by Fe proxy tokens which enables a user to safely import value from external networks and then safely export it back to the initial network. \n\nAs a crypto-financial network, Ferrum allows developers to build their financial applications for real-world use cases as decentralized applications (DApps) on the infrastructure. Ferrum Network is leading in this aspect by developing a chain of products on its own network such as Kudi exchange, UniFyre Wallet and others.\n\nBlockchain Interoperability solutions like Ferrum Network  edge the cryptocurrency community closer to the actualization of the original ideals of decentralization. This could be the big leap into the future.\n\nRead more on the Ferrum Network project:\n\nWebsite: https://ferrum.network\n\nAuthor's Bounty0x Username: Mexite",

The first-week box office is the peak of a movie's revenue, amounting to approximately 1/3 of the movie's total revenue, then followed by an overwhelming decline of over 60% the following week and another 40% after that. Despite a number of noteworthy revolutionary projects, some companies also have taken advantage of this hype, having created countless projects that are just plain gimmicky, outlandish and borderline useless. This chain of events eventually led to the failure of incompetent crowdfunded projects left and right, eventually leading to a drastic decline of cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts. \n\nContinue reading at:  [http://tyler-penske.people.msnbc.com/\\_news/2019/03/06/38742863-crypto-winter-the-perfect-time-for-investors](http://tyler-penske.people.msnbc.com/_news/2019/03/06/38742863-crypto-winter-the-perfect-time-for-investors)",

If we consider the features of the Catex platform, isolated from other exchanges on the market;\n\nThe Catex Stock Exchange initiated a conversion, which is returned to the user as a Catt coin with bonuses at certain rates when its users trade. Thus, 80% of the commissions apply to users who own a Catt coin, depending on what they do, or on what they hold Catt Coin. 7 - 15 - 30 and with 60-day periods, the Catt coin withholds or receives a bonus from the shares and the Catt coin from the income received on the Catex Stock Exchange.\n\nAll important decisions on the Catex Stock Exchange are made and evaluated according to comments from them, suggesting them to the existing community of users. Management Catex will be responsible only for important operations, marketing operations and some important management issues related to the platform. As can be seen, the Catex platform differs from many cryptocurrency exchanges both in management and in profit and use.\n\nOne of the most important methods of making money on the Catex stock market is the ability to make money through mining. So, how to make loot and what bets can I get? Mining has certain criteria. The most important thing is the speed of extraction. Mining speed is a value determined by the platform for physical control of the cost of production. This is a level of complexity that is similar to the complexity of inter-block digging, which we know from other coins that have been mined and is being rebuilt every day to maintain the stability of the miners' earnings.

By providing high rates of return for those staking our token, as well as other trusted tokens that we partner with, Kounotori aims to set a new standard for staking stability and returns on the Ethereum network.\n\nOur token, $KTO, is built on the Ethereum block chain (ERC-20) with a number of anti-manipulation features built into its contract, including max buy/sell in any single transaction, a max hold per wallet, and bot/sniper blacklisting on launch.\n\nOther features include:\n\n1. **Sliding Tax Scale \ud83d\udcca**  \nOur token has the power to adjust reflections to holders or to the treasury depending on market conditions.\n2. **ETH Marketing Wallet \ud83d\udc8e**  \nNo more price drops should we need to pay for marketing. We also have the power to buy back tokens to benefit our project.\n3. **Incredible Reflections \ud83d\udcb5**  \nAnything up to 9% reflections to holders, with the minimum received being 3%.\n\n# Tokenomics:\n\n**Total supply of 1 Quadrillion (1,000,000,000,000,000) $KTO**\n\n**To prevent early whale manipulation we will be using the following restrictions at launch:**\n\n1. Maximum transaction at launch: 0.2%of total supply.  \nThis will remain in place until further notice.\n2. Maximum held per wallet at launch: 0.5%of total supply value.  \nUpon reaching a total market cap of $50,000,000 ($50m) the maximum held per wallet will increase to 1% of total supply value.\n\n**9.5% (95,000,000,000,000 $KTO) of the total supply will be allocated to a team wallet and will be released over a period of 12 months, starting 1 month after launch.**  \nAllocation breakdown:  \n4 Core Team Developers - 6% of the total supply (60,000,000,000,000 $KTO)  \n7 Core Moderators/Advisors - 3.5% of the total supply (35,000,000,000,000 $KTO)\n\n**40% (400,000,000,000,000 $KTO) of the total supply is to be burned at launch, to a dead wallet.**\n\n**50.5% (505,000,000,000,000 $KTO) of the total supply will be used to provide liquidity on Uniswap to kickstart the launch.**\n\n# Useful info:\n\n1. Team is aiming to offer similar returns to PCS, or higher. They will offer variable staking periods, both locked and non locked terms. Locked terms offering higher rewards, of course.\n2. Constant 10% tax on buys and sells  \nTax will remain 10% but we will shift it from 7% marketing reflections in eth and 3% holder reflections in native token to being more in favour of holder reflections over time. Team will eventually reach 9% holder reflections and 1% marketing reflections in eth.\n3. Team has a max wallet of 0.5% total supply (5T tokens) and that will remain so until they reach 50m market cap at which point we will increase it to 1% total supply (10T tokens). This cannot be bypassed by transfers etc. Leaving the 1% wallet limit in place permanently or until a top 3 CEX demands to remove it before we list there.\n4. Max transaction limit of 0.2% (2T tokens) and this will remain in power, again, indefinitely or until a top 3 CEX demands to remove it.\n5. Team doesn't have the ability to blacklist wallets manually so you dont have to worry about that\n6. Team doesn't have the ability to set max transaction to 0. Their code will not accept any value lower than 0.1% (1T) tokens max transaction. If they try to set to anything below that, it will just refuse the value.\n7. They have the ability to whitelist CEX wallets from wallet/transaction limits. They already had to do this for Unicrypt wallet to allow them to lock team tokens in there.\n8. The returns on staking platform will be paid in a second token which will be mintable\n9. being aware of the fact that gas fees are a big problem when it comes to Ethereum chain staking so team is looking into ways of making this less of an issue on the platform. Cant really comment on the way this will be achieved as it is still theoretical ATM but team members have consulted a few people and it seems like it will be completely doable.\n\n# Useful links:\n\nWebsite: [https://www.kounotoritoken.com/](https://www.kounotoritoken.com/)\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/kounotoritoken](https://t.me/kounotoritoken)\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/kounotoritoken](https://twitter.com/kounotoritoken)\n\nLitepaper: [https://3f9ed746-aeb4-4b07-88cb-8c24f2814648.filesusr.com/ugd/d8dfea\\_807cbf00b13740759a4df49bb608e02b.pdf](https://3f9ed746-aeb4-4b07-88cb-8c24f2814648.filesusr.com/ugd/d8dfea_807cbf00b13740759a4df49bb608e02b.pdf)\n\nTeam faces: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veNZNbdI2LQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veNZNbdI2LQ)\n\nLP lock: [https://app.unicrypt.network/amm/uni-v2/pair/0x20893b642b56fa81131a8fb1d6489e82de5a7449](https://app.unicrypt.network/amm/uni-v2/pair/0x20893b642b56fa81131a8fb1d6489e82de5a7449)\n\nTeam token lock: [https://app.unicrypt.network/amm/uni-v2/token/0x616ef40d55c0d2c506f4d6873bda8090b79bf8fc](https://app.unicrypt.network/amm/uni-v2/token/0x616ef40d55c0d2c506f4d6873bda8090b79bf8fc)",

Every transaction can only be made fairly for all parties involved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBuyBack & BURN \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udcc8\n\nA feature made to drive the price up.

These tokens will be burned therefore removing them from circulation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRebase \ud83d\udcc8\n\nRebase is an effective burn strategy where we can reduce the supply of the token to increase the price. This allows us to create a healthy, EverGaining chart which attracts new investors allowing us to reach bigger milestones in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTokenomics \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3% - BNB Rewards\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2% - Buy Back & Burn \ud83d\udd25 \n\n2% - Liquidity\n\n2% - Marketing\n\n1% - Development\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLinks & Social-Media \ud83d\udc6a\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/EverGainBSC](https://t.me/EverGainBSC)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [https://evergainbsc.com](https://evergainbsc.com)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/evergainbsc](https://twitter.com/evergainbsc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstagram: [https://www.instagram.com/evergainbsc/](https://www.instagram.com/evergainbsc/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/EverGainBSC/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EverGainBSC/)",

Simply put, the tokenomics are:\n\n\ud83d\udc8e**Buy tax:**\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tax is the same no matter the time (5%):\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\- 5% to the house wallet\n\n\ud83d\udc8e**Sell tax:**\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If selling within 7 days (30%):\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\- 5% sent to the house wallet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\- 25% sent to the burn wallet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If selling within 7-14 days (20%):\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\- 5% sent to the house wallet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\- 15% sent to the burn wallet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If selling within 14-21 days (10%):\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\- 5% sent to the house wallet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\- 5% sent the burn wallet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If selling after 21 days (5%):\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\- 5% sent to the house wallet\n\nTLDR; diamond hands are rewarded, paper hands are burned.\n\n**Marketing plans?**\n\nThrough the success of crypto, the team have a very healthy marketing budget with plans for banner advertisements (Poocoin, Dextools, BscScan etc), trending across platforms, direct Chinese marketing (Weibo, Blockcast, BTOK), influencers, global billboards, AMAs, giveaways, lotteries and much, much more.   \nAlso, being on Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum gives our hodlers the best of both worlds meaning our audience isn't limited in any way.\n\n**What are the project aims?**\n\nWe are embarking on a journey to be the biggest ever project on BSC and ETH. Our aim is to firmly eclipse SafeMoon for the highest ever marketcap across the two biggest blockchains and dominate crypto with tokenomics that reward people for staying loyal.\n\n**How else are diamond hands rewarded?**\n\nThere will be 2 monthly lotteries, one for any holder to participate and another solely for diamond hands. The diamond hand lottery will have approximately 4x the available winnings and also a much higher chance of winning at that. The total of both the lotteries equates to approximately 0.5% of the total montly volume. If we reach the heights we intend, this could net jackpots in the hundreds of thousands every month.\n\nOn top of this, new smart contracts to extend the \"Q\" functionality and reward diamond hands are being developed as we speak.\u00a0\n\n**Is my investment safe?**\n\nYes. Here's why:\n\n\\- No tokens held outside of presale by devs or anyone else\n\n\\- Liquidity is locked\n\n\\- The contract is safe and audited by a reputable auditor (https://solidity.finance/audits/DiamondQ/)\n\n\\- The team are performing KYC through PinkSale\n\n**So, what now?**\n\nCheck us out on the links below:\n\n\ud83d\udc8eTelegram: https://t.me/RealDiamondQ\n\n\ud83d\udc8eWebsite: https://diamondq.org\n\n\ud83d\udc8eWhitepaper: https://diamondq.org/whitepaper.pdf\n\n\ud83d\udc8eAudit: https://solidity.finance/audits/DiamondQ/\n\n\ud83d\udc8eTwitter: https://twitter.com/RealDiamondQ\n\n\ud83d\udc8eInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/realdiamondq/\n\nAnd join us at launch or presale:\n\n**Presale: 12th December 2021, 16:00 UTC**\u00a0\n\n**Launch: 13th December 2021, 16:00 UTC**\n\nAnd remember, \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c are rewarded and paper hands are \ud83d\udd25",

This means the possibility of manual compounding of rewards multiple times per day is achievable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWolves of Wall Street have also stated they are providing 1 Matic to at least the first 500 migrators, which will automatically appear in their wallet upon migration success. This will save investors having to source Matic themselves to fuel Polygon transactions.\n\n$WOWS is looking like a multichain protocol with some very exciting launches coming up. The next announcement we believe will be Project Skyscraper, hinted at as their GameFi NFTverse and the  Polygon team have commented very favourably on the upcoming Project Skyscraper vision. \n\nWOWS - Wolves of Wall Street is a GameFi platform utilising NFTs & SFTs to visualise and gamify the DeFi space on the Ethereum chain.

            "text": "Cloud services have experienced growth over the past decade with industry behemoths such as Amazon, Google and Dropbox taking the lead. The industry has seen an annual growth of 19% and is expected to be worth in excess of $162 billion by 2020. Despite the fast-paced growth, the industry faces various challenges with concerns on privacy and security top of the list. The huge expenses associated with setting up additional data centers and infrastructure coupled with size limitations on the users are also biting problems in the industry.\n\n\nGasfiles is soon set to overcome these challenges by deploying a decentralized file system backed up by the Ethereum-based blockchain network. The storage network uses IPFS(Interplanetary file system) to safely secure encrypted files uploaded to the platform.\n\n\n**Key features that differentiate Gasfiles from other cloud storage platforms include:**\n\n**Added security** - Traditionally, cloud storage has largely depended on setting up and maintenance of huge data centers. All information are mostly kept in one place raising the possibility of a physical breach and loss of data The Gasfiles is decentralized which eliminates the possibility of massive loss of data from a breach in one data center. The blockchain-based system also ensures that uploaded files cannot be manipulated making the system suitable for copyrighted content and important organizational files.\n\n**Increased scalability** - The number of devices in our possession keeps increasing which has the possible effect of increasing the number of nodes on the network. With this in mind, Gasfiles becomes fully scalable with minimum additional investment on huge data centers. In principle, users on Gasfiles enjoy unlimited storage and are not bound by limits often placed on cloud storage solutions.\n\n**Resilience** - Gasfiles has been built with a focus on the full availability of a user's data A huge number of nodes on the network ensure users can access their data at any time\n\n**How it works?**\n\nUsers on the platform will have to first sign up with a secure identifier, just like one would do on blockchain.com. Signing in gives you access to a private blockchain where one can select multiple files for upload.\n\n\nFiles on the network do not get uploaded. Instead, they are converted into a line of code, encrypted and stored on the blockchain. These encrypted shards(32mb file segments) can then be rejoined and made available for download upon request. To retrieve data, an address is fetched from the Blockchain and a query sent to the IPFS for the associated file. This is considered a GASFiles token transaction.\n\nUsers can share files on the platform by simply adding other users or making a particular file public. \n\n**Token Sale Details**\n\n\nThe gasfiles tokens are ERC20 tokens hosted on the Ethereum blockchain. Proceeds from the sale will go towards funding the full development and adoption of the gasfiles platform. These tokens are commonly referred to as GAS.\n\nA total of 100,000,000 GAS are in supply with a sales supply of 60,000,000 GAS. Each GAS goes for 0.0003 ETH which is equivalent to $0.18 at the time of publishing this article. A 10% bonus is available until 2nd march with all GAS set to be disbursed once the token sale ends.\n\n\nThe sale will end on the 9th March 2018 or when the company reaches a hard cap of 10,000 ETH, whichever comes first. The soft cap is set at 1000 ETH.\n\n\nIn the sale, 70% of the tokens will go towards development, 10% towards general administration and 10% to the expansion of the platform. The remaining 10% will help set up physical offices.\n\n**The Team**\n\n**James Vi**, founded Gasfiles with eyes set on an innovative blockchain-based storage platform. He is an experienced Communication manager and a cryptocurrency enthusiast.\n\n**Deepak Chauhan**, the CTO, is a marketing consultant and a developer with over a decade of experience setting up and expanding startups and online businesses.\nKyle Ehli is the current sales promoter He has experience running startups and has successfully raised over $150,000 in past Initial Coin offerings(IC0s) and crypto-startups.\n\nOther core members of the team include Shajid Mahmood(Public relations) who previously worked as Assistant to Kepler's CEO Giorgi Topuria. Advisors on the team include Filip Poutintsev, Adrian Sernero, and Danish Zafar, who doubles up as the CEO, Right foot consultants.\n\nIn conclusion, Gasfiles is here to provide more space, more security and more resilience to cloud data storage.\n\nWebsite: https://www.gasfiles.com\n",

            "text": " \n\nVaultDefi V2 2022 is here!\n\n**VaultDeFi** started off 2022 on a high with the release of its V2 contract merging Safevault and Ethvault into a single token Vault-s. VaultDefi is a unique multi token project with flexible and interchangeable commodities. These assets have been uniquely designed to reward holders with proprietary double compounding interest, highlighted with our innovative \u201cdelete bag\u201d function that burns a percentage of the current supply with all transactions creating a direct benefit to the current market supply developing a larger market share for all investors. Having hyper-deflationary rewarding assets is revolutionary in the DeFi space and will be beneficial to all investors.\n\n**Backstory**\n\nThe first token Safevault, was launched in July 2021, a hyperdeflationary token rewarding holder's in safemoon. A partnership with Surge which will help VaultDefi build a multi token ecosysyem saw the reward switched to BUSD less than a month later.\n\n**Ethvault**, the second Vault token was launched in August 2021 with similar tokenomics structure, a buy tax of 5% and a 30% on sells. Ethvault was geared to be the second \\`HODL' token due to its unique ability in creating double compounding interest rewards of a surge wrapped Ethereum SETH while also rewarding holder's in Safevault, the first of vault tokens.\n\nIn October, the third token VaultBTC (Vault) was launched. VaultBTC has a similar tax structure like the first two, it is also hyperdeflationary as every buy and sell carries out a buy and burn of the first two tokens alongside rewarding holder's in SurgeBTC. VaultBTC maximizes VaultDeFi\u2019s distinctive reflections system that allows investors to diversify their portfolio by giving investors full access to the surge ecosystem. This simply means that a VaultBTC holder has the opportunity to choose to receive dividends in any one of the Surge tokens. Why We Reward in Surge Assets. I am going to try to explain this as simply as humanly possible because it is insane. How the price of our surge dividend always goes up in a nutshell: New Surge asset is minted with every buy to increase total supply and these surge assets are completely destroyed for every sell to reduce the total supply. Every transaction whether it\u2019s a buy or a sell is taxed and use to raise the BNB value of of the Surge asset being transacted which is why it only goes up in value unless of course the underlying asset drops in value.\n\n**Why I Think VaultDefi has created the next 100x tokens**\n\nDeFi is not only experimental, unpredictable, and quick to change course without warning, it's a very untamable beast at times. It's all about evolution\u2026 and here we are. On January 1, 2022 VaultDeFi merged their first two token releases and created one... Vault-s. The migration itself requires that our investors only need add the new contract address to their wallet as the new token was seamlessly airdropped to all the holders and In just a few days, the amalgamation has proven to be a great success with the new tokenomics.Secondly, a rework of the 3rd VaultDeFi release was tweaked and fine tuned and available the same day.\n\n**Vault-X What has Changed**?\n\nDeveloper and CEO of VaultDeFi Jennifer Vardon has decided that her vision for Vault includes a more approachable and healthy way of trading. The fee structure was reworked to a 3% Buy Tax and 8% Sell. Each with their own unique perks as Vault-s now rewards in BNB while also self reflecting while Vault-X traditionally rewards holders in Xusd, an appreciating stable coin and at the same time retaining the ability to allow holders switch dividend between Surge assets as well as buying and burning Vault-S.\n\nWe are currently relisted on CMC and CG with integration onto platforms for cross chain interaction with many different blockchains incoming. This will not remain a BSC exclusive venture for long ... Personally I'm a trader that enjoys doing his own DD so I will let you all enjoy the same. Happy to answer any questions here but I recommend coming to visit us on our Discord server for some more info. We have a very helpful and caring community full of perks and surprises that I'll choose to not mention to preserve the fun. This isn't a solicitated offer to just come and buy.

            "text": " Many individuals believe that, because to the nature of both industries, blockchain and sex go hand in hand. Consider the following: anonymity, security, and creativity. Not to mention the very extractive media corporations that wield an iron hand over the sector. In general, there are two categories: services (escorts, entertainment, and clubs, for example) and merchandise (porn, sex technology, toys, etc.). Both have distinct issues as well as the possibility for innovation. The sex business is believed to be worth more than $300 billion. Porn is rife with intermediaries that charge exorbitant fees, up to 90% in certain circumstances. The industry benchmark is 50% for live concerts and 20\u201330% for content networks. The majority of pornographic websites are owned by a limited number of corporations.\n\nThis has resulted in the establishment of alternate ways for adult content creation, such as OnlyFans, in order to maintain fairness. Although OnlyFans has performed well, it is built on a centralized platform whose regulations are subject to change. In a variety of ways, blockchain technology contributes to the resolution of difficulties confronting the porn business. From privacy payments to a decentralized NFT marketplace, there is something for everyone. Let us now focus on the most important application cases.  \nThe Devs in the adult sector discussed all of the issues and chose to adapt to the challenges. Nafty, a pioneer in the decentralized adult system, aims to create a new game centered on the client's engagement with his model/girl/daughter... You may call it whatever you like. It is based on the 6969 NFT, which will be distributed via the Nafty token holders. They enable you to engage in adult activities such as filming, webcam, strip clubbing, and others. You appear to be acquiring VIP access to their community club. The game will be published on the Ethereum blockchain, and users who possess NFTs will be able to earn even while asleep. I'm not sure about the release date, but it appears that this game will be really popular.",

Link facilitates a\u00a0smooth user experience by handling everything that \ntraditional application users don\u2019t care about, including Ethereum wallet creation, gas calculation, and \ncommunicating directly with the Ethereum Network.\n\nLink creates a\u00a0classic, conventional web API interface for any smart contract, making the benefits of \nblockchain programming available to\u00a0developers without any blockchain experience. Even more exciting, Link \nenables hybrid applications that utilize the power of the Ethereum network for certain tasks, while employing \nalternative networks or cloud services for others, including the user interface. Additionally, Link opens an\u00a0entirely \nnew population of prospective users and clients to\u00a0the growing world of decentralized applications, finally making it \npossible for blockchain technology to\u00a0expand beyond the pool of early adopters.",

It is well know that terms like \u201cblockchain\u201d and \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d are scary these days, especially with the constant news coverage of the good, the bad, and especially the ugly that can surround them. One thing that makes Leap With Alice stand out in this cyber realm is the working prototype behind it. The engagement that is seen in students, paired with the financial incentive for teachers, makes Leap With Alice an asset in any classroom.\n\nThe security aspect of blockchain technology will ensure that student-teacher information is private and protected. While this is a very important aspect of what Leap With Alice is, the part that pays teachers for their work is even more exciting.\n\nUsing ALICE Tokens and the marketplace, teachers will be able to buy and sell unique Augmented Reality (AR) lessons. This is a borderless system; a teacher in London can create a lesson on the solar system that can be purchased and used by a teacher in Denver. Due to the technologies behind blockchain and cryptocurrencies, these teachers can painlessly transfer ALICE Tokens back and forth while also ensuring the security and authenticity of their works. Meaning they get paid for what they built, while also contributing to the global education market.\n\nLeap With Alice is powered by the technology of\u00a0Ethereum\u00a0paired with\u00a0IPFS. The Leap With Alice application will be free for teachers and students to download and use.\n\nThe best part is the Leap With Alice Fund. Every transaction that happens on the Leap With Alice platform pays a percentage forward to specified charities and funds. This means when a teacher builds and sells their lesson,\u00a020%\u00a0of the income potentially goes back into their school\u2019s community.\n\n# #Sponsored \n# #LeapWithAlice\n# #LWA\n\n# More Info: https://leapwithalice.io\n# Author's Details\n# Bounty0X Username: capableuwa",

            "text": "[**Gemstra**](https://gemstra.com/) **Solution and Ecosystem**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThere are four main actors in the social sales industry: customers,  social vendors, brands and retailers. Here, confusion may be the  difference between brands and retailers. Think of it as Nike is a brand.  On the other hand, Footlocker or Champ is the supplier of Nike  products, retailer. Nike, however, can also act as a retailer by  performing the work of Footlocker or champ himself as a brand. For  example, I'm a social salesman. I'm going to sell on social media, but  where do I get the products? I'm going to have to buy the products from  companies or initiatives that work together with the brands, which I  refer to as retailers. When we form a hierarchy about the sales process,  the top brand will be under it, the retailers, and the social vendors  will be under it.\n\nAll transactions in the gemstra ecosystem will be carried out with  smart contracts as an advantage of the Ethereum infrastructure. In  addition, all activities will be on the Astra platform. In this  platform, special wallet accounts will be determined for all actors of  the process. Each brand will identify the level of commission between  each retailer in which the sales partnership is established. Brands can  also determine the proportion of the social sellers who will sell their  products.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSocial sellers subscribe to their account as a social seller if they  want to work with any retailers. Unlike the classical system here, the  social seller does not have to work with a single retailer. It can work  with as many retailers or brands as it wants. In addition, social  seller's customer data is only found in itself, they do not have to  share it with brands or retailers. Therefore, in the solution offered by  gemstra, sellers will be able to move more freely.\n\nRetailers serve as a commercial bridge between social vendors and  brands. retailers can use the BOUTIQUES software on the Astra platform  to move their infrastructure to the platform, as well as integrate it  with the ASTRA platform through smart contracts if they already have a  functioning system.\n\nBrand owners and vendors who are members of the Gemstra platform will pay a monthly subscription fee to the platform.\n\nWithin the platform, it is also aimed to create rewarding mechanisms  with GMS tokens. For example, 100 GMS token awards will be given to the  dealer, buyers and brands who are the first members of Astra platform.  In addition, in the platform's award-winning system, retailers and  brands can target social vendors, and those who achieve these goals will  be automatically rewarded with the GMS token in predetermined amounts  through smart contracts.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nFirst of all, the project carries social sales activities that are  circulated by billions of dollars on blockchain technology and supports  all activities with tokens is a very practical concrete process. The  fact that the project already has a platform that works for nearly a  year in the current situation is a reassuring factor in the name of the  project. The fact that the project team has participated in various  blockchain symposia globally can be stated as a concrete indicator that  the team members will do this with determination in the future.  \n\n\nWebsite: [https://gemstra.com](https://gemstra.com/)\n\nWhitepaper: [https://docsend.com/view/xvyqq7a](https://docsend.com/view/xvyqq7a)\n\nReddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Gemstra/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gemstra/)\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/gemstraofficial](https://twitter.com/gemstraofficial)\n\nMedium: [https://medium.com/gemstra](https://medium.com/gemstra)  \n\n\nBounty0x username: Nuxxorcoin1",

Members are encouraged to hold $PASV through distribution of interest payments on community investments, and redistribution of all token sales.\n\nMulti-Signature Mechanism\n\nThe contracts deployed to facilitate Passive Token will be secured by a multi-signature protocol that requires multiple developer and founder wallets to approve any changes made to the protocol. In the future this functionality will be adopted for community consensus to make changes rather than solely the development and founding team.\n\nChanges made to any contracts ahead of the aforementioned governance by token holders will be run by the community for any concerns or comments. There are currently no plans to modify the contracts after launch, only extend them to use more platform applications that are currently under development.

They reached their Pre-Sale cap of 25K Ether in eight hours from 153 different participants. \n\nThe Real Estate Asset Ledger (REAL) team aims to disrupt the world of real estate by applying blockchain technology to an industry that is historically inefficient and illiquid. REAL uses Ethereum smart-contract governance to provide the best ecosystem for real estate investment. \n\nThey aim to eliminate intermediaries, improve transparency and liquidity, lower barriers to entry, and alleviate tax issues associated with cross-border transactions. REAL aims to generate rental income and value appreciation through worldwide real estate investment. By bringing together property owners and potential investors, the REAL platform will reduce friction in the real estate investment process. \n\nAny amount of money can be contributed towards a real estate property. Anyone can exchange REAL tokens for economic rights to some piece of property (these economic rights are referred to as REAL Property Participation \u2014 RPP). Profits are paid back in Ether, and users can even trade/sell rights to those investments (RPPs) on the platform. Both a website and mobile application will be the home to view and invest in any property made available by the REAL team. It is important to note that the REAL platform will take a 10% fee of all profits. If a property earns 1,000 Ether in rental income, the REAL platform will take 10% as commission for finding and hosting the property on their website. \nToken Sale is Live And rise over 31k ETH and 20% bonus now.\nSo I think I would put some on this ICO and real estate as well.\nYes!

Monetary transactions and banking will no longer be conducted by centralized banks and their servers, but rather on blockchains accessible via DeFi protocols.\n\nHowever, current difficulties of the DeFi market are that it is very complex to non-crypto affine users to use Dapps and take loans or to allocate funds to all the different platforms in order to earn interest.\n\n*If you're reading this, you're undoubtedly a crypto and DeFi early adopter, and you've been accessing various DeFi protocols through their Dapps and connecting your wallet to those URLs in your browser. However, not everyone is in the same situation, and some people may and do find the Defi area to be a difficult minefield. This can sometimes lead to people losing funds and then in turn becoming switched off to Defi and the crypto space.*\n\n**Liquidus will be the first native app for iOS and Android that provides a secure and easy-to-use wallet with access to all major projects cross-chain.**\n\nThe goal is to create a one-stop shop for customers to access all of the main DeFi projects.\n\n1. Make trades with our integrated swap functionality, which includes automated cross-chain support. For example, you may exchange your **Ethereum ETH** for **CAKE** on the Binance Smart Chain.\n2. Access your liquidity pools & farms with one click. With Liquidus you can create new liquidity pools or deposit LP tokens to a farm with one single click. Imagine having one app that integrates all major DEXes like **PancakeSwap, ApeSwap, QuickSwap, SushiSwap, UniSwap,** etc\n3. Don\u2019t worry about the safety of your funds. With Liquidus all transactions made are protected by an insurance provider.\n\nThese are just the core features of the **Liquidus** **DAPP**.\n\n**IMPORTANT $LIQ DATES\ud83d\uddd3 PUBLIC PRE-SALE - AUGUST 14th 2021**\n\n\u26aa\ufe0f *Save your Whitelist Spot*\n\n\ud83d\udcdc5% Token Allocation\n\n\ud83d\udcb5 Price is 1 BNB = 3333.33 LIQ (approx. $0.10 per token)\n\n\u26d3 Launch on BSC\n\n\ud83d\uddd3 STRATEGIC SALE - 3 Rounds\n\n\ud83d\udcdc23% Token Allocation\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Token Price will be higher each round\n\n\ud83d\udca5 ICO (final round) hosted on a DEX October 2nd 2021\n\n\ud83e\udd5e Token Launch on PancakeSwap\n\n**Liquidus TOKENOMICS**\n\nTotal Supply: 100,000,000\n\n\u2022 Presale (5%)\n\n\u2022 Private Sale (2%)\n\n\u2022 Strategic Sale - 3 rounds (23%)\n\n\u2022 Initial Liquidity (5%)\n\n\u2022 Team (16%) LOCKED\n\n\u2022 Advisors & Marketing (7%) LOCKED\n\n\u2022 Developer Fund (7%) LOCKED\n\n\u2022 Liquidity Mining (18%) LOCKED\n\n\u2022 Airdrops (2%) LOCKED\n\n\u2022 Cross Chain Liquidity (15%) LOCKED\n\n**Homepage:** [https://liquidus.finance](https://liquidus.finance/)\n\n**Twitter**: [https://twitter.com/LiquidusFinance](https://twitter.com/LiquidusFinance)",

This is why it is crucial for smart contract platforms to attract developers and on FLETA\u2019s platform great incentives are provided to developers and users alike. With FLETA, developers also have more flexibility and ease of development as multiple programming languages are supported to include, Solidity, JavaScript, and Golang (with more supported languages to be added).\n\nInstead of overburdening users with GAS, and requiring developers to pay high up-front fees with staked tokens, FLETA provides an alternative solution that is reasonable, affordable, and developer friendly.\n\nIn FLETA, developers can choose whether or not to utilize FLETA\u2019s technology support services, and if they do choose to use the services, costs are only incurred based on usage.\n\nFLETA will offer a Technology & Business Support Service to all developers within the FLETA ecosystem to allow them to develop their own DApps and run their operations smoothly.\n\nFurther services provided by FLETA for DApp developers are available if they wish to engage in such services. In these cases, reasonable costs are charged that are proportioned to the usage of the service (more details provided below).\n\nDApps Operate Their Own Independent Chain:\n\nEach independent chain in FLETA\u2019s multi-chain structure represents a DApp that has its own native token that provides utility to users and also rewards miners.\n\nEach independent chain that is led by the \u201cDApp manager\u201d can create their own token economies by choosing how the chain is governed in terms of its mining algorithm, transaction fees (they can choose none at all), and block reward model for miners.\n\nComing back to the notion of flexibility and choice, developers have a great deal of it when they choose to launch their DApps on FLETA\u2019s platform.\n\nInterchain Connection Service: If developers seek to connect their DApp to other DApps on FLETA\u2019s platform, an interchain connection service is available for doing so.\n\nFees for this service are very reasonable and vary based on the frequency of usage. The fee is a monthly payment and can be paid only using FLETA tokens. If there is no requirement to connect with other sub chains in FLETA\u2019s network, this cost is not passed on.\n\nDevelopment Support and Automation of Operation Service: A nominal fee for technological services paid for in FLETA tokens will also provide developers with on-going support through the creation of an optimal development environment.\n\nTo summarize, FLETA provides developers a platform which is more flexible and affordable than Ethereum and EOS. The formulator generator service ensures developers aren\u2019t required to pay astronomical gas or staking fees if they do not wish to. On top of this, developers also have the option to choose whether or not to utilize FLETA\u2019s additional services, and if they do, they are only charged based on usage at reasonable rates. By empowering developers, FLETA provides great incentives for more decentralized applications to be built on top of our platform.\n\nThe details about specific fee amounts are being finalized and will be released to the public upon the launching of the mainnet.\n\nWeb: https://fleta.io\n\nBtt:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1022086",

This hand over included 850 meters (2788 feet) of the Paso Yobai gold trend that is defined by an 8,000-meter-long by 300-meter-wide (26246 feet x 984 feet) gold soil anomaly. The 850 meters by 300-meter area contains an average of 7.5 g/t of gold.\nThe locals formed the, Asociaci\u00f3n de Peque\u00f1os Mineros (Small Miners Association). The problem was that they had little to no experience in mining. Using makeshift Gold Recovery Plants, they only recovered about 30% of the gold.\n\nSolution\n\nORET put together a great Team and formed a company, Paraguay Mineral Mining SA \u2013 (PMMSA). The team, among others, includes 2 people that have the knowledge needed to extract and recover the gold. The CEO, Nicolaas Spangenberg, a South African, is a Gold Mine Manager with more than 8 years of experience. For more details about our Team Member, please read Board of Directors. Juan Villalba is specialized in the extraction and chemical recover of gold with 9 years of experience.\n\nAll the gold extracted by the company each week is sold in US dollars.\n\n\u2022 All expenses and taxes are paid.\n\n\u2022 The company converts 45% of the weekly Net Profits in Cryptocurrencies (Ethereum) for\ndistribution among all ORET tokens holders.\n\n\u2022 In order for ORET Token holders to receive their profits, their ORETs must be stored in an\nERC-20 compatible wallet that they have the private key to. Examples, (myetherwallet,\nmetamask, etc.)\n\n\u2022 Holders will not receive payments for ORET Tokens that are on the exchange at the\nmoment of the Weekly Snapshot.\n\n\u2022 Ethereum deposits will be made weekly to all ORET Token holders.\n\n\u2022 For the first year, 45% of the Net Profit of PMMSA will be distributed in Ethereum to all\nORET Token holders.\n\nFind out more details about the project on the official project resource materials on:\n\nhttps://www.oretoken.net/\n\nhttps://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/7f4e8b_6ec2b5ace2a6498b8dfd9052b64d15ec.pdf",

            "text": " [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moontrust/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moontrust/)\n\nMoonTrust recently released their app, which is basically a crypto token payments platform with friends list, private chat, and group chat features like Telegram/Discord.\n\nyoutube video: [https://youtu.be/Od5naDvMNZE](https://youtu.be/Od5naDvMNZE)\n\n**What is MoonTrust?**\n\nJust this year alone, tens of thousands of tokens were created. Most of these token communities were built through Telegram and Discord. Often when new potential investors join these communities, they are misled by the information within the chat channels. This is done by employing bots to hype the project and create traction. Some also employ real humans as moderators who do not even own the token. MoonTrust is a platform to enhance the community by making sure everyone is fully transparent with each other.\n\n**MoonTrust Group Chat Feature**\n\nIn [MoonTrust](https://moontrust.net/) only token holders are allowed to chat, and it will show the actual holding amount at the time of the message. Users are also able to create custom chat channels with customizable token holding requirements. This will help community managers manage their \u201cdolphin\u201d and \u201cwhale\u201d holders. MoonTrust system will automatically remove holders who no longer meet the token requirements.\n\n**MoonTrust Payments and Friends**\n\nMoonTrust also supports payments between friends. When transferring tokens between friends, you no longer need to remember their public address. Simply find your friend using their unique username and send or request as you would just like Venmo. Final confirmation is done via your software wallet. MoonTrust also supports private messaging between friends. Users can also find common tokens held between each other. This allows users to find new friends who have similar token interests.\n\n**MoonTrust Privacy**\n\nAlthough MoonTrust offers multiple privacy options for its users, they do not have privacy options for group chat transparency. Group chats are meant to be public and to prevent manipulation. Anyone who chats in group chats will have their token holding value displayed (only for that specific group chat).\n\n**How Can MoonTrust Benefit Token** **Holders?**\n\nMoonTrust group chat system is a heavily needed system in a space where there are tons of rug pulls making headlines every week. Scammers like to airdrop phishing/scam tokens to random address, but with MoonTrust, the community can warn each other in the specific token group chats. Projects that create fake hype by employing influencers, shillers, or bots, will also be exposed with this chat system. Currently, it is also common that communities are managed by mods who do not own tokens in various Telegram and Discord project groups. These mod services are typically paid in stablecoins, ETH, BNB or BTC, but never the specific project token. In MoonTrust, these types of situations will not happen as holders' token value is displayed and only holders can moderate each other. Any bots or scam offenders banned in MoonTrust will have a direct cost of business to scam groups via gas fees of specific blockchains. Currently banning scammers or bots in Telegram or Discord is free. Malicious actors can easily create thousands of accounts. However, in MoonTrust users can only enter a chat group if they have the tokens. This means for every new account, malicious groups need to send tokens to that address, thus costing them money. MoonTrust is dubbing this \u201cProof of Gas\u201d mechanism. Just imagine the cost of business for these scam groups when using MoonTrust for the ETH chain.\n\n**Upcoming Features**\n\nThe MoonTrust team is not stopping with their current iteration of the app. They are also working on a governance and moderation mechanism. The goal is to allow token holders to ban/mute each other based on their stake in the project. For example, a whale can ban a small fish, but if enough fish and dolphins team up, they can also remove whales. Although the MoonTrust App works on mobile devices, the MoonTrust team is also working on iOS and Android apps to improve user interfaces and user experience. They are working on new designs to better suit the viewing and usage experience of mobile devices.\n\n**Upcoming Multiple Blockchain Support**\n\nThe MoonTrust project is aiming to launch its platform across all blockchains that have token projects built in them. The MoonTrust team is targeting one blockchain launch per year. Their platform launch for Cardano, Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and Avalanche are currently in the works.\n\nApp:[ https://moontrust.net/](https://moontrust.net/)\n\nInformational Website:[ https://moontrust.info/](https://moontrust.info/)\n\nTwitter:[ https://twitter.com/MoonTrustTeam](https://twitter.com/MoonTrustTeam)\n\nTelegram:[ https://t.me/MoonTrustOfficial](https://t.me/MoonTrustOfficial)",

As a result, developers who are building solutions on top of the TRON network will have access to the Link platform that speeds up the deployment of such apps. Also, Link reduces the cost of development by a significant margin. \n\n Essentially, Link is a blockchain infrastructure-as-a-service that enables developers to use smart contracts and blockchain protocols without necessarily having expertise in blockchain development. Developers can use Link to create standard web-based APIs for smart contracts based on programmatic blockchain networks such as TRON. The Link ecosystem uses the BLINK token as its main medium of exchange.\n\nSince its launch, the TRON blockchain has added lots of unique functionalities with an aim of attracting developers and other users. Its most significant achievement to date is overtaking the Ethereum blockchain to become the preferred choice for DApp developers. In fact, it currently has the highest number of DApp users, as well as the highest volume of DApp usage on a daily basis.\n\nProponents of the *Link* platform perceive it as the missing piece that will streamline the development of blockchain-driven apps. This is because it allows both users and developers to easily interact with blockchain smart contracts. Most importantly, the process is straightforward, as it doesn't require a gas fee, browser plugins or any other additional software. Moreover, its users are spared of the troubles of constantly monitoring web infrastructure and servers. All that is needed is the integration of the desired smart contracts to the app under development using Link. From here, the developer modifies the app just as they would if they were using a standard API. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Getting $MERL is pretty much as simple as buying other tokens on exchanges. \n\nHolders of MERL will be able to exclusively take part in the stake pools in the platform to earn some tokens.\n\n2. Another intriguing feature of Merlin Labs is the fact that it launches on Binance Smart Chain. This is in a bid to curbing the excessive transaction fee caused by ethereum network. \n\nUsers on Merlin Labs will be able to trade seamlessly at little or almost zero transaction fee.\n \n3. Also, in the future, Merlin plans on moving to a cross-chain. \n\nThat is, integrating other blockchains into the platform to allow users multiple choices.\n\nhttps://merlinlab.com/farm",

Positive news comes when expanding the team and MVP (Community Management & Development Services).  The transition from ICO to IEO is scheduled for the end of April 2019 and will be implemented through the ChainCreator Exchange.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tgzp0b51yct21.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=639617897d0331644e5ded0d6b69fcf8e7cbb715\n\n IEO is expected to benefit from the expanded coverage of the existing ChainCreator user base and their social networks.  The CDEX token (native token COLLECTIVE) will also receive an automatic and immediate listing after the completion of IEO.  In turn, ChainCreator will benefit from increased trading volume before and after the completion of IEO, additional regular users and increased community participation.  COLLECTIVE manages an ecosystem of products and / or services based on community management.  ICO / IEO is used to fund products other than MVP, which include:\n\n \\- CDEX, a fully functioning global decentralized market for Ethereum-based tokens.\n\n \\- TraderOne, a centralized exchange.  TraderOne will be a reliable trading platform for trading all types of digital assets.\n\n \\- Game CollectiveGO.  It will be an augmented reality experience supported by our own token (CDEX) and monetized through various digital currency advertisers.\n\n \\- A collective global initiative.  This includes all core values, providing creative ways to unite a concert economy, create common best practices for the entire industry, and protect communities, providing reliable outlets for everyone in a crypto space.",

Ethereum-based tokens will be the only token available on Dex, because of their decentralized nature, users will not have to save their private keys to Dex, they will be able to connect different types of wallets supported by The Collective platform. Some of these supported wallets are preferred as MyEtherWallet, MyCrypto, MetaMask. In the Collectivego video game, gamers will be able to enjoy the game, while the game lovers can be encouraged by doing what they love while playing video games. Because the VR functionality that makes them feel like they are in the game and the ability to participate in the games of the best game developers will be available on the platform.\n\nThe tokens used to encourage players will be held in custody at the end of the day to ensure that they receive their rewards and to connect their wallets to the Collective platform so that players can transfer their funds to the wallets they desire. Advertisers should also keep in mind that they can advertise within the game using Cdex token and this will enable the ecosystem to grow faster.\n\nAll these aspects of The Collective ecosystem include all the functionality in the ecosystem and provide a fast all-in-one solution.

            "text": "&#x200B;\n\nMillennials and Gen-X continue to be attracted to cryptocurrency as a financial and investment instrument. This emerging demographic is open to establishing new relationships with online financial institutions and the market has, in our estimation, aggressively courted this new financial customer. In the past ten years, investors have funded 2,441 fintech startups capitalizing on this opportunity. In addition, crypto investors funded another 202 fintech Security Token Offerings (STO) projects in the past two years.\n\n **The Neo-Bank Advantage**\n\n The term neo bank refers to web-based banks which provide financial services through web and mobile applications. These Neo banks often function without physical offices or branches. In return for automating and optimizing service, Neo banks may pass a portion of the resulting savings back to the customer through reduced fees or increased interest rates. The advantage of neo banks is their ability to leverage technology to optimize incumbent bank processes. By limiting customer interactions to self-serve digital products, management contends financial services companies can dramatically reduce headcount. Success stories abound: \n\n\u25cf Monzo, based in the United Kingdom self-reported 750,000 customers and only 300 employees. \n\n\u25cf Robinhood, a United States brokerage, is estimated to service 6,000,000 retail traders with a staff of 250 employees.\n\n In a large survey conducted by Jumio, 92 percent of Millennials report using mobile banking; however the survey includes important insights, such as 75 percent report dissatisfaction with the existing app experience . Other important information gathered deduced that 80 percent of consumers would switch financial institutions for a better experience6 . Traditional banks appear to lag behind technology-focused competition in delivering excellent app experiences.  \n\n **Fundraising with Ethereum Tokens**\n\n In 2014, the Ethereum Foundation raised \\~31,500 BTC ($18 million at the time) in the first public crypto-asset crowd sale, setting the record for the biggest one-time crowdfunding initiative of the Internet Age7 . Participating in the Ether crowdsale turned out to be one of the largest short-term wealth-generating events in history, creating a broad class of investors willing and interested in investing in a new generation of applications built with this technology. The generally acknowledged success of crypto-asset public fundraising, in addition to the simple replicability of token deployment, has led to an onward going enthusiasm in token-based fundraising. As of July 2018, over 100,000 of ERC20-compatible tokens have been provisioned on the Ethereum main network. The inflection point where STO and STO funding began outpacing blockchain venture investments coincided with Ethereum\u2019s mainnet launch. Before Ethereum, there was less than $100 million total of combined equity/token investments of total equity and token investments. $1 million VC rounds were once considered large and newsworthy events for the industry, but this is no longer the case. Token offerings have generated approximately $20 billion to date. This amounts to over five times the VC equity investment into blockchain startups (nearing $4 billion).\n\n **The Burden of International Compliance** \n\nIssuers and financial technology startups operating at a global scale are required to comply with United States banking regulations. Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations involve managing private and sensitive personal customer information and the third-party verification of these documents. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations require screening and monitoring participants against international sanctions, politically exposed persons flags (PEP), and adverse media lists. Issuers and startups must additionally comply with European regulations around data privacy and source of funds. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires all technology services, encompassing financial technology services, to give users the ability to retrieve all personal data and the right-to-be-forgotten. \n\n Management has determined that existing compliance and customer onboarding is often manual, time-intensive, and costly. In-house compliance programs are typically inadequate and/or data gathered is incomplete, inaccurate or unverified. Third-party services and compliance experts may be too expensive for issuers that are required to perform compliance in order to raise capital. For transactions related to international blockchain-based offerings, many issuers are unfamiliar with global regulations outside of their jurisdiction. In some cases, issuers do not comply with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations and have improperly sold tokens into the US market without an exemption to registration. Over the course of 2018 the SEC significantly increased the scope and instances of repercussions, often forcing issuers to return all funds to investors, sometimes resulting in charges and convictions.  In today's market, compliance has become central to any business attempting to raise funds. \n\n**The Trend to Card Payments** \n\nCryptocurrency detractors often point to low adoption in actual payments. It is common knowledge that cryptocurrency is not widely accepted by merchants as a form of payment. Historically, early evangelists would urge merchants to add crypto as a payment option. However, over the past year, the market has changed course. Instead of requiring merchants to accept crypto, new services emerged to allow crypto enthusiasts to load funds onto a prepaid debit card. BitPay, a leading provider of merchant services, offers a VISA debit card in all fifty US states. Cryptopay based in England offers plastic and prepaid debit cards denominated in a number of world currencies and funded by cryptocurrency. Wirex, another company in the space, claims to be launching in Canada soon. \n\n **Increasing Lifetime Value**\n\n Industry data shows that purchases within an affiliate environment generate a 21% higher average conversion than traditional shopping and a realization of 58% higher average customer revenue.Consumers introduced through affiliate channels place more orders at higher price points. Elevated order value, combined with repeat purchases, make these consumers exceptionally valuable. Loyalty programs are generally known to be popular with millennial consumers. Over 70% of Millennials and Pre-millennials are members of loyalty programs vs. less than 20% among Baby Boomers.

Developers of web, mobile and other decentralized applications that interact with smart contracts on GoChain-compatible public and private blockchains will be able to use Blockmason's Link to speed up their development cycles while reducing overhead and costs.\n\nBlockmason's Link is a new blockchain infrastructure-as-a-service\u00a0that allows app, web and other software developers to use smart contracts and programmatic blockchains like GoChain in their applications without requiring any blockchain experience. Using Link, a developer can create classic, conventional web-based APIs for any smart contract written on a programmatic blockchain. At the heart of Link is BLINK, the utility token which provides Link users with API transaction capacity.\n\nLaunched with the goal of solving the core scaling issues facing public blockchains like Ethereum, GoChain has since evolved into one of the best-performing public blockchain networks. The company's focus has expanded to include the enterprise blockchain space and into building the most reliable and highest performance Ethereum/web3 compatible blockchain on the market today.\n\n\"GoChain's vision and commitment to making blockchains easier to use are perfectly aligned with our mission for Link,\" said Michael Chin, Chief Executive Officer of Blockmason. \"Together, we can make developing smart contract and blockchain-based DApps much easier for developers, whether they are working in a small startup team or an enterprise-scale organization.\"\n\nLink is viewed as the missing component in blockchain-based app development. With Link, developers and users alike can interact with smart contracts like any other web API. There are no \"gas\" cryptocurrencies to acquire, browser plugins to install or other unnecessary hurdles. There's also no servers or web infrastructure to maintain or monitor. A developer simply adds the smart contracts they want to use in their app to Link. Once added, they can read from and write to these smart contracts just like any other API.\n\nTo learn more about the Link project and the BLINK token, visit\u00a0[https://blockmason.link/](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2393061-1&h=81858999&u=https%3A%2F%2Fblockmason.link%2F&a=https%3A%2F%2Fblockmason.link%2F).\n\n**About Blockmason**  \nBlockmason is a world-class developer of blockchain technology, focused on building the foundational base-layer frameworks that support the blockchain revolution.

            "text": "**Gemstra** is a blockchain-integrated ecosystem that democratizes and liberates social selling for the global retail economy. They launched the first ever social selling marketplace called BOUTIQUES Marketplace in July 2017. This marketplace enabled the connection between retail brands and social selling, giving sellers the freedom to choose products/brands they wish to represent. Now BOUTIQUES is not just some new startup, in less than a year, the marketplace added 8 brands, 3000 sellers and grossed over $5 Million in annual sales volume. \n\n**Gemstra** also provides a technological infrastructure with the **Astra Platform**; it goes to retailers and brands as a way to integrate and build their **social selling** channel. They give a leverage blockchain with knowledge placed within the fingers of sellers.\u00a0Providing this service would allow what in the **Gemstra** ecosystem are referred as \u201cretailers\u201d and types from the $24 trillion international retail economic system a way to affix **social promoting.**\n\nWith the open software supplied by **Gemstra** and an SDK, they will be able to combine them with the **ASTRA platform**, and use the **GMS Token** as ASTRA\u2019s default trade of worth. This **GMS Token** will be used for every move involved with payments. It would also be used for commission, rewards and, general governance of the **ASTRA Platform**.\u00a0\n\n**What is Social Selling?**\n\nThe art of using social networks as a way to locate and directly interact with prospects and customers is what we know as **social selling**. If you want to find out about the first social sellers, you might have to go back to early in the 1900\u2019s, when Brands hired independent representatives or \u201csellers\u201d to go door by door and sell their products; this method helped thanks to its one-to-one demonstrations.\n\nSince then the **social selling** model has evolved with the help of technology. With the adoption of the Internet, social sellers have unlimited power in the market through online avenues, especially when it comes to reaching the social media.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x1s2672ttkr21.jpg?width=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=477396573bb4afa00fa47de095a19ff4435d58b5\n\n**ASTRA Platform**\n\n**Gemstra** will work on the **ASTRA platform**, a technological infrastructure used by retailers and brands as a way to integrate with and build a social selling channel; it\u2019s often seen as the solution to democratise the model to promote equity between sellers, retailers, and brands.\n\nWith the use of the **ASTRA platform**, it would solve captivity issues; it liberates **social selling** by leveraging the blockchain to store data, processing every action involved with transactions, and decentralizing its control.\n\nBy using **ASTRA**, any retailer and brand will be able to participate in **social selling** and gain benefits from all their user-friendly protocols.\u00a0 With the use of **ASTRA** and their **GMS Token**, it would be the first time that someone connects retail brands and **social selling**, allowing sellers to represent any variety of brands and let those retail brands to grow in their respective business industry easily.\n\n**Gemstra\u2019s blockchain**\n\nCaptive companies were the ones that dominated the **social selling**landscape; they kept sellers\u2019 data in their \u2018hands\u2019 locking it and storing them.\u00a0\n\nThis would come to an end with **Gemstra**\u2019s vision, decentralising the space and deleveraging the risk to sellers in the traditional model. With the use of the **GMS Token** in the ecosystem of **Gemstra** and giving a framework for rewards and governance and with Ethereum\u2019s technology, a decentralized architecture of blockchain would allow democratizing data on a public ledger and promoting both fairness and equity in the **social selling** model.\n\nThe **Gemstra Token (GMS)** \\- It is the default exchange of value for payments which offers gamification, rewards, and governance for social selling. The **ASTRA** Platform and GMS token bridge the $24 Trillion retail industry to social selling, creating a massive potential future market. They want to become the standard technological infrastructure and evidently bring in 50% of social selling transactions in the future.\n\n**Gemstra** is unlike any other projects out there, already they have a business that has been proven by growing quickly and doing over $5 Million in yearly sales volume. Also they have an experienced team that have scaled many consumer growth businesses.\n\n**Token Details**  \nToken: GMS  \nEthereum ERC-20: Compatible Token  \nTotal Allocation for Sale: 6,400,000,000 GMS  \nTotal Token Supply: 16,000,000,000 GMS  \nToken Price: $0.01 USD  \nAccepting: ETH,USD  \nExchange Rate (Token/USD): 100.00  \nPre-ICO: July 2018  \nICO: November 2018  \nEnd of ICO: December 2018 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite : [https://gemstra.com/](https://gemstra.com/)\n\nWhitepaper : [https://docsend.com/view/xvyqq7a](https://docsend.com/view/xvyqq7a)\n\nReddit : [https://www.reddit.com/r/Gemstra/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gemstra/)\n\nFacebook : [https://facebook.com/gemstraofficial](https://facebook.com/gemstraofficial)\n\nTwitter : [https://twitter.com/gemstraofficial](https://twitter.com/gemstraofficial)\n\nMedium : [https://medium.com/gemstra](https://medium.com/gemstra)\n\nBounty0x Username : nefsim",

            "text": "A Still-Impressive TL;DR: 2key in 300 Words\n\nHTTP links are a fundamental part of the web: they enable us to navigate through the web. In the scramble to decentralize the internet, the creation of Smart Links, which merge smart contracts into HTTP links, are the most effective means of pulling the masses towards a better, decentralized, and democratized web.\n\n2key Network has created the most advanced layer two solution for the Ethereum network. Any application built atop this layer benefits from the highly decentralized and robust security of Ethereum, while having the scalability benefits derived from 2key\u2019s development. The first application built upon this layer is 2key\u2019s *Smart Link*.\n\nUnlike a standard HTML link, which at best allows tracking of click data, the Smart Link is able to track every person that has come in contact with a link, while simultaneously associating a wallet with that person; this wallet can be unlocked through any browser, offline, thereby ensuring the security of the wallet\u2019s accrued assets. The purpose of the auto-creation of wallets is to ensure anyone who was involved in the chain of shares that eventually led to a customer-acquisition \u2014 a product sale, a content read, an investment, etc. \u2014 is rewarded for the role played in that conversion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cbwz5u6nqxz31.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f682952a94685375dfb9ae77085916c3a986e78\n\nThe rewards are sourced from contract creators who opt to attract a customer base through the most advanced digitalization of word of mouth: Smart Link sharing. Contract creators have the ability to set the terms which the HTML link-bound smart contracts should recognize as a conversion. Once the terms are met, the smart contract automatically distributes, among all who shared the link, the conversion payment the contract creator had set.\n\n2key Network democratizes the value distribution of the digital ad sector by allowing people to decentralize the web by simply sharing the same links they interact with every day.\n\n*This is the first article in 2key\u2019s 1-Month of Content.*\n\n***We invite you to have a firsthand experience of our breakthrough solution \u2014 Smart Links \u2014 on our testnet*** *(*[*https://test.2key.io*](https://test.2key.io/)*)****; you can be the pioneering drive in the first feasible solution in the scramble to decentralize the web.***\n\nMore details on our Website: [https://www.2key.network/](https://www.2key.network/)",

Backers are protected by the industry\u2019s escrow smart contract system and are rewarded for participation by cryptographic tokens. Decentralized user governance and access allows the network to grow exponentially and bring crowdfunding to aspiring entrepreneurs all over the world.\n\nAdvantage:\n\n\u00b7 A high potential market\n\n\u00b7 Famous advisors\n\nDisadvantage:\n\n\u00b7 No blockchain development experience\n\n**Industry**\u00a0:\n\nAccording to the Statista, transaction Value in the Crowdfunding segment amounts to US$9,342m in 2018. Transaction Value is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2018\u20132022) of 28.8% resulting in the total amount of US$25,750.2m by 2022. From a global comparison perspective, it is shown that the highest transaction value is reached in China (US$7,463m in 2018). Crowdfunding market is a multi-million-dollar market.\n\nTwo of the most recognizable leaders in crowdfunding are the US-based companies Kickstarter and Indiegogo. Founded in 2009 and 2008 respectively, these platforms offer similar services and each charge 5% in listing fees. In 2013, total monies pledged to Kickstarter projects hit a record $480 million. Though Kickstarter and Indiegogo are very successful, they still exist some problems due to their own design and local policy. Neither platform offers an escrow service or other investor protections to increase transparency, nor do they reward or incentivize user engagement to utilize the power of their crowd. Creating and pledging campaigns is limited to only certain countries and requires a recognized bank account and credit cards. Pledgecamp wants to use blockchain technology, especially smart contracts, to solve the existing problems. They want to be a blockchain-version Kickstarter.\n\nLike it was mentioned above, crowdfunding market is huge. But there is not much blockchain-based crowdfunding platform in the market. Pledgecamp has an opportunity to be the pioneer in the blockchain-based crowdfunding segment. (7/10)\n\n**Mode**\n\nPledgecamp is a crowdfunding platform based on Ethereum. Backers are protected by the industry\u2019s escrow smart contract system and are rewarded for participation by cryptographic tokens. It is basically a dApp with an ERC20 token.\n\nTo list a campaign, a creator must place a deposit on the blockchain with a native cryptocurrency called Pledge Coin (PLG). This deposit can be earned back when creators comply with disclosures that protect backers, such as by uploading business documents, performing identity verification, or engaging backers on a live video chat. This mechanism will increase transparency for backers to guide their investment decisions.\n\nPLG will be used to pledge campaigns and enable Backer Insurance, and it will also play a key role in cultivating the community by rewarding those who provide value to the network in the form of services. And like other cryptocurrencies, PLG will be borderless, inclusive and provide security and transparency for transactions.\n\nBacker Insurance is a security feature unique to Pledgecamp that gives backers the ability to mediate their own disputes and protect their funds from misuse. Backer Insurance comprises a percentage of funds that are collected during a campaign, held in escrow via smart contract, then released by backers by vote when milestones are met.\n\nThe whole idea is logical and decent. In addition, Pledgecamp does offer decentralized incentives to support early projects. Pledgecamp will not retain and subsist off of listing fees like current crowdfunding platforms. Rather, fees are collected and earned by the users who maintain and serve the network, creating a system where the crowd itself is incentivized by the long-term health of the community.(7.5/10)\n\n**Technology**:\n\nLike it was mentioned above, Pledgecamp is basically a dApp with an ERC20 token. Backer Insurance is an escrow wallet powered by a smart contract which enables backers to protect campaign funds from misuse by creators. So, the design of the smart contract is core of the project. Since there are no technical details in the whitepaper and there is also no technical whitepaper, we do not know how they will design the smart contracts. GitHub is not available as well. According to their medium, they will release a technical paper very soon. We can wait and see if they have a solid smart contract solution.(3/10)\n\n**Team**:\n\nThere are six core team members listed on Medium. All their LinkedIn links are listed. Four of them are graduated from UC Berkely. Jae Hoon Choi, the CEO, is former investment banker and product manager at Ustream. Eddie Lee, the President, is a former financial analyst at PBS Biotech. Sam Pullman, the CTO, is a former engineer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories. He is the lead of blockchain development. But there is no evidence proving that he has blockchain experience. John Fitzpatrick is the blockchain engineer. But also, there is no past experience described on his LinkedIn. CEO, President, CTO and UX/UI Designer are come from a company called Podo Labs. They are also founders of Podo Labs. Podo Labs is a consumer electronics design company that innovates and ships products from the ground up. There are three products listed on their website. These three products are all launched on Kickstarter and they are all successfully crowdfunded. One of the products even crowdfunded 40 times of the original goal. We can see that the team do have lots of experience in crowdfunding and do know what kinds of improvements crowdfunding platform need. But it is doubtful that they have enough blockchain experience on blockchain development.\n\nOn advisory end, they have more than 20 advisors. There are some famous advisors such as Randi Zuckerberg, founder of Zuckerberg Media, also known as sister of Mark Zuckerberg. They also have VP of Data at Ripple and Executive Chairman at Accelerated Digital Ventures as advisors. They have some high-quality advisors, but we think they have too many advisors. It seems like everyone who want to back the project can be listed on their website. They look more like fans rather than advisors.(7.5/10)\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nPledgecamp team has run several successful crowdfunding campaigns already. They have lots of experience in what works and what doesn\u2019t work in this space. Traditional crowdfunding platforms do exist some problems, and it is a huge opportunity for them to be a new player in the market by applying blockchain technology. The biggest concern is that if they have ability on blockchain developments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [https://pledgecamp.com/](https://pledgecamp.com/)\n\nWhitepaper: [https://pledgecamp.com/\\_\\_pdf/whitepaper-pledgecamp-9-23.pdf](https://pledgecamp.com/__pdf/whitepaper-pledgecamp-9-23.pdf)\n\nBounty0x ID: ecamli",

            "text": "Refine Medium has a comprehensive smart contract for its Initial Token Offering and the Decentralised App. The smart contract for the token, ICO and Dapp are all inter-related and work in harmony. Unlike any other ICO, Refine Medium has a very attractive referral system which rewards the investors a percentage of investment made by the investors they refer. The payout here is instantaneous which means as soon as the investor sends ether to our smart contract, the reward for referee is distributed in the same transaction and all of this will be visible in the respective blockchain explorers(etherscan.io) in order to maintain 100 % transparency. Not only this, the referral system is stretched upto two levels. Let us try to understand this with the help of an example, say user A refers user B and user B refers user C. In this case if user B invests 10 ether, user A will get 1 ether as a reward (10 %) and if user C invests 10 ether, user B and user A both will get 1 ether each as reward instantly. This provides an earning opportunity for investment pools and users with contacts in the crypto industry. Therefore, if any of our affiliates bring us a whale who invests a million USD in our project, the affiliate gets 100,000 USD as a reward in ETH.\n\nIn order to maintain the value over long term we have token burn functionality embedded in our contract. We will announce our token burn parties time to time and all the unused tokens will be burned making sure that the value of our token goes up and up in long term. The smart contract has been engineered in a way that it will be integrated in the DApp too. On liking, uploading and sharing the videos over our DApp, Refine Medium tokens will be rewarded to the user from the smart contract. In case the platform runs out of tokens in future, the smart contract will automatically generate new tokens (upto 300m in addition to the premined 300m tokens) and use these tokens to maintain the economy. During nascent stages of our ICO, we will not be transferring tokens to the users, in order to prevent dumping of tokens during the initial days of listing on exchanges. The tokens of team and seed investors will also be locked for a certain time duration for the same reason. This locking mechanism has been taken care of by the Refine Medium smart contract itself. Refine Medium smart contract has a dynamic pricing system in which the price changes every second linearly. We will have multiple rounds of ICO (presale, main sale, airdrop period) with different number of tokens allocated and different initial and final prices. In order to match with the fluctuating price of ethereum, we have parameterized price factor in the smart contract which helps us change the price of token during ICO on the fly.",

They have just announced the launch of their mobile app referred to as the **Wibson** token (WIB), plus the new data platform that is in Spain, UK, and Argentina.\n\nWibson, the decentralized consumer data marketplace backed by Telefonica\u2019s investment arm Wayra, has added global mobile marketing platform Jampp as a data buyer in its marketplace.\n\nConsumers can now share personal data directly with Jampp through the Wibson app and, in turn, be rewarded with Wibson utility tokens. In addition, the Wibson token (WIB) has made its debut on Coinsuper, a Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange.\n\nThe Wibson token and mobile app support consumer ability to sell their personal data directly to data buyers, such as technology platforms, advertisers, marketers, academics, and data-for-social-good researchers. In the Wibson marketplace, consumers decide when and to whom they share their data, based on transparent, market-driven offers that clearly outline the data requested, price, intended use, and data buyer.\n\n\u201cThe most valuable asset in the world is now data,\u201d said Wibson co-founder and CEO Mat Travizano. \u201cThe Wibson platform and utility token are giving consumers, for the first time, an easy way to get something back in return for the mountains of personal data they are continually creating. We\u2019re excited to welcome Jampp, one of the most respected brands in mobile engagement, to our marketplace and provide our users more options to generate value from their data.\u201d\n\nJampp helps mobile app marketers engage and acquire users with performance advertising.\u00a0\u201cBy using the Wibson marketplace as a new source of opted-in location data for our media targeting, we will be able to provide even better performance for our customers,\u201d said Jampp head of product Guido Crego. \u201cWith Wibson, we also know consumers are aware of their data being used while benefiting directly from the data transactions.\u201d\n\nThe Wibson token went live with the Wibson marketplace launch in October 2018 and claims more than 85,000 data transactions from more than 7,000 participants.\n\n The Wibson Marketplace Has Three Types Of Participants\n\n\u2022 The first is the data sellers \u2013 These are individuals who are looking to make some extra profit from their personal data in a transparent and trusted space one that is a market-driven environment.\n\n\u2022 The Data buyers \u2013 These are entities plus various businesses; the likes of the good social researchers, academics who are looking to purchase some authentic and validated data.\n\n\u2022 The Notaries \u2013 These are the organizations that are able to validate and verify the personal data that has been presented by the buyers in the platform. To ensure the buyers get accurate information, they also arbitrate any disputes that might arise during transactions.\n\nThe interaction that takes place within these three roles has been carefully governed by the use of smart contracts in the Wibson market. The contracts are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [https://wibson.org/](https://wibson.org/)\n\nBounty0x ID: ecamli",

Association empties the  deterrents to interfacing with quick contracts, empowering architects to  immediately change splendid contracts on any programmed blockchain into  simple to utilize applications. With the introduction of Link in the  ecosystem, the number of projects and DApps that will use the Credit  Protocol will increase in a general sense and exponentially. That is the  reason we can infer that the demand of BCPT will augment in light of  the fact that their deficiency will make it logically difficult to  obtain them.\u00a0\n\nAt the center of Link is  BLINK, the Link utility token. To say it obviously, BLINK is the  required \"fuel\" that powers Link, offering access to the organization  and API trade limit. Right when an architect uses Link to manufacture an  API for their splendid contract, and that API is used, BLINK must be  used. Blockmason's focal objective is to develop a structure of  libraries, contracts, programs, applications, substance, and market  makers that will more likely than not change the step by step life.  Blockmason's first segment in the market is a Credit Protocol that hopes  to change the creation of credit through recorded commitments and  duties on the blockchain.\n\n# Benefits Of Blockmason\u2019s Link\n\nThe platform is built with simplicity and easy to use for all even for anyone with no prior blockchain technology experience.\n\nFacilitates  the creation of Blockchain Backed\u00a0Mobile Applications - Link  streamlines the creation of\u00a0very versatile applications that could  communicate with the blockchain in the simples manner\u00a0\n\nIntegration  of High-level Security-Link features consistent, automated security  checking of all establishment and related applications\u00a0\n\nAvailability  of Infrastructure For DApp development- Link suggests not gathering or  take care of servers, centers or different systems with the true  objective for customers to abuse decentralized applications\u00a0\n\nAutomated  documentation and test code - Link makes, coordinates and invigorates  use documentation and test code for all enrolled applications and smart  contracts. Blockmason\u2019s Link perceives how an application is being used \u2013  with a point by point recognition, logs, and encounters.\n\nTHE BLINK TOKEN\n\nFacilitating  all transactions and processes on Blockmason\u2019s Link is its own native  currency the BLINK token. Due to the efficiency of transactions on  Etherum network Blockmason\u2019s BLINK token is built on ethereum blockchain  according to erc20 standards.\n\nToken Name: Blockmason Link\u00a0\n\nTicker: BLINK\u00a0\n\nPlatform: Etherum\n\nToken Type: Utility\n\nDecimals: 18\n\nTotal Token Supply: 5,000,000,000 Blink\n\nUseful Links\n\nWebsite:  [https://blockmason.io](https://blockmason.io/)\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/blockmason](https://t.me/blockmason)\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/blockmasonlink](https://twitter.com/blockmasonlink)\n\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/blockmasonio](https://www.facebook.com/blockmasonio)\n\nReddit: [https://reddit.com/r/blockmason](https://reddit.com/r/blockmason)",

As a financiai service provider, it will ensure that all users of crypto coins are satisfied and that they can communicate with fiats currencies in all simplicity and security, all the things they want to do with their crypto coins. For this reason, KABN can handle all transactions that have a good relevance with money and at the same time make it possible to use cards such as a private branded visa card. Therefore, this card is linked to the wallet provided to users and also applies to the traditional banking system, so that users can use them as a portal to access both crypto funds and fiat funds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Features:**\n\nAuthentication and verification up to 180 countries\n\nKYC using 2 + 2 matching with Revitalizer\n\nAML continuous monitoring\n\nBiometric Enhanced\n\nCustomer Controlled\n\nGDP Compliant\n\nOptions Accreditation / Richness Source.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLinks:\n\nWebsite: [https://www.kabntoken.com/](https://www.kabntoken.com/)  \nWhitepaper: [https://www.kabntoken.com/whitepaper.V1.2.pdf](https://www.kabntoken.com/whitepaper.V1.2.pdf)  \nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/kabnnetwork/](https://www.facebook.com/kabnnetwork/)  \nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/KABNNETWORK](https://twitter.com/KABNNETWORK)  \nLinkedin: [https://www.linkedin.com/company/kabn/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kabn/)  \nTelegram: [http://kabn.network/telegram-links.php](http://kabn.network/telegram-links.php)  \nMedium: [https://medium.com/@KABN](https://medium.com/@KABN)  \nYoutube: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UPtKmwfZP\\_g](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UPtKmwfZP_g) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nToken KABN\n\nType Utility\n\nPrice 1 KABN = 0.2 USD\n\nPlatform Ethereum\n\nAccepting ETH, BTC, Fiat\n\nCountry Gibraltar\n\nWhitelist/KYC KYC\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **bounty0x username: germandivision**",

It has announced Link which seeks to assist smart contract and blockchain innovation and use in enterprises. Link is a blockchain infrastructure-as-a-service (BIaaS) which enables enterprise developers to use smart contracts and programmatic blockchains \u2013 like Ethereum, TRON and others \u2013 in applications without requiring blockchain experience. With Link, a developer can create conventional web-based APIs for any smart contract written on a programmatic blockchain. At the heart of Link is BLINK, a utility token which provides Link users with API transaction capacity. \n\n \n\n## The basics of the Blockmason Link proposition\n\nBlockmason views Link as the missing component in blockchain-based app development. It believes that, with Link, developers and users can interact with smart contracts much as with any other web API. For example, there are no:\n\n* \u2018gas\u2019 cryptocurrencies to acquire\n* browser plugins to install\n* servers or web infrastructure to maintain or monitor.\n\nDevelopers add the smart contracts they want to use in their apps \u2018to Link\u2019. Once added, they can read from and write to these smart contracts just like any other API. In effect the Blockmason claim is that this creates classic, conventional web-based APIs for any smart contract written on a programmatic blockchain.\n\n## The problems Link addresses\n\nBlockchain development has a high barrier to entry. At present, when adding blockchain tech to existing systems, developers must:\n\n* learn the essentials of blockchain\n* code in new languages, and with different approaches\n* undertake complex processes to sign, send, write to and retrieve data from the blockchain\n* transcend countless integration obstacles.\n\nIt is much the same for users. For the casual user, interacting with blockchain-based apps is difficult \u2013 or near to impossible. Before using an app, a user must first navigate some or all of:\n\n* cryptocurrency exchanges\n* wallets\n* transfers\n* security challenges\n* browser plugins\n* and much more.\n\n## Why Link might be a solution\n\nThe principle claim made for Link is that there is *\u201cno blockchain experience required\u201d.* Link seeks to make blockchain development accessible to those with traditional programming experience. In addition, the point made earlier applies: there are no \u2018extra\u2019 servers or web infrastructure to maintain or monitor.\n\nExtending this, with Link, developers and users can interact with smart contracts like they do with any other web API. There are no cryptocurrencies to acquire, browser plugins to install, etc . This makes for an app experience where developers can offers users a familiar web-based experience. The blockchain \u2014 and its complexities \u2014 become invisible to app users.\n\nBenefits which Link could bring include:\n\n* convenience (and, implicitly, ease of use)\n* enterprise-grade security (Link features continuous, automated security monitoring of all infrastructure and associated apps)\n* mobile application readiness (Link simplifies the creation of walletless mobile apps which can interact with the blockchain)\n* managed, high-availability infrastructure (Link means not having to build or maintain servers, nodes or other infrastructure in order for users to exploit decentralised apps)\n* automated documentation and sample code (Link generates, syncs and updates usage documentation and sample code for all registered apps and smart contracts)\n* monitoring, analytics and data visualisation (here, Link helps to understand how an app is being used \u2013 with detailed visualisations, logs and insights).",

Our team is motivated by the idea our coin will have a use-case from day one! The gambling industry has been around for centuries, and there will be an ever-growing crowd of \u2018gamblers\u2019 and players in the crypto world, as cryptocurrencies slowly become the staple in terms of money transactions around the world. In order to support this transition, WIN wishes to establish itself as the most competitive and well-known lottery token in the industry, all the while progressively growing a following.\u00a0\n\n**How it works:**\n\nWith WIN, the chances of winning are relative to how many tokens you hold, which means that all holders are incentivized to buy more tokens in the long term if they wish to increase their chances of winning the lottery.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, the requirement to be eligible at winning the lottery is relatively low, at the value of 777,777 tokens, which means all holders are incentivized to HODL in the hopes of winning a huge prize.\u00a0\n\nChances of winning will be calculated in indirect proportion to how many tokens each holder has. This means that having more tokens does increase your chances of winning, but not in a linear fashion. Instead, a logarithmic function will be used to convert the proportion of holdings that each investor has, and calculate their chances of winning accordingly.\u00a0\n\nThis will lower the discrepancy in the probability of winning between a whale and a small investor while keeping our larger investors at an advantage.\u00a0\n\n**A note on marketing:**\n\nIn the framework of the gambling industry, marketing plays a key driver for all the parties involved. For the organization, marketing attracts a larger pool of players who can participate in the activities/lotteries. For the players, as more players are participating in the lotteries, this results in larger payouts being handed out. Since gambling is a high-risk, high reward activity, it is vital that a sufficient number of individuals are made aware of the present games in order to diversify the risks amongst the population of players.\n\nIn the case of WIN, the same applies, but with greater flexibility. Our ability to attract crypto investors as well as \u2018gamblers\u2019 increases the impact of our marketing, but this is unfortunately counterbalanced by the fact that we need to spend on marketing on a daily basis, for the aforementioned reasons. In order for our venture to be successful in the long term, WIN needs a constant marketing push, which imposes a marketing expense as part of the prize wallet. The complete breakdown of how this is executed is given in the whitepaper on the WIN website.\u00a0\n\n**Launch**\n\nThis coin is launching on Sunday, after hosting a private sale on Friday and a pre-sale on Saturday. With the current level of effort and transparency put into this project, this could be the next very big thing.\u00a0\n\n**More info:**\u00a0\n\nWebsite:[ https://www.wintoken.online/](https://www.wintoken.online/)\n\nTelegram:[ https://t.me/wintokencommunity](https://t.me/wintokencommunity)",

On EJECT, retail investors will find up and coming block-chain projects to invest in.\n\nInstead of private sales, presales, airdrops, audits and marketing being done separately by each individual team on a variety of platforms, EJECT will host each phase of the growth of a Coin.\n\n$EJECT is the native utility token that will be used for:\n\n**Developers:**\n\n* To Create and Launch projects\n\n**Investors:**\n\n* To back projects\n* To invest in projects\n* To trade $EJECT for the project's tokens or get rewarded in EJECT tokens\n\n**Why Will EJECT be The Next 500x Token?**\n\nUnlike many new projects, EJECT has a real world use-case RIGHT NOW! If you are a meme-coin/shit-coin investor, you know the drill. When making an investment decision, you have to:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. Find projects that won't rugpull and those that won't be burnt to ashes 3 hours after launch.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. Scout the Internet for decent upcoming pre-sales without there being any centralized hub to find them.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3. Leave a project as soon as you've 5x'd because you know they're mostly just pump and dumps.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4. Rely on the hype, telegram members, poocoin ads, the relentless Reddit spam to find these projects.\n\n**Right?**\n\nAnd that is why the future EJECT platform ALREADY has a ready market of hundreds, if not thousands of investors/ day traders/ moonshot hopefuls who are looking for a place where reliable information is conveniently available, and where investing is easy and safe!\n\n**The way things are RIGHT NOW:**\n\nUnder our noses, genuine developers with great projects and a vision go unnoticed because few con-men have learned the art of MARKETING and pulling the rug after launch.\n\nImagine a marketplace where the success of a new project is not decided by the marketing that goes into it, but the actual use-case? A place where you can access all the best new crypto projects, learn everything about them, interact through verified channels with the dev team, and invest with great convenience and speed if convinced by the project.\n\nThis also applies to shitcoins or memecoins because, as the community rules, any project that gets backing can see the light.\n\nOur care is for the best to come to the limelight, irrespective of shenanigans and marketing budgets. We propose to host AMAs on our website, where developers can discuss their ideas with investors, and impose an auditing process for all projects that want to get listed on EJECT.\n\n**How will EJECT achieve its goal?**\n\nEJECT will be a centralized platform where potential investors will be able to see the latest pre-audited projects. The EJECT token will be the currency for backing a project through their private sales or presales. EJECT will also manage airdrops and reward customers who stake EJECT tokens and complete shilling tasks.\n\nWith the EJECT token as the currency and a prerequisite for backing projects, there is a REAL world use case for $EJECT, thereby attracting more holders and elevating the price of the EJECT token.\n\n**When will EJECT Development start?**\n\nWe have started to document the project already. The development of the platform will start in late June 2021 and a beta version will likely be launched in early August 2021.\n\nThe platform will use the same type of safety mechanism that DxSale uses. No one, not even the platform developers, will be able to access the raised funds outside the rules and timelines agreed upon by investors and project leaders.\n\nCurrently, **EJECT has a Market Cap of $500K, with 1,500 REAL HOLDERS.**\n\nWebsite:\u00a0[www.eject.space](http://www.eject.space/)\n\nTelegram:\u00a0[https://t.me/EjectElonCommunity](https://t.me/EjectElonCommunity)",

The remaining 75% is allocated for pre-sale and sale for the community. The unsold tokens from the ICO will be incinerated to hell.\n\nThe Shiba Kenzo spokesperson Lucy Haei said the company's intent with the meme token is to bring cryptocurrency to the mainstream and give people an opportunity to be a part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\n**About the Shiba Kenzo Token**\n\nThe Shiba Kenzo token (KENZO) is the native BEP-20 compliant token issued on the Binance Smart Chain platform, which ensures speedy transactions and security, as well as compatibility with other third-party services. The token has a hard cap of $500,000, or 1500BNB, and can be purchased through PancakeSwap after the pre-sale ends.\n\nThe Shiba Kenzo (KENZO) token enables users to earn five percent of each transaction, which will be redistributed to holders and automatically adds five precent to the liquidity pool. While this is standard tokenomics, what makes the Shiba Kenzo (KENZO) token unique is that it is a meme token with an actual use case. Purchasers will be able to stake their Shiba Kenzo (KENZO) tokens on their own upcoming yield farming site, which means buyers will earn a lot more yield than a regular meme token on the market. The yield farming site will be launched in the fourth quarter.\n\nShiba Kenzo complies with all the necessary KYC/AML procedures protecting both its project and its users from fraudulent activities.\n\nContact: Spokesperson Lucy Haei  \nFor more information, visit [shibakenzo.com](https://pr.report/QxPIE9Ca).  \nContact : [Info@shibakenzo.com](mailto:Info@shibakenzo.com)  \n[https://twitter.com/shiba\\_kenzo](https://twitter.com/shiba_kenzo)\n\nSource :   \n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shiba-kenzo-plans-initial-coin-153500348.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shiba-kenzo-plans-initial-coin-153500348.html)",

How does it work? And is the Daddy model sustainable?\n\nDaddy is a cryptocurrency token built on the Binance Smart Chain. Each transaction, purchase or sell, incurs a 15% fee, 6% of which is automatically redistributed amongst all holders in the form of BNB. Their long awaited pre-sale and launch is on Monday, June the 28th.\n\nThis little twist on Tokenomics has found a good investor base, as exemplified by the likes of Ghostface, HODL, or TIKI token, three projects which have recently had very successful launches. However, DADDY claims to be superior to its competitors, hence its name.\n\nDADDY claims to solve this problem two specific ways:\n\nFirst of all, the token includes a Marketing fee within its Tax. This fee will allow the project to constantly attract external investors, and keep the transaction volume at a solid baseline.\n\nHow this can be achieved is by using principles of cluster marketing. As they move forward in the life of their coin, Daddy\u2019s branding approach will start to include additional components related to spreading awareness on child abuse. While a 1% fee is already donated to charity, Daddy will also make sure to focus their marketing message on spreading awareness on this major issue which is often tabou or \u201cunder-discussed\u201d. The problem of child abuse, which is Universal, is common all around the world but rarely brought up, especially in underdeveloped countries, and does not require donations as much as it necessitates the spread of awareness. Daddy will therefore bind their brand image with the notion of child protection, and awareness about child abuse.\n\n\u2705 Website:\u00a0[https://www.daddytoken.net/](https://www.daddytoken.net/)\n\n\u2705 Telegram community:\u00a0[https://t.me/thedaddytoken](https://t.me/thedaddytoken)\n\n\u2705 Twitter:\u00a0[https://twitter.com/TheDaddyToken](https://twitter.com/TheDaddyToken)",

Here are a number of problems  that we consider the main ones, and we offer a number of solutions to  them.\n\n# Problems\n\n1. The slow growth of medical capacity, the insignificant effect of progress in medicine on human health, and quality of life.\n2. Weak integration of science in the diagnosis of the human condition and treatment of diseases - both congenital and acquired.\n3. Scientific  advances in medicine are rarely implemented. They often remain \u201con  paper\u201d, blocked by patent restrictions and bureaucracy. If the  restrictions and all legal issues are settled, a long-term period of  integration of scientific knowledge and achievements in real life is  required. They will be implemented in developed countries first, with  limited access. Decades may pass before the technology is widely  accepted.\n4. Perception  of the current situation as a given, without the possibility to change  it. The current situation is considered \u201cnormal\u201d.\n5. Scientists  are supported on a leftover basis. The most important role is  frequently played by charities and individuals. The government stands  aside from this issue, especially in developing countries. Developments  are ignored and lost.\n\n# Solution\n\n1. The launch of a marketing campaign focused on increasing the value of health, quality and opportunities of medicine\n2. Creation  of a non-profit organization. It will include research centers, R&D  centers, clinics for the practical implementation of knowledge and  technologies.\n3. Formation  of the main directions of development that require a revolution in the  methods of diagnosis and treatment. Special attention should be paid to  rare diseases that are currently considered as \u201ccommercially  impractical\u201d to research.\n4. Creation  of a development ecosystem that will bring together researchers,  scientists, medicine, and IT specialists. Creation of a global cluster  that will work on solving issues.\n\n# Goals for the next 5 years:\n\n1. Increasing  the human life expectancy by 10 years until 2027. Development in this  direction, search for current constraints and their elimination.\n2. Increasing the medical capacity and abilities of medical professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.\n3. Increasing the ability to diagnose health conditions for everyone.\n4. Creation of a research center and clinic within the framework of a solution to main problems.\n\n# The first part of directions for the project\n\n1. Development  of a mobile/stationary blood oxygen enrichment apparatus. A modern and  quick solution, an alternative to mechanical ventilation and ECMO (the  problem of maintaining a person's life with severe lung damage).\n2. Development  of modern equipment - both for professional and home usage. Expanding  the possibilities of diagnosing the state of blood vessels and blood  flows. Emphasis on this area as the main method for studying strokes and  heart attacks.\n\nIn the  US, this market can be estimated at about $745 billion a year. (33% of  all expenses). This is a combination of three problems.\n\nWe  do not focus on just one country, but the US budget is shown as a  reference and serves to potential investors to appreciate the importance  of the direction and the project as a whole.\n\n**To analyze the markets of other countries**\n\nUnited Kingdom - $65.142 billion (total budget $197.4 billion)\n\nGermany - $149.5 billion (total budget $453.056 billion)\n\nFrance - $103.29 billion (total budget $313 billion)\n\nRussia - $29.27 billion (total budget $88.7 billion)\n\nUkraine - $3.36 billion (total budget $10.2 billion)\n\n**More info, Interview from the creator of the project:**\n\n[https://zycrypto.com/givetime-io-cryptocurrency-science-and-healthcare-interview-with-alexander-movchan/](https://zycrypto.com/givetime-io-cryptocurrency-science-and-healthcare-interview-with-alexander-movchan/)\n\n# Benefits of being a project investor\n\n**Benefits for medium term investment (3-9 months):**\n\n* Open project and team. Ready to answer any question in the community. Publicly and privately.\n* Token passed security audit\n* Project founder passed KYS\n* There is no large commission for token transactions. Only 0.1% is a good solution for arbitrage and trading.\n* Tokens are locked. A clear system and conditions for their unlocking.\n* The project is young. Hence has a minimum token valuation. Successful entry start, at the best prices.\n* A real roadmap - into a physical product. Most of the other projects are focused only on online development.\n* Investor packages are also available. At good token purchase prices.\n* There is a clear exit program for CEX, at the beginning of tier 2-3, then tier 1.\n* The  development of the project product gives a clear understanding of how  the GTM token will grow, what its purpose is, what driving forces it  will have.\n* The  wide niche of the project's activities allows you to immediately assess  the potential for community growth and the interest of all mankind in  solving these goals.\n* A  huge market in the world and rich countries, both in terms of services  and equipment. All this will be successfully used for popularization and  rapid development of the project.\n\n**Benefits for long term investment (12-120 months):**\n\n* For the top 100.

Are you ready to skyrocket to the moon?\n\n**ScorpGames** **-** It is a new type of game partially owned and operated by its Players. By owning ScorpNFTs, holders have more opportunities of completing the stages and ultimately earn more profits attached to each stage. 10% in BNB and 5% in $ScorpFin on every trade that occurs simply just by holding. Easy peasy!\n\n* **ScorpSwap V2 (Decentralized Exchange) -** With low fees and special features, projects will use this platform and this will generate income. With this income, manual burning of $ScorpFin is done which will reduce supply thus causing scarcity and token price increase inevitably.\n* **ScopNFTracker & Marketplace** **-** This is a revolutionary application in the crypto industry with which users don't only track their NFT assets but also mint, sell and collect digital arts. This will bring traffic to the Scorpion Finance ecosystem thereby generating buying pressure on $ScorpFin. Remember, the reflection rewards mentioned earlier? Hold is gold!\n* **ScorpGames (ScorpMultiverse) -** It is a game changer in the digital space, an upgrade of Metaverse. While Meta deals with one digital universe, Multi applies to more than one universe. A user can create an avatar of himself simply with his phone and explore the multiple digital universes, conquer and earn coins straight into his Trust/Metamask wallet. Invitation of other users, display of NFTs and  purchase of digital lands (ScorpLands) are among the awesome features of ScorpMultiverse which will drive mass adoption of $ScorpFin thus increasing value for holders.\n* **ScorPay** **-** It is a brand of payment solution that aims to bridge the gap between the Fiat and Cryptocurrency. There are going to be merchants accepting $ScorpFin as mode of payments in the near future. This is an adoption that will change the financial industry and holders will benefit immensely from the price drive simply by holding.\n\n\ud83d\udcb5BUY : 0x475c8df9860e42605d9917f0a2e522cc861cbf82 - Smart Contract\n\nWebsite: www dot scorpion-finance dot com \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/88nmvv5hesg81.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d13743a89dd08958ea0b55de00eb5cb1f2a61288",

You\u2019re probably wondering what makes Verify different than all of these other shilled posts, so allow me explain.\n\nCryptocurrency crimes rose by **1,000%** in the last year alone! According to the FTC, **consumers lost at least 80 million dollars** as a result. Guess who the consumers are\u2026us. And, nobody is stepping up to protect \u2018us\u2019 so there is a clear need for what Verify is doing!\n\n[Verify](https://www.verifytoken.net/) is bringing full transparency to the crypto market. **The utility behind Verify is Verify Lens.** It is a cloud-based dashboard that will gather data on defi projects\u2014new and old\u2014to aid the investor in making a more informed decision. The dashboard is currently under development. We will be using our own API\u2019s to communicate with API's from multiple sources to answer your typical DYOR questions. On top of that, users will be able to check audits and doxxed devs, label wallets, track wallet movements, and get a security rating for any project\u2014and more! Our algorithms will create confidence scores for every project so you can make more informed investment decisions. With so many people being scammed daily in BSC (some of us included), we believe this will be a powerful tool to educate investors and deter scammers.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that sound like a much-needed service?

            "text": "Understanding the features and mechanics of marketing tools for ICO is not easy. We have prepared this post in order to answer some of the most asked questions and help you to understand ways how to promote your ICO.\n\n**Messengers**\n\nTelegram ban in Russia\n\nMost of the users will be unaffected, due to simply switching over and using VPN to gain access to the messenger. Based on our findings, we don't think that many users will leave Telegram, most likely it will be around 20&#37; of the entire audience. The most active and adequate ones will stay and continue using TG. If you have a TG channel, we advise continuing to maintain it as before, but also make a few other social media accounts, just in case. Also, do some analysis: if in a month your audience will get reduced to more than 30&#37;, then it makes sense to switch to other messengers. If the audience remains, then you can safely continue using Telegram.\n\n**What are the options for messengers?**\n\nIf you focus on the Russian market \\- Signal is a good option. For others, Discord, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Very soon, there will be a release of Join Chat \\- an instant messenger that will allow you to monetize content and manage the community, especially within the goals pursued in the ICO.\n\n**What other channels should the creators of ICO projects pay attention to?**\n\nFor publications \\- LJ is good but it seems to be more appropriate for generation X and is not longer popularly used. Tumblr and Medium can be used for content creation and consumption. We also suggest looking at the new marketing DMP and teaser grinds. At this point in time, collaborations with influencers and bloggers is rather bad than a good way of advertising. Reason being is that, they are putting a fairly large price tag for their services, compared to the actual results and conversions that you will get out of it, which doesn't make it a very attractive investment. We advise carefully choosing and building the relationship with the ones who are: selective \\(don't promote all paid ICO's or scams\\) and are genuinely interested in your project. The quality over quantity is the rule here. Also, do not forget the importance of using Facebook and Google and make them a priority.\n\n**Is the marketing of conventional start\\-ups different from the marketing of ICO projects?**\n\nYes, marketing of ICO\\-projects is more aggressive, short\\-term, changes quickly, unstable and you need to launch advertising campaigns simultaneously for many countries. For a regular project, marketing is focused on one, at most two or three countries. In ICO\\-marketing you need to react and act quickly. And there is an unspoken rule \\- if you're thinking about whether to do something or not in marketing ICO, then do it, otherwise there is a risk that the project will not get the needed hype or funding.\n\n**Is it worth collaborating with the media?**\n\nCooperation with the media is 100&#37; necessary. In the future, most likely, all the traditional forms of text will go to video, because the new generation is not used to reading. If your site does not create a lot of traffic, through the PR\\-publication, you can reach the target audience and use the targeted advertising tools to set up ads on Facebook. In addition, it is good to interact with the media in terms of partnerships. For example, we had a case, when one publication got to the 2nd place in the most asked questions. And a blog in the media with PR publications can seriously raise the conversion \\- by 50&#37; on average.\n\n**What are the main problems in covering a large number of countries?**\n\nAny team needs to have a Legal Advice \\- a consultation of lawyers, so that they give advice on certain legal norms, as the laws in all countries, because they are all different. If the laws are not respected, they can block the advertising. In addition, it is necessary to research how advertising works in each country, what are the patterns of behavior of people and so on. It should also be understood, that if we are advertising in a certain country, then it may not be suitable for the entire region. Therefore, before starting a campaign in another country, in order to increase the conversion, it is necessary to compile a psychological portrait of a potential user and to study his perceptions, habits, and cultural values.\n\n**How to identify and form your own audience?**\n\nContent marketing in this sense is very helpful, especially at a time when Facebook and Google are going to block direct advertising of all businesses related to cryptocurrency. In order to attract a good community, you need to sell the idea to them. Often, crypto sites are monotonous in their execution and can not sell their idea. The content or articles that are written and placed in the media, or on the blog, are able to meet this goal and sell the idea. The only peculiarity is that the normal community is much more complicated than the crypto community, who just want to get their profits \\(X\\) on the day of listing on the exchange. Based on our observations, 90&#37; of questions asked by community are along the lines of: \"When will the project be listed on the main exchanges? \". Although, we would hope that they would ask more information about the development or the roadmap, we need to accept, that most of the community are not fans of your product or idea, they simply want to make money on speculation asap.\n\n**There are many ways to grow a startup. How to know which strategy is the most appropriate for the project?**\n\nIf we are talking about the marketing strategy of a normal start\\-up, then first, we need to study and research the market, see if there are any analogues. If not, then ask yourself a fair question: \"Why? Why did no one in the world thought of such a thing? Were there any prerequisites for this? \". Then it is necessary to competently study all competitors, through SimilarWeb and find out the structure of their traffic, analyze the number of orders. Next, determine your target audience: what these people do, where they hang out, how they are interested in your project, whether these people are investing in your project. Then,, you need to locate yourself and your product properties on the matrix of competitors, differentiation features and how will you position yourself to your target market. And only after that it makes sense to test different channels, do hypotheses, you can find channels that are working for you and will help in scaling your project.\n\n**How to promote the project after the ICO and constantly maintain interest from investors? Is there life after ICO?**\n\nOf course there is life after the ICO. We advise you to have a good, professional community manager \\(or a few\\) who will take care of all the communication and relationship building with your investor community. Community managers are the direct contact and source of the company's news. These people must be always online or reachable, so that investors do not have any suspicions or doubts about your project. Plus, you need follow and adhere to your roadmap, in order to always deliver what you have promised to the community. We also suggest, to organize sessions with the founders \\(AMA's\\), send out newsletters and weekly/bi\\-weekly updates to keep in touch with the community. If you always keep investors informed, by making them feel involved and part of the project, your business will continue to grow and the interest of the community will remain after the ICO.  \n\n\nMore info: [13 STEPS TO ICO MARKETING](https://freegram.ca/ico-marketing-guide)",

And It's not about the apps in your phone to pay communal payment. I am talking about one that can give you an ability to earn and learn. One of the examples of such platforms is KYRREX.\n\nKyrrex has been in business for a number of years. It was created in the beginning as a worldwide ecosystem for investing and finance in general. Kyrrex's present vision is to bridge the gap between banking and cryptocurrencies through a collection of tools and new marketplace goods aimed at both parties.\n\nAccording to what I've seen, it's a well-established firm with industry expertise that relies on a devoted staff with banking and blockchain interests, so it would be a perfect place to start for the two sides to collaborate. If you work in the industry and have concerns about this, I encourage you to learn more about the project because you might get some good conclusions and ideas about it.\n\nIn addition, the Kyrrex ecosystem provides a one-stop shop for corporate, institutional and private professional clients through its advanced trading and custody technology based on its sophisticated and proprietary algorithms, allowing all types of trading to enjoy a secure economy. The best way to get convinced of my words is to test it on your own. According to my experience it is one of the most prospective exchanges with an inner tokenomics to avoid all types of fees and taxes as well.",

We hope you are all ready for this! \ud83e\udd29\n\n**But what is Hornhub? \ud83e\udd14**\n\nHornhub is an incredible project that bridges the gap between content creation and cryptocurrency \u26d3 and aims to become most revolutionary fan subscription platform in the world! \ud83c\udf0d\n\n**So how does it work? \ud83e\uddd0**\n\nUsing an intuitive, social-media-styled platform native to the Binance Smart Chain, the project will utilise its upcoming subscription-based website to allow content creators (known as \u2018Talents\u2019) to autonomously build and run their own hub, connect directly with fans, and securely and instantly earn for their original content. \ud83c\udf51\n\nThe project also incorporates a trio of fundamental utilities that link together to form the foundation of the company. \ud83e\uddf1\n\nFirstly, there is the subscription-based platform itself, which \u2013 due to its on-ramping of Fiat \u2013 requires no cryptocurrency knowledge for customers to use! Just a simple credit or debit card! \ud83d\udcb3\n\nAt the back end the site is directly connected to the second utility \u2013 the $HHUB cryptocurrency token. The payments buy these tokens for use on the site, but also grow the project at the same time! \ud83c\udf33\n\nThe third utility is the upcoming HornHub Marketplace, where NFTs can be bought, sold and traded by fans - all while earning royalties in perpetuity for the performers who minted them with the simple click of a button. \ud83d\uddb1\n\n**Want to know a little more? Check it out! \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffd**\n\n\ud83d\udc9d Charity wallet supports organisations fighting against sex trafficking\n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd HHub provides a safe environment for Talents to run their businesses freely and connect with their fans.\n\n\ud83c\udf51 Mega upcoming partnerships with highly respected and enviable models, actors influencers and artists.\n\n\ud83e\udde2 Sleek merchandise that is fresh and hot off the press.\n\n\ud83d\udd03 TRUE deflationary token (actual supply is reduced with every transaction)\n\n# \u2b50\ufe0f INFO:\n\n\ud83c\udf10Website: [https://www.hornhub.finance](https://www.hornhub.finance/)\n\n\ud83d\udceaTelegram: [https://t.me/HHUBfinance](https://t.me/HHUBfinance)\n\n\u270d\ufe0f Medium: [https://link.medium.com/X7OZ0L5urlb](https://link.medium.com/X7OZ0L5urlb)\n\n# Tokenomics:\n\n\u2764\ufe0f 3% True burn (removed from supply)\n\n\ud83c\udf70 3% Rewards\n\n\ud83d\udde3 5% Marketing\n\n\ud83d\ude07 1% Awareness/Charity\n\n\ud83d\ude80Total slippage: 12%\n\n\ud83d\udd13Liquidity locked\n\n\u2705Supply: 1,000,000,000 $HHUB\n\nSo join us at 5PM EST for a day of celebration and fun as HornHubs rockets past Uranus to the next level! \ud83d\ude80 Be there or be \ud83d\udfe6",

            "text": "In addition to member groups and governance, the Utrum ecosystem relies on several other functions for its operation. These include:\n\n# 1. OOT Tokens:-\nUtrum Tokens, called OOT tokens, are the cryptocurrency utility tokens used within the Utrum platform. As a utility, they are used by investors and other members to access in-depth technical analysis and market predictions. Members can use OOT to seek expert advice or buy and sell crypto-related services within the platform marketplace. Crypto developers can use OOT to make promotions. Contributors and members within Utrum also earn OOT tokens as rewards based on their contributions. Although OOT tokens are a utility token for use within the Utrum platform, OOT will also be able to be bought or sold outside the Utrum ecosystem on cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n# 2. Trust Factor Credits (TFC):-\nTrust Factor Credits, or TFC, are credits used exclusively within the Utrum platform. Members and contributors earn TFC for their predictions, analysis, and ratings. TFCs are used in calculating the appropriate OOT reward earned by an action.\n\n# 3. Trust Factor Score (TFS):-\nTrust Factor Score, or TFS, is a scoring system for translating community trust into a meaningful and measurable metric. A TFS is given to cryptocurrencies, ICOs, analysts and members. In simple terms, TFS reflects how many people in the community trust the information or member in question.\n\n# 4. Member Vote Coefficient (MVC):-\nAll contributors within the platform may participate in any rating process. Every member has a coefficient, which begins as 1 by default. The coefficient is used to determine the weight of the voter. This is calculated using the end result of the rating process. This dynamic coefficient changes after every rating process, according to the accuracy of the voter as compared with the crowd decision.\n\n# More Info: https://utrum.io\n\n",

We have previously worked on multiple teams assisting with marketing, listings, and community leadership positions, but we are now achieving our aspirations of operating our own business. We have responsibilities in several renowned cryptocurrency groups and decided it was time to unite all of our efforts and create something extraordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Panda Multiverse is first and foremost about its community and our commitment to helping one another, as well as our passion for Pandas!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAside from that, we are a reward token that pays out 1% BUSD to token holders and 4% BUSD to token holders who also own one of our BSC NFTs (with the ability to bridge the others).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are a cross-chain NFT platform that has an FPS P2E Zombie Panda game that rewards in legendary NFT pieces. We're also collaborating with other tokens to create their NFTs, giving further income and publicity back to the Panda multiverse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTokenomics\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2% LP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6% MARKETING\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHolders of 4% NFT in BUSD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2% NFT HOLDERS' WEEKLY PAYDAY\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1% DEV\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have announced a new collaboration with FarmerDoge!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe'll be creating their NFTs!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition, FarmerDoge will be cultivating Panda Multi-verse in the near future, which will bring us massive volume and new holders only from this collaboration!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe've also recently announced that each new investor who purchases a $50 minimum will receive a complimentary limited edition 8bit Panda NFT!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere else can you buy a tiny quantity of tokens and receive an NFT as a welcome gift?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPanda Multiverse is continually rewarding its fans with gifts and games based on our own Telegram and Discord communities!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur cross-chain NFT sales and ability to bridge them help us separate from other typical initiatives. And our FPS P2E Zombie Pandas game is on a completely different level of professionalism; it is nothing short of spectacular! This is a must-play for both gamers and crypto aficionados! Our game will include branding and marketing as though it were its own metaverse that changes over time. One of our more ambitious aims (you heard it here first) is to have a Panda multi-verse NFT Temple within the TCG metaverse. More specifics coming soon. We can't provide everything at once, and of course, our NFTs are hand-created masterpieces you can only acquire within the Panda multi-verse!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur initial 250 NFTs on BSC sold very quickly, leaving many people wanting more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, as we waited for our deal to be completed, we put an extra 250 on BSC, and they sold out even faster! We sold 550 NFTs in total in the run-up to our token launch, generating additional income for marketing and assisting with liquidity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are actively minting on SOL and searching for extra usefulness for SOL holders to profit from without needing to bridge back to BSC for incentives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition to NFT purchases, the Panda Multiverse will generate other revenue streams through our P2E game, in which players may spend in-game money and other projects can pay to advertise in-game (2 already on board). In addition, we will offer a line of personalized clothes and one-of-a-kind shoes to help generate marketing income for the project. In addition, our NFT artists will collaborate with other projects on their NFTs, generating more revenue for the Panda Multiverse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe're here to have a good time, trade beautiful art, form strong bonds, support the Pandas, and help one another grow as tall as the tallest bamboo!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"In an infinite multiverse, there is no such thing as fiction.\" PandaMultiverse\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[http://t.me/PandaMultiverse](http://t.me/PandaMultiverse)\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/panda-multiverse/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/panda-multiverse/)\n\n[http://www.pandamultiversenft.com](http://www.pandamultiversenft.com)",

You\u2019re probably wondering what makes Verify different than all of these other shilled posts, so allow me explain.\n\nCryptocurrency crimes rose by **1,000%** in the last year alone! According to the FTC, **consumers lost at least 80 million dollars** as a result. Guess who the consumers are\u2026us. And, nobody is stepping up to protect \u2018us\u2019 so there is a clear need for what Verify is doing!\n\n[Verify](https://www.verifytoken.net/) is bringing full transparency to the crypto market. **The utility behind Verify is Verify Lens.** It is a cloud-based dashboard that will gather data on defi projects\u2014new and old\u2014to aid the investor in making a more informed decision. The dashboard is currently under development. We will be using our own API\u2019s to communicate with API's from multiple sources to answer your typical DYOR questions. On top of that, users will be able to check audits and doxxed devs, label wallets, track wallet movements, and get a security rating for any project\u2014and more! Our algorithms will create confidence scores for every project so you can make more informed investment decisions. With so many people being scammed daily in BSC (some of us included), we believe this will be a powerful tool to educate investors and deter scammers.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that sound like a much-needed service? And you can get in on it early! **Join our** [Telegram](https://t.me/VerifyOfficial) **to get the details about how you can purchase!!!!**\n\nAt this point, you probably want to head over to our website to learn more about Verify Lens and see our timeline\u2014hope to see you for launch!\n\n[www.verifytoken.net](https://www.verifytoken.net/)\n\n(Boring but necessary and important stuff):\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Doxxed & experienced team**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Team is available around the clock for questions**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Active community**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Tokenomics with philanthropy**\n\n5% Buy tax\n\n5% Sell Tax\n\n2% R&D\n\n1% Liquidity\n\n1% Charity\n\n1% Burn\n\nGet in touch with us:\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/VerifyOfficial)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ver1fyToken?s=09)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/VerifyToken/)\n\n[Instagram](https://instagram.com/verify.token?utm_medium=copy_link)\n\n\u2026and of course [r/VerifyToken](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerifyToken/)\n\n**Come check out our Verify Family!

My referral id is bjcowen. Basically if we join on same team, our mining rate goes up. You can find the app in the AppStore by searching for pi network. Once they reach 1,000,000 miners, rewards are reduced. Currently they have 150,000 miners. Note this does not drain battery life. It\u2019s called cloud mining, not proof of work mining. Anyways happy cloud mining! Just takes one click a day to keep getting more tokens.",

There is one, sole focus to CURE - ending pediatric cancer first, then other chronic illnesses. \ud83d\udc89\n\nThe project is 100% community driven: Fair launched, locked and burned LP and team tokens. The project attracts long-term investors who believe in the infinite possibilities with bridging innovation of the cryptocurrency space with causes focused on supporting and ending childhood cancer - and that is just the start of this amazing journey \ud83d\uddfa\n\nVisit our website to see what we have in store long-term.

According to the FTC, **consumers lost at least 80 million dollars** as a result. Guess who the consumers are\u2026us. And, nobody is stepping up to protect \u2018us\u2019 so there is a clear need for what Verify is doing!\n\n[Verify](https://www.verifytoken.net/) is bringing full transparency to the crypto market. **The utility behind Verify is Verify Lens.** It is a cloud-based dashboard that will gather data on defi projects\u2014new and old\u2014to aid the investor in making a more informed decision. The dashboard is currently under development. We will be using our own API\u2019s to communicate with API's from multiple sources to answer your typical DYOR questions. On top of that, users will be able to check audits and doxxed devs, label wallets, track wallet movements, and get a security rating for any project\u2014and more! Our algorithms will create confidence scores for every project so you can make more informed investment decisions. With so many people being scammed daily in BSC (some of us included), we believe this will be a powerful tool to educate investors and deter scammers.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that sound like a much-needed service? And you can get in on it early! **Join our** [Telegram](https://t.me/VerifyOfficial) **to get the details about how you can purchase!!!!**\n\nAt this point, you probably want to head over to our website to learn more about Verify Lens and see our timeline\u2014hope to see you for launch!\n\n[www.verifytoken.net](https://www.verifytoken.net/)\n\n(Boring but necessary and important stuff):\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Doxxed & experienced team**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Team is available around the clock for questions**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Active community**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Tokenomics with philanthropy**\n\n5% Buy tax\n\n5% Sell Tax\n\n2% R&D\n\n1% Liquidity\n\n1% Charity\n\n1% Burn\n\nGet in touch with us:\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/VerifyOfficial)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ver1fyToken?s=09)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/VerifyToken/)\n\n[Instagram](https://instagram.com/verify.token?utm_medium=copy_link)\n\n\u2026and of course [r/VerifyToken](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerifyToken/)\n\n**Come check out our Verify Family!

            "text": "**Introducing Birb, A Multi-Use Token Designed To Reward Holders.**\n\nWelcome to Birb, a high deflationary defi token built on the Binance smart chain. Birb aims at becoming a highly usable token with multiple use cases.\n\n# Some of our current and upcoming features include:\n\n**Birb Game Portal**\n\nOur gaming portal will be live at launch and allow anyone to hatch for a chance to earn Birb tokens every day. The Top 250 holders will also have the opportunity to earn even more Birb by being able to claim extra rewards every 3 days. We believe holders should be rewarded nicely.\n\n**Flock Protocol**\n\nWith our upcoming BirbSwap, Birb will be the first multi-token swap platform with a built-in privacy feature called Flock Protocol. This will allow your transactions to be completely hidden.\n\n**BirbPay**\n\nOur eCommerce payment apps will allow online stores to accept $BIRB as a payment method. Accept payments and get paid quickly with absolutely no hidden transaction fees. You will be fully protected from online scammers and chargebacks. The seller and buyer's identity is also fully protected.\n\n**BirbSend**\n\nThis feature will allow you to send Birb tokens to anyone on most social media platforms such as YouTube, Telegram, Twitter, Discord, WeChat, WhatsApp, and more. Online streamers will also be able to accept Birb tokens as donations. Some of these will be powered by bots for example Telegram and others will be powered by a web and app-based platform that will allow you to send Birb tokens to someone via a password-protected Birb URL. When the receiver inputs their password they can claim their Birb tokens. It will be an advanced web app with a user-friendly design to make it fun and easy to send Birb tokens to your friends and loved ones.\n\n**BirbVote**\n\nOur upcoming voting platform will allow the community to vote on upcoming developments. Everyone that owns Birb will have the opportunity to voice their opinion and vote. The voting platform will be designed in a way that prevents abuse and gives everyone a fair chance.\n\n**BirbCharity**\n\nAs bird and animal lovers in general, we have decided to do recurring charity to help animals in need. All proceeds from our upcoming merchant store will be donated to select charities that the Birb community can vote on.\n\n**BirbLottery**\n\nThe upcoming Birb lottery is a fun way to earn a big amount of Birb tokens. Simply buy a lottery ticket and check if you\u2019re the lucky winner to hit the jackpot. The lottery will be done daily.\n\n**NFT Marketplace**\n\nThe upcoming Birb NFT marketplace will allow anyone to offer their artwork. People can then bid and purchase an NFT.

There are plenty of ways to use our cryptocurrency, and the number of use cases is only going to increase as the Amepay platform develops.\n\nAME represents decentralization, scalability, security (anonymity). We believe that our ecosystem is taking the industry to the next level. The main feature of our token and the project itself is its freedom from centralized control.\n\n**The key values of our project are:**\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Openness \u2013 all transactions are visible to any user;\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Anonymity \u2013 this factor benefits both private individuals and businesses. We are deeply convinced that in the modern world, businesses and private individuals have a right to privacy when it comes to their finance.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Decentralization \u2013 the most value in this aspect is how it eliminates the possibility of third-party tampering with your transactions. Today it\u2019s impossible to square up with anyone without involving a third party \u2013 unless you\u2019re using hard cash. In every other cashless transaction scenario you have to rely on a third party such as a bank, exchanger, dealer, broker, who not only keep back a hefty fee, but also have full access to all your transaction data.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Security \u2013 fiat money can be counterfeited. When it comes to cryptocurrency and the AME token, this is impossible \u2013 they can\u2019t be copied, hacked or counterfeited.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 This is far from the exhaustive list of the value our project and its digital money bring to the market.\n\n**Learn more about it on our website!** [amepay.io](https://amepay.io)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ol6mzs3cft51.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e6f57ec4ee892322e4dfc9f41b35790ad66264c",

            "text": "DAEX Blockchain\u00a0calls itself the most reliable of the clearing ecosystems for digital assets. The DAEX Ecosystem aims to deliver a more trustworthy and efficient trading environment for traders as well as exchanges. One of the goals of DAEX is separating trading and clearing into separate entities. The clearing chain will be the ecosystem\u2019s core product, and enterprises and traders will also be able to use the ecosystem\u2019s multi-asset wallet.\n\nThe foundation chairman of DAEX is Benjamin Gu. Hana Zhang is a co-founder and another company leader. The Lois Shen is COO, Jason Tang is the chief architect, and Stone Zhou is the wallet architecture scientist.\n\nDAEX is already working with six exchanges, including LBank, BCEX, AllCoin, Indodax, SD, and Tokenomy.\n\n# Why Is DAEX Necessary?\n\nThe team behind the project created DAEX in response to the growth of cryptocurrency, which led to an increase in demand for convenience and safety in digital transaction transactions. Traditional centralized exchanges are popular thanks to their liquidity, fast transaction speeds, and intuitive user interfaces. However, the clearing services and trading occur in a centralized environment while they stay in control of customer assets. That infrastructure results in vulnerabilities to internal fraud and hacking attempts.\n\nDAEX began with the goal of resolving those issues of centralized exchanges with smart contracts and distributed ledger technology. This allows for transparency for both traders and exchanges. The resulting infrastructure lets traders stay in control of their own assets and offers the benefits of clearing on a public chain.\n\n# How Does DAEX Work?\n\nThe clearing solution offered by DAEX for centralized cryptocurrency exchanges is based on the distributed ledger technology. Rules for both settlements and clearing are preprogrammed into the clearing smart contracts found on the clearing chain. The process of clearing is completely automatic without any human interference. To further guarantee objectivity during clearing, DAEX uses a well-thought-out consensus mechanism on its clearing chain. For added transparency, the digital assets that customers store on DAEX are registered and then stored on the DAEX clearing chain. It is impossible for any other individuals or institutions to access assets without the permission of the asset owner.\n\n# What Are the Values of DAEX?\n\nOne of the core values of DAEX is security, with a secure blockchain. All assets registered within the DAEX ecosystem have a joint custodian organizational system, and the DAEX wallet features a multilevel encryption mechanism.\n\nDAEX also strongly values transparency, and it can deliver transparent accounting information thanks to its structure as a public clearing chain instead of a private one. This lets everyone witness and share the benefits of the clearing ecosystem from DAEX.\n\nFinally, DAEX embraces openness by delivering an open ecosystem that supports clearing and trading. The infrastructure of the DAEX ecosystem also supports the possibility of future business in derivatives, allowing for expansion in an open matter.\n\nMore Info: https://daex.io ",

In turn, this lack of use case will ultimately lead to very little incentive for investors to continue holding.\n\n\ud83d\udca0 The PYRO token has been designed to carry a number of different utilities in order to enable long term sustainability.

Verify Lens is not a gimmick and it will help each and every investor in various ways!\n\nLet me introduce you to the ICO of 2021, [r/VerifyToken](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerifyToken/)! You\u2019re probably wondering what makes Verify different than all of these other shilled posts, so allow me explain.\n\nCryptocurrency crimes rose by **1,000%** in the last year alone! According to the FTC, **consumers lost at least 80 million dollars** as a result. Guess who the consumers are\u2026us. And, nobody is stepping up to protect \u2018us\u2019 so there is a clear need for what Verify is doing!\n\n[Verify](https://www.verifytoken.net/) is bringing full transparency to the crypto market. **The utility behind Verify is Verify Lens.** It is a cloud-based dashboard that will gather data on defi projects\u2014new and old\u2014to aid the investor in making a more informed decision. The dashboard is currently under development. We will be using our own API\u2019s to communicate with API's from multiple sources to answer your typical DYOR questions. On top of that, users will be able to check audits and doxxed devs, label wallets, track wallet movements, and get a security rating for any project\u2014and more! Our algorithms will create confidence scores for every project so you can make more informed investment decisions. With so many people being scammed daily in BSC (some of us included), we believe this will be a powerful tool to educate investors and deter scammers.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that sound like a much-needed service? And you can get in on it early! **Join our** [Telegram](https://t.me/VerifyOfficial) **to get the details about how you can purchase!!!!**\n\nAt this point, you probably want to head over to our website to learn more about Verify Lens and see our timeline\u2014hope to see you for launch!\n\n[www.verifytoken.net](https://www.verifytoken.net/)\n\n(Boring but necessary and important stuff):\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Doxxed & experienced team**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Team is available around the clock for questions**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Active community**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Tokenomics with philanthropy**\n\n5% Buy tax\n\n5% Sell Tax\n\n2% R&D\n\n1% Liquidity\n\n1% Charity\n\n1% Burn\n\nGet in touch with us:\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/VerifyOfficial)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ver1fyToken?s=09)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/VerifyToken/)\n\n[Instagram](https://instagram.com/verify.token?utm_medium=copy_link)\n\n\u2026and of course [r/VerifyToken](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerifyToken/)\n\n**Come check out our Verify Family!

The right application of these technologies\u200a\u2014\u200aby a team who know how to design for families and children\u200a\u2014\u200acan deliver a service far more efficient than the banking network. (This year global researchers Gartner moved cryptocurrencies to \u2018phase 4\u2019 of their Hype Cycle\u200a\u2014\u200apast the tricky stages of overinflated expectations and subsequent disappointment to the \u2018Slope of Enlightenment\u2019, en route to mainstream acceptance.) They can solve the challenge that the banking system is not solving itself.\n\nPigzbe ticks every box in terms of immediate, frictionless, \u2018microfinancing\u2019 transfers at almost no cost.",

AstroMiners NFT, through their collaboration with Justdiggit - a grassroots organization fighting global warming by re-greening Africa - will be donating one Water Bund for every of its NFT sold, bringing greenery back to places affected by increased temperatures and overfarming. With this, you will be replenishing the depleting Earth\u2019s resources, preventing an eventual collapse from overtaking our future and that of coming generations.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nThere has been a proliferation of various NFT projects promising different roadmaps and utilities. NFT investors should be careful on any NFT project they choose to invest in to not fall for scam projects.  Investors are advised to confirm the rarity of the NFT project they intend to invest in and that the team promoting it is fully doxxed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.com/invite/astrominers](https://discord.com/invite/astrominers)\n\nWebsite: [https://astrominers.io/](https://astrominers.io/)\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/AstrominersNFT](https://twitter.com/AstrominersNFT)\n\nInstagram: [https://www.instagram.com/astrominersnft/](https://www.instagram.com/astrominersnft/)",

To find proof of how popular cryptocurrency really is, one doesn\u2019t have to look too far! A recent study by Chainalysis, a crypto analytics company, has shown that Ukrainians and Russians are the most active cryptocurrency users in the world. Leading the list are: Ukraine with its first place, Russia comes second, Venezuela \u2013 third. The top-10 countries when it comes to cryptocurrency activity are China, Kenya, the US, South Africa, Nigeria, Colombia and Vietnam. To make the study as objective as possible, researchers looked at population size, the country\u2019s economic performance, as well as the amount of digital assets \n\n\\- transacted per capita;\n\n\\- cryptocurrency holdings;\n\n\\- retail and p2p transactions worth over $10,000, calculated against purchasing power parity.\n\nYou may have guessed it already, but Afghanistan, Algeria, Cape Verde, Chad, Fiji, Laos, Libya, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, The West Bank, Gaza Strip and Zimbabwe were awarded with zero points.\n\nWe hope that our project will be able to boost cryptocurrency development even further and help countries at the bottom of the list to adopt digital assets sooner!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qa4d6cyxq9q51.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bcc1b184c0a99839e60d8b5ab4e19684dc0167a",

Verify Lens is not a gimmick and it will help each and every investor in various ways!\n\nLet me introduce you to the ICO of 2021, [r/VerifyToken](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerifyToken/)! You\u2019re probably wondering what makes Verify different than all of these other shilled posts, so allow me explain.\n\nCryptocurrency crimes rose by **1,000%** in the last year alone! According to the FTC, **consumers lost at least 80 million dollars** as a result. Guess who the consumers are\u2026us. And, nobody is stepping up to protect \u2018us\u2019 so there is a clear need for what Verify is doing!\n\n[Verify](https://www.verifytoken.net/) is bringing full transparency to the crypto market. **The utility behind Verify is Verify Lens.** It is a cloud-based dashboard that will gather data on defi projects\u2014new and old\u2014to aid the investor in making a more informed decision. The dashboard is currently under development. We will be using our own API\u2019s to communicate with API's from multiple sources to answer your typical DYOR questions. On top of that, users will be able to check audits and doxxed devs, label wallets, track wallet movements, and get a security rating for any project\u2014and more! Our algorithms will create confidence scores for every project so you can make more informed investment decisions. With so many people being scammed daily in BSC (some of us included), we believe this will be a powerful tool to educate investors and deter scammers.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that sound like a much-needed service?

Imagine Uniswap mixed with Tornado Cash. They have a team of 6 developers working exclusively on the DEX.\n\nFinancial institutions, high-net-worth individuals, and your average crypto holders want increased privacy when it comes to trading cryptocurrency.\n\n$CIA will be solving that problem with its new multi-chain privacy DEX built to be THE choice for projects, liquidity providers, whales, VC funds & privacy-conscious traders across the dominating EVM L1 chains.\n\nPrivacy is always paramount in crypto. It will enable the $CIA token to thrive in bull and bear markets. Demand for the DEX is expected to be high which will, in turn, cause the price of the $CIA token to rise significantly.\n\nThe project is currently flying under the radar. This is due to change shortly with mass marketing campaigns paid for by the tokens well planned out tokenomics.\n\nThe DEX is due to be released in Q2 this year.\n\nPlease feel free to come and visit us. We are happy to answer any questions you may have.\n\n$CIA token is available to buy on Uniswap.\n\nLiquidity locked for 100 years\n\nListed on CG + CMC\n\nStrong community rising daily\n\nWhitepaper released and available on the website\n\nContract: 0x52F4D5EE6c91e01Be67CA1F64b11eD0EE370817d\n\nWebsite: [http://www.ciaprotocol.com](http://www.ciaprotocol.com/) \n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/CIAProtocol\\_Official](https://t.me/CIAProtocol_Official) \n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/CIAProtocol](https://twitter.com/CIAProtocol)",

CHIMP will also be the base currency denomination in the Chimpion Store, which will feature our exclusive apparel product line along with gift cards from major retailers and merchants from the Chimpion directory.\n\nBanana Token (BNANA) is the reward layer of the Chimpion ecosystem. BNANA is earned through purchases from Chimpion merchants using CHIMP or any other cryptocurrency. BNANA functions like points on a loyalty card, which can be redeemed for promotional offers, discounts, and exclusive products.\n\nCoin Specifications\n\nChimpion is hosted on the EOS blockchain using Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). DPoiS, a method invented by Dan Larimer, resolves many of the problems seen in Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems. In a DPoS system, a technological democracy is created by a community of block producers and staked users that agree to a certain set of rules.\n\nDPoS and PoS are two different protocols; in a PoS system, every wallet that contains coins is able to participate in process of validating transactions and forming consensus, thus the more coins in your wallet, the more coins you will eventually receive. With DPoS system every wallet that contains coins is able to vote for representatives. These representatives validate transactions and form consensus, and are paid for their efforts through the system. This avoids a pitfall of PoS, which is that, just like in PoW, consolidation will eventually occur.\n\nFor more information, kindly visit:\n\nWebsite: https://www.chimpion.io/\n\nWhitepaper: https://www.chimpion.io/whitepaper/\n\nBounty0x Username: sprintx24",

            "text": "In short: [Wono.io](http://wono.io/) is a freelance exchange that's implementing its token soon. It's a fast growing community of freelancers and employers that already has 518,000+ users registered on the platform. The token will be used to pay for the platform services. Of course, freelancers and investors may stake or exchange coins, making profit on them. (Waiting list registration started at -[ ](https://token.wono.io/?fbclid=IwAR2tPWfBHGYwL9x_N8sK62ocIhylvSAVJwEQc_p2Oa2aKtej8l99oc7g4YM)[https://token.wono.io/](https://token.wono.io/)).\n\nThe Wono token has \"to-the-moon\" potential and is likely to make X1000+ profit. Here's why:  \n   1) **Pioneer.** Wono is the first freelance exchange, implementing cryptocurrency. Their competitors do not use crypto. After all the project's goals are fully integrated, Wono would be the first freelance exchange in the world, using crypto as the payment between freelancers and customers. By the way, in the US, [38%](https://www.ccn.com/38-of-freelancers-regularly-use-cryptocurrency-survey-reveals/) freelancers already admitted they would like to get paid in crypto. This project would be the first in the market, and it's likely that the token's price would go high.   \n   2) **NFT-certification.** The Wono tokens have NFT-certification. That means a freelancer may upload his CV or qualification certificates that would be approved by the platform, giving more rating to a freelancer. This creates trust between a freelancer and an employer who wants to hire a qualified professional. Trust is one of the most important things in the freelance industry. As a result, more people will be interested in the platform, and more people would be willing to pay for the trust, safety and brilliant specialists. As the platform grows bigger, so does the token price.  \n   3) [**Huobi**](https://www.huobi.com/en-us/) **listing.** The tokens will be listed on Huobi. It's the third best cryptocurrency exchange in the world  after [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) and [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/). It has 10+ mln users. Huobi supports the Wono project and recently they have started implementing a common crypto-wallet for tokens and other coins. Such support from a big crypto-exchange is a strong factor, indicating that the token price will go up.\n\n   So, the Wono project has the prospect to \"get over the moon\" and bring investors X1000 profit. Mainly, because of its idea and a global trend potential, as more people are going freelance now. Getting tokens ahead of time, before using them for freelance exchange transactions, and before it all gets \"mainstream\" is a good investment and an opportunity that Wono offers. Of course, the final choice whether to buy tokens or not is up to a user. This is just a recommendation.",

World establishments have failed people in need for too long - we must take things into our own hands. Furthermore, cryptocurrency was created to fight back against the establishment, yet it is now big corporations that dominate it.\n\n\ud83d\udca0 The holder has been neglected. Our brand has been built to enable synergy between the commercial and crypto world, with the invention of new products and characters that generate commercial revenue, with a portion of that going directly to PYRO holders via market buybacks, profit sharing and token burns.\n\n\ud83d\udca0 Pyromaniac doesn\u2019t just donate, we actively help. In addition to charity donations, Pyromaniac will hold events, learning activities and food handouts to those most in need.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udca0 Token utility is essential for a cryptocurrency\u2019s long term ambitions.\n\n\ud83d\udca0 Many launch without clear utility and thus are simply an investment vehicle with no inherent value. In turn, this lack of use case will ultimately lead to very little incentive for investors to continue holding.\n\n\ud83d\udca0 The PYRO token has been designed to carry a number of different utilities in order to enable long term sustainability. Upon launch, the lottery, charity and reflection utilities will be implemented, with profit sharing, launchpad and in-app purchases coming as the project develops further.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 PUBLIC PRE-SALE:**\n\nTokens per BNB - TBC\n\n\u2705 13th August = 6pm BST\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 PANCAKE SWAP LAUNCH:**\n\nTokens per BNB - TBC\n\n\u2705 14th August = 6pm BST\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udc33 ANTI-WHALE TOKENOMICS FOR THE FIRST 15 MINUTES\n\n\ud83d\udce3 DOXXED TEAM\n\n\ud83e\udd16 ANTI BOT MEASURES\n\n\u2705 WHITEPAPER\n\n\u2705  LIVE AMA\n\n* \ud83d\udd25Website:  [www.pyromaniac.io](https://www.pyromaniac.io/)\n* \ud83d\udd25Telegram:  [https://t.me/PyromaniacOfficial](https://t.me/PyromaniacOfficial)\n* \ud83d\udd25Twitter: [https://twitter.com/Pyro\\_Tweets](https://twitter.com/Pyro_Tweets)\n* \ud83d\udd25Whitepaper :  [https://b5fca6af-4af1-4f01-9d66-9c034361f645.filesusr.com/ugd/99a893\\_bba54f2fcf124ff8b39f9fef8bde6c88.pdf](https://b5fca6af-4af1-4f01-9d66-9c034361f645.filesusr.com/ugd/99a893_bba54f2fcf124ff8b39f9fef8bde6c88.pdf)\n\n**\\*Be sure to DYOR before jumping into any project , many SCAMS out there, use only official links!!!**",

You\u2019re probably wondering what makes Verify different than all of these other shilled posts, so allow me explain.\n\nCryptocurrency crimes rose by **1,000%** in the last year alone! According to the FTC, **consumers lost at least 80 million dollars** as a result. Guess who the consumers are\u2026us. And, nobody is stepping up to protect \u2018us\u2019 so there is a clear need for what Verify is doing!\n\n[Verify](https://www.verifytoken.net/) is bringing full transparency to the crypto market. **The utility behind Verify is Verify Lens.** It is a cloud-based dashboard that will gather data on defi projects\u2014new and old\u2014to aid the investor in making a more informed decision. The dashboard is currently under development. We will be using our own API\u2019s to communicate with API's from multiple sources to answer your typical DYOR questions. On top of that, users will be able to check audits and doxxed devs, label wallets, track wallet movements, and get a security rating for any project\u2014and more! Our algorithms will create confidence scores for every project so you can make more informed investment decisions. With so many people being scammed daily in BSC (some of us included), we believe this will be a powerful tool to educate investors and deter scammers.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that sound like a much-needed service?

Verify Lens is not a gimmick and it will help each and every investor in various ways!\n\nLet me introduce you to the ICO of 2021, [r/VerifyToken](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerifyToken/)! You\u2019re probably wondering what makes Verify different than all of these other shilled posts, so allow me explain.\n\nCryptocurrency crimes rose by **1,000%** in the last year alone! According to the FTC, **consumers lost at least 80 million dollars** as a result. Guess who the consumers are\u2026us. And, nobody is stepping up to protect \u2018us\u2019 so there is a clear need for what Verify is doing!\n\n[Verify](https://www.verifytoken.net/) is bringing full transparency to the crypto market. **The utility behind Verify is Verify Lens.** It is a cloud-based dashboard that will gather data on defi projects\u2014new and old\u2014to aid the investor in making a more informed decision. The dashboard is currently under development. We will be using our own API\u2019s to communicate with API's from multiple sources to answer your typical DYOR questions. On top of that, users will be able to check audits and doxxed devs, label wallets, track wallet movements, and get a security rating for any project\u2014and more! Our algorithms will create confidence scores for every project so you can make more informed investment decisions. With so many people being scammed daily in BSC (some of us included), we believe this will be a powerful tool to educate investors and deter scammers.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that sound like a much-needed service? And you can get in on it early! **Join our** [Telegram](https://t.me/VerifyOfficial) **to get the details about how you can purchase!!!!**\n\nAt this point, you probably want to head over to our website to learn more about Verify Lens and see our timeline\u2014hope to see you soon!\n\n[www.verifytoken.net](https://www.verifytoken.net/)\n\n(Boring but necessary and important stuff):\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Doxxed & experienced team**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Team is available around the clock for questions**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Active community**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Tokenomics with philanthropy**\n\n**\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25**\n\n**10% Sell tax**\n\n\ud83d\udca5 2% Research and Development\n\n\ud83d\udca5 2% Charity\n\n\ud83d\udca5 2% Liquidity\n\n\ud83d\udca5 2% Burn\n\n\ud83d\udca5 ***2% BNB DIVIDEND*** **\ud83d\udca5**\n\n**6% Buy Tax**\n\n\ud83d\udca5 2% R&D\n\n\ud83d\udca5 1% Liquidity\n\n\ud83d\udca5 1% Charity\n\n\ud83d\udca5 1% Burn\n\n\ud83d\udca5 ***1% BNB DIVIDEND*** **\ud83d\udca5**\n\nGet in touch with us:\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/VerifyOfficial)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ver1fyToken?s=09)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/VerifyToken/)\n\n[Instagram](https://instagram.com/verify.token?utm_medium=copy_link)\n\n\u2026and of course [r/VerifyToken](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerifyToken/)\n\n**Come check out our Verify Family!

The word is incredibly like IPO or Initial Public Offering. As similar to an IPO and an ICO is primarily crowdfunding.\n\nIn an IPO, a corporation offers equity within the company instead of cash from the general public.\n\nIn the case of ICOs, a blockchain company additionally makes an attempt to raise funds by providing tokens to its early investors. In spite of that, the term ICO is restricted to the general public offerings which have been created by blockchain network.\n\nTerraGreen is based on a blockchain network and this network would produce a TerraGreen coin which will be directly met through an ICO.\n\nIn this TerragGreen, the company would not raise capital from venture money, although it would raise the general public for the money so that their product would roll. It\u2019s a perfect manner to get involved with the TerragGreen and also gathering funds from the people.\n\nOn the other hand, like IPOs, ICO\u2019s don\u2019t seem to be very giving out the authority of the corporate via these coins. They simply offer tokens or cryptocurrencies of that platform.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f For what reason do individuals acknowledge these tokens at ICOs?\n\nWhen adding to an ICO, the financial investors would take a gander at the developer\u2019s profile who is building the product and furthermore the development capability of their application. As a matter of first importance, an outstanding software engineer will, most likely, create a decent product. Furthermore, the financial investor envisions that the project would generate more eagerness for the future in view of the proper solution for it gives to different issues.\n\nAll things considered, the estimation of the tokens they hold will go at the top, after some time. In particular, these financial investors get a lot of profits with these tokens.\n\nThey get them for pennies. It is the organization\u2019s system for encouraging its initial financial investors and pulling in more people to their ICO\u2019s.\n\nIn this way, in its exposed terms, these financial investors are taking pure faith that the token esteem will rise and they will have the capacity to gain more amount of returns.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f What about the returns been seen from the ICO?\n\nWell, this is one of the important questions which all are eager to know. TerraGreen is the most in cryptocurrency trend which is acknowledged by today\u2019s world. But due to its limited amount of token generation, it is not in everybody\u2019s reach today. It is 0.1 USD in today\u2019s trend and it would rise to its maxes more than anyone could imagine. If you invest 200 USD now, it\u2019s gonna stretch to its crest. The investors are keeping on hold for 1\u20132 year least for the huge amounting of returns from the [TerragGreen ICO](https://ico.terragreen.io/).\n\nIt is incredible how this investment quickly shows up the returns. Any investor could never find such return like TerraGreen coin ICO. There are people who would have still made digital money after buying [TerragGreen coin](https://terragreen.io/) through trades. Yet the ICO investors got the best deals.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0fI would simplify more about ICO\n\nWell, Digital currencies are making tycoons, even very rich people today. Indeed, even individuals who are purchasing cryptocurrencies from trades can make a huge profit. ICOs are the one where everything starts. With a little exertion, you may have the capacity to perceive the triumphant activities in the bud. Do not wait till extent, where cryptocurrency to be a major headline in the newspaper. That is really an opportunity to sell.\n\nDo your exploration and discover the task worth investing by yourself. Without a doubt, you are taking a risk with an ICO. Be that as it may, regardless of whether you are appropriate about only one of the projects, at that point you are taking a gander at profiting on the cryptocurrency markets.",

It seems like a weekly event where thieves can access and steal funds from these entities, with stolen amounts ranging from hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nSimilar to a bank, this centralized entity has complete control over funds when a trader makes a deposit on the exchange. They also act as clearing houses that provide order matching, clearing and settlement services. With this infrastructure, traders must fully trust the exchange to not only keep their assets safely from external and internal threats, but also facilitate the trade that occurs. The hot wallet they use to store their customer's digital assets allows hacking.\n\nDAEX wallet\nsupports many assets, which are accessed using multi-segment keys.\nDouble encryption keeps your wallet safe and protected.

According to the FTC, **consumers lost at least 80 million dollars** as a result. Guess who the consumers are\u2026us. And, nobody is stepping up to protect \u2018us\u2019 so there is a clear need for what Verify is doing!\n\n[Verify](https://www.verifytoken.net/) is bringing full transparency to the crypto market. **The utility behind Verify is Verify Lens.** It is a cloud-based dashboard that will gather data on defi projects\u2014new and old\u2014to aid the investor in making a more informed decision. The dashboard is currently under development. We will be using our own API\u2019s to communicate with API's from multiple sources to answer your typical DYOR questions. On top of that, users will be able to check audits and doxxed devs, label wallets, track wallet movements, and get a security rating for any project\u2014and more! Our algorithms will create confidence scores for every project so you can make more informed investment decisions. With so many people being scammed daily in BSC (some of us included), we believe this will be a powerful tool to educate investors and deter scammers.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that sound like a much-needed service?

Using Link, a developer can create  classic, conventional web-based APIs for any smart contract written on a  programmatic blockchain. At the heart of Link is BLINK, the utility  token which provides Link users with API transaction capacity.\n\nLaunched  with the ambitious goal of building a privacy-focused form of cloud  computing powered by blockchain technology, Oasis continues to attract a  high level of attention. In mid-2018, Oasis closed a $45 million  investment round led by a16z crypto, Accel, Binance DCVC (Data  Collective), Electric Capital, Foundation Capital, Metastable, Pantera,  Polychain, and others. In late 2018, Oasis launched the Oasis Devnet, an  environment for developers to test and build on the Oasis platform.\n\n\"Professor  (Dawn) Song and the Oasis team have quickly scaled with an ambitious  development agenda and are on track to significantly innovate the  privacy component of blockchain technology,\" said Michael Chin, Chief  Executive Officer of Blockmason. \"We are confident that Oasis' approach  to confidential smart contracts will prove an industry leader, and we  are excited to help enable developers to build Oasis-powered apps.\"\n\nLink  is viewed as the missing component in blockchain-based app development.  With Link, developers and users alike can interact with smart contracts  like any other web API. There are no \"gas\" cryptocurrencies to acquire,  browser plugins to install or other unnecessary hurdles. There's also  no servers or web infrastructure to maintain or monitor. A developer  simply adds the smart contracts they want to use in their app to Link.  Once added, they can read from and write to these smart contracts just  like any other API.",

            "text": "\nFor a trader, growing assets is rewarding, but uncertain, due to a fundamental lack of information needed for successful trades. Related problems can be improved with the AiBB platform. This is because information accountability and having the necessary tools brings confidence to new traders and grows the market organically.\n\nSOME CONTRIBUTING ISSUES TO THESE PROBLEMS:\n\nPrice volatility happens in two circumstances: first, when there is a lack of accurate assessment of the underlying value of a security and second: where there is a lack of market depth.Prior to even buying crypto, people have a notion that because there is no physical element to it, they can not convert it into hard cash in their bank account. And they\u2019re partially right! The process to fund crypto is to wire transfer (3\u20135 business days), e-transfer (instant usually) or use a credit card (limited amounts) to send your money to a 3rd party broker or crypto institute. To withdraw you need to wait a minimum of 5 days for it to hit your bank account. We fix this by partnering with various exchanges and acquiring an EML (electronic money license) to convert crypto to FIAT on the application easily and faster than ever before.\n\nTHE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS BY AIBB\n\n1.POOR VALUATION OF MARKETS, It\u2019s difficult to properly value investments in a brand new space. Fear of overvaluation must be met with reliable data. Early adopters navigated their way through these markets with limited tools and resources. They were self-educated and their investment transactions were made based on speculation and emotion rather than calculated, informed and educated decisions.\n\n2.TOKEN LOSS AND TRANSFER TIMETransferring cryptocurrencies remain stressful with a large margin of error. Users can check and recheck the address, but one wrong character and assets could be sent to an unknown contact.MISINFORMATION The current ICO market often relies on the intelligent evaluation of a future product. Most companies lack a product, the technology, a proper team or a vetted revenue model, and many are raising money based only on a white paper alone. This model has allowed very astute early adopters to thrive but is not conducive to growing interest and investment in cryptocurrencies. The market should be driven by promise, not fear.\n\n3.FRAGMENTATION An unintended ramification of decentralization is fragmentation, where market information is published in multiple places by multiple people at multiple times and isn\u2019t always correct or up-to-the-minute. Decentralized markets must rely on authorities that can assess all the fragments and make that information accessible to all, this transparency is a benefit if the centralized library is trustworthy.\n\nhttps://aibb.io",

Artificial intelligence plays an important role in the analysis of the reliability of the data. This will save time for customers to find useful and valuable information. \n\n\\- Level of exchange: This level has a connection with many cryptocurrency exchanges, which ultimately can facilitate trading. He also collects data from various sources and combines them into a single database, so trading in cryptoactive assets does not require direct interaction with other exchanges, everything happens through the AiBB application. This provides users with the best prices for assets through the analysis of many exchanges. \n\n\\- Application level: This level is the most important component of the AiBB system, which has the property of a stand-alone application that cannot be connected to external connections for full-fledged work, but at the same time it tends to connect to many data points to obtain the necessary information. This level directly draws information from other levels of the AiBB system to ensure the execution of transactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVisit [https://aibb.io](https://aibb.io) to know more",

Verify Lens is not a gimmick and it will help each and every investor in various ways!\n\nLet me introduce you to the ICO of 2021, [r/VerifyToken](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerifyToken/)! You\u2019re probably wondering what makes Verify different than all of these other shilled posts, so allow me explain.\n\nCryptocurrency crimes rose by **1,000%** in the last year alone! According to the FTC, **consumers lost at least 80 million dollars** as a result. Guess who the consumers are\u2026us. And, nobody is stepping up to protect \u2018us\u2019 so there is a clear need for what Verify is doing!\n\n[Verify](https://www.verifytoken.net/) is bringing full transparency to the crypto market. **The utility behind Verify is Verify Lens.** It is a cloud-based dashboard that will gather data on defi projects\u2014new and old\u2014to aid the investor in making a more informed decision. The dashboard is currently under development. We will be using our own API\u2019s to communicate with API's from multiple sources to answer your typical DYOR questions. On top of that, users will be able to check audits and doxxed devs, label wallets, track wallet movements, and get a security rating for any project\u2014and more! Our algorithms will create confidence scores for every project so you can make more informed investment decisions. With so many people being scammed daily in BSC (some of us included), we believe this will be a powerful tool to educate investors and deter scammers.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that sound like a much-needed service? And you can get in on it early! **Join our** [Telegram](https://t.me/VerifyOfficial) **to get the details about how you can purchase!!!!**\n\nAt this point, you probably want to head over to our website to learn more about Verify Lens and see our timeline\u2014hope to see you for launch!\n\n[www.verifytoken.net](https://www.verifytoken.net/)\n\n(Boring but necessary and important stuff):\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Doxxed & experienced team**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Team is available around the clock for questions**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Active community**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Tokenomics with philanthropy**\n\n5% Buy tax\n\n5% Sell Tax\n\n2% R&D\n\n1% Liquidity\n\n1% Charity\n\n1% Burn\n\nGet in touch with us:\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/VerifyOfficial)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ver1fyToken?s=09)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/VerifyToken/)\n\n[Instagram](https://instagram.com/verify.token?utm_medium=copy_link)\n\n\u2026and of course [r/VerifyToken](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerifyToken/)\n\n**Come check out our Verify Family!

Javvy approaches cryptocurrency from a compliance and regulation-first perspective, and is powered by a team with decades of extensive regulatory, compliance, programming, and security experience. The cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy.\n\nAs a result, lack of information and the absence of easily-identifiable best practices, has led crypto users to resort to combining feature-poor, and often insecure, crypto utilities to obtain and manage their cryptocurrency. We, the Javvy team, decided that there is a better way. We are consolidating the full functionality of cryptocurrency into a previously nonexistent, comprehensive solution with a focus on security, simplicity, and keeping the control of cryptocurrency where it belongs, in the hands of its owners\n\n[https://javvy.com/](https://javvy.com/)",

The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.\n* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.\n* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.\n* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.\n* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.\n\n**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**\n\nElonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.\n\nIn Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.\n\nRockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.\n\nIf you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.\n\nCrypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.\n\n**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**\n\n* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!\n* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.\n* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.\n\n**Liquidity locked for 100 years**\n\nThe Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.\n\nHe did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.\n\n**13700 holders and rising**\n\nElonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.\n\nWith the project we are building it is easy to see why.\n\n**Low market cap**\n\nAt the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.\n\nWe are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.\n\nNow is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\n2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.\n\nIt pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.\n\n**Info**\n\n* AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released in Q1 this year\n* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap, Hotbit, and Whitebit\n* Liquidity locked for 100 years\n* Listed on CG + CMC\n* Strong community rising daily\n* Whitepaper released and available on the website\n* Contract: 0x97b65710d03e12775189f0d113202cc1443b0aa2\n\n**Links**\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Dextools: [https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b](https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b)\n\n\ud83d\udde3Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share](https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share)\n\n\ud83d\udcf1Telegram: [https://t.me/astro\\_elon](https://t.me/astro_elon)\n\n\ud83e\udd1dAudit: [https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/](https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/)\n\n\ud83d\udd10Liquidity Lock: [https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE](https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE)\n\n\ud83d\udcbbDiscord: [https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf](https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf)\n\n\ud83e\udd8eCoinGecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon](https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon)\n\n\ud83d\udd17CoinMarketCap: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/)\n\n\ud83c\udf0eWebsite: [https://astroelon.net/](https://astroelon.net/)\n\n\ud83d\udc26Twitter: [https://twitter.com/AstroElon](https://twitter.com/AstroElon)\n\n\ud83d\udcacTG Announcements: [https://t.me/astroelonannouncements](https://t.me/astroelonannouncements)",

Example: 0.1 Eth = 1 entry and 1 Eth = 10 entries. Entries made *AFTER* the time of this post are included.\n\n\\*Draw will be made on Saturday 16th April live on VC.\n\n\\*\\*You must also NOT sell any Elonone before the draw to qualify.\n\n\\*\\*\\*You can enter as many times as you like. Good luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ABOUT THE TOKEN:**\n\n **$ELONONE** is a utility token that powers a revolutionary new gasless NFT marketplace and a play to earn crypto racing game.\n\n* Gasless NFT Marketplace called AstroZero.\n* Play 2 Earn crypto racing game called Rocket Dash\n* Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply!\n* Liquidity locked for 100 years.\n* 13700 holders and rising.\n* Low market cap.\n\n**Gasless NFT Marketplace**\n\nElonone will be the token that powers the revolutionary upcoming gasless NFT marketplace called AstroZero. This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.\n\nAstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.\n\nWe strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.\n\nThere is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.\n\nNot only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.\n\nWe aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.\n\n**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**\n\n* Zero gas fees.\n* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%\n* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.\n* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.\n* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.\n* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.\n* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.\n\n**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**\n\nElonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.\n\nIn Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.\n\nRockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.\n\nIf you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.\n\nCrypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.\n\n**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**\n\n* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!\n* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.\n* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.\n\n**Liquidity locked for 100 years**\n\nThe Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.\n\nHe did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.\n\n**13700 holders and rising**\n\nElonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.\n\nWith the project we are building it is easy to see why.\n\n**Low market cap**\n\nAt the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.\n\nWe are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.\n\nNow is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\n2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.\n\nIt pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.\n\n**Info**\n\n* AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released in Q1 this year\n* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap, Hotbit, and Whitebit\n* Liquidity locked for 100 years\n* Listed on CG + CMC\n* Strong community rising daily\n* Whitepaper released and available on the website\n* Contract: 0x97b65710d03e12775189f0d113202cc1443b0aa2\n\n**Links**\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Dextools: [https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b](https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b)\n\n\ud83d\udde3Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share](https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share)\n\n\ud83d\udcf1Telegram: [https://t.me/astro\\_elon](https://t.me/astro_elon)\n\n\ud83e\udd1dAudit: [https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/](https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/)\n\n\ud83d\udd10Liquidity Lock: [https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE](https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE)\n\n\ud83d\udcbbDiscord: [https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf](https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf)\n\n\ud83e\udd8eCoinGecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon](https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon)\n\n\ud83d\udd17CoinMarketCap: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/)\n\n\ud83c\udf0eWebsite: [https://astroelon.net/](https://astroelon.net/)\n\n\ud83d\udc26Twitter: [https://twitter.com/AstroElon](https://twitter.com/AstroElon)\n\n\ud83d\udcacTG Announcements: [https://t.me/astroelonannouncements](https://t.me/astroelonannouncements)",

Example: 0.1 Eth = 1 entry and 1 Eth = 10 entries. Entries made *AFTER* the time of this post are included.\n\n\\*Draw will be made on Saturday 16th April live on VC.\n\n\\*\\*You must also NOT sell any Elonone before the draw to qualify.\n\n\\*\\*\\*You can enter as many times as you like. Good luck!\n\n**ABOUT THE TOKEN:**\n\n**$ELONONE** is a utility token that powers a revolutionary new gasless NFT marketplace and a play to earn crypto racing game.\n\n* Gasless NFT Marketplace called AstroZero.\n* Play 2 Earn crypto racing game called Rocket Dash\n* Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply!\n* Liquidity locked for 100 years.\n* 13700 holders and rising.\n* Low market cap.\n\n**Gasless NFT Marketplace**\n\nElonone will be the token that powers the revolutionary upcoming gasless NFT marketplace called AstroZero. This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.\n\nAstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.\n\nWe strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.\n\nThere is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.\n\nNot only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.\n\nWe aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.\n\n**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**\n\n* Zero gas fees.\n* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%\n* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.\n* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.\n* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.\n* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.\n* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.\n\n**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**\n\nElonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.\n\nIn Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.\n\nRockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.\n\nIf you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.\n\nCrypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.\n\n**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**\n\n* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!\n* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.\n* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.\n\n**Liquidity locked for 100 years**\n\nThe Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.\n\nHe did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.\n\n**13700 holders and rising**\n\nElonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.\n\nWith the project we are building it is easy to see why.\n\n**Low market cap**\n\nAt the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.\n\nWe are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.\n\nNow is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\n2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.\n\nIt pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.\n\n**Info**\n\n* AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released in Q1 this year\n* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap, Hotbit, and Whitebit\n* Liquidity locked for 100 years\n* Listed on CG + CMC\n* Strong community rising daily\n* Whitepaper released and available on the website\n* Contract: 0x97b65710d03e12775189f0d113202cc1443b0aa2\n\n**Links**\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Dextools: [https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b](https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b)\n\n\ud83d\udde3Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share](https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share)\n\n\ud83d\udcf1Telegram: [https://t.me/astro\\_elon](https://t.me/astro_elon)\n\n\ud83e\udd1dAudit: [https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/](https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/)\n\n\ud83d\udd10Liquidity Lock: [https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE](https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE)\n\n\ud83d\udcbbDiscord: [https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf](https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf)\n\n\ud83e\udd8eCoinGecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon](https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon)\n\n\ud83d\udd17CoinMarketCap: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/)\n\n\ud83c\udf0eWebsite: [https://astroelon.net/](https://astroelon.net/)\n\n\ud83d\udc26Twitter: [https://twitter.com/AstroElon](https://twitter.com/AstroElon)\n\n\ud83d\udcacTG Announcements: [https://t.me/astroelonannouncements](https://t.me/astroelonannouncements)",

This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.\n\nAstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.\n\nWe strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.\n\nThere is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.\n\nNot only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.\n\nWe aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.\n\n**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**\n\n* Zero gas fees.\n* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%\n* Unmatched UX.

This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.\n\nIn Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.\n\nRockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.\n\nIf you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had.

He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years.

Good luck!\n\n**ABOUT THE TOKEN:**\n\n**$ELONONE** is a utility token that powers a revolutionary new gasless NFT marketplace and a play to earn crypto racing game.\n\n* Gasless NFT Marketplace called AstroZero.\n* Play 2 Earn crypto racing game called Rocket Dash\n* Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply!\n* Liquidity locked for 100 years.\n* 13700 holders and rising.\n* Low market cap.\n\n**Gasless NFT Marketplace**\n\nElonone will be the token that powers the revolutionary upcoming gasless NFT marketplace called AstroZero. This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.\n\nAstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.\n\nWe strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.\n\nThere is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.\n\nNot only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.\n\nWe aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.\n\n**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**\n\n* Zero gas fees.\n* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%\n* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.\n* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.\n* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.\n* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.\n* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.\n\n**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**\n\nElonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.\n\nIn Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.\n\nRockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.\n\nIf you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.\n\nCrypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.\n\n**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**\n\n* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!\n* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.\n* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.\n\n**Liquidity locked for 100 years**\n\nThe Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.\n\nHe did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.\n\n**13700 holders and rising**\n\nElonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.\n\nWith the project we are building it is easy to see why.\n\n**Low market cap**\n\nAt the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.\n\nWe are currently flying under the radar.

This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.\n\nAstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.\n\nWe strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.\n\nThere is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.\n\nNot only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.\n\nWe aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.\n\n**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**\n\n* Zero gas fees.\n* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%\n* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.\n* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.\n* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.\n* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.\n* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.\n\n**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**\n\nElonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.\n\nIn Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.\n\nRockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.\n\nIf you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.\n\nCrypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.\n\n**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**\n\n* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!\n* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.\n* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.\n\n**Liquidity locked for 100 years**\n\nThe Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.\n\nHe did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.\n\n**13700 holders and rising**\n\nElonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.\n\nWith the project we are building it is easy to see why.\n\n**Low market cap**\n\nAt the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.\n\nWe are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.\n\nNow is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\n2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.\n\nIt pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.\n\n**Info**\n\n* AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released in Q1 this year\n* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap, Hotbit, and Whitebit\n* Liquidity locked for 100 years\n* Listed on CG + CMC\n* Strong community rising daily\n* Whitepaper released and available on the website\n* Contract: 0x97b65710d03e12775189f0d113202cc1443b0aa2\n\n**Links**\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Dextools: [https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b](https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b)\n\n\ud83d\udde3Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share](https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share)\n\n\ud83d\udcf1Telegram: [https://t.me/astro\\_elon](https://t.me/astro_elon)\n\n\ud83e\udd1dAudit: [https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/](https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/)\n\n\ud83d\udd10Liquidity Lock: [https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE](https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE)\n\n\ud83d\udcbbDiscord: [https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf](https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf)\n\n\ud83e\udd8eCoinGecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon](https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon)\n\n\ud83d\udd17CoinMarketCap: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/)\n\n\ud83c\udf0eWebsite: [https://astroelon.net/](https://astroelon.net/)\n\n\ud83d\udc26Twitter: [https://twitter.com/AstroElon](https://twitter.com/AstroElon)\n\n\ud83d\udcacTG Announcements: [https://t.me/astroelonannouncements](https://t.me/astroelonannouncements)",

This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.\n\nAstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.\n\nWe strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.\n\nThere is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.\n\nNot only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.\n\nWe aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.\n\n**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**\n\n* Zero gas fees.\n* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%\n* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.\n* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.\n* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.\n* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.\n* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.\n\n**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**\n\nElonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.\n\nIn Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.\n\nRockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.\n\nIf you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.\n\nCrypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.\n\n**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**\n\n* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!\n* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.\n* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.\n\n**Liquidity locked for 100 years**\n\nThe Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.\n\nHe did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.\n\n**13700 holders and rising**\n\nElonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.\n\nWith the project we are building it is easy to see why.\n\n**Low market cap**\n\nAt the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.\n\nWe are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.\n\nNow is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\n2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.\n\nIt pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.\n\n**Info**\n\n* AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released in Q1 this year\n* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap, Hotbit, and Whitebit\n* Liquidity locked for 100 years\n* Listed on CG + CMC\n* Strong community rising daily\n* Whitepaper released and available on the website\n* Contract: 0x97b65710d03e12775189f0d113202cc1443b0aa2\n\n**Links**\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Dextools: [https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b](https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b)\n\n\ud83d\udde3Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share](https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share)\n\n\ud83d\udcf1Telegram: [https://t.me/astro\\_elon](https://t.me/astro_elon)\n\n\ud83e\udd1dAudit: [https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/](https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/)\n\n\ud83d\udd10Liquidity Lock: [https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE](https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE)\n\n\ud83d\udcbbDiscord: [https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf](https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf)\n\n\ud83e\udd8eCoinGecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon](https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon)\n\n\ud83d\udd17CoinMarketCap: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/)\n\n\ud83c\udf0eWebsite: [https://astroelon.net/](https://astroelon.net/)\n\n\ud83d\udc26Twitter: [https://twitter.com/AstroElon](https://twitter.com/AstroElon)\n\n\ud83d\udcacTG Announcements: [https://t.me/astroelonannouncements](https://t.me/astroelonannouncements)",

Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.\n\n**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**\n\n* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!\n* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.\n* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.\n\n**Liquidity locked for 100 years**\n\nThe Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.\n\nHe did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.\n\n**13700 holders and rising**\n\nElonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.\n\nWith the project we are building it is easy to see why.\n\n**Low market cap**\n\nAt the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.\n\nWe are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.\n\nNow is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\n2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.\n\nIt pays to hold our token.

This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.\n\nIn Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.\n\nRockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.\n\nIf you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.\n\nCrypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.\n\n**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**\n\n* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!\n* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.\n* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.\n\n**Liquidity locked for 100 years**\n\nThe Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.\n\nHe did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.\n\n**13700 holders and rising**\n\nElonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.\n\nWith the project we are building it is easy to see why.\n\n**Low market cap**\n\nAt the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.\n\nWe are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.\n\nNow is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\n2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.\n\nIt pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.\n\n**Info**\n\n* AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released in Q1 this year\n* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap, Hotbit, and Whitebit\n* Liquidity locked for 100 years\n* Listed on CG + CMC\n* Strong community rising daily\n* Whitepaper released and available on the website\n* Contract: 0x97b65710d03e12775189f0d113202cc1443b0aa2\n\n**Links**\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Dextools: [https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b](https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b)\n\n\ud83d\udde3Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share](https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share)\n\n\ud83d\udcf1Telegram: [https://t.me/astro\\_elon](https://t.me/astro_elon)\n\n\ud83e\udd1dAudit: [https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/](https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/)\n\n\ud83d\udd10Liquidity Lock: [https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE](https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE)\n\n\ud83d\udcbbDiscord: [https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf](https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf)\n\n\ud83e\udd8eCoinGecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon](https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon)\n\n\ud83d\udd17CoinMarketCap: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/)\n\n\ud83c\udf0eWebsite: [https://astroelon.net/](https://astroelon.net/)\n\n\ud83d\udc26Twitter: [https://twitter.com/AstroElon](https://twitter.com/AstroElon)\n\n\ud83d\udcacTG Announcements: [https://t.me/astroelonannouncements](https://t.me/astroelonannouncements)",

This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.\n\nAstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.\n\nWe strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.\n\nThere is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.\n\nNot only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.\n\nWe aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.\n\n**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**\n\n* Zero gas fees.\n* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%\n* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.\n* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.\n* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.\n* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.\n* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.\n\n**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**\n\nElonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash.

This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.\n\nAstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.\n\nWe strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.\n\nThere is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.\n\nNot only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.\n\nWe aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.\n\n**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**\n\n* Zero gas fees.\n* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%\n* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.\n* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.\n* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.\n* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.\n* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.\n\n**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**\n\nElonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.\n\nIn Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.\n\nRockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.\n\nIf you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.\n\nCrypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.\n\n**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**\n\n* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!\n* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.\n* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.\n\n**Liquidity locked for 100 years**\n\nThe Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.\n\nHe did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.\n\n**13700 holders and rising**\n\nElonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.\n\nWith the project we are building it is easy to see why.\n\n**Low market cap**\n\nAt the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.\n\nWe are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.\n\nNow is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\n2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.\n\nIt pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.\n\n**Info**\n\n* AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released in Q1 this year\n* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap, Hotbit, and Whitebit\n* Liquidity locked for 100 years\n* Listed on CG + CMC\n* Strong community rising daily\n* Whitepaper released and available on the website\n* Contract: 0x97b65710d03e12775189f0d113202cc1443b0aa2\n\n**Links**\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Dextools: [https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b](https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b)\n\n\ud83d\udde3Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share](https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share)\n\n\ud83d\udcf1Telegram: [https://t.me/astro\\_elon](https://t.me/astro_elon)\n\n\ud83e\udd1dAudit: [https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/](https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/)\n\n\ud83d\udd10Liquidity Lock: [https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE](https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE)\n\n\ud83d\udcbbDiscord: [https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf](https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf)\n\n\ud83e\udd8eCoinGecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon](https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon)\n\n\ud83d\udd17CoinMarketCap: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/)\n\n\ud83c\udf0eWebsite: [https://astroelon.net/](https://astroelon.net/)\n\n\ud83d\udc26Twitter: [https://twitter.com/AstroElon](https://twitter.com/AstroElon)\n\n\ud83d\udcacTG Announcements: [https://t.me/astroelonannouncements](https://t.me/astroelonannouncements)",

With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.\n\nWe strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.\n\nThere is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.\n\nNot only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.\n\nWe aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.\n\n**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**\n\n* Zero gas fees.\n* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%\n* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.\n* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.\n* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.\n* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.\n* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.\n\n**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**\n\nElonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.\n\nIn Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.\n\nRockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.\n\nIf you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.\n\nCrypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.\n\n**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**\n\n* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!\n* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.\n* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.\n\n**Liquidity locked for 100 years**\n\nThe Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.\n\nHe did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.\n\n**13700 holders and rising**\n\nElonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.\n\nWith the project we are building it is easy to see why.\n\n**Low market cap**\n\nAt the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.\n\nWe are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.\n\nNow is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\n2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.\n\nIt pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.\n\n**Info**\n\n* AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released in Q1 this year\n* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap, Hotbit, and Whitebit\n* Liquidity locked for 100 years\n* Listed on CG + CMC\n* Strong community rising daily\n* Whitepaper released and available on the website\n* Contract: 0x97b65710d03e12775189f0d113202cc1443b0aa2\n\n**Links**\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Dextools: [https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b](https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b)\n\n\ud83d\udde3Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share](https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share)\n\n\ud83d\udcf1Telegram: [https://t.me/astro\\_elon](https://t.me/astro_elon)\n\n\ud83e\udd1dAudit: [https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/](https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/)\n\n\ud83d\udd10Liquidity Lock: [https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE](https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE)\n\n\ud83d\udcbbDiscord: [https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf](https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf)\n\n\ud83e\udd8eCoinGecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon](https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon)\n\n\ud83d\udd17CoinMarketCap: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/)\n\n\ud83c\udf0eWebsite: [https://astroelon.net/](https://astroelon.net/)\n\n\ud83d\udc26Twitter: [https://twitter.com/AstroElon](https://twitter.com/AstroElon)\n\n\ud83d\udcacTG Announcements: [https://t.me/astroelonannouncements](https://t.me/astroelonannouncements)",

This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.\n\nAstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.\n\nWe strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.\n\nThere is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.\n\nNot only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.\n\nWe aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.\n\n**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**\n\n* Zero gas fees.\n* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%\n* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.\n* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.\n* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.\n* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.\n* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.\n\n**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**\n\nElonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.\n\nIn Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.\n\nRockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.\n\nIf you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.\n\nCrypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.\n\n**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**\n\n* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!\n* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.\n* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.\n\n**Liquidity locked for 100 years**\n\nThe Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.\n\nHe did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.\n\n**13700 holders and rising**\n\nElonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.\n\nWith the project we are building it is easy to see why.\n\n**Low market cap**\n\nAt the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.\n\nWe are currently flying under the radar.

This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.\n\nAstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.\n\nWe strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.\n\nThere is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.\n\nNot only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.\n\nWe aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.\n\n**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**\n\n* Zero gas fees.\n* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%\n* Unmatched UX.

This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.\n\nAstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.\n\nWe strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.\n\nThere is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.\n\nNot only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.\n\nWe aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.\n\n**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**\n\n* Zero gas fees.\n* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%\n* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.\n* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.\n* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.\n* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.\n* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.\n\n**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**\n\nElonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.\n\nIn Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.\n\nRockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.\n\nIf you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.\n\nCrypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.\n\n**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**\n\n* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!\n* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.\n* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.\n\n**Liquidity locked for 100 years**\n\nThe Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.\n\nHe did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment.

            "text": " \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ahu919xb36p81.jpg?width=1902&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d87461b5c2c36ff9922d37b6cb513632962dae8\n\n**$ELONONE** is a utility token that powers a revolutionary new gasless NFT marketplace and a play to earn crypto racing game.\n\n* Gasless NFT Marketplace called AstroZero.\n* Play 2 Earn crypto racing game called Rocket Dash\n* Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply!\n* Liquidity locked for 100 years.\n* 13700 holders and rising.\n* Low market cap.\n\n**Gasless NFT Marketplace**\n\nElonone will be the token that powers the revolutionary upcoming gasless NFT marketplace called AstroZero. This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.\n\nAstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.\n\nWe strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.\n\nThere is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.\n\nNot only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.\n\nWe aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.\n\n**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**\n\n* Zero gas fees.\n* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%\n* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.\n* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.\n* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.\n* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.\n* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.\n\n**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**\n\nElonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.\n\nIn Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.\n\nRockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.\n\nIf you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.\n\nCrypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.\n\n**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**\n\n* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!\n* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.\n* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.\n\n**Liquidity locked for 100 years**\n\nThe Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.\n\nHe did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.\n\n**13700 holders and rising**\n\nElonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.\n\nWith the project we are building it is easy to see why.\n\n**Low market cap**\n\nAt the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.\n\nWe are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.\n\nNow is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\n2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.\n\nIt pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.\n\n**Info**\n\n* AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released in Q1 this year\n* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap, Hotbit, and Whitebit\n* Liquidity locked for 100 years\n* Listed on CG + CMC\n* Strong community rising daily\n* Whitepaper released and available on the website\n* Contract: 0x97b65710d03e12775189f0d113202cc1443b0aa2\n\n**Links**\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Dextools: [https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b](https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x9ec5149472db6acffb9023a47d37b4ecbcf68a4b)\n\n\ud83d\udde3Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share](https://www.facebook.com/groups/557839712083505/permalink/570815420785934/?sfnsn=mo&ref=share)\n\n\ud83d\udcf1Telegram: [https://t.me/astro\\_elon](https://t.me/astro_elon)\n\n\ud83e\udd1dAudit: [https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/](https://solidity.finance/audits/AstroElon/)\n\n\ud83d\udd10Liquidity Lock: [https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE](https://team.finance/view-coin/0x97b65710D03E12775189F0D113202cc1443b0aa2?name=ASTROELON&symbol=ELONONE)\n\n\ud83d\udcbbDiscord: [https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf](https://discord.gg/aKUCQtVRFf)\n\n\ud83e\udd8eCoinGecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon](https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/astroelon)\n\n\ud83d\udd17CoinMarketCap: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astroelon/)\n\n\ud83c\udf0eWebsite: [https://astroelon.net/](https://astroelon.net/)\n\n\ud83d\udc26Twitter: [https://twitter.com/AstroElon](https://twitter.com/AstroElon)\n\n\ud83d\udcacTG Announcements: [https://t.me/astroelonannouncements](https://t.me/astroelonannouncements)",

This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.\n\nAstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.\n\nWe strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.\n\nThere is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.\n\nNot only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.\n\nWe aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.\n\n**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**\n\n* Zero gas fees.\n* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%\n* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.\n* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.\n* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.\n* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases.\n* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.\n\n**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**\n\nElonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.\n\nIn Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.\n\nRockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.\n\nIf you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.\n\nCrypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.\n\n**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**\n\n* On October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!\n* This not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.\n* Over time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.\n\n**Liquidity locked for 100 years**\n\nThe Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years.

Unfortunately the best code that gate io offers is 30% and anyone offering more is **certainly lying**.  You can see in their referral program here https://www.gate.io/referral that if you set it to 40% that means they get 0% commission and people are just saying this to scam you.  I fell for this same lie sadly and did not get a sign up bonus, GATE doesnt tell you before registration what the promo code new user benefits discount is.  Here is my [conversation](https://imgur.com/a/J2sI4Pk) with gates support, a manager later assured me in emails that the discount is there.  My code is for 30% discount sign up and also get a $1,000 USDtest.\n \n#https://www.gate.io/signup/3650407\n#3650407 - Referral ID\n \nTop 10 ranked exchange by CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap\n \nThey offer over 1,000+ different crypto coins tokens currently. Thats more than Binance, Crypto com, Coinbase, and FTX COMBINED\n \nOne of the best platforms for Futures Margin Leverage trading\n \nWorks Globally and they DO NOT have restrictions on countries such as the USA (except WAS state or NY), UK, or Singapore.\n \nPlease note you need to go to the USDtest Campaign (not USA) within 7 days. Begin by logging in to Gate.io and going to the giveaways menu bar at the top > Tasks and Bonuses > then redeem the $1,000 for verifying ID KYC. The USDTTEST should be then used in the HODL and EARN page and you can earn some interest on your free crypto! There are some other easy tasks on the campaigns page too.",

These digital assets are backed 1:1 by traditional stocks, entitling holders to the same economic benefits of owning the underlying stock.\n\nRastaSwap has been developed to be the #1 AMM Decentralized Exchange for Tokenized Cannabis stocks, and a bridge between the traditional stock market and crypto market, making it easier to invest in cannabis stocks and assets placed in different countries at the same time from anywhere in the world.\n\n**What is Decentralized Exchange (DEX)?**\n\nA decentralized exchange (or DEX) is a peer-to-peer marketplace where transactions occur directly between crypto traders. DEXs fulfill one of crypto\u2019s core possibilities: fostering financial transactions that aren\u2019t officiated by banks, while brokers running on blockchain with public registry of operations, handle all interactions automatically through Smart Contracts. There are Many popular DEXs, like PancakeSwap, Uniswap and Sushiswap.\n\n**What is AMM?**\n\nAMMs systems took off after they were first implemented by Shearson Lehman Brothers and ATD in the early 1990s.\n\nIn crypto, AMM is being used for the most important existing decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap and it allows digital assets to be traded in a permissionless and automatic way, by using liquidity pools rather than a traditional market of buyers and sellers. Prices are determined by a constant mathematical formula.\n\nLiquidity pools can be optimized for different purposes and are proving to be an important instrument in the DeFi ecosystem\n\nRastaSwap it\u2019s a AMM Decentralized Exchange community owned, which means that all liquidity pools are managed and owned by the community sharing the profit from all transactions on the exchange.\n\n**Passive Income**\n\nRastaSwap is a community owned and driven project. All Profit-sharing from all liquidity pools and transactions fees on the exchange are distributed to RastaCoin ($RCOIN) holders, everyday at 4:20 PM in form of $ETH, $BNB or $CAKE automatically deposited to your wallet . The tech behind this project will be managing the pools and farms so users can sit back, relax, and receive their profits automatically deposited in their Wallet.\n\n**A Secure Platform to Trade and Launch 4:20 Friendly Tokens**\n\nOur goal is to create a platform where any cannabis initiative can receive funds with RastaSwap. This can include startup projects or already established cannabis businesses. They will be able to issue tokens backed in real stocks or assets.\n\n**RastaCoin - $RCOIN Token Details**\n\n$RCOIN is the governance token of the RastaSwap project and it's mandatory to participate on voting and funding. When a new token is offered on market, having $RCOIN will be necessary in order to participate and the $RCOIN used will be burned to reduce the token supply.\n\n**Ticker:** $RCOIN\n\n**Token Specification:** BEP-20 / ERC-20\n\n**Max Supply:** 160,000,000 $RCOIN\n\n\ud83c\udf0d [Join pre-sales now!](https://rastaswap.com/)",

Their Discord has over doubled in members (from 1,200 to 2,700) in over a day, and it's no doubt that it is because this project are actually doing something different (and no I do not mean an NFT marketplace). \n\nThe tokenomics of this project are actually unique and make buying, holding and trading this token fun!!! Since the project incorporates fundamentally unique aspects, it means that this project is literally built to survive, and you can see that the developers actually care about crypto - something which we should all be prioritizing right now rather than these SafeX clones.\n\n# How do the tokenomics work?\n\nWell, the website explain it better than I probably can, but essentially every wallet has a tier and you can rank it up by simply buying and holding the token.\n\nAs your tier increases, the tax that you pay reduces and the amount of reflections you receive increase. The development team have also planned end game content once you've reached the maximum Tier, such as farming & staking and other cool things.\n\nThe developers have also added in something called **phantomization** which means while you are not a maximum tier, a percentage of your tokens are locked and hidden away inside your wallet where to earn them back you have to hold. This makes holding so much fun because you can literally watch your balance shoot up when you reach each next milestone.\n\n# The website has a wallet tracker\n\nOther than the fact that the devs have recently redesigned and overhauled their website, a really cool feature they've added to the website is wallet tracker interface. This shows you your token values, your wallet tier and balance, and how many phantom tokens you receive at each milestone and their respective values. One whale just received over $1,000 in phantom tokens in one go which is incredibly exciting.\n\nIf you want to go see it head to [https://diamondhold.net/](https://diamondhold.net/) \n\n# This project is literally the next one you should have your eyes on\n\nThe devs are super active and are working on things faster than I have seen other projects, which leads me to believe that other projects are simply marketing teams, influencers and opportunitists that don't actually have programming or crypto experience. \n\n# The future?\n\nThe devs plan to add governance where you can actually vote on how to steer the project, making it truly community driven, and finally they hope to use their token in arcades and games of chance in an online casino for their 18+ members. \n\nCome join the conversation at [https://discord.gg/DiamondHold](https://discord.gg/DiamondHold) and [https://t.me/DiamondHold](https://t.me/DiamondHold)",

These loans will allow users to further participate in the DeFi ecosystem and expand their profit potential. Delegated Vaults on non-native tokens are also in the pipeline.\n\nWe plan to build an AMM exchange which will bring even more liquidity into the protocol.

Loyal holder's of Royal BNB will always gain a massive 15% ROI automatically sent to their wallets in BNB without the hassle of claiming every 30 minutes.\n\nNot only accumulating the highest BNB deposit on the market, it also has a new feature called ROYAL THRUST, we believe this is the next big solidity code revolution.\n\nSo what do we mean by the Royal Thrust, it is an intelligent piece of algorithm which takes data points of each dip and waits to buy up the threshold point until limit is reached. This gives a sky-rocketing shot at green candles every time the system kicks in.\n\nThis is the first ever type of code ever deployed on Binance Smart Chain and its new feature makes this token completely unique.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\ud83d\udc51 Royal Advantages \ud83d\udc8e**\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 15% Auto BNB Rewards every 30 minutes\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 Audited Contract\n\n\ud83d\udd10 Locked Liquidity\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Only 5% Marketing Wallet and no other wallets\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udeb7 Bot free group, yes the numbers might be low but 100% genuine investors, we are keen to engage real people who understands what it is like to be treated like a Royal, so what are you waiting for?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\ud83d\udc51 ROYAL facts, not promises \ud83d\udc51**\n\n\u2705 Verified BSC Contract : [https://bscscan.com/address/0x9f0f7acc4c49bfb8d5d65df0fc822fbc920b71de#code](https://bscscan.com/address/0x9f0f7acc4c49bfb8d5d65df0fc822fbc920b71de#code)\n\n**\ud83d\udd0f FULL AUDIT :** [https://github.com/sokenteam/smart\\_contract\\_audits/blob/ef59c577be351fc758d4343d348476feba368757/Royal%20BNB%20Standard%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit.pdf](https://github.com/sokenteam/smart_contract_audits/blob/ef59c577be351fc758d4343d348476feba368757/Royal%20BNB%20Standard%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoin Royal BNB with other Royals, it certainly is a Royal extravaganza \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude80\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the BNB Rewards, you won't need to connect your wallet, it'll go to your wallet automatically, and 15% redistributed to holders every 30 minutes.

These digital assets are backed 1:1 by traditional stocks, entitling holders to the same economic benefits of owning the underlying stock.\n\nRastaSwap has been developed to be the #1 AMM Decentralized Exchange for Tokenized Cannabis stocks, and a bridge between the traditional stock market and crypto market, making it easier to invest in cannabis stocks and assets placed in different countries at the same time from anywhere in the world.\n\n**What is Decentralized Exchange (DEX)?**\n\nA decentralized exchange (or DEX) is a peer-to-peer marketplace where transactions occur directly between crypto traders. DEXs fulfill one of crypto\u2019s core possibilities: fostering financial transactions that aren\u2019t officiated by banks, while brokers running on blockchain with public registry of operations, handle all interactions automatically through Smart Contracts. There are Many popular DEXs, like PancakeSwap, Uniswap and Sushiswap.\n\n**What is AMM?**\n\nAMMs systems took off after they were first implemented by Shearson Lehman Brothers and ATD in the early 1990s.\n\nIn crypto, AMM is being used for the most important existing decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap and it allows digital assets to be traded in a permissionless and automatic way, by using liquidity pools rather than a traditional market of buyers and sellers. Prices are determined by a constant mathematical formula.\n\nLiquidity pools can be optimized for different purposes and are proving to be an important instrument in the DeFi ecosystem\n\nRastaSwap it\u2019s a AMM Decentralized Exchange community owned, which means that all liquidity pools are managed and owned by the community sharing the profit from all transactions on the exchange.\n\n**Passive Income**\n\nRastaSwap is a community owned and driven project. All Profit-sharing from all liquidity pools and transactions fees on the exchange are distributed to RastaCoin ($RCOIN) holders, everyday at 4:20 PM in form of $ETH, $BNB or $CAKE automatically deposited to your wallet . The tech behind this project will be managing the pools and farms so users can sit back, relax, and receive their profits automatically deposited in their Wallet.\n\n**A Secure Platform to Trade and Launch 4:20 Friendly Tokens**\n\nOur goal is to create a platform where any cannabis initiative can receive funds with RastaSwap. This can include startup projects or already established cannabis businesses. They will be able to issue tokens backed in real stocks or assets.\n\n**RastaCoin - $RCOIN Token Details**\n\n$RCOIN is the governance token of the RastaSwap project and it's mandatory to participate on voting and funding. When a new token is offered on market, having $RCOIN will be necessary in order to participate and the $RCOIN used will be burned to reduce the token supply.\n\n**Ticker:** $RCOIN\n\n**Token Specification:** BEP-20 / ERC-20\n\n**Max Supply:** 160,000,000 $RCOIN",

            "text": "[Project website: https://rastacake.com](https://rastacake.com/)\n\n**What are Tokenized Stocks?**\n\nTokenized stocks are tokenized derivatives that represent traditional securities, particularly shares in publicly listed companies traded on regulated exchanges such as Scotts Miracle-Gro, Curaleaf, Aurora, Apple, Tesla and others.\n\nThe key benefits of tokenized stocks include fractional ownership of traditional securities, 24/7 access to markets, and greater liquidity to name a few. These digital assets are backed 1:1 by traditional stocks, entitling holders to the same economic benefits of owning the underlying stock.\n\nRastaCake has been developed to be the #1 AMM Decentralized Exchange for Tokenized Cannabis stocks, and a bridge between the traditional stock market and crypto market, making it easier to invest in cannabis stocks and assets placed in different countries at the same time from anywhere in the world.\n\n**What is Decentralized Exchange (DEX)?**\n\nA decentralized exchange (or DEX) is a peer-to-peer marketplace where transactions occur directly between crypto traders. DEXs fulfill one of crypto\u2019s core possibilities: fostering financial transactions that aren\u2019t officiated by banks, while brokers running on blockchain with public registry of operations, handle all interactions automatically through Smart Contracts. There are Many popular DEXs, like PancakeSwap, Uniswap and Sushiwap.\n\n**What is AMM?**\n\nAMMs systems took off after they were first implemented by Shearson Lehman Brothers and ATD in the early 1990s.\n\nIn crypto, AMM is being used for the most important existing decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap and it allows digital assets to be traded in a permissionless and automatic way, by using liquidity pools rather than a traditional market of buyers and sellers. Prices are determined by a constant mathematical formula.\n\nLiquidity pools can be optimized for different purposes and are proving to be an important instrument in the DeFi ecosystem\n\nRastaCake it\u2019s a AMM Decentralized Exchange community owned, which means that all liquidity pools are managed and owned by the community sharing the profit from all transactions on the exchange.\n\n**Passive Income**\n\nRastaCake is a community owned and driven project. All Profit-sharing from all liquidity pools and transactions fees on the exchange are distributed to $RCAKE holders, everyday at 4:20 PM in form of $ETH or $RKACE automatically deposited to your wallet . The tech behind this project will be managing the pools and farms so users can sit back, relax, and receive their profits automatically deposited in their Wallet.\n\n**A Secure Platform to Trade and Launch 4:20 Friendly Tokens**\n\nOur goal is to create a platform where any cannabis initiative can receive funds with RastaCake. This can include startup projects or already established cannabis businesses. They will be able to issue tokens backed in real stocks or assets.\n\n**$RCAKE Token Details**\n\n$RCAKE is the governance token of the RastaCake project and it's mandatory to participate on voting and funding. When a new token is offered on market, having $RCAKE will be necessary in order to participate and the $RCAKE used will be burned to reduce the token supply.\n\n**Ticker:** $RCAKE\n\n**Token Specification:** BEP-20 / ERC-20\n\n**Max Supply:** 160,000,000 $RCAKE\n\n**Pre-sale Phases:** 10 phases\n\n**Pre-sales End:** 20 September\n\n**Pre-sale prices:** From $0.01 up to $0.1\n\n**ICO Start:** 21 September\n\n**ICO prices:** Starting from $0.11\n\n**Accepted Payments:** ETH, CAKE, BNB, BUSD, USDT, BTC, XLM and XRP\n\n[Project website: https://rastacake.com](https://rastacake.com/)\n\n[Reddit Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/RastacakeFinance/) \\- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rastacakedefi/) \\- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RastaCakeDeFi) \\- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rastacake/about/) \\- [Telegram](https://t.me/RastaCake)",

Thats why we have renounced ownership of the Shiba Max contract on launch ensuring no individual or entity has control of Shiba Max, ensuring that it is decentralized and secure for all investors.\n\nOur Tokenomics are as follows:\n\nAuto-Liquidity Generation: 7% of all Shiba Max transactions will be contributed to building Liquidity ensuring the growth, stability, and sustainability of the token. This feature ensures that the price of the token is backed by a constantly growing liquidity pool. Multiple secure liquidity pools will be added as we grow, and our token is listed on centralized exchanges such as Bilaxy and Hotbit. The rate of contributions will only increase as our community grows and trading volume increases providing stability and security to our investors.\n\nDecentralization: Contract Ownership was renounced at launch as a result of this action no individual or entity has ownership of the contract, making Shiba Max secure and fair for our community and truly decentralized. 100% of Liquidity was locked on launch (Please refer to our FAQ section for link) to ensure security and peace of mind for our investors.Shiba Max was tested extensively using the testnet prior to launch to ensure absolute security and accuracy of function, it was designed to be scalable, self-sustaining, and to scale seamlessly and frictionlessly on a fully autonomous and rapidly growing DeFi ecosystem.\n\nShiba Maximum Rewards: All holders will have their Shiba Max balance grow through RFI Rewards at intervals as the Shiba Max Army grows. This function will allow the Army to effectively earn interest rewards which will increase as our community grows. Our mission is to ensure that the Shiba Max Army is rewarded as our domination of the Crypto Market continues on.\n\nThe Shiba Max NFT Marketplace and its offerings is brimming on the horizon. We will be working garner a roster of the best Digital artists, Influencers, Celebrities, and Athletes to have an all-star lineup of NFT releases at launch. The Dynamic NFT releases would also be paired with Physical Merchandise to add further value to our Marketplace offerings. Airdrops will also be going out to our top shillers and holders.",

Loyal holder's of Royal BNB will always gain a massive 15% ROI automatically sent to their wallets in BNB without the hassle of claiming every 30 minutes. \n\nNot only accumulating the highest BNB deposit on the market, it also has a new feature called ROYAL THRUST, we believe this is the next big solidity code revolution.\n\nSo what do we mean by the Royal Thrust, it is an intelligent piece of algorithm which takes data points of each dip and waits to buy up the threshold point until limit is reached. This gives a sky-rocketing shot at green candles every time the system kicks in. \n\nThis is the first ever type of code ever deployed on Binance Smart Chain and its new feature makes this token completely unique.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\ud83d\udc51 Royal Advantages \ud83d\udc8e**\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 15% Auto BNB Rewards every 30 minutes \n\n\ud83c\udfc6 Audited Contract\n\n\ud83d\udd10 Locked Liquidity\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Only 5% Marketing Wallet and no other wallets\n\n\ud83d\udeb7 Bot free group, yes the numbers might be low but 100% genuine investors, we are keen to engage real people who understands what it is like to be treated like a Royal, so what are you waiting for? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\ud83d\udc51 ROYAL facts, not promises \ud83d\udc51**\n\n\ud83d\udd10 Marketing 5% Wallet Locked : [https://dxsale.app/app/v2\\_9/dxlockview?id=0&add=0x8A1e29922b44f35f9fB50E0436D773503B6d47E6&type=tokenlock&chain=BSC](https://dxsale.app/app/v2_9/dxlockview?id=0&add=0x8A1e29922b44f35f9fB50E0436D773503B6d47E6&type=tokenlock&chain=BSC)\n\n0\ufe0f\u20e3 No Dev/Team Tokens : [https://bscscan.com/token/0x9F0F7aCC4C49bfb8D5D65df0FC822fBC920b71DE#balances](https://bscscan.com/token/0x9F0F7aCC4C49bfb8D5D65df0FC822fBC920b71DE#balances)\n\n\u2705 Verified BSC Contract : [https://bscscan.com/address/0x9f0f7acc4c49bfb8d5d65df0fc822fbc920b71de#code](https://bscscan.com/address/0x9f0f7acc4c49bfb8d5d65df0fc822fbc920b71de#code)\n\n\ud83d\udd0f FULL AUDIT : [https://github.com/sokenteam/smart\\_contract\\_audits/blob/ef59c577be351fc758d4343d348476feba368757/Royal%20BNB%20Standard%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit.pdf](https://github.com/sokenteam/smart_contract_audits/blob/ef59c577be351fc758d4343d348476feba368757/Royal%20BNB%20Standard%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Join Royal BNB with other Royals, it certainly is a Royal extravaganza \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude80**\n\nFor the BNB Rewards, you won't need to connect your wallet, it'll go to your wallet automatically, and 15% redistributed to holders every 30 minutes.

MoonBase allows users to interact with casino games built on the MoonFlip bonus token to allow new behavior, including games like craps or blackjack. Offering an immersive user experience, players will view the virtual reality casino much like a brick and mortar casino, but open for all and backed by the power of MoonFlip. \n\n- Users will be able to interact with and watch each other's gaming, including a hang-out space in virtual reality that includes a virtual nightclub providing a brand new gaming experience while combining the metaverse with Web3 blockchain applications.\n&nbsp;\n\n##Info links for MoonFlip:\n\nWebsite: https://moonflip.net/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/moonflipcrypto\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/moonfliptoken\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/nZeN5sz8aN\n\nWhitepaper: https://moonflip.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MoonFlip-Whitepaper-v0.5.pdf\n\nToken address: 0xb689ddfa32AB396E5662da2E3E095a1CdbBEcfF0\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Our presale will take place on February 28 at 12 PM EST / 5 PM UTC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Moonflip is an incentivized liquidity seeking token which uses these mechanisms: \n\n\ud83d\udcb0Bonus Tokens awarded on purchases\n\n\ud83d\udcb0Bonus token pool distributions\n\n\ud83d\udcb0Sales tax funds the bonus token pool\n\n\ud83d\udcb0You can simply purchase the Moonflip token available on Pancakeswap and also through our Moon Trader for your chance to win up to +10,000% from the token pool.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0At Moonflip we do not penalize buyers, we reward them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2705 Bonus Token - Every buy transaction on the Moonflip smart contract gives you the chance to receive a bonus from the pool. The bonus is determined by the size of your token purchase.\n\n\u2705 Bonus Pool - The bonus pool is where bonus payouts are sourced; this is funded by trading volume of Moonflip tokens; 10% of all sell orders are redirected to feed the bonus pool.\n\n\u2705 Tokenomics - The bonus pool is wholly funded by trading activity; more specifically, 10% of all sales called to the smart contract are redirected to the bonus pool.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###How is MoonFlip Trustless?\n\n- 100% of the presale raise will go to the liquidity pool, and then locked before launching.\n\n- The team is allocated 10% of total supply, therefore they have an incentive to grow the token and profit together with the community.\n\n- Superior Tokenomics: No burning of tokens is needed due to a handicapped structure with an unsustainable deflationary objective\n\n- Moonflip is player focused; 100% of the sell tax directed to the bonus pool will be returned to players during buys.\n\n##**Every purchase is an opportunity** | Traders have a chance to win \u2013 proportionate to size of investment \u2013 with every buy order on the Moonflip smart contract",

While these benefits are currently only available for users of BSC, Dough will be launching the platform across chains with other EVM chains as early targets, and further plans to integrate with Cardano, Solana, and Terra.\n\nThe short version of why I think this project is definitely worth it:\n\n\\- Existing tangible product\n\n\\- The project itself fairlaunched in September 2021, so no ICO\n\n\\- Continuous development on product\n\n\\- Weekly AMA's in Telegram with the CEO and Devs\n\n\\- Very active community\n\n\\- Dividend payments and Staking\n\n\\- Several pending exchange Listings applications\n\n\\- And definitely more\n\nThe longer version:\n\nDough focusses on making crypto safer for investors to track, trade and create projects. With innovative features such as a token creator, free lp lockers, biometric KYC, dashboarding, onramping and vetted influencers.\n\nWith the tokenomics and the way Dough contract is coded, it is impossible to rug-pull. This also goes for any project being created in the Dough ecosystem. The revenue generated in the ecosystem is fed into a staking contract with 5 pools which reward in DOUGH and BNB.\n\nSimply put, as a Dough holder you can choose to stake your Dough and bring in a passive income.\n\nSo what makes Dough special?\n\nDough is building a ecosystem where developers and investors can Track, Trade and Create tokens. All in one place: the Doughpad.\n\nThe Doughpad roadmap contains:\n\n\\- Swap AMM + farming\n\n\\- Fiat Onramp + Visacard\n\n\\- Automated token creator\n\n\\- IDO platform + token/reward locker\n\n\\- Project backing\n\n\\- Ownership locker\n\n\\- Automated audit of all contracts created\n\n\\- Charting for all dough launched tokens\n\n\\- Reward and Portfolio tracker\n\n\\- Defi 2.0 Liquidity Protocol\n\n\\- NFT marketplace\n\n\\- Influencer Hub for devs to book marketing\n\n\\- Play2Earn Game Hub\n\nAs always: No financial advise and do your own research.\n\nSome sources are:\n\n\\- Telegram: [https://t.me/doughbsc](https://t.me/doughbsc)\n\n\\- Website: [https://doughpad.com/](https://doughpad.com/)\n\n\\- Dough library: [https://docs.doughpad.com/](https://docs.doughpad.com/)\n\n\\- Coinmarketcap: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dough/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dough/)",

This will bring immense value to the Elonone token due to the high amount of users and transactions expected.\n\nAstroZero will be putting the artists first. With ZERO gas fees and a tiny transaction fee as low as 0.25%, we will be removing the financial barrier that many NFT artists face when trying to sell their work.\n\nWe strongly believe that people from all parts of the world deserve equal access to reaching their full potential in the NFT space without being hindered by insane gas fees and the extortionate transaction fees that other NFT marketplaces charge.\n\nThere is a huge amount of artistic talent in the developing world and we want to harness that and give these people the means to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and also to improve the communities around them.\n\nNot only will zero gas fees and 0.25% transaction fees attract huge numbers of artists but it will also attract a large user base that wants to get real value for their money.\n\nWe aim to quickly take a large market share and will work towards becoming the number one NFT marketplace as quickly as possible.\u00a0  \n\n\n\u00a0  \n\n\n**What will make the marketplace rise above the competition?**  \n\n\n\u00a0  \n\n\n* Zero gas fees.\n* Lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.25%\n* Unmatched UX. The marketplace will change its design and feel depending on what category of NFTs you are viewing. There is no other marketplace like it.\n* Drops Feature - Will allow artists to create a an ERC-721 smart contract (NFTs) with just a few clicks on AstroZero with numbers of up to 10,000, add unique rarity properties (e.g. 1% are gold, 4% are silver etc). Then they will be able to host their drop on AstroZero, or their own website. This will be FAR cheaper for the artist than doing it themselves.\n* Determined team containing NFT artists and developers that have been highly successful in the crypto industry. We will strive to make AstroZero THE NFT marketplace of choice for the majority of NFT artists and investors alike.\n* Hundreds of NFT artists are ready to sign up on launch and have collections ready. Among these are well known celebrities and NFT artists. This will bring mass exposure and users from their large fanbases. \n* Mass marketing campaign for and after launch. We will leave no stone unturned when it comes to letting the world know.   \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Play 2 Earn Crypto Game**\u00a0  \n\u00a0  \n\n\nElonone will also be the token that powers a new play 2 earn crypto game called Rocket Dash. This game will be a racing game similar to Zed Run.\n\nIn Rocket Dash the player will be able to race his rocket against the competition for prize money and users will also be able to bet on the outcome of races.\n\nRockets will be upgradeable and parts for the rockets will be available as NFTs sold on the AstroZero NFT marketplace.\n\nIf you are wondering what value this will add to the token then just think of the success that Axie Infinity and Zed Run have had. You should expect to see similar here.\n\nCrypto gaming is huge and is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming months so we expect the token to benefit massively from having its own crypto game. Having the game linked to the marketplace will also add even more to the tokens value.\u00a0  \n\n\n\u00a0  \n\n\n**Vitalik Buterin burned 38% of our supply**\u00a0  \n\u00a0  \n\n\nOn October 31st, Vitalik Buterin burned 38.7% of the total tokens supply!\n\nThis not only increased the scarcity of the token, which in turn raises its value, but it also created a huge burn wallet that has made the token deflationary.\n\nOver time we expect this to add a lot of value to the token especially when the transactions from AstroZero and Rocket Dash start to ramp up.\u00a0  \n\u00a0  \n\n\n**Liquidity locked for 100 years**\u00a0  \n\u00a0  \n\n\nThe Elonone Developer wanted to create a safe token for investors to invest in. He provided the liquidity himself and locked it for 100 years. He will never be able to access the liquidity he provided in his lifetime.\n\nHe did this to ensure that Elonone investors have piece of mind when it comes to the security of their investment. This is how crypto should be and you should never settle for anything less.\u00a0  \n\u00a0  \n\n\n**13700 holders and rising**\u00a0  \n\u00a0  \n\n\nElonone has a strong, loyal community that is growing daily.\n\nWith the project we are building it is easy to see why.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Low market cap**\u00a0  \n\u00a0  \n\n\nAt the time of writing this post, we currently sit at a market cap of $6.5m.\n\nWe are currently flying under the radar. This will change once our mass marketing campaign begins.\n\nNow is a great time to invest with what is coming in the near future.\u00a0  \n\u00a0  \n\n\n**Tokenomics**  \n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n2% tax that gets redistributed to all holders on every buy, sell, and swap.\n\nIt pays to hold our token. Especially as it becomes more scarce due to the burn wallet that Vitalik Buterin himself created.\u00a0  \n\u00a0  \n\n\n**Info**\u00a0  \n\u00a0  \n\n\n* AstroZero and Rocket Dash are due to be released in Q1 this year\n* $ELONONE token is available to buy on Uniswap, Hotbit, and Whitebit\n* Liquidity locked for 100 years\n* Listed on CG + CMC\n* Strong community rising daily\n* Whitepaper released and available on the website\n* Contract:  0x97b65710d03e12775189f0d113202cc1443b0aa2\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPlease feel free to come and visit us.

This gives a sky-rocketing shot at green candles every time the system kicks in.\n\nThis is the first ever type of code ever deployed on Binance Smart Chain and its new feature makes this token completely unique.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\ud83d\udc51 Royal Advantages**\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 15% Auto BNB Rewards every 30 minutes\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 Audited Contract\n\n\ud83d\udd10 Locked Liquidity\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Only 5% Marketing Wallet and no other wallets\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udeb7 Bot free group, yes the numbers might be low but 100% genuine investors, we are keen to engage real people who understands what it is like to be treated like a Royal, so what are you waiting for?\n\nJoin Royal BNB with other Royals, it certainly is a Royal extravaganza \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude80\n\nFor the BNB Rewards, you won't need to connect your wallet, it'll go to your wallet automatically, and 15% redistributed to holders every 30 minutes.

To avoid talking about it when we're all red, we're going to focus on the huge victories and enormous profits.\n\nA year ago, LOT.TRADE had many competitions for traders, and some of you may have heard of them or seen them. For this reason, both newcomers and seasoned investors have flocked to it in droves. Attracting my attention was the low entry price. I was able to participate in two of these tournaments despite the fact that the prize money was included. This time, I'll take home a reward of 5,000 BUSD. For me, it would have been a lot easier if I had realized that all I was required to do was show the greatest ROI over the course of the next month.\n\nRecently, these guys declared that they'll be launching tournaments with higher rewards and better rivals as well.. At the same time, they'll provide a certain number of various grade NFTs that guarantee tournament participation, up to 55% APY (!) and, of course, a portion of the prize pool.\n\nThose who know what I'm talking about will no sure be interested in this. I'm not trying to promote this. These NFTs are now on sale for up to a 30 percent discount.",

Along with an upcoming tier 2 exchange listing that is planned after launch, Parabolic plans to be a powerhouse in crypto-style casino games that will one day be available in its very own MetaVerse!\n\n\u200b\n\n>HOW DOES THE GAME WORK?\n\nThe debut game from Parabolic is a unique launch simulation crash game with mid-game cashouts and a chart that climbs and collapses. The game is finally going to be made public after 6 long months of development.\n\nAt the beginning of each round, players will place their bets by depositing the amount of parabolic token they wish to gamble. As the round progresses the trading chart will be become more and more parabolic increasing the bet multiplier. The aim of the game is to is to cash out before the chart rug pulls (crashes). Gameplay is based on crypto trading charts and is designed to look that way also. To place your bet, you \u2018Buy\u2019 tokens and to cash out you \u2018Sell\u2019 Tokens\n\nThere are several elements that distinguish this crash game from the rest. One of them is a one-of-a-kind feature that allows users to cash out a percentage of their wager while playing live. 50% of the house edge profit from the parabolic game will be burned to boost the coin's value for its owners. The remaining 50% of profits will be put aside for game liquidity. With a large amount of game liquidity, winners will always be able to be paid out on schedule.\n\nThe transaction taxes of the Parabolic Token include:\n\n* 3% - Unique Buy Back\n* 3% - Deflationary Burn\n* 3% - Auto-Liquidity\n* 3% - Game development\n\n\u200b\n\n>WHAT MAKES THE PARABOLIC ECOSYSTEM SO LUCRATIVE?\n\nWhen Parabolic burns tokens, it entirely eliminates them from the supply, unlike most coins that simply transfer burnt tokens to a dead address. As a result, the liquidity to market cap ratio is constantly decreasing, raising the value of users holdings in respect to the market cap. The project expects it\u2019s tokenomics to wipe out a high percentage of the supply within the first 24 hours of its debut.\n\nHolders of Parabolic Token will also not be hit by exorbitant taxes. Instead, every penny collected from transaction taxes will be invested back into the project. The Parabolic team have given their commitment to providing the best crypto experience to all their valued investors.\n\n\u200b\n\n>BSC Staking Pool\n\n* 30 Day Locked Staking (17% APY)\n* 90 Day Locked Staking (36% APY)\n* 180 Day Locked Staking (75% APY)\n\n\u200b\n\n>TOKENOMICS\n\nInitial Total Supply 1,000,000,000,000\n\n* BSC Network 400,000,000,000\n* ETH Network 300,000,000,000\n* MATIC Network 100,000,000,000\n* FTM Network 100,000,000,000\n* AVAX Network 100,000,000,000\n\n\u200b\n\nThe platform has also just released a Gleam Giveaway Competition with a grand prize worth $1000. One lucky winner will receive $1000 worth of Parabolic Token after Game Launch, while 100 more lucky winners will receive $10 worth of Parabolic after Game Launch. In order to participate and stand a chance to win the grand prize users must complete actions on the gleam competition to get entries. The more entries you have, the higher your chance of winning!\n\n>Gleam Competition Link:\n\ngleam.io/h8gBN/parabolic-giveaway-competition\n\n# Upcoming AMAs\n\n* 21st April, 19:00 UTC - TravLadd [https://t.me/AMA\\_Central](https://t.me/AMA_Central)\n* 21st April, Midnight UTC - Satoshi Street Bets [https://t.me/satoshistreetbets](https://t.me/satoshistreetbets)\n\n# Contact\n\n[Website](https://parabolictoken.com/) | [Telegram](https://t.me/ParabolicToken) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ParabolicToken)",

IFY is a high-potential investment that will be featured on Wall Street Bets and Satoshi Bets on February 16.\n\nIFY is a crypto that is loyal to its holders, and offers many ways to make huge returns. Through the Weak Hand Tax, market manipulation and other factors that may result in depreciation of value are deterred AND the IFY staking pool is fueled (self sufficient). Infinity Yield offers staking at up to 245% ROI, a number that will be hard for anyone to turn down. \n\nFor those interested in investing, the IFY presale begins on February 23 at 19:00 UTC, and is available through the infinity yield website. There is a limited amount of available tokens that will be sold during the presale, so it is important to get in early to ensure you get a spot.\n\nFor more information and future updates on Infinity Yield, visit our website: http://infinityyield.fun/",

And although it didn\u2019t quite produce the instant moon shots expected around the market, it did produce a smorgasbord of tasty new projects. Perhaps the most succulent one is a decentralized, community-based marketplace for tokenized alternative investments called Smart Valor.\n\nThe VALOR Platform is blockchain agnostic and designed to evolve and expand over time. Most of the components will be open source with outside contributors able to build apps on top of it. Here are the current components that will be available on the platform.\n\n* App marketplace:\u00a0Third party providers or any contributor for that matter can build apps on top of Valor. The users can then purchase or license these apps via the marketplace\n* ICO platform with tokenization engine:\u00a0Basicallyn this is an incubator. VALOR helps guide new projects through the token sale process, making sure the model/smart contract is consistent with the asset.\n* Task marketplace:\u00a0Anyone with talent will be rewarded for coding, research, performance predictions and more. According to the company, \u201cPositive reviews from the community and accurate performance predictions will build your publicly verifiable reputation and increase your earning potential.\u201d\n* Governance and voting engine:\u00a0The community will govern most of VALOR by voting on decisions, contributing to polls, introducing petitions, etc.\n* Rewards and bounty programs:\u00a0Stakeholders earn rewards by engagement in opinion polls, being involved in governance matters, giving input on new assets being considered for listing, providing liquidity and much more things that haven\u2019t been added yet.\n* Decentralized auctioning marketplace:\u00a0Smart contract enabled auction marketplace that helps price discovery and supports liquidity in low volume traded assets, for both investors and asset issuers.\n* Licensed exchange:\u00a0Trade asset and crypto tokens while following all regulations.\n* Authentication and identity:\u00a0Authenticate and manage user IDs with multi-factor authentication implemented.\n* Secure custody for crypto assets:\u00a0Valor accounts or wallets allow you to hold your tokenized assets safe and securely.\n* Portfolio management:\u00a0User-friendly dashboard, desktop and mobile.

Yet 36% of brands still pay influencers with free product samples rather than cash.\n\nThere are also challenges faced on the brand side.\n\n40% of marketers aren\u2019t sure if their campaigns are even effective and 90% find it difficult to fully understand how influencer compensation is calculated. Running an influencer marketing campaign is time-consuming, stressful, and inefficient.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**No efficient method has ever existed to plan and automate campaigns \u2014 until now.**\n\nChirpley\u2019s vision is to liberate small influencers by enabling them to earn a living through content creation alone. At the same time, they aim to empower brands by removing the obstacles usually faced when working with nano and micro-influencers.\n\n\u201cWe imagine a place where the worlds of the brave, creative, and hardworking come together. We believe that through thinking differently you can unleash your earning potential. This is a part of our vision.\u201d \u2014 Chirpley\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, Sam.\n\n[Launch your influencer campaign now.](https://app.chirpley.ai/Account/Register)\n\nAnother element of Chirpley\u2019s vision is **$CHIRP** \u2014 the utility token in the Chirpley environment and the driver behind its deflationary system.\n\nThe imminent release of the $CHIRP token is expected to pique the interest of crypto-investors actively seeking highly promoting start-ups.\n\nChirpley has secured **$900k from its first round of seed funding** and forged several dynamic partnerships.\n\nThe Present \u2013 Presale and IDO\n\nTo further strengthen the current product and add multiple dapps and features as per the roadmap, Chirpley is proposing to raise **$4M through the sale of its own proprietary token, $CHIRP**. The token would be used as the utility token to Access to ecosystem utilities, Direct P2P compensation, Community engagement, Ecosystem governance, Memberships & rewards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, what exactly is $CHIRP\n\n$CHIRP is the utility token in the Chirpley ecosystem. When used, the deflationary token grants 50% off on-platform fees. In addition, 20% of all revenue earned through the platform is used to perform hourly buy-backs on the market, where after the purchased $CHIRP tokens are sent to a burn address.\n\n$CHIRP \u2014 the utility token in the Chirpley environment and the driver behind its deflationary system. The imminent release of the $CHIRP token is already piquing the interest of crypto-investors actively seeking highly promoting start-ups which is demonstrated by the onboarding of the below partners and investors to Chirpley.\n\nLearn more about what Chirpley has to offer through its official website [chirpley.ai](https://chirpley.ai/) and stay up-to-date about its plans for the future through the official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chirpley).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChirpley is supported by well-known Partners and Investors in the crypto industry.\n\nLVT Capital \u2043 Dcentralab \u2043 Chainport \u2043 Tokensfarm \u2043 FantomStarter \u2043 Poolz \u2043 Decubate \u2043 Blkbirds \u2043 NFTb \u2043 Cheersland \u2043 Trustfi\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWEBSITE : [https://chirpley.ai/](https://chirpley.ai/)",

Loyal holder's of Royal BNB will always gain a massive 15% ROI automatically sent to their wallets in BNB without the hassle of claiming every 30 minutes.\n\nNot only accumulating the highest BNB deposit on the market, it also has a new feature called ROYAL THRUST, we believe this is the next big solidity code revolution.\n\nSo what do we mean by the Royal Thrust, it is an intelligent piece of algorithm which takes data points of each dip and waits to buy up the threshold point until limit is reached. This gives a sky-rocketing shot at green candles every time the system kicks in.\n\nThis is the first ever type of code ever deployed on Binance Smart Chain and its new feature makes this token completely unique.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\ud83d\udc51 Royal Advantages**\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 15% Auto BNB Rewards every 30 minutes\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 Audited Contract\n\n\ud83d\udd10 Locked Liquidity\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Only 5% Marketing Wallet and no other wallets\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udeb7 Bot free group, yes the numbers might be low but 100% genuine investors, we are keen to engage real people who understands what it is like to be treated like a Royal, so what are you waiting for?\n\nJoin Royal BNB with other Royals, it certainly is a Royal extravaganza \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude80\n\nFor the BNB Rewards, you won't need to connect your wallet, it'll go to your wallet automatically, and 15% redistributed to holders every 30 minutes. Yes you heard that right, the most amount of reflection you will have ever seen in the history of all coins.\n\nThis is exactly why we are hyped about Royal BNB \ud83d\udc51\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\n20% Total Tax\n\n15% to BNB Rewards pool\n\n3% liquidity pool\n\n2% ROYAL-THRUST\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Presale Details**\n\nEveryone will get fair chance to participate. There will be no whitelisting of addresses. Bots will be restricted.\n\nSoft Cap: 100 BNB\n\nHard Cap: 200 BNB\n\nMinimum allocation per person: 0.1 BNB\n\nMaximum allocation per person: 3 BNB\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pancakeswap listing:** Listing will be available 6-24 hours after Dxsale, once required amount of BNBs are raised & DXSale time is ended.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Official Links**\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Website: [https://royalBNB.net](https://royalBNB.net)\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 Telegram: [https://t.me/royalbnbofficial](https://t.me/royalbnbofficial)\n\n\ud83d\udc26 Twitter: [https://twitter.com/royalbnb](https://twitter.com/royalbnb)",

Actually, it's a lot of work just to go from website to website looking for information, learning, and trying to make money while you're still here. Time is the most precious commodity in our lives. Everything you want is yours if you use it correctly.\n\nWhy not seek help if you don't know where to begin and can't decide which instruments to invest in? Do not be apprehensive about asking for help. Or maybe you could take use of AI? This is not a joke. Aggregators and procedures for simplifying the processes that annoy and impede have previously been developed by others. For example, consider the Goldfingr. Physical, digital, and meta-investing platforms are all part of the package. It is, of course, accessible through GFT token and enables decision-making from a single app. Like social networks geared for traders and investors, it shares several elements. It's not a new system, but it was one of the first to be put into place.\n\nUsing a single deApp, you have access to all of your assets, as well as the broadcasts of well-known investors. They plan to start the token sale in the next two weeks, and we can all watch the action unfold or participate in some way.",

            "text": "Ecology and non-renewable resources are the main problem of modern society. Every day we burn millions of tons of wood, coal, oil, while very much polluting the atmosphere. And all this is done in order that we have energy, all the usual light in homes, on the streets and automotive energy. Few people these days think about the extraction of clean energy.\n\nThe development of crypto-currency technologies will allow developers to create an entirely new way of mining, renewable and environmentally friendly electric energy. One of such innovative developers was the guys and their project Eloncity . They have founded a platform that fully works on ***Blockchain*** technology . The main goal and goal of the developers of this platform is to create a decentralized platform that will generate the required amount of electricity with the help of modern innovative micro grids. They plan to create tens of millions of such processes around the world. The energy that will be produced by the system of these guys will be available around the world and around the clock. This feature allows Eloncity compete and even surpass modern utilities.\n\nThe cost of this technology will be calculated automatically using the technology of free charging of electrical resources. People around the world will be able to use these technologies, because this platform will work the same for any country, with access to all services of the project.\n\n# What is Eloncity?\n\nThe developers of the ***Eloncity*** project ***have*** set themselves a fairly complex but achievable task. The technology used by the guys has long been not new, and is very often used in modern electrical networks. But the developers of the project went further, they implemented the ***Blockchain*** technology with some improvements, which allowed them to make their platform and almost free electricity available to everyone. At the same time, the generated energy does not expend any natural or human resources, the whole system works completely autonomously and consists of tens of millions of special microsets.\n\nAll electricity generated will be distributed through dedicated output networks, to which any user can connect without problems and use the resources provided. With such a huge potential, this system can easily and naturally compete with existing electrical distribution networks. Any user, absolutely free of charge and safely can use the services provided, and develop their own electrical energy.\n\nFor more information visit [https://eloncity.io/](https://eloncity.io/)",

Institutional Investors and members can subscribe to get trusted analysis from their preferred crypto analysts.\n\n* ICO projects and crypto developers can promote their ICOs, tokens, coins on the platform, generating revenue. This promoted content will not disrupt user experience. We do not intend to allow banners and pop-ups in the name of promotion.\n\n* The Utrum Marketplace will collect one percent (1%) of the transaction fee to buy and sell crypto-related services.\n\n* An additional five percent (5%) of APR rewards will be given to token holders for an eight-week vesting period.\n\n* Utrum revenue will be shared with the community in the form of content rewards. Our primary focus is to sustain the platform long-term.\n\n* There will be a two-week lock period to release pay-outs to contributors.\n\n* Reward pay-outs will be primarily paid from platform revenues. If the platform revenues are low, pay-outs are then made from the 50% reward reserve pool. As the platform grows, the system will sustain on revenues and inflation will be very low. ",

            "text": "\nI believe they will in the long run. Currently, the entire space is in its infancy. Every use case is largely speculative, and most of the ICOs that took place in 2017 during the bull run were quickly cashed out to fiat. Some things will start to happen as communities form around the token's utility rather than pure speculation. Blockchains are merely a component of a much larger meal, not the entire meal.\n\nDecentralized networks, for example, are proving to be beneficial in terms of both economics and personal security. Many of these decentralised networks require human resources to operate, and blockchains can act as an incentive by rewarding utility tokens (a bunch of projects are doing this now). \n\nIn comparison to DHTs, they can also provide a more secure form of identity verification in distributed systems. However, we must address the issue of energy consumption, as the cost of blockchain computation has historically been quite high.\n\nWe're almost there.\nHowever, if every ICO is just a whitepaper and a token sale, we will never see widespread blockchain adoption.\n\n Thankfully, regulations are tightening to try to clean up the space a bit, but most \"companies\" in the crypto space that do ICOs have historically had nothing more than a whitepaper and a simple mission statement, and as a result, they've raised insane amounts of money. \n\nConsumers are unconcerned about this. They are concerned with the amount of value that can be realised (time savings, cost savings, convenience, etc). Nothing, like any other business, can replace good old-fashioned hustle.\n\nEven telecommunications companies, such as Elite, the first and only telco to do so, are adopting blockchain technology which has its own elysium community with NFTs from international influencers.\n\nThey're also working on a platform for users and influencers, which I believe is fantastic.\n\nMy particular favourite is the brave browser, which revolutionises consumer engagement by allowing you to earn bat tokens by watching advertising. In the future, I believe the Brave browser will gain in popularity. In this viewpoint, Web3 is the logical next step. Unlike in the past, creators desire more control over their professions. Their work will not be monetized on YouTube, and it will not be copied and pasted into Instagram.\n\n\nLet's wait and see what the future has in store!!",

Check below market challenges faced by users and their provided solutions by Javvy.\n\nExchange security: We all know, nowadays one of the biggest problems in the crypto world is of Exchanges sites. Most of them have some negative feedback about their site. Security of sites is getting the break.  \nCrypto wallet: Since starting crypto wallets are developed to store and send & receive cryptocurrencies. It was a basic feature of any crypto wallet. Even still most of the wallets are doing the same. They are just very simple and added with some basic guides on how to use.  \nWallets are limited: Currently, most of the wallets are limited in numbers of cryptos supported on them. Most of the wallets have Bitcoin, Litcoin, Ethereum and doge wallets.  \nSolutions provided by the Javvy team for the current problems. Solutions and Features are discussed below:\n\nThe Javvy team is developing crypto wallet and Decentralized crypto exchange which supports FIAT currencies for doing the trade of cryptos/tokens. ID verification (only when required) (KYC type). As mentioned in whitepaper Javvy will support crypto users from 170 countries will get the benefit of project/platform. This is not web based exchange or project so it will reduce the cost and time of team and users. Javvy supports Bitcoin, Ethereum and the Javvy tokens and moreover after ICO ends they will add top 500 coins and 50+ vetted tokens. Payment methods like the pre-paid debit card, eCheck or bank transfers are supported on a project.\n\nEncrypted private keys for/on exch device and backup method for Private Keys.\n\nEnforce to add secure passwords.\n\nCrypto hardwares like Trezor and Ledger are supported.\n\nAuthentication through mobile, SMS and 2FA available.\n\nFor some limited use you don\u2019t need to register on Javvy\u2019s site. You can send, receive, convert or manage the crypto\u2019s without getting registered on site. ID verification or KYC is only required for some advanced features like Buy and sell of crypto though FIAT and to participate in ICO or STO\u2019s within the platform. You can join your favorite ICO from Javvy APP.\n\n[https://javvy.com/](https://javvy.com/)",

Unlike other projects, Javvy is a wallet application and exchange that combines security and a user-friendly interface. \n\nJavvy argues that the future of crypto money will be based on application. Therefore Javvy application and crypto exchange are designed in a structure that includes the highest level of security solutions.

When you're offline in the Javvy wallet app, your cryptocurrency wallet also goes offline. This ensures that your crypto coins are always safe, unlike other security solutions.\n*  Javvy saves users the trouble of losing the private key. With the display seed feature, your private key is always secure and accessible.\n* Javvy uses cold storage wallet technology to provide maximum security to its users with the security features of its decentralized structure.\n* Javvy will provide its users with a new generation of security measures by providing solutions ahead of the market in terms of security.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mf0epcam95o21.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=a04f2b989eb49396793b900e917ef45c8588006b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJavvy is a project designed to meet all the needs of cryptocurrency users and is designed to be user-friendly.

Just another way this working towards long term growth! The Dev has bigger announcements and plans but everything has to be worked out and done right which he has done right from the beginning! We've proven that this is here for the long haul, that his name and business is on the line! And rewards are the best in the crypto space. Everything you'd want in still a new project! 99% of all projects you can get into wouldn't give you that much security! We are still building the foundation with alot of money to made for all long term holders! Like I said before I can't wait for 6 months from now.... 6 years from now! Think bigger!!!!! Let's have a great day Greenlyght family!",

It functions similarly to a crypto voucher.\nAs long as you have it in your wallet, you will get discounts at the\npartner restaurants, hotels or caf\u00e8s.\nAs an example, our partner involved, Paul, the owner of Rollin Smoke BBQ\nwill offer a 10% discount for every product to clients that purchase HRC tokens\nand stack them for at least 30 days.\nThere will be a QR code scan system for the clients\u2019 crypto wallet. If you\nshow a proof of having the token stacked in your wallet, you'll get the\ndiscount instantly - it's that simple!\n\nThe partners involved:\n\nSome of our partners are well-known companies, such as Belgium's La Boucherie S.A. is a butcher shop that has been in business since 1985,\nspecializing in high-quality meats for professionals as well as private sales.\nLa Boucherie S.A., which operates over 600 restaurants across Belgium\nand France, will offer benefits to all of its customers in order to boost the\ntoken's value.\nIn the 'partners' section of the website you can find all of our partners' offers.\nThe offers provided are scalable\n\nDeflationary token:\n\nFor a better balance, we create HORECA token to be deflationary to work\nfor token holders\u2019 benefit.\n\n Therefore, each transaction goes into:\n\n- 2% distributed to token holders\n- 1% buyback & burn. Burning after buyback so funds automatically enter the liquidity pool\n\nHORECA Tokenomics:\n\nTotal supply: 40 billion HRC\n\n1st presale: 2 billion HRC\n\nBurn: 5 cycles x 5% each\n\nToken allocation: \n\n75% in liquidity (locked 6 months)\n\n10% in development\n\n8% team\n\n5% legal\n\n2% charity\n\nWebsite: [Horeca Crypto](http://www.horeca-crypto.com)",

Locked Liquidity, its utility, and community based roadmap.\n\n**3% Reflection Reward**  \nAs a dedicated holder of COLI, any time someone from the group sells, all remaining holders will receive a portion of a 3% fee levied against the transaction. This means not only do you enjoy the benefits of price appreciation, you also get a small cut from anyone who exits the ecosystem.\n\n**Automatic Buybacks 5%**  \nFor every transaction, the contract executes a 5% buyback fee. This serves two purposes: The first is to help push the price higher by automatically buying back tokens that are sold off, and pouring them into the liquidity pool. The second is to reduce the overall supply of tokens, which consequently make the circulating supply more valuable. This immensely benefits long term holders.\n\n**Marketing Budget 2%**  \nTo help promote the token, secure endorsement deals, and place advertisements, a small 2% transactional fee is applied to help cover such expenses. It can't be overstated how beneficial all three pillars are to the continued and sustained growth of COLI.\n\n**Proprietary DEX (Coming Soon)**  \n***SpartanSwap***\\*\\*:\\*\\* A place where you can stake your COLI\n\n**Proprietary Wallet (Coming Soon)**  \n***Coli wallet:*** A spartan-themed crypto wallet to safely preserve your tokens and having your rewards delivered to you directly.\n\n**Online PVP Video Game (Coming Soon)**  \nYou don't have to sit idle waiting for the market to pump.

Due to be released very soon!\n\nTradeStrike Lite \n\nThe first of their products, TradeStrike Lite, is currently in a \u2018soft launch\u2019 phase. This means that only the staking feature is now live, boasting a minimum of 10% APY, potentially rising to 20% depending on the total number of coins staked. The 20% for 30 days previously mentioned will be honoured upon launch of v2 of the DEX. This is to allow the team time to release the product exactly as they expect and iron out any bugs and flaws.\n\nCurrently over 80% of the circulating supply have been staked! \n\nWith the v2 of the DEX, we can expect a full overhaul with a host of new features, including the anticipated integration of Chainlink Price Feeds - which will be used across all of their future products to ensure premium data quality and reliable benchmarks as they expand towards cross chain compatibility. \n\nThe v2 will also allow farming at a rate of 50% APY, given an equal value of BNB would be expected to contribute towards the Liquidity Pool.\n\nSkynet and Certik Shield \n\nAs the leading name in crypto security, TradeStrike have not only acquired the services of Certik to audit their DEX, they will also be using their Skynet and Certik Shield services. This provides 24/7 security monitoring and insurance of any lost or stolen assets. \n\n\nStrikeX Wallet \n\nEarlier this year it was announced that their DeFi wallet was fully funded and development was well under way through the appointment of Antier Solutions, a highly regarded blockchain development company. Today there was a teaser released and is expected to be released early 2022. Have a look at their socials for a sneak peek of their User Interface and visuals.\n\nIt was revealed that the StrikeX Wallet would be fully integrated with the TradeStrike Lite DEX and contain portfolio performance tracking & charting.\n\nThe Wallet also boasts instant fiat deposits and withdrawals. This includes compatibility with Visa, MasterCard and ApplePay. \n\nIn terms of security, you will be able to access to your crypto wallet swiftly and securely with their in-built biometric login.\n\nTradeStrike \n\nThe main platform which is due for release Q4 2022 of which $STRX will be the native token. This will allow 24/7 trading of crypto, stocks, NFTs & real-estate through the use of Tokenisation and blockchain technology, which is tipped to be a huge industry in the coming years. Working along side one of the biggest law firms on the planet, Latham & Watkins, to ensure regulatory compliance from the start. \n\nWe can expect an update on this early 2022, once the StrikeX wallet is smoothly up and running. \n\nExchange Listings\n\nRecently STRX has begun been listing on  multiple centralised exchanges, providing much more exposure and ease of purchase of the coin. So far, this includes ProBit and BitMart, with others expected very soon! \n\nNew Appointments \n\nThe team have really started to show their intentions with some high profile appointments in the company. \n\nThe first of which being Rob Clark, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), who boasts an extensive background across storage, infrastructure systems, networking, security and dev-ops. \n\nThe second being their newly appointed Chief Security Officer (CSO), who we can expect more details on very soon! \n\nLinks & Information\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/Trade_Strike\n\n\nI encourage you all to do your own research and pop into the socials for a chat, where the devs and team are very active.",

In short, most of the existing crypto wallets force users to register with affiliated, third-party vendors, requiring them to provide a plethora of personal and confidential documents.\n\nBoth, existing crypto wallets and exchanges are predominantly based in the United States and are severely limited by regulatory restrictions. None of them are able to easily pivot to move outside of the United States, to overcome these limitations, because the terms and conditions of the US-based startup incubators and fundraising platforms all require them to form as and remain US-based companies. Breaking those agreements will be next to impossible, leaving forward-thinking companies, such as Javvy, that are registered outside of the United States, with a significant competitive advantage.  \n\n\n[https://javvy.com/](https://javvy.com/)",

Without a wallet, they won't be able to access their crypto assets as long as their assets are stored in the blockchain. This also applies to clearing & trading services. A centralized exchange is prone to hack because they use a hot/cold wallet that in theory, only 'owned' by the exchanges. Users can't control it because they don't hold the private key even though there is a personal address.\n\n\ufffc\nDAEX Smart Wallet relations to the platform.\n\nTo solve that problem and to ensure exchange can still guarantee that the right user is accessing that wallet, in theory, we have to use a wallet where exchange can identify that the right user is using that address. At the same time, we have to make sure that user still controls the wallet and their digital assets. This is where DAEX comes in.\n\nDAEX introduce a smart wallet that is able to maintain a wide range of digital assets and at the same time maintain the 'trust' between the user, exchange, and DAEX platform itself. Every user will have a single wallet that is connected to the clearing blockchain and exchange on-top of DAEX clearing platform. And this wallet will have the multiple private key features.\n\nDAEX project team says it is going to provide a better infrastructure for the cryptocurrency trading industry by taking the reasonable parts of the mainstream securities trading industry and by taking advantages of new opportunities brought about by the distributed ledger technology. Specifically, trading and clearing will be separated into different entities. Current centralized exchanges will continue to provide trading service. But the clearing work will be handled over to a common clearing service which is based on the DAEX solution. But, different from current centralized clearing services, the DAEX clearing service is based on distributed ledger technology. The distributed ledger technology guarantees that trades are correctly and safely cleared and settled. By using distributed ledger technology, trader\u2019s assets are kept in their own accounts on the blockchain\n\nRead more : https://www.daex.io/daexPaper.do",

However, at present the wider adoption of cryptocurrencies is hindered by market volatility and account vulnerability. \n\nGigzi is a revolutionary \ufb01nancial system that addresses these challenges. By harnessing the relative constancy of precious metals and utilising world leading iris recognition technology, Gigzi provides investors with stability, security and wealth protection. \n\nThe Gigzi ecosystem is formed of decentralised crypto-assets - Gigzi Black (GZB) and Gigzi Metal, comprising Gigzi Platinum (GZP), Gold (GZG) and Silver (GZS) - that are supported by three core applications; a Wallet secured by iris recognition technology, an Exchange and a Treasury. \n\n**Gigzi Black (GZB**) is backed by market con\ufb01dence. It is distinctive in its Gold Rewards programme, whereby, users holding Gigzi Black at the end of a reward cycle are paid Gigzi Gold crypto-assets. This ensures users are invested in the Gigzi ecosystem and share in its success. \n\nGigzi Metal is stable and secure; this is achieved by anchoring the price to precious metal. 1 Gigzi Metal is equal to 1 gram of its respective precious metal. The tokenisation of precious metals by Gigzi provides users with a stable asset in which to invest their wealth on the blockchain, as well as enabling users to hedge and limit exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency market. The world-renowned Perth Mint has been chosen to provide the precious metal that backs Gigzi Metal crypto-assets.\n\nThe Gigzi Wallet application supports major cryptocurrencies and enables users to easily manage funds stored on the blockchain. In conjunction with iris recognition technology, developed with IriTech - the world\u2019s leading iris biometric security provider, the Wallet provides unrivalled account security. \n\n**Gigzi Exchange** facilitates transactions and exchanges between Gigzi crypto-assets and any supported cryptocurrency or \ufb01at money. This inter-operability is a signi\ufb01cant feature of the Gigzi ecosystem. Gigzi Metal crypto-assets may be redeemed for gold or silver cast bars at the Gigzi Treasury.\n\n**Gigzi** has been in development for over two years. Phases completed include system architecture design, Smart Contract development and formalisation of partnership with IriTech. Therefore, at the point of launch and crowd sale \u2013 Gigzi is only months away from delivering the full system architecture and functionality to its users. \n\nGigzi will change the way in which wealth is stored, traded and protected. It provides a complete and decentralised \ufb01nancial system; empowering users through \ufb01nancial independence and security. \n\n[https://www.gigzi.com/](https://www.gigzi.com/)",

Keep it secret, keep it safe.\n\nA project that will prevent us from using many wallets by supporting all the main crypto currencies and all transactions. In short, we can also call it a multi-wallet system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow with the development of technology, many innovations have entered our lives. People don't say that I need to get things from one place to another and now they are looking for things they can find all in the same place, so they want to make their lives easier now. Because if they don't make their lives easier, they won't be able to keep up with speed. I told you the reason, because the Javvy project gave us all the benefits in the same way. In other words, by providing easy access to all things related to crypto, it facilitates our lives and work. That why i have taken it upon myself to introduce Javvy to the Cryptocurrency community and the world at large it usefulness and hpw it works.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow it works\n\nJavvy is the first project that supports many coins alone. Using a single wallet instead of using multiple wallets is a project that will eliminate many problems. The positive reflection that will be added to our lives will be quite high. One of the biggest features that makes Javvy successful is security. In terms of security, javvy has worked very successfully and has integrated it into the 2FA system (Two-Step Authentication) to protect us from many hacking attacks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [https://javvy.com/](https://javvy.com/)\n\nBounty0x Username: Elmichaels  ",

All BNB stays in the prize pool to build more prizes that can be awarded. At this moment, Gio (the owner) is working out a way to win an NFT if you buy a certain amount of tickets and didn't win the Giveaway prize so you can still win even if you didn't win the giveaway prize. Ticket prizes include $100 gift cards to: PSN, Steam, Amazon and Spotify. \n\nThe NFT marketplace is close to finished and will include some really cool options including rarity grades. You will be able to see the  percentages of getting each rarity grade for the mystery box minting. There will be different values for each of the different rarity grades. The GreenChart marketplace will be where you will be able to mint your BSC NFTs. However, you will be able to sell them on a number of different NFT marketplaces for BSC NFTs.  There will also be ETH NFTs on OpenSea available for minting.\n\nGreenChart is aDeFi project with many utilities that is continually expanding.\n\nGreenChart will launch an Investment channel for serious projects rather than a call channel like many out there.  The Green Lounge, the channel,  will be hosting guests such as devs of other projects that meet the same qualifications to be listed on the GreenPad. \n\nGreenPad, launched a few days ago, is a utility platform that offers investment opportunities of solid projects on BSC, ETH, and CRO networks that have met strict requirements for listing. GreenPad also offers staking, marketing, and NFT marketplace services to projects on those networks.  \n\nThe sale on GreenPad for the 18th of April is under talks with the dev of that project on the CRO chain. For those that have held GC for a period of time and have not sold will be eligible for the whitelist of the presale. The whitelists for other projects will be based on what the devs feels comfortable to give to GreenChart investors. The idea is to avoid investors that are looking to pump and dump, instead attract serious long term investors. More details will be announced closer to the presale date for whitelisting. \n\nThe NFT Marketplace, the GreenPad with (staking and marketing options) and The Green Lounge will be the base utilities for the GreenChart Ecosystem to start. More utilities will roll out as time goes on. The NFTs specifically is the next focus area as they will be unique as you will soon see and we have plans for utility with them. \n\n**Telegram** group: http://t.me/greenchartbsc  \n**Website** information http://Green-chart.com\n\n**Contract:** 0x7403802c0FFeE2d83FB13513e23aAF4a3a9C69f0",

Selling and establishing price records for paintings, pictures, collages, gif-animations, and music.\n\nIn my opinion, there is one event in the NFT market that is critical to the integration of the online and on-chain worlds. Gaming NFTs are on the rise. Players clearly want games where they can design their own characters, weapons, and other items. Gamers with upgraded artifacts are increasing in number, despite creators' reluctance. More and more, they want to test their wares on a new platform and see how they stack up against those of a rival player and his artifacts. Tokenized artifacts, I believe, are NFT's best hope for the future.\n\nPlease note that there are at least 18+ NFTs. Despite the fact that they have a sizable following, they aren't exactly household names. According to me, NFTxCards' concept and release of its features are the most successful. In the future, they will be well-known for their unique selection of hot NFTs. I'm quite sure about that.",

GameFi and play-to-earn are regarded as ways to make money in the virtual world while escaping the problems that beset the real one.\n\nYou have to admit that GameFi was a true breakthrough in that it merged DeFi, NFT, and gaming into a single promising area that is only now getting traction. Take a look at all of the games that have been made available in recent years. They span practically all genres and make us pleased when we learn it's comparable to games we used to enjoy as kids. The new reality has demonstrated that this genre can exist as long as it has a solid foundation. I'm moving more toward the view that such games are only a component of the project, rather than its focal point. I enjoy how this concept was executed in MetaMotor. The project's essence is precisely their 8,888 unique NFTs, which they will be distributing very shortly. The availability of NFTs will enable its owners to play Play2Earn titles such as GTA 5, and thereby earn money by doing so. They already have a server set up where you can play and make money, and I don't think these people are joking. I believe there will be a significant discount on NFTs during the presale, and I intend to get them since I appreciate what they do and how they do it.",

            "text": " \n\nInvesting in digital art is one of the hotly debated trends in intellectual property. Not only venerable artists or popular singers, but also those who yesterday were not at all well known, have started to make money in the virtual world. Paintings, photos, collages, gif-animations, and music are successfully selling and setting price records.\n\nPersonally, I am waiting for one event in the NFT market, which I consider extremely important in the merging of the two worlds - online and onchain. It is the emergence of gaming NFTs. There is an obvious market demand for games where you can come with your own characters, weapons, etc. While developers are holding back, the number of gamers with pumped up artifacts is growing year by year. And they are more and more eager to try out their arsenal on a new site, to use in a competition with another gamer and his artifacts. I am confident that the future of NFT is in games that accept tokenized artifacts.\n\nI think it is important to say that it is now so popular 18+ NFTs. They do have a large audience and are showing growth and popularity. I consider the NFTxCards project to be the most successful in terms of the idea and release of their features. They have created a unique collection of hot NFTs and will become popular in the future, I am 100% sure of it.",

Last year, they started hosting contests for traders of varying skill levels. Even my mother was able to play in the \"game\" since the rules were so simple. In the ranking table, I observed that all wishfuls had paid the little entrance fees and were listed publicly. It was a creative way to lose money while having fun, lol, for greedy and impulsive traders like myself. I'm no longer enthused by the prospect of the future.\n\nThat's why I decided to witness the first event and make a choice about my future participation. It seemed as if the members were constantly adjusting their places on the table. As a result, the community was able to see their return on investment. What was happening was also obvious to everybody. At first, I was surprised and a little pleased with myself. This time around, I'll be competing in a tournament that has a prize fund of roughly 5,000 BUSD. Doesn't that seem like a large amount to you? However, the fact of the matter is that I have won! It wasn't that difficult, to be honest. I don't know whether it's due to my opponents, or if it's just a matter of good fortune. Despite this, I had a good time.\n\nUnique tournaments, with higher rewards and more competitors, have been announced by these individuals. In the meanwhile, a set number of various grade NFTs will be issued, guaranteeing participation in these tournaments, up to 55% APY (!) and, of course, a share of the prize pool. They will be.\n\nIf you understand what I'm talking about, you'll be interested in it. The number of NFTs is now being lowered by up to 30%.",

It\u2019s packed with a full variety of engaging features such as its own completely community-driven economy.\n\nIf you\u2019re able to recall that in the middle of June we announced our first game on the blockchain, Arsenal. Now, we\u2019re happy to reveal the official Beta version of Arsenal is here. We will soon be ready with the grand main net launch of Arsenal.\n\nAbout Arsenal\n\nArsenal is a 3D First Person Shooter multiplayer game for the Fabwelt Gaming Ecosystem and Metaverse. It's fully playable as a WebGL game on your browser. It has a \u201cbattleground\u201d look and feels and it\u2019s fully integrated with blockchain technology. It utilizes in-game NFTs as assets, collectibles, and utilities. Pay to Play and Play to Earn is integrated in such a way, it attracts everyday players as well as professional players around the world, to get incentives and fun. Many different types of maps are included like big maps for sniping, and small maps for fast close combat.\n\nArsenal Ecosystem\n\nEntering Arsenal\n\nTo enter Arsenal a minimum amount of staking 1000 WELT is needed. A gamer can choose 3 types of P2E scenarios: Free Play, Automated Tournaments, and Fabwelt Tournaments.\n\nFree Play\n\nGamers can create new rooms or can join existing Free Playrooms. Points can be earned by various methods Headshot, killstreak, kill, winning the match, etc. Points can be claimed as WELT tokens.\n\nAutomated Tournaments\n\nAutomated tournaments are 24/7 tournaments organized automatically within Arsenal. They are randomly selecting maps and game types. There is always a tournament available. Every player pays WELT tokens to enter. The prize pools exist out of the total amount of paying players minus 10% for P2E & Staking wallet. The winner of the game can claim the prize pool.\n\nFabwelt Tournaments\n\nFabwelt will organize big tournaments every month. Gamers that want to participate in these tournaments will pay WELT tokens, and depending on the Tournament style, staking WELT is needed. Prize pools exist out of the total amount of paying players minus 10% for P2E & Staking wallet plus Fabwelt Bonus.\n\nThe Future is bright!\n\nFabwelt is set to release a range of fantastic features bundled with stunning graphics in a 3D FPS game experience. With a variety of game options, including combat, more maps, staking opportunities, and other in-game NFTs, Fabwelt will bring in the new age of high-end games in the Play to Earn world.\n\nThe game\u2019s in-game NFT trading function is truly enhancing the game\u2019s depth of play, and along with the strategic gameplay, we\u2019d like to think that there\u2019s at least something for everyone to appreciate in Arsenal.\n\nMany new features and updates are all already line up to keep pushing Arsenal forward. For now a WebGL game, but to really push the graphics Arsenal will become available as a standalone desktop installation. Some features already mentioned on our channels that will be added are a Clan system, Ranking/Level system, NFTs as weapons and skins, and new game modes.\n\nWe\u2019re extremely excited about the BETA launch. Hope you enjoy the game!\n\nARSENAL BETA: [arsenal.fabwelt.com](https://arsenal.fabwelt.com/)\n\nLinks: [https://linktr.ee/Fabwelt](https://linktr.ee/Fabwelt)",

Flokishima is going to create the fusion needed to fuel our dynamic community on our BSC mission.\n\nOur presale is being marketed with experience and power to generate the most interest that is possible for the project. We have Messiah launching us along with an ongoing Weibo campaign and this is just the start.\n\nThe future?\n\nWe have a team of experienced marketeers, both in and out of the BSC space. Pairing this along with a substantial marketing budget for billboards, adverts, and influencer partnerships, we are sure we\u2019re going to be taking off, Poocoin Weibo twitter and multiple coinvote sites already up and running! Nfts and a game platform that is already in the early stages of development and will be with you along this amazing journey.\n\nKeep your eyes open, this is going BIG!\n\nHow to find us\n\nTelegram - https://t.me/FlokishimaOfficial\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/flokishima\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/p/CVGKxNcoc0r/?utm\\_medium=copy\\_link\n\nWebsite - https://flokishima.finance/\n\nWhat are the tokenomics?\n\nFairly simple; there is a 12% total transaction fee compromising of:\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 3% distributed to all holders.\n\nNot only do you get to be part of the newest movement, you get rewarded every time someone buys or sells. Every buy and sell 3% gets paid to our holders in reflections. In short, the longer you hold the more tokens you earn.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 3% added to the liquidity pool\n\nThe contract accumulates tokens on buy/sells and then adds them to the liquidity pool to create a solid price floor and increases the stability of the token for everyone's benefit!\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 6% sent to a house wallet\n\nA token is nothing without it\u2019s marketing power and development team. Not only do we have a substantial budget to start, we want the snowball to keep the momentum. We have a large sum of funds set aside and some very generous offerings from the doge community. Following initial advertisements and presale, we want multiple exchange listings and celebrity endorsements to help with rocket fuel for the moon.\n\nWhat else?\n\nFloishima is fully against rug pulls and honey pots, so he\u2019s decided to give the community as much confidence as possible by:\n\nLocked liquidity\n\nRemoving functions that could cause a honeypot from the contract and keep our investors protected\n\nNo separate dev or whale wallets that could crash the price\n\nGetting a smart contract audit very soon\n\nAs soon as the world starts to know what Flokishima is doing, nothing can stop us. Join us, spread the word and enjoy your the ride \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

Recently I've come across a project that sparked my interest, it's called SeedSwap, let me introduce you to it.\n\nSeedSwap is a DeFi project that aims to reward liquidity stakers with yields that have a compounding multipliers based on positive farming habits. Rewards will include tokens, NFTs, and NFT discounts. They are also planning on having an NFT exchange with fees competitive with Rarible and OpenSea at 2.5%. While there are decent rewards for stakers on their roadmap in their whitepaper is says they will have a token buyback program with the revenue generated with the NFT exchange. The token supply will also be deflationary as in the discount program 55% of tokens redeemed for NFTs will be burned. Most of this stuff is talked about in more technical detail in the whitepaper.\n\nI've joined their Telegram and have talked to some of the team member, the lead dev has doxxed himself and they have put up a Github for transparency reasons, so it gives me some confidence in the project. If you want to know more about the tokenomics it's summarized on their website. If you're interested in talking to them, they're pretty active on their telegram, there's a link to join it on the website.\n\nThe project is currently in Pre-Sale/ILO and has raised 30% of the ILO goal (128ETH) as of the writing of this post, the ILO ends on 03/17/2020.\n\nWebsite: [https://SeedSwap.io](https://SeedSwap.io)  \nWhitepaper: [https://seedswap.io/lib/files/wp/wp.pdf](https://seedswap.io/lib/files/wp/wp.pdf)  \nILO: [https://www.unicrypt.network/amm/uni/ilo/0x4cC177CCE7e533D3f7189Bac202Ad86107a8FD45](https://www.unicrypt.network/amm/uni/ilo/0x4cC177CCE7e533D3f7189Bac202Ad86107a8FD45)",
