They have free withdrawals and deposits with lightning.",

As i'm writing this you could probably just send to the LNURL that you pasted on the card huh. Sorry this is still a bit new to me.  \n\n\nEdit:\n\nI'm also assuming setting up you're own node would be more private and you wouldn't need to load the card since it would be connected to you're node and thus funds already?",

You need to setup a server to receive the LNURL-Widthrawal request and set it up with your node. Basically replicating what CoinCorner or ln.cash and other services offer to you.\n\nHere's some more reading material:\n\nhttps://github.com/chill117/lnurl-node\n\nhttps://developers.opennode.com/docs/generate-lnurl-withdrawal\n\nhttps://docs.lnpay.co/api/lnurl-withdraw/disposable-lnurl-withdraw\n\nHere's some discussion in BTCPayServer about how to implement this:\nhttps://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver/discussions/1692\n\nAnd here's specification:\nhttps://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc\n\nThere's a lot of activity in this area at the moment.",
