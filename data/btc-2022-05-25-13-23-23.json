            "selftext": "Bitcoin needs to increase transaction throughput to stay relevant and to stay the dominant crypto currency for the future, and for today.This needs to happen either on the main net, or on a secondary layer that does not require you to lock your coins. Your coins have to be able to be spent freely whenever you want, Cheaply, and fast. Without compromising on safety.Is this possible?Should we increase the block size to do it on the main net? What block size would we need for bitcoin to run with a average transaction cost under 1 cent. I think 1 cent is a good transaction roof if you want to be able to use bitcoin for everything and anything. How much could we raise the block size without compromising safety or peoples ability to run their own full node?\n\nOr what could be done (maybe with a second layer) to be able to spend your coins freely, fast and cheaply without locking them up in for example a lightening network channel?  \nThe problem i see is that if you lock your funds in a channel you cant access them if you need to send to someone not in the network. And you cant withdraw your funds to cash (fiat) without completely closing the channel.  \nAllso there is a cost to opening a channel, and if you have paychecks that you deposit regulary you would have to open new channels regularly and/or close the old ones as you go.\n\nMy base thesis is that for a network to be used as daily money, you would need the following:  \nFast (instant) transfer.  \nFees under 1 cent (Fast educated guess)  \nYour money needs to be available to you at any time.  \nIt needs to be safe.\n\nFull disclaimer, i know about the block war, i know about bitcoin cash, i know about the lightening network. This post is made because people are not using bitcoin, and i want to find the problem that causes it, and i want to find the solution to solve it. I think i know some of the problems, but i want to find the solutions, and maybe more of the problems (if there are any more).\n\nI tried posting this in r/Bitcoin, but it did not go well so im posting it here to hopefully get more constructive responses.",
