            "selftext": "This FAQ and information thread serves to inform both new and existing users about common Bitcoin topics that readers coming to this Bitcoin subreddit may have. This is a living and breathing document, which will change over time. If you have suggestions on how to change it, please comment below or message the mods.\n\n-----\n\n**What is \\/r/btc?**\n\nThe \\/r/btc reddit community was originally created as a community to discuss bitcoin. It quickly gained momentum in August 2015 when the bitcoin block size debate heightened. On the legacy \\/r/bitcoin subreddit it was discovered that moderators were heavily censoring discussions that were not inline with their own opinions.\n\nOnce realized, the subreddit subscribers began to openly question the censorship [which led to](http://archive.is/0G8az) thousands of redditors being banned from the \\/r/bitcoin subreddit. A large number of redditors switched to other subreddits such as /r/bitcoin_uncensored and /r/btc. For a run-down on the history of censorship, please read [A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in /r/bitcoin by John Blocke](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43) and [/r/Bitcoin Censorship, Revisted by John Blocke](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/r-bitcoin-censorship-revisited-58d5b1bdcd64). As yet another example, \\/r/bitcoin [censored 5,683 posts and comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/7414nf/september_2017_stats_post/) just in the month of September 2017 alone. This shows the sheer magnitude of censorship that is happening, which continues to this day. [Read a synopsis of /r/bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/) to get the full story and a complete understanding of [why people are so upset](https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/5gvqf6/and_now_for_something_completely_different_the/) with \\/r/bitcoin's censorship. Further reading can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/83vgdm/a_collection_of_evidence_regarding_bitcoins/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/cpftea/its_important_to_remember_the_past_and_show/ewp7abj/) with a giant collection of information regarding these topics.\n\n-----\n\n**Why is censorship bad for Bitcoin?**\n\nAs demonstrated above, censorship has become prevalent in almost all of the major Bitcoin [communication channels](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5mxov4/wtf_north_koreas_cgc_tries_to_control_bitcoin/dc78hwl/). The [impacts of censorship in Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5cxx8t/the_impacts_of_censorship/) are very real. \"Censorship can really hinder a society if it is bad enough. Because media is such a large part of people\u2019s lives today and it is the source of basically all information, if the information is not being given in full or truthfully then the society is left uneducated [...] Censorship is probably the number one way to lower people\u2019s right to freedom of speech.\" By censoring certain topics and [specific words](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5vr7ij/partial_list_of_words_that_automod_removes_from/), people in these Bitcoin communication channels are literally being brain washed into thinking a certain way, molding the reader in a way that they desire; this has a lasting impact especially on users who are new to Bitcoin. Censoring in Bitcoin is the direct opposite of what the spirit of Bitcoin is, and should be condemned anytime it occurs. Also, it's important to [think critically](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5txje0/edward_snowden_the_answer_to_fake_news_is_not/) and [independently](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9cm3nj/psa_the_sub_has_been_under_attack_by_various_bad/), and have an open mind.\n\n-----\n\n**Why do some groups attempt to discredit \\/r/btc?**\n\nThis subreddit has become a place to discuss everything Bitcoin-related and even other cryptocurrencies at times when the topics are relevant to the overall ecosystem. Since this subreddit is one of the few places on Reddit where users will not be censored for their opinions and people are allowed to speak freely, truth is often said here without the fear of reprisal from moderators in the form of bans and censorship. Because of this freedom, people and groups who don't want you to hear the truth with do almost anything they can to try to stop you from speaking the truth and try to manipulate readers here. You can see many cited examples of cases where special interest groups have gone out of their way to attack this subreddit and attempt to disrupt and discredit it. [See the examples here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9cm3nj/psa_the_sub_has_been_under_attack_by_various_bad/)\n\n-----\n\n**What is the goal of \\/r/btc?**\n\nThis subreddit is a diverse community dedicated to the success of bitcoin. \\/r/btc honors the spirit and nature of Bitcoin being a place for open and free discussion about Bitcoin without the interference of moderators. Subscribers at anytime can look at and review the [public moderator logs](https://modlogs.fyi/r/btc). This subreddit does have [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/wiki/index#wiki_rules_for_this_subreddit_.28also_in_the_sidebar.29) as mandated by reddit that we must follow plus a couple of rules of our own. Make sure to **[read the /r/btc wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/wiki/index)** for more information and resources about this subreddit which includes information such as the benefits of Bitcoin, how to get started with Bitcoin, and more.\n\n-----\n\n**What is Bitcoin?**\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency, also called a virtual currency, which can be transacted for a low-cost nearly instantly from anywhere in the world. Bitcoin also powers the blockchain, which is a public immutable and decentralized global ledger. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without the need for any central authority whatsoever. There is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank. Read the Bitcoin whitepaper to further understand the schematics of how Bitcoin works.\n\n-----\n\n**What is Bitcoin Cash?**\n\nBitcoin Cash (ticker symbol: BCH) is an updated version of Bitcoin which solves the scaling problems that have been plaguing Bitcoin Core (ticker symbol: BTC) for years. Bitcoin (BCH) is just a continuation of the Bitcoin project that allows for bigger blocks which will give way to more growth and adoption. You can read more about Bitcoin on [BitcoinCash.org](https://bitcoincash.org/) or read [What is Bitcoin Cash](https://www.bitcoin.com/info/what-is-bitcoin-cash) for additional details.\n\n-----\n\n**How do I buy Bitcoin?**\n\nYou can buy Bitcoin on an exchange or with a brokerage. If you're looking to buy, you can [buy Bitcoin with your credit card](https://buy.bitcoin.com/) to get started quickly and safely. There are several others places to buy Bitcoin too; please check the sidebar under brokers, exchanges, and trading for other go-to service providers to begin buying and trading Bitcoin. Make sure to [do your homework first](https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/how-to-choose-the-right-bitcoin-exchange/) before choosing an exchange to ensure you are choosing the right one for you.\n\n-----\n\n**How do I store my Bitcoin securely?**\n\nAfter the initial step of buying your first Bitcoin, you will need a Bitcoin wallet to secure your Bitcoin. Knowing which Bitcoin wallet to choose is the second most important step in becoming a Bitcoin user. Since you are investing funds into Bitcoin, choosing the right Bitcoin wallet for you is a critical step that shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. [Use this guide to help you choose the right wallet for you](https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/how-to-choose-the-right-bitcoin-wallet/). Check the sidebar under Bitcoin wallets to get started and find a wallet that you can store your Bitcoin in.\n\n-----\n\n**Why is my transaction taking so long to process?**\n\nBitcoin transactions typically confirm in ~10 minutes. A confirmation means that the Bitcoin transaction has been verified by the network through the process known as mining. Once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reversed or double spent. Transactions are included in blocks.\n\nIf you have sent out a Bitcoin transaction and it\u2019s delayed, chances are the [transaction fee](https://bitcoinfees.cash/) you used wasn\u2019t enough to out-compete others causing it to be [backlogged](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,24h). The transaction won\u2019t confirm until it clears the backlog. This typically occurs when using the Bitcoin Core (BTC) blockchain due to poor central planning.\n\nIf you are using Bitcoin (BCH), you shouldn't encounter these problems as the block limits have been raised to accommodate a massive amount of volume freeing up space and lowering transaction costs.\n\n-----\n\n**Why does my transaction cost so much, I thought Bitcoin was supposed to be cheap?**\n\nAs described above, transaction fees have spiked on the Bitcoin Core (BTC) blockchain mainly due to a limit on transaction space. This has created what is called a fee market, which has primarily been a premature artificially induced price increase on transaction fees due to the limited amount of block space available (supply vs. demand). The original plan was for fees to help secure the network when the block reward decreased and eventually stopped, but the plan was not to reach that point until some time in the future, [around the year 2140](https://wiki.bitcoin.com/w/Controlled_supply#Projected_Bitcoins_Long_Term). This original plan was restored with Bitcoin (BCH) where fees are typically less than a single penny per transaction.\n\n-----\n\n**What is the block size limit?**\n\nThe original Bitcoin client didn\u2019t have a block size cap, however was limited to 32MB due to the Bitcoin protocol message size constraint. However, in July 2010 Bitcoin\u2019s creator Satoshi Nakamoto introduced a [temporary 1MB limit](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/103/tree//trunk/main.h?diff=515630145fcbc978e39dbaa5:102) as an anti-DDoS measure. The temporary measure from Satoshi Nakamoto was made clear three months later when Satoshi said the block size limit can be [increased again by phasing it in](https://archive.is/L5yvP#selection-3315.0-3315.7) when it\u2019s needed (when the demand arises). When introducing Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list in 2008, Satoshi said that [scaling to Visa levels](https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography%40metzdowd.com/msg09964.html) \u201cwould probably not seem like a big deal.\u201d\n\n-----\n\n**What is the block size debate all about anyways?**\n\nThe block size debate boils down to different sets of users who are trying to come to consensus on the best way to scale Bitcoin for growth and success. Scaling Bitcoin has actually been a topic of discussion since Bitcoin was first released in 2008; for example you can read how Satoshi Nakamoto was [asked about scaling here](https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography%40metzdowd.com/msg09964.html) and how he thought at the time it would be addressed. Fortunately Bitcoin has seen tremendous growth and by the year 2013, scaling Bitcoin had became a hot topic. For a run down on the history of scaling and how we got to where we are today, see the [Block size limit debate history lesson post](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/61mxuj/block_size_limit_debate_history_lesson/).\n\n-----\n\n**What is a hard fork?**\n\nA hard fork is when a block is broadcast under a new and different set of protocol rules which is accepted by nodes that have upgraded to support the new protocol. In this case, Bitcoin diverges from a single blockchain to two separate blockchains (a majority chain and a minority chain).\n\n-----\n\n**What is a soft fork?**\n\nA soft fork is when a block is broadcast under a new and different set of protocol rules, but the difference is that nodes don\u2019t realize the rules have changed, and continue to accept blocks created by the newer nodes. Some argue that [soft forks are bad](https://medium.com/@octskyward/on-consensus-and-forks-c6a050c792e7) because they trick old-unupdated nodes into believing transactions are valid, when they may not actually be valid. This can also be defined as coercion, as [explained by Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/03/14/forks_and_markets.html).\n\n-----\n\n**Doesn't it hurt decentralization if we increase the block size?**\n\nSome argue that by lifting the limit on transaction space, that the cost of validating transactions on individual nodes will increase to the point where people will not be able to run nodes individually, giving way to centralization. This is a false dilemma because at this time there is no proven metric to quantify decentralization; although it has been shown that the [current level of decentralization will remain](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5fyve1/fallacy_the_key_to_bitcoins_decentralization_is_a/) with or without a block size increase. It's a logical fallacy to believe that decentralization only exists when you have people all over the world running full nodes. The reality is that only people with the income to sustain running a full node (even at 1MB) will be doing it. So whether it's 1MB, 2MB, or 32MB, the costs of doing business is negligible for the people who can already do it. If the block size limit is removed, this will also allow for more users worldwide to use and transact introducing the likelihood of having more individual node operators. [Decentralization is not a metric, it's a tool or direction](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/693537120351293440). This is a good video describing the direction of [how decentralization should look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S1IqaSLrq8).\n\nAdditionally, the effects of increasing the block capacity beyond 1MB [has been studied](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/cornell-study-recommends-4mb-blocksize-bitcoin/) with results showing that up to 4MB is safe and will not hurt decentralization ([Cornell paper, PDF](http://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/CDE+16.pdf)). Other papers also show that no block size limit is safe ([Peter Rizun, PDF](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/resources/feemarket.pdf)). Lastly, through an informal survey among all top Bitcoin miners, many agreed that a block size increase [between 2-4MB is acceptable](http://archive.is/U3dqr).\n\n-----\n\n**What now?**\n\nBitcoin is a fluid ever changing system.

It's just a historical quirk, unfortunately.\n> \n> Back in 2015, when the blocksize debate got into full swing, /r/bitcoin was the go-to place for Bitcoin discussion. But the blocksize debate changed the landscape significantly. In 2015, most users (including on Reddit) favored an increase to the blocksize limit, but it was opposed by a majority of Core developers, as well as Theymos, the lead mod of /r/bitcoin and owner of bitcointalk.org. When Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn started the Bitcoin XT project to offer a hard fork to increase the blocksize limit, Theymos had a fit, and began to censor any comments or posts that advocated for a hard fork to increase blocksize. Theymos wrote:\n> \n> If 90% of /r/Bitcoin users find these policies to be intolerable, then I want these 90% of /r/Bitcoin users to leave.\n> \n> Many of us did, but not 90%. About 30% of users (judging by comment counts) left /r/bitcoin, and most of them ended up here on /r/btc before the beginning of 2016. As /r/bitcoin was censored (no promotion of hard forks) and /r/btc was not, an ideological rift formed between the two subreddits. Most proponents of big blocks ended up here, whereas most neutral people and proponents of small blocks stayed there. Over time, the echo chamber of /r/bitcoin had its effect, and the neutral people got converted into small block proponents.\n> \n> Data source\n> \n> It is the belief of most people in /r/btc that the Bitcoin project was hijacked with censorship. Many people here also believe that Bitcoin's hijacking was orchestrated by Blockstream -- a company that hired most of the full-time Bitcoin Core developers, and whose business model (side-chains like Liquid) depends on Bitcoin being congested and unusable except as a settlement layer.\n> \n> In 2016-2017, once it was clear that the big block proponents had become a minority, and that a consensus fork to increase the blocksize limit was unlikely to ever occur, most of us in /r/btc switched to supporting a minority hard fork. Our goal was to route around the corruption that we saw in Bitcoin's leadership. That project started as the Minimum Viable Fork project, and eventually became BCH.\n> \n> It is our belief that BCH is what Bitcoin always should have been.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/i207yk/btc_or_is_it_bch/g02cqzn/",

In an interview with CNBC, Yakovenko noted that one of the major distinctions between Solana and Bitcoin is the former's energy efficiency.\n\nYakovenko elaborated on this:\nAccording to Solana's energy report, a single Solana transaction consumes around the same amount of energy as two Google searches. Even among proof-of-stake networks, I believe it is one of the most efficient. \nYakovenko went on to say that most of the networks people would use in the future will be built on PoS consensus, in his opinion. In response to a question about Bitcoin's future in this setting, Yakovenko stated:\n\nNobody will utilize [Bitcoin] if it does not move to proof-of-stake at some point.\n\nI don't agree with him. I think Bitcoin would survive even without switching to a proof of stake system of operation. Bitcoin has in recent years come under heavy fire for it's environmental impact but that hasn't changed how much value is placed in the network. The proof-of-stake consensus has been shown be require way more energy consumption that the Proof-of- Work system Bitcoin currently operates.   \n\nOther major players in the crypto community seem to be adopting Proof-of-stake system as Ethereum  platform is set to change it's network operation to proof of stake. Platforms like Cardano  a public blockchain platform. It is open-source and decentralized , Quint an ecosystem that bridges the metaverse and the physical world by offering investors real life rewards. , Algorand  a blockchain cryptocurrency protocol with a consensus mechanism chosen for scalability, intending to solve the blockchain trilemma operate a proof-of-stake system",

With POS, your coin is backed by more of itself. Plus scaling in Ethereums case will still be adding to the block capacity, the only difference being it will have tons of chains intermingling and connected by the beacon chain. Frankly from an engineering standpoint it is a mess and disaster waiting to happen (as one of the lead devs recently noted). People fear POW because they swear the entry cost will become too high and the chain will centralize. Valid concern, but bad information behind it. Look at memory capacity in the last decade alone. I remember the first iPhone I got rocking a massive 16GB. Now I can order a 14TB drive for a couple hundred bucks. The fear is overplayed and does a disservice to the chains using it and the security of it alike.",

It's very doable doing this secretly from multiple accounts that nobody knows belong to one owner. \n\nIs getting all the coins becoming to expensive? Manipulate the price on all the various exchanges! Nobody will know, they are block boxes. \n\n\nControlling a proof of work system can be done exactly the same, just print fait and buy more asics. But the asics manufacturers will quickly realize there is a new buyer in town. Then build your new data centre to plug in all the asics. But the people in the towns where you build them will quickly realize somebody is building big data centre. Now trow your hash online. All the other miners will quickly notice somebody is trowing enormous amounts of hash online.\n\nAre you running out of asics to buy because they can't be produces fast enough and trowing more money at the problem does not help cause there is a shortage of a mineral? Well I guess you will have to wait. I guess you will have to buy up every time more of this mineral becomes available someewhere. Perhaps even send the CIA to a mine and completely take it over.\n\n\nYeah good luck doing all of that coverly.\n\nWith Proof of work you are always going to run in to psysical limitations eventually. With proof of stake EVERYTHING is virtual, nothing in the real world changes. \n\n\nThis is why proof of work will always be \n\n- more fair (a whizzkid can invent a miner that mines at 100x the hash and 1/100th the electricity)\n\n- more secure. (psysical limitation).\n\nTaking over a proof of stake system, if there are enough coins on the market can be done in no time.\n\nTaking over a proof of work system takes years. The asics need to be build, the data centre need to be build. And while this is happening you got to pray the other miners don't get more asics or build more datacentre.",

Despite a shift in public opinion toward bitcoin, Buffett remains unconvinced.\nI have no idea if it will rise or fall in the next year, five years, or ten years. But there's one thing I'm certain of: it doesn't generate anything,\" stated Buffett. \"It has a magical quality to it, and people have ascribed magical qualities to a variety of things.\"\n\nI for one think he is wrong, Bitcoin has made the way for a thriving blockchain ecosystem where in we can carryout different transactions using cryptocurrencies.\n Decentralized platforms such as, Decentraland  an online world that allows users to create their own avatars and purchase plots of virtual land, Champions a decentralized and collaborative online casino which allows developers to build Games around betting, PancakeSwap a decentralized  exchange allows users to buy and sell digital tokens without going through a third party, make use of cryptos as a form of lending, borrowing, buying and a whole lot of other forms of use transactions. \nThis gives it gives it intrinsic value and indicates to us the possibility of Bitcoin and altcoins being used for  everyday transaction.",

Essentially the idea is stocks have value because they are ownership in a company that makes a profit, but Bitcoin at best is 0 sum.\n\nPersonally I'm convinced by this line of reasoning. Bitcoin truly is valueless as a security, it only has any hope of utility as a true currency. It won't be a currency until we have a whole circular economy really priced in Bitcoin (not a floating Bitcoin price that's fixed in dollars).\n\nSo to me the only reason to invest in cryptocurrency is to bet that one of them will become the new world currency.

If the conspiracies can be believed, then someone had a very successful psy-op against bitcon which resulted in the split. Which set the real bitcoin (BCH) back by at least 5 years. Maybe more. Obviously we can't have that happen again. If we do, when does it end? If you keep allowing it, they'll just keep swatting it back down and setting it back 5 years every time it threatens them.\n\nBut a lot can be learned from the first time. We don't have to repeat the mistakes of the past. So have steps been taken to prevent/preempt another banker or glowboy invasion?

You can't count on the law, but if you get the opportunity to bludgeon them with it, you should. That's why they do their dirty deeds in a sneaky and underhanded way.\n\nIf they were on the up and up, they'd just have a judge serve a warrant and that would be that. If word got out about what they were up to, the court of public opinion would turn against them rapidly. Then not only would they fail in their goal, they may also have their own problems with the law. It's happened many times. They don't want to take that risk, however small it may be. So they just remain in the shadows. It seems to work very well for them.\n\nFor reference see the Calyx OS guy. The FBI didn't like the fact that he created calyx, because it cut their backdoor access to android phones. They did the glowboy thing and tried to intimidate him. He told them to eat it, I'll see you in court. The judge sided with him. The FBI got to pound sand, and Calyx remains to this day. Anyone can go get it and use it.

As if the question was actually hard at the time rather than \"hey let's limit the chain to the speed of a fax machine forever, and tell everybody loudly that's what we're doing, and that we believe this is an intelligent and unquestionably optimal thing to do, and our justification for this is we want to turn the chain into a layer for settlement and push all other transactions through chokepoints on centralised hubs, forget all that 'decentralised currency' stuff, that was just a joke, nothing to see here, please move along\".\n\nThis narrative will not be improved by \"forget all that stuff we said five years ago, turns out we were wrong all along and the other guys were right, we're going to just copy what they do now, but please don't take this as any endorsement of their project or decisions or anything, they're still totally wrong and bad because reasons we haven't yet had time to properly fabricate. Definitely don't go to their chain instead whatever you do. \"\n\nFrankly, it could've been so much harder and has been so many times, because certain splits between certain chains at certain times have actually been close run things you could easily argue for either side of the split on. But for the BTC split there was no such dilemma. Anybody who had attempted to do even the slightest math on the question would immediately have realised how utterly ridiculous the proposed block limit was, and given how hard it was pushed, and how many people forced it through as a transparent sabotage and nothing more, it has utterly invalidated itself for all future purposes other than as a containment chain for saboteurs and their clueless marks.",

Essentially giving up?\n\nSee above responses.\n\n> Is BitcoinCash impossible to market properly due to branding alone?\n\nYes. We've been shit upon since 2017, laughed at, ignored by news outlets, hated by the maxis, and our progress has been automatically hated because \"it's in bcash and they're wasting time\".\n\n>The numerous flipstarters focusing on \u2018marketing\u2019 feel like cashgrabs without substance too.\n\nOnly Marc Falzon's marketing flipstarter went through, you know.

We can all agree that asking for Bitcoin to develop Bitcoin is a worthy fundraiser.\n\nThe issue is \"what about *promoting* Bitcoin (BCH)?\" Because that's how you end up with \"Bitcoincash animal rescue.\" The scammers simply have to say that they'll promote BCH as part of their rescue operation and the community falls right for it. BCH doesn't really have anything whatsoever to do with animal rescue.  There's no real crypto tie in at all. It's just an excuse to ask for money.\n\nWe can all agree that animal rescue of any sort is a worthwhile cause. I myself have rescued several. It's important to me. But unless someone has actually figured out some real tie-in to Bitcoin, it's begging.\n\n>Would be great to have a sticky post here or website where genuine projects are listed and can be validated by the community.\n\nWho will do the validation?

But with so much optimization work going on in this area we already have shown that using modest hardware we can maintain sync even at very high throughput. So now that we've solved so many scaling problems in propagation and validation I guess it's fair to start to look at storage again.",

About two weeks ago, my account got \"un-kyc\" and needed to KYC again.\n\nI opened a ticket with them asking why. \n\nThe first reply I got is the following.\n\n>Greetings from CoinPayments. Hope you are having a great day.  \n>  \n>\u200bI am reaching out about the query regarding your KYC. I would like to inform you, your uploaded proof of address was rejected due to unacceptable date of issue. The uploaded proof of identity was rejected as your identity document has expired and can't be used for verification.  \n>  \n>\u200bPlease provide valid documents. For proof of address, it could be either a utility bill, landline internet/phone bill, bank/credit card statement, tax invoice, or other government-issued residential statements/certificate which is **no more than 3 months old**, **contain your full name**\u00a0and your\u00a0**full address**, and not be the same as the documents uploaded for your ID.  \n>  \n>\u200bFor the Proof of Identity, you can provide us with your passport, driving license, or national ID card with full details (full name, date of birth, ID photo, and expiry date ) on them. The document has to be authentic and valid (min one month before its expiry date).  \n>  \n>\u200bYou can use your ID document as proof of address if it contains your home address information and was issued within the last 3 months. But in this case, you will need to provide another ID document as your proof of identity. You can't use the same document to prove both your address and your identity.  \n>  \n>Please note that we don't accept screenshots, mobile phone bills, medical bills, purchase receipts, or insurance statements.\u00a0  \n>  \n>\u200bThe document must be an original or PDF document. You cannot upload screenshots or modified images. \n\n\u200bNow, of course the uploaded proof of identify is expired. Because I uploaded them years ago. \n\nSo I asked them if they where the policy that they require continuous KYC.\n\n>Hi there,  \n>  \n>Thanks for writing in.  \n>  \n>\u200bSorry for the delayed response.  \n>  \n>This is in reference to your previous response. I understand your KYC was approved earlier. I see that your identity document has expired, due to this the system has rejected the KYC.  \n>  \n>\u200bI apologize for the inconvenience caused.  \n>  \n>\u200bI request you to upload documents with a valid date of issue. For proof of address, it could be either a utility bill, landline internet/phone bill, bank/credit card statement, tax invoice, or other government-issued residential statements/certificate which is **no more than 3 months old**, **contain your full name**\u00a0and your\u00a0**full address**, and not be the same as the documents uploaded for your ID.  \n>  \n>\u200bFor the Proof of Identity, you can provide us with your passport, driving license, or national ID card with full details (full name, date of birth, ID photo, and expiry date ) on them. The document has to be authentic and valid (min one month before its expiry date).  \n>  \n>\u200bAppreciate your understanding.\n\nOf course, they dodged the question about policy.\n\nThe next reply gets more ridiculous.\n\n>Hi there,  \n>  \n>\u200bThanks for writing in.  \n>  \n>Sorry for the delayed response.  \n>  \n>This is in reference to your previous response. After reviewing your logs, I see that a new account with User ID: XXXXX was created by you. For the KYC verification of this account, the same documents were uploaded. Due to this, our system detected both the accounts and since the documents were expired both the KYC verifications were rejected.  \n>  \n>Could you please confirm the reason for creating another account?  \n>  \n>\u200bAwaiting your response.\n\nWait... there is no \"new account\" in question here. **The other account I opened was for another business and KYC'ed years ago as well.**\n\n>Thank you for your message.  \n>  \n>\u200bI double-checked all of the details on both IDs and found that the same documents (driver's license) were uploaded for both accounts, and the selfies appear to be identical in both. I also want to let you know that you have a duplicate account with the following USER ID and email address:  \n>  \n>USER ID: XXXXX\u00a0  \n>  \n>Email address: abc@abc.com  \n>  \n>\u200bI've also attached the driver's license used for verification purposes of both the accounts, please find the document attached to this email.  \n>  \n>**Therefore, I kindly request you to state the reason for creating another account.**  \n>  \n>Awaiting your response.\n\nOf course, both IDs and the selfie is the same. I'm the same person. \n\n>So now, they go back to their garbage response.  \n>  \n>Thank you for your message.  \n>  \n>\u200bI'm sorry to notify you that your proof of address was denied owing to unsatisfactory issue date. Your identity proof has expired and cannot be used for verification, hence your uploaded evidence of identity was denied.  \n>  \n>\u200bTherefore, I request you kindly reapply for KYC /provide us with a valid Proof of address document that was issued within the last 3 months.\u00a0  \n>  \n>\u200bAppreciate your patience and understanding in this regard.\n\nMore bullshit...\n\n>Thank you for your response and sorry for the delayed response.  \n>  \n>\u200b\u200bI would like to reiterate that in order to verify your KYC submission, we would require a valid Proof of address issued within the last 3 months.  \n>  \n>\u200bAwaiting your response.\n\nI replied, my account was verified already.\n\n>Thank you for your message.  \n>  \n>\u200bAs mentioned earlier, the document provided as your Proof of address earlier has expired. Hence, we are requesting you provide us with a Valid Proof of address issued within the last 3 months.  \n>  \n>\u200bOnce we receive the requested document in PDF format, I will be able to help you further.\n\nSo I decided to ask them when I submitted the proof.\n\n>Thank you for writing back.  \n>  \n>\u200bAppologies for the inconvieniece.  \n>  \n>\u200bAfter reviewing our system, I discovered that you uploaded Proof of Address (POA) documents while processing KYC that was more than 3 months old. As a result, I'd like to recommend that you re-upload or send us directly here the most recent POA document that is less than 3 months old, as this will allow us to verify your KYC.  \n>  \n>\u200b\u200bAwaiting your response.\n\nI asked them when my document was uploaded.\n\n>Thank you for writing back,  \n>  \n>\u200bUpon checking our records, I can see that you uploaded the documents on xxxx. However, as of (2 weeks ago), your license has expired as a result you are required to re-verify your KYC. As a result, I'd request you to upload or send us here valid documents as mentioned below:  \n>  \n>\u200bProof of Identity (POI): Please provide us with your passport, driving license, or national ID card with full details (full name, date of birth, ID photo, and expiry date ) on them? The document has to be authentic and valid (**min one month before its expiry date**).  \n  \n>  \n>Proof of Address (POA): Please provide valid proof of address. It could be either a utility bill, landline internet/phone bill, bank/credit card statement, tax invoice, or other government-issued residential statements/certificate which is no more than **3 months old**, contain your full name and your full address, and not be the same as the documents uploaded for your ID.  \n>  \n>\u200bAwaiting your response.\n\nAs I ask them again. Where is the policy in the terms of service that I need to continuously KYC myself.\n\n>Thank you for writing back.  \n>  \n>Please be informed that due to security concerns we require the most recent document that is not expired. Because our system identified that your driving license expired on 14/04/2022, we recommend that you upload new documents in accordance with the requirements so that we can re-verify your account and complete your KYC.  \n>  \n>\u200bProof of Identity (POI): Please provide us with your passport, driving license, or national ID card with full details (full name, date of birth, ID photo, and expiry date ) on them? The document has to be authentic and valid (**min one month before its expiry date**).  \n  \n>  \n>Proof of Address (POA): Please provide valid proof of address.

Therefore I will need KYC myself again. They cannot provide any terms of service where an already KYC account need to reverify due to an expired proof of identity.** \n\nFinally, here is their \"User Agreement\" regarding verification.\n\n>Identity Verification.

Panama has no currency per its constitution, but has officially been on the U.S. dollar for more than a century.\n\n>!Prior to the bill, said Silva, it was illegal for digital asset companies to set up shop in Panama, but that would change once the legislation becomes law.\n\n>!Additionally, he said, the law treats crypto assets as foreign-source income, which in accordance with Panama's territorial taxation system, means no taxes on capital gains.",

                    "response": "\"But but but lightning.\"\n\nIt's pretty clear that even the most optimistic outlook for lightning still leaves it yet incapable of meeting visa-level demand.\n\nAssuming enough liquidity to meet 1600 TPS, that liquidity still needs to be added to the network with an on chain transaction.  At 4 TPS.  We'd better hope then that every user is making (1600/4) 400 transactions on lightning for every opening/closing transaction or layer 1 cannot keep up. Personally I don't believe that's likely.  The implication is that you prefund every 800 transactions you make (and let's not even talk about the prefund part of that requiring an anti-credit-card like behaviour).  Do any of us do that?  800 expenditure transactions for every income transaction?  How many pages is your bank statement every month?\n\nYou can pick many of the practicalities of lightning and start pulling at the thread and it unravels like this.  BCH has a simple, understandable, and workable map to get to visa-level.  Its test network has already demonstrated it's capable of that level.\n\nLightning is a horrible joke.  Adding unnecessary complexity to fail to achieve the very thing that justifies it's existence.\n\nHowever, the only trajectory I can see for mass crypto acceptance now includes BTC.  BTC is the gateway drug. People will learn crypto through BTC, then will be less afraid of other crypto. They will go looking for better features when BTC and lightning let them down.  BCH will be waiting for them provided we just hold on enough.  So: don't worry too much about beating BTC, this is going to bea war of attrition and all BCH has to do is live long enough.",

The traditional stock markets suck, one of the reasons is that you can't *access* a market, but you need a middleman (more likely multiple middlemen) to access. Rent seeking and whatnot. \n\nThere's also a very stupid mechanic in US markets, and it's that **trade doesn't mean settlment**. Id est, the moment you *pay* for a share is not the moment you *receive* it. Instead you will get it sometime between now and two days for now (that's the official version). \n\nThe reasoning for this is for \"the sake of liquidity\" lol. This creates artificial supply, and so, it doesn't follow the law of supply and demand anymore. Anything that doesn't follow the supply and demand isn't really a \"market\", but I'm rambling. \n\nAnyway, \"trade\" isn't \"settlement\", and this gives power to your broker to profit from you. Now, remember when BTC maxis want to transform BTC into a \"settlement layer\"? I 'member. Said \"settlement layer\" would only be accessible to the biggest and central banks. All the rest of us won't be able to transact onchain directly, and will have to make do with non-settlement layers. \n\nMaxis are recreating traditional banking on BTC. They are not Bitcoin maximalists, they are banking maximalists.",

Here we still have UX work to do but the pieces are in place.\n\nAgain the point isn't to do a marketing stunt before the tech is ready, but to drive an engineering milestone for when it is ready.

If you still have the code and remember it I'd love to see if we could get it up and running still. What do you think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, can I ask what happened with the offline functionality for the Paytaca wallet? To me that was the super interesting part and the real selling point. Can you give a short overview of what the problem was that you guys couldn't get past?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks so much, I'll be sure to pledge some BCH to the project and best of luck, we are lucky to have you guys working in BCH even though I know right now is a bit of hard times :(",

Personally I don't see it as a worthwhile change if what one gets for it is:\n\n1.  < 3s finality (imo 0-conf is already a better performer, so essentially this doesn't add much)\n\n2. anti-forking resistance (because of the POS characteristics). I also think this is something unnecessary and hyped up as a \"feature\" by ABC whereas in reality if someone wants to fork a ledger, they _ALWAYS_ can, by just changing the consensus mechanism in a significant way.\n\n3. Protection against malicious re-org: in practice this is resolved by gaining enough SHA256 hashpower. Turning the coin into POS as a protection seems to defeat the purpose of Bitcoin to me, but for those who are interested in that experiment, I guess it exists in another variant now.",

So it's probably better to spin it off as it's own protocol (as has been done) and let the market decide if Avalanche is a good protocol or not.",

One of the biggest advantages of crypto tokens with centralized developers (BTC) and a small number of large \"whale\" holders (ETH) is that they have the incentive to promote their investment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA user of a truly decentralized cryptocurrency has a low incentive to fund development or advertise to others because they will benefit relatively little for the cost.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne solution to this is a community funded advertising platform where any money donated to an address will be tracked and used directly on advertising for Bitcoin Cash. I hope that someday a process like this could be fully automated wherein users vote for the advertisements to be shown based on how much they've donated to do to the address. Anybody would be able to submit an ad and anyone else can donate to have that ad published.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezweo6fetbw81.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=6547492727b0160538b263263288eecf3b09e583\n\nRight now there is no perfect platform to do this but the website, a - A d s . c o m is set up so that once the ads are submitted it generates a deposit address which is automatically spent to fund the ads. I think given time and effort something like this would be a great option for a Bitcoin cash decentralized organization but for now would be fully dependent on a third party advertising platform.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What I'm starting with:\n\nI am funding the campaign for just around $10 a day for now and will keep it up as long as I can. Here are the current ads running: [https://rawcdn.githack.com/KyleBenzle/ItsBitcoinBCH/a22b0e1fb0e5612c6ebe2f8bb38952e459f45ad5/Current\\_Ads.html](https://rawcdn.githack.com/KyleBenzle/ItsBitcoinBCH/a22b0e1fb0e5612c6ebe2f8bb38952e459f45ad5/Current_Ads.html)\n\nAnd here is what the campaign looks like so far:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ni27nurytbw81.png?width=1178&format=png&auto=webp&s=7085a3f9c191b88355f7fb43590e98138c588777\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1e592i71ubw81.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c0aff03a02401e0068b8b0ff82e3ca72bf71aab\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8hu45k42ubw81.png?width=1204&format=png&auto=webp&s=19e5e36d713491bc506b4d1b4564da71ecebe9c2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yhsleol2ubw81.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=185291dd534a7477224ec9c4ccd6fc4a9ec12acc\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qt9l3rysdcw81.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=24b66a9f4b3adec3753058b3e511219462f740a1\n\n# Questions and things still needed:\n\n1. Could really use help designing better ads. At some point I'll need to hire a designer but for now Im just using open source promo material. Better images and specifically for sizes:\n\n320x50\n\n320x100\n\n468x60\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Other sites to advertise on?\n\n3) Other sites to advertise for?

That's not revolutionary at all.\n\nWe've had the ability to use a intermediary to zap funds in the form of database entries or IOUs from person to person for at least 25 years now, 50 depending on when you want to start counting.  Zapping abstracted money isn't revolutionary either.\n \nTHE thing that makes Bitcoin revolutionary is the ability to **zap the gold in base money form from person to person with no need of an intermediary.** Magic, *teleportable* gold.  The moment you lock it in a bank or ask someone else to transfer it for you, you completely bork the magic.\n\nThat's why CASH is still the killer app.",

Consider for a second that the current banking industry is unable to provide a reasonable micropayment solution that does not involve depositing a reasonable sum and only allowing a withdraw after a reasonable sum has been accumulated. \n\n>Besides, 10 minutes is too long to verify that payment is good.  It needs to be as fast as swiping a credit card is today.\n\n>Thus we need bit-banks that allow instant transfers among members and peer banks.   Anyone can open a bit-bank but the system would, by necessity operate on some level of trust.  Transfers in and out of the banks and peer-to-peer would still be possible but will be more costly.   Thus, a bit bank could make money by enabling transfers cheaper and faster than the swarm with the added risk of trusting the bank.  A bank has to maintain trust to make money.\n\n~~ Daniel Larimer July 28, 2010\n\n>The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.\n\n\n>See the snack machine thread, I outline how a payment processor could verify payments well enough, actually really well (much lower fraud rate than credit cards), in something like 10 seconds or less.  **If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.**\n\n~~ Satoshi Nakamoto July 29, 2010\n\nSource: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6269#msg6269",

            "selftext": "Retirement giant Fidelity says it has launched a way for US workers to put some of their 401(k) directly in Bitcoin.\n\nAs cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects like DAODAO and Nature Vault gain traction in the mainstream, more US workers may soon be allowed to invest some of their 401(k) retirement funds in Bitcoin. \n\nFidelity Investments announced on Tuesday that employees will be able to invest up to 20% of their 401(k) savings and contributions directly in Bitcoin, all from the account's primary menu of investment options. Fidelity claims to be the first in the market to accept such investments without going through a separate brokerage window, and it has already signed up one company who will implement the service later this year.\n\nGiven the widespread worries about the riskiness of cryptocurrencies, Fidelity's offering may be one of only a few for a long. The US authorities urged the retirement industry last month to take \"great caution\" when undertaking something like this, citing fears that inexperienced investors may not understand how volatile cryptocurrency can be, among other things.\n\nIn the previous year, Bitcoin saw five days in which it fell by at least 10%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has only experienced two such declines in the last 50 years. Aside from its volatility, there's still a lot of debate about how much a Bitcoin is worth, whether it's even worth anything at all. \n\nSome investors may believe in all of Bitcoin's benefits, but they still prefer not to have to create a new account to buy it, learn how to store it, or deal with taxes on gains achieved in the years leading up to retirement. Or, as Dave Gray, Fidelity Investments' head of workplace retirement solutions and platforms, put it, they might come around to that belief soon, and Fidelity wanted to be prepared.\n\nCryptocurrencies, according to proponents, can improve returns in a well-diversified portfolio while reducing risk. That's because cryptocurrencies haven't always moved in lockstep with equities and other investments, despite the fact that they have done so in recent months on concerns about increasing interest rates.",

Because of current tax loopholes for crypto, this is like a double subsidy.\n\n It's pragmatic to diversify this way but it isn't ethical when folks like me refuse to invest because of our personal values.\n\nThis is putting aside whatever shitty companies I support via mutual fund investment. I do not have a solution for evil businesses and the stock market. I know folks here feel crypto could solve that, but I think it's just trading government corruption for oligarchy.\n\nI would feel the similarly about buying BCH with 401k money. Although, the tech would inherently be less wasteful with low fees. For BTC, I don't wanna see how transaction costs affect legacy brokerage fees. \ud83d\ude35",

After hearing both sides of the argument, I have to side with Satoshi's original vision. Which in this timeline, means bitcoin cash. I do have a few questions though:\n\n1. How powerful did the computers need to be in order for the smaller block-size guys to be happy? They wanted everyone and their dog to be able to run a node, but they couldn't because you couldn't do it on dial up and a potato PC. If you wanted larger blocks anyway. So what kind of computer did you have to have for larger block sizes? \n2. What does the road forward look like for bitcoin cash? I think it's safe to say that after the split, we got reset back to 2009 or 2010. Bch had to start the long road forward to mass adoption just like bitcoin did. It will probably be a bit longer now. And love him or hate him, I think Richard Heart is right about something - They really should have cut the mount Gox trustee out of the aidrop for BCH. And a few others. Because all they'll ever do is dump on you. But one day they'll be out of money to dump at least. \n3. Is there any video detailing how to get a merchant set up to take bitcoin cash as a payment? \n\nThank you!",

Yes, the censorship and slander was devastating. Nevertheless BCH is doing fine. It fell out of the focus of the crypto crowd but otherwise adoption is rising. http://map.bitcoin.com. The BCH community is actually a community that works towards adoption.\nRegarding development, there is a ton going on on SmartBCH a EVM compatible L2 and there are projects to scale beyond 32MB. 256MB are already running on scalenet.

The exchange filed a motion in a Texas court to be exempted from the $8 million lawsuit, claiming that it isn't subject to the Texas court's jurisdiction. \n\nDivya Gadasalli filed a federal lawsuit, alleging that Binance failed to do its job in stopping the scammers. She claims she lost digital assets she bought on Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) to scammers, and she feels Binance, Poloniex (which is now controlled by TRON founder Justin Sun), and American banks TD Bank and Abacus Federal Savings Bank should be held responsible. She is demanding $8 million from the defendants.\n\nAccording to Law360, Binance, the largest cryptocurrency platform and the home to blockchain projects like DAODAO and Faith Tribe has fought back. The plaintiff's complaints were based on \"paper-thin statements,\" according to the conversation, and she had failed to establish a claim. \n\nBinance further claimed that because it does not operating in the United States, it is outside of the Texas court's jurisdiction. It claimed that because it was a foreign entity, it was immune from local Texan civil laws. \n\nBinance Global, the company behind the tumultuous exchange, does not operate in the United States. However, it continues to provide services to Americans through its subsidiary, Binance.US, which has been embroiled in controversy over issues ranging from former Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks' strange resignation to another former CEO's disappearance for months now after leaving her position at the exchange.\n\nScammers pretend to establish an emotional connection with their victims before enticing them to deliver digital assets or invest in a shady company. Since the pandemic began, romantic frauds have increased by 40%, according to Action Fraud in the United Kingdom. \n\n\"People feel lonely as a result of the pandemic, and cryptocurrency is really popular right now.\" According to Jan Lee, a researcher at the online fraud-prevention business Sift, \"the combination of the two has truly made this a successful hoax.\"",

                    "response": "Bitcoin Cash is the highly improved version of BTC. Anyone can verify for themselves. Just send $1 worth of BTC and $1 worth of Bitcoin Cash from your own wallet A (not an exchange) to your own wallet B (not an exchange) and see for yourself the difference. But Bitcoin Cash is more than just fast cheap and reliable, it has many unique advantages over the old tech BTC (forever stuck on 1mb). Here are the improvements from Bitcoin Cash.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Better Security** \u2013 BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. This RBF security vulnerability exists only in BTC and not Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash is more secure as a payment method.\n\nHere is an example of hackers stolen $150000 worth of BTC using the RBF security vulnerability. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/14/double-spenders-scam-150000-bitcoin/\n\nIt is super easy to double spend on Bitcoin using the RBF vulnerability. Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/video-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-double-spend-btc-using-rbf/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Rapidly Growing Transactions Volume** - Bitcoin Cash has more transactions than BTC+Lightning Network combined recently. On some days, Bitcoin Cash has more than double the transactions volume of BTC. Bitcoin Cash is growing rapidly while BTC is on the decline.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Defi Smart Contracts** - Bitcoin Cash has defi smart contracts functionalities (eg. AnyHedge, Detoken, SmartBCH). SmartBCH allows Ethereum smart contracts to be deployed as a sidechain to the Bitcoin Cash network. This means as an Ethereum developer, you no longer has any friction jumping over to join the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. All of them can come over to the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem to enjoy the low transaction fees of Bitcoin Cash.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Low Fees** \u2013 One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Derivatives, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Improved Scalability** \u2013 BTC is limited to 1MB blocksize and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Supply Scarcity** \u2013 During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Improved Confirmation Times** \u2013 Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Higher Merchants Adoption** - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it.

They also get harassed and attacked by online paid trolls. All these started back in 2015 even before Bitcoin Cash existed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**\"Digital Gold\" Or \"Store Of Value\" Propaganda** - BTC is good with propaganda but this is simple economics. Something cannot be a store of value without it first be a means of exchange. Bitcoin Cash is both a store of value AND means of exchange thanks to its low fees. Bitcoin is not feasible as a means of exchange due to its high fees of around $10 (or more) per transaction.\n\n> Store of Value: To act as a store of value, money must be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved. It must be predictably usable as a medium of exchange when it is retrieved. Additionally, the value of money must remain stable over time.\n\n> Source: https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-economics/chapter/introducing-money/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Tokens** - Today, anyone can issue their own loyalty tokens or digital money on Bitcoin Cash from as low as 1 cent. It's incredibly easy and anyone can do it at https://mint.bitcoin.com/. And anyone can then buy/sell/trade their newly created tokens on https://1BCH.com/ exchange which is fully focused on Bitcoin Cash and BCH tokens.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Increased Privacy** - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Continuous Innovations** - For example, Cash Accounts allow people to send BCH to an easy to remember non-custodial alias such as MobTwo#12345. You may register your Cash Account at https://www.cashaccount.info/\n\nTogether with Reusable Payment Addresses (RPA), Cash Accounts will allow people to send BCH to your easy to remember alias with increased privacy. You can read more about RPA at https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/o1z8a1/help_me_test_the_prototype_of_electron_cash_rpa/\n\nMany more innovations on BCH not covered in this comment to avoid turning this into an encyclopedia.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 1 trillion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 1 trillion will give you around 128x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities. As an investor, it make sense to know the difference between price and value. Bitcoin Cash has a high value low price while BTC has low value high price.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt the moment, the old BTC has first mover advantage (eg. Friendster or MySpace or Kodak or Nokia) but that can only last them to a point. Eventually, I believe that Bitcoin Cash will overtake BTC's marketcap. Bitcoin Cash is the second opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a low price if you missed that opportunity back in 2013.",

I'll obviously have to do more research in how this works but I'll take your word for now. I can see this being a much more viable option for merchants vs. BTC I guess.

It was super helpful and it took me a while to go through all the links and points. I'm not really shocked at the propaganda against BCH, given that usually happens with most crypto anyway, I guess what I don't like is that its coming from another crypto group (come on guys we are all fighting the traditional financial system, we need to stick together!).\n\nI guess my only question for you would be this. There are clear advantages between BCH vs BTC based on what you have shared and it seems like BCH has a much larger adoption vs. BTC + lightning. In your opinion, why do you think the overall \"investment\" adoption hasn't caught up yet i.e. in terms of market cap, institutional adoption etc. Propaganda? First mover advantage? I'm curious.\n\nBut thanks either way!",

That's because in theory blocks can be replaced. It's theoretically possible, though entirely improbable, that someone has been mining a blockchain in secret for a decade, and at any moment will release their \"longer chain\" and rewrite everyone's transactions.\n\nMore likely, reorgs at the chain tip (the most recent block or so) do happen, but rarely. Any time a block is replaced, then the transactions in that block might also be replaced.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that **transactions are not final even when they've been mined into a block.** They're actually never *truly* final, just less and less likely to be replaceable.\n\nSo there is no magic moment when a blockchain transaction reaches \"true finality.\" Transactions only ever achieve \"good enough\" finality.\n\nFor some applications like exchanges, six or more confirmations may be required. For other applications, just one confirmation may be required. And for some applications, a confirmation may not be required at all.\n\n___\n\nLet's compare an unconfirmed BCH transaction to a credit card transaction.\n\nWhen you use the card you get a notification in seconds that the payment has been recorded. But the payment isn't *settled* or *final* for several weeks to a couple of months. The card could be fraudulent, the buyer could reverse the transaction, etc.  Yet somehow most every business on earth runs on this system.\n\nCompare to BCH. Here you also get a notification in seconds that the payment has been received. Like a credit card payment, there exists a small (smaller) chance of reversal. But now the time to finality is measured in minutes or at most a few hours.",

But that's ignoring the possibility of reorgs which might attempt to orphan the transaction (highly unlikely). On BTC the transaction is only able to, effectively, reach payment finality, once the transaction has been included in a block (same caveat as above re: reorgs); And as I previously mentioned in my other comment, could be more than a month.",

Seems pretty stupid. \n\nIf you break the basic economic model of Bitcoin by capping blocksize, you then need to start adding fixes for the unnecessary problem you have created.  RBF is one of those, so they can say payments don't get forever stuck and you can unstick them if necessary (when really, nothing should ever get stuck... by raising the blocksize).\n\n> Will BCH's fees always remain low? If they ever become high, what can be done to get them low again? \n\nYes.  They won't get high, because Bitcoin is designed to scale, and the BCH community will raise the blocksize as user adoption increases.\n\n> \"Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.\" ... What are these upgrades and when will they be implemented? \n\nMostly larger blocksizes, but also improvements to node software parallelisation and ongoing improvements to hardware tech e.g. increasing bandwidth, reduced storage costs etc.  These things are being worked on continuously by the node developers, e.g. https://read.cash/@TomZ/scaling-bitcoin-cash-68bffc6a\n\n> \"Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion.\" ...

I guess one could call themselves this, but, IMO, most of the coins/tokens seem to have create problems that the purport to fix. When in, IMO, what they really are doing is creating a coin/token to address a problem that never really existed or can be solved by expanding the cababilities of the base token, specifically BCH. I do not mention BTC because, as /u/opcode_network mentions (I also agree with everything he's said in [his comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/udjpq1/why_do_you_think_bch_is_superior_btc_holder/i6hbrag/)), the transaction limitation of BTC hinders/destroys BTC flexibility.\n\n> we gonna build lightning.\n\n<SMH> \n\nThe thing that the developers of the thing admitted would not be a scaling solution unless the base coin/token increased the block size. \n\nI once waited more than a month for one of my BTC transactions to complete. Luckily it was only a consolidation transaction and I had no need of those funds during that time. There was room in the next two blocks when I made my transaction, but during the next minutes the network became inundated with transactions and stayed that way for more than a month. Again, luckily, I did not need those funds but if I did need those funds  I would then have to fight everyone else to increase my fee just to gain access to my funds; that goes completely against what I, and many others, believed was one of the purposes of Bitcoin.\n\nI also support BCH due to upward mobility potential.",

Clearly, the whole world cannot onboard to BTC, unless custodial solutions are added.  This was the whole premise of it, to recreate the banking system by forcing people into using large liquidity hubs via custodial solutions (what is usually called, in fiat terms, \"a bank\").\n\nThat's a good starting point for thinking about this issue.\n\nNothing wrong with Lightning network itself, and BCH may one day copy all the open source code and have it too for sub microsend mass payments or use cases where it makes sense, but if it's the only option and on chain payments don't work, then by default it captures all of the users into custodians.\n\nThis documentary has a whole section about Lightning network towards the end, but it's important to see the lead up which explains who funds the creation of lightning network as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eafzIW52Rgc",

The reason why p2p cash is much more important than digital gold or a settlement layer is this: financial freedom is only gained if you can use your coin.

LN has a problem, it never was intended as a scaling solution and routing with the need for liquidity is complicated an breaks it. \n\nThen why didn't BCH win the scaling war?

Let's try two payment models.\n\nIn the first, Alice pays Bob directly, using a hard asset - in this case, a chunk of gold. Alice owns and controls her gold completely. At the moment of transaction, she hands the gold to Bob, who then immediately owns and controls it completely.\n\nAlice and Bob are sovereign. If we could use gold like money, we'd have been doing it this way for centuries, because it's empowering. The problem is gold doesn't work well like that. It's heavy, bulky, and very hard to divide up on the spot. \n\nEnter the intermediary. The intermediary \"solves\" the problem of gold being difficult and expensive to transact with. You deposit the gold with the intermediary, and then you use the gold as collateral to transact against. So when Alice wants to pay Bob, she asks her intermediary Charlie to debit her account and credit Bob's account.\n\nThis solved the problem of gold being difficult to transact -- because we aren't transacting in gold. We're transacting in IOUs. And when we want to transact, we need permission from Charlie.\n\nBut in doing so, **we lost our sovereignty.** Also, Charlie can operate fractionally, and debase the currency.\n\nThe lesson here is that \"money\" that you cannot use in its base form is categorically inferior to money which you can transact in its base form.\n\n**When you have to turn the base layer money into an abstraction, then you lose the very property that gave the money value to begin with.**",

Let me explain: \n\n- True peer to peer transactions that requires NO middlemen. That means no L2s (e.g. Lightning), no custodial \"solutions\". Pure cheap peer to peer cash transactions that cannot censored or seized. On BTC peer to peer is still possible, but it is expensive (fees) since thr capacity is capped. BCH does not have that problem and it has the tech to scale. \n\n- Even L2s work better on BCH. The most popular L2 on BCH is SmartBCH, which is a Ethereum compatible smart contract sidechain. SmartBCH is a hybrid between BCH miner validated and POS style coin day based voting. \n\n- BCH has many places where it can be used as real money to pay for things (Carribian Islands such as St.Kitts&Nevis, St\nBaarths, St. Maarten, NQ Townsville Australia, Slovenia etc ) and it works way better than the El Salvador solutions. \n\nIn summary - I can pay with it, I can transfer funds fast and reliable, I can DeFi with it and stake, do liquidity staking etc. and earn passive income as well. Plus it has an awesome stablecoin called FlexUSD that automatically earns yield just by holding it. So for me BCH is a full eco-system that just works and is cheap to use and hence not forced to use custodians.",

Satoshi owns the same amount of BCH as they do BTC.\n\nAnd yet you can't talk about BCH in r\\Bitcoin without being banned and labeled a shitcoin scammer but in the same breath they will say Lightning is ok even though it's not PoW and it's not using the Blockchain.\n\nIn a normal world this is called propaganda and hypocrisy. \n\n\"The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide. Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost. It never really hits a scale ceiling. If you're interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size.  By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10. Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions.\n\nI don't anticipate that fees will be needed anytime soon, but if it becomes too burdensome to run a node, it is possible to run a node that only processes transactions that include a transaction fee. The owner of the node would decide the minimum fee they'll accept. Right now, such a node would get nothing, because nobody includes a fee, but if enough nodes did that, then users would get faster acceptance if they include a fee, or slower if they don't. The fee the market would settle on should be minimal. If a node requires a higher fee, that node would be passing up all transactions with lower fees. It could do more volume and probably make more money by processing as many paying transactions as it can. The transition is not controlled by some human in charge of the system though, just individuals reacting on their own to market forces.\n\nEventually, most nodes may be run by specialists with multiple GPU cards. For now, it's nice that anyone with a PC can play without worrying about what video card they have, and hopefully it'll stay that way for a while. More computers are shipping with fairly decent GPUs these days, so maybe later we'll transition to that.\"\n\n~ Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nSatoshi taking about increasing the blocksize: \n\n\"It can be phased in, like:\n\nif (blocknumber > 115000)\n    maxblocksize = largerlimit\n\nIt can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.  When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.\n\n~ Satoshi Nakamoto, on bitcointalk.org, October 04, 2010, 07:48:40 PM\n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366",

And although in Canada you have universal need-based healthcare, a lot of places in the world don't have that luxury. Just 200 km south, there is a country where working people, with insurance, routinely die because they were afraid to see a doctor, until it was too late.\n\nAnd in Africa, you know, sometimes someone has to get on a plane when they have a potentially terminal illness, or the airline won't let them on a plane at all when they are too sick. Then their options are to travel overland through multiple countries to a better hospital or to die slowly over the course of months for something that could have been easily treated elsewhere. \n\nSometimes you have to pay money to bad people because they say so, or they'll ruin your life. Sometimes, a situation develops in a country where if you don't get on a plane in time, there aren't going to be ANY planes flying out\u2014period.\n\nBasically, your personal life experience has probably illustrated to you a number of situations where someone has to pay money to live, or didn't pay money and therefore died. \n\nSo my pitch, is that you can buy a plane ticket with Bitcoin Cash when your life depends on it, or the life of someone you love. It's going to work 99.999% of the time.\n\nIf you need to send for someone else, they'll get it. Or you'll be able to get them something, even if a crypto bearer instrument isn't suitable for them.\n\nI've seen enough people die, over a long enough span, to know there is **zero value** to money that arrives a day late. It is valuable when they really need it, and it is worthless thereafter. There is no point in a network with 99.999% uptime, if the actual transactions get rejected arbitrarily over trivial amounts of money. If someone needed money and they died because you set the BTC fee to $3 instead of $4, well, godspeed. \n\nWatching a good friend die slowly, over the course of months or years, over something you could have easily fixed will make you have no interest in a speculative financial instrument that's unreliable for real payments.",

                    "response": "You've had some excellent replies already, but I'd like to chip in on another reason I find BCH superior, and that's the community that surrounds it.  \n\nI find that the BCH community truly believes in [*A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System* as set forth in the Bitcoin whitepaper](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf), with all the characteristics and benefits that are a natural result, such as censorship-resistance and decentralization.  \n\nThat's why this community cannot abide by the hypocrisy of massive censorship and unwarranted user banning supposedly in support of that aforementioned *censorship-resistant* system, as is exemplified by what the mods of /r/Bitcoin have been doing [since 2015](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/) and are continuing to do to this day.  \n\nThe BCH community welcomes open discussion and criticism. If there's a problem with BCH, we want to try to find ways to fix it. Or if it truly can't be fixed, most here are open-minded enough to consider moving on from it. Most in the BCH community also don't hold BCH as the absolute one and only. Many are interested in other cryptos as well. And if an unqualified *better* idea comes along, folks here seem ready to embrace it (though in my experience, every purportedly *better* idea since Bitcoin was invented has involved significant Pros and Cons -- I've yet to come across one that is objectively *better* in all ways).  \n\nTry the same open-minded discussion approach in /r/Bitcoin, and I think you know you won't get far. Moreover, maxis demand *decentralization* while at the same time maintaining that only a single, supposedly \"reference\" \"BTC\" (SegWit1x) client should ever be allowed (that being Bitcoin Core -- the epitome of centralization). Meanwhile, with BCH we currently have six or more actively developed full node clients, and once had to kick out a main developer (many thought of him as *the* main developer) after he went rogue and tried to centralize and extort BCH development on his own client (Amaury Sechet with Bitcoin ABC).  \n\nThe BCH community has also been actively calling out the massive fraud that is Tether since its earliest days. \"BTC\" maxis tend to be at a minimum apologists for it, if not actively involved in it.  \n\nI also find it ironic that the \"BTC\" (SegWit1x) community constantly proclaims \"Don't Trust. Verify.\" So much so that that phrase has become [an unofficial slogan for Blockstream](https://twitter.com/blockstream/status/1292628658306387968) (the legacy finance-backed company that almost certainly has been the largest factor in co-opting BTC away from its former mission to be \"A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\" -- they [sell T-shirts](https://store.blockstream.com/product/dont-trust-verify-tshirt/) along with their [famous penchant for hats](https://www.excellion.com/product/uasf-v2-hat/)). But anyone that stops to actually apply that advice to the BTC block chain will see that [in November 2017, the \"BTC\" (SegWit1x) chain stopped meeting the definition of Bitcoin, and going forward can never *legitimately* be called Bitcoin ever again](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/rg1yh5/rbitcoin_became_so_bad_due_to_the_censorship/hooengg/).  \n\nThe assault on \"Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash\" that started with the censorship and unwarranted user banning in /r/Bitcoin in 2015 really spread far beyond that one internet forum throughout the entirety of the BTC community. Anyone capable of even a smidgen of independent thought was basically forced out to other projects. Many are still here among the BCH community to this day. We still believe in Bitcoin as set forth by Satoshi Nakamoto, the one that's never stopped functioning and delivering (and, incidentally, one that continues to meet the whitepaper definition of Bitcoin), and I think we'll mostly be here as long as that promise continues to survive in BCH.  \n\nLastly, here are some links to relevant articles you might find interesting (some may have been linked for you elsewhere already):  \n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/rgsvss/what_was_the_reason_for_the_creation_of_this_sub/hopgoy1/  \n\nEdit: Added link to /u/theymos censorship declaration post  \n\nEdit 2: Also forgot to respond to your question on why the BCH fork was a good move: for me it was to save the Bitcoin block chain from the codified set of lies that is Segregated Witness (SegWit).",

I highly doubt that Burger King's PoS allows for the acceptance of cryptocurrencies (but allow for the possibility that I am incorrect), so I am forced to wonder...\n\n(1) Is this franchised location accepting BCH through Buger King's PoS\n\n(2) Is this franchised location accepting BCH via a third party application/PoS (I mean wallet, not Bitpay) and then batch reconciling these purchases as fiat in the Burger King PoS at a later date?\n\n(3) Or another scenario I don't care to type out or am unaware of.",

However, SmartBCH is sorely lacking when it comes to a comparable utility.\n\nI congratulate Jay on doing a wonderful job of building, deploying and growing his (community-funded) block explorer ([smartscan.cash](https://smartscan.cash)); especially since it's 100% completely open source ([https://github.com/jay-bch/smartbch-explorer](https://github.com/jay-bch/smartbch-explorer)). I plan to take a deep dive into the code very soon, and would very much love to know the ROADMAP of what's next for this project..\n\nJust my TOP3 ideas for what I feel is currently missing from smartscan:\n\n1. Contract verification & related dev tools\n2. Network summary on the homepage (price, marketcap, # txs, fees, basic chart(s), etc)\n3. Timestamps / Age (shown on lists) is very sorely missed \ud83d\ude1e\n\nSo why not just clone Etherscan or the many other EVM explorers full of robust features? Answer: They're NOT opensource. Here is an issue ([https://github.com/smartbch/smartbch/issues/44](https://github.com/smartbch/smartbch/issues/44)) that best explains it.\n\nFwiw, I've started developing a set of tools (packaged into a web portal) to fill some of the gaps that I feel are most critical to the safety and security of the several SmartBCH projects I'm currently working on. So, I'd really love to hear thoughts & ideas, from the community, about what the best approach should be to **solving this \"trust/verify\" issue**, in a way that benefits EVERYONE! \ud83d\ude4c\n\nPlease leave your comments below..\n\nCheers!  \nShomari",

It is famous for its flower farms, restaurants and very picturesque inns. It is a perfect destination to share with family or friends, and thus be able to enjoy the wonderful cold weather that is difficult to achieve in the city.\n\n\"Recorriendo Galip\u00e1n\" is in charge of organizing tourist trips and transfers in said locality, and also offering transportation service for those who require it, at incredible prices. Today Deysi Oropez, the CEO of this venture, decided to join the free economy and take a step forward in her town, saying YES to the adoption of Bitcoin Cash within her tourist packages and services.\n\nThis is hard work that the BCH Latam team is doing in Venezuela and that it intends to expand to more Latin American countries in 2022.\n\n**Instagram:**\n\n[**https://www.instagram.com/recorriendo\\_galipan/**](https://www.instagram.com/recorriendo_galipan/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fu96keej85w81.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd3a364bf4b182a7702bb62ed74cd719e59e10a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u7qw9gmk85w81.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ab383a6134987dafa6a256cfb41ff91b07dcec1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v53v009l85w81.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f42dbfda7aefdfc687b29b0efcd54bf10ba626d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/alrf6tnl85w81.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efea93228faa6883490389f90f8dd2c7e1d8f3f1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pl5nm56m85w81.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ed40fc02845be0367fc8db259d95d54ae907529\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ly0y8bn85w81.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=0571d440f7fe373d32b05184d414c3b8b229871a",

I believe the price suppression worked and successfully steered away interest in the network generally. A big contributing factor is that the crypto markets still lack any fundamentals currently, most interest comes from price speculators with 0 interest in fundamentals and utility. Overall we need to do much better to break out from this trend and decoupling from the shit-show.\n\nEnjoy! Tips are welcome. :)\n\np2p money = freedom",

Like web wallets (LOL), and a very short list of one or two more things.\n\nRight now, they are at the second \"project\" being funded.

A breach of less than $36,400 is considered invalid.\n\nThe price of what is the most valuable crypto over the likes of Ethereum, Ripple and Quint may experience a countertrend rally. Wave C of B might be impulsive as the dangerous countertrend move unfolds. \n\nThe price of bitcoin may rise and then fall. \n\nThe Bitcoin price may continue to deceive traders, as Smart Money has successfully conducted a liquidity hunt for the second Monday in a row. Traders attempting to short bitcoin were likely locked in a $33,000 loss due to the BTC price. The price of Bitcoin may continue to rise in order to liquidate as many short traders as possible.\n\nAfter today's fakeout, bitcoin is trading at $40,166. If market conditions continue unchanged for the following several hours, the bulls will have formed a bullish hammer candle, potentially signaling the start of a fresh uptrend surge for Bitcoin. After today's trading session, the volume indicator profile appears to be pointing to bullish price action.\n\nIn light of the present downturn, a probable bull run to $44,000 would complete a classic head and shoulders pattern. The rising rally would be designated wave C of B inside the pattern, so traders should keep it in mind. As a result, once the target is attained, stronger drops may occur. Nonetheless, it's advisable to approach this trading idea cautiously. \n\nA breach below $36,400 invalidates the short-term bullish thesis, implying a 1-1 setup for traders looking for the $44,000 goal. If the bears manage to pass $36,400, the next bearish target would be $33000, implying a decline of up to 17% from the present Bitcoin price.",

He is a Ukrainian and he is helping people in Ukraine to have income. I am very proud of what he's doing.\n\nThey accept crypto payments, including Bitcoin Cash, so if you guys have something relevant to outsource to them, please consider doing so. In addition, I am going to speak to my government officials to see if my country can do more to help these people directly (and connect them with OP). This may be something that you can do as well. Together, with enough people, we can do lots of good.\n\nTheir website: https://uaithub.com/",

The main asset of our community is speed - we have a great team of PMs, so any task can be distributed between many people and can be done faster than you could imagine - motivation it is x)  \nNow we are looking for outsourcing opportunities for them.  \nIf you have any suggestions of how to approach this problem or maybe even have some opportunities for them we, Ukrainians, will deeply appreciate it!  \nThanks everyone in advance!  \n[https://uaithub.com/](https://uaithub.com/)",

As many of you know we were the first team working with the SmartBCH dev team. We helped with testing of the first tesnet, developed a few tools, even helped solve a few small issues. We ported Sushiswap and the RSK bridge to Testnet, ported a explorer and bytecode verification tool. We got support and our Flipstarter got funded after a second attempt for a modest sum.\n\nSince the first day we had a clear vision of what we wanted to create, we did not want to cut any corners and instead bring something that creates value to the community. For mainnet we decided it was extremely important to port Uniswap, instead of its more popular forks that we had deployed on testnet. We understood it was a challenge, but here we are today with a fully functional Uniswap V2 port.\n\nOur plan is moving forward to incorporate as a company, and this also brings lots of regulatory challenges. Unlike other swaps on the ecosystem we cant list or promote \"moon lambo 1000% APR\" tokens to attract liquidity,  so we had in mind the many people that encouraged us to build  would also support us today with liquidity. We were extremely disappointed when our request for help with liquidity was answered with a \"Good luck\" from a main leader of the community. Instead a good job, here is some liquidity, would have give us a great push of confidence and support, with no risk, at no cost!\n\nSo what happens is that there is no incentives for developers but risk. This translates into \"devs\" creating RocketMoonLambo tokens, with the only intention to extract the most value possible from the community, in the shortest time possible, just to repeat it again with a different name. While if there is a team trying to actually bring in value with new code, ideas, and non stop work, all you get is a good luck!\n\nSmartBCH is an amazing platform,  the right incentives need to exist so that more dev teams want to work in it. As for us, we are determine to create real lasting value, with our without support from those who initially encourage us to build.",

OP nailed it: the competition is MoonLambo2000%+ GuaranteedGains+ TechnoBullshit+ Nothingness and the market loves every little bit of it. Actually trying to get people to use crypto? **BORING.**\n\nOP has correctly identified their problem but seems unwilling to address it: the only market demand is from gamblers who are only attracted to scam coins.

            "selftext": "Hi Bitcoin Cash community! About two months ago my Flipstarter campaign was funded:\n\nhttps://flipbackend.bitcoincash.network/media/screenshots/bitcoin-out-loud-flipstarter-february-2022_success_2022-02-14T070258.3477310000.png\n\nThe deliverables from that campaign were one fully animated explainer video, one video interview, one \u201cBitcoin Cash Minute\u201d video, and one \u201cOnes until I\u2019m broke\u201d video (on my gaming channel).\n\nI mentioned in the campaign that I can\u2019t guarantee release dates, but that my goal was to be finished in two months. It\u2019s now two months later and, since I\u2019m not finished delivering yet, I figure it\u2019s time for an update post.\n\nThe animated explainer video is coming along nicely, but slowly. It\u2019s been tough communicating the visuals I want so that the metaphors accurately represent the technical details (or at least don\u2019t imply anything that\u2019s blatantly incorrect), and I\u2019m being picky about it. I think the visuals are looking great though! Here\u2019s a quick preview:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/7cUktbv.mp4\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/cTpPCSs.mp4\n\nFor the video interview, I had a great conversation with Chu Mash, the artist behind the Reapers smartBCH NFT collection. He\u2019s a California native who\u2019s been making art his whole life, and he\u2019s keen on providing value for the community that has grown up around his Reapers NFT\u2019s, and around himself as an artist. Check it out!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqRvLvf1PgU\n\nThe \u201cBitcoin Cash Minute\u201d video has been recorded and is currently being edited/animated. The title is BTC is NOT a good \u201cstore of value\u201d, which I hope will turn some heads =)\n\nFinally, I\u2019ve made several attempts to record the \u201cOnes until I\u2019m broke\u201d video, but the logistics of getting someone else playing the game to accept some BCH have made it difficult. Copy/paste is not possible in chat, and links typed into chat are not clickable. ~50% of players can\u2019t chat at all because they are on console. Asking for emails or other contact info is usually a 1-way ticket to \u201cf u scammer\u201d town, if they haven't already assumed I'm a scammer since I'm talking about crypto =P (I should have seen this coming since my first \u201cOne\u2019s until I\u2019m broke\u201d video was mostly spent finding someone who would respond and was actually interested, but I figured I could make it work.)\n\nCurrently, I\u2019m unsure how I\u2019ll proceed for this last deliverable. Long term, I\u2019d like to transition to hosting Rocket League tournaments with a Bitcoin Cash prize pool so I can coordinate outside of the game by default. For this campaign, I will make sure to deliver on the original intent of the deliverable, if not exactly a \u201cOne\u2019s until I\u2019m broke\u201d video.\n\nThanks again for all of your support!",

There are less people in the world that can afford to make transaction.  You can either have this limit be determined by your technology or by people. If Ethereum's technology would allow for twice as many tx at the same price it would have these. Bitcoin in it's current state can easily have 15 to 20x the amount of tx before something bad happens but it's not allowed by it's code. \n\nWhat happens next is that those people that can't afford to make the transaction just go and use other chains. Perhaps those have other drawbacks like even higher volatility or less security but that does not seem to stop people from using non Bitcoin chains. ltc, xlm, bch all of these are frequently used to move money between exchanges because they are either cheaper or faster or both. \n\nAll of this traffic could have still bit on Bitcoin, had it allowed for let's say 10 MB blocks. And since half of the year 1 sat/byte tx eventually clear .... tx revenenu on BTC could have been 5x higher! \n\nThis is a lot of lost income for BTC miners.",

I begin to track this address because it first appears to me as a exchange, when I watched the amount of BCH in that address went down every day(as sales), I expected the price of BCH to go up. At the time when that wallet went dry(from over 400,000 down to about 2000 BCH left), the price of BCH did not go up as I expected, I did not see it as a big deal as I thought it must be something else that I missed. However, about 1 or 2 days after I begin to hear people saying(as I never use Binance myself)  Binance stopped the withdrawing of BCH from their platform. I share the address here so anyone who is interested can have a look.\n\nThere are many indicators in the historical data of this wallet to support this assumption but I really don't want to write a long article about it. I believe you can easily find them if you have some professional data analysis skill. For example, another interesting spot to look at is the movement of this address during the 2021 May crash.  \n\nFor people here who is living in the US(which I am not), perhaps there is a way to bring this to the SEC to bring justice to the price of BCH. \n\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b717om4dHcDNy9LAagMj8mGW59vyXjvA3GBn\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7",

Now some whales might have enough funds (tether and BCH on Binance and Tether and BCH on other exchanges) that they don't have to move BCH or Tether between exchanges to do arbitage.\n\nEventually if the price goes far enough in one direction they will run out of something somewhere. If they run out of BCH to sell on the other exchange they will HAVE to withdraw BCH from Binance.\n\nIf that BCH is not there it can't be sold on other exchanges.\n\nWhat you are missing is that Tether is the one that keep buying up BCH on Binance, pushing the price back up. Now the flow goes in the other direction. BCH flows back to Binance to be sold for a higher price.\n\nAnd then Tether eventually sells this BCH for BTC.\n\nThe end result is that if the dollar price of BTC goes down, the dollar price of BCH goes down even more.",

(in the hope that this BCH stays on smartBCH to get some interest) \n\nIf we grow big, together with all the other incentives that smartBCH offers, it will become harder and harder to find the needed liquidity to short BCH with. Naked shorting only brings you so far before it collapses. The shorting will always lead to an artificially created lower price of BCH somewhere, which means people will grab that cheap BCH and move it somewhere else to sell it.\n\n\nCurrently this system only surpressed the price because some of that BCH always finds it way back to Binance. \n\nIf the BCH price on Binance is lower but you can't withdraw any BCH to sell for more on other exchanges then the price on Binance stops having an influence on the BCH price on all the other exchanges. \n\nSo once that SHA gate is finally there, if we manage to lock a good 3 to 4 million bch on to smartBCH, that should make the price suppression all by impossible.\n\nIt's really very simple.\n\n95% of all BCH trading should take place on the chain itself, in this case the smartBCH sidechain.\n\nThen such fraud is not possible anymore. \n\nSo if politics ever makes the CEX illegal, that's actually going to work out extremely well for BCH compared to other coins .",

I'm maybe dumb but can someone pls explain it to me, does that mean that when all of them have been mined or traded there are no Bitcoins left for mining anymore?   \n\n\nAs that article said, in the year 2140, the last bitcoin will be mined. No fresh bitcoins may be mined after that? How's that possible?   \nI'm pretty confused right now! Are all currencies limited?  \n\n\nI start buying for example Unicoins, but maybe in a few years there, won't be any left to buy?   \n\n\nI have one more question, I'm confused by this sentence - \"While about 90% of the total possible Bitcoin is already in circulation, the remaining 2.2 million coins will take another 120 years or more to manufacture.\" Does that mean that there will be more coins after all?",

Have you read the [whitepaper](https://www.bitcoin.com/satoshi-archive/whitepaper/)?\n\n> No fresh bitcoins may be mined after that? \n\nCurrently the answer to that question is: \"No, fresh bitcoins may be mined after 21 million have been mined since 21 million is the maximum allowed bitcoins.\" \n\nThat could change in the next 120 years. If it does, one could argue that coin is no longer bitcoin. Or, one could argue that if enough of the mining hash decides to increase the 21 million limit and a bunch of other standards are met, than it would still be bitcoin.\n\n> How's that possible?\n\nWhy wouldn't it be possible? Currently the 21 million maximum coins is a Constant. It is a core Constant that could change, but to change it would create serious havoc, IMO.\n\n> Are all currencies limited? \n\nNo. As mentioned Monero is not, neither is Doge (AFAIK). I would assume many others are.\n\n> I start buying for example Unicoins, but maybe in a few years there, won't be any left to buy? \n\nNo idea. You should ask someone that knows about Unicoin.\n\n>  Does that mean that there will be more coins after all?\n\nNo. It means that approximately 90% of the 21 million coins have been mined and that approximately 10%, or approximately 2.2 million, coins are yet to be mined. The remaining (approximately) 10%,  or 2.2 million, coins will be mined between now and approximately 2140.",

This could have happened anywhere and I think maybe it was just the fact of the proxy arrangement that added to our overall uncertainty and inconvenience.  Please downvote if it sounds like I'm complaining about Purse specifically.\n\nI also want to say that historically we've had good experiences at Purse.  That's partly why recently we felt comfortable enough to order what at my house is a large ticket item.  It was a stainless kitchen appliance, costing something like $2000.  Everything was great until the item arrived very damaged.  Like it had been severely beaten with a baseball bat.\n\nWe were disappointed.  I've just never had something arrive that damaged before and everyone was looking for someone to blame.  But, stuff happens and more stuff happens these days.  So anyway we initiated the return through Purse.  An admin there immediately refunded the funds we had spent.  So, at that point we were taken care of.  But, we also still had the item.  The earner then had to initiate a return with the Amazon seller to get their money back, and to get me a return authorization number, just so the item could be shipped back.  And this actually took many more days with many messages going back and forth, pictures, etc, between myself and the earner and the Amazon seller.  There was typically a delay of a day or so for each party's response.  It ended up actually being a lot of correspondence necessary to get the return authorization.  Anyway that finally worked out, we got the return number, a few days later the item was picked up by the carrier and some time after that the earner got their funds refunded.  So nobody lost any money.  \n\nThere had been a lot of inconvenience for all parties.  It was probably over a month from the time the order was placed to the time my ongoing interaction was no longer needed.  After all that, we wanted to tip the earner since everything had taken so long and they had done a lot of work for nothing and much of it on our behalf to facilitate the return.  I inquired with the Purse admin about how to accomplish this.  The admin explained they would have to deduct the funds from our Purse account and transfer them to the earner.  I then asked them to send the earner $100 of BCH.  My family had suggested this amount and I agreed.  As it turned out, more than that was deducted.   This ended up being a sore point for one person in my group.  But I've thought about it, and the BCH price was fluctuating at this time, and by the time we requested the tip, weeks had passed actually since the start of the transaction.  Just due to the nature of the proxy order and then having to relay messages and all that.  We were just happy it was over.\n\nSo after writing all that down I just want to say again, I don't want to complain about Purse.  Feel free to downvote my post if it seems like a complaint.  Because things worked out about as best as they could especially given these strange times.  And this could have happened anywhere.",

But one thing that left a bad taste in my mouth was how the facilitator issued a complaint against me for not releasing the funds before the items even arrived. I wasn't paying attention to the purse site while I was waiting on my stuff, so on the day the items arrived, I visited the site to release funds and leave positive feedback, only to be greeted by a message from purse stating that the facilitator left a complaint and if I didn't release funds in x < 24 hours they would release the funds for me. If for any reason I didn't receive the items, and I had waited a day or more for them to arrive, I would have come back to find my funds released, whether or not I actually received the items.",

It usually works for Amazon US and UK markets, but after I was forced to start using Amazon DE because of Brexit (UK leaving EU and customs cost going up), [Purse.io](https://Purse.io) has been a really bad experience with orders not fulfilling etc. I gave up on it.\n\nThe only reliable service with a fair markup I have found that has a nice collection of giftcards that can be used in the EU is Bitrefill, and since they don't support non-custodial BCH (only through Coinbase) I always convert to Dash or Doge when buying from Bitrefill.   \n\n\nCoinsbee works too (and support payment with BCH), but has expensive markup.",

With Purse there was a BCH price drop over **5 days**, combined with the fee. Purse earners can buy the dip by only filling your order exactly when BCH price dips.\n\nTbh nothing's available on Airtm right now. But I'd bet something will be available sometime today. I think the waiting time would be less. Maybe more people are taking the gift cards lately (more demand than supply).\n\nI can't withdraw from Purse, but I have to wait a business day to see why.\n\nWith Airtm, make sure you activate 2FA before depositing. I lost over $40 because a hacker used my [mail.com](https://mail.com) email to reset my Airtm password. **Only** Airtm let the hacker get away with it!\n\nI'd use Binance P2P to get the AirUSD. BCH works as a Store-of-Value on Binance, because the trading is going to be in tether (the wage-slave token).",

Here are the details:\n\nthe open streetmap concepts require that you map based on the physical location. Its a map after all.\n\nSo when a company that takes 30% from an order allows you to pay with crypto on their website FOR a restaurant that is nice. But when you go to that restaurant and at the location you can't pay with crypto, then that is not useful.  \n\nPeople need to be able to count on the OSM data being correct. If I go and have a holiday in Kiel and expect to be able to pay everything with BCH because OSM said so, I would be very sad that 50 restaurants have been tagged where I can't actually pay with BCH.\n\nPlease check the wiki for why details on tagging, you can find the page here; https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency\n\ncc /u/simon-v",

The point is that if you walk into the restaurant and want to check if you can pay with BCH, you will be told you can't. That is when you should not tag it as such.\n\nSee it like this; you should not advertise that you can pay with BCH at Amazon. Because you confuse people that just go to Amazon. Instead they would have to go to purse.io or similar.\n\nSo the point is about verifiability. Can a stranger walk up to the tagged location and come to the same conclusion as you did about being able to pay with BCH at that location.\n\nWhile in both these cases you can pay with BCH if you know the trick. Go to a specific website and order there and pay there instead of directly. But that is not the normal way of doing things, not verifiable.\n\nHaving to order from a 3rd party company (not advertised at location) doesn't quality. (Especially when you realize you need to KYC with Bitpay ;-)\n\n> Wouldn't disallowing this sort of arrangement also rule out some commonly used payment processors, such as BitPay or GoCrypto?\n\nThe payment processor can have a contract with the seller at the location, typically to have some payment hardware there (gocrypto does that). At which point a person being at a certain location will be able to ask staff about Crypto / BCH and pay with the staff. And that is verifiable, which is the basic requirement of OSM.\n\n > Edit: Could you, please, provide a brief summary of affected nodes (count, region)? I'd like to have something on hand when explaining the issue to my peers.\n\nThis is just Germany and really just about 5 cities. Basically all the high numbers on where2 cash in cities in Germany. (Kiel, Bremen, Lubeck, Oldenburg, Paderborn). A lot of places still likely have the not-verified `currency:BCH=yes` tag, I hope that on-the-ground checks can fix those.\n\nPersonally I ask anyone tagging to be very careful. This is not a \"numbers go up\" kind of things, this is an adoption-by-exepriencing thing. Try some locations and notice the tagging is wrong, you lose all credibility in the map, so correctness is more important than some global unverified number going up. A verified number going up is tons more useful than just creating another useless copy of maps,bitcoin,com.",

Tools like charge-lnd are widely used by most node operators (I use it as well) to automate channel fee and redirect/block liquidity flow.\n2. Big Noded operators have very strict rules, min channel size, min fees, min activity or they will close your channel right away.\n3. Big Nodes operators like exchanges are kinda centralized, they have a few channels with a lot of BTC to  other Big Nodes in popular custodial Wallets like Wallet of Satoshi where you don't have control and they will just ban you if you misbehave.",

You can't stress or break it because I don't think you can create enough diversity/entropy to generate any stress.\n\nYou'd have to find a few hundred unique destinations to make your spends, and find diverse routes, which would be difficult, if not near impossible. Even more difficult is having all participants finding diverse endpoints and not simply overlap the same hundred spends. As soon as any reasonable routes are found, they would be depleted and any additional stress is simply shed by rejecting transactions.\n\nInstead of diversity, assume all trxs are all run against the same central hubs. Once again, if these become saturated then trxs simply fail. Stress on the network is shed by a failure to start.\n\n*With LN routing, if a route can't be found, it's the clients fault, and not the network's problem.* So you really can't stress a network that effectively tells users to piss off once it reaches any form of saturation. **You can't tell the difference between a failure from stress (under load) or the many other ways LN can fail.**\n\nAlso the fees to open and close channels add to the self regulation. This barrier to entry and exit naturally chills any efforts to stress the network, let alone use it outright.",

He told the business associate that he didn't have \"much of a choice\" in the matter.\n\n>After the explosion in Navalny's bitcoin donations, the FSB started exploring how to identify his crypto donors, according to the person familiar with the matter. The FSB, the person said, instructed Rosfin to find a way to achieve that goal. Responding to questions from Reuters, Rosfin said it is prohibited from disclosing measures to combat terrorist financing. It said Navalny was involved in \"terrorist activity.\"\n\n>In April 2021, a Russian non-profit organisation called the Digital Economy Development Fund invited Binance to a private meeting with Rosfin at a government building in Moscow, according to the invitation seen by Reuters. The organisation is headed by a former top advisor to Putin on internet policy, German Klimenko, and was set up in 2019 to develop Russian technologies. The fund's website says one of its partners is the Russian trade and industry ministry. Kostarev, the Binance director, chairs the fund's committee on digital currencies.\n\n[Navalny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexei_Navalny#:~:text=On%2020%20August%202020%2C%20Russian,was%20hospitalized%20in%20serious%20condition.)\n\n>On 20 August 2020, Russian opposition figure and anti-corruption activist\u00a0Alexei Navalny\u00a0was poisoned with a\u00a0Novichok\u00a0nerve agent\u00a0and was hospitalized in serious condition.\u00a0",

This would remove any issue of balance swings on the buyer's side while an order is pending acceptance\n        \nor perhaps the earner could have an option to accept flexUSD instead of converting to BCH at order acceptance",

So, although, this fund (and it's ilk) are technically backed by crypto, regulators deliberately broke all functionality that would allow for dynamic price discovery to \"protect\" the qualified investors (but NOT actually).\n\nIf the share price was a penny, you can't quickly cash it out for the BCH worth $2.95. If the share price was a million, you couldn't place 100(?) BCH and get a billion dollars(?) in arbitrage. It's bad by design so that the fund CANNOT affect the price of BCH.\n\nIt's actually the broken parts that make it interesting. If you look at the chart, qualified investors that 'placed' BCH with the fund prior to Aug 2020 couldn't sell their resulting shares of BCHG for a year. No sellers means a higher price, so from August 2020 until August 2021, BCHG carried some ridiculous premium (10-30x at times), because no one could sell their placement.\n\nAfter that period expired, 1) the volume exploded from ~1M shares a month to 9-12M/month 2) the trust premium collapsed from +1000% to a 30-50% discount.\n\nHowever, over the course of a year, the volume is now back down to 1M shares a month, and this admittedly puny 11,847 share trade **was actually a third of the daily volume.** DCG has authorized $100M to buy up depressed shares of these funds, but at that scale, it would take them months to allocate even a small portion of that to BCHG and it would certainly affect the price.\n\nThese funds are basically suffering from a well-defined two year long square function of manipulation (created by regulators), which makes it like harpooning whales in a tank, if you have the patience and the appetite for \"qualified investor\".\n\nMaybe a tank is a bad analogy. The SEC basically harpooned these qualified investors and left them tied up along the side of the vessel overnight. And it was feeding time for all the creatures of the sea to eat them til their heart's content. But we're getting into the scraps of the carcasses when the volume is 30k shares a day. The party is probably coming to an end and we're likely going into the other side of the step function on a deliberately broken instrument.\n\nEDIT: \n\nThe decorous mode of consuming a whale is in bites. If there is more than you could ever eat, bring friends. Obviously, you should not attempt it in one go.",

            "selftext": "Some interesting Bitcoin facts, some of which you've certainly previously heard, but it was fun for me to recall them.  \n\n\n1. The honey badger is Bitcoin\u2019s unofficial animal mascot  \n2. The maximum number of bitcoins isn\u2019t really 21 million - In fact, it\u2019s 20,999,987.4769 or thereabouts. It\u2019s expected that the last bitcoin amount will be mined sometime between the years 2128 and 2140.  \n3. You can run Ethereum smart contracts on top of Bitcoin   \n4. Satoshi Nakomoto disappeared right after Gavin Andresen went to the CIA  \n5. Bitcoin was used to circumvent the WikiLeaks banking blockade, to Satoshi\u2019s displeasure  \n6. Julian Assange later thanked the blockade for forcing WikiLeaks to hold Bitcoin  \n7. Bitcoin is only used about 10% for crime according to the DEA  \n8. The average Bitcoiner is a male European or American between 25 to 34 years of age  \n9. The first recorded Bitcoin transaction was a pizza purchase (we're all remembering that very well lol)  \n10. Holding Bitcoin, gold, and oil in a single crypto wallet might balance the risk and stabilize the total return, which is made possible by Duet Protocol.  \n11. Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is beamed to the whole world via satellites - One potential attack on Bitcoin would be to shut down the internet, or take some action against the transmission of Bitcoin data over the internet.   \n12. Since 2017, Bitcoin has had higher annual transaction values than PayPal  \n13. The First Mortgage in Bitcoin Happened in 2019 - It was given to Brock Pierce. He spent more than 3,000,000 BTC on buying a renewed chapel in Amsterdam. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h83tvf37t1v81.jpg?width=564&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ca46b1810f79ba3356e8adc3550868fa4155dbb",

He could help drive adoption, but he really really likes to pretend he invented everything he touches, and he ALWAYS needs to be the guy in charge. He could do more damage to BCH than Craig, Calvin, and Amaury combined if he even half-heartedly tried to. After all he has orders of magnitude more resources.\n\nI think that anyone who is in this because they believe in Global, decentralized permissionless digital cash should be extremely skeptical of any \"help\" that Elon wants to extend.\n\nHope for the best, plan for the worst. Flat power structures (like BCH is trying to build) are notoriously vulnerable to fracturing and balkanization (as we've seen). I think he's cynical enough to burn the whole thing to the ground if he ended up just a little bit richer than he started.",

After some time it should stop and you will be able to tell the balance.",

                    "response": "My rationale for switching from BTC and BCH is looking back in history of similar situations. Lets take IBM for example. They were once the most dominant company in the computer industry since its inception. But after awhile they got complacent with being top dog and stopped being innovative. Meanwhile we had Apple which had very small beginnings being started in a garage but it had a grand vision of what the future of the potential of what a personal computer was capable of and how it could change everyone's lives and the world for the better.  \n\n\nThat's how I feel when I see cryptocurrency. A lot of projects are just about number go up,  trading, staking, speculation, digital gold, things that... are just not very exciting or empowering. Which is probably why a lot of the mainstream isn't paying attention to crypto because most of the market is just focused on a bunch of kids trying to get rich quick.  \n\n\nVery few projects actually have a grand vision of how blockchain technology can really change the world and empower everyone with a peer to peer electronic cash system. A transparent money system with no middle man and anyone can use it anytime 24 / 7 without permission. It is quite magical when you think about it. Just like how computers were quite magical when they were first introduced.  \n\n\nI think 10 or 20 years from now. When people look back on this, I think the answers and the future will seem so obvious. Hindsight 20 / 20",

            "selftext": "Hi Everyone! Bitcoin\u2019s been catching a lot of heat lately over its energy consumption. Article after article comes out that decry its harm to the environment. \n\nBut the truth is far more comforting than a handful of seemingly harsh data points about Bitcoin and the environment. I wanted to create this post to equip every miner and Bitcoiner with the arguments they need to spread the truth about Bitcoin\u2019s impact on the environment.\n\nHow could such an energy-consuming technology benefit the Green Movement?\n\nIn short, there\u2019s more to Bitcoin than its critics appreciate.\n\n**Bitcoin mining renders renewable energy sources viable.** \n\nIn April 2021, Jack Dorsey\u2019s Square released a white paper boldly titled, \u201cBitcoin is Key to an Abundant, Clean Energy Future\u201d. Early in the memo, the authors explained that the costs for solar and wind energy have recently dropped by 90% and 71%, respectively. Suffice to say that green alternatives are rapidly gaining steam on the cost side of the ledger.\n\nBut as explained above, it\u2019s difficult to match supply of solar and wind energy to demand. Demand for energy peaks in the early evening, when people are home and using appliances. At that time, though, the sun is already setting, and wind is always unpredictable.\n\n**Enter Bitcoin mining**\n\nMiners can work from anywhere, so long as they\u2019re connected to a power source and the internet. Because of this, they can act as \u2018an energy buyer of last resort\u2019: whenever supply of wind or solar exceeds demand, miners can jump in and pay for the privilege of using the energy to mine Bitcoin. This will render renewable energy far more profitable, and will therefore incentivize the creation of *more* green energy sources.\n\nSquare\u2019s white paper puts it succinctly: \u201cBitcoin miners\u2026offer highly flexible and easily interruptible load\u2026and are completely location agnostic, requiring only an internet connection. \\[They are\\] an energy buyer of last resort that can be turned on or off at a moment\u2019s notice anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\n**Bitcoin is one of the cleanest industries on the planet**\n\nIn 2021, the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) published the results of a voluntary survey that investigated the electricity consumption and sustainable power mix of about one-third of the Bitcoin network. They discovered that those surveyed used electricity fed by 67% sustainable power. The surveyors inferred that the entire Bitcoin network\u2019s sustainable electricity mix had increased to 56%, making it among the greenest industries in the world.\n\nIn contrast, electricity in the United States is only 30.5% sustainable, and electricity in China is less than 15% sustainable. \n\n**Bitcoin mining employs energy that would\u2019ve otherwise gone to waste**\n\nAs Caitlin Long, CEO of Avanti Financial Group, said in a recent documentary, \u201cMore than 2/3 of the energy produced in the world is waste energy, because it\u2019s produced during the hours of the day when there\u2019s not demand to consume it\u2026it\u2019s also produced in a place where there\u2019s not transmission to move it across space and time, and so that energy goes unused and wasted.\u201d \n\nCrusoe Energy and others are tackling this issue with bitcoin Mining. The company raised 128 million dollars in 2021 to build data centers and Bitcoin mining operations that use this wasted energy and reduce methane emissions.\n\nCrusoe Energy operates out of North Dakota, where 500 million cubic feet of gas are flared daily. The company runs forty data centers that harness flared natural gas as of 2021. Soon, they expect to operate 100 units across six states.  \n\nCo-founder of Crusoe Energy, Lochmiller, said that \u201cWhere we view our power consumption, we draw a very clear line in our project evaluation stage where we\u2019re reducing emissions for\u2026oil and gas projects.\u201d\n\n**Energy consumption drives progress and so doesn\u2019t require defending**\n\nProfessor Vaclav Smil\u2019s *Energy and Civilization: A History* traces the relationship between energy consumption and human progress. To take one example, he explains that a typical 1900 Great Plains farmer employed at most 5 kilowatts of power to plow his field using horses. In 2000, a farmer couple can employ over 250 kilowatts of power with a diesel engine, all while \u201csitting high above the ground in the air-conditioned comfort of his tractor cabin.\u201d\n\nSmil\u2019s thesis aligns with our common sense. There is a reason that modern cities consume more energy than ancient villages, that airplanes consume more energy than horses, and that calculators consume more energy than abacuses. Seen in this light, even *if* Bitcoin was the most energy-intensive money ever invented, that does not mean that we should continue using gold and fiat currencies. A more comprehensive comparison should compare all of the costs *and* benefits conferred on humanity by each money. \n\nTo critics of Bitcoin who appeal to its energy consumption, I ask: why is environmental impact the standard by which you judge an innovation, rather than the benefit said innovation would confer on humanity? \n\nIf you are interested in ways of pushing this movement and have more questions regarding changing the current paradigm around Bitcoin mining and the environment, Sazmining, a renewable energy Bitcoin mining venture, is hosting an [AMA](https://investor.sazmining.com/ama-sign-up-page/) today at 1 pm ET. Their AMAs are super interesting to listen to, and they love to get questions from fellow miners and Bitcoiners.",

If Bitcoin ever sees widespread adoption, only the wealthy will be able to afford L1 transactions, which are required to open and close LN channels and adjust liquidity. This effectively means the poor will be forced to establish LN channels with large centralized nodes.\n\nThese centralized nodes will ultimately become middlemen that can charge fees and surveil all traffic through them. Even though theoretically people will have the freedom to move their BTC liquidity to other channels, in reality the economics of the situation will make it impossible and people without much wealth will be stuck without a choice.\n\nIt appears to me that in their apparent quest to pursue maximum decentralization by limiting the blocksize, Bitcoiners have actually locked themselves into a solution that will guarantee centralization if it is adopted at scale. I hope this isn't actually the case and I am wrong, but I can't predict any other result given what I understand.",

                    "response": "The International Monetary Fund published a report detailing how Bitcoin disrupts the world order, enables sovereignty amid sanctions, and demands regulatory action.The IMF recently published the Global Financial Stability Report that details a great deal involving the state of the global economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSubjects discussed in the report include: bitcoin as a means to avoid sanctions, the fragmentation of the old payments and banking infrastructure, and a global call to action for the regulation and control of assets like bitcoin to prevent further systemic degradation.\u201cThe IMF says that \"strengthening macroeconomic policies is necessary\" to fend off \"cryptoization risks.\u201d\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently published the \u201cGlobal Financial Stability Report\u201d which discussed a myriad of subjects including: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies disrupting the payments system, bitcoin being used to evade sanctions, inflation, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, banking infrastructure, central bank challenges of maintaining credibility, energy security, and many other topics.\n\nOne clear point of concern for the IMF is the reverberations felt across the world from the invasion of Ukraine. The report states that through poor market liquidity, counterparty risks, funding strains and the overexposure of financial institutions being strangled throughout the invasion, these conditions led to \u201ccryptoization,\u201d or what many Bitcoiners would refer to as hyperbitcoinization.The result of the invasion led to an influx of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies flooding into the hands of those that needed it most. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany companies have taken their own initiative to further the amount of bitcoin donations, such as Bitcoin Magazine. Ukrainian reliance on outside funding has shown the fragility of the current monetary and payments system, as bitcoin was capable of offering instantaneous relief. \n\nThe report states:\u201cCapital markets might become more fragmented, with possible implications for the role of the US dollar. And the fragmentation of payment systems could be associated with the rise of central bank digital currency blocs.\u201dNot only can payment disruptions happen with bitcoin, but the IMF is also concerned about the quantity of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) being developed. As the system fragments and central banks become even more autonomous, the current banking infrastructure is left in a deluge of exponential technological advancements cascading into a game of keep up.This fragmentation increases in severity as nation-states begin to act outside the purview of the established world order.\n\n El Salvador started an initial chain-reaction in 2021 that led to explosive growth in the Bitcoin network as it made bitcoin legal tender, but the international geo-political stage of 2022 belongs to Russia. \n\nOne primary concern listed in the report for the IMF is nation-states like Russia utilizing protocols such as Bitcoin as a way of skirting economic sanctions:\u201cOver time, sanctioned countries could also allocate more resources toward evading sanctions through mining. Mining for energy-intensive blockchains like Bitcoin can allow countries to monetize energy resources, some of which cannot be exported due to sanctions.\u201dThe IMF notes that the monthly average revenue for all bitcoin mining for last year equated to $1.4 billion. They estimate that Russian miners could have captured up to 11% of that and Iranian miners may have captured up to 3%. \n\nWhile economic sanctions may slow down the pace of the Russian ruble, bitcoin historically appreciates in an extreme manner allowing participants in the network to not only function in the crumbling financial system of the world order, but profit. \n\nThe report states:\u201cTo fend off cryptoization risks, strengthening macroeconomic policies is necessary but may not be sufficient given the unique challenges posed by the crypto ecosystem.\u201dThe IMF mentions that central bank digital currencies may stagnate some of the growth being experienced by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with the emergence of central bank digital currencies. This opinion is based on the assumption that CBDCs will function as a superior monetary network, thereby taking away some of the demand from other currencies. \n\nThe report then calls for global cooperation and precise actions from lawmakers to prevent further fragmentation of the global payments infrastructure.\n\nThe main takeaway from this report should be that Bitcoin has fragmented the world order with a superior payment network, and the old guard is nervous.",

All the other exchanges either lack the required liquidity or run fractional themselves.\n\nIt really can't be that expensive to start a chain reaction of exchanges being forced to buy BCH on another exchange to satisfy customer withdrawls leading to a higher bch price forcing other exchanges to do the same leading to shorts get liquididated which causes bch buys leading  to a higher bch price, etc etc. \n\nIf a whale with 100 million dollars comes along and decides to manipulate the BCH price upwards he could easily double or tripple the price in a very short time. \nProblem is he would run in to Tether and so far the super big whales (tesla, microstrategy) have only ever worked with Tether, never against them ....\n\nIf you want to beat Tether at their own game you are going to need a solid 10B. And if Tether is CIA ....well forget it. RIP.\n\nOf course the entire idea of BCH is that if it actually offers utility eventually the market itself perfectly figures out it's value and it stabilizes. So such a thing would never happen through a whale, because BCH whales don't play the game like that. It could however happen through something like smartBCH locking up most of the BCH float leading to a supply shock on the other markets. \n\nBCH is actually, in terms of trading volume and liquidity in a pretty descent positions compared to most other top 30 coins. And in terms of how decentralised it's holdings are it's in the top 3. (something like solana has 1 entity controlling 70% of the supply which means once the VC's decide it's time to take most of the profit it can do -90% in a couple of months) \n\nWhen the bear market really hits, BCH will be back in the top 10 in no time. And the next bull run will see smartBCH firmly established among the top EVM's which will most likely assure it goes back in to the top 7, perhaps even top 5.",

With that logic we should have stayed at 1MB blocks since we don't usually fill those either.\n\nThe demand is there. The reason the demand isn't finding our blockchain is because it's still unproven to scale in the real world. There I said it.\n\nWe should have already published a 256MB mainnet test block. The only reason we haven't is lack of focus. No offense to you or anyone out there. Devs tend to congregate around trendy problems to be solved, which is why we now have a derelict token system instead of a more scalable blockchain.\n\nI am here to help us regain focus. Any goal that supersedes scaling is a bad goal.\n\nThanks again for your contributions. I respect your work.",

I don\u2019t seem to get a proper answer.\n\nAssuming a target of 1 transaction per person per day for 1 billion humans (between 1 and 10% adoption, or so), you would get 1 billion transactions in 24 hours. Assuming even block generation of one block every 10 minutes, we get 144 blocks per 24 hours.\n\nEach of those 144 blocks, would then contain ~7 million transactions.\n\nAssuming a block subsidy of 0 BCH/block, and a per-transaction fee of 1 US cent, each block would earn a fee of ~$70k.\n\nThat is 35x what they are currently earning, but only 1/3rd of what a BTC block is earning today.\n\nIf the adoption is higher, say 10 transactions per day, for 10 billion humans, then the per-block reward in fees alone ends up at $7,000k per block instead.\n\nIt's very speculative, and the \"dollar\" here is probably not going to be worth the same, but what would it take to get there?\n\nWell, assuming payment transactions vastly dominate the chain, and such transactions typically taking 400 bytes, it works out to 2.8gb blocks for the first case, and 280gb blocks for the later.\n\nThat scale is not feasable on todays internet, and that level of signature validation is not feasable on commodity processors today.\n\nSucks, right? Well, the block reward is not 0 yet, and 50 years ago top-modern computers were working with kilobytes of data, and CPU cycles were measured in megahertz.\n\nGiven todays commodity computers and first-world internet connections, the gigablock testnet initive (many years ago now) and later measurements have confirmed that gigabyte sized blocks are possible.\n\nIn fact, many of the node softwares are already capable of this and have proven it on testnets.",

That will try to consistently reduce the number of coins (utxos). This is a good way to have larger coins that are useful for purchases.\n\nIf you let the normal setting go forever, it will stabilize eventually around a target number of coins (calculated according to some internal details).\n\nFor clarity, make sure to separate in your mind the difference between coins (utxos) and addresses.

            "selftext": "Good news everyone, this is the continuation to our previous post on bridges, here is the previous post. [https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/u2v2sn/the\\_internet\\_of\\_value/](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/u2v2sn/the_internet_of_value/)\n\nA perfect bridge between SmartBCH and Ethereum as an example, would allow anyone to instantly move a token, for a very small fee at no risk. At least with the tools that we currently have available, such a bridge is very unlikely to happen. Because of how blockchains work if you want a bridge that is very fast, there is a risk of a block reorganization creating an imbalance on the bridge, so you could choose to have a very fast bridge, yet it won't be secure.\n\nNow lets say you want a bridge that is optimized for security, you will need to wait for finality, that means that a set of blocks is unlikely to be replaced with a different set of transactions, so in this case it won't be fast. Perhaps you can pay some kind of insurance on your transaction, so it will be fast and \u201csecure\u201d, but it won't be cheap. **Select two from, fast, cheap and secure, what will you want in your bridge?**  Would you mind having to wait a bit in order to get a secure transaction for a low fee? That is what we believe we should build. A very resilient and inexpensive bridge, one that is optimized for security and low transaction cost. Yet users don't want to wait, and there is a solution to that.  The bridge can be built with two layers. The first layer provides the actual token transfer protocol. While a second layer takes care of the final user with support, great UX, and speed in exchange for a small fee.\n\nWe have discussed before how that first **protocol** layer works, now let's go over how the second **service layer** would work. We already have something like this on SmartBCH: the great service of [https://www.coinflex.com](https://www.coinflex.com) and [https://hop.cash/](https://hop.cash/) will bridge a user BCH to SmartBCH and back. These services makes it possible by having liquidity on both sides,  to do settlement later using the current service of CoinFlex (that will be replaced by Sha-Gate). A service layer is not doing work directly at protocol level, but allowing users access to the protocol and charging a small fee for a great fast service and support of its users.\n\nUsers that don't mind waiting a few hours can securely and cheaply bridge their tokens, while those that need something quick can make use of a service built on top of the bridge. Those services can then from time to time put all transactions together and settle them with one transaction to balance their liquidity on the protocol layer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Service layer and Protocol layer bridge](https://preview.redd.it/dsak1tq5ebu81.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a461bc900bcbf0d371922bb04f5c73a29726fd9)\n\nBut why do Signatories wait hours before they certify a bridge transaction?\n\n## Vitalik discussing bridges\n\n\u201cNow, imaging what happens if you move 100 ETH onto a bridge on Solana to get 100 Solana-WETH, and then Ethereum gets 51% attacked. The attacker deposited a bunch of their own ETH into Solana-WETH and then reverted that transaction on the Ethereum side as soon as the Solana side confirmed it. The Solana-WETH contract is now no longer fully backed, and perhaps your 100 Solana-WETH is now only worth 60 ETH. Even if there's a perfect ZK-SNARK-based bridge that fully validates consensus, it's still vulnerable to theft through 51% attacks like this.\u201d\n\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama\\_we\\_are\\_the\\_efs\\_research\\_team\\_pt\\_7\\_07\\_january/hrngyk8/](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/)\n\nVitalik would undeniably prefer that all value stays inside of Ethereum. Vitalik mentions this attack where a chain is reverted after the attacker bridges back value, leaving the bridge no longer fully backed. What Vitalik does not mention is that it is exactly this reason why transfer of bridges takes time. You see, the longer time a Signatory waits to certify a bridging transaction, the more expensive and risky the attack described by Vitalik gets.  So for example, if a Signatory bridge waits 24 hours before it certifies a deposit on the locking contract, then it means the attacker would have to be able to do an attack that reverts the chain 24 hours. Very expensive and risky for the attacker as his chances to succeed would be extremely small. The time no only makes the attack very expensive but allows for the community to be alerted on it, to stop it. But then 24 hours is a long time for a regular user to wait, that is why we propose a two layers bridge platform. As for the service providers working on top of the protocol bridge, doing settlement once a day wouldn't be a problem and would actually result in fee savings. We can then have the best of both worlds, a bridge that is fast, secure and with the right fees in exchange for great service and support. Notice that while we mention hours, Signatories actually look at block height, that is the number of blocks.\n\nOur proposal for a Signatory built, two layers bridge, fixes the bridge trilemma, with a service that is secure, cheap an fast. **It enables a true internet of value where coins, tokens and nfts, freely and securely flows through different chains, and not a world of independent networks.**\n\nWe will be doing one more post on the bridge, on the next one we will like to share some details on how cross chain swaps work, and how we can create a series of incentives to move value from other networks into SmartBCH, this being our main objective.\n\nIf you would like to support our work on bridges and learn more about our project, you can join us on our Telegram Channel: [https://t.me/+Hi\\_qG5A59IhiZGQx](https://t.me/+Hi_qG5A59IhiZGQx)",

                    "response": "This video makes some mistakes at the beginning.\n\n> Initially, gold coins were used for payments. However this changed over time as more intermediaries got involved. The first step was an introduction of gold receipts (IOUs). Gold is inconvenient to carry and difficult to use for payments. For this reason, intermediaries such as banks were introduced to solve this problem. People started storing their gold in bank vaults and using paper gold receipts issued by banks in trade. It became common that gold owners didn't even touch their gold at all as they could always use their IOUs for payments.\n\nThis can perfectly describe a scenario of **private and free banking with no central bank and no government regulation.** In this situation, private banks issue private debt (backed by gold or some other asset), and customers purchase that debt and trade with it.\n\nIn a free banking system, banks can decide how much gold reserve (or any other asset) they want to have in their vaults to be able to pay at any time that debt. **This is called fractional reserve banking, and it appears voluntarily in a free market without any intervention nor coercion from the state.**\n\nIn a free market, a bank cannot issue debt indefinitely, because if all the customers wanted to liquidate their debt at the same time to receive actual gold, the bank wouldn't have enough gold to pay them (for example during a bank run). In this circumstance, what would happen is that the bank would enter bankrupcy. In order to avoid bankrupcy, each bank decides in its own how much reseve ratio they are willing to bear, knowing that less ratio entails more risk but also more benefits.\n\n> Since people mostly used IOUs for payments, this have led to the phase of unlimited fiat currencies.\n\nThis is false. **Government regulation of free banking is what led to fiat currencies.** Without that regulation, private banks would continue to issue as many IOUs as they were comfortable with, and **it wouldn't lead to unlimited currencies.** Nor would those currencies fit the definition of *fiat* currency, because they wouldn't be imposed by government decree.\n\n**A free market can function with IOUs, and this situation doesn't lead to government intervention.**\n\n> Intemediaries which stored peoples gold started issuing more gold receipts than there was gold in bank reserves. Overtime, gold receipts were unlinked from gold completely.\n\nThis leap is untrue. Issuing more gold receipts than reserves doesn't unlink the receipts form gold because of the risk of bankrupcy. **In a capitalist free market, you must honor your contracts, which means paying back your debt. If you don't, there are legal consequences.**\n\n> This led to modern fiat currencies and fractional reserve banking where currencies and credit is created out of thin air.\n\nNo. Privately issued bank IOUs and private fractional reserve banking do not lead to modern fiat currencies.\n\n**What leads to fiat currencies is when the government forbids, by decree, doing business with gold or privately issued gold IOUs.** Then, in a first stage, the government imposes their own gold-backed IOUs. But since the state cannot face bankrupcy because bureaucrats can steal money from ~~slaves~~ citizens through taxes, the state can issue as many IOUs as they want (that is, until people would revolt if they are taxed more).\n\nIn a second stage, the government breaks the promise of repaying the IOUs and thus the government paper becomes the modern fiat we all use now.\n\n> If sound money isn't used for daily payments, humanity doesn't benefit from it because IOUs get introduced and their supply is inflated to infinity.\n\nAgain, this is false because dealing with private IOUs doesn't lead to infinite supply. It is government-issued IOUs that cause that problem.",

Unlike what most people will come to believe. The problem is that we hold our profits too highly that we never do anything with it and we happen to lose out at every junction. This is why there are systems like Binance Pay and exeno that offer users the full capacity to buy with crypto directly, the latter offering a full reinvented system that\u2019s making a name for itself in the market. \n\nI know of a couple of people who have bought full cars with Bitcoin and I\u2019m pretty sure some journalists were using crypto to make exchanges during the Ukraine war.

Never seen it but It's so widely used that we must be able to learn something from it. \n\nWhat are your favorite features of any wallet you've used? BCH can more than support anything you've seen elsewhere. But what is the right combination of essential and full featuredness? What should a wallet do that no one has considered yet? For example I wish a wallet could do datestamp file hashes.\n\nRemember when Gmail became the default email provider? They very specifically literally said \"we think email can be more fun\" and they set up to truly make the best email interface that new users prefer as well as many power users. A Gmail level wallet does not exist yet for crypto. If people were introduced to BCH as painlessly and fun as Gmail introduces grandmas to email, that will drive adoption more than yet another wallet that looks like a calculator.",

Legally speaking, every single transaction is a taxable event if I understand correctly. Between two individuals and things like craigslist, Facebook marketplace etc there'd be no issue. But for a fully compliant brick and mortar merchant, I don't know why they would choose to accept crypto at all.\nThe US doesn't have nearly as big of a problem as other countries when it comes to hyperinflation, access to banks/credit cards/financial tools etc. So what's the incentive for adoption? \nEspecially when a merchant can accept cashapp and other low/no fee instant transactions.\nYou'd have to be pretty idealistic to want to deal with the headache of tax and legal compliance to accept crypto.\nMaybe south Florida can have success specifically because it is a tourist destination hotspot. So it's convenient for foreign visitors and remittances.\nAnyways, I'd love to hear more about this!",

Where I live there is not many at all which is excellent because I live in quite a large city with a large web3/tech industry. \n\nHas anyone had any success with owning a BTC atm?\n\nThe way how I would do it would be making my own exchange running the exchange through an ATM bought from alibaba and my KYC/AML and licensing  requirements by consulting an attorney. I have the capital for all of this.\n\nI know there is a market where I live, the exchange would put privacy and anonymity first.\n\nI would want to start my exchange only offering BTC and XMR but let me know your thoughts it would be highly appreciated.",

So they cant take effect before block current + 1. That way you can safely send on the chain that is longest, the tx won't replay on the other chains until those reach that block height, too. Time starts ticking then.\n\nIn general is a good idea to split to addresses you control. That way you can't really lose any coins even if replay happens, since you control the keys.",

While he was pretty bad at it back then, it's fair to assume he's gotten much better. \n\nWhich is kinda sad as applied to bsv, because it is pretty obviously a scam coin, so there's no need for such tactics, the facts speak for themselves.

He paid 2.9 million Dollars to buy a digital 'token' that 'represents' a series of words written and published on the internet years ago as a 'tweet'. Right. He doesn't own the rights to the tweet: anybody can read, repeat, print, speak or try to profit from it; he doesn't own anything about the tweet except a token that refers to its existence.\n\n> Its clear that nobody would pay 25 million dollars for a short series of words that are freely available to anyone - here they are: 'Just setting up my twttr'. No, that would be the height of stupidity. So why would anyone pay for or value a digital, arbitrarily assigned 'serial code' that refers to it? The words are not even contained in the NFT. Seems to me that NFTs have no intrinsic value to anyone.\n\nThis guy's argument seems simple and truthful and easy-to-understand but I'm aware those conditions alone can be misleading. Basically, I've never read a stronger \"anti-NFT\" argument on Reddit before in my life and I'm curious what's the rebuttal from someone who is pro-NFT?",

The more I looked into the [technical side](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1BiOcClgDVNESaPA3L7bYw?si=2f42603c53854d12), the less value I perceived. Time and time again I observed people were willing to turn a blind eye to obvious issues in order to generate a sense of hype.\n\nEveryone was willing to believe someone else had figured it out but the closer I came to the emperor's chamber the more I realized that he was [wearing no clothes](https://www.bookbrowse.com/expressions/detail/index.cfm/expression_number/605/the-emperor-has-no-clothes).\n\nA little compromise here, a little blindness there and the great deception is formed.\n\nWhere are the people of integrity?\n\nIf you don't know what I'm talking about I suggest reading:\n\n[The idea that NFTs will allow you to take items between worlds is a pipe dream driven by ignorance. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaverse/comments/tz6520/the_idea_that_nfts_will_allow_you_to_take_items/)\n\nNot only that I have noticed that artificial intelligence is being used here on Reddit to write articles in mass to promote the value of NFTs and crypto. It's the same article over and over and over again with synonyms changed. Then these posts are upvoted by bots creating a fake-news cycle supposedly supported by the masses.\n\nHowever, the [more research I do](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaversestartup/comments/tjc6fk/as_a_gamer_i_would_be_less_inclined_to_play_games/) the less human support I see for this hype cycle.\n\nAre we all just being led along by bots?\n\n# Finally, my question:\n\nI really believe in being objective about things and not just taking a position and being unwilling to change your mind. So I have been talking with industry experts trying to probe and find a way to challenge my own idea of the metaverse.There's one thing that I've been unable to refute concerning a possible value for NFTs, and I came here to see what people think:\n\nIn the past it's been very difficult to track the royalties of art sales. Let's say I create a piece of fine art and I want to give it up in exchange for royalties on its sale to a publisher. I want a transparent way to track this art throughout the web and get my royalties.\n\n# Is there any real, serious, legitimate use case for NFTs?",

Unfortunately maybe 5% of people involved in the space understand this today. \n\nLook at home ownership.  How do you actually \u201cown\u201d the home.  It\u2019s because The State has established laws allowing records to show that you can use that place and stuff to your liking. Where NFTs come in is allowing to own something by replacing the structure the state previously organized. \n\nThe only part missing is the enforcement.  The State can enforce their organization. Right now there is nothing reinforcing NFTs. Ideally coercion will be strictly incentive based but I am watching for the fiat signs of digital enforcement. Like blackballing on the blockchain attached to NFT underlying code.",

            "selftext": "Good news everyone, we recently tested our new bridge between SmartBCH and Binance Smart Chain, we transferred our Swap token Ki from SmartBCH to BSC, with what is a new set of smart contracts. While we initially deployed already available open source code for our Testnet bridge, after long consideration and testing a few other bridges, we decided to design and create our own bridge! On this and an upcoming post I will try to  summarize why we are writing new code, how are things going and what plans we have as we built the basic infrastructure to the **internet of value! We are pursuing this idea of being able to access any token, NFT,  DEFI contract, on any blockchain, with low fees and securely; what we are calling the internet of value.**\n\n# Bitcoin Cash at the center of the bridge.\n\nThe highly scalable properties of Smart Bitcoin Cash, and its low fees create the perfect platform to make it the center of a set of bridges and tools that would allow for value to flow across chains. **We see a future where tokens and NFTS securely move across blockchains with low fees and high security.**  We see how in turn **PoW** based **scarcity** and **usefulness,** are the ultimate value generators for a blockchain coin.  Not all networks are the same, and PoW chains are the only ones we believe can be truly scarce. Consider how relatively easy it is to launch a new PoS chain, yet the same is not true for a PoW chain, energy sets a hard limit and creates real scarcity. Scalable and scarce, Bitcoin Cash is the perfect platform for the internet of value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bitcoin Cash at the center of the Internet of Value](https://preview.redd.it/nuq22i0ptbt81.png?width=336&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d6a9dbc93526c1d7a49098a420c430c214b90ce)\n\n# Federated bridges\n\nWe had previously discussed how a Federated bridge works, if you will like to learn more about them please check our previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/osynga/lets\\_talk\\_about\\_bridges/](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/osynga/lets_talk_about_bridges/)\n\nHere are some popular Federated bridges, they all work very similarly to each other.\n\n\\-[https://bridge.roninchain.com/](https://bridge.roninchain.com/)\\-[https://github.com/ChainSafe/ChainBridge](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ChainBridge)\\-[https://github.com/certusone/wormhole](https://github.com/certusone/wormhole)\\-[https://github.com/rsksmart/tokenbridge](https://github.com/rsksmart/tokenbridge)\\-[https://xbridge.qbt.fi/bridge](https://xbridge.qbt.fi/bridge)\n\nMany of the above bridges suffered recent hacks, the attacks targeted vulnerabilities on their smart contracts code, and API end points. Some of these bridges are trying to do a lot of things, have lots of moving parts and are very complex. In the case of Wormhole, they created not only a bridge but a protocol that allows any message to be relayed across multiple chains, while useful the added complexity may prove to be a mistake. We believe it would be better to focus every design detail on resiliency. Roninchain attack resulted in 600M dollars being lost!\n\nA big disadvantage of federated bridges is that federators need to coordinate their actions.  This proved to be a challenge on our recent work testing RSK bridge and Chainsafe bridge. Not only are they difficult to deploy and maintain, but coordinating work among members of the bridge proved extremely difficult.\n\nMany of these Federator bridges have limited  multi chain support, adding new chains adds complexity. For instance if you wanted to use RSK bridge to support multiple chains, you would end up having to deploy one bridge set for each one of the chains. Then coordinating the work among the different participants of the federation becomes an even more difficult task. A nightmare for any devops, and a security issue for the bridge itself.\n\nFederated bridges  like RSK need several transactions to complete moving a token with minimal security. In this case, even while the platform is configured to always receive 5 out of 5 signatures, the high costs result in that there is always just 3 signatures, the other 2 are out of the picture for real world usage.\n\nWhen things go bad for Federators, an it does happen often, lots of devops work required. This required work adds risks, coordination among the different parties running a Federator is often needed.\n\nThese are just some of the most notorious issues with the current generation of available bridges, there are many more considerations.\n\n# Our solution, \u201cSignatory bridges\u201d.\n\nSignatories based bridges share various of the same ideas that make Federated bridges work, but they simplify the components that make bridging possible .\n\nLets now go over how a token is moved using our new bridge. First the user sends the token into a  multi-signature contract that locks it. Signatories take notice of the deposits, once the deposits gets to a certain level of finality, signatories do their best attempt to make accessible a signed message certifying that a token is locked into the bridge contract.  Unlike Federators voting on the destination chain contract, a Signatory merely signs a message and blindly does its best to write to a website. The Signatory does not have any open ports, it is completely hidden from the internet. Does not communicate to other signatories  or even tries to call functions of any contracts. It works completely independently. It sees a transaction, it signs it when it is certain the transaction won't be rolled back.\n\nMultiple Signatories running independently are signing the same transaction and doing their best to communicate it to the outside world. One or a few failing to do so, does not stop the transaction from being successful.  Our bridge is optimized for resiliency. A user is able to find enough Signatories signed messages corresponding to his deposit and put them together to form a claim.\n\nThe user then switches to the destination network and submits a transaction with the claim to the bridge contract on the other side. If the claim is valid the contract then mints or unlocks the coins/tokens and sends them to the user submitting the claim.\n\nThe way the destination contract knows the claim is valid is by checking the validity of the signatures. The contract stores the public keys of the signatories it trusts so that it can verify that the claim message was in-fact signed by the signatories.\n\nThis simplifies the bridging process a lot; there is no voting meaning lower complexity and much lower costs on the contract. There is no need for Federators paying contracts for each of the votes. Instead of multiple transactions, this signatory method only needs 2. One deposit, one claims. While at the same time maintaining the levels of security of signatories and even improving it. You will notice that it wont make much difference to have a 3 out of 5 signature check scheme, or a 15 out of 20, it would still only be 2 transactions.\n\nSignatories are EXTREMELY simple, small code footprint, well-known cryptography primitives. Closed box, rarely will need an update if ever. Can be deployed in minutes, no open ports and can be kept under a firewall. Set it and forget it. No access to keys by Devops. The Signatory makes use of a docker container with an encrypted file system. Upon its first run internally generates keys and informs of its public key.\n\nNotice how the only thing that the signatories did is they certified a transaction exists and is valid. Signatories did not move any value from one chain to another.  There may a time when laws may need services moving value to report on them.\n\nAnother big upside, adapting the code for non EVM compatible blockchains is extremely easy. Only the claiming contracts need to be rewritten. Imagine the same on a Federators based bridge, they need to support making calls for different types of blockchains. A lot more complex!\n\n# \n\n[Ki is a SmartBCH sep20 token, now available in Binance Smart Chain.](https://preview.redd.it/fip7v3hwxbt81.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=76834c10f68276b3f30c15fb1d40535dc357e0c5)\n\n# Pick only two: Fast, Cheap, Secure?\n\nThis post is already way too long, and we have more to share but will continue on a follow up post starting with an answer to the Pick Two question above.\n\nIf you would like to support the work we are doing, consider switching some of your liquidity and trading to our decentralized exchange at [https://www.koingfu.com](http://www.koingfu.com) , You can also buy some of our recently launched token $Ki , all the work we are doing will be supported by it as we move forward!\n\nYou can also join our Telegram group, the group is only available with this invite link: [https://t.me/+Hi\\_qG5A59IhiZGQx](https://t.me/+Hi_qG5A59IhiZGQx)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

Ethereum was down 8% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 16% drop in THORChain, and a 6% decline in BTC over the same period.\n\nFor now, technical indicators suggest lower support at $37,500 and $40,000 could stabilize BTC's down move. And if the support does its job and provides the market with a bounce up, fundamentally sound tokens will be the quickest to recover. Plastiks, a project that lets companies tokenize their plastic recovery data for monetization and proof of sustainability; Avalanche, a competitor to Ethereum that prioritizes scalability and transaction processing speed; and Terra, a decentralized blockchain payment platform for stablecoins, may witness significant market capitalization growth when the major cryptos bounce back.\n\nHowever, for now, it appears that investors have tightened their risk budget, which is typical during times of market turbulence.

Satoshi in their writings spoke about central banks debasing the currency.\n\nBut of course this is unworkable if you can't make it into a widely used currency i.e. real money.\n\nBTC was crippled in capacity and then a \"store of value\" narrative was built up, but the ones doing that _know very well_ that it cannot remain a store of value if it's only useful for speculation, esp. since they can print USD (and fake digital USD) to their heart's content and people will mostly just FOMO into a bubbled up BTC whose speculative markets they can control very well through this kind of digital fiat.\n\nBut does anyone remember how much of a threat Bitcoin was said to pose to governments and financial institutions before it was 'tamed' ?\n\nWhy was it a threat?\n\nBecause it _can_ be a hedge against inflation if many people across the world adopt it as a currency.\n\nBut for that, it needs to a wide medium of exchange, to solidify its value and slowly become a real store of value used by great masses of people, not just a few.\n\nThat's why Bitcoin Cash matters a lot because it is still pursuing that goal via the first step - adoption as working currency.\n\n---\n\nTL;DR I get a bit upset when longtime Bitcoin Core supporters now try to tear down the same 'store of value' narrative which they helped build up in the first place.  This reeks too much of continued controlled demolition of Bitcoin to sit right with me. Not saying this is Udi, but it's popular now in the mainstream, egged on by legacy finance, to poo-poo Bitcoin's (and I don't mean just BTC) value proposition of eliminating central bank debasement of money. I expect this trend to intensify as fiat inflation becomes rampant all round, because if people actually went to Bitcoin (Cash) and other fixed supply monies and started using them as currency, the rapacious banksters would be one step closer to extinction.",

                    "response": "It comes from demand to hold. How many people, and how much value each of them want to hold in that money type.\n\nIt does not mean hold forever, it can be from seconds to generations. It depends on each individual's situation and preferences.\n\nTransactions, or use in trade, does not mean anything directly for the value. The important thing is that you can easily get rid of your money when you want - how liquid the money is.\n\nHodling means you want to have a considerable fraction of your total money holding in bitcoin (BTC, BCH), always rebalance your holdings when practical circumstances change those balances. Since the liquidity is not the best for BCH, compared to fiat money, given that you will need fiat money in the near future, you always need to have some fiat money. All shops basically want to buy your fiat money.\n\nSo if you plan to buy a big item, like a car, you have to, in advance, rebalance your money types so you have the fiat necessary. After that trade, you have to consider how much money you have left in total, which type you want to hold, and rebalance.\n\nAll money types (including dollars and local fiat) have value only because you believe that it will keep the value, or at least some of it, in the future. That is obvious, because they are not real, you have to sell the money to get what you need. The only purpose of having money, any type, is to sell in the future.\n\nNow, what is the future for your local fiat? The dollar? Bitcoin Cash? You have to make an opinion. \n\nFor me, it is easy based on my knowlegde, all fiat money are guaranteed to go down in value, that is inherent in how the central banks and the governments function. BCH on the other hand, can increase in value. That I like, I don't want to buy something to show off, spend my monthly salary the same day I get it. So I have most of my money in BCH, just a small amount in local fiat and dollar.\n\n\nWhy can BTC and BCH increase in value? Because people will find out eventually that their money loses value to the tune of 15% a year. First they will spend on big ticket items, because they figure out that they will at least get something for it. But luxury cars for instance is not good money, and not stable. Argentinians experience that in their most recent hyperinflation. Not too many people wanted those cars, and they don't last forever. So they will turn to sound money crypto, meaning the demand goes up, the available amount does not go up at all, the people who want to sell will not increase enough to satisfy the new demand, and the coin price goes up. \n\nIn the end it will stabilize, but not completely, we can still get increase in the value of money in the form of real stuff slowly going down in value, due to productivity increase and other factors.\n\nNone of this will happen unless the money type is spread throughout the world, to almost everybody. Therefore we need the easy use, the speed, the safety, in addition to the soundness. That also means more transactions, but the main thing is that they want to own.",

But my question is would this be enough to have a fully decentralized network if Bitcoin Cash starts to become used by millions of people every day?\n\nIf we see what's happening in St. Marteen there are over 70k people on that island, that could easily lead to 70k - 400k transactions a day. Which is easy to scale, but what if countries like lebanon who has a population of 6.8 million people? That could be 7 to 21 million transactions a day which could lead to several gigabytes being added to the chain daily. \n\nWe all see what's going on with BSV, they have a chain of 4 TB but only 12 nodes running the network.",

That would equal to roughly 3GB added daily. A little under 1TB added per year. Your $260 10TB harddisk would obviously handle that no problem.\n\n>We all see what's going on with BSV, they have a chain of 4 TB but only 12 nodes running the network.\n\nAre you really implying that the reason BSV has only 14 nodes is because of its 4TB chain size?

As computers themselves also get faster and storage cheaper, this number will go up even without much of a change to the software.\n\nSee here how we expect scaling to happen in the next years. https://flowee.org/news/2020-10-scaling-bitcoin-cash/",

And any changes to it are heresy.\n\nFlash forward 40 years, and think about how terrible DOS is by today's standards. It's practically useless today. A non-graphical, 16-bit, ancient OS can't even do even simple things now. Yeah, it was able to survive for some time, the first few versions of windows even ran off of it. But eventually, it couldn't keep up, even despite everything that was built off of it, the code optimizations, etc. Despite all this, you *still* think that DOS is just the best, and are stuck in the past.\n\nThe attitude of BTC users is exactly like this DOS-lover. It has only been barely a decade at this point, and BTC is already floundering with bandaid-solutions like SegWit, LN, inflated fees, etc. DOS was still plenty usable as a daily OS after a decade, so BTC is already behind.

It is certainly not \"MASSIVELY\" inflationary. Furthermore, the rate is dropping. At the next halving, the rate will be less than 1%. The usage makes no difference because the additional bitcoins dilute the entire supply.\n\nIf you measure inflation by the change in value, then Bitcoin has been massively *de*flationary.",

This is the first campaign that has been published using these new improvements.  This campaign serves a dual-purpose (well, \"triple\" purpose):\n\n1. to prove the updates we've made work \"in the wild\"\n2. to fund maintenance work for Bitcoin Verde\n3. to prove there never was a funding problem\n\nThe 3rd point here is a callback to the days of the IFP.  A large claim was that people would not fund maintenance.  This is just another opportunity to prove that criticism wrong, and that BCH does not have a funding problem and its current incentive model works just fine.  We didn't need the IFP then, and we don't need it now.\n\nPlease give us feedback on the new user experience, especially if there are any bugs or problems.  Thanks again for everyone's support.",

Who knows maybe some backdoor government deal took place? I don't particularly get it because anyone who just held Bitcoin would benefit from mass adoption which would be much easier if it was actually cheap to use it for common goods. If the transaction fees were like 5 cents you would have the ability to disrupt Visa, venmo, all of that.

The lightning *network* is created by connecting of all these channels to each other, for example if Alice has a channel with Bob, and Bob also has a channel with Carol, then Alice can indirectly pay Carol through Bob. So in theory you have this vast, decentralized network of channels which can operate as a quicker & cheaper alternative to on-chain transactions, and helps to relive some traffic from the blockchain.\n\nBut in practice, the vast majority of channels and liquidity are controlled by a small minority of \"hub\" nodes, and it's only becoming *more* centralized over time. It's simply not realistic to expect most users to have enough channels and provide enough liquidity to effectively route other peoples' transactions. Plus, you need a 24/7 lightning node running to do so in the first place. Most people don't even bother with any channels at all, they simply use a centralized wallet provider to handle it for them.\n\nIt also doesn't help that LN is inherently unscalable, so these centralized hubs and/or watchtowers will always become harder to avoid over time as adoption grows. The long-term outlook is that LN will become highly centralized and censorable, which is unfortunate because in theory it's actually a really cool and clever idea.",

It's the store of value property of the bitcoin that seems to require it.If bitcoin's primary function is a Store of Value (SOV), then it's foolish to use or spend it, for transactions. Especially since it has a high cost to acquire it -- converting USD to it, moving it to a secure \"wallet\", etc. Therefore, I am not sure if bitcoin has any use for regular transactions and that its either a SOV or its nothing. And if SOV, since it doesn't earn any fees but has very high costs to maintain the network and would this require it to continually increase in value and faster than other assets for the premise to be valid.\n\nAlso then another issue is that -- the cost to secure the bitcoin value and the network -- should be directly correlated to its value or i.e. the higher the value, then the higher the cost to maintain it and if this doesn't come from transaction fees, then it needs to come from the ever expectation of price increase.   \nIt's an interesting dynamic. As the Bitcoin mining coin rewards decrease over time, it'll need to be sustained by transaction fees only, but if people don't use it for transactions, that's also problematic.",

However, a couple of weeks ago SLP tokens became 'Temporarily Disabled' and now they have been removed from it completely.\n\nI still hold some flexUSD for the interest the wallet provide, which I had recently converted from SEP20 token to SLP of about $10 (Don't laugh, I am poor. Ok) just for the sake of it all. I have got about 0.5% back in 1 month as interest for now.\n\nNow, apart from CoinFlex exchange I don't have any other way to change my SLP token to either mainnet BCH or SEP20 token.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile this is all for fun and games I still wonder would SLP tokens still exist in the time to come?\n\nSuppose if my $10 in flexUSD becomes $11  from interest would I still be about to use it?",

            "selftext": "Bitcoin Cash saved our Condo.\n\nI have always wanted to report this story but delayed till our security upgrades were completed.\n\nLate 2020, I decided to buy a condo in Kenya. I found a nice place in a gated community with private water, backup power generators, patrolled by armed guards (who work for us and are always polite - unlike police). Despite choosing the penthouse on the top floor, the price was only $120K. In America, this would easily be over a $million.\n\nI sold some crypto and had the money moved to my USA bank account. That is when the problems started. My USA bank wanted me to come in and sign paperwork to wire the money to my bank overseas despite no air flights out due to Covid at this time. This wasn't a problem with ID as the manager knew me well, but this bank was always very stringent about the rules. This never bothered me as they were very crypto friendly though and even now I still have a good relationship with them. They just weren't willing to send the money without me appearing in person to sign the paperwork.\n\nSo I came up with a new strategy. I had two other backup bank accounts and could easily transfer from this bank to them. I also had a PayPal card. I would just transfer money to each of them and then use my ATM cards to withdraw, then immediately deposit in my local bank. While a logistical pain to go to the mall every day, I figured I could transfer $2000 a day this way and have the money transferred in just two months.\n\nTurns out this doesn't work. My bank had a $10K monthly limit on local transfers. This includes transfers to Paypal. So basically I was stuck with just removing $10K plus $10k per month via ATM cards. At this rate it would have taken over six months.\n\nI tried making a large transfer using Western Union, but that just resulted in my account being frozen for three months till they just randomly removed the freeze. I also tried depositing a check at my Kenyan bank, but they refused it.\n\nAt this point, I decided to use bitcoin (BTC) via Bitpesa. I had an old account from 2014 with them and even had personal contact information with people that worked there. I knew they didn't do the Bitcoin->Mpesa thing anymore, but thought I could work something out. Turns out, despite being located in Kenya, they can't do any exchanges in Kenya anymore.\n\nAt this point, I tried \"local dot bitcoin dot com\" using Bitcoin Cash. I started out with small amounts using the top buyers. Each transfer went smoothly. Eventually working up to the $1500 per transfer limit. Mpesa has a limit of around $3000/day, but with two accounts that makes $6000/day. You can transfer from Mpesa to a Kenya bank account directly on your phone, so you don't even have to leave home. Anyway, we had the rest of the money to buy our condo in just a few weeks.\n\nTLDR: Fiat completely failed, Bitcoin completely failed, Bitcoin Cash worked.\n\nUpdate: The site URL was changed to \"Localcryptos dot com\" since I did my BCH->Fiat swaps.",

This gave significant economic power to bitcoiners who where bought into the digital gold narrative. And they sold vast majority of it in the public market. I believe most of it has moved to long term holders by now.\n2. Traders on the buy side of BCH got punished by this supply shock several times. And they are hesitant to get back in.\n3. At this point BCH has a lot less visibility in the well known news outlets. Like Coindesk and CNBC\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe good things I can see right now.\n\n1. BCH whales are continuing to support the project, It is less visible now days since it is mostly happening on the background. Examples are smartBCH, coinflex as a competitor to binance and bitcoin.com\n2. Grayscale bitcoin cash trust's discount ratio has significantly reduced in this month. I believe DCG is buying BCH on discount. Most likely they have sold significant of their BCH holdings in the past two years. And when the hype gets back in BCH. They have no choice but to increase back their exposure. Which they are partly doing on GBCH trust. DCG has announced they are buying $350M worth of grayscale products. Some of it is for BCH.\n3. And so many short term investors have left BCH already. That is opportunity for new investors coming into crypto.",

And they are doing this by shifting focus on their son of a bitch coin BTC, ETH and other shitcoins so that the real deal will lose energy! They're are very successful at it thanks to the spineless idiots joining the crypto space everyday and diverting attention to total shitcoins! If the good wins in the end BCH s victory will be glorious. If not crypto was a good chance for humanity but we screwed it.\n\nBCH s failure is Bitcoins failure and it means if we lose we  have lost once again and may be forever!",

In my opinion the only reason this has gotten a resurgence of interest is because governments want to use it to entice people to sign up for central bank digital currencies.\n\nAnyway, the concept of money being distributed to everyone always raises the question of who is the altruistic one giving that money away. And this question tends to be ignored. Some people assume it will come from taxation. Which is interesting as that is essentially reintroducing Robin Hood. Steal from the rich to give to the poor. Sure, you give equally to the rich, but its their own money you are giving back.\n\nEven in communism people were obligated to work, so this idea that people could simply get paid enough to live without giving a single dime back to society is going to fail even faster and harder than communism did.\n\nThe economics just don't make sense. Nobody answered the question of who will fund everyone, including slackers.",

Every step forward is a turning of a one way ratchet that ultimately leads to some crypto becoming [*Permissionless P2P Money For The World*](https://youtu.be/9mBc0Zk1YWs?t=148) assuming it is possible. u/chaintip\n\n\n>> **Ren\u00e9 Pickhardt:** we were very afraid to publish the results because in earlier days there was always this criticism coming from the Bitcoin Cash community that lightning routing is like an unsolved problem and if it would be solved it would be NP complete. **Now it turns out that with the current goal that nodes have to optimise for just the fees the problem actually is NP Complete and we were very afraid to actually publish this because we we thought we would get a lot of ridicule from this community but that community didn't care at all** [link](https://youtu.be/TAgBDwQqVjs?t=1364)\n\n\nWe did care, he just wasn't Trolled over it.\n\n\n\n> We may disagree on the best cryptocurrency projects but I've always respected Rene. The guy is a solid engineer that pours his passion into working on lightning **and is honest about the pros and cons of the technology.**\n\n\nBTC Maxi's regularly come here and say we are dishonest and BCH is a scam ignoring the fact that BTC is sold as a means for financial freedom for the whole world and yet the principle architects of BTC/LN agree that a 1MB (non witness) chain will be custodial (the common man will be asking for permission to spend their coins)\n\n\nBitcoin Core's premier coder\n\n\n>>  **Pieter Wuille:** But I don't think that goal should be, **or can realistically be**, everyone simultaneously having on-chain funds.[link](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1186730172902301696)\n\n\n\n\nTadge Dryja - Co Author of the Lightning Network White Paper to Peter McCormack April 2019\n\n\n>> In the future if you have these 1 megabyte or whatever restricted block size and lightning Network it's still rich people and companies can all use lightning but the average user probably can't [source](https://youtu.be/LnG5H62I7Ko?t=1018)\n\n\nI thought the whole *raison d'\u00eatre* of the LN was low fees, because L1 fees would become exorbitant.\n\n\n\nOne of the reasons I support BCH is the will to scale on chain and an evidence based approach to achieving it, now contrast that with Rene's critique of Jack Mallers or Tadge Dryja regarding his co author Joseph Poon (Co-Authors of the LN White Paper)\n\n\n>> **Tadge Dryja:** that was a source of sort of tension when **Joseph would say this can scale to billions of transactions a second I'm like dude come on no it can't where are you getting that number** and it's like maybe you could come up with ideas where it does but it's just doesn't seem realistic so **I would never want to pitch lightning as oh this will scale you know this solves everything** [source](https://youtu.be/LnG5H62I7Ko?t=987)",

We dont have huge central banks like most countries, we don't have huge stock markets and economies that are indirectly tied to the value of currencies. Many of us peg our local currencies to the US Dollar which in itself is dangerous. So pure speculation? Yeah in the very long term I see crypto becoming the largest form of tender in the Caribbean.\n\nWhat i find appealing? It's fast and cheap and does not require the banking industry to determine who can have wealth and who can't. In St. Maarten especially, this has been the case. The banking sector has single handedly stunted the growth of my people with ridiculous 7%+ interest rates, months time to open accounts, and unilaterally closing people's bank accounts. It is my distaste for the way the banking sector has treated the people of my country that has pushed me to explore crypto.",

In SXM if I want to split a bill with a buddy and send him $10, using my bank it may take days for him to receive it. Or if i want to send money abroad to a family member, I may need to stand in line for hours at western union to send a limited amount. Instant payments help us.\n2. SXM depends 90% on tourism in terms of GDP. So if we can have a bump in tourism as  a result of being a more \"crypto friendly\" destination, that is something I surely welcome. We have a residency by investment program which can apply, but also American citizens get automatic residence in St Maarten.",

There is not enough adoption here to survive without fiat, not enough people paying with crypto to stop accepting fiat as payment, and the regulation on crypto here is favoured towards investors, not peer to peer cash, so it makes record keeping and accounting very complicated for merchants, luckily it can be mostly automated.\n\nSounds good. What kind of investment value are we talking about here, and what exactly would it be invested in, is this is a one off payment? How long can a UK resident stay without permanent residency? What are the restrictions on this? Can they work if needed?\n\nI am an online merchant who accepts crypto as well as fiat since 2011.",

Our legal system is Dutch so we have to translate, then it has to be vetted by different advisory bodies, after which It goes to Parliament for approval. I would hope we could get his done before the end of this year though.\n4. Reaction is mixed, but its what I expected. Some are vehemently applauding, some are concerned. But whats important to me is that, for the first time ever, there is a public discussion on Crypto. Sometimes leaders say and do things to get he community's flowing, discussing, debating.

Anyone can research, read and look into Crypto, as they should, but when one of your leaders takes the step himself, it encourages more people to research read and look into crypto.  \n\n\nRegarding your question: Yes I have, and it was Bitcoin. To answer this, I need to give you some background on what lead me to seeking solutions for p2p transactions:  \n\n\n**Background story here:**\n\nWhen I was elected in 2017, one of my major concerns was our banking difficulties in St. Maarten, which also is the case in many latin american and caribbean countries. So I started doing my own research into Bitcoin being the most popular coin of course. I learned quickly that, at least at that time, it was not a practical solution and/or alternative to banking for my people. We needed something cheap, fast, easy. Then it got difficult. Because navigating the hundreds of options out there became difficult. \n\nMeantime the Banking in St. Maarten sucked, and still does to a great extent: Takes months to open accounts sometimes. KYC is a nightmare. On small islands EVERYONE is treated like  pep, because everyone is related to one. Transactions between banks takes days. Fees are really high. Paypal, cashapp and other things dont work here.  \n\n\nSo i shifted my focus back to banking sector reform, which has had some success:\n\n[https://sxmgovernment.com/2019/11/25/mp-brison-to-submit-consumer-banking-protection-law-this-week/](https://sxmgovernment.com/2019/11/25/mp-brison-to-submit-consumer-banking-protection-law-this-week/) \n\nthen the Motion passing the vetting of the law\n\n[https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/brison-tables-five-draft-motions-in-parliament](https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/brison-tables-five-draft-motions-in-parliament)\n\nand then most recently it started being implemented\n\n[https://www.sxm-talks.com/st-martin-news-network/brison-sees-partial-voluntary-implementation-of-the-consumer-banking-law-a-good-first-step/](https://www.sxm-talks.com/st-martin-news-network/brison-sees-partial-voluntary-implementation-of-the-consumer-banking-law-a-good-first-step/)  \n\n\nSimultaneously while working on all the above, I was researching and seeking our alternative cryptocurrency, which I believe would also put pressure on the banks to do better.\n\nIn the meantime, I learned about bitcoin cash. Since then I kept researching it, and then saw merchants on my island and other islands using it and figured I may have found a coin that works. \n\n**TL;DR on background:** banking REALLY sucks in St. Maarten, and while trying to fix that sector, I was also seeking an alternative. \n\nSo back to your question: after experimenting with Bitcoin, seeing its potential adoption on El Salvador, I knew it was not the solution on the P2P end of things. BCH fit that more which is why so many merchants are adopting it on their own.",

                    "response": "**Benefits of Bitcoin Cash for Everyone**\n\n- For the first time in human history, Bitcoin Cash allows you to be in full control of your own money. Bitcoin Cash is peer to peer money that cannot be frozen by the banks nor the government.\n\n- With Bitcoin Cash, you place your trust in the laws of Math and Cryptography rather than putting your trust in people.\n\n- Send or receive any amount of Bitcoin Cash, to anyone, anywhere, instantly and almost for free. No lengthy bank forms to fill in and no private information required from both the sender and recipient.\n\n- Whenever you are frustrated with the long queues in the bank to make a transaction, imagine how much time you had wasted, and how many millions other people are wasting their time in the bank queues every single day. Bitcoin Cash saves time and money for millions of people every single day.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash helps to connect the billions of unbanked people, with valuable talents and expertise, to the global economy, creating millions of new job opportunities and increasing economic growth for the entire world.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash enables micro transactions so you can write articles or create video contents and earn money immediately by people who like your work.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash has high volatility which could be seen as an issue or an opportunity, depending on your perspective. If something is $1 today and 20 years later, it is still $1, then there is no investment opportunity.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash protects your purchasing power from inflation and hyperinflation, similar to gold and silver, because it exists outside the banking system of fiat money.\n\n- Unlike fiat money, Bitcoin Cash cannot be counterfeited, so there is zero chance of you holding fake money.\n\n- New bank regulations with regards to bail-ins and bail-outs means the banks can confiscate depositors funds legally and anytime during a financial crisis and there is no recourse for you.\n\n- Banks can shut down and disappear along with the depositors money but Bitcoin Cash has a perfect track record of being online 24 hours a day, every single day, and had been doing so since 2009.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash payments, with CashShuffle and CashFusion, are private Internet money. This means you can send/receive money with anyone privately without having to give out your private information, useful in situations when you want to donate money to an organization without risk being implicated in the process.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is an insurance against corrupted governments. Given a long enough time, eventually a group of corrupted politicians will win the election and take control over the country to enrich themselves. Bitcoin Cash gives you the freedom to move your wealth anywhere and relocate anytime to a safer haven.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash allows you to bypass financial censorships, restrictions and sanctions because it is unstoppable peer to peer money.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today.\n\n- If you were aware of the protests currently going on in Hong Kong, India, Iran, Chile, Bolivia, and other countries, you have to wonder how a minority government could suppress and control millions of citizens.\n\nTurns out if you have an unlimited money printing machine, you could control the entire nation. You could use it to pay for the police and military to beat up the civilians. You could use it to bribe the politicians to look the other way. You could use it to pay for propaganda campaigns. You could use it to invest in companies to prevent them from speaking up.\n\nWhen you remove their unlimited money printing machine, you also reduce their ability to suppress and control the people. Suddenly, the power shifts back into the people\u2019s hands because nobody can print more Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash\u2019s supply is fixed and there will only be 21 million Bitcoin Cash forever.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is programmable money which allows for smart contracts, tokens, oracles, dividends, anonymous bearer shares, and so much new innovations that wasn\u2019t possible before. It is like the very early periods of the Internet age where it is a rapidly evolving technology and crazy amount of new innovations happen regularly and yet people barely know anything about the Internet at that point.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Benefits of Bitcoin Cash for Merchants**\n\n- Bitcoin Cash transactions are instant and safe.\n\n- Risk of chargebacks is nearly zero.\n\n- No more worries about credit card frauds.\n\n- No more worries about centralized payment systems such as PayPal freezing or stealing your money like what had happened to thousands of PayPal users.\n\n- No payment processing fee. As a merchant, you receive 100% of the amount paid to you by the customer.\n\n- Super easy to get started. Just install the Bitcoin.com Wallet and the Bitcoin Cash Register App and you can start accepting Bitcoin Cash payments within minutes.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash does not stigmatize or treat any businesses differently. If you run an organization that banks or governments may not like, you risk having your funds being confiscated anytime like what happened to the funds donated to help Hong Kong Protestors. Bitcoin Cash cannot be taken away by the banks nor the government without your permission.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How You Can Help This Peer To Peer Cash Revolution**\n\n- Spend Bitcoin Cash whenever possible. You can buy anything with Bitcoin Cash on Amazon today with up to 30% using the Purse.io service. You can pay for air tickets, hotels, food and other services using Bitcoin Cash today. Visit AcceptBitcoin.Cash or Map.Bitcoin.com to look for participating merchants today!\n\n- Pay your employees in Bitcoin Cash to help build a closed loop economy. Request to be paid in Bitcoin Cash if you\u2019re the employee.\n\n- Help educate and spread the benefits of Bitcoin Cash to family and friends, or you can just direct them to this page!\n\n- Make small donations to open source developers contributing their free time voluntarily to build applications and services for the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.\n\n- Everytime someone tries to sell you something, ask them if they accept Bitcoin Cash.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSource: https://slp.1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame",

That is how the inflation protection can come about.\n\nAlso, we know that increased demand to hold, an effect of adoption, means higher coin value. Together, this makes up an interesting mix of advantages: Easy transactions, no intrusion from a third party or government in your payment, inflation protection and a high reward expectation - low risk from a savers point of view.\n\nRemember the first user (satoshi) in the beginning had no counterparty to receive payment from and the coin had no value... and the first years normal payment for goods and services was not really an option. The expectation of future uptake was therefore the only aspect, and currently it is still an important aspect if not the most important aspect. Throwing that under the bus, marketing wise, is therefore the wrong thing to do.\n\nTo da moon!",

I am sure that got some new investors jump in and bought a lot of Bitcoin when it was just a fake hype and fake news spread by some scammer to hype up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd then I see some other altcoins that are obviously rug pulls but new investors keep on buying because they believe in the fake news and fake promises (fake \u201cpartnerships\u201d with big companies). That\u2019s how it usually goes with crypto market in general. The price is driven by the hype of the false promises and partnerships. The promise that brings in a lot of money from suckers like me.\n\nDon\u2019t get wrong though. I think some crypto coins are legitimate like Bitcoin Cash that just works without fake news or false promises. Bitcoin Core (BTC) on the other hand makes a lot of promises but it\u2019s still too slow and the fee is too high to be practical for normal people to use. \n\nThe whole thing with El Salvador was just a big fake news that didn\u2019t really work. The only true thing about BTC is that billionaires like Michael Saylor are buying it because of the false promise that the price will keep going up forever.\n\nI think such mentality is that of a cultist and it\u2019s time that some of us wake up and realize that most of the hype in crypto market is just a scam.",

There was no hashwar, the decision was made by a handful of prominent exchanges.\n\n>  A hard fork refers to a significant change in a blockchain network. \n\nNo.  A hard fork refers to an expansion of the Bitcoin rules such that some blocks that would have been considered invalid under the old system are now considered valid.  In fact the soft fork upgrade (Segwit) was a vastly more significant change to the blockchain than the hard fork BCH upgrade.\n\n> It is a radical update that splits a cryptocurrency into two. \n\nNo.  Hard forks do not necessarily split the currency into two.  BCH has had several hard fork upgrades, these did not split the chain.\n\n> After the split, one cryptocurrency follows the protocols of the old blockchain, and the other follows a new set of protocols. \n\nNo blockchain in existence currently follows the protocols of the old blockchain.  The protocols of the old blockchain ended in 2017 and are no longer followed by miners, though some old derelict clients may follow along due to an exploit that keeps them on the chain (the old derelict clients are fed a blockchain that is stripped of its signatures and which the old client cannot validate, but treats as valid anyway).",

Since I had looked through more than a couple hundreds of these account history, I thought I might share some things I observed in the course of my work.\n\nThese are not AI bots, but most likely cheap labor from India. Here are the main reasons why I think so.\n\n1) Once a while, I found them writing comments in Hindi.\n\n2) AI is very unlikely to have the ability to differentiate normal threads from honeypot threads https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ss0llj/important_please_do_not_comment_in_this_thread/\n\nHowever, anyone with basic English reading ability will be able to avoid it. That honeypot thread was not able to trick the \"bots\".\n\n3) It explains the poor and broken English of these bots.\n\n4) It explains how they were able to write comments with some relevance to the thread, even if the thread is only a link or an image.\n\n*Something interesting I noted is that many of the bots are only active in r/btc. I don't know why but that's my observations.\n\nSo then it begs the question, why are they doing this? I have some theories.\n\n- These companies sell upvoting/downvoting services which you can buy online.\n\n- These companies sell reddit accounts after harvesting sufficient karma.\n\n- Someone is paying them to disrupt this community and undermine the efforts of Bitcoin Cash.\n\n> Over the past few days someone has been running campaigns on microworkers(dot)com to pay people to upvote specific posts on /r/btc and /r/cryptocurrency.\n\n> Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ejl25s/rbtc_is_being_targeted_and_attacked_yet_again/\n\nIn any case, having removed some of these accounts, it may reduced their impact to do vote brigading at least in this subreddit.",

                    "response": "**Benefits of Bitcoin Cash for Everyone**\n\n- For the first time in human history, Bitcoin Cash allows you to be in full control of your own money. Bitcoin Cash is peer to peer money that cannot be frozen by the banks nor the government.\n\n- With Bitcoin Cash, you place your trust in the laws of Math and Cryptography rather than putting your trust in people.\n\n- Send or receive any amount of Bitcoin Cash, to anyone, anywhere, instantly and almost for free. No lengthy bank forms to fill in and no private information required from both the sender and recipient.\n\n- Whenever you are frustrated with the long queues in the bank to make a transaction, imagine how much time you had wasted, and how many millions other people are wasting their time in the bank queues every single day. Bitcoin Cash saves time and money for millions of people every single day.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash helps to connect the billions of unbanked people, with valuable talents and expertise, to the global economy, creating millions of new job opportunities and increasing economic growth for the entire world.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash enables micro transactions so you can write articles or create video contents and earn money immediately by people who like your work.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash has high volatility which could be seen as an issue or an opportunity, depending on your perspective. If something is $1 today and 20 years later, it is still $1, then there is no investment opportunity.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash protects your purchasing power from inflation and hyperinflation, similar to gold and silver, because it exists outside the banking system of fiat money.\n\n- Unlike fiat money, Bitcoin Cash cannot be counterfeited, so there is zero chance of you holding fake money.\n\n- New bank regulations with regards to bail-ins and bail-outs means the banks can confiscate depositors funds legally and anytime during a financial crisis and there is no recourse for you.\n\n- Banks can shut down and disappear along with the depositors money but Bitcoin Cash has a perfect track record of being online 24 hours a day, every single day, and had been doing so since 2009.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash payments, with CashShuffle and CashFusion, are private Internet money. This means you can send/receive money with anyone privately without having to give out your private information, useful in situations when you want to donate money to an organization without risk being implicated in the process.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is an insurance against corrupted governments. Given a long enough time, eventually a group of corrupted politicians will win the election and take control over the country to enrich themselves. Bitcoin Cash gives you the freedom to move your wealth anywhere and relocate anytime to a safer haven.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash allows you to bypass financial censorships, restrictions and sanctions because it is unstoppable peer to peer money.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today.\n\n- If you were aware of the protests currently going on in Hong Kong, India, Iran, Chile, Bolivia, and other countries, you have to wonder how a minority government could suppress and control millions of citizens.\n\nTurns out if you have an unlimited money printing machine, you could control the entire nation. You could use it to pay for the police and military to beat up the civilians. You could use it to bribe the politicians to look the other way. You could use it to pay for propaganda campaigns. You could use it to invest in companies to prevent them from speaking up.\n\nWhen you remove their unlimited money printing machine, you also reduce their ability to suppress and control the people. Suddenly, the power shifts back into the people\u2019s hands because nobody can print more Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash\u2019s supply is fixed and there will only be 21 million Bitcoin Cash forever.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is programmable money which allows for smart contracts, tokens, oracles, dividends, anonymous bearer shares, and so much new innovations that wasn\u2019t possible before. It is like the very early periods of the Internet age where it is a rapidly evolving technology and crazy amount of new innovations happen regularly and yet people barely know anything about the Internet at that point.\n\n**Benefits of Bitcoin Cash for Merchants**\n\n- Bitcoin Cash transactions are instant and safe.\n\n- Risk of chargebacks is nearly zero.\n\n- No more worries about credit card frauds.\n\n- No more worries about centralized payment systems such as PayPal freezing or stealing your money like what had happened to thousands of PayPal users.\n\n- No payment processing fee. As a merchant, you receive 100% of the amount paid to you by the customer.\n\n- Super easy to get started. Just install the Bitcoin.com Wallet and the Bitcoin Cash Register App and you can start accepting Bitcoin Cash payments within minutes.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash does not stigmatize or treat any businesses differently. If you run an organization that banks or governments may not like, you risk having your funds being confiscated anytime like what happened to the funds donated to help Hong Kong Protestors. Bitcoin Cash cannot be taken away by the banks nor the government without your permission.\n\n**How You Can Help This Peer To Peer Cash Revolution**\n\n- Spend Bitcoin Cash whenever possible. You can buy anything with Bitcoin Cash on Amazon today with up to 30% using the Purse.io service. You can pay for air tickets, hotels, food and other services using Bitcoin Cash today. Visit AcceptBitcoin.Cash or Map.Bitcoin.com to look for participating merchants today!\n\n- Pay your employees in Bitcoin Cash to help build a closed loop economy. Request to be paid in Bitcoin Cash if you\u2019re the employee.\n\n- Help educate and spread the benefits of Bitcoin Cash to family and friends, or you can just direct them to this page!\n\n- Make small donations to open source developers contributing their free time voluntarily to build applications and services for the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.\n\n- Everytime someone tries to sell you something, ask them if they accept Bitcoin Cash.\n\nSource: https://slp.1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame",

                    "response": "What attracts me to BCH, aside from being Proof of Work, low fee and usable as cash is the fact that it truly is the real Bitcoin. No ulterior motives to enrich its founders, ICO money grab or some slick website telling you how all these great minds are working on this latest and greatest smart contract project that you should definitely get involved in because it\u2019s about to take off! None of that, just decentralized, permission less, low fee P2P cash for everyone.\n\nNow there are some coins that come very close, but BCH has one big advantage and that is on the developer side. Since it is the real Bitcoin, most documentation, the actual white paper for example, and code written before 2017 can be used pretty much as is (e.g. RPC libraries, wallet code etc.). There\u2019s also a plethora of wallets/node implementations available for multiple operating systems/architectures. As an average developer it\u2019s the easiest way to add a decentralized low fee payment system to your project.",

Are there any coins that have the simple learning curve and ease of use that BCH does?\n\n1. Download bitcoin.com wallet\n2. Show qr code\n3. Someone scans your code\n4. Instantly, your phone dings and you have received BCH\n5. You now scan someone else's qr code and you can instantly send your newly acquired BCH. The confirmations occur in the background and for practical purposes, there is no need to worry about the confirmations. \n\nNo mempool watching, no spinning up lightning network nodes, no difficulty trying to figure out how to get your crypto off of a trapped second layer chain, no waiting hours or days for a confirmation, etc. It is all seamless and instant. It gives a feeling as if you are using PayPal without the potential control/censorship and with all the benefits of a sound money.",

Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.  \n>  \n>What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.",

We are an event-focussed marketing agency with deep crypto knowledge and a long history in supporting Bitcoin Cash projects. Our team also took part in establishing Bitcoin Cash\u2019s industry-leading meetup network which still persists today.\n\nWe host regular in-person blockchain events in London. Join our community to check out some past and upcoming events\u00a0[here](https://www.meetup.com/coinriot/?utm_source=articles&utm_medium=readcash&utm_campaign=meetup).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Are there any sponsors? Also, are you open for more sponsorship?**\n\nWe\u2019ve some amazing sponsors for this event. Few of them are\u00a0[Satoshi\u2019s Angels](https://www.satoshisangels.com/),\u00a0[BenSwap](https://benswap.cash/),\u00a0[The Bitcoin Cash Podcast](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/), and more to be announced soon.\n\nYes, we are currently accepting few more sponsorships, reach out to our team for more information at\u00a0[hello@coinriot.org](mailto:hello@coinriot.org).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What happens after the hackathon ends?**\n\nWe hope that many of the teams and projects continue to be built upon and add significant value to the BCH ecosystem. You never know, perhaps they could find investment or even run their own flipstarter campaigns to expand them.\n\nGot more questions? Type them in below!",

These will bring significantly more advanced programmability to Bitcoin Cash transactions and unlock incredible new potential.\n\n## Main Changes in 1.10.0\n\nThis is list of the main changes that have been merged in this release:\n\n* CHIP-2021-03: [Bigger Script Integers](https://gitlab.com/GeneralProtocols/research/chips/-/blob/master/CHIP-2021-02-Bigger-Script-Integers.md) increased precision for arithmetic operations (see [discussion](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/chip-2021-03-bigger-script-integers/39)).\n* CHIP-2021-02: [Native Introspection Opcodes](https://gitlab.com/GeneralProtocols/research/chips/-/blob/master/CHIP-2021-02-Add-Native-Introspection-Opcodes.md) enabling smart contracts to inspect the current transaction idetails (see [discussion](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/chip-2021-02-add-native-introspection-opcodes/307)).\n* Bundle with the new ElectrsCash ver 3.1.0 (see [release notes](https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/ElectrsCash/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md#310-8-march-2022))\\[\n* [BIP69](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0069.mediawiki) lexicographical sorting of transaction inputs/outputs for increased transaction privacy. A new option -usebip69= has been added to toggle this behaviour. This is enabled by default.\n\nCheck the link below for the full specification used in the upcoming May BCH upgrade.\n\n[https://upgradespecs.bitcoincashnode.org/2022-05-15-upgrade/](https://upgradespecs.bitcoincashnode.org/2022-05-15-upgrade/)\n\n## Upgrading\n\nIf you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\n\n# Credits\n\nThanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:\n\n* Andrea Suisani\n* Andrew Stone\n* Dagur Valberg Johannsson\n* Fernando Pelliccioni\n* Griffith\n* Marius Kj\u00e6rstad\n* Peter Tschipper\n\nWe have backported a set of changes from Bitcoin Core.\n\nFollowing all the indirect contributors whose work has been imported via the above backports:\n\n* Carl Dong\n* Cory Fields\n* THETCR\n* fanquake\n* fdov\n* Peter Bushnell\n* Sjors Provoost\n\nSee the full release notes at:\n\n[https://gitlab.com/bitcoinunlimited/BCHUnlimited/-/blob/dev/doc/release-notes.md](https://gitlab.com/bitcoinunlimited/BCHUnlimited/-/blob/dev/doc/release-notes.md)",

Our Uniswap based  decentralized exchange is now ready at [http://www.koingfu.com](http://www.koingfu.com) , while for our testnet we  deployed  the Sushiswap  contracts and frontend, for our mainnet we decided it was extremely important to deploy Uniswap instead. Let me share some details of why we did this.\n\nFirst, let me just say what an amazing job the other teams working on decentralized exchanges are doing. Ben, Mist, Tango, upcoming Verse and others, are working on secure platforms and we are very happy to see them grow with users and volume.  We needed to wait a bit before launching our swap, as launching before farm incentivized swaps created a risk of them inadvertently doing a vampire attack on us. You can read more about vampire attacks here: [https://finematics.com/vampire-attack-sushiswap-explained/](https://finematics.com/vampire-attack-sushiswap-explained/).  Now that the farms are in place, and users had time to farm multiple tokens to a certain level of inflation the risk is low. We are trying to position our swap so that it does not compete with farms, but instead complements them. Is also important to notice in order for farms to work, farm swaps need flexibility on their token issuance, while in our case the issuance is fixed, so an incentive for users to move part of the liquidity to us. While we where very quick to deploy the Swap on testnet, doing so for our mainnet took a lot more care. We put in place  security infrastructure and practices to deploy the contracts securely, and creating a path to move from V2 version of the contracts, to V3 version as soon as the Uniswap license allows us. The technical and legal roads selected by Uniswap and Sushiswap/Pancakeswap are very different, and we believe future development of these projects will deviate them further apart.\n\nThere were  technical and  legal reasons for us to avoid a farm based swap like Sushiswap or Pancake swap.  As part of our plan, we have deployed our contracts not only on SmartBCH but on multiple networks, so that we can then bridge all the networks together and incentivize value to flow into SmartBCH. The extra complexity of farms contracts did not fit well with this idea. As for the legal reasons, we are following the same path that Uniswap took, farms increase legal responsibilities and stop us from being covered by prior Uniswap legal framework. Sadly a certain level of compliance  means that for now we are unable to provide service to the USA and other restricted countries, just as the upcoming Verse platform is also limited to. Thankfully there are multiple other swaps on the ecosystem that do not have this restrictions and can serve all countries.\n\nWe would like to thank all the community that supported us, if you contributed to our Flipstarter we will be gifting you our new token \"$Ki\" to show our appreciation for your support. We will be doing an additional post with details of our token Ki and how we are distributing it. Trading of our token \"Ki\"  will start when this post is 24 hours, so that everyone can get a fair start.  Ki is central to our community, contracts and DAO plans.\n\nWe have done a lot of work on our bridge, after testing several bridge implementations including RSKBridge and Wormhole bridge we decided the right thing to do was to build our own. We will follow up this post with full details on our new bridge design. We are also preparing a white paper with a more technical explanation of everything we are building, and will share it as we move forward\n\nThe extra time allowed us to work on a few new things, our contract verifier is turning into a multi network block explorer. As we made progress with our multi-network bridge it became clear that we needed several tools that are not part of our ecosystem so we build them. The multi-network explorer is extremely important as it allow to access the information needed for users to validate bridge transactions. Following the same ideal of the SmartBCH EVM design, we have also done a lot of optimization work, you will notice that our contracts burn a lot less gas than the other swaps, not only on SmartBCH but on the other EVMs we have deployed to.\n\nAgain a BIG thank you to everyone on the community for your support! We are only getting started, have a lot to share and cant wait to show you all the cools things we have been working on!",

Funded\n\nWe're almost there Team BCH! We've had some incredibly generous donations from some amazing BCH supporters that have gotten us very close to getting funded. A massive thank you to everyone who has already pledged. As of writing were at **305.62*****/*****425.00BCH**. That means there's less than 120BCH to go and we've got 2 and a bit days left to get it locked in.\n\nWe need your support to get us over the finish line. We already have the venue booked and deposit down, catering booked, furniture booked, and a bunch of other things started to spin up ready for the event. We had a big team brainstorm today and we're all super excited about how amazing this event is going to be and how big of a splash it's going to make.\n\n# Reaching The Wider Crypto Community\n\nWe'll be inviting the whole London crypto community to the project pitches, awards ceremony and afterparty so they will all get to see just how much of a game-changer SmartBCH is for crypto adoption.\n\n# Win A Ledger Nano S\n\nWe still have the competition running that one of the people who pledge will receive a Ledger Nano S (if the campaign is successfully funded). We'll pick this person out of a hat and announce this at the end of the week.\n\n# The Blockchain Hangout London\n\nWe host the [biggest crypto Meetup](https://meetup.com/coinriot) in London which is growing every month. We had 240RSVPs last month and this month we're aiming for 300. HackSmart will be heavily promoted to our attendees at every Meetup leading up to the event and of course we'll be advertising the event all around London and online to make sure we get a full house of talented people attend.\n\n# Sponsorship\n\nIf you are interested in sponsoring the event we have a ton of options available. Please just send us a private message here and we'll find a great solution for you!\n\n# Let's Go\n\nWith your help we can get this funded, and then we'll get it organised and make it a huge success for SmartBCH, and by extension BCH! \n\n# [hacksmart.org](https://hacksmart.org)",

To prevent more disclosure, even of mundane matters like the name of its chief investment officer, Tether has gone to court to block public-records requests about its business.\n\n\n>Tether\u2019s attorneys argued in court filings that additional disclosure of its reserve investments would harm its competitive position in the market and that revealing its chief investment officer\u2019s name would \u201cconstitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u201d\n\n\n>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission found last year that Tether only held equivalent dollar reserves in its accounts on a little more than a quarter of the days during a roughly two-year period, leading Tether to reach a $41 million settlement with the regulatory agency. Tether neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing\u00a0as part of its settlement with the CFTC.\n\n\n>One short seller also sees trouble in Tether\u2019s holdings of money-market funds and Treasury bills. That firm learned that an affiliate of Deltec Bank & Trust Ltd., a Bahamian bank where Tether does business, sought to invest billions of dollars in outside hedge funds that invest in highly liquid securities, people familiar with the matter said.\u00a0\n\nWhat if Deltec invested in hedge funds takung bets of tether shorts?

If it is something you feel you can create and are willing to do the work, this is a tool that I would contribute to. No pressure, I know you've got a lot on your plate.\n\n(I am going to get some terms wrong) I am thinking a tool that is that one can run on their local machine. Point it to the the folder that contains your blockchain (I run both Core and Cash full nodes[both QT derived]) . Then provide an address 1 (both legacy and Cash) and then, at least, address 2; to determine if there are any collisions between the two.\n\nAlso, the ability to trace the addresses from creation to current address.",

I already heard before and know some people who say that adding other traditional financial assets could balance the risk and stabilize the overall return. But here's what I've found out about this subject.  \n\n\nWe all witnessed that cryptocurrencies, gold, and crude oil are still on the capitalist battlefield. Bitcoin has piqued the interest of worldwide investors because of its exceptional returns that outperform all other assets. Crude oil and gold have done well in recent years as a result of their resistance to negative conditions.  \n\n\nAs the article says \"It's interesting how by combining these three key assets, the portfolio holder is able to defend him/herself from uncertainties and preserve value (gold and bitcoin), benefit from economic growth (crude oil and bitcoin), and invest in the future (bitcoin).\"  \n\n\nSynthetic asset project DeFi 3.0 Duet Protocol recently listed dXAU (gold) and dWTI (oil). Users may obtain gold, oil, and bitcoin which is already available on the site, allowing them to establish a portfolio that includes both traditional and crypto assets using a single crypto wallet. This all seems so interesting, I'm planning to do some digging and I will let you know.   \n\n\nDo you have any experience with all of this? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jrqyw0u3kit81.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&s=018d3d71d84da4d00c56d32fecb102e023cbc2d4",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, so here is a quick guide on how you can deploy a token on SmartBCH the easy way with some basic level of security.\n\nI will strongly suggest you use a virtual machine inside your computer to  improve your security. Keep an updated backup of the virtual machine by copying its files to a flash drive or similar from time to time. Install a secure OS like Debian. The steps bellow assume you are using a virtual machine, but will work just fine if you dont.\n\nThe next step is to install Metamask, and configure SmartBCH.  You can get Metamask from here:[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)and you can configure SmartBCH by using this site:[https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org/)Search for SmartBCH and follow the instructions to add it to your Metamask.\n\nNow that you have Metamask installed and configured, is time to fund your wallet. You can use [Coinflex.com](https://Coinflex.com) or [https://hop.cash/](https://hop.cash/) , to move some BCH into your wallet. Also ask around maybe some one can share some for your tests.\n\nOk, so at this point you have a safe work environment and a wallet with some BCH.\n\nNext Step go to:[https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will see this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3y0au1dvgkw81.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a7f0345dc1839aec0a7eaca7a9122fab5ee3653\n\nNow right click over the contracts folder, click new file and write MyToken.sol, you will get this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MyToken.sol](https://preview.redd.it/mrerjbk2hkw81.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc592cb1a788e88be485e029bc411eec87f4d509)\n\nNow we need to add the code that will mint your token! We will be creating the most basic token possible, enter this code on the main section:\n\n`pragma solidity ^0.8.4;import \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\";contract MyToken is ERC20 {constructor() ERC20(\"Lucky\", \"Lucky\") {_mint(msg.sender, 21000000 * 10 ** decimals());}}`\n\nit will look like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8wiw67gvhkw81.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7781118276976470c2a9137274fca9d4e74d6f8\n\nTry changing the name of the token, and the number of tokens on the code. Example change Lucky, for MoonLambo, and the ticker to mlb. Change the number of tokens, do you want 21million? change it to a trillion so you can be a Lambo trillionaire already.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, so now your code is ready! and you are ready to go to the moon! Now we are going to send this code into the SmartBCH blockchain, but first we need to compile the code, so do this:\n\nclick this icon on the left:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[click this to switch to the compiler](https://preview.redd.it/mm17utjdikw81.png?width=137&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c23dbb1b5f1ee296be137b10b0b8a80dcb8192c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSelect 0.8.13 for your compiler:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[0.8.13 for latest of the greatest](https://preview.redd.it/p6bxhr0kikw81.png?width=308&format=png&auto=webp&s=001770db93f14e567bfd70b108549ee826d6960d)\n\nNow click compile!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[all systems go](https://preview.redd.it/gad06xvqikw81.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7c2faa2110bd53db651f12e3bf20bee43fcc9d3)\n\nNow that your code is compiled we are going to send it, click  this icon on your left menu:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b3x7fl6wjkw81.png?width=49&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c745e9bd89204bfa1c80861105d877d4431484d\n\nyou will see something like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[we are ready to deploy!](https://preview.redd.it/chqdyar1kkw81.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa389b789016fbe315eac3a487a43ee4063fc68c)\n\nClick on Environment, and select Injected Web3. Your Metamask will open, may ask for your password and asl you to connect, follow the instructions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vrsmmwuckkw81.png?width=372&format=png&auto=webp&s=118dd1f11aba0d795c6317c9f664a23a3416c71d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nnow Select MyToken.sol here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[3 2 1](https://preview.redd.it/anhg8gg5kkw81.png?width=339&format=png&auto=webp&s=5365f4de5b2edd5ed01c871d08c23b8ceca70f5e)\n\nClick deploy, follow the Metamask instructions, confirm the transaction.\n\nNow watch the bottom of your screen, you will see this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[your token is ready!](https://preview.redd.it/dw98vqprkkw81.png?width=1589&format=png&auto=webp&s=577b0f1fdd0727c7d1fd40f4b6009ba9014240f5)\n\nAt the left you can see the contract address that was assigned to the contract you just deployed.  I got this one writing the guide: 0x91637f0FA58E5A319427e86d9FC43593774E689b\n\nNow we need to add that to Metamask! so do this, go to Metamask, click Assets and find this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zbgq1di0lkw81.png?width=420&format=png&auto=webp&s=40b40115af992dc29c4bd59951c2b689dc1910fd\n\nClick on Import tokens, and add the contract address that you generated on the steps above:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29ckts96lkw81.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=5877aaafc7fd4cbacacfd4bb2673645ee9c79e6e\n\nEnter the address, the other parameters will  appear. Click Add Custom Token.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v4etln6flkw81.png?width=368&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d1e99f423c1a5d7eee2d0ae87f1230546dac6a9\n\nCongratulations, you just minted a token on SmartBCH with a basic level of security! Next send some tokens around and share the Good Luck!\n\nTry to be creative, meme tokens are cool, but think on creative ways to **give utility to your tokens.**",

Because that taints the reputation of our endeavour and can destroy the efforts put in by those working on adoption.\n\n> If someone hires a troll army to attack a community by astroturfing fake support for something, can you respect that person? If someone drives people who disagree away with personal abuse, is that a reasonable method for coming to an agreement about a protocol? Is it a valid form of technical reasoning to launch a sabotage against a block chain based consensus mechanism? What can you say about someone who buys existing accounts of users whom others trust in order to fake trusted support for their agenda? How about when it happens after those users whom others trust have been driven away or left in disgust? Is it a respectful negotiator interested in the insights of others in solving a problem, whose negotiating skills include locking the damn doors and refusing to let someone leave the room until they get his signature on an \u201cagreement\u201d that they wrote without his knowledge before he even got there?\n\n> Is someone who would participate in a fight, on those terms, someone whose agenda or business interests you really want to support? Hint: You already know that people who fake support for their agenda, or tell lies about other in order to discredit them, or who deliberately deceive others about the merits of their own proposal or others\u2019 proposals, are doing business by means of fraud. Do you want to carry on until the fraud is financial and the victim is you?\n\nTake these wise words from one of the first Bitcoiners and a real cypherpunk to heart. He literally helped Satoshi by reviewing the code of Bitcoin before it was ever released. He accompanied Bitcoin at the very least from inception through the block size wars and the creation of Bitcoin Cash. While he was skeptical about the success of forks based on the above considerations, he was not opposed to them on a technical level. I encourage you to read the whole interview.\n\nWe would ignore his views on the ethics of the project at our peril. Let us not be doomed to repeat any history.",

(These numbers are not verifiable. The authors of this paper tried, unsuccessfully, to contact multiple government entities to receive more quantitative information, including Chivo customer service, El Salvador\u2019s Superintendent of the Financial System, El Salvador\u2019s Central Bank, and El Salvador\u2019s Casa Presidencial.) To overcome this challenge, we conduct a nationally representative survey to generate data that would be otherwise unobtainable. The survey, which involves 1,800 households, was conducted via face-to-face interviews to avoid the selection issues that may emerge if the survey conditioned respondents on owning a phone or having internet access.",

Foerster, Christian Decker, and Stefan Schmid was presented today at the [Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2022](https://fc22.ifca.ai/program.html) conference. Note that one of the authors is affiliated with Blockstream.\n\nThey collected data the state of the Lightning Network's nodes and channels over 2019-2021 and then calculated some metrics about how concentrated nodes and transaction routing was. Some key conclusions:\n\n>To just give one example, our analysis shows that the top 10% of all nodes control a vast majority of all transaction routes, and that the controlled share increases over time, see Fig. 1....  \n>  \n>Overall, we can deduce that the Lightning Network is highly centralized. Having only few, very influential nodes through which most paths are routed, is not beneficial for the robustness of the network. These nodes pose as significant targets for attacks and could disrupt the network in the case of failure. However not only attackers could exploit this situation, but also the nodes or rather the individuals controlling these nodes.",

A block header is always only 80 bytes (!!) and with this and only this information it's trivial for your wallet to perfectly prove that a given transaction is contained in a given block.

See the section in the white paper. This is how Bitcoin was always intended to scale.\n\nWith SPV your wallet only has to download 8 *bytes* roughly every minute.

For example, Bitcoin.com wallet? \n\nMy understanding is that the intent is for most people to use SPV nodes/wallets and then they rely on others such as miners running full nodes, maybe some big merchants, nerds, etc to run the full nodes. A complaint will be that you can't trust them, you need to run a full node in order to ensure the network is working properly.. My argument back would be that the whole system is designed such that everyone's personal interest balances each other to ensure trust. It is in the miners interest to ensure a strong and secure network that provides maximum transaction throughput to increase their fee rewards. It is in the regular users interest to run an SPV node and trust that miners don't want to defraud the system and destroy the network. I also understand that SPV nodes connect to multiple full nodes to verify that the information they are getting is true so it would take an incredible amount of collusion against multiple full nodes interest to defraud the system.\n\nI think I'm getting on the right track.. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

You do control your keys, but only connect to bitcoin.com's servers.\n\nA wallet like Electron Cash is SPV.\n\nOne problem is that SPV wasn't already included in the Bitcoin software that Satoshi built, and was never included when he left. It should have been finished and integral from the go. Same with pruning. So there was no existing \"minimum feature set\" baseline.\n\nFortunately most BCH clients seem to be building in true SPV functionality now so that's going to be big when they all support SPV clients.\n\n> A complaint will be that you can't trust them, you need to run a full node in order to ensure the network is working properly.\n\n*Some* economically relevant non mining nodes are needed in order to ensure Nakamoto consensus, sure. But everyone doesn't need one. Hell there are [only around 8000 BTC full nodes](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/nodes). Clearly there aren't only 8000 users.\n\nThere are all kinds of applications that require running a full node. There are millions of people and organizations with the wherewithal to maintain a node at most any scale. If even one percent of these people and institutions run nodes, that's tens of thousands of nodes.\n\nThe idea that the world's future money system depends on hobbyists in their basement and will break if they can't participate as a peer is silly.\n\n> trust that miners don't want to defraud the system and destroy the network\n\nNope! You don't need to trust their intentions. You only need to trust that Nakamoto consensus disincentivizes miners from cheating and ensures that they'll get caught if they do.",

There are already 354 million people across 51 countries worldwide with access to gigabit internet with more capacity coming on every day. There is more than enough network capacity available to keep the network decentralized at low cost at 1GB scale.\n\nAt this scale, currently the bottleneck seems to be transaction validation and mempool acceptance rate. But with current clients we've already shown it's possible to sync a 200MB/block chain on cheap consumer hardware (RPi). With better software optimized for the more advanced CPUs coming out (ie M1) it's not hard to imagine being able to sync 1GB blocks on the cheap hardware of next year or so.\n\nWhat seems to be the problem? There are millions of people, and millions of organizations, that can trivially afford these very minimal costs.",

Well then, what's the sense of scalability if it isnt used? Rather increase security then. Anyway, if you seriously want to use BCH for everyday transactions, blocks are going to be full and decentralization is decreasing because number of nodes who store the full chain are going to decrease. F transactional throughput, you have that with centralized solutions. What we need is a decentralized value layer as foundation to centralized solutions. In the end, what matters is size of the value that is transacted via a decentralized network, not the number of transactions. To put it bluntly, once off-chain scaling is achieved by layering networks on top of the main chain, even 1 tps is more than enough to handle everything properly.",

            "selftext": "Another Bitcoin Automated Teller Machine (ATM) has apparently been installed in Mexico City, this time in the Senate building. Some local leaders, like Miguel ngel Mancera, were reportedly behind the action.\n\nAccording to local reports, the Mexican government built the 14th Bitcoin ATM in the Senate building in Mexico City, indicating that the digital asset will be used again in the future. Cancn, Tijuana, Guadalajara, and Culiac\u00e1n are among the cities with the remaining 13 such devices. \n\nIt's worth mentioning that the move was pushed through by certain well-known Mexican leaders. Miguel Angel Mancera, the past mayor of Mexico City, is one of them. He believes bitcoin has established itself as a viable competitor to major payment networks like PayPal and Visa, and that it is on its way to becoming mainstream:\n\n\"I believe it has already reached a boiling point, as we would call it in evolution,\" says the author.\n\nIndira Kempis, a Mexican senator and a proponent of the bitcoin industry, promoted the idea on Twitter. She proclaimed the well-known phrase \"to the moon\" as she stood close to the ATM. \n\nFollowing that, Ricardo Monreal, President of the Senate's Political Coordination Board, suggested that Mexico's government should embrace the crypto industry and create a regulatory framework. Other Central and South American countries, such as Panama, Argentina, Brazil, and Peru, have already joined the bandwagon, he noted. As a result, Mexico should follow suit in order to avoid falling behind in this area. Bitcoin by all means is the flagship of the crypto world being the most traded and valuable crypto over the likes of ETH and XRP, Memecoins like Doge and Ripple and NFT utility tokens like Sandbox and $Cray of the Crayon Dao. Such win by BTC represents a win to the crypto society at large.\n\nSenator Kempis announced in February that he will fight for legislation to make Mexico the second country, after El Salvador, to recognize bitcoin as a legal tender. \n\n\"We need bitcoin to be legal tender in Mexico because if it isn't, it will be very difficult to take action,\" she stated at the time.\n\nShe also stressed the importance of such legislation, citing the fact that millions of Mexicans lack access to fundamental financial services, and that cryptocurrency may be a viable alternative. \n\nKempis submitted a measure centered on digital assets over two weeks ago. It was not, however, intended to make BTC legal tender. Instead, she went against CBDCs, claiming that \"only the central bank\" in Mexico could issue a digital currency.",

After all, people I debate in this subreddit often cite  energy use as security, and promote reinvestment in clean energy.\n\nHowever, this is an example of exploitation in my home, the American midwest. This mining outfit gets their energy from 50% coal. They selected the area specifically to take advantage of cheap coal power.\n\nThis is why I post here. I am tired of zealots here defending energy use when profits aren't proportionately invested in clean power. Nic Carter can't defend this kind of thing.\n\nTheir expansion goes up for a hearing before a zoning commission in a week. Personally I hope everybody there reads this article.\n\nThis is a classic example of NIMBY, but it's so unethical to mine using this kind of energy mix that indeed nobody should do it in any backyard. The same arguments made for e.g. a homeless shelter don't carry weight here.\n\nMeanwhile there are other NIMBY groups fighting against clean energy like wind in the Midwest because \"it's ugly\".",

They ensure local power outputs max capacity except during hot days, i.e. it wastes energy by keeping up demand even when it's not needed. \n\nThis is not a Texas flaring operation, where they can say the gas would be burnt and wasted anyway. The coal would have just sat there if they didn't need it, which is good.\n\nThey champion this anyway because they include clean energy in their mix. This obfuscates all the coal they use at the same time. It's alongside other relatively clean projects they partnered on, which makes the Grundy Center operation look like the ugly wasteful project they need to hide with greenwashing.\n\nThis is all about wealth generation and trying to incorporate BTC into Iowa infrastructure to make mining \"too big to fail.\" It's driven by American interests, not Chinese, as far as I can tell.",

Ross built the first bitcoin-powered dark-web market Silk Road. This was all new 'criminal' tech at the time, and the US govt. sent him to maximum security prison for two lifetimes plus 40 years, without parole. But he still keeps up, and regularly writes about crypto and DeFi from prison.\n\n[Part 1](https://rss.com/podcasts/room-of-lives/333530/) is a talk that I arranged Lyn to give at the University of Texas at Austin. She presents her view on the case of Ross and Silk Road, and the misuses of law she thinks the US govt. carried out.\n\n[Part 2](https://rss.com/podcasts/room-of-lives/333531/) is a one-on-one conversation we had on my couch. Lyn shares her experience of Ross' trial, her views on US amendment violations, digital snooping, prisons and the drug war, and lessons from her activism. Then we talk about Ross the person: his upbringing, philosophies, affinity for eastern spirituality and meditation, and how he's been doing in prison.",

I run a big block mining pool, write for CoinGeek, etc\u2026\n\nBut I had a drink with a software engineer from Blockstream in Miami last month, and we had a really valuable conversation about the original CounterParty token protocol and things like 51% attacks but with miners exhibiting the same kind of autonomy as he would expect from a UASF node operator. We had a really good time talking about our mutual love for bitcoin. \n\nThen last weekend, I had went to a BBQ with Marc Falzon and Ryan Griffin who have been focused on BCH merchant adoption around south Florida for the last month or so, and we had a really good time talking and sharing what we love about bitcoin too. All of our kids played together, and it was a great time. \n\nMore than anything, I just wanted to extend an olive branch and say hi to some old friends in here. When you spend time in person, it really puts the nonsense into perspective. If anyone wants to hang out or DM, I think we all need to do better at cooperating - myself included. \n\nTake care, bitcoiners.",
