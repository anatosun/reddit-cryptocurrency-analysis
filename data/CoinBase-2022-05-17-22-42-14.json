It can take between 1-5 days starting from when you first transferred the money. \n\nYou could just spend the money on Coinbase if you are in a hurry to buy or something. The difference in fees between coinbase and pro is about 1% if you have the money already deposited there (meaning you aren't buying with a debit card). So for example if you wanted to buy $500 worth of crypto:\n\nOn Coinbase you would pay about $7.50 in fees.\n\nAnd on Coinbase pro you would pay like $2.50 in fees.\n\nSo based on that you can make a decision whether or not you want to wait or just buy now on Coinbase.",

I kept getting e-mails saying my funds were available to withdraw, but when using my laptop to try to make the transfers over to CoinBase Pro to save on fees, it said the funds were on hold.\n\nAfter Googling it, it looks like a lot of people are having this problem.  One person advised that they were able to do the transfers in the mobile app. When I tried that, it worked. Next thing you know, I'm also able to transfer my funds from the website, using my laptop, after it was just telling me the funds were on hold.\n\nACH transfers from your bank are supposed to be on hold for 3-5 business days, wires are subject to a 1-3 day hold, and debit card purchases are supposed to be available immediately ([https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/add-a-payment-method/payment-methods-for-us-customers](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/add-a-payment-method/payment-methods-for-us-customers)).\n\nSome redditors were saying their funds were still on hold after 4 months!! I smell a class action brewing if there isn't already one filed. Document, document, document, and see if it won't  allow you to deposit to CoinBase Pro from the website, but will from the mobile app.\n\nLooks like a total scam to keep people on CoinBase so that they can continue to charge higher fees for trades. Beware and try transferring from your mobile app.",

I found out that the hold time is listed when you purchase the coin though (I missed it initially) which should have been \"up to 6 days\", and like I said it looks like that's not going to turn out to be quite true. \n\nI saw a different post (from 3 years ago) where someone said it took them 4 months. Most of the posts seemed to average around 2 weeks, but another said something outlandish like 8 months or something like that as well. I'd hope they've improved well beyond that since 3 years ago though. \n\nThe weird part about my case is they let me withdraw a few bucks but not my full $200. And yesterday it said I could withdraw like 2 cents but today it said zero.\n\nI'm actively looking for a better solution but I'm not sure if any others are any better. Anyone have a good experience with Gemini? Or COTI?",
