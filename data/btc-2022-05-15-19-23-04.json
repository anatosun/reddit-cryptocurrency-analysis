All smart contracts going forward will be much more space efficient, allowing Bitcoin Cash to scale better.\n3. It enables next steps of improvement to smart contracts that will put BCH smart contract ability on par with even EVM.\n\nUsers won't be able to notice any change immediately. As you mentioned, that's actually a great thing. A lot of thought and work went into making these upgrades without breaking anything.",
