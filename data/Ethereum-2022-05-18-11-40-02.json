I think this would be a good implementation cause right now the gas fees kill any type of reward if you\u2019re staking a small amount, \n\nAlso with Rocketpool, does the staking rewards come automatically for you to claim or do you have to unstake the eth to claim?",

This is the same as staking it on the official site.\n\nHere are the contract addresses: https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-rpl-token-upgrade-new-addresses-e96c12c55adf\n\nStaking rewards are automatically included in the token price against ETH. For example, when you buy 1 rETH it might be worth 1.02 ETH, and a year later when you want to trade it away it will be worth 1.06 ETH. You don't need to claim anything. Check the price on whatever DEX you use to make sure you're getting a decent rate.",
