Powell still believe in a solid Economy, using the US unemployment rate as a prove of truth, so we can suppose that he will not stop he's policy, at least for a while.\n\nIn this scenario we can't expect anything good from Nasdaq and so the same from BTC until it will still be related with it.\n\nMaybe we will see 36K because of a pull-back.
