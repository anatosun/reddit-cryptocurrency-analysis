We can have some bumps in the road like everything\u2026 but, the fundamentals are the same. And it\u2019s going to work because the philosophy of it is right. Just give it time. It\u2019s going to work for El Salvador, it\u2019s going to work for Bitcoin, it\u2019s going to work for the world.\u201d\n\u2014 Nayib Bukele",

Peter asked hard questions, but let him off easy by not asking any questions about the bitcoin bond.\n\nHope some of you listen to the pod. I find Bukele and El Salvador very brave and deserving of our support as they stand up to the incumbent world powers.",

I think some confusion comes from the fact that Chivo wallet was rolled out to the public last fall, but businesses are just now being \u201crequired\u201d to accept Bitcoin in the coming weeks. \n\nBukele said that they had to write the law that way to get the big corporations like McDonald\u2019s and Walmart to go comply and accept Bitcoin. Also interesting to hear that there are 70 Walmarts in El Salvador.",
