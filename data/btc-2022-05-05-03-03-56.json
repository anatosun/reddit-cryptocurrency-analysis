Unless the ecosystem has another SPV server available with better performance, it may be a good idea to postpone raising the limit beyond 64 or 80 MB until performance is fixed.\n\nOn the other hand, a reasonable argument can be made that Fulcrum desync is not a critical failure, as Fulcrum will catch up eventually as long as the peak loads aren't sustained, and Fulcrum desync does not compromise the protocol's safety or mining incentives in any way.\n\nFulcrum appears to be about 40x slower than BCHN at block processing. BCHN serves a more performance-critical role in the BCH ecosystem, and needs to be able to consistently validate *and propagate* blocks in about 20 seconds or less to avoid unsafe mining incentives, whereas Fulcrum only needs to do so in about 600 seconds or less (i.e. 30x slower). This implies that both Fulcrum and BCHN are likely to present bottlenecks in network performance at similar block sizes.",

Fulcrum has been amazingly fast when it gets what it needs, but, from the logs, our suspicion is that something was breaking.  In fact, my theory (although just a theory) was that Fulcrum wasn't getting the information it needed in a timely manner because of the BCHN global lock blocking the RPC calls (I think BCHN complained in the logs that the RPC queue got filled up, IIRC, so it just started dropping stuff).\n\nRegardless, I'm optimistic that we can get Calin the information he needs to look into why we're seeing what we're seeing.  Of course, it's possible we just messed something up or misconfigured something, but at a minimum, the results we were seeing were very repeatable.",

It can process BTC blocks in under 100 msec and largish BCH blocks in under 200 msec.

I have two machines that are bitcoin nodes with Fulcrum servers, one on the BCH blockchain (BCHN) and one on the BTC blockchain (Core).    I compiled the Fulcrum from source code and was surprised that the same image worked on both block chains.  \n\nThe only problem I had with Fulcrum was due to database corruption during a hard operating system crash, which necessitated rebuilding the database from genesis, which took a few days.  One of my systems used an EVO 980 Nvme SSD and this model would not boot reliably connected to the pi due to excessive power consumption, and with a powered USB hub the system would sometimes lock up. The other system used a EVO 970 which was in spec for the pi\u2019s USB ports and has run reliably for months at a time. I mention this detail because it surfaces another concern regarding scaling:  How resilient is the database software to hardware and OS related crashes and how long does it take to recover full operation after crash recovery? In this regard, bitcoin node software was better than Fulcrum,  because despite many of these crashes it was never necessary to recover the blockchain and UTXO data all the way back to genesis.",

Fulcrum can chew on a 5MB block in under 200 msec normally.

This will be especially useful for focusing on Fulcrum performance and how well BCHN and Fulcrum work together.  I would like to give a few suggestions based on my experience running these kinds of tests a long time ago, involving timesharing, data base and transaction processing systems and later LAN hardware, switches and routers.\n\nThe results will be much more valuable if they can be extended to identify the bottlenecks involved, relating them to known performance characteristics of the test hardware and software.\n\nIn addition,  the short description of the test didn\u2019t discuss the size of the databases involved.  This affects both the BCHN node (e.g. UTXO database and TXID database) and the Fulcrum server.  In many configurations other than large server machines,  there will be significant performance impact due to RAM size and IO bottlenecks.  The IO performance of storage devices (e.g. SSD) will be critically dependent on queue depth and number of threads.\n\nIn conducting controlled tests such as these,  testing should be done until failure along as many dimensions (load, database size,  hardware configurations, etc\u2026) as possible.  This will give more confidence that the system will work in practice, provided that the system is operated at a safe margin from failure.",
