I'm okay with the volatility, but we need a progressive, continued uptrend over time or else the store of value narrative is kind of useless. I've already been DCAing Bitcoin for several years and dropping back to 3k would absolutely destroy any purchasing powering I've built up over this time. I understand the other upsides of Btc like censorship resistance and the ability to custody my own money, but it all means nothing to me if the value I've worked years for is cut by 90%. If we dropped to 3k again, you could theoretically have been buying Btc since 2017 and still have nothing to show for it after 5 years. I very much hope we never go back below 20k ever again.",

But after buying some at 15K, then for a year watching it sit at 3k-ish, then all of a sudden it's 69k,  IDK, 30K is not horrible.  I don't think it will go much lower, there is too much corporate money involved now, so i still expect to retire well in 20 years.  I'll throw a few Ben's here and there, but, if it is gonna be what it's supposed to be eventually, my .25 will suit my retirement just fine.\n\nI woulda drank that money anyway. So no biggy.  Not like you need to dump your life savings in.  My same thoughts were with GME/AMC a couple yrs ago,  i figured, why not, here's a double-digit of shares just for shits and giggles.\n\nI don't do vegas or any gambling much,  same difference i guess, to me, but, really what's a couple-few grand on something that has the potential at least?\n\nI dont even talk about it with anyone, fam, friends, etc, maybe a few here and there, but not shilling to anyone.\n\nIt either will or it wont... The ones dumping everying and risking everything are a little silly in my opinion.  If you believe what will/may happen, then there's a point where it really doesnt matter and makes no sense to go all in.",

As a result, the exchange, sale, or purchase of goods or services using cryptocurrency will generally be recognized as a capital gain or loss. Additionally, accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment in your business will trigger ordinary (rather than capital gain) income tax liability. Mining cryptos using computer software is also a taxable event that is subject to ordinary income tax and self-employment taxes. To calculate your taxes for crypto transactions, you need to take your cost basis and subtract it from your proceeds in order to get your capital gain or loss. The cost basis of your cryptocurrency is the value of the virtual currency when it is acquired. The proceeds are calculated by looking at the amount of money earned from the sale of crypto or fair market value of the coins or property received for it in an exchange. For example, a taxpayer would need to report capital gains of $2,000 if they purchased Bitcoin for $40,000 and sold it at $42,000. If they held the coins for less than a year the gain would be short term.  If held for longer than a year the gain would be long term. It is also important to note that cryptocurrency that is received for services rendered or where a product is sold will be treated differently than where a taxpayer is engaged in purely investing activity. When you accept crypto for services or product sold, you record it as ordinary income that will be taxed at your graduated income tax rate and will be subject to self-employment tax. Any eventual exchange or disposal of that cryptocurrency so acquired will then be reported as capital gains and losses. \"\n\nhttps://klasing-associates.com/irs-track-bitcoin-cryptocurrencies/\n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/virtual-currencies\n\nSure, we don't have to report it. But if you want mass adoption, then these are the rules. I don't care what you believe. \n\nCompanies might only be able to accept crypto from KYC wallets in the future. If that happens then one must prove their cost basis on any unknown Bitcoin if they want to use it. \n\nBTC is also public ledger. The government can absolutely track it to you if you bought it off an exchange. They might even be able to track down the  person you interacted with in p2p exchanges because maybe that person bought off a CEX. Then they'll question that person about the transaction\n\nLots of whatifs. Better off just not evading taxes.",
