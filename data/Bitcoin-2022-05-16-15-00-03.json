They can't control a decentralised currency.\n2. Tax reasons.\n3. They are predatory in nature and would oppose people having sovereign control of their own financial wealth and assets.\n4. If their own centralised system was at threat of being replaced with btc.\n\nEdit 2:\nLots of people aren't reading my post properly. I am well aware governments can't BAN btc. They could easily make it illegal to use though. Yes people would Still use it like they do other illegal things, but if caught then you'd have a price to pay.\nI'm trying to war game so I can avoid that potential happening and trying to work out if it's even possible.",

I used CoinTracker to figure out my gains since I had hundreds of transactions in 2021. It said I had way more capital gains than I should have and that\u2019s when I realized it took every transaction of me moving funds from Coinbase to my private wallet as a taxable event. It did this because it didn\u2019t know I owned the wallet. I begrudgingly decided I was going to input my public address into CoinTracker so it would accurately calculate my gains. Upon trying to do this I realized that a lot of the addresses my funds had been sent to from Coinbase were one time use and didn\u2019t hold my entire balance of BTC from my ledger.(so not my public key aka xbit address) I verified this by looking up the sent addresses balances on the blockchain explorer. So anyway if your wallet uses xpub(which many hardware wallets do) they can\u2019t see your full balance without the public key and you shouldn\u2019t have to move anything. If those wallets you use don\u2019t have xpub and your public key is known to Coinbase you could in theory just send them to another wallet that they have no way of verifying is you. But xpub is definitely the way to go IMO",
