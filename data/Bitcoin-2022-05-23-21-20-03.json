You are not there(as far as i know)\nIf there is anyone wanting to believe these scammers, consider this:\n1. Official contact is a shit gmail addres.\n2. They dont have an addres, contact phone or whatever \n3  they claim tgey are usa based, but in app time is si gapore, well i called SEC in usa, and they never heard of them, and said they received multiple enquiries for AUXU,. And i contacted the same authority in singapore. They never heard of them either\n4. They websites, the auxu websitw, ecot  nnpc, ndkc, tont, etc, their \"exclusive coins\" they are all registered in the same day , by the same person (who is protected by godaddy premium), registered in  china, through same hosting. The fotos of the \"team\" from voe coins. You can find them on google on a clothing store lol.\n5. That Charlotte sent a fake passport as \"proof that she is legit\"\n6. They claim to deposit money as in \"taxes  because thats what the IRS says\" so you can withdraw money, and im not talking abou few dollars  im talking thousands.\n7. Their fake coins have a pattern 90% of the time, 2 green, one red, 3 green, than, the other way around. If you look at graphic  the 5 mins one, the amount traded every 5 minutes is the same (around 75k) that is literally impossible for a coin to be traded always same amount every 5 minutes frame \n8. Their wallet is like 150k dollars. What platform has only 150k main wallet? Lmao. They claim they have 45k users? BS. Track their wallet and you will see what gets in and out and where. \n\nSo you commenting here, claiming auxu is legit. Go sing at another table. We are many on fb that ha e been scammed by them.",

Its just strange that my friend who invested 500 USDT and never has invited anyone else and withdraw with YOIF 4.500 transaction sucessfully. He also had panic about the scam thing and withdrawed instantly. I said to him its his choice. So he stopped with AUXU. Do you have a possible explanation for this? There is a case wherre someone claimed he is from AUXU I think that that kind of person \"charlotte\" I personally never heard of her and didnt got invited by her. There is a case that someone is disguising as fake AUXU Global and maybe thats her.",

Linda, my advice customer from Whatsapp tell me if I can withdraw that money i need to deposit 1% from total assets! Thats meens I have to deposit 2300$! Now I figured it is a scam because they can stop the fees from my earned money in the Auxu! Why I need to deposit other amount of money? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Anyway, it seems i lose 900$ but it will be mind learning do not trust in Amber and other sexy girls \ud83d\ude02",
