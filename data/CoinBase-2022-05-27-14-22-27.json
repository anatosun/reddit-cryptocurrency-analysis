My questions:\n\n1.  Am I banned for using Coinbase forever?\n2. Do I need to file a claim for a review to see if I can open an account?\n3. Is there a waiting period before I can try to open a new account?\n4. If they would just warn me that it is prohibited I would of not violated the policy.  My fault for not reading carefully.  \n\nThank you for your input.",
