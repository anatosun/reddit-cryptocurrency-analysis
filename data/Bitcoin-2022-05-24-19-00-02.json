It's so 90s, I know, but I balance the force by implementing the latest bleeding edge stuff like LNURL and LNAddress in it! It so requires some sats to post on it :)\n\nSo, if you ever used my faucet, or maybe the good old [spruned](https://github.com/mempoolco/spruned), or you just had fun watching that the [first segwit transaction](https://bitcoinexplorer.org/tx/8f907925d2ebe48765103e6845c06f1f2bb77c6adc1cc002865865eb5cfd5c1c@481824) ever broadcast on mainnet wasn't made by sipa :V ... mind to drop me an Hi, and a couple of sat.\n\nAh, yeah, it's in italian, and it would be pleasing to see ppl posting in their own mother tongue as well :-)\n\nI hope to [see you there](https://100nodi.mempool.co) =)",
