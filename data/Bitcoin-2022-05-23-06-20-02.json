Removing transaction selection from the pool's role prevents centralization. The pool's role reverts to the original intention - fair distribution of rewards  \n\nThat's the good news  \n\nThe bad news is that it's optional, and that most miners rely on pools supplying all the transactions for a candidate block because the pool has a node and the miner does not have a node  \n\nAlso, since 2016, the pools (all but one) have developed a technique for building the transaction set for the next two blocks in advance. This enables miners to work on full blocks with every hash. The pool which isn't participating in this technique is known to mine empty blocks  \n\nIf miners are selecting their own transactions, will they be able to use this \"current, plus 2\" technique to have their blocks ready without delay?",

The problem is, nothing like bitcoin has EVER been invented before. There is no definition for what bitcoin is right now. Governments all see it differently (and tax it however they think it fits). It's like when bittorrent was invented... no one was really quite sure how to explain it (or how to sue the people pirating with it).\n\nMichael Saylor believes bitcoin is best designed and used as an asset class. He sees it as a store of value (simply storing value until it is necessary later). In many ways, he compares this to storing energy.\n\nSome people think it's a currency. Roger Ver, Craig Wright, etc. were all pushing for this idea when they shilled during the block size wars. \n\nCurrently in the US it is being treated as a commodity, and taxed as capital gains. In other countries it is treated as a currency. If you ask someone like Andreas Antonopoulos and the like, you'll see that bitcoin is evolving into a currency. If you follow the ancient history of money, you can see how money begins first as a collectible (sea shells) then turns into a store of value, then eventually ends up as a currency. Each stage of the evolution of money has certain requirements that must be met. Fungibility, durability, ease of transport, etc. So far, bitcoin has not only passed all these tests, but has excelled at them.\n\nThe question really is, how are YOU going to use bitcoin? Never in the history of this planet have we had the ability to take our energy, and use it to vote in a voluntary system, on a global scale, completely decentralized. Every day people are using bitcoin to establish a new value scale that EVERYTHING else in the world will be eventually valued in. Whether you want to call that a currency, or an asset, or \"virtual real estate\", doesn't matter because the value is what is being measured and compared. Bitcoin is the ruler that all other global hatch marks will have to find their place on.",
