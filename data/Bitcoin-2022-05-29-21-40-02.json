            "selftext": "On 4/26 Blockchain.com sent me an email telling me my account was compromised. I had told them several times it was not, but they didn\u2019t care. Fair enough, I understood but was still annoyed because they support system is trash and they take forever. So I had to submit all of these documents and recent transaction written down and send them over to them via email. I had to make a new account and get it verified to receive the funds they were gonna transfer from my old account. I do all of that, then play the waiting game. I notice about two weeks in my old account was deleted, but I didn\u2019t receive my funds yet on my new account.. so I reach out, and get ignored. I wait another week or two, check back and my new account they made me make to receive my funds was deleted. It won\u2019t even let me use their live chat, and they won\u2019t respond to me over email. Has this happened to anyone else? I lost a decent amount of money from this and I\u2019m hurtin cuz of it now",

These scammers today can make everything look and seem legit and it's very hard to tell. I still think it was a scam but I hope im wrong for your sake. If you ever get anything saying your accounts were compromised, the first thing you should do is long into your account and check to see if everything is good. If nothing has happened to your account its most likely an attempt to get your account info.",

If you were robbed, then they did a real mind job on you, because you are absolutely sure that you weren't robbed and instead [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) just really sucks. People always complain on this subreddit about [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com), when you can find many, many warnings about [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) on this subreddit and elsewhere. Makes no sense. This is like those posts in which someone asks, \"Is \\[insert obscure, no-name app\\] any good?\" Only [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) is widely known to be unreliable. It's almost like people are *trying* to find ways to throw money away.\n\nSounds like you got really fast customer service, like they were right on top of it. Is there any possibility that you do have a ticket but also got robbed? Did you follow any links in their emails? You probably shouldn't, no matter how legitimate an email looks. How do you know that your computer wasn't somehow compromised, and that your attacker wasn't watching your interaction with customer support as it happened? Or, if you were in live chat with bogus customer support, then of course any email that you received during live chat was also bogus. If you gave your attacker all the documents that they would need to prove that they were you, they could have submitted a ticket on your behalf.\n\nI hope that this is just an instance of [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) being [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) and that things get straightened out eventually. But a lot of what we've seen is many hapless folks who are not security-minded getting fleeced.",

Only you and the seller know you purchased Bitcoin.\n\nThe only thing is that it has a clever mechanism so that people don't cheat so you probably have to own some Bitcoin already to put in escrow. But once that is done and set up, and is not rocket science, Bisq remains one lf the best ways of buying Bitcoin without KYC.",

And then once done you can remove both the purchased Bitcoin and this Bitcoin as escrow, which never leaves your ownership, and that's it. \n\nNot the easiest way, but the cleanest and best way to purchase Bitcoin.",
