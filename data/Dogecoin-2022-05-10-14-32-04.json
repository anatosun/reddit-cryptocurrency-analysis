Their heads are so screwed up around politics, they rig elections and throw their people into costly and deadly war instead of first thinking about what way is best for the people. And that is advancing technology to a more Eco-friendly plateau, instead of outcompeting them militarily and through deception. The people are happiest when at peace and achieving wellbeing, and research advances more steadily while people are happy and well-funded.",
