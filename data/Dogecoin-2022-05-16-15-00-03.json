The other front he's being attacked on is regarding not so much his ego but his IDs.\n\nHes radioactive. I thought it'd be worthwhile to counter balance but to have it directly feed the propaganda is just insulting to everyone involved. Even to him. I can't identify with how you can just lie like that\n\nIf it were entirely up to me 247 doge would just never once have any reference to him again and continue the slow steady growth we started off at 530 am at the exact point of the reversal right after the post was dropped.\n\nHis buddy may traffic the blood of the young to get old rich people high but he ghoulishly traficks in the dead with missing death certs.",
