(Money entering crypto)\n\nThe prob is, don\u2019t know who could honestly answer how long until that new level of growth will actually happen. \n\nThis year (prob..not), next year (maybe\u2026), 4 years, 7 years\u2026\n\nCrypto is future currency source and will continue to grow.\n\nBTC, Doge, ETH are leading coins backed by communities too large to not exist in the near future expansion of crypto. \n\nSame time Any could fall out.

When 1 sided exists, I could recommend that as an alternative, but not for your whole bag (just until the platform gets older).  \n\n\nAny 'earn' programs on a CEX are directly contributing to people shorting doge.",
