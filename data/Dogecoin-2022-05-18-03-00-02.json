It's not a proof of stake coin. \n\nIf you wanna liquidity provide for APY, you can do that on thorchain although it's two sided(no single sided yet, it's coming), and there are some minor risks involved (it's still a young platform, and if two sided, there's exposure to rune). When 1 sided exists, I could recommend that as an alternative, but not for your whole bag (just until the platform gets older).  \n\n\nAny 'earn' programs on a CEX are directly contributing to people shorting doge.",
