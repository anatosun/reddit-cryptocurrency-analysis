In my opinion the hash rate will lower to the point where it becomes profitable to miners. In anticipation of the no new coin age one can argue that miners will already bail out 5-10 years prior to no new coins being mined anymore. Many miners will stay because they will receive the revenue from validating TXs. Who knows? By that time the adoption could be all over and even with no new BTC the hash rate could be multiples of what it is now.",
