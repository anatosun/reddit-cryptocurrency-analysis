I want to pay using a Vanilla Visa Gift Card. What would be the best option to go about doing this? I would just use Paypal, but they or Visa seem to have blocked the ability to send money to people on Paypal. So looking for something to replace paypal.",

Make sure you send the entire amount each time as well. \n\n2)\tWhen you are ready to spend your bitcoin in your hardware wallet there are many ways to sell or spend the bitcoin very privately like loading the bitcoin up in a lightning wallet where chain analysis cannot track those UTXOs offchain. \n\nWith Chainanalytics exchanges and regulators are using probabilistic guess work in tracking transactions onchain. They merely assume your withdraw address likely belongs to you. By sending the bitcoin from wallet A to wallet B within a few hours you are creating plausible deniability and adding in significant doubt those UTXOs(bitcoin) belong to you and doing so in such a small window that the price change is moot to avoid creating a taxable event. At any time in the future you can privately spend the bitcoin or sell it for fiat in a private manner. \n\nIf you want immediate privacy than you can \n\nmany ATMs don't require ID and just sms verification - coinatmradar.com\nOther options are any way that doesn't require verification like this list -\n\nhttps://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges\n\nor you can buy bitcoin with ID and than coinjoin it \n\nOr you can buy bitcoin with ID than use a feature like https://samouraiwallet.com/ricochet\n\nOr you can buy with ID than send the btc between 2 lightning wallets \n\nAnd many more ways",
