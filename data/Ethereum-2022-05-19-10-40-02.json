So I lost my phrase, and I did not know how to get my eth with private key.. I have private address and a key, but I did not have f\\* phrase and all wallets I had installed keep asking me for f\\* phrase.. Please if someone know how to do it with private key share information with me :) Thanks a lot :)",
