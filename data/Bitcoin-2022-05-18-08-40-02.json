They wouldn't have any way of knowing and they would have no recourse, other than going back to the shop and complaining.  That won't work with a dishonest merchant.

Sounds a lot like a gift card.~~  \nIn addition to behaving like a gift card, it looks like the bolt card can also be used like a cashier's check to gift satoshis via lightning. Almost like Opendime but on lightning instead of legacy and requiring some custodial services.\n\nIf I was gifting someone satoshis, this would probably be a better option than Opendime for someone less tech savvy.  \n\nReally though, when I gift satoshis, I simply send it straight to their wallet and **skip the middlemen** because that's what the tech allows. \n\nOpendime is neat because you can keep changing hands, transferring the total value on the device, all without broadcast on-chain, similar to how cash behaves.\n\nI haven't actually used the bolt card, but from what I've read, I assume it could behave the same. How does the recipient check the balance? Would that require downloading CoinCorner's app?\n\nAlso, with Opendime, the recipient can hodl the device for years safely, but it looks like CoinCorner charges monthly fees if your account is inactive for 24 months.\n\n>If you haven't logged into your CoinCorner account for over 24 consecutive months, your account status will be deemed 'inactive'.  \nFor inactive accounts that still have a balance, we'll begin charging a \u00a310 monthly fee to cover ongoing account maintenance costs until the account reaches zero.\n\nSo as the gifter, do I have to keep the CoinCorner app and keep logging in, or does the recipient need to?\n\nAlso, it sucks I have to register an account with CoinCorner to gift satoshis. No account creation needed with Opendime.",
