Doge is a memecoin, and then theres Shibainu, and then theres King Shiba... then some random variation of dog....   \n\n\nAnd these tokens have funky tokenomics like more than 10% tax so they induce a slippery slope hostage feeling... basically red flags everywhere. Its just sad and painful to see that people who are poor and poorly educated get preyed upon by shitcoin founders whose main objective is to rug the moment they hit a certain market cap.",

Because that's really all I'm saying here.\n\nIt sounds like you think that my point is that crypto will die out at some point or that there will be a crypto winter that lasts for years. Just to be clear, that's not what I'm saying...I still hold all of my coins.\n\nMy point is that scams slow down adoption, ergo setting back the crypto industry, which is what this comment thread was about. There are literally thousands of FUD articles written about these scams, those articles turn a percentage of prospective entrants away or slow their entry to the market, ergo setting back the crypto industry's pace of growth. Businesses went bankrupt due to Luna/UST, so it's very likely that other business that are considering building around/with crypto tech & partners will reconsider their approach, timelines, or even their entry to the market altogether right now. This would set back crypto's adoption timeline as well.\n\nI don't know how to break it down any simpler for you so hopefully that makes sense. No tomatoes, I think we're just having two different conversations. Cheers",

And it seems that NFTs will largely enable this transformation.\n\nAnd not the NFTs we've seen so far with overpriced monkey-themed art pieces as vehicles for money laundering. Think games with collectible trading cards like Illuvium or getting a temporary, transferrable NFT to your hotel room that [unlocks the door](https://twitter.com/blockworks_/status/1482404012758638598) and allows access to services like the minibar. These are the more legitimate ideas that will allow crypto to expand into something bigger than its ever been.\n\nWill people continue to argue that crypto should remain decentralized and outside the purview of the law? Yes, and privacy coins like Monero will likely continue to exist regardless of regulatory oversight. But its clear that the future of crypto where it continues to see wider and wider adoption (and thus price growth) is through its more legitimate aims.",

It's not impossible (but it's not free or instant, either). TL;DR: You need a multi-component algorithm. Use arbitrage as a short-term price trimtab and use a permanent income stream to bleed excess liquidity off and to adjust the macro price. \n\nI think that crypto is an exceedingly judgey community. The attitude that everything is a shitcoin is exactly why we have so many shitcoins; it's easier to discard a broken project and fork off make a new one (which usually becomes another terrible project) than it is to fix a broken project. But the real lessons which make the community grow involve looking a hard problem in the eyes and doing the hard work to fix it.",
