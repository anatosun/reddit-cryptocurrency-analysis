My local one was using Verifone, so no dice (thankfully, was regretting the idea the moment I walked in). \n\nOff to whole foods - a quick pass by the front confirmed NCR installed. Naked Juice in hand I caught the eye of an attentive cashier. \n\nMe: \"I know it was just announced but do you know if lightning is enabled?\"\n\nCashier: \"like a phone pay?\"\n\nMe: \"kind of, you can pay with cash app and the like but it uses the bitcoin network to send lightning invoice and converts my dollars or bitcoin or whatever I paid with to dollars for you\"\n\nCashier #2 comes over: \"people have been asking about that so hopefully next week\"\n\nC1: \"wow that's a really good idea\"\n\nMe: \"see you next week!\"\n\nWasn't expecting much the first hour, and I was glad to spark their curiosity.",

The Apple Pay user would scan the lightning invoice and Strikes API would turn their dollars into sats which would then be sent through the lightning network to the recipient.\n\nRight now Apple Pay users can only pay Visa and Mastercard point of sale terminals but with this integration Apple Pay users would be able to scan and pay any person merchant or bill on earth that uses a lightning invoice. This would mean an Apple Pay user who knows nothing about bitcoin could travel to El Salvador where everyone accepts lightning payments and they could pay for their goods and services by scanning a lightning invoice using their Apple Pay app.\n\nThis would make it so someone with absolutely no bank account selling food on the side of the road in El Salvador could accept payment from a tourist who uses Apple Pay. Think about that for a second. A person with absolutely no banking services and nothing but a $10 phone would be able to accept payment from a tourist that has nothing but a credit card.\n\nNow that is what I call real financial innovation! I really hope this is what Jack Mallers will announce in 5 days time at the Miami Conference!",
