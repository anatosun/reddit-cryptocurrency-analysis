            "selftext": "I work in finance, and can tell you, it is incredibly frustrating going to /r/personalfinance and giving advice to people that just want to sit around smelling their own farts. That is a place where people are supposed to know what they are talking about, and practically everyone there thinks that finance, means budgeting. \n\nFinancing has been around for thousands of years, and yet people have very little basic knowledge about even the concept of money, let alone the cost of it. \n\nIt gets so bad that I can't help but to sit there and say that it feels like I'm \"early\" to the concept of interest rates. When in reality, the stupidity of the people are what the central planners are counting on. They aren't hiding their theft from regular people, they are just operating out of another dimension.\n\nI wonder if Bitcoin will suffer eternally due to the people that it benefits, having no real interest in learning why or how, and the people that do understand it, all have much more to gain from gaming the system.\n\nRant over. This will likely be seen by 4 people, but I needed to get it off my chest.",

Either because of the fact that if you have a dumb opinion already formulated in your head that thing is like calcified, so there's a resistance and if someone tries to break your bubble you try to reject it harshly since that person is breaking your whole reality in a sense, since all your life decisions and things you think you know were acquired using the same logic so then it might mean you are deceived in most things you think you know and that's hard to swallow for many.\n\nOr even sometimes you will explain why what they are saying is nonsense and usually when it's in a group that people look up to you as a cultured person they will actually seem to listen and you think you educated them. Only to realize in another occasion that they are saying the same thing they were as if you explained nothing...\n\nSo in the end most conversations are left to fools amongst themselves and they just walk in circles because there's in fact, probably nothing anyone can do. You either truly break away from all the dumbness and start to learn by yourself or no matter what anyone says to you you will still be dumb because you will not listen because you don't even know how to listen.",

As swings get softer more will accept it as a valid investment.  Will everyone understand it? No, most people don't understand anything, but I don't think its necessarily necessary.  Here's a short story of bitcoins potential use case.\n\nI just bought a house.  A week before closing, the house appraised lower than estimated and due to the conditions of a VA loan they had to rewrite my mortgage.  This immediately cancelled the deal I had cut, to roll the ~$13,000 closing costs into the mortgage; instead of receiving $4000 back now I'd owe about $10,000.  This is a swing in liquidity requirements that I was not financially prepared to eat, I didn't keep enough in my bank account to cover it and nearly lost the whole deal.\n\nThe complexity of solving this was not something I had the power to solve, I had money on the stock market but it would have taken 5 days for an ACH transfer between my stock broker and bank to cover.  If Schwab and navy federal both held bitcoin as a tradable reserve asset, then theoretically they could have used bitcoin to facilitate the transaction and my account would have settled in 30 minutes.\n\nInstead, I had to eat a loss of ~40 basis points on my loan, raising my mortgage payments by several hundred a month.  This type of financial inefficiency is a challenge for every large institution, and it will be difficult to ignore.  Banks, like jpmorgan chase just has, will want to reorganize their reserve asset portfolio to take this into account.\n\nI'm not sure who can \"game\" this, aside from traders who are good at identifying where we are on the cycle, buying and selling for profit.  All bitcoin needs to do is remain a neutral money, not favoring one group or another.",

So it\u2019s not a true investment, and it\u2019s not a true currency\u2026\u2026.it may become such, but at the moment it has no widely accepted value. I have some so hopefully it explodes someday, but currently I\u2019m down, which means I\u2019d be forced to use it or sell it at a loss, which means it\u2019s essentially worthless to me, just a placeholder on my books. It in its current state is providing absolutely no value to me\u2026\u2026.maybe it will go up and I\u2019ll sell it. But that\u2019s about where it\u2019s value ends for the average user.",
