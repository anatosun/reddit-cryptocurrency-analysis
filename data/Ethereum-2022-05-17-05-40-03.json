Things like incentivized liquidity for founder exits, out-of-control inflation, character max-use limits, and token pre-sales when there's no product/game yet - all of these can be harmful to users.\n\nMy latest project has been to break down top crypto play to earn games so that you can visualize what the return-on-investment is if you're spending your hard-earned money to play. You can see:\n\n* Minimum Investment required\n* Earnings per day\n* Return on investment (in days)\n* Optimal strategy\n* How-to-play guide\n* Token price\n\n[**FORTHEPLAYERS.gg**](https://fortheplayers.gg/)\n\nI made the calculators with a knowledgable game researcher and the game communities themselves. The calculators are **updated every 10 min using the latest token and NFT prices.** Here's an example of one that we made- [Link to Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SNG3DFxo9s7VLYu4XwtbjsGRWzE2U7T1mCxzhh1t1jw/edit#gid=406151422). We've played all these games ourselves to make sure our information is solid.\n\nThanks for checking it out! Is there something that's missing? Is there a game you'd like to see listed? Let me know in the comments.",

This could have been prevented by the team, but doesn't sgnal 'SCAM' to me. It just sounds like the mechanism that it was all built upon wasn't enough to secure the peg.",

New money was constantly required in order for ust to keep the peg.\n\nForthermore it created an \"infinite money\" loop, where minting ust drove price of luna up, even though it should drive it down. Selling one billion dollars worth of luna? Tanks price because of market forces. Convert it to a stable coin and so the same? No down force, because its \"stable\". \n\nFor these reasons it was a ponzi scheme. It only works when new capital flows in. It stops to function completely. Ust stable at 1 dollar was the function.\n\nAnchor was run by the same people to keep people in the scheme. To call it separate is to excuse these scammers.\n\nI've been calling it a ponzi and warned about its collapse for months.\n\nThis was a scam. It had smoke and mirrors that apparently still fool some. But it was always a scam by all accounts.\n\nStop excusing the people behind luna.",
