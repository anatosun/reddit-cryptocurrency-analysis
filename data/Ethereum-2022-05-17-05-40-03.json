Things like incentivized liquidity for founder exits, out-of-control inflation, character max-use limits, and token pre-sales when there's no product/game yet - all of these can be harmful to users.\n\nMy latest project has been to break down top crypto play to earn games so that you can visualize what the return-on-investment is if you're spending your hard-earned money to play. You can see:\n\n* Minimum Investment required\n* Earnings per day\n* Return on investment (in days)\n* Optimal strategy\n* How-to-play guide\n* Token price\n\n[**FORTHEPLAYERS.gg**](https://fortheplayers.gg/)\n\nI made the calculators with a knowledgable game researcher and the game communities themselves. The calculators are **updated every 10 min using the latest token and NFT prices.** Here's an example of one that we made- [Link to Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SNG3DFxo9s7VLYu4XwtbjsGRWzE2U7T1mCxzhh1t1jw/edit#gid=406151422). We've played all these games ourselves to make sure our information is solid.\n\nThanks for checking it out! Is there something that's missing? Is there a game you'd like to see listed? Let me know in the comments.",

The way it keeps to $1 is by allowing people to buy UST at $0.99 or lower and sell at \u00a31.00 or higher for profit\n\nThe idea is that price fluctuations don't last long because someone will buy when UST is below $1 (pushing the price back up to $1), and sell when UST is worth over $1 (pushing the price back down to $1)\n\nThis would technically stabilise the value at about $1 on average. But this also means the following: *You get higher profits when the value of 1 UST is far away from $1*\n\nYou can crash the price down by constantly selling, and buy back in at $0.01 in order to make a bigger profit when UST goes back to $1... But if everyone is selling to push the price down (causing the value to crash)... How will the value of 1 UST recover back to $1? In short, it doesn't. That's the death spiral.\n\n*\"This feature is where the problem lies: the bond investor might sell some stock short in order to hedge the bond, but this would push down the stock price, meaning that the bond holder is now guaranteed more stock upon conversion, so they then sell even more stock short. this cycle continues on, until the stock price hits zero\" -*  [Patrick Boyle again](https://youtu.be/iisPX_xVMV8)",

That's what happens when nothing in the entire system has established itself as money except for stablecoins\u2014*Gresham's Law*. And when you design something so foolishly that several coins-tokens-scams travel on the base layer along with the gas token ETH, you get an orgy of swaps, wraps, burns, mints and stakes run by dapps that do nothing but optimize token interactions to keep the orgy going. A collateralized scam, dipshit.",
