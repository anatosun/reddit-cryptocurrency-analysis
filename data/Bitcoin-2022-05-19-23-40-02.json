It was a bit naive to think a discussion with the Buttcoiners would have a positive outcome.\n\nWell... it ended in an endless discussion which ultimately ended in kind of personal attacks.\n\nNow I feel kind of sad and can honestly not understand why people over there think they are so reflected and know what they are talking about. I can understand that it like two opposites coming together, but am I really so blind to not understand what they are hating about? It feels like for them everything related to \"blockchain\" is the same. Bitcoin is the biggest scam and a disease. Everyone is a \"moonboy\".\n\nPlease see the tragedy at: https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/usuvvf/hahah_hahahahahahahaha/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nPlease be so kind to not put more hat on me if you think I am too tearful here. I am already confused with a bitter feeling of \"internet hate discussion\".\nI would be happy to see your personal point of view on this dynamics.",

It will help you better understand what buttcoin is about.\n\n\"Yes, I've followed for years, I find it fascinating, it's so obvious that at the core is bitterness of having missed out in some way. Bitcoin and crypto are voluntary networks, you choose to participate and if not just ignore it.\n\nI've never liked football, I kind of hate it. I cant imagine joining a community of other football haters to talk daily, comment, and make content. In order to keep up I have to watch football matches, keep up to date with the scores, read the latest football news. And talk about it with my fellow football haters, all the while believing (wishing) that world will wake up and realize how stupid football is and it will eventually go away to zero.\"",

They are fucked up, as in, mentally ill.  \n\nThey'll give dangerous advice in a fitness discussion, hoping to encourage a stranger to physically harm themself.  That is sick.  \n\nSame thing for nutrition, medical advice.  \n\nThey'll use any opportunity to hurt someone's feelings.  Or, they'll try to get somebody to become upset, frustrated, angry.  \n\nThey also like to try to get people to do things to harm themself financially.    \n\nThey'll lie, lie, lie.  You can catch them in their lies, they really won't care.  \n\nRemember: those people are mentally ill.  They almost certainly have brain damage from blunt force trauma - somebody hit them in the head when they were little, or they had an accident - or they've damaged their brains with drugs toxic chemicals.  Feel bad for them.  If you could see the scars on their brains, you'd feel bad for them.  Be glad you're not somehow related to them, or that they're not your boss or coworker or neighbor.  Be glad you're not one of them.  \n\nI've discovered ways to make them upset, but it's not worth the time.  And, if you really get under their skin and you ever get doxxed, you could find yourself in physical danger.  And if they know/think you have Bitcoin, even worse.  \n\nBest thing is to learn to routinely be happy for everything.  Be happy for nice, warm, sunny days.  Be glad for cold, stormy days.  Lots of things happen to us - look for the lessons.  I like to go for a walk in the evening/afternoon and ask, \"What did I learn?\"",

Most members act like they know everything and are 100% certain that bitcoin will fail. The sub has existed for ELEVEN years. Let that sink in a bit. Bitcoin traded at sub $10. They\u2019ve been screaming about it\u2019s inevitable failure for that long. They pay no mind to the adoption and development of the infrastructure for usage of cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, nor the rapid attraction of investment money into the space. Many are still stuck on the \u201ccriminal\u201d use rhetoric of 7 years ago. It\u2019s a boring, tired, and sad sub of scared fools who mostly are bitter because they\u2019ve wasted away opportunity on the sidelines playing it safe. They refuse to admit that while bitcoin and blockchain are highly speculative, and very much still in a proof of concept phase of adoption, that they could be wrong. How could they be wrong? Because unfortunately for them, no matter how much they scream, the more people that choose to take a chance on bitcoin, the harder it will be to unravel its existence. The future is unknown, bitcoin certainly could fail, but the past eleven years have shown that sub is truly a haven for sore losers.",

It was the US dollar\u2019s system that did it to me. Once I learned what the system was and how it functioned, I could no longer value anything in dollars after realizing how fast they were exponentially losing value.  \n>  \n>The US dollar is a system that is burning up its own value with every new dollar that is digitally issued and shoved into the bank accounts of the top 1% of the world. It is shoved into their accounts whenever they need to get a new bank bailout loan or corporate bond loan.  \n>  \n>They then take that new money and freeze it into their own portfolio\u2019s asset holdings. Jumping ship from the dollar while the loan/money printing process that got them those dollars, melts away the buying power of everyone else\u2019s US Dollar savings.  \n>  \n>This process leaves almost none of that newly printed money liquidity to trickle down to those at the bottom that are relying on the dollar.  \n>  \n>Dollars that are perpetually being devalued thanks to the digital printing of trillions of new dollars, trillions of new dollars that are issued through loans acquired by the top 1% for their asset hoarding greed.",
