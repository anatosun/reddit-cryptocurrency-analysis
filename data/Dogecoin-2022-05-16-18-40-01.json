The world didn\u2019t adopt it as quickly as everyone thought they would. People began to lose interest so the people that were invested panicked. The fear that it wouldn\u2019t actually see mass adoption set in and they all sold. It completely crashed. Few survived the crash while the majority died.\n\nA couple years later, Amazon, eBay, google\u2026. They were still there when the adoption happened. But the adoption happened FAST. It was like the entire world adopted over night. The ones that truly thrived were the investors that continued to accrue during the long bear market. \n\nThe mindset of the world around crypto is identical, not just the charts. You will see everyone lose interest, we already are. And that will last for a couple years. But then\u2026 then we will have the next bitcoin halving, and that will spark the interest again as we see values rise again. That will in turn spark mass adoption in my opinion. \n\nMandatory this is not financial advice disclaimer. \n\nI currently have 16k doge, along with some bitcoin and ethereum. I personally will continue to accrue every dime I can spare over the next 2 years while everyone gives up. Just with the internet, this really is the future",
