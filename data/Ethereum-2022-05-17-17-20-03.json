PoS/Matic is a side chain that is completely separate to the Ethereum network, whereas Nightfall is a ZK rollup that settles its transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nThis settlement requires Nightfall to pay for gas, which means that it directly benefits Ethereum users and ETH holders, as ETH *has* to be used to pay for that gas, ever since EIP1559 was introduced. Nightfall may allow users to pay for in-rollup fees using MATIC or some other token (though this is unlikely for the reason that AESTHTK outlined), but it'll have to convert back to ETH regardless.",
