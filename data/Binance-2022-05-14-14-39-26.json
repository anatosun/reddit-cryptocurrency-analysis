You take your $100 USDC and buy 200 UST. You then turn straight around and sell 200 UST for $1 each of LUNA (because the LUNA/UST is still artificially pegged to $1 USD even though the wider market for the UST peg has crashed). \n\nSo, if LUNA is trading at $0.02 and you sell the 200 UST = 10,000 LUNA. \n\nThen you turn straight around on a DEX (automatic market maker so your trading against a liquidity pool and don't need a buyer for your sell trade) and you sell the 10,000 LUNA @ $0.018 for USDT = $180. \n\nSo, $80 profit from $100 invested and this creates a constant selling pressure of LUNA as the artificial $1 peg is maintained between LUNA and UST. \n\nThis is nothing more then a version of algorithmic trading where a miss match in market pricing is found and exploited. All the above could be automated by anyone with algorithms/bots already in place for other needs, just redeploy them on the fly to exploit the irregularity. \n\nThen wash, rinse and repeat and it's a free money glitch as long as trading of LUNA and UST remain open and it creates constant sell pressure and the value of LUNA keeps tanking.\n\nThe fundamental flaw with algorithmic stablecoins structured like LUNA/UST is that it works as a stablecoin just fine while the market sentiment TRUSTS it to work.... Where it becomes INHERENTLY unstable is when market sentiment DOESN'T trust it and there is a \"bank run\" as people bail out of UST. That then creates a situation where the mechanism used to stabilise the UST peg can be exploited by arbitrage trading and it creates a death spiral as the minting mechanism constantly attempts to regain the stablecoin peg but that in turn just incentives arbitrage trading even more and the selling of LUNA.",

BNB has dipped into the $253 to $308 demand zone, halting the slide for the time being. A collapse is likely as purchasers fail to keep up with the general selling pressure.\n\nIf the Binance Coin price closes below $253 in three days, it will signal a breakout and a 13 percent drop to the immediate support level of $222. To collect liquidity, the price action will most likely sweep below this barrier. \n\nWhile bears may find some relief here, the downswing might continue to the next support level at $182. This fall would result in a total loss of 34% from the current position. \n\nGiven that the Bitcoin price has not gathered liquidity while resting below the January 2021 lows, the bearish forecast is likely to play out.\n\nThings could be different if the Binance Coin price manages to recover off the $253 to $308 demand zone. The bearish thesis will be invalidated if the market recovers and closes above $336 in three days. \n\nIn this circumstance, the Binance Coin price may rise in order to accumulate liquidity above the equal highs of $413 and $432. Binance Coin is the flagship of the Binance platform which is the largest in the world and the trading place of cryptocurrencies including play to earn game utilities like Quint, Decentraland, Axie Infinity and so on.",

You have traders who think this is still viable so rush to jump back in, you have scalpers just day trading it and you have bag holders buying in again to try and average down. \n\nKnow this for a fact, the project and this token are dead in its current format. Do Kwon is already talking about a snapshot and reissue of coins and remove the huge supply created. Anyone buying in now will NOT be included in that snapshot! \n\nIf your trading this, keep up with news as its likely to be delisted at a moments notice! \n\nLiterally only put play money into it that you can laugh about if it disappears! \n\nThere will be a airdop of a new coin, new name to try distance itself from the memory of this clusterfuck. It will initially have some legs (old holders buying back in hoping it will pump like LUNA did) but then slowly drop off as not enough new money comes in. Smart money will sell off into this initial demand and exit, the project will wallow on for 6-12mths before everyone wakes up to the fact it's tarnished forever by the wider market sentiment about what happened to LUNA/UST and eventually it will be called and holders will be paid out a pro rata amount of the treasury assets (cents of the $). \n\nProjects that go through what LUNA just did.... NEVER recover! They are forever stained in the minds of traders who will never really trust it again. \n\nBE WARNED!\n\nEDIT: Full disclosure, I'm day trading/scalping it with play money. But please, if your going to trade it, understand the fuckin RISKS and have your finger on the exit button!",

Solana just had a horrible hack in March and it is still ticking, the difference is Solana was not attacked by an institution. I hope people realize the amount of money it took to make Luna crash. I am very pleased actually to see Do Kwon fighting back, he knows he is in a war and is moving accordingly now that shots have been fired. If the same amount of money was used to strategically attack Solana in March chances are the same outcome would have happened and honestly I can\u2019t see how Solana is around in 10yrs without some major upgrades.",

            "selftext": "Crypto asset markets have continued to fall this week, plummeting to their lowest levels of the year, but what is driving the bearish price action?\n\nThe total value of the cryptocurrency market has dropped to its lowest level in ten months. Over the weekend, another $130 billion left the space, bringing the market cap down to $1.62 trillion. According to CoinGecko, it has not been this low since early August.\n\nBTC, ETH, LUNA, TVK, Etc; led losses again during the Monday morning Asian trading session, which was their lowest since January. Crypto markets are cyclical, but there are a few other factors driving the current selloff, Like;\n\n- The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by half a percentage point last week, prompting a stock market crash. Crypto markets have followed suit, losing more than 10%, or nearly $200 billion, in the last week.\n\n- The year 2021 was extremely bullish for institutional crypto investment, but that trend has not continued into 2022. Tesla, MicroStrategy, El Salvador, and several payment platforms entered the crypto market, fueling the momentum and buying pressure. The first Bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds were allowed to trade in the United States, which was also encouraging. This year has been much more subdued, with institutional crypto fund outflows occurring four weeks in a row, according to CoinShares.\n\nFinally, cryptocurrency markets are cyclical; what rises must fall. Since Bitcoin's inception more than a decade ago, there have been four distinct bull/bear markets. If previous cycles are any guide, crypto markets may remain bearish until the end of the year and into 2023 before turning around.",

I have no position regarding UST or Luna, just so you know.\n\nTerra's HQ locates in Singapore but could simply be a paper company, right? I am certainly not that familiar with legal terms but it definitely looks like @stablekwon has disbanded his firm in Korea.\n\nHere is the screenshot from the Korean registry office. https://imgur.com/gallery/FokGFnO\n\nIt seems like @stablekwon has already filed the dissolution of the corporation. Terraform labs Korea no longer exists.\n\nOverall, all this definitely looks like a Ponzi scheme, and our fellow @stablekwon may soon become a notable fugitive.",

LUNA can no longer mint/burn, so temporarily UST will no longer suffer from further inflation.\n\nCurrently, Luna can't mint anymore, so UST holders don't have a cashout line for $1, if they want to exit, there is only a cut loss line through the UST/BUSD pair on Binance. And those who panic sell already did it yesterday. The person who cut loss will decrease gradually.\n\n[https://agora.terra.money/t/terra-ecosystem-revival-plan/8701](https://agora.terra.money/t/terra-ecosystem-revival-plan/8701)\n\nIn this article, Do Kwon proposes to [distribute 40%](https://cryptowallcity.com/do-kwon-officially-spoke-terra-restoration-plan/) of the total supply of Luna v2 to UST holders. The demand from here will support the amount of UST of those who want to cut loss.\n\nBesides, whale teams (exchanges, funds) are holding a lot of UST. Many traditional ecosystems around the world have put UST in circulation and used as a payment instrument.\n\nSaving UST is saving the pockets of whales and these ecosystems.\n\nCurrently, the price of UST is 0.15, my view is that UST will gradually go back to level 1.\n\n**Note**: this is a personal opinion, if anyone follows this statement and makes an investment decision, remember it is absolutely your money.
