I\u2019m looking to liquidate a large portion of it to invest into stable stocks/index funds etc. How do I go about getting the money from blockchain wallets to my bank account, is it taxed immediately or do i file it later on? I have withdrawn around $50,000 worth at once from coinbase but i included the figure in title because I imagined taking out that much would have different rules. I do not have a high income, is my bank/IRS going to have a panic attack when i withdraw nearly a million dollars to my account out of nowhere?",

Long term capital gains will be 20% on nearly half of that (all gains over ~$450k) assuming your cost basis was in the thousands and not hundreds of thousands. And then it'll be about 15% on everything under ~$450k, plus 5-10% for state depending on where you live. \n\n>How do I go about getting the money from blockchain wallets to my bank account, is it taxed immediately or do i file it later on?\n\nYou would use an exchange like Gemini, Binance, etc and place a Sell order at a certain price the same way as a stock market. It will not be taxed immediately and you will file it in your 2021 tax return (assuming you're in US) next year. \n\n>I do not have a high income, is my bank/IRS going to have a panic attack when i withdraw nearly a million dollars to my account out of nowhere?\n\nYes and no.. This is the part you'll want to hire the CPA for, and I'd recommend having someone help you on your 2022 taxes as well, as you will likely have to file your returns quarterly for the year instead of all at the end of 2022 (The IRS having a panic attack). Your income for 2021 will become nearly a million dollars which will put you and your family in a higher tax bracket than you were previously. \n\nBut yeah, like the others have said, a good accountant will give you great suggestions on how and when to move your money around to minimize capital gains taxes. \n\nAll I'll say to close on is that once you've spoken with a CPA, consider the cost of your strategy here. Decide if the volatility of bitcoin is too scary for you to the point that you'd be willing to pay over a hundred thousand dollars just to have it in another investment vehicle. There are reports even from financial firms that have BTC price targets of over $100k. I'm *certainly* not giving you any financial advice here but just recognize that the cost of moving this much money out of any investment vehicle is very high, and it is always more profitable to put off paying taxes until a later date. That being said, Biden's new capital gains tax plan will be hitting $1mm+ earners with a 40% gains tax soon, so be smart with your investments. If you're reinvesting the full amount somewhere else, plan to either eat a 40% tax or leave it in there for 4-8 years or longer depending on whether or not Republicans take office back any time soon.",

Estate management and wealth management are absolutely different but leaving money on the table is not smart regardless of the situation. Like I said I'm not trying to provide any investment advice whatsoever because you and I both know nothing of OPs situation. For me personally, if I were, say, a 30 year old with this money it doesn't make a lot of sense to me to move this into other investment vehicles as a giant lump sum. Again for me personally even if I were closer to 50 and had the time but still wanted to pull the money out for retirement early, for me it would be wiser to realize <450k gains each year over 2 years in most cases to save yourself the potential 5-20% (depending on when Biden plans to begin enforcing the new tax plan) as well as to continue having money in a rapid growth investment for another year. Win win of letting half your money continue earning moderate interest in safe low risk investments while still keeping some in more volatile investments with a LOT of growth projected for the next year.\n\nBut once again, not investment advice. I'm not saying that as a meme, I'm saying that because it's my personal investment ideas and everyone has different needs, goals, and money.",

That said, you can always look up & read the tax code for free & familiarize yourself with other financial products, but that takes time & there's a chance  you misinterpret tax code.  There's a reason why CPA's make a good living, they specialize in knowing & understanding something that most people do not.",

You should hire a CPA. And also consider taking out a loan against the btc instead so you don\u2019t have to sell, that shit is only going to get more valuable.\n\nCan you outline the taking out a loan part / strategy. I agree that I personally wouldn't be selling, but I get the feeling whales are using Dexes to their own benefit and wondering how a loan against a holding would be advantageous (I imagine its because you get to realize the monetary benefit and the loan repayments would be dwarfed by any further growth in the price of crypto assets is that correct? are there any tax benefits?)",

Once it settles back down another 10k or so, and if it then stays stable, I think we can start talking in more certain terms, at that point.",

OP is deciding to put his money in index funds thats the alternative we are talking about. Passive investing could very well underperform inflation and thats why QQQ, Ark Invest and Bitcoin are doing so well because everybody is racing for growth/yield to beat expanding money supply. \n\nBitcoin is asymmetric upside because its an emerging asset class where institutions can't front run the trade. If you think bitcoin is overvalued now you have not done your homework on glassnode or cryptoquark. On chain analysis is strong right now. Could bitcoin go down a couple K, yeah for sure. Would I trade out of bitcoin, fuck now. \n\n  \nI dont know how its become fashionable to encourage people to trade out of bitcoin on here. I understand that you dont want bitcoin to become this religiously devoted cult but can we at least understand what we are talking about here. If you dont think bitcoin has a good chance of overtaking gold as store of value in the next 4-5 years why even post here? That would be peanuts compared to past performance by the way. Would I advise someone to trade out of bitcoin for index funds? fuck no, and definitely not on the basis of safety or prudence, look at m2 money supply charts on FRED and tell me anything is safe, this is unprecedented times, any asset class that is considered safe is a naive illusion. \n\nLets do the math, if bitcoin does steal half of golds market cap, thats a 5x thats  $3.75m. Not a certainty but nothing is a certainty, its merely just a continuation of one of the best performing assets in our lifetime in an extremely friendly macro climate. I would have a hard time living with myself giving up that kind of money to buy into a passive investing bubble that completely contradicts the thesis of bitcoin. \n\nIndex funds are not created to be safe-Stock market is not intended to prop up retirement accounts. Stock market purpose is to allocate capital to under invested companies. This has created a huge misallocation into indexed companies and created a bubble ripe for bitcoin to steal value indirectly. Real estate, negative yielding bonds, passive etfs/index funds are ripe to get raped by Bitcoin as they have been operating as vastly inferior stores of value. \n\nr/bitcoin has become a laughing stock in bitcoin discourse because of this lack of awareness. Encourage someone to buying index funds is completely contradictory to bitcoin thesis.

If you only ever bought one batch of BTC in 2013 and now it\u2019s worth $750k, that\u2019ll be easy to calculate, but be warned, it means almost all that money will be up for some aggressive taxing.\n3. If you bought in MANY batches over the years and sold at different times, uhhh calculating all of that unless you kept excellent notes is going to suck. If you\u2019ve been on coin base the whole time then they keep good records and it should be ok.\n4. IMPORTANT - we have a PROFRESSIVE tax in the US; incremental amounts of income are taxed differently. It\u2019s not, for example, your yearly income taxed at say percent like 30%. You can find estimate calculators online.\n5. IMPORTANT - Given #4, you can look up the tax brackets for 2021... if you go cash out all Bitcoin at once, that will push you into highest tax bracket immediately and everything above 250 or 300k is taxed at 39%. Look up the brackets I forgot exactly. My brackets were pretty off, here are the brackets - https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/tax-brackets/602222/what-are-the-income-tax-brackets-for-2021-vs-2020\n6. IMPORTANT - Because of #5, and you said you are low income, if you instead liquidated your Bitcoin over the next 4 years in chunks, being careful to keep yourself in the 20-something tax bracket, you could potentially save yourself $100k or more in taxes versus cashing it all at once.",

Before the $50,000 comment you said, \u201cHow do I go about getting the money from blockchain wallets (you have more than one?) to my bank account\u201d Then in the following sentence you say you moved Bitcoin from Coinbase to I assume your bank account. So help me out here, why the contradictions? Did your bank \u201chave a panic attack\u201d on the $50,000? Apparently not, so why think they would on a higher amount? As you would have learned, banks KNOW where the money came from, also the IRS were notified the day you deposited the $50,000, did they contact you, any men in suits knock on your door? No they did not. So relax. Now the good news setting aside the contradictory statements, if you made under $40,000 and you are single, you can cash in a million in Bitcoin and you will pay 0% taxes on it. Now that was the tax rule on long term (held over a year) capital  gains in 2020 (you can thank President Trump for it) I assume the same rule will apply for 2021, but you better act before the current administration changes this. As I am sure everyone on this tread is aware the IRS 1040 form includes a question about virtual currencies on the front page asking taxpayers if \u201cat any time during 2020, did [they] receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency? If you made over $40,000 up to something around $400,000 the tax on long term capital gains is 15%. Hopefully when you said you did not have a high income you meant under $40,000 or if you are married it\u2019s higher, not sure how much. If you make more than $40,000 and do not want to pay over a $112,000 to the government then consider a self-directed Roth IRA to shelter your cryptocurrency profits from capital gains taxes and income taxes. Self-directed IRA\u2019s give you more flexibility in that you can expand your investments beyond those approved by a custodian (like Fidelity or Vanguard, etc.) to encompass a much wider range of options including real estate, precious metals, etc. There are other options but that\u2019s enough for now.

Maybe they would allow you to borrow something like $250k (wild guess). They would send you cash and make you keep your coins on the exchange. If the price dropped 50%, they would tell you to either put more collateral forward, or be liquidated. If you don't put more in, they sell your coins for $250k, get their money back, and you have nothing (except the remaining cash). \n\nOf course it would be great if the price went up, because now you'd get the best of both worlds, same number of coins at a higher value, plus cash, but we are leveraging here. If you invest borrowed money (which effectively, you are doing), your risks are magnified as well as your reward. It cannot be the right strategy in OPs case where he is looking to reduce risk (unleveraged BTC is risky enough). Plus it also comes with interest costs, which are a guaranteed loss",

Some of these exchanges trade in fiat currencies and allow you to link your bank account so you can withdraw directly. However, to increase withdrawal limits to a range adequate for large amounts of bitcoin you must provide personal information, which compromises anonymity. Slippage can also be an issue when cashing in on-exchange. (Some people divide their holdings between multiple exchanges to bypass daily limits. For example splitting between Coinbase, Kraken, and Netcoins (shameless plug).\n* **Off-exchange:** this type of trading happens directly between two people. There are two slight variations of this method: One is to trade with an over-the-counter (OTC) broker and the other one is peer-to-peer (p2p) trading. In both cases, you would be trading directly with a person. The difference is that the former is a professional crypto trader, while the latter is not. Off-exchange trading allows greater levels of anonymity, but you must be very careful who you trade with. The same anonymity that protects you also offers a layer of protection to scammers who may be after your bitcoin.\n\nAnd of course, it is always recommended to discuss your options with an accountant/lawyer (who understands crypto tax laws), to make sure you are safe and take advantage of all options available to you.",

If prices go up like predicted and lets say one BTC is 1 million USD. How would you cash out without raising any red flags? Mentioned a few times in this thread is that amounts higher than USD 10k would alarm the banks. But if I want to sell like 0,5 BTC which is maybe USD 500k then, how would I transfer this to my pocket? Currently I buy via Kraken and can also sell there. But I would never transfer too much to my bank account, not to make the IRS investigate on me. Because I know, those guys will come after me immediately if I do so. \n\nCash out via a BTC cash terminal? The fees will probably kill me.\nTransfer small amounts to my bank account via another bank account abroad? (cashing out to the other account and then transferring small unsuspicious amounts to my personal account)\nCash out to Paypal and transfer small amounts to my personal bank account?\n\nI would NOT like to have financial advisor to be involved here.\n\nHow is your strategy?",

Since you want to take some money off the table now, sell some of your btc on Coinbase Pro and send the money to your bank.  Next year, when the time comes to calculate the capital gains for your 2021 tax return, you will need records of your purchase amounts and prices, and your sell amounts and prices.  I've been doing my own btc taxes for years without any help from an accountant.  I import my transaction records from the exchange where I buy and sell (in my case, I use Coinbase) into tax software.  I prefer bitcoin(dot)tax, you can use whichever tax software your prefer but it's best to use one that can import data directly from your exchange.  And the reason I say this is because capital gains calculations get very complicated very quickly, especially if you've made lots of transactions.  Let tax software do the calculation for you.   After you import your exchange data and run it through tax software, you will take the resulting Form 8949 and enter it on Schedule D of your 1040.  Note:  if you did all your buying and selling on Coinbase, you only need to import Coinbase data; but if you bought some of your coins on a different exchange, you're also going to need to import the data from that exchange.  You need the records of \\*all\\* your past transactions.  If your profit-taking this year involves selling coins you bought in 2013, you will have to import tx info from 2013 and any other years you made trades.  If there are transactions you don't have  a record of, like in-person cash buys, just put down whatever you remember or estimate the amounts and prices as well as you can.  From your post I'm assuming you will actually have an accountant do your taxes, but you really need to know how it all works, seriously everybody who realizes capital gains needs to know this stuff.  As for scaring the IRS with big money transfers, I'd say they're just going to be glad to take your tax money.  Dot your I's and cross your T's at tax time and you'll have no trouble.  Hiring a good accountant is an insurance policy in that regard.",
