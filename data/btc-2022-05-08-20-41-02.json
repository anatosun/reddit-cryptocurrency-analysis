With LN you need to take your BTC, pay an onchain fee to turn it into LN, pay the LN fee, then pay the on-chain fee to turn it back into BTC (on the Muun wallet, for example.) The fee to swap between BCH/BTC on Coinbase Pro is lower then that (I believe!)",

Even after we've educated you about forks and shitcoins, you still continue attempting to trick users by commenting that altcoins are different from shitcoins and that shitcoin that fork off from bitcoin are good. Perhaps we should start removing all of your garbage comments since you're already accusing us of it?\"\n\nso i made this reply to the unknown mod:\n\n\"ok i appreciate it if you guys dont ghost my comments away anymore\n\nbut you know if 2 things are different then they cannot have the same name so thats why altcoins are not shitcoins and as you can see from the cdc gov link crypto makes you go to the bathroom lots lol so thats why crypto means shitcoins..ok perfect but the difference between a shitcoin and a altcoin is that the shitcoin was premined and a altoin there is no premine because when you fork from bitcoin you take a copy from the ledger and then go from there so theres no premining of coins..but even if you did alter the ledger it would still be a altcoin because alt stands for alternative version of bitcoin the first ledger ever and the fairest start ever\n\ntrue none of this stuff is written in stone yet so maybe you think this is a battle of opinions..but if you ghost away my comments about this then thats simply not cool\n\nalso i wouldnt care about this actually cept its important when u understand that forks from bitcoin are important for bitcoin to survive..cuz forks from bitcoin are like feelers for what bitcoin can do and like a true test in the real world\n\nsome here seem to want bitcoin to 'ossify' but i dont ..i think bitcoin can do everything and that why we need bitcoin to be able to use its forking abilities for many things that most here are not aware of yet it seems\n\nyes its complicated..but so are many things in life..such as how can bitcoin escape the paper i.o.u's(back to trust) and bitcoin is meant to be trustless..so the 2 clash..and if trust wins then bitcoin loses..we dont want that right?\n\nso if we encourage a bitcoin eco_system where people fork from bitcoin for the ideas rather than what they are doing now which is to premine for the ideas then that means bitcoin can escape the paper i.o.u's of trust because custodians will have to do proof of reserves and keep everyones bitcoin seperate in order to be able to hand out whatever fork that customer wants if say they want to trade it or spend it etc\n\nso if we call forks from bitcoin shitcoins then it steers everyone actually towards the real shitcoins and not towards building a bitcoin eco-system that does the job of all of the shitcoins but better for everyone that holds real bitcoin(no premines remember)..and thats how bitcoin gets to a mil. and more is cuz then bitcoin does \"everything\"\n\nbcash for example was just an idea that turns out the people dont want..but bcash was trying to be a better bitcoin so thats a bold move but the people decided and the only ones that lost out were the ones that wantd the bcash idea and then put their money into that..but really average joe dont have to be concerned cuz they will have both..but bitcoin is so huge now that to try to be a better bitcoin is very small chance to do that so most forking will be just for ideas...and if any of those ideas becomes popular then bitcoin can consider to adopt it into itslef if it was wanted but that would be judging by how popular the fork was and if it was becoming a threat to the real bitcoin...thats true democracy by the masses\n\nforking from bitcoin is an ability of bitcoin itself..a true way to upgrade chosen by the masses\n\nhope this explains it more\"\n\nthen got this reply:\n\n\"Nobody is \"ghosting\" your comments. There is no such thing as ghosting. We removed one single comment of yours because it was false.\n\nStop spreading misinformation and trying to confuse newbies.\n\n    also i wouldnt care about this actually cept its important when u understand that forks from bitcoin are important for bitcoin to survive..cuz forks from bitcoin are like feelers for what bitcoin can do and like a true test in the real world\n\nFalse. Utter bullshit.\n\nForks are not \"like Bitcoin's feelers\"\n\nShitcoins that fork off from Bitcoin are not a good thing and we shouldn't encourage or support them.\n\nYou thing BCH, BSV, BTG, and BCD are a good thing?\n\n    but bcash was trying to be a better bitcoin\n\nFalse. They wanted to take over Bitcoin and it was an attack on Bitcoin. Bcash was created because a group of Bitcoin miners in China that controlled a large amount of Bitcoin's hashrate were using a secret mining enhancement called AsicBoost that gave them a 20% hashrate advantage. Bitcoin was going to implement SegWit and SegWit is not compatible with AsicBoost. The majority of miners did not support SegWit because they were using AsicBoost and they wanted to keep using AsicBoost.\n\nBitcoin Improvement Proposals are how Bitcoin is upgraded. If someone has an idea of how to improve Bitcoin, then they can submit a BIP. And there is already an altcoin that acts as Bitcoin's live in the field testnet. It's called Litecoin. New technology can be tried out on Litecoin before being considered for Bitcoin. That's what was done with the Lightning Network. And now Litecoin is going to integrate mimblewimble which could possibly be implemented on Bitcoin in the future.\"\n\nso i replyed back:\n\n\"so you just called litecoin an altcoin...so tell me why you didnt call it a shitcoin? after all it is a fork from bitcoin that made someone really rich and that now rich person used to work at coinbase hmmmm...\n\nits called the blocksize war not the asic boost war..they even have a book about it\n\nyou say things like false and utter bullshit but really its just your opinion\n\nif you think 'they' wanted to take over bitcoin do you now think the 'theys' are now gone forever and bitcoin is like forever safe or something?\n\nif bitcoin stays on a singlular path and cant fork then it 'is' taken over because price discovery is in the den of the old fiat monsters and its done through i.o.u's same way all things on the markets are controlled so thats why people use real estate for saving..but real estate is taxed on the clock so ya its ok i guess lol...but can you tax gold or bitcoin on the clock?\n\nim not sure who im talking to right now but it seems you havnt thought all of this out too well cuz your solution of bitcoin ossifying or staying on a singular path has lots of holes in it\n\ncant you see i want us all to work together and all im really talking about here is that bitcoin can do much much more than it is right now and at the same time be even more stable and under less threats from 'all' angles\n\nhow else can we solve the paper bitcoin i.o.u's problem too? well this bitcoin 'eco-system' solves all of the problems and actually you havnt even mentioned one reason why this is 'bad' for bitcoin\"\n\nthen got this reply back:\n\n\n\n   \" so you just called litecoin an altcoin...so tell me why you didnt call it a shitcoin?\n\nI don't call Litecoin a shitcoin because it's basically Bitcoin's live in the field test net. New tech can be tested on a real cryptocurrency before being considered for Bitcoin. Because if something happens critical to Litecoin, it's no big deal. But if something critical happened to Bitcoin, it would be a big deal. But I don't consider 100% of altcoins to be shitcoins. And being a shitcoin has nothing to do with if they forked off from Bitcoin or not. I can think of one particular altcoin that isn't a shitcoin and it didn't fork off from Bitcoin. But I do agree with you about premined coins. All premined coins are shitcoins. But well over 99% of all altcoins are shitcoins.\n\nThe only thing that I like about Litecoin is that new Bitcoin technology can get tested on it before being considered for Bitcoin. And the Litecoin developers have been supportive of this. But the fact is, Litecoin practically had a premine because the first 10,000 blocks were mined in a bit over 23 hours. Only 576 blocks should've been mined in the first day according to the officially communicated blocktime of 2.5 minutes. This emission is almost 18 times faster than scheduled and it didn't change despite 4 difficulty adjustments. That was basically a premine for Charlie Lee. Then Charlie Lee sold all of his LTC for over $200 each.\n\nI didn't day that Bitcoin should ossify. Bitcoin is upgraded through BIPs. If someone has an idea to upgrade Bitcoin, then they can submit a BIP. Shitcoins forking off from Bitcoin is not a good thing. Shitcoin forks don't solve the paper bitcoin IOU problem. Don't buy paper bitcoin and you wont have a problem.\n\nI'm finished having this conversation with you. You don't understand Bitcoin and forks as well as you think you do. Stop spreading misinformation or maybe we will start \"ghosting your misinformation comments\" AKA removing them. You already accused us of it.\"\n\nYou have been temporarily muted from r/Bitcoin. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/Bitcoin for 7 days.\n\nend of story: just thought id let you guys know cuz many of you probably already been through it too and idk where else can a person go for justice when the mods are being gatekeepers on bitcoin and preventing ideas also they deleted many more than just 1 of my comments its just its hard to dig them up\n\nidk maybe some here can see the bigger picture of how to get everyone working together instead of against each other..but idk maybe bitcoin has already ossified and the only way now is for some smaller coin to do the bitcoin eco-system thing through the forking power and put the pressure onto the ossified bitcoin..thats sort of how it would work in the eco-system anyways",

I'm an SE student, close to finishing my degree, and decided to build this from the ground up as a way to help the BCH and smartBCH community while serving as a learning experience.\n\nThis is my first 'real' project, so it probably has a few bugs, sorry mobile users \ud83d\ude2c. Please report anything you see wrong, any issues you see, any requests, or any projects you think should be added to the Support/Listing Telegram at [https://t.me/borrachocash](https://t.me/borrachocash).\n\nYou can also join the Announcements channel at [https://t.me/borrachocashannouncements](https://t.me/borrachocashannouncements), where I'll post any important updates.\n\nAnyways, this is very much a work in progress and a 'roadmap' for the site and my future plans will be released soon...or at some point. \n\n[Screenshot of Borracho.cash\\/smartBCH](https://preview.redd.it/k11hphp149y81.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ca296143f6f51005f5b4fa8ddc8fe9a337bba6a)",
