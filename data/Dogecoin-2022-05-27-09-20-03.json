Each trailing digit puts you in a different line. \n\nThe more specific you are, the more likely to be in a shorter line, getting your request processed by the system when the price meets your specificity.\n\nThat's why 69420, being so popular (not to mention immature \ud83d\ude44) will have a SUPER long request queue, and depending on when you put in your limit order, and how fast the system processes requests, you might miss out, until the price hits it again, and more limits are processed.\n\nThat said, 69418, 19, 22, 23, etc, will arguably have a shorter queue, thus, getting your request processed sooner.",
