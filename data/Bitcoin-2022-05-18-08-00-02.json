I\u2018m not really asking in terms of what would be better for the human race but more in terms of likelihood. \nWhy wouldn\u2019t governments and central banks if pressured enough just go back to a gold standard? Because if they did, i fear for the future of Bitcoin. \n\nI for one am all on the idea of a bitcoin backed economy. This could be the end of so much war and suffering in the world. Such a grand idea\u2026\n\nAnyways, give me your best takes!",
