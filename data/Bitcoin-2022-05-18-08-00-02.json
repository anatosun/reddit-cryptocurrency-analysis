I\u2018m not really asking in terms of what would be better for the human race but more in terms of likelihood. \nWhy wouldn\u2019t governments and central banks if pressured enough just go back to a gold standard? Because if they did, i fear for the future of Bitcoin. \n\nI for one am all on the idea of a bitcoin backed economy. This could be the end of so much war and suffering in the world. Such a grand idea\u2026\n\nAnyways, give me your best takes!",

Gold is also tangible. People and countries that buy shit loads of the stuff will also buy crypto, if they think it\u2019s a good investment, but only time will tell how gold is affected by digital assets",

Yes it is expensive to transport, but its also quite immortal and doesn't require a network host of people for security.\n\nAt the end of the day, currency is just a place holder, or token, for goods and services. Gold has always filled that need. Fiat on the other hand fails miserably. \n\nIt doesn't matter what currency we use to back the economy, as long as its not fiat.",
