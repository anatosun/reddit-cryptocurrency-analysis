I'd bet its not a reactor they get in the habit of shutting down regularly, it probably takes days to start back up.  When the laser isn't in operation, that reactor must be kept under load somehow, so I'd reason they could plausibly launch a 51% attack on bitcoin.",

Am I allowed to do this. Obviously I would pay CGT tax on it. Now let\u2019s say I sell it to a friend (not shared finances). Am I allowed to do that?\nLastly, the critical scenario. Let\u2019s say bought 1 BTC at the ATH at 80k AUD and sell it to my wife now for 45k AUD. Can I claim a tax loss?\nThanks for any infos on why this is not a thing are welcomed. I assume there is some law prohibiting this.",
