The Account owner name you used for collecting payment must be consistent with your registered name on Binance. (The name shall be identical with the KYC Verified name on Binance.)\"\n\nI am not sure if this means that the name on the receiving bank account has to be matching with the binance account.\n\nMe and my family share one bank account and I would like to specify that bank account for my P2P-transactions. I do have to specify an intermediary bank for transactions.\n\nThe receiving bank assigns it to the correct recipient based on the details provided in the \"purpose of payment / reference\" field of the transaction - this is the only field where the name of the account holder is entered.\n\nHere a summary: Buyer -> Intermediary Bank -> Receiving Bank (uses the reference line to assign it to the correct recipient)  \n\n\nIs this an issue for me when trading with P2P?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest regards",
