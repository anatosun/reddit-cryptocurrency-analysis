Even the squares got some degen in them and could probably be convinced if it is pumping while everything else crashes and burns. Best selling point: you don't have to worry about company policies, greed, supply chain issues, etc. \n   Let's help make this the play instead of telling all potential buyers how doomed it is every single place they look. Everybody wants to \"be right\" about price action for internet strangers. The real strategy would be to talk it up. Get it out there as the savior of your port. Get it movin. Volume will follow.",
