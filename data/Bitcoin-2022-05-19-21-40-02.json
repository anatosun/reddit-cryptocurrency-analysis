            "selftext": "What is a mile? Before the metric system it was considered as 8 furlongs. So what is a furlong? It was an English unit of length based on the distance a team of Oxen could pull a plough before having to rest. So it was able to be manipulated for gain. Wanted a bigger field? Get a stronger team of oxen. So ultimately those with assets were able to get stronger oxen, bigger fields, more yield and became wealthier. Sound familiar?\nThe mile became more stable when measured against km, 1.609km in mile. So what is a kilometer? It\u2019s based on the distance between the orbital poles and the equator. So 10,000 km between the poles and the equator. It\u2019s infinitely divisible. It\u2019s finite, unless the world unilaterally decides to change where the equator or the poles are located\u2026\nBitcoin is metric. It\u2019s not replacing $\u2019s, Euro\u2019s or Pounds. Bitcoin is a tool to measure value and ultimately stabilizes other forms of measuring value. It\u2019s not going to be easy, because those most threatened by it are those who\u2019s ability to get bigger fields is at risk. \nThis is why the posts in here saying Bitcoin is not political are important. Bitcoin should not political just like a mile is no longer political. The countries and political parties who recognize this first will ultimately win. Miles, kilometers, furlongs, acres, inches all co-exist, just like Bitcoin and other currencies will one day co-exist. The only thing remotely political about Bitcoin is that we need to help politicians learn that they can\u2019t stop it. Resistance will be like resisting the metric system, pointless and ultimately self defeating. \u00a0",

But the real value of course comes from its utility. This is where the analogy actually breaks down, because for oil to become worthless, we would have to assume that anything oil-based falls into disuse as well. So cars and traffic infrastructure wouldn't be a given anymore, and your car would be useless essentially by definition of the worthlessness of oil.\n\nI think the comparison here is quite shaky and doesn't hold up well. In order for anything to lose its value like that, it has to lose its utility. That's one of the reasons I'm personally so confident in Bitcoin to begin with.\n\nEdit: Another scenario where the price of gold and oil plummets is of course extreme supply inflation. Oxygen is free, but still extremely valuable. But this scenario of course can't apply to Bitcoin due to the strictly limited supply.",

Individuals invest into Bitcoin without really understanding the \"why\" and then sell out with massive losses. That, or they see stories of others who make this terrible blind action mistake.\n\nOnce the notion of Bitcoin being a ponzi enters your mind it starts to feel \"evil\" and this is what drives Buttcoiners intense hatred and mockery\u2013not bitterness or insecurity.\n\nBitcoin is one of the few things open to retail investment from the very beginning. It has had real problems which needed (and still need) to be solved. Most people simply cannot imagine a future state of Bitcoin. It's all about what it *IS* right now (more precisely, what is *WAS* when they first made this instant judgement).\n\nYou can't really expect the average person to understand the development of early technology, especially when the price fluctuates based on emotional sentiment changes around the development of that technology.",

Early on I used buttcoin to identify the questions I hadn't asked, and then went out to see if those apparent weaknesses in BTC could materialize into a failure of some type. Eventually I wasn't seeing any new things that I felt I needed to look into so I basically stopped going.\n\nI still go back periodically to see if there is any valuable discourse but it's become an echo chamber and I'd be really surprised to find much value there these days.\n\nIf you want to get all of the value of (early) buttcoin with all the snark, angst and an actual discussion, check out Bitcoin Uncensored. Its not for everyone, and its pretty likely to offend more than a few people, but being able to speak at a technical level and address socially relevant themes makes it a far more valuable resource than buttcoin.",

It boggles my mind how these people knew about BTC for many years, seen it all play out and still refuse to accept it. A few of them admitted to owning btc at one time and selling for a good fiat profit but will not acknowledge BTC as a possible alternative to the fiat monetary system. I wonder whether there is a dollar equivalent BTC could reach to make a person there admit they were wrong or at least trigger some self-reflection on their part. For me, I heard about BTC when it was $1.00 assumed it was a scam. I started investigating it for the first time  it hit $600 to understand why anyone would pay that sum of money to purchase it.",

The community is founded on 'anti' reasoning, but rarely makes suggestions on alternatives. I guess they assume no alternative is required? To be fundamentally negative without providing a better suggestion to the problem faced in the fiat system just seems fuckin flat to me. Like if all you can do is sit around being negative, I don't know how far you're gonna get in life.\n2. Lately, most of their vitriol and disdain for Bitcoin has diverged broadly into crypto, especially ponzis like luna. I feel like sometimes they willing conflate the two, which is odd for a group of people who purport to know enough about the subject to have a firm negative conviction about it. Seems a bit strawman to me. Regardless, I'm not a big fan of their 'told you so' schadenfreude approach to people who've lost a lot of their stored value, no matter how stupid or irresponsible they were.",
