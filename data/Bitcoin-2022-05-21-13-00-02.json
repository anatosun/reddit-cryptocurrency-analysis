Entirely without KYC. Otherwise if you can do SEPA transactions you can use Pocket or Relai (no KYC, just need to authenticate the address your paying out to and the Bitcoins are sent out as soon as the SEPA transaction goes through). Otherwise I can recommend Kraken if you want a traditional exchange",
