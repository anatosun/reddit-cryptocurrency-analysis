I panicked for nothing (my bad). Hopefully, the Polygon team will release the Eth on the Ethereum side for me.\n\nEdit2: for anyone in my situation. Pressing confirm on the bridge explorer didn't work for me. I had to manually go to here, https://withdraw.polygon.technology/\nEnter the transaction hash and trigger the withdrawal. Hope that helps.\n\nEdit3: after triggering the withdrawal, the tx completed and the 209 ETH arrived on the Ethereum side.",

It takes more than 1 transaction and the burning is one of them.",

If you\u2019ve used this bridge a lot then you ought to be familiar with the process, and I\u2019m pretty sure that process invokes the null address to burn your polygon assets before releasing them to mainnet.

The team doesn't have to do anything, it's in your hands.\n\n(For completeness) A quick note about the bridge, when you bridge from Ethereum -> Polygon, new tokens are minted on the Polygon chain while your original tokens are locked on Ethereum. When you bridge back from Polygon -> Ethereum, those tokens are burnt and your tokens are released on Ethereum. That is what you're seeing in your transaction. To note: this is how the bridge has always worked; the Polygon team has not modified any contracts.",

From my understanding the Polygon transaction burns the WETH and issues a receipt that gets sync'd to mainnet that lets you withdraw the actual ETH to mainnet with that `exit()` call. Maybe there's been an issue with the UI that didn't let you initiate that second transaction from mainnet. But I'm pretty sure as a last resort the Polygon team can work out the data you need to make that call and get your ETH back on mainnet",
