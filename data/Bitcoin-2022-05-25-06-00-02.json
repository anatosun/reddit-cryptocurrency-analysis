Why has the block time increased and can we assume that is temporary?",

The block time always converges towards 10 minutes because there is a mining target adjustment every 2016 blocks. The adjustment is exactly proportional to the time ratio  \n\n    New Target = Old Target * (Actual Time of Last 2016 Blocks / 20160 minutes)\n\nIn between each adjustment, the block interval could stay above 10 minutes if there are more and more miners retiring. That is, you can assume it is temporary, but there is a scenario where longer block intervals persist  \n\nThe most recent adjustment happened a few hours ago. For several days, it was predicted the difficulty would adjust by -4%, and then the actual adjustment was +0.35%",
