            "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nBeen doing a bit of a spring clean on some old backups, found 2 of my old wallet.dats. Loaded up bitcoin-core and downloaded like 400gb of blockchain. Loaded the wallet and what do you know, 0.64BTC left in the wallet from my mining days in 2013. Score!\n\nAnyway, loaded my OG wallet, 0.03 BTC, not as nice a score, but a score none the less. \n\nSo I thought, lets consolidate these together. Tried to send the 0.64 to my OG wallet. \n\nNow, its been a while since I have done a transfer, in the OG wallet, I created a new receive address. On the loaded wallet, I went to \"send\", put in my new receive address, told it to use all available funds from the wallet and to subtract the miner fees (60 mins).\n\nMoment of truth, I hit the send button, Nothing, Error stating \"insufficient funds\" \"transaction cannot be created. \"\n\nI had a quick read about it being the miner fees, So i tried to increase them as well as decrease them but nothing seemed to work to allow me to transfer the coins.\n\nAny one have any advice or information on how to get these funds transferred to another wallet?\n\nCheers in advanced,\n\nP.S. Please don't PM me, I wont be sending anything to anywhere or anyone, I wont be putting anything into a website. I don't need to re-silver, re-sync, re-bit, re-whatever my wallet..........",

Basically, what you'll do is transfer your BTC out and then you'll want to get clients for each of the forks, claim your coins by creating a wallet with your private keys, then store them or send them to an exchange to trade for some real coins. You can read up more details on how to do that but I wanted to make sure you realized that it existed. When I went through this, I just d/led all of the Electrum clients. Worked perfectly.",
