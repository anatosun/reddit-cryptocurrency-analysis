Knowledge here refers to the knowledge of specific words in a specific order.\n\nOne other scenario where this happens is online accounts, where the account is deemed your property and if someone knows the password, the account is considered stolen. But there its an account with another company like facebook, amazon, etc. So its more like a security.\n\nWith bitcoin, its not a security, so no third party can verify your ownership.\n\nIm not taking sides with scammers or anything as much as it sounds like what im doing. Its just the nature of how bitcoin works. We only have the ability to move funds out of a wallet, but we dont actually own anything.",

By who, and what gives them the authority to have the final say on what is considered stolen (this is a rhetorical question)?\n\nOwnership is usually something that is enforced - and while we normal rely on localised laws to enforce this, with BTC it is up to ourselves to enforce this ownership by keeping our seed phrase secure. The fact it is knowledge-based and not physical is what makes such decentralised standards of ownership feasible.",

Applications from Bitwise, WisdomTree, Fidelity, and Ark 21 Shares, among others, have all been rejected or have had their applications extended.\n\nThe SEC authorized all prior bitcoin futures ETFs under the \"40 Act\" (the Investment Company Act of 1940), but Teucrium filed its successful application under the \"33 Act\" (or the Securities Act of 1933) and the \"34 Act\" (or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). \n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler indicated last year that he felt more comfortable using 40 Act funds because of the investor protections entrenched in the law, as well as the market surveillance capabilities regulating the futures market, as CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De pointed out last week. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a traditional exchange with well-established surveillance tools, handles the majority of the trading volume.\n\nGiven that the spot bitcoin ETF applications have all been filed under the 33 and 34 Act, however, some see the Teucrium decision opening the way for a spot ETF to win approval.",

Let me tell you,  there is a HUGE difference between wanting to do something and actually doing it!  Huge thanks to everyone in r/Bitcoin that have made fun of all the panic sells and dips and FUD and given me confidence in the asset and ultimately myself.

Cryptocurrency seeks to make the case for legitimacy but exists as a solution without a problem. Bitcoin simply works well right now within our society because no other mechanisms for preserving wealth have succeeded to remain impartial from human greed that works to steal from many for the enrichment of the few.  \n\nWith that said, history had intended that altcoins would be the safe space beyond Bitcoin Testnet where exotic experiments, ideas, and implementations could take place. That we'd ultimately activate some of the more exotic bips on those other altcoins and perhaps if merited, would take some of those ideas and apply them back to Bitcoin.\n\nI think we've seen that actually happen too with litecoin adopting and activating segwit first.  I'd offer that we do the same thing with bip119 as well.",

Two of them (open source and permissionless) enable upgradability, being cautious around it makes sense, denying it can and should happen (with consensus) is going against those principles.\n\nFor BIP119 I think the consensus is pretty limited for now and from what I understand it does seem to alter one of the fundamental principle of Bitcoin (fungibility), so it's unlikely to get my support.",

And we probably need to solve scalability pretty soon.\n\nTo put the problem into perspective:\n\nThere are 31,622,400 seconds in a year. The Bitcoin network throughput is estimated at 4-7 transactions per second. Being generous by taking the upper figure, the theoretical maximum number of level 1 transactions that can occur per year is 221,356,800.\n\nThe world population is 7.9 billion. So we have enough Bitcoin layer 1 transactions for only about *2.8%* of the world to do one single transaction per year. The population of the United States is about 335,000,000. So if only Americans transact, the throughput only allows about *66%* of Americans to do one transaction per year.\n\nGetting onboarded onto lightning requires at least one but more realistically several channels to be created for each person's wallet. Today, each channel open is a transaction.\n\nAssuming everyone opens only a single Lightning channel, it would take over a year to onboard all Americans. It would take over 35 years to onboard the world. Again, that's only one channel per person which isn't enough for Lightning to work well.\n\nAnd Lightning isn't going to be the only layer 2 competing for scarce layer 1 resources. It really won't take long for this scalability problem to stunt the adoption of Lightning and Bitcoin generally. Maybe it already is.\n\nI'm not saying we need to run around with our hair on fire and reck layer 1 in our haste to fix scalability, but if we don't solve it relatively soon then what we'll end up with is a lot pseudo-layer 2's and competing side chains that aren't really tied to the layer 1 and are unable to provide no-trust payments. I.e. We'll end up with centralized systems without any of the benefits of Bitcoin.",

Effectively Miners and Developers would be given a greater possibility to collude with each other while node operators are left out. \nWhy? Because its a speedy trial (like taproot was) as opposed to USAF (user activated soft fork) \nAnd the implementation of a MASF (Miner activated soft fork)\n\nProponents of BIP-119 will argue that MASF mimimizes risk of consensus failure in cooperative scenario while UASF incentivizes cooperation in adversarial scenario.\n\nHowever, this method of consensus is flawed. Introducing new changes to a soft fork via Miner Signaling shift consensus towards the miners and devs and away from pleb Node operators. You wont be able to \u201cvote with your node\u201d so to speak because it\u2019s a speedy trial. The Devs asked the Miners and the Miners agreed. From that point they see no need for UASF. \n\nBitcoin should not adopt a culture of rapidly accepting more features nobody was asking for. This is the the wish of just a few people. Not all. One Developer made the initial proposal. \n\nThe big red flag is how fast and aggressively this is trying to be pushed out while changing the consensus methods. After Taproot and it\u2019s speedy trial, some people did realise that this consensus method might not be good for the future of the network. \n\nThere is NO urgency or problem that needs to be solved by this or in this manner. \nIf you can point one out please do so. \n\nUpdates to the code should be for efficiency and security of the network. Not adding complexity. \n\nSpeedy Trial is an attack Vector\n\nAny soft fork activated via Bitcoin Core is an attack vector\n\nTomer Strolight writes:\n\u201cThis is a crucial point to understand. Anyone giving miners an activation path in Bitcoin Core that excludes users is taking control of Bitcoin. Doesn't matter if they're doing it for safety or ease. It's better to risk a bumpy activation than exclude users in consensus changes.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s my 2c. Flame away.",

I'd argue that taproot was actually far more controversial as a protocol change and that sailed through.\n\nThis issue for me is that it's new and unproven. Other non-compatible procotol changes may turn out to be better (or not) and that needs time for knowledgeable people to flesh out and play with. The pacing of this obviously frustrated Jeremy, and he has shot himself in the foot by doing this. This is unfortunate because BIP-119 contains lots of good ideas that would enable a more powerful lightning network.\n\nIn principle I am not opposed to this change, but I do not approve of the way it is being accelerated artificially. So my node will not be signalling for it.\n\nProponents of speedy trial should take note of what they have unleashed.",

Its adoption is based on these facts and the fact that it is secure.\n\nEthereum and others are in the smart contract race and it is completely fine for them to be doing that where they are.

Whatever they choose to do though they need to do it well. Bitcoin does what it does so we'll entire countries are making it legal tender. This process alone has legs for growth for decades ... My thoughts anyways.",

That doesn't work and is not scalable in a decentralised way.\n\nBitcoin has to be money. Solid, hard, imnutable money.\n\nThis is the killer app.\n\nThen at 2nd layers do what you please.

I just want to see what the community has to say.\r  \n\r  \nI am 24 years old and the owner of 2 whole coins. They are held in cold storage under a passphrase and keys that are backed up in multiple locations, they are my most prized positions. Since 2016 I have bit the orange pill hard, and every extra cent I could muster has gone to acquiring bitcoin. The sum right now is a good chunk of change for someone my age but it is not all that life changing.\r  \n\r  \nMy reason for writing this post is that I am graduating college with my business degree and have been interviewing for new jobs, but honestly the thought of having to keep grinding after the last couple of years is so daunting. I am tired and burnt out from work and school and the type of jobs in my range of experience are all soul sucking office jobs, I just applied for a job that offered 60k salary but the hours would be insane, like 12 hour days in a HCOL city.\r  \n\r  \nWhile in these interviews I can't help but look out the window and think about my two little coins. What do you think will happen in the next six years? There are two more halvings this decade, is it premature to think that these coins can get me out of wage slavery? I find myself daydreaming that maybe I will have the ability to live comfortably. I am not talking about lambos and first class travel, but a quiet and comfortable life.\r  \n\r  \nI understand that nobody really knows, I am just hoping someone will tell me things will be okay i guess lol.",

            "selftext": "That's right.\n\nYour wallet creates these addresses at random. These addresses do not exist anywhere in the blockchain or network until they are used for the first time.\n\nYou can even create these addresses on your own using dice, pen and paper.\n\nNobody assigns them to you. You create them.\n\nIn practice, it goes more or less like this:\n\n**1)** Your wallet randomly chooses 24 words. These words act like a \"seed\" which generates a bunch of private keys.\n\n**2)** These private keys are then used to generate public keys and addresses.\n\n**3)** You can then share those addresses with anyone so they can send you money.\n\n**4)** When someone sends money to one of your addresses, this transaction is registered into the blockchain (public ledger).\n\n**5)** That money is now yours.\n\nYou might have several questions now:\n\n**QUESTION**: If my addresses and keys are generated at random, what happens if another wallet generates my same keys and addresses? Wouldn't that person have access to my money?\n\n**ANSWER**: Yes. They would be able to spend your money. However, the probability of this is so low, that it would take someone millions of years to generate your same keys using brute force.\n\nThe important thing here is that your keys are generated randomly. Your wallet needs to use enough entropy. A password \"Iloveyoumom\" is not as random as \"dyb#$v72Df&z9wUmA\".\n\nMost wallets use algorithms that generate seeds pretty randomly. If you don't trust software for this, you can generate your own seed using dice.\n\n**QUESTION**: How does the network knows that I'm the only one with permission to spend the money in those addresses? What happens if someone else tries to spend money from one of my addresses?\n\n**ANSWER**: In order to spend money in Bitcoin, you need to sign the transaction using your private key. This digital signature proves that you have permission to spend the money in that address.\n\nThe network verifies this digital signature using your *public* key, but your *private* key remains private, it never leaves your phone or computer.\n\n**QUESTION**: So let me get this straight. The wallet's main job is to generate keys and sign transactions?\n\n**ANSWER**: That is correct. A wallet does not store money. It stores keys. Those keys are used to generate addresses and sign transactions.\n\n**QUESTION**: So what is the difference between a warm wallet and a cold wallet?\n\n**ANSWER**: A warm wallet stores your private keys on your phone or computer. This means that your keys are exposed to the internet and could potentially be stolen by a hacker.\n\nA cold wallet stores your keys in an offline device. When you send a transaction, **your cold wallet signs the transaction inside the device and then transfer this signed transaction to your computer or phone**. This is done this way so that your private keys never leave your cold wallet device and therefore are never exposed to the internet.\n\n**QUESTION**: Wow, so why would I want to use a warm wallet?\n\n**ANSWER**: You use a warm wallet for everyday transactions and ease of use. The probability of being hacked is very low if you use an open source app such as Muun Wallet.\n\nUse warm wallets for low amounts (less than $1k or so). Use cold wallets for life changing money or lifelong savings.\n\n**QUESTION**: What happens if I lose my wallet?\n\n**ANSWER**: You use your seed to restore it.\n\nBy the way, a cold wallet will never ask you to type your seed on a computer or phone. You type it directly on your cold wallet device. Remember, the seed of a cold wallet is never exposed to the internet.\n\n**QUESTION**: What is the best way to store and protect my wallet seed?\n\n**ANSWER**: Offline. Do not store your seed on your computer or phone. Never take a screenshot or a photo it either.\n\nKeep it offline. Use pen and paper, tamper-evident bags, seedplates, etc. Keep 2 or 3 copies in different places. Hide them extremely well. Never tell anyone how much bitcoin you have.\n\n**QUESTION**: I have my money on an exchange (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc). What should I do?\n\n**ANSWER**: You don't have any money. They own the private keys and therefore they own the money. Take your bitcoin off exchanges and move it into your own wallet before it's too late. Don't say we didn't warn you.",
