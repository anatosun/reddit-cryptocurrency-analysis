I\u2019m quite new to Binance, I\u2019ve had my account for about a month (got verified inmediately, luckily, I\u2019ve seen many had problems with it) \n\nI use the mobile version.\nAnd I know this is very rookie/amateur question (never traded with crypto before)\n\nBut I don\u2019t understand how can I get a payment on crypto through Binance (if that\u2019s even possible at all)\n\nDo I just provide to my client with my email or something like that? \n\nAny orientation would be much appreciated \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",
