            "selftext": "Hi, I have made a few thought experiments about the scalability problem of bitcoin and wanted to present them to a wider community.\n\n# Scalability issue\n\nThe main problem with the scalability issue is that every node competes against each other, instead of working together. This inevitably let to centralization in mining power.\n\n# Solution\n\nScalability without compromises in security and decentralization can only be achieved when solving the inherent problem of the mining race. When two disjunct blocks are mined. Disjunct meaning that all transactions are unique. Then the work has been efficiently split in two. But only one of the blocks will survive the pruning in the long run. But if we were to allow merging of such blocks the network will scale as compute power has essentially been shared.\n\nThis leads to a duplication of mining fees and removes the capacity limit of 21 million bitcoin. To re-enable this the mining fee can be split in fractions of 2 and the chains that are going to be merged have to have at maximum a minted value corresponding to the original reward function at this time.\n\nFurther the time two branches are allowed to be separated has to be limited, to discourage forks and a large amount of retakes of transactions. ~~My suggestions is 144 blocks which corresponds to 1 day.~~ To detect the double spend transactions in a timely manner this is set to 2, which takes 20 minutes in a highly connected network. All chains that have a last common predecessor before this time, except the chain which has accumulated the most blocks will be discarded.\n\nA relative easy rule has to be that chains to merge have to have the same block height to keep the race to 10 minutes.\n\nA valid question for all of this appears here. Why would anyone reduce his mining reward. The answer goes back to economics. If one were to enhance ones own mining power he would be faster, but only for a short amount of time. But if he were to add a new branch then he could increase his value generation with throughput from mining fees without time limit.\n\n# Further problems\n\nWith infinite transaction throughput there is the problem with space to store the block chain (now a DAG), as it will grow with the amount of transactions and the current rule of 70 to 80 GB per year is not valid any more.\n\nIf I have overlooked something or this solution does not work, I am open for feedback and suggestions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: changed branch separation from 144 to 2",

In my opinion this will lead to exactly the same problem we have now, just with compressed transactions.\n\nRemoving the block size limit could lead to spam and rapid growth of block chain size. But can be counteracted by miners that only allow transaction with a minimum fee. This would make the problem more elegant and simpler, but has been rejected by the community.\n\nAdditionally it would still lead to mining pools, as the arms race to be the first is still there.\n\nYes, the only way the overhead in merging the chains can be fixed is, if everyone does it frequently.\n\nThe resolving process, where m and n are the amount of possible dijunct transactions in each branch, will blow up to m\\*n which can be acceptable as long as m and n are small. O(m\\*n) could be decreased when sorting all transaction hashes in O((m+n)\\*log(m+n)) and then checking each neighbor hash.\n\nAnother thing is, if the miners do not cooperate and only try to solve the problem on their own it will come down to whoever has the branch with the most blocks after 24 hours. If there is a majority that plays nicely however, they would win in this scenario.\n\nEdit: Fixed formatting",

I think you may be confusing the Lightning Network as a whole with a single payment channel on the Lightning network. \n\nThe lightning network can theoretically scale to 1,000,000 transactions per second. Visa by comparison can scale to around 24,000 TPS and currently handles only around 1,700 TPS. There is plenty of capacity in the Lightning network. \n\n\u201cIf there is a majority that play nice\u2026they would win\u201d - do you see the problem here? In a system with massive financial incentives you are proposing a solution that relies on a majority \u201cplaying nice\u201d. Game theory suggests this would attract a fair share of \u201cbad actors\u201d. The beauty of Bitcoin\u2019s design (and the Lightning Network that works on top of it) is that there is no incentive for bad actors - in fact they are penalized. We don\u2019t need to trust anyone to \u201cplay nice\u201d. \n\nI suggest spending some time studying the Lightning Network.
