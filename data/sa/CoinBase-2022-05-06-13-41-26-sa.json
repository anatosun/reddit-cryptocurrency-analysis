I went ahead and did that since it wasn't much. I now get stuck with \"payment pending\" we are still waiting for funds from a recent\npayment. Your account will be restored as soon as we receive funds.\n\nFunny thing is when I go to the transfers it has the transfer marked as completed. How long does it take? I've been reading from anywhere from 1 day to pretty much never",
