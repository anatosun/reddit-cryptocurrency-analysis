By being mergemined with  up to 25% of BTC hash rate it maintains one of the most secure networks on the planet whilst using no extra power at all which means it is also the greenest. In Syscoin 4.3 they have also added chainlocks on the masternode layer to ensure extra security against 51% and MEV meaning it could be classed as the most secure. \n\nWhen Ethereum finally pivots to PoS then the devs believe it will again retain the favourism of the majority of developers and other L1s will have to become rollups themselves on other networks to survive. Syscoin will provide an alternative to this by being PoW. \n\nThere will be talks on how zkrollups will effect the buidl mode of next couple of years as we are approaching fully evm compatible rollups. \n\nAlso there will be an announcement of a new partnership at the end!\n\nJag has been responsible for helping on projects ranging from Dogecoin to Coinbase to Dash and Matic. Also delivered the first BTC to ETH bridge, ZDAG and regulation compliant tech.",

From art, to sports, to gaming, to dApps with real world use cases, blockchain technology is honestly unstoppable.\n\nI wish I learned coding so I could get in on this technology as well. In fact there are already some crypto projects like Studyum working on creating a crypto compatible educational platform for students and teachers so hopefully more platforms like this one start popping up.\n\nI\u2019m sure blockchain\u2019s take over is inevitable. It\u2019s already in wide use even though it\u2019s still a very young technology.",
