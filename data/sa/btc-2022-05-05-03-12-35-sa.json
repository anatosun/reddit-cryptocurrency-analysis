            "selftext": "Slovenian lawmakers to vote on the de-facto crypto ban\n\nIn Slovenia a crypto taxation law is proposed that would tax all exchanges from crypto to fiat with 5% tax on whole exchanged amount. Crypto payments are included which effectively adds 5% to all prices for goods and services when paying with crypto. GoCrypto, a company partially funded by u/MemoryDealers is one of the main proponents of this law and is publicly supporting it as well as lobbying for it. Slovenia was once considered a crypto powerhouse and is where Bitstamp was born. It seems now the small EU country is degrading crypto to a purely speculative asset and stripping it of its basic utility.",
