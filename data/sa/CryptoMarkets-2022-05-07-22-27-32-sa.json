It\u2019s an interesting to watch humanity struggle against its self made shackles, the will of the people for its own greater good VS the attempt of the few to dominate the many. Reminds me of slime mold formations where every system attempts to build community structures but genetic mutations allow some individuals to not contribute to the system and instead just reap the benefits. This continues until there are more cheaters then contributers and the whole community dies due to loss competition to other communities with less cheaters. It\u2019s a micro cosume for all this mess me make together, in our nations, our communities and our homes",

            "selftext": "**NOTE: While i am aware that the challenge itself is stocks and not crypto, everything outlined in here, works for crypto these are genral trading trading rules.**\n\nHey all,\n\nWelcome to the 9th day of the $1k to $10k Challenge, where I daytrade my way to $10k.\n\nA few notes before the update:\n\n1. I'm using a cash account to avoid PDT\n2. I mostly day trade 0DTE QQQ options, but not opposed to any opportunity that comes up\n3. I use Support/Resistances, VWAP, 50/200 MA, and RSI to daytrade.\n4. I use the 1-minute chart\n\n**Challenge Overview**\n\n2 weeks in and we are up 130%, this is beyond amazing! No longer do i  have to do 1 contract per trade. I swear you dont know how much this  means, till you lose it.So normally i give a daily breakdown, but i  thought i would collect all the questions i have been asked on Reddit  and Discord and create a sort of FAQ that everyone could refer to, if  need be. Please note non of this is financial advice and im by no means  the best trader but i do well enough to live off trading. But before we  start here is the obligatory account update.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b3ow1sczx2y81.jpg?width=368&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3922bcec3c093d4235e6ec51d16ec6ed94aaea0b\n\n**What is the Setup I Use?**\n\nLet's  go over my trading setup since I have been asked about that . Now I  like to keep things super simple, I'm not a fan of a million screens and  indicators.\n\n* I use TradingView for charting, on that, I have RSI, VWAP, 50/200 MA, and Volume Profile loaded up.\n* I  use IKBR as my broker and use the mobile app so I can look at my screen  for the chart and my phone to order, I just got used to this setup but  you can TradeStation or a different broker, whatever you are really  comfortable with, it doesn't make much of a difference.\n* While  they haven't come into play yet but I also use Unusual Whales for  Options Flow and IKBR or TD Ameritrade for Order Flow and L2\n\nAgain  this is my personal preference, you should use whatever makes you the  most comfortable and can help get the most information and place trades  quickly. But since I have been asked here it is.\n\n**How to find Good Entries/Exits, how do I make sure my green trades don't turn red?**\n\nI'm  sure this scenario happened to you, it happened to me a lot and I get  asked this a lot in the discord. Your stop loss hits and then it runs.  Feels like the MMs have something personal against you right.This  happens because your entries are bad If you enter close to the bottom  (or top for puts) you are less likely to hit your stop loss. Easier said  than done right? WRONG. All you need is to know some trading basics  here are some:\n\nA  support/resistance will ALMOST ALWAYS be retested. So let's say support  is at $307 on QQQ, and it breaks it. Don't go long yet, wait a bit it  will go past resistance. And then go back to test $307 again, it could  happen once or twice. Then it will either make a move up or down from  here. NOW YOU HAVE A CLEAR DIRECTION, if it breaks through $307 again,  this is where you go long and place your stop loss 10% or 20% or  whatever your number is below resistance. \n\nNow, do you know why your stop  losses hit? I'll make it simpler, it breaks $307. It's at $308 now, you  pick up calls with 20% stop loss, it goes down to retest $307 and goes  down some probably $306.5 your call are down 20%, your stop loss hits,  the pullback is done, the stock breaks through $307 and runs to $310.  You are posting loss porn on reddit and crying about it. Do this and  this will almost never happen to you again.\n\nVWAP  and 50/200 MA are your friends. They act as support and resistance. So  if the stock just broke through resistance and is running the next stop  before the next resistance is probably one of these. This is a good time  to either trim or exit your position. \n\nWhat I do is get 50% out and move my stop loss to entry or a little above it. Now I apply what I wrote  above and wait for the retest if it runs again after the retest you can  move your stops to VWAP/50/200 MA. If it fails get out or let it hit the  stop your call, either way now your profitable trades won't turn into  losers.\n\n**How to Place Stop losses, how to avoid 1 bad trade taking down 10 good ones?**\n\nI'm  more often right than wrong, during this challenge i only had 1 red day  and on that day only 1 red trade that took down the day out of 3  trades. I had 3 red trades in total during this journey. The combined  losses of these 3 trades are around $550. I could have been up another  505% not including the compounding effect from these, if i managed my  losses better. My stop losses sucked. I mean sucked hard. I now got a  lot better at this. Here is how I remedied this and how you can too.\n\nI  see a lot of people pick a stop loss % out of thin air, 20% for example  as I did. While this is all good and well. I found that having my stop  losses at events made things a lot easier. For example, if the stock  broke support, retested, and then fell again. This is a good time to cut  a loser. Or if the trend changes etc \u2026. If your plan fails, what's  holding on to the stock any longer going to do, at this point, you are  hoping it will bounce back, this is pure luck and/or gambling.\n\n**How do I Position Size?**\n\nThis  is something I struggled with at the beginning of the challenge. I'm  used to trading with the main account, making $20 per trade was not  something I was used to, so I slammed full port into 0DTE or next-day  contracts. Very bad Idea. Don't ever do that. You can be right 9 times.  All it takes is one time. You cant average down and losses are huge. 25%  is my preferred size, which is still a bit high (5-10% is best). As the  account grows I'm able to do more, I have multiple contracts so I can  take starter positions and trim. So the solution here is simple, be  patient, do the boring thing so you can do the fun thing later.\n\n\\*\\*What  is the strategy I use?\\*\\*The name of the game here is confirmations, all  trading really is at its core is finding as many supporting signs that  give you a direction on where the stock is going. All we can do is find  as many signs as possible to support either a bullish or bearish thesis.  That's it, that's really all trading is, all strategies are built  around that, once you understand that you can make your own strategies  and pick your stocks.\n\nSo the  strategy I have been using so far is just that. Now as a rule of thumb  you don't want to be trading against the trend, if the market is going  up you want to be trading calls and puts if it's trending down.\n\nWhat I do is basically a combination of everything i wrote in the post so far. So for example if\n\n* The stock is at support, pulled back, and broke through support again\n* The stock price is below VWAP, 50MA, and 200MA\n* There is bearish flow coming in\n* RSI is oversold (doubt that happens, if the first 3 are true, but just giving an example)\n\n4 confirmations are telling me, its time to buy puts.\n\nNow  nothing works every time, but I guarantee you that in situations like  the one above more often than not you will be right, combine that with  the risk management outlined above and good entries/exits I don't really  see how you cant be profitable. You\n\nThere  are a ton of additional confirmations out there, news, catalysts, L2/L3  (order flow), RSI, MACD, each to his own. The main idea is to have as  many confirmations as you can. Could be as little as 2 but the more you  have, the more likely your trade is going to be profitable.\n\nFor  some this stuff is basic, for others its not. But i do know that are  \u201cgurus\u201d out there who charge $xxxx for this stuff. Now you have the  knowledge and you can pick your own stocks using these setups.\n\nI  have got nothing to sell you, and i plan on writing more stuff like  this in the future if enough people like it, so if you gained anything  from this or enjoyed all i ask is please join my sub [r/theashshow](https://www.reddit.com/r/theashshow/) and if you want learn or talk about stocks do hop into my free discord server.\n\nAnd sub to my Youtube channel, ill start making videos soon!",

Mysterious anonymous creator of [Bitcoin](https://getblock.io/nodes/btc/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo), Satoshi Nakamoto, didn\u2019t introduce his brainchild at a conference or during a YouTube stream.\n\nInstead, he shared a whitepaper for digital gold ([*Bitcoin*](https://getblock.io/nodes/btc/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo)*: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*) with the subscribers of cypherpunks\u2019 listserv. It was a closed group of cryptography and applied math enthusiasts. Adam Back, inventor of Hashcash protocol, video games developer Hal Finney and anonymous \u2018e-money\u2019 creator Wei Dai are the most well-known of them.\n\nIt was Hal Finney who received the first Bitcoin transaction. In 2009-2010, these cypherpunks were the only people contacted directly by Satoshi Nakamoto.
