Big,  babies. One wasn't the brightest guy in the world , used to like to chase cars . I had a big 75 Chevy PU and I was driving down the drive way , Im only 5 feet tall and could barely see over the stearing wheel \\[ ha\\]  I saw him in  the wing mirror and then POOF , he was gone . He got in front of the truck and I dragged him about 150 feet down the drive way . He got right up , but his balls were all scraped up . He quit chasing cars and lived 8 more years :)",
