Because it gives great portfolio diversity. \n\nBitcoin (as well as other cryptocurrencies) is a very speculative asset. Easy to buy and sell, outside traditional regulation makes it perfect to volatility. Because it moves in price like nothing else it is the first to be dumped if something goes wrong or FOMOed when the price goes up like crazy. \n\nBTW, Bitcoin was never supposed to be hedge agains equity. Its purpose is clear - to be hedge agains inflation. It is very clearly stated by protocol (21mil max).",

Dealing with an exchange is a point of trust: you have to trust the exchange that they let you transfer your coins out in the end. That's why it's recommended to NOT let your coins on there for longer periods of time (or any periods, for that matter).  \n\n> I want to see what the balance is, if any. How do I see if there\u2019s any Bitcoin left? Is there a way to determine which of the 2 keys I have is the private or public?  \n\nIt's possible to recognize them because pubkeys and privkeys have different formats, but I can't help with it from my memory right now. You can try importing either of those into a proper wallet like Electrum: https://electrum.org/ (and play around with different ways of importing them, as depending on how your previous wallet was created, it might show a 0 balance even if it's not empty, so you might need to figure out the \"right\" recovery settings.. but it's not that many, so don't worry).",

Maybe a dumb question, but...\n\nDuring the Canada trucker protests, when we saw donations to the cause being frozen by the state, it seemed like Bitcoin's moment to shine, and every other post on social media claimed that 'Bitcoin fixes this!'\n\nBut, to my eyes, it seemed like the solution fell short. While a person could donate to a Bitcoin wallet that was purportedly tied to the protests, that donation didn't do them any good if they had no way to convert that Bitcoin to dollars. Obviously, the recipient couldn't directly use Bitcoin to buy groceries or gas, they'd need to sell that Bitcoin to get money into their bank account, and that transfer to the bank account could be prevented or frozen. Same goes for trying to use a service like PayPal to broker the transaction between a Bitcoin wallet and a store - PayPal can (and will) cave to state pressure in these situations.\n\nI understand that P2P transfers are basically beyond state control, which sounds good in principle, but eventually \\*someone\\* has to transfer that Bitcoin to cash and interact with the regular economy, and it seems to me like that attempted transfer will always be under the control of the state. Is there something I'm missing here?\n\nThanks!",

Start an email that is not specific to your personal information from a privacy oriented provider (proton mail for example). Only use this email for the one exchange account - nothing else. Use strong password formatting/keeping.\n\n2. Use a vpn showing you from a less regulation-oriented country (ex. GT), open an exchange account with a provider that allows for decent daily withdrawal limits for unverified accounts (ex. Kucoin allows <1BTC/day). Always show your activity from that country.\n\n3. Don\u2019t use your phone number (SMS) for verification purposes.\n\n4. Fund your exchange account through sources that don\u2019t know or KYC you. Example, peer to peer, Bisq, Coinshack (<$600/day as of today). All of these sources won\u2019t perform KYC and will allow you to stage value into and out of the cryptosphere. \n\n5. NEVER commingle your new under-the-table activity with KYC end points.\n\nAt least that\u2019s how I would do it, if I was ever gonna do it, not that I have.

You can make one transaction on chain to load up your lightning wallet with \u201ccash\u201d and then use it to make small purchases on the lighting network without having to record it on the blockchain until you run out of funds.\n\nThis way, the blockchain is similar to your bank statement, where you only record one transaction when you take out money from an ATM and daily spendings are done off-chain.",
