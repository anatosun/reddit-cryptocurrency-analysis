They just say \"Oh man bitcoin goes up!\" and then buy something called bitcoin.\n\nIts gotten so bad that many in the btc community actually make arguments that bitcoin wasnt supposed to ever be cash and it was supposed to be a store of value. They WANT expensive fees to stop people from moving it so it goes up, they make ridiculous arguments about block sizes and as a project btc is moving fully forward to being controlled by 3rd parties and transacting on the chain itself will be mostly a memory.\n\nMeanwhile bitcoin cash works as money right now and is the dream Satoshi's whitepaper described literally all it lacks is adoption.",

Given 1 or 2 years more, BCH is going to be flying.  All it has to do is stick to the whitepaper.\n\n> but isn't the war over?\n\nNo.  The war ends when **every single person on the planet makes every single purchase using on-chain cryptocurrency, and fiat has been totally eliminated from the entire world**.  By that metric, the war is just barely beginning.\n\nEven the fact you have to ask \"Is the war over?\" is clear evidence that it isn't.  If it was over, you wouldn't need to ask, and we wouldn't be here to answer \"No\".",

Both of them repeat, mantra-like, that the protocol is \"set in stone.\"  That phrase comes from Satoshi, but is negated by Satoshi's actual actions, which were to continue to revise and improve the protocol.\n\nBSV uses this phrase to justify the changes they've made to turn BSV into a general-purpose data-storage system, which was *not* what Satoshi was building.\n\nBTC uses this phrase to justify their \"soft-fork only\" approach which ensures the chain cannot scale and must be relegated to serve as \"settlement\" for some other payment system which also was *not* what Satoshi was building.\n\nReal Satoshi may have said that the protocol is basically set in stone but that's a vague phrase that doesn't mean much, particular when you consider that Satoshi himself was constantly tinkering with the protocol.\n\nReal Bitcoin isn't a general purpose data store.  Real Bitcoin isn't a settlement layer for a system of intermediary payment routers.\n\nReal Bitcoin is a [Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf).  It's a payment network for fast, peer-to-peer cashlike transactions and low fees.  Even [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org) agrees that \"Bitcoin\" is supposed to work a lot more like Bitcoin Cash than the way BTC or BSV works - check out their homepage, it reads like an advertisement for Bitcoin Cash.",
