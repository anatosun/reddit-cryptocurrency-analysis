            "selftext": "Eth as it is today, is a high utility token. \n\nDespite all the problems within it, such as the high gas fees and mining process, Eth is still loved and adulated by many people for its versatility, including me. But the new upgrade has me more worried than bullish. \n\nOf course, Eth prices are going up, that's beyond the question. It's going to be bought now not just by average investors, but after the upgrade this too will be reflected for mass corporations and companies. Problem is, it might go down the same road that BTC went down on. \n\nBTC is one of the popular coins in the market, and that honestly makes inaccessible. Not only because the 1 BTC is above and beyond what most of us make in a year, but also because it's desirability by so many people makes the price sluggish and inefficient for the average trader. \n\nMost traders nowadays have already understood this, and replaced the strategy of going after major names like ETH and BTC and replacing that with launchpads and launchpools, and many new ones on the market like sol prime offer different benefits like insurance funds, and some like trust offer staggered sells for pre-sale investors. Traders have already moved on, and so should you.\n\nNot saying you should not buy into ETH, of course you should, but curb your expectations",

The only wallets in crypto that cost money are hardware wallets and they are the safest, so once you build up a stack, you should look into getting one.\n\nSome things to be aware of, each wallet will have a seed phrase or private key. NEVER give that out under any circumstances, if you do, your entire wallet will be emptied. Write the seed phrase on paper and store that in a very safe place. Write it on multiple pieces of paper and store them in separate, secure places if you can. Lastly, never store it electronically, not even a screen shot of it.\n\nIf you find cons in your wallet, that you didn't purchase, don't touch them, they are scam coins designed to entice you to try and swap them. If you do, they will compromise your wallet.\n\nIf you have to use your parent to on ramp fiat or off ramp fiat, make sure you pay for the taxes your gains will incur. The tax people in what ever country you reside in will know that a crypto transaction took place and will want your parents to pay any taxes that your trading or farming have incurred, make sure to budget for that so your parents aren't getting a nasty surprise at the end of the year.\n\nGood luck on your crypto journey and stay safe out there.",

Essentially, you place a large sum of money in the app and it invests in different currencies. The catch is that you are unable to pull that money out once u invest (after a year or two) Do you guys think this is safe? Do u have any additional information on this platform? Any help would be greatly appreciated",
