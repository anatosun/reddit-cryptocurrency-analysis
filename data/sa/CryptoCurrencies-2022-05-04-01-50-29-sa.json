            "selftext": "I know there\u2019s a ton of places that accept \u2018crypto\u2019, but they always make it sound like they\u2019re doing me this massive favor, and honestly it just looks like shoehorning; they just want to signal to the world that they are relevant to modern tech. Is there honestly still a place that will truly accept crypto and not make it look like a pity deal? \n\nWorst part about it is that for most cases if just credit rerouting. For most places that currently accept crypto, it\u2019s just basically paying with your credit with extra measures. You still have to go through the same process as you do with your credit card, if not worse. I often get called by my bank and to let me know that someone is buying cryptocurrency with my money. I know. That person is me. \n\nIf someone were to develop the tech, it would go massive. I know this is desired by the market as we have seen be relevant patterns of attempts at it. When Tesla announced that it acceps dogecoin, prices went into overdrive. There was a big spike in Tesla share price, and many cars were ordered using DOGE. As reported by the BBC (https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60001144#:~:text=Tesla%2C%20the%20electric%20carmaker%20headed,after%20hinting%20of%20the%20plans.) this was put into action around Jan 15. And it was considered a high demand announcement at the time. \n\nThere\u2019s a demand for it, yet the technology is still undeveloped. I know there are projects that are high successful in this field like Binance Pay that have come out with a card even and newer projects like exeno(listed shopping merchant on binance pay) that are making a real name for themselves, but this field is a literal gold mine and there are only a numbered set of projects pursuing it. \n\nI\u2019m sure the technology will follow behind and it will gather mass appeal. Until then, those that get it first will be the ones to profit most.",

It\u2019s not just a software problem but a hardware problem.\n\nThat\u2019s why Strike lightning integration into NCR machines is such a big deal. It\u2019s not just \u201cpay with a credit card that sells your crypto\u201d. It\u2019s \u201cpay from anything hooked into lightning and let the merchant decide whether to keep it in Bitcoin or convert it to a stablecoin with Strikes integration with NCR.\u201d This means near zero fees for the merchant making it a superior payment rail even for dollar transactions.\n\nMore than what rails are being used (important too but\u2026), my interest is in building a circular economy. I don\u2019t want to spend Bitcoin unless the merchant has signaled they receive and keep Bitcoin. Otherwise, I\u2019m just complicating my tax life and adding downward pressure on Bitcoins price. I\u2019m excited to use the new lightning integration to buy things at retail stores, but I\u2019m going to use stablecoins not Bitcoin. I\u2019m trying to offload fiat not Bitcoin after all.\n\nIt\u2019s a great way to support the payment rail infrastructure without causing the negative pressure on Bitcoin.",

In the article, they do admit that WBs advice is from the 70s but there is a fundamental difference in the type of asset he is referring to. \n\nWith a traditional stock, there are underlying capitol that the company owns as well as a team running the show. This is not true of BTC. When the price goes down, is BTC really \"undervalued\"  like we could say of a stock, or is it actually worth less than it was previously? I don't know the answer to this, but comparing advice given 50 years ago about traditional stocks and applying that to crypto is a bit dangerous imho. \n\nI am sure there are plenty of applicable analogies between the two but would love to learn from other people about the differences in valuation. \n\nIs BTC actually worth less when the price goes down or is it undervalued at that price?",

Or at least don\u2019t expect to make more than what you\u2019ll be capable of doing with alts.\n\nBTC still makes decent profits. But you\u2019re better off with alts since we consistently saw them do 10x and even 100x on a weekly basis the past bull market.\n\nAnd while alts can be more volatile than BTC, if you know exactly what to choose to invest in and when, you\u2019ll have a much higher chance at making WAY more than you would have initially made with BTC.\n\nLook at HBAR for example. I think they have WAY more potential than Bitcoin especially with HBAR foundation now expanding the ecosystem at an unprecedented rate to the point where they allocated more than $500 million solely for developing the Hedera ecosystem.\n\nI won\u2019t start with that \u201caltcoin season is right around the corner\u201d bullsh#t cause no one is remotely sure about that.

Most scams are done with shady coins on shady platforms and the victims are usually people who are on the gullible side of the spectrum.\n\nThere are staking options that are pretty safe and can rack in a lot of profits in the long term.

            "selftext": "*Samuel Martin:*\n\nIt's no secret that I've been driven by a deep and furious passion concerning the deluge of fraud that has taken over the virtual world industry:\n\n[It\u2019s heartbreaking to see crypto/NFTs destroy something I love](https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaverseOpen/comments/smb6ab/its_heartbreaking_to_see_cryptonfts_destroy/)\n\nI started as a curious observer and I assumed, because of all of the big companies investing in the space, that there was real value.\n\nThe more I discovered, the more I was disturbed by what I saw. The more I looked into the [technical side](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1BiOcClgDVNESaPA3L7bYw?si=2f42603c53854d12), the less value I perceived. Time and time again I observed people were willing to turn a blind eye to obvious issues in order to generate a sense of hype.\n\nEveryone was willing to believe someone else had figured it out but the closer I came to the emperor's chamber the more I realized that he was [wearing no clothes](https://www.bookbrowse.com/expressions/detail/index.cfm/expression_number/605/the-emperor-has-no-clothes).\n\nA little compromise here, a little blindness there and the great deception is formed.\n\nWhere are the people of integrity?\n\nIf you don't know what I'm talking about I suggest reading:\n\n[The idea that NFTs will allow you to take items between worlds is a pipe dream driven by ignorance. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaverse/comments/tz6520/the_idea_that_nfts_will_allow_you_to_take_items/)\n\nNot only that I have noticed that artificial intelligence is being used here on Reddit to write articles in mass to promote the value of NFTs and crypto. It's the same article over and over and over again with synonyms changed. Then these posts are upvoted by bots creating a fake-news cycle supposedly supported by the masses.\n\nHowever, the [more research I do](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaversestartup/comments/tjc6fk/as_a_gamer_i_would_be_less_inclined_to_play_games/) the less human support I see for this hype cycle.\n\nAre we all just being led along by bots?\n\n# Finally, my question:\n\nI really believe in being objective about things and not just taking a position and being unwilling to change your mind. So I have been talking with industry experts trying to probe and find a way to challenge my own idea of the metaverse.There's one thing that I've been unable to refute concerning a possible value for NFTs, and I came here to see what people think:\n\nIn the past it's been very difficult to track the royalties of art sales. Let's say I create a piece of fine art and I want to give it up in exchange for royalties on its sale to a publisher. I want a transparent way to track this art throughout the web and get my royalties.\n\n# Is there any real, serious, legitimate use case for NFTs?",

NFTs might have some of the best utilities between all blockchain technologies.\n\nIts all just hype driven at this point. Although one good thing that came out of this hype is the fact that it introduced so many new people to the cryptoverse and made crypto shine in the mainstream with so many celebrities and major brands entring the metaverse.\n\nI have hopes that eventually NFTs will start being known for their utility especially now with projects like HBAR foundation allocating huge funds for this exact thing. I think they allocated $250 million just for metaverse development on the Hedera network and they\u2019re gonna start making some changes and steering the NFT market towards utility more especially with companies like UbiSoft on the Heder council helping them do so.",

I \n\nstarted investing in late 2020 but didn't sell or trade anything (just bought some BTC and ETH to start). But in 2021 I did a bunch of trading and also took some profits into fiat.\n\nI used Koinly and manually imported my CSV files. Had everything well organized. Had an excel sheet with all my trades and their net profit/loss.\n\nClaimed a couple thousand in capitals gains in turbo tax.\n\nSent everything in to the CRA (I'm Canadian), the wait was stress inducing, what would the audit look like? What if I made a mistake?\n\nWell, on Monday the CRA deposited the money for my return into my bank account.\n\nNothing triggered an audit....I was both happy and actually a little disappointed to tell you the truth.\n\nI'll hold onto everything in case they audit me when I'm a millionaire though! Best of luck this tax season!",

If you buy 10K USD worth of Monero now, and it reaches such prices, it would turn your investment to $100 000.\n\n\nPut it into a low market cap coin that has good fundamentals. \n\n1) Fungibility/Privacy will become more of a need in the future. Other than Monero, what is a low market cap coin that invokes fungibility/privacy and is hard-capped ? \n\n2) Find a unique use case that already exist and succeeded but doesn't have privacy implemented at the protocol level. Think LINK or ETH alternatives, but with privacy. Something like smart contracts or oracle service will need to implement fungibility / privacy at the protocol level and turned on by default. \n\n3) There are only a few coins that meet these criteria. Invest in those that are low market cap.\n\nEDIT: Some of these particular coins are being mentioned on Monerotopia conference right now, and are starting to build traction.",

AVAX go congested. Solana breaks down every other week. Polygon got rekt by a flower picking game.\n\nIf anything, other projects like Hedera have a way high chance of going mainstream cause of how efficient they are especially with HBAR foundation focusing so much on sustainable project development to the point where they\u2019re even allocating $100 million solely for that.\n\nYou have to understand that when I say \u201cmainstream\u201d I\u2019m talking millions of daily active users daily.\nSo unless there\u2019s a permanent solution or fix from the roots up, Ethereum going mainstream is something very far from reality.",

A sidechain is basically another instance of the chain with small changes in the parameters, like for example polygon has sacrificed decentralization to be able to process more transactions and it is using PoS instead of PoW.\n\nLayer 2 solutions on Ethereum as shown on L2beat.com are basically compression mechanisms for Ethereum which allows for much higher throughput. We are currently seeing massive innovation in both layer 2 solutions becoming better at compression and Ethereum as the layer 1 becoming better at supporting layer 2 solutions, this will lead to exponential scaling since if you get 2x improvement from the layer 2 and then also get a 2x improvement from Ethereum you total 4x improvement instead of just 2x if you didn't have the layer 2. Luckily we aren't just seeing 2x improvements but 10-100x on both layer 1 Ethereum layer 2s over the next couple of years. This is progressive prosess and currently scaling is outpacing demand.\n\nL2fees.info let's you see the tx cost on the different layer 2 solutions",

Of course burning is not artificial, but often times, the only purpose is to make supply deflationary in order to increase value in an effort to attract investors.\n\nOn the other hand, a treasury system has much more to offer by incentivizing development on the platform. I think it's a much better use of transaction fees than burning.\n\nYou could argue that attracting investors by implementing a burning mechanic would also attracts developers, but I think that the treasury system will result in a much more sustainable growth by attracting more serious investors as opposed to investors wanting to make a quick buck or even creating a space where people are reluctant of actually using their assets. Theres also the argument that deflationary assets are in some way helping against consumerism which could be a good thing.\n\nOf course this is only my opinion. But at the end of the day, humans will be humans and theres no right answer on this. I think both are good experiments but I personally root for the treasury system because it alligns more with my way of thinking and I think it has more benefits than a deflationary policy. Maybe a combination of both could be good? Could be an interesting experiment.",

We might take DeFi for granted now but a couple years back it wasn\u2019t even a thing.\n\nDeFi as a whole is only 7 years old which is very young compared to other markets with similar market caps.\n\nDeFi literally did a 100x in two years when other markets struggled decades to do anything similar.\nPeople are starting to realize the true benefits and its already showing with these numbers.\n\nIf anything, DeFi is much more efficient and sustainable than traditional financial institutions all while offering a way higher APYs.\n\nAn average savings account offers around 0.1% which doesn\u2019t even fight inflation. Meanwhile DeFi offers APYs in the double digits and this efficiency will keep getting better and better with time especially with so much development in DeFi recently. HBAR foundation for example allocated $155 million just for DeFi development on the Hedera network.\n\nAll of this and more combined will hopefully keep attracting more and more new blood to DeFi and slowly but surely we\u2019ll be headed towards mainstream adoption.",

They also scrap the floor for crypto payments, so payers and recipients of even the smallest crypto transactions would need to be identified, including for transactions with unhosted or self-hosted wallets. Further measures under discussion could see unregulated crypto exchanges cut off from the conventional financial system.\n\n(news report)\n\nI don't  get what they're trying to do lmao, they're trying to accuse crypto of being a money-laundering tool? It won't workout like that for all parties involved. I know that many crypto users in the EU are trying to make a living to be able to afford living even with their job, after taxes and all the losses they have to deal with. My friends over there are making 20x off launchpads like sol prime or even going long on BTC despite its massive uptrend and still can't keep up with the cost of living in the EU. \n\nWhat they're doing will not turn out will and they're losing a financial war from every side.",

I\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s not really deserving of the 3rd spot in market capitalization.\n\nDevelopment there is notoriously slow and dApp integration hasn\u2019t been the best so far as we\u2019ve seen.\n\nThere are many other cryptos that are deserving of this spot. First one that comes to mind is Hedera considering how much HBAR foundation has been focusing recently on expanding the ecosystem with sustainable projects to the point where its allocating $100 million solely for sustainable project development.\n\nHype plays a major role in this market so don\u2019t always follow it. We\u2019ve seen this with multiple projects ranging from meme coins to projects with actual utility.\n\nSo bottom line is, no matter how good or bad a project is, lack/presence of hype will be a major deciding factor in the success/failure of a certain project (at least initially).",

However I've just found out that one of the mining pools is being run by a scam artist (full disclosure, this is heavily held suspicion, rather than fact). I was discussing this on the vertcoin sub reddit when my posts all got deleted. I reached out to a few mods and the drama really started to unfold.\n\nMy posts were deleted by a mod who told me themselves the pool owner had threatened to dox them. This pool owner collected personal information by offering to send free merchandise to people.\n\nIt's a shame, because VTC has been around for a long time and has a beautiful hash algorithm, but avoiding this sort of institutional dealings is one of the reasons I and many others are interested in crypto. So I'm finished with VTC, and I'd advise all others to stay away as well.",

I've seen so many stocks squeeze I don't know what to think, while a lot of companies that are supposed to be dead, come alive, or companies like evergrand that for some reason never really died, even though it's dead in theory. In practice, Evergrand, the company that every time I read about it, seem to have lost another billion or two, just never seem to die. Someone doing an accurate shorting on that company (which I never thought to do, stupid me.) would probably think it should be fully declared bankrupt and not be purchaseable anymore, which it is in IBKR I think at least.\n\nInflation is sort of the same beast, it's an exponential effect through time, with a slow start. I've been invested in crypto for a long time, on and off although, but I had to sell most of my assets last year, because I had no money to buy food or pay rent, even though I bought the cordano a year before as a hedge against inflation. My belief is still this; we are paid shit, most of us, everything increased in costs, but most of us have gotten less hours (I left my job in hopes of a more stable one, although I didn't get any new job, and now I'm living on my savings.)\n\nThe people so far that benefitted from higher prices, they invested in stocks, especially when it has been a bull market and they feel safer with stocks than tokens, we will see a stable rise in crypto when more and more newspapers report on \"higher than before reported inflation\" and people begin to feel that these currencies actually work. So far, bitcoin is too clunky, etheruem too expensive, and cardano is not developed enough to offer anything as of right now. \n\nRemember; crypto is the LAST place people will put their savings in, when everything else fails, so first, everything else sort of needs to fail. That takes some time, like they say, \"Rome wasn't built on one day.\"\n\nIf you believe in crypto, think instead that NOW is the time to invest, it's almost a godgiven time, if an asset is cheaper now than when you first bought it, revise and see if the fundamentals actually changed, or if you just got granted another investing opportunity. For example, my cordano halved in value after I sold them, which made me a bit more happy now, because when I get my check soon, I can buy way more for way less. I still believe in Cordano, even though the market believes otherwise.",

A lot of value is created through scarcity, tangiblity and usability. \n\nTo create value you must have a market waiting to buy your stuff, or someone who'd be interested. Beeple for example was an already established digital artist that had some of the most unique images in on the internet, he had an audience, his NFTs were obviously gonna gain some worth because there was demand behind them. \n\nMost NFT projects don't have much uses or utility, they have the potential to, but for now they don't. So they're running off of scarcity and mainstream attention from how hard the communities that form around them push them forward. Since the value of NFTs at the moment is not based on artistic finesse or creativity. You can make the best art imaginable and it probably won't gain value on the blockchain unless it's picked up by a community that's passionate about it as much as you are. \n\nCryptopunks for example are considered valuable because\u00a0they represent the first NFT collection ever to be created on the ETH blockchain. The images themselves may not be the prettiest, but the fact that there are only 10,000 Cryptopunks means that very few people can own one. \n\n10 thousand is still a large number considering the NFT collections being sold nowadays, but that market of Cryptopunks was established since they were the original broad project that users could own. And there's value, history and scarcity in that. These brand new \"Celebrity nft\" projects and influencer pushed projects are probably never gonna gain any real value. \n\nWhen venturing into the market, it's wise to not gamble on shady projects. Always check if the team has done anything else before and how that did and so on, before taking a chance and if it's their first project it could be risky, always check if they're backed by an insurance fund like on launchpads such as solprime to insure your safety in case of any rogue tactics or rug pulling like what happened with doodle dragons for example. \n\nOverall, keep a realistic expectation on the projects you're getting into. Anything can be turned into an NFT and there's value in that, but be careful not to overpay for something promising to be the next big thing.",

While scams and rug pulls exist in crypto, people scream \"fraud!\" and \"rugpull!\" as soon as a coin starts under preforming. Mostly inexperienced investors. It's annoying. it's like people want to blame something other than themselves for picking a failing project. I've made bad picks, but I don't pick rug pulls. Maybe I'm just lucky.\n\nThe problem I think, is people not being able to spot the tell tale signs of a scam, or how to spot honest projects. People either have that sense, or don't. I've always had a keen sense for spotting bullshit, and fraudulent coins stand out to me quite easily.  I've never got rugged or scammed and I've been in and out of probably 100s of coins. But yes the insurance is a nice option, but again i think that's more for if the coin fails, not \"here's insurance in case we rug pull you\" lol. Or who knows, maybe that's a scam. How did your process of picking this coin differ from all the times you seem to have been scammed?",

He is unhappy with El Salvador\u2019s rollout of Bitcoin as legal tender, which has been riddled with identity theft and volatility. The prospect of governments using the technology to crack down on dissent is why Buterin is adamant about remaining decentralized crypto.

I was also thinking of possibly grabbing a couple interesting NFT's and opensea seems to like metamask and according to their chart metamask allows for buying eth with credit cards so should be simpler than coinbase which is the other wallet im looking at but that one sounds like the database is stored on coinbases servers. or do i have everything completely wrong?\n\nany help would be greatly appreciated thank you!",

But really investing in a new startup or small coin presents a higher risk than reward at most times.\n\nThis is why (and this is before launchpads became a thing) more than 50% of crypto projects would fail without raising a single dollar. Most people lost trust in new projects and new teams. \n\nThe emergence of launchpads made it easy to invest in new tokens, since your guarantee would rely on the reputation of the launchpad itself. Most tokens built on the Binance Launchpad for example lived to see insane highs later on. \n\nBut risk will always be there even if the token is well vetted and presented on a legitimate platform. Because teams can always be motivated by greed to dump the project, rug pull the investors and start another. Some launchpads like sol prime have begun offering insurance fund guarantees because of this situation. \n\nNot only that, but even a legitimate token could be made to look like a pump and dump, That happens when all the investors prior to launch sell at unison immediately at launch... Some launchpads have somewhat solved this with locking token release of private investors or staggering launch sells, but the battle is far from over",

More so then there should have been, especially with trading fees from being so active. Overall I lost a pretty penny at some point going that route. \n\nI\u2019ve definitely moved on to a more long term form of investing and going with time in market and DCA.",

After the unfair battering it has received over the years, let's take some time to use our knowledge lf it to defend everything it's brought the world. \n\nUnfortunately for crypto, first impressions stick for some time. BTC initially gained a tawdry reputation in its early years as the currency of choice for illicit activities \u2014 favored by dark web users, ransomware hackers, drug traffickers and money launderers worldwide.\n\nBut, the world has changed since the first Bitcoin was mined back in 2009. There are now more than 18 million of them in circulation, and more than 90,000 people have $1 million or more stashed away in Bitcoin,\u00a0according\u00a0to cryptocurrency data-tracking firm Bitinfocharts.\n\nNow is the time to recognize that while there are inherent risks, cryptocurrency is also a force for good in the world. In an age of plummeting savings rates, this relatively new asset class offers all of us the opportunity to invest in crypto without traditional barriers that exist in traditional finance, no matter how much or how little money we have available.\n\nThese risks are also dwindling by the day with the introduction of insurance funds on IDO incubators like soIanaprime, the investor is not as in danger as before and there are more safer options available in the market to choose from. \n\nA large number of people do not even have a safe place to store their hard-earned cash.\u00a0According\u00a0to World Bank data, 1.7 billion people globally do not have a bank account. Many of us take for granted the ability to move money around through credit cards and bank transfers, also the ability of sending sending large sums to our friends and family with a tap of our smartphones, but for the unbanked, this is not doable.\n\nLet's not forget that crypto is also democratizing finance. There are low barriers to entry with no need for a broker or a high net worth. Anyone can invest and create wealth for themselves. As a result, people are learning about concepts such as annual percentage rates, lending and borrowing, and the history and purpose of money.\n\nCrypto can also shield citizens from economic turmoil. Venezuela is a prime example where many\u00a0citizens are already suffering high inflation\u00a0and the impact of United States sanctions that also affect their banks. They are increasingly converting their wages into crypto and using the blockchain for money transfers and payments.\n\nFor developing countries, Bitcoin is an excellent way for society to eliminate corruption because the community can track any Bitcoin transaction in the public ledger when people use the cryptocurrency to transfer money.\n\nCrypto\u2019s mainstream acceptance is almost already here, but many people still have unfounded fears we have to overcome to truly push mass adoption forward once and for all.",

Since then I've made a ton of mistakes, and I genuinely wish someone sat me down and taught me some things before I entered here. \n\nFor starters, I wish I knew that no 2 exchanges are the same. Every one has a different quality and a different way it works. Every platform you use is different than the other and that's just something you have to learn early or you'll be stuck trying to fix some things that are features of the platform. \n\nI wish I knew that Bitcoin and Ethereum were not for everyone. I mean yeah they're excellent tokens in their own right, and I've had my share of success of there, but they're not right for everyone. If you were looking for massive peaks of success you are far better off scouring the small caps market. \n\nI wish I knew small caps were risky. Small caps are a huge risk and if you say they aren't you are just lying to yourself. A lot of the time they just end up in rug pulls or are just built that way... Some platforms understand this, and take the necessary precautions, as in the case with Solana prime, but most platforms don't give a damn. \n\nI wish I knew mining is so expensive. I tried my hand in mining early and I went all out on it, Splurging on GPUs and computers trying to get the best result possible. What no one tells you is that there are massive maintenance costs involved in the matter that you will find trouble keeping up with. \n\nI wish I knew more about crypto before I entered, and that's 100% on me, because the internet was there in front of me, I just didn't use it. I should have. If you are new to the market, please educate yourself as much as possible.",

There have been countless stories of people falling for Crypto scams or losing large sums of money through cyberattacks \\[In 2021, criminals stole $14 billion in cryptocurrency\\] ( I hope this helps to reduce fraud and punish those scamming others)\n* The Biden administration also wants to explore a digital version of the dollar, just like China has the Digital Yuan\n* The order also emphasized that the U.S. aims to establish itself as a global leader in Crypto\n* These new regulations could help Crypto become more easily mass adopted, and draw in more institutional investors who were previously hesitant due to legal concerns\n* **Do you think Regulation will accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin?**",

I mean it literally saved me from being stuck in a broken disheveled country, and for that, I am grateful.\n\nI also understand that it has already peaked plenty, of course it will keep rising! But the days of +1000% are far removed from the reality of Bitcoin today. It has become a common staple of the markets and a standard the world relies on, and every day as a result it's getting ever so stable.\n\nThat being said, I have made plenty of immense profits off of it, but for people just entering the market with insane expectations, please face reality, you will make a lot of profit but it'll be nowhere near 2x or 3x...\n\nWhich is why I see many beginners rush the field running towards small tokens and startups. Nothing wrong with that in principle, but people behind these token leverage these people by creating pyramid schemes and false tokens.\n\nOne might see it best to buy new tokens only off a launchpad of sorts, such as solanaprime as now they even have an insurance fund in place to protect their investors. They might even want to avoid small caps all together, but in case they care to venture there, one must take serious precaution.\n\nBe safe out there, face reality head on and limit your expectations.",

He used to talk about \"knowledge\" all the time while making videos in his (you guessed it) garage while posing next to a rented Lamborghini. \n\nSelling overpriced useless courses made him millions and now he's trying to sell NFTs, with overpriced NFT mentorship cards that have different tiers valued as high as 18.4 Ether which give the buyer different access to his \"old garage social club\" and access to Tai himself as in spending time, having a phone call and even having a basketball game with him. So please pay this guy no attention when you come across him and all the similar people cause they're giving the platform a bad scammy image. \n\nIf the genuine startups in the market and the people doing hard work on projects everyday got half the attention that these people get, we'd have a better platform. I'm glad there's IDO incubators like solanaprime are helping up and comers expose their projects more widely to investors. \n\nOverall, always DYOR not just about the projects but about rhe backgrounds of these people if you've never heard of him having a real name attached to project is not enough sometimes, dig in the history.",

And it was good! It was great for the time that it was and I enjoyed it as much as I did. \n\nBut isn't this a risky venture? Couldn't they have chosen some other field to enter instead. I would assume they would go with starting a whole new token that would be accepted in their virtual store or something, and have that token heavily advertised on launchpads such as Solanaprime for example. Or they could've made a Limewire game simply, that relies on NFT gaming tokens. Or maybe even reintroduced the site, now with P2P research at an all time high. \n\nThey could've gone many ways around this, and I fear the NFT route might've been the riskiest.

            "selftext": "I'm often more scared than optimistic whenever I'm trying to enter a new startup or new token, as most scammers find it as a haven for them to produce their diligent and corrupted scams, It's awful how such a world of passionate new token teams is full of rug pulls and scammers. \n\nThis wasn't always the case though, I still remember when this was fairly rare, which is was. Unfortunately, with the rise and power of cryptocurrencies in the markets, it seems it's all going south. \n\nThere's still hope though, because wherever I look on Twitter, when people pay attention and watch teams with an open eye, looking for something wrong, they alert everyone to it as soon as they find it, mitigating the risks within. This is a rare grassroots move unseen before, of people helping each other avoid mass risk and danger, because I still want to invest but I don't need to get rugged every time lmao. \n\nI know there are platforms like the Binance Launchpad where this is still a rare occurrence, and others like Solana Prime where they have an insurance fund in case it goes tits up, but I'm talking about the overall markets in general and how they work. \n\nIt's a shame this is happening to the crypto world, because bad controversy ruins all faith in new coins, and people are more terrified than ever to invest in startups and new tokens. How do you expect any new project to take off without any investors? \n\nHope must still remain, and this is the most valuable thing we can get when we employ any kind of secuirity against scammers and fraudsters,",

Much easier this way than to produce anything of actual value.\nEventually, the coins with actual use cases will get more and more adopted and the useless coins will fall into obscurity, the volatility will settle down, and the get rich quick crowd will look elsewhere. It will take some time though. But that's why big players like BTC call every coin a $h1tcoin because if more new people don't put their money into BTC, the hodlers won't get the big pay day they're looking for. The entire space is just the greater fool theory personified.\nSure you can get rich betting on some random coin and hope you get lucky, but I personally stick to projects with actual real world value and daily use case other than trading and speculation. Hopefully this nonsense will all be a thing of the past in 5 years.\n\nGood post, op.\nu/chaintip",

These projects are turning crowdfunding\u00a0of\u00a0video game projects into an opportunity to invest\u00a0in\u00a0video game projects. This is huge step forward. This is the SolanaPrime IDO dApp which will unleash the untapped potential of a global-scale, metaverse-based economy, monetized via community ownership. Game developers will finally be able to achieve financial success from their passion projects and gamers will be able to actually own part of the game and profit from its success. \n\nThis dApp is designed to be easily accessible to game developers. It will provide them with an opportunity to establish a direct relationship with fans and forward-looking investors, instantly eliminating current obstacles such as funding difficulties and creative pressures. It will allow gamers to move their in-game capital more freely between gaming worlds and the real world. SolanaPrime will facilitate the confluence between real gameplay and true value creation, finally unleashing the substantial power of GameFi. As co-founder Ramiro Gamen stated.\n\nIts looking like a good time to be a gamer in the crypto market.",

So it's really not that hard for someone to figure out your wallet address, especially if you've ever used Fiat because you need an on-ramp for your cash. For those that are completely invisible in this space I commend you, but you are in the vast minority\n\n2) Assuming your wallet address is known, the government can tell you your assets are frozen. That means if you move Crypto in or out of your wallet you go to jail. Sure they can't stop you, but they can watch and arrest you.\n\n3) They want to seize your assets. Same thing, they see your wallet and they tell you to hand over the funds. You resist, you go to jail. They can't actually seize your funds but you still end up in jail.\n\n4) You can flee the country and still use your Crypto, but you'll be on the run and wanted in your own country. Kinda sucks....\n\nThese are the laws that are coming, whether we like it or not. But I would argue they are needed for mass adoption anyways.....so again we arrive at the choice or being completely sovereign or rich.....",

That means there is no chance I can send money home besides via Western Union which have around 10% tax. I cannot also deposit cash to my bank account even if I present my ID and bank account number. My only chance is by Revolut but I still need someone to pay me in revolut, then I can send some money to my account. If it's a working day the money probably will be there by the end of the day, if it's not they will arrive in the first working day. The whole banking system is too slow and out dated to put it in a light words. I hope that someday there will be widespread crypto terminals where I can convert fiat to crypto, but who knows when this will be available...",

When that stops, it's upto the people to step up and make change.   \n\n\nPeople seem to forget that and governments have become some sort of identity that serves only a small handfull of people's interests. We are too busy with our day to day lives trying to survive, being distracted by meaningless bullshit and until we come together and make change for the better, the world will continue to slump into a hellscape.   \n\n\nThe sanctions are supposed to kick start the people into action and also punish the governments by reducing their citizens ability to make money and pay taxes.   \n\n\nWe can't point fingers when basically the entire west has somehow participated in unethical wars/invasions.   \n\n\nWe don't live in an idealogical world and you just have to deal with it.

(I already work with some crypto company already).  \nSo far so good, Startup looks legit, some strong names behind it , remote work, global market. Pretty basic in the cryptospace.\n\nHowever, at some point the recruiter mentioned **I could be paid in stablecoin.** \n\nI need to admit, this is the first time it happened to me, so I am pretty unsure of what to think about it.\n\nAnybody in this sub already tried or is being paid in stablecoins ?\n\nI am curious to know what are the pros and the cons of such move ?\n\nAny **risks towards taxes**, your legal status of employee, unemployment etc.. (In  case bad things happens)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks :)",

            "selftext": "Everyone is on here, I'm talking most about small and beginner crypto users hoping to turn their monthly allowance into a golden nugget, but they are getting rugged in the process. It's because people are so desperate for massive and instant lottery wins that they will chase and hunt down red flag projects, projects that seem too good to be true, as they often are. \n\nPeople are so desperate for massive success that they will fall for a pyramid scheme that offers 40% returns within a month. Do you think that is achievable? Where do you think these projects are using your money for? \n\nI have to admit, this was once me, but I am no longer interested in massive wins. I'd rather go for small consistent, attainable goals. \n\nThe Turtle will win the race. \n\nI invest in a lot of projects, even those that have already peaked, if I'm confident enough to reinvest in them. I got some bags in ELON even though it did 100x last few months, I know it will go up still. I'd rather have +5% every day than a 100x in one month. \n\nEveryone wants the lottery win, but trust me, a windfall is more responsibility than you need to bear. \n\nI have some bags in other tokens like ADA, which I solemnly believe in, and even though it's dipping, I think I will hold on to those until the end. \n\nDon't let your desperate hunt for money eat your soul. It's really about the journey not the final goal.",

I know most people don\u2019t have that, but even the blue-chips 10x practically every year. That was actually around the time when I used my FAFSA check ($3k) to double down on my portfolio of stocks and crypto and 2020-2022 has seen x50 returns for me. I even half-caught the DOGE and Tesla hype, but sold way too early for both (417k coins for $0.08 each smh). Eventually I transitioned all my stock gains into crypto because, besides seeing the ideological and political power it holds, I honestly believe it\u2019s our generation\u2019s stock market and will cause the biggest generational wealth transfer in history. Anyways, these dips don\u2019t bother me anymore, it\u2019s just a matter of time. \n\nI\u2019m 25 now and I\u2019m pretty confident I\u2019ll be a millionaire before 30 if I just keep hodling and DCA.. it\u2019s honestly an exciting feeling, having faith that I\u2019ll have financial freedom like I never thought possible, (I grew up in poverty). Either that, or the bubble pops and I lose everything, ending up back where I started, and regretting that I didn\u2019t buy a Tesla. \n\nLike they say, money comes and goes, but wealth is forever.",

I understand completely how transactions on the blockchain can be tracked on a transaction-level simply by examining where (other wallets) the transactions come from and go to.\n\nHowever, let's say that .gov is coming after me for having an American flag waving from the cab of my Mac truck as I drive across the US.  I've bought or been gifted $BTC via an intermediary like Coinbase (boo) or [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com), then transferred those funds into a software or hardware wallet off-net. Yes, there's a trail of where those assets went; however, without a good key/password, how exactly do those funds not sitting vulnerably at an intermediary get \"seized\"?\n\nAs a side note, feel free to tell me how a transaction-based mechanism like the blockchain is anonymous as relates to funds and where they go; Yes, I understand my name isn't on my wallet, but the funds are 100% trackable and current location (wallet) \\*is\\* known.\n\nThanks, and I appreciate any input, black helicopter or legit.\n\nSteve",

The resource usage. Yes, so many other industries waste a ton of resources, but is it ethical to add so much more? How do we mitigate resource usage for the future? How can it be made sustainable?\n\nI'm not trying to spark debate or say \"crypto bad\". I'm looking for honest, viable answers as to how these issues can be resolved.

But in the past year I\u2019ve noticed that crypto somehow has become incredibly politicized. \n\nAs guy who considers myself to be fairly \u201cleft\u201d oriented politically, it can be funny, to downright frustrating and disheartening to see how rapidly crypto has been painted as some anti-environmental,  right wing boogeyman that is only for \u201ccryptobros\u201d. The most ridiculous part of this, is, most people who take these stances have almost little to zero understanding of cryptocurrencies AT ALL. And won\u2019t even listen to any sort of conversation about it. I\u2019m not even talking about trying to get people *in* to crypto I\u2019m just trying to explain to people that me DCA\u2019ing into projects I like doesn\u2019t make me some \u201cchud\u201d hell bent on destroying equality and our planet. \n\nIt has been very eye opening, as someone who is considered \u201cliberal\u201d to watch all my peers who pride themselves on being thoughtful and data-driven, mindlessly parrot propaganda-tier talking points anytime crypto is brought up. Do many of you experience this? Do you have any links or counter arguments to the age old \u201cbitcoin mining is destroying the planet\u201d, I find it hard to believe that crypto mining is more harmful than the mass production of consumer targeted personal use vehicles or factory farming, (but am of course open to being wrong about this)",

Me driving my car, in fact the entire total of all the cars driving around in the world, is a drop in the bucket compared to the CO2 and waste produced by the MANUFACTURING of cars, and manufacturing plants in general. So me running one computer with a couple of GPUs is like nothing, it uses barely any more power than just running a normal computer all day.\n\nAre you a monster for enabling the industry by participating in it with trading? How is that any different from buying a car, or eating meat, or buying/using any product that was built in a factory? This doesn't make any of these things okay, but where do we draw the line? \n\nCrypto only seems to stand out because it doesn't generate anything of intrinsic physical value, but in my mind neither does the minting of physical money, which like crypto has value for its function in mediating a global trade system.\n\nThe problem here is that we've arrived at a \"well you're just as bad!\" argument which doesn't accomplish anything, and if you are invested in the future of crypto you actually SHOULD be critical of its environmental impact in order to force innovation. The system we have is far from perfect but that doesn't mean we should destroy it entirely, the core idea of crypto currency is a very good one it just needs (a lot of) work on the execution.",

It was always a bit of a dull roar in the background, but now it seems like \"cryptocurrency\" has become synonymous with \"scam\" in the popular view. There's thread after thread of people raging about companies trying to make use of blockchains in various ways, and whenever I try to simply inject a little technical information (not even promoting anything in specific, just explaining \"this is how such-and-such works\") I get downvoted and excoriated as a scammer or a \"cryptobro.\"\n\nPeople enjoy righteous indignation. They love being part of a mob that's persecuting a deserving target. There's camaraderie, they're fighting the good fight, they're *heroes*. So if you try to point out \"hey, maybe you're wrong about some particular detail of what's justifying your rage\" you become the enemy. You're threatening to harshen their buzz.\n\nI mainly reassure myself by observing that this is a common, repeating pattern in human nature. Eventually the endorphins from repeated NFT-bashing will become stale. Eventually Ethereum will switch fully to PoS and the environmental boogeyman will lose his hold (sorry, Bitcoin). It's going to cost a lot of opportunities along the way, but if a blockchain application is truly advantageous then eventually someone will take advantage of it. I just found out that in November cryptocurrencies accounted for 3.7% of global equity, I really don't see the technology going away as a result of some ignorant anger on internet fora.",

Bitcoin mining is bad for the environment and provides way less utility than personal vehicles, that's a terrible comparison. Bitcoin is a store of value at best. Functionally it does nothing, the vast majority of bitcoin owners just hold it. \n\nMost new blockchains have moved away from POW because of how energy intensive it is. That doesn't make crypto bad, but Bitcoin mining in its current form IS bad for the environment.\n\nIt's also very clear to me that the crypto community is dominated by right wing libertarians. The loudest supporters of crypto are to the right and the loudest politicians in support of crypto are some of the most right wing in the nation. We can fool ourselves, but the early adopters of crypto have been people with right wing libertarian views. I think its obvious to see why it would attract people with those political beliefs.\n\nThose things are true, you'll have to reconcile that with yourself. None of that means that crypto or blockchain is bad. Blockchains are just another tool, they can be used to help monitor, direct and clean up the environment. A tool is neither good nor bad.",

Bitcoin mining is bad for the environment and provides way less utility than personal vehicles, that's a terrible comparison. Bitcoin is a store of value at best. Functionally it does nothing, the vast majority of bitcoin owners just hold it.\n\nI think you need to look more closely at:\n\n1) The greenhouse cost of the banking transactions industry (it is about 1000x worse than crypto!)\n\n2) BTC's primary mechanism is wealth transfer between countries, and it's valuation is pegged to the value of service provided by Western Union.\n\n3) I agree otherwise, just adding more data",

I find the space to be very overwhelming being someone who hasn't invested at least 5-figures into the space. I'd like to get into more of the defi side of things and leave the relative safety of cefi. What are some projects that I can try with a fairly low investment ($100-200 range) so that I can learn more about the process. I've considered starting an Axie scholarship, and expanding that if it proves profitable, but beyond that I'm torn. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",

Caz I wanted to play around with small amounts of crypto B4 I started moving large amounts so I wouldn't loose everything just trying to understand how it works.\nIf the US is taxing every single trade even if they only all total a few hundred dollars isn't that unfairly making it harder for the average person to invest in crypto n future the progression of this new tech. And won't this also cause a huge backflow of tax reports the already overwhelmed government will have to account for and process, causing them huge amount of money and wasting their time better spent elsewhere?\n\nLike shouldn't there be an amount, like a few thousand or something that can be allowed traded/sold every yr. that if u fall under u don't have to report? Wouldn't that save the gov. time and money from having to process that tax info. along with helping the avg. person who's interested in crypto to educate their self and b able to make responsible investment for their future? Wouldn't this also help the further progress of crypto & it's tech. that would ultimately help the US economy and help make it's citizens wealthier by allowing a \"grace amt.\" they are allowed to play around with to help familiarize & educate their self?\n\nBecause not only does the US tax any trades or sales but u also get charged fees for trading/selling. And then most ppl starting out are most likely going to loose money on their trades caz they have no idea what they r doing or how the market works. Not only that but most of these people are taking a huge risk investing their money in crypto because it's so volatile and new it's extremely easy to loose over half ur investment or have ur investment stolen by cyber criminals or scammers that the US doesn't seam to even b trying to regulate. And unless ur extremely wealthy loosing half or all of ur crypto investment is a huge financial hit, so if the avg citizen is taking on all this risk on something with the potential to greatly impact our economy and further tech. why is the US not alot more crypto-friendly?",

I had 2fa on, I only log onto this account on my computer and laptop. my pass and trading pass are not on a cloud or on my computers. i have no idea how this could have happened.\n\nI contacted KuCoin support but i feel doubtful that they can do anything to help, especially since this happened 3 days ago. i hope i\u2019m wrong and i hope they can retrieve my funds or at lease compensate me. Will they be able to do anything? Anyone have any similar experiences?",

Every investment company, like Blackrock for instance, is audited daily at market close to make sure they are within investment percentages written into their mandate. It ensures portfolio diversity. For a newer asset class, first the compliance team has to be convinced that it will pass audit. Infrastructure in the form of audit programs had to be created for cryptocurrencies because the previously didn\u2019t exist.\n\nThis is like a double win. A major auditing firm has added bitcoin to its treasury. This paves the way for institutional adoption!! These companies manage trillions of dollars each. Imagine them taking a 5% allocation. Just the top ten investment firms by assets under management (AUM) alone manage $33 trillion dollars. A 5 percent stake of ONLY these is $1.65 trillion. Its a bigger deal than has caught on yet.

            "selftext": " \n\nIt's really the endless new listings that get people I think. For every coin, you feel compelled by FOMO to look deep into it, read all the Reddit posts, read blogs, etc. It's incredibly draining on your time and emotions, and it's insane how quickly you'll lose your bearings and constantly second guess yourself with each new piece of information.\n\nHaving a reasoned-out NO list will help you efficiently eliminate possibilities.\n\nSample examples from my NO list **(just my personal opinion, don't kill me pls)**:\n\nMetaverse:\n\n* I can't see how this would tremendously transform our experience of the digital world in a way that would make the overhead (hardware and software-wise) worth it. It simply has to be overvalued as it is.\n\nWeb 3.0:\n\n* \"Build it and they will come\" does not work in the business world (read the Lean Startup)\n* .Our internet arose far more organically. Hundreds of protocols from hundreds of different companies were continuously refined, they withstood the test of time. They were then eventually standardised into the web we have today.\n\nNotice the asymmetry. Saying no to an entire trend like metaverse allows you to avoid the process of deep diving into every metaverse and metaverse-related coin, rank them on their positive attributes and decide how much to invest. At most, you only have to look into a few coins to get an idea of a trend before placing it on your NO list. Without a NO list of trends, your FOMO-driven-ever-expanding-YES-list-of-coins will completely derail you.\n\nAlso notice that a strong list of positive criteria naturally appears as the inverse of the reasons you write down in your NO list.\n\nAnother related tip,\n\nIn the event that a coin that you didn't see potential in moons, you should be able to turn around and say to yourself that with the knowledge you had at the time, you made the right decision, the people that chose to buy in either knew more than you (which is fine, remember it's a continuous learning process) or got lucky.\n\nHope this makes sense.\n\nEdit: formatting",

Impermanent loss is a concept used in liquidity provisioning, e.g. in decentralized finance. \n\nLet's say you anticipate a lot of demand for people wanting to swap CoinA for CoinB, and vice versa. You'd like to benefit from all that trading activity by collecting a portion of the trading fees from a decentralized exchange like Uniswap, Sushiwap, Cronaswap, etc. Let's also say people are exchanging CoinA to CoinB today at a rate of one CoinA to two CoinB. Maybe you put 100 of CoinA and 200 of CoinB into a PancakeSwap liquidity pool. People using that liquidity pool for their swaps pay a swap fee into the pool, which increases the value of your share of the pool. After a few weeks, your share of the pool might be worth 101 CoinA + 202 CoinB while the exchange rate is still 1:2.\n\nNow imagine that interest wanes in CoinB relative to CoinA. People are now swapping *three* CoinB to get one CoinA. Each swap that buys (takes) CoinA from the pool puts in an equal value of CoinB ... more than it used to. The 1:3 exchange rate means your share of the pool is now tilted toward less CoinA, more CoinB ... maybe you're now entitled to 77 CoinA and 231 CoinB. You gained in the less valuable asset and lost in the more valuable asset. That's impermanent loss. \n\nIf you withdraw from the pool, your impermanent loss becomes permanent. If you remain in the pool, your impermanent loss could reverse, or it could increase. This is a risk liquidity providers must accept.\n\nFor more, browse r/defi.",

            "selftext": "# What is it?\n\nDAO stands for **Decentralised Autonomous Organisation**. At its core, a DAO is a smart contract. A piece of code which defines the rules of how the organisation should run. Unlike traditional organizations, there is no hierarchy to DAOs. To align interests of the organization with that of its members, DAOs incentivize their users to achieve their goal. A key distinction from traditional organisation is that the control is decentralised.\n\n# How to form and use it?\n\n1. Establish a cause\n2. Funding phase\n3. Governance\n\n# Benefits\n\n* Transparency\n* Decentralisation\n* Strong Community\n\n# Downsides\n\n* Bugs in code\n* Delays from voting\n\nI made a 6 min video going into more details about each of these aspects and how are DAOs being used today.

Under the current system, El Salvador was condemned to survive by begging for aid from the IMF or the World Bank.\n\nNayib Bukele understood the why of Bitcoin and decided to seize this opportunity to change the future of El Salvador and its people. The people of El Salvador overwhelmingly support Nayib Bukele in what he is trying to do for the country.\n\nEl Salvador's bold choice has already changed the way the country is seen around the world. Everyone is talking about El Salvador and more and more entrepreneurs will be coming to El Salvador to participate in this experiment of building the first Bitcoin Nation.\n\nWho knew where El Salvador was before Nayib Bukele made this choice? Very few people. No one was talking about El Salvador. Bitcoin is already a game-changer for El Salvador and this is clearly just the beginning.\n\nWhile the IMF or the World Bank scoffed at Bitcoin a few years ago, now these institutions are getting scared by the growing possibility that the Bitcoin experiment will succeed in El Salvador and motivate other countries to follow Nayib Bukele's path.\n\nTonga is talking about adopting Bitcoin by the end of 2022, as are other countries in South and Central America. In short, something is happening and the IMF feels the danger mounting for its obsolete system.\n\nRather than letting the people determine for themselves, the IMF is threatening El Salvador saying the country must abandon Bitcoin. The IMF's threats only justify, in my opinion, the very existence of Bitcoin and the absolute necessity for the world to have this alternative system available.\n\nSince El Salvador will logically refuse to obey the IMF, what's next? Will America eventually orchestrate a coup in El Salvador to overthrow the government and end the Bitcoin experiment? How far are the powerful people in the current system willing to go to prevent countries from expressing their free will in monetary and financial matters?\n\nEl Salvador must continue to resist outside pressure, and other countries that will opt for the Bitcoin system in 2022 must do the same. The world is changing, and the first countries to adopt Bitcoin will be the ones to benefit the most in the future.",

So many noobs in over leveraged positions getting rekt triggering a cascade of sells. Factor that in with the fact that btc is coupled to all altcoins on major exchanges and thats when you get this horseshit. It makes 0 sense that Xrp, ada, or ETH, or any other asset should lose value just because the biggest shitcoin of them all is being dumped by overzealous billionaires and overleveraged noob traders.",

Because if what have happened previously, it does not necessarily will repeat. In other words if larger proportion of bitcoin is in a hlod, or just for trading purpose then those who actually use it as a money just stops using it as money, and it value drops to zero. Traditional stock market or fiat is based on some value even it is artificial, or on company capacity to produce. Then, yeah it is nice post but you cannot compare it with traditional stock market. But bitcoin or any cryprocurrency just need to not be used and it loses its liquidity, you are being left with expired currency as it would be in fiat case. \n\nCorrect me if i'm wrong.",

I also know that that a lot of rich individuals, companies (like MicroStrategy) and even countries (like El Salvador) it buying bitcoin, but still I see some risk factors that makes me question bitcoin's future:\n\n1. As we have some very big whales such as Max Kaiser which can probably move and manipulate the market for decades to come, why would even more countries and such move to bitcoin and risk being at the mercy of such individuals? \n2. Despite bitcoin's superb, unique qualities (ref the five pillars) which does solve some real problems for real people (especially in developed countries), why would we assume that Bitcoin will continue to be the crypto dominating this space, and not being replaced by another crypto for this segment of bitcoin users? I mean, bitcoin is great and all, but being the first (and as of now the biggest) in the market for say hedging against government induced hyperinflation, doesn't mean it will stay this way.\n3. If you subscribe to the notion that fiat money per definition is doomed due to inflation and government control, it's possible that bitcoin will remain an investing hedge by (wealthy) individuals and companies, and  not become the money of the future. If so, it's possible that bitcon remains just a regular investment asset along side stocks and so forth. \n\nI'll stop there, but I hope you see where I'm going with this. For me, there's a lot of ifs when it comes to the future of bitcoin, and a lot of resources I find online seems to totally ignore risks like the ones I mention above, so I though I'd reach out to the crypto community to get some input.",

So I sold my crypto and fed it all to the bears I\npanic sold. I broke even and felt a little relief. Then when the market rebounded as\nit always has. My meager 2K that I got back would have been 300K. \nBut I was fine. I had a job. Paid my bills.\nAnd what crypto I owned was owned and it was mine. What I really owned was\nhope. And when I sold it I owned nothing that had the potential to change my life.\nJust the day by day grind. Losing it would not have been the end of the world. But\nselling was the end of that exhilaration and excitement of what might have been. I\ndidn't have the metal. You see I owned BTC, ETH and more. We all know where\nthose went and how it is now. So Now when Once I buy I consider the money\ngone. When I do buy crypto now I hold. I'm in this until the bitter end. Or a\nglorious future. I will not feed the bears my hope. So I will keep mv head down and\nstay silent. I won't give others a reason to bash me when crypto is in the red. On\nthe other hand when crypto climbs (as it inevitably always does) when I am asked\nhow did you do it. I will also remain silent then also. It's a long line that will belittle\nwhen the bears feed.

Suffice to say, I lost a lot of money during that time as I invested a good chunk during all time highs. When it crashed, I had lost quite a bit of money. Luckily, I was still young and thought I had learnt from my mistakes and decided to carry on.\n\nFast forward to April 2021; I made back my losses and was finally making a profit. I thought to myself: why not start investing in crypto? So I invested $700 straight into ETH. But other than BTC and ETH I knew nothing about crypto and thought maybe I should figure this out. I downloaded and opened the Binance app and was instantly overwhelmed: where would I start? Shortly after a buddy of mine came to me and mentioned how he and some other guys were making a crap ton of money investing in something called Safemoon. I was immediately convinced and had $1,000 ready to invest. \n\nThen came the instructions\u2026 \n\nMy goodness what a process. What the hell is a pancake swap? Poocoin? Is that for real? Many moons later I figured it out. Nothing can compare to the stress of transferring your crypto from one exchange to another without knowing if it will actually go through. But it did, and all was well. I invested that $1,000 into Safemoon and thought \u201cokay I\u2019ll see where I\u2019m at next week\u201d. Well I looked the next day and my wallet was up a couple hundred bucks. Was crypto really that easy? I don\u2019t care, I was up. I decided to wait it out and see what happens. \n\nFast forward a few months and I came across R/Cryptocurrency. Oh hey, maybe I can talk about Safemoon and learn about other stuff here. Little did I know was I invested in what was known as the Darth Vader of crypto, the dark side, probably the worst possible investment I could possibly make. So I listened and cashed out my $1,500 (more or less) of Safemoon and decided to start off fresh. I thought that more research in this BSC space was necessary since it seemed to be a popular up and coming place with lots of room to grow - it was also a place that everyone in R/Cryptocurrency told me not to go. \n\nThe next place I decided to put my money in was a relatively new BSC token that paid BUSD rewards. Why the hell not? So I went and put in $1,500 into EGC, yet another token that the R/Cryptocurrency absolutely LOVES. \n\nWell let me tell you something, that $1,500 investment made me $6,000 faster than almost any investment I\u2019ve ever done in my life. This BSC stuff is for real. So I dug deeper in my research. \n\nWhat I had learnt was that most BSC  investments aren\u2019t going to take you anywhere. Many CAN earn you a profit only if you know WHEN to sell. One wrong move can spell the end of your investment. Therefore one strategy I had followed was to do as much research as I could on a specific project that interests me. If I felt that project was legit, I\u2019ll throw some cash into it (ideally before launch on pinksale). Upon launch, I\u2019d wait for the quick 2-3x and sell my initial investment. Simple as that! Now be forewarned that doesn\u2019t always work. There will always be those that don\u2019t shoot up, there are those that drop on launch and then there are those that are rug pulled. I have had all situations happen to me, but luckily, I have made at least 2x gains more often than not because (I believe) of the research I do beforehand. \n\nNow about these tokens I invest in; let\u2019s be honest, Most are a copy cat of the one I invested into previously. The code is the same, the rewards are the same, utilities may be similar. So what\u2019s the deal? The truth, to me at least, is that this is a new game and everyone wants a piece of the pie. Everyone wants to be the best and brightest newcomer with something new to offer. Safemoon did that, then EGC did that with the BUSD rewards and now others are following along all with a tweaked approach. \n\nNot to say this is bad. How can it be bad if I\u2019m making money? The truth is that there are some teams out there with an amazing background with some great devs working behind the scenes. Two that come to my head are RematicEGC and Y-5 Finance; both teams are run by outstanding individuals with a great core team around them and amazing communities. They are two of the main reasons why I decided to put this piece together. This does not ignore the fact that many and most projects don\u2019t have the leadership or flat out ability to move forward and will probably fail miserably. We\u2019re going to see a lot of that; Probably 95% of these tokens will cease to exist in the near future. And you know what? That doesn\u2019t phase me one bit because I\u2019m in the business of making money. And tokens like RematicEGC and Y-5 are helping me do just that.\n\nFine, most people here want a stable investment; but who doesn\u2019t? That\u2019s theoretically impossible. You never know what the almighty Bitcoin and etherium have in store for us tomorrow. There are so many people in this world that have lost millions in those two coins alone over the past few months. And yeah, you\u2019re going to respond to me by saying \u201cyeah, f*ck Bitcoin I\u2019m in sol\u201d, or mana or whatever the hell else you decide is a \u201csafe\u201d investment. \n\nBut let\u2019s be real, no investment in crypto is safe. Some ARE safer than others but that\u2019s when you have to look at risk vs reward. \n\nNow looking at the tokens that get shit on by this entire sub: the Safemoon, the egc\u2019s, etc. There\u2019s been some shady stuff going around about them but you know what? We probably know more about these guys than we do Bitcoin. For all we know; Bitcoin can just be one giant rug waiting to be pulled however since it\u2019s adopted by the masses we refrain from thinking that for btc as much as we would for Safemoon. \n\nAll in all, I\u2019m not going to give numbers, but these BSC investments got me thinking differently about how I am going to invest my money going forward because I\u2019ve probably made more in the last 6 months than I have the last 6 years on the stock market. Will this last forever? Probably not. But I can\u2019t get greedy. I have to continue to follow my plan to a T to ensure I don\u2019t get carried away and not take in profits. But until then, I\u2019ll keep trucking along making money I didn\u2019t think possible with the likes of Y5, Rematic, EGC and Safemoon while many continue to keep calling them scams and rug pulls. \n\nAll fine by me.",

Save time. Prevent emotional gambling.\n* **How:** Use AI & ML technology  \n\n\nCreating a **profitable trading bot** in crypto is extremely hard. And that's normal since analytical trading and algorithms that use it are pretty much pointless. You can't tame the **volatility of Bitcoin (BTC)** and other alts by using Forex indicators.\n\nBut what you can do is fight fire with fire. Or in our case, **fight technology** with another **technology**. **Artificial intelligence** and **machine learning** are making an impact on countless industries already. ***And they may turn out to be the key to profiting in crypto.***\n\nRelated: [Interview with the brain behind One Button's AI/ML trading bots.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4ewR6Nm0Yo)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Success:**\n\n*119,409 days of real-life trading time later. Add a couple of thousands of investors' accounts, and here is what we can say about the platform:*\n\n* proven to protect your portfolio during bear runs. **Source:** [Twitter](https://twitter.com/onebuttontrade/status/1485985448640286722)\n* can outperform BTC and ETH over long periods. **Source:**  [Medium](https://medium.com/onebuttontrade/the-66-days-bitcoin-experiment-85633181fd63)\n* \\+40% against **Bitcoin** alone in the last 6 months. **Source:** [Medium](https://medium.com/onebuttontrade/one-button-becomes-invite-only-c3f248850716)\n* tracked over 187 case studies in the previous year. **See** [35 case studies of BTC vs AI.](https://medium.com/onebuttontrade/35-case-studies-of-bitcoin-vs-ai-ml-trading-bots-e87fc5404a0e)\n* backed up by over **12,000 investors** and seasoned **crypto-traders**\n\nA total of 8 AI trading bots made it into the final roster for public use. Many more were discharged or left for future development.  \n \n\nBut the ones that made it out to the all-stars team are something else. Instead of going with their technical names, the team decided to give them a playful spin.  \n\n\nHorizon, Performer, Astral, Clipper... are just a few of the wacky names that these **trading bots** have (their images are even sweeter). But don't let their appearance fool you - these machines are designed to kill. Oooor at least to **beat the crap out of the market** when opportunities occur.  \n \n\n**Shutting Down:**\n\n*The small dream of creating a profitable crypto trading bot turned into a big company in less than a year. At its peak, the total assets under management reached $14.000.000, and that's just from a handful of users.*  \n \n\n***But now the dream is moving in a new direction...***  \n\n\n* registrations are **closing down** (to get in, you'll need to be invited)\n* a lighter app will be released next month (**100% automation**)\n* Binance Futures bot is in the final testing phase (**shorting bots** are arriving)\n* Two limited **lifetime subscription plans\\*** are available (infinite access to everything) \n\nAnd probably a lot more is cooking in the backend from the Internet entrepreneurs.\n\n \n\n**What does this mean for you:**\n\nRegistrations are free until the end of the week. You may be an experienced trader, a crypto rookie, or a non-believer. But in exchange for your email, you can **lock** your spot on the app forever.  \n \n\nIf you happen to love your test drive and feel the need for getting more bot slots, you can always upgrade your plan. In either case, you'll get invited to a Discord server where you can exchange ideas with other well-minded crypto enthusiasts.   \n \n\n**\\*Disclaimer about the lifetime subscription plans:**\n\nSpending a lot of money on trading software should be thought out thoroughly. Since creating a FOMO in crypto has been shown to produce more negatives, the OB team decided to give a 90 days warranty to the two packages to prevent bad decisions.  \n \n\n***If your bots underperform the market over the next 3 months, you'll get your money back.***  \n\n\n**Closing thoughts:**  \n \n\nStay safe, trade mindfully, and if you happen to use any trading software make sure to do good research on the project before buying anything.",

They go on to show that the M1 money supply has exploded in the USA and have corellated that with the recent inflation. They also tell us to look back to the 80s for the last example of this.\n\nIf this is true, why is inflation worse in almost every other country right now? Also, the M1 money supply was stable 30 years ago when inflation hit so I am not getting the correlation there either. I feel like the primary drivers of inflation today is probably not \"printing\" fiat.\n\nBesides that, money is supposed to be inflationary according to my understanding. If it wasn't, there would be no need to invest. You could just sock cash away under your mattress. The problem with doing that is if money's future value is always higher than its current value, nobody would be spending it. \n\nThink about BTC as a currency. Volitility aside, why would I use BTC for purchases if I knew that later it would be worth more? Most people wouldn't and currently don't, right? They either speculate with it or hold. This isn't good for a currency since it doesn't make sense to use it today and miss out on tomorrow's potential profits. Currency being inflationary keeps it circulating like a hot potato and encourages investment in other assets that have function beyond what cash can do, like moving your wealth into the future or growing wealth. In other words, cash isn't designed to make you rich, it's designed to circulate. \n\nA lot of people talk poorly of inflationary assets but again, if the purpose of a digital asset is to be a currency replacement, I think this is a strong feature that would lead to adoption and use more so than a deflationary model.",

This was widely and openly discussed during the '08 financial crisis response. The same thing was done as a counter to COVID/lockdowns, which is why there is now rampant inflation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Besides that, money is supposed to be inflationary according to my understanding.

Many of the issues with the modern economy that people complain about (lack of savings, everyone feeling \"squeezed,\" the entire economy including access to college, home and car ownership, etc being based around debt) are a direct result of this intentionally inflationary monetary policy.",

I am earning some money from my job every month, and the only thoughts I have about it is to invest it. Then I think about how I could pay for holidays with my friends, and my mind tends to say \u00ab\u00a0you aint got money for that\u00a0\u00bb, while in fact I have, but I want to invest it, maybe because of a FOMO.\n\nAnother example which is also a bit different; I have been thinking of buying a \\~800$ camera for my bday, but every time I think about it, I just can\u2019t really get over the fact that this money would be better invested.\n\nI feel like I am slightly starting to chose to invest money instead of using it to enjoy myself.\n\nI was wondering if any people here thinks like that and how it might have impacted your life, would it be in a good way or in a bad way ?",
