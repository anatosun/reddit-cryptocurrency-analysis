As I know, there are many wallets in the market but I need one which supports important and not-important coins and tokens like memecoins. I saw a wallet called Prokey which supports many of them and I may decide buy this. Do you have any experience using this wallet? How is it? Should I buy Prokey or Trezor and Ledger?\nTrezor and Ledger are well known and I could find many contents and FAQs on the web but this Prokey wallet looks to be new in the market.\nThats why Im asking this question here and I really need your help and experiences.",
