Imagine if towards the end of the quarter Bitcoin dips and a large amount of these companies revenues are wiped out. That would cause huge panic in the market.\n\nI expect that eventually, if crypto goes mainstream, we\u2019ll start seeing stablecoins top the market cap list along with current stablecoin minting leaders like OIN Finance.\n\nI know this opinion isn\u2019t \u201csexy\u201d or popular in anyway but comon, we all know that it\u2019s the more realistic opinion here.",
