Still, it seems to be almost out of steam. \n\nIf the broader crypto market continues to recovery from its depths today, expect this consolidation below .13 to quickly become a springboard. Then, we\u2019ll break through that resistance in the .13 and .14 levels. \n\n It\u2019ll be off to the races again as the hot money jumps back  in to finally enjoy the Elon Twitter bump and lock in those gains. His purchase of Twitter has truly improved the odds of Doge becoming an integrated part of humanity for years to come.",
