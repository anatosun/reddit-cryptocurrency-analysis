So what incentive would people (less so retail investors than big money boys, but still both) have to invest if their money was holding its value just fine? People would still spend money with a deflatiinary currency, sure- you don't just stop wanting things- but I have to imagine a deflationary currency would suppress investment activity in some proportion with the rate of the currency's deflation.

Watching the Bitcoin conference gave me extreme validation that Ethereum was the right way to invest the last 5 years of my life. Couple this with the problems the Bitcoin network has with its security budget and the Bitcoin communities intentionally stunted and slow-to-move development, means that it will likely not solve the problem in time. Most bitcoin maxi's don't even acknowledge the problem yet.",

            "selftext": "A lot of people use centralized exchanges to stake small amount of ETH, but thereby they give them custody over their coins.\n\nThere is actually a very easy way to stake ETH in your own wallet decentralized, without any lockup and with mininal fees of only a few dollars. \n\nIt works through layer 2 Arbitrum and the decentralized staking pool Rocket Pool!\n\nFirst you need to get ETH to your Arbitrum account. Most big centralized exchanges support withdrawals to Arbitrum, for example Binance or Crypto.com. If you have ETH on mainnet, there is also a bridge from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum, but using centralized exchanges to bridge will be cheaper for gas.\n\nYou can now use metamask to access your arbitrum account. [Here](https://help.uniswap.org/en/articles/5538707-how-to-connect-to-arbitrum) is a tutorial on how to connect your metamask to the arbitrum network.\n\nAfter you can access your Arbitrum funds on metamask, there is only one thing left to do: Go to Uniswap and swap your ETH to rETH (Rocket Pool ETH) \n\nYou can do that through this link: [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0xec70dcb4a1efa46b8f2d97c310c9c4790ba5ffa8&chain=arbitrum). (You might have to switch the network to Arbitrum on Uniswap first)\n\nThe swap will only cost around $2 dollars on Arbitrum. So you pay less than $5 total in fees, including the exchange withdrawal.\n\nThe value of rETH will automatically increase over time compared to ETH, because the staking rewards that are earned through staking in Rocket Pool automatically flow into the value of rETH. At the beginning of Rocket Pool, 1 rETH was equal to 1 ETH. Right now, 1 rETH = 1.02 ETH. \n\nIf the staking pool earns 5% staking rewards every year, the rETH/ETH ratio will go up by 5% in the same amount of time. Thats how you earn your staking rewards.\n\nYou can swap your rETH back to ETH at anytime to 'unstake' your ETH.\n\nTo get more information about rocket pool, check out the [official website](https://rocketpool.net/).",

Legislation has not changed and what they have here is very thin. Let me put it differently: if they wanted to tax staking rewards from rETH they would have to analyze exactly what the token does. There are thousands of tokens with the weirdest tokenomics. So all they will be able to see and all that's in the law is: you buy a token at price X at time t1 and you sell it again for Y at time t2. If (t2-t1>1 year) ignore, otherwise tax Y-X.\n\nAlso worth noting that this does not increase the minimum hodl time to 10 years - rETH does not generate interest, we only assume it will be worth more Euros after a while.\n\nHowever, I am no lawyer, NFI, DYOR, blah blah...",

Rocket Pool works by depositing funds into a smart contract that then launches new contracts for each minipool. The minipool operator only has access to stake, with no access to the underlying funds. When funds are withdrawn from staking they are exited to another smart contract that divides the funds correctly. This feature is called \"Withdraw to smart contract\" and is known as \"0x02\".\n\n> if something bad happens to the RocketPool project, there goes the value of your rETH\n\nIf something happens to the Rocket Pool project, nothing happens to the value of rEth, it's smart contract controlled. Rocket Pool stakers can continue staking long after the project is gone, and the rEth pool will continue to operate. In other words, rEth doesn't depend on Rocket Pool (the company) at all.",

I just [pulled up this link to audit findings] (https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketpool/comments/q0v29a/rocket_pool_audit_reports/) from Consensys, Sigma Prime, and Trail of Bits (for people who are newer to the space, those are the top tier auditors). The code is also completely open source, so an outside researcher can evaluate it on their own. \n\nIn regard to \"staking on L2\", it can be a little complex and I'm 3/4 asleep, but I'll take a whack at it. When you stake with a liquidity token (like rEth), you're not actually staking with that token, you're trading your Eth for an IOU, and your eth is staked by an independent node operator anywhere in the world (someone like me). Your rEth can then be traded back for Eth on the open market and you'll receive the staking rewards in the sell price. (I.e. You buy rEth for 1.0 Ether today and sell it back for 1.05 Ether after a year). The liquidity token, rEth in this case, can easily be cross layered, so you can buy/sell/trade it on Arbitrum as if you were staking Ether on Arbitrum. Throughout the evolution of Ethereum these abstractions are what continue to develop at the speed of light giving new flexibility where it never existed before.",

So, with six months in production without a fault we have some expectation that RP might continue running successfully for a little while longer.",

            "selftext": "Hi, I have some eth on the exchange and I'm thinking to move them to a ledger. I would like to low the gas fee of the mainnet by using Arbitrum, which is supported by my exchange but I've some difficulties to understand how these L2 works.\n\nAccording with this video (see the link at the end of the post) , once I transfer Eth from the exchange to the ledger on arbitrum I get AETH on the ledger (min. 13.17). If I want to transform them back in ETH I need to use this Hop Exchange (min. 16.25) and to do this I've to pay the mainnet gas fee.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. how do I save in gas fee by using this process? It seems to me that I'm going to pay more than transferring directly eth with erc20 because first I have to pay arbitrum fee and then to pay Hop erc20 gas fee (which from the video my understanding is that being an erc20 fee its cost will be the same as transferring eth to the ledger on erc20)\n2. the second option would be to keep ETH in the ledger as AETH but...isn't this a less secure asset than the \"real\" Eth? The difference seems to me like to have real gold or paper gold...is this wrong? What if Arbitrum, which is a quite new thing breaks (from the video my uderstanding is that AETH works only on Arbitrum)? Sorry if my question doesn't make sense but I find really hard to get this thing....\n3. Consider that my scope is to accumulate eth by DCA and eventually get some yield. If I move my eth from the exchange to the ledger I would like to use a service like Lido or Rocketpool to generate some yield...so my last question is: can I use these services with AETH, instead of ETH?\n4. the last question is: if I do some mistake in setting up the exchange and the ledger on \"arbitrum mode\" do I loose my eth in the transferring?\n\nThis is the video I was referencing to: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK-OFuPwes&t=987s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK-OFuPwes&t=987s)\n\nThank you in advance!",

Arbitrum makes transactions like swaps and DeFi stuff about 10x. Therefore if you are going to do loads of shenanigans like perpetuals trading, covering your trades with options, lending and borrowing etc etc then you'll very quickly save back the fees that you spent bridging onto the rollup.\n\nIf on the other hand you just want to buy and hold ether there isn't a direct advantage to moving to Arbitrum. There might be indirect advantages though, as lots of economic activity is going to be moving to L2s as time goes on (http://podcast.banklesshq.com/the-trillion-dollar-l2-opportunity-part-one).\n\nWith regards to RocketPool, while you can't use the dApp on an L2, there is liquidity for rETH on DEXs on Arbitrum so you can just swap whatever you like for it.",

It sounds like your exchange already supports Arbitrum withdrawals, in which case you can pretty much just skip the steps in the video and withdraw directly to your ledger on Arbitrum. It works exactly like withdrawing on mainnet, just ~10x cheaper. \n\n2. Technically yes, Arbitrum is operating in a trusted capacity right now with plans to decentralize in the near-ish future. AETH is essentially just the representation of real ETH held by the Arbitrum contracts; it won't lose its value peg to ETH unless the bridge is exploited. There are additional risks here; don't put your entire portfolio on Arbitrum yet. \n\n3. You can buy rETH on Arbitrum Uniswap, yes. I don't think stETH has been deployed there, yet. \n\n4. It depends on the mistake, but really there isn't much to it. As long as you send it to your address and *only* your address, you'll still be able to access the funds somehow. The only way you could lose them is if you sent them to the wrong address.",
