It went from showing Zero rewards, to showing some rewards which didn't make mathematical sense, and now it is showing 2.60% APY? \n\nI ALREADY know to pull my coins off of exchanges and do my own staking. Majority of my ADA is not on exchanges, but I do keep a small amount on exchanges to play around with. \n\nHas anybody heard anything from Coinbase? I've chatted with them many times at this point and they ignore my questions and keep sending me links to their staking webpage. \n\nIs my math correct on how Coinbase staking works? Let's use 1000 ADA staked for 40 days at 3.75 APY as an example.\n\n1,000 * .0375 = 37.5 yearly rewards\n40 days / 365 days a year = .109\n37.5 * .109 = 4.109 ADA\n\n4.109 ADA Earned in 40 days?",
