            "selftext": "This claim is prefaced by the clause, \"according to investigators and attorneys involved in the case\" which means that the claim could be false since no one authorized to privileged communication has the opacity to speak out about it. Here is the full context:\n\n> In a 2020 Vanity Fair article Nick Bilton wrote that, according to investigators and attorneys involved in the case, Ulbricht had been offered a favorable plea deal which would have likely given him a decade-long sentence, but he turned it down. Bilton wrote, \"(Ulbricht) believed that he was smarter than everyone in the room, and that he could beat them all.\"[53] Assistant US Attorney Timothy Howard, who was co-responsible for prosecuting the case, testified that the only plea offer was made before Ulbricht's indictment and carried a mandatory minimum of 10 years to a maximum of life imprisonment and that the United States sentencing guideline was life imprisonment.[54]\n\nI don't understand the last quoted sentence as it's impossible to sentence someone to a \"range of two values\" (i.e. 10 years to life). The judge has to pick an exact number of years/months, correct?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ulbricht\n\nCreating a website to facilitate the selling of drugs and hiring a fake hitman for murder should not carry a double-life sentence, which is what Ross received. Even if you believe that his punishment is justified, you shouldn't be punished that severely for saying \"no\" to a plea deal and exercising your right to a jury trial in a court of law.",
