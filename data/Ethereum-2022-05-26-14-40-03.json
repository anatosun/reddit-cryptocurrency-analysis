The old hash rate was just a handful of CPU miners. A couple of GPUs was all it took to increase it by a factor of 30.\n\nI called this in a conversation with friends a couple of weeks ago. Miners who want to delay the merge to keep their mining hardware active as long as possible only needed to divert a tiny fraction of their hashing power over to Ropsten to hit the TTD before the beacon chain was ready. If diverting a just couple of GPUs for a couple of days delays the merge for a week, they'll more than recoup the cost of the hashing power later.\n\nI didn't say anything publicly because I want the merge to happen and didn't want to give anyone ideas on how to delay it, but I'm not the least bit surprised that someone else figured it out.",

If Ropsten suffers a significant failure due to the PoS upgrade and the result is that the main net merge gets delayed again that puts more money into the pockets of PoW miners. PoW miners who have plenty of GPUs to devote to boosting Ropsten's hashrate like this.\n\nOver the years I've always argued that PoW miners are incapable of stopping the PoS transition, they have no actual capability to change the outcome or stop users from upgrading. But there are still ways they can *try* to mess with it, so care should be taken not to leave easy exploits like this open for them. Miners are self-interested by design so this is to be expected.",
