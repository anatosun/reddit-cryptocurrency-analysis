            "selftext": "You may call the price movements over the preceding six months anything you choose. Even if we've improved slightly in the last two months, we're still on the decrease. But, in the case of a drop, I believe we all know what to do. Yes, make the purchase. You should try to time your fall such that you are at the bottom and can restock your supplies. Even if we fall lower, everyone who does that is smart, since no one will notice if you bought at 40k or 47k in ten years.  \n\n\nHowever, acquiring knowledge is another thing to do to completely gain from a terrible market. Because there aren't as many hopium-traders during a bad market as there are during a bull market, you can learn the most about the market. Learn how people react to a little pump during certain periods, for example, and how it goes. Instead, do some study to learn about new concepts. Cardano, ROSE, and now High Sloth Society\u00a0were all found this way. Keep an eye on the situation.  \n\n\nI'd even go so far as to argue that if you can't afford the dip due to financial constraints, it's not an issue. Simply by monitoring the bear market, you may profit from it. Experience is the key to success.",

It\u2019s not about timing the bottom. That\u2019s straight up gambling! Trying to time the bottom will get you REKT. What you should be doing is learning basic TA so you have a rough idea where a correction is likely to end up. You then place a number of buy orders around different support levels. Some will take and some won\u2019t. This is not timing the bottom! If you don\u2019t know how to do TA and can\u2019t be bothered to learn, then you simply average down if you are liquid enough. You are mixing trading and investing together. They are not the same and they require different strategies. Mixing these and not defining what each is will get you REKT. Pick a strategy and stick to it! Don\u2019t deviate from it! Don\u2019t let emotions dictate your decisions away from your strategy.",

This is a great post.\n\nPeople on reddit hate TA for whatever reason (probably they don't understand it)\n\nEveryone here just screams \"HODL\" which is the dumbest narrative and outrageously stupid. These assets that have 50% drawdowns every year.\n\nMy guess is that we are going to hit the 200 week sma for bitcoin. Its going to get very ugly if the fed doesn't prop the market soon. I am not even prepared to accumulate because the charts look like they will go much lower. Especially alts. Don't try to catch the falling the knife.",
