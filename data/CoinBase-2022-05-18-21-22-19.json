It delays it three days If I chose to ignore it, though I can speed it up if I confirm my ID through the email that is sent. \n\nI should note that I changed from 2FA via SMS to an authenticator key yesterday, and ever since, its been delaying every time I send. \n\nHas this happened to anyone? What should I do to fix this?",
