            "selftext": "Hey  Guys so I bought Dogecoin at 55 cents back last April. The next couple  months I did hold on to see if it would go back up but it didn't really.  Around September that year I decided to sell my dogecoin at around 26  cents. Which means I lost half of my investment. -50%. I reinvested in a  stock called Kenon and from Sept-December made money, whereas if I held  on to dogecoin as was the consensus in this forum I would have just  bled out more money, around 88% of my money to be exact.\n\nI  ask you all at this point. Why hold dogecoin? Is it a pride thing? Why  do you think dogecoin would go back up above 30 cents if the last time  everyone invested in hopes that it would go to a dollar, they got burned  badly? It had all the hype and most people who were going to buy  dogecoin did, and they lost money. So the next time the hype comes  around you're not going to have nearly as many buyers forcing the price  up. Why hold at this point, just curious.  \nBecause when I reflect on the whole thing I truly believe that selling my dogecoin was the best financial decision I've ever made. Honest to god.   \n",

The market as a whole is dropping and I\u2019ve seen a lot about crashing and recession but I do believe down there road they\u2019ll be money to be made for those who hold and lower their average. But to answer your question- I have faith in the coin and the community.",

Plus with Elon potentially buying twitter, I could see doge being boosted through twitter. Honestly doesnt seem likely, but like I said I bought doge to either hit a home run or strike out. I would've bought an index fund if I wanted a small gain",

Ignoring that fact only means that you have no idea about what trading is and that you should have never invested a single cent into anything.",
