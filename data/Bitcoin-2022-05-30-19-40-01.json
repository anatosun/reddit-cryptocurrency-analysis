Eg a country may choose to recreate their currency with a peg to say USD.\n\nThe idea is piggybacking on something that retains perceived value by others. Cryptocurrency like bitcoin have global value, so yes, its almost inevitable countries will need to include some in their central bank reserves because its easier and safer to store and transfer than physical representative value like gold.\n\nNations are likely going to do this slowly and quietly because they get better value than announcing it.\n\nPeople who say gold is the way forward in hard times remind me of those people who said the internet is great but it cant replace high street banks because we need to get our bank notes out at some point :)",

They're not interested in stabilizing their currencies.  \n\nThey once *claimed* to back their currencies with gold, but they were lying and printing more notes than they had gold to cover.  They'd do the exact same with Bitcoin.  There is no reason to trust any central banker, in fact, there are plenty of valid reasons to NOT trust them, ever, for anything.",
