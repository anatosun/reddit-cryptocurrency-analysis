Nokia never had popular top of the line phones.\n\nFrom what I remember, when flip phones became popular and catered to the higher end market, nokia was never that popular.\n\nThey just managed to sell a shit ton of the 3310s or whatever.\n\nKids that had more money often rocked pricier phone models. Like Sony Ericsson or Sharp phones etc.\n\nSo really it's no surprise that Nokia missed out on the smartphone era. They were never really on the forefront of their industry, technology-wise anyway.\n\nWhereas today, iPhone and Samsung and whatever else, is expected to have the best performance on their newly released phones with top of the line price tag. It was never a game that Nokia was good at imo. At least that's what I remember anyway.\n\nThey were happy to keep selling relatively cheap 3310s and dominating that market. Like how Toyota sells a shit ton of corollas.",

The entire market lies along a continuum, from the truly scarce, original and valuable stuff at one end, to the over-produced commodity stuff at the low end. For example: \n\nA Babe Ruth rookie card is truly rare and valuable, and will always be worth millions, no matter what the baseball card market does (or even what the economy does).\n\nOn the other hand, overproduced baseball cards from recent years are no different than Fed money printing: common, a purposeful and continuous dilution of value, and no restrictions on supply.\n\nBitcoins = \"The Babe Ruth rookie cards\" of the crypto market.",
