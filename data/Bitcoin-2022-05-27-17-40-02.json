One of the basic functions of money is to be a store of value over time. If it fails at it, it fails as money. Therefore, the euro is failing.\n\nYou are right that the euro is backed by all the people who use it - until there's meddling with it. Lagarde meddled with it; it's no longer backed by the strength of the EU economy, it's backed by hope that she hasn't meddled with it to the degree that it will kill it.

Taxation, foreign trade, forcing currency upon other economies (petrodollar), are used to increase demand of fiat. Even the assets used as collateral (treasuries) are indirect fiat.\n\nThe only way to increase the value of your imaginary fiat asset, is to force more demand of the asset onto people. This is why the US government would rather the poor in USA suffer than accept Russian loan repayment in anything other than USD.\n\nCentralizing the currency is essentially a takeover of the economy, where you make interest off the GDP of said economy.",
