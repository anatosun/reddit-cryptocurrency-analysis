            "selftext": "**WORLD PREMIERE: Crypto Runner**\n\nCrypto Runner brings forward a unique and creative trading artificial intelligence solution that is the first of its kind in the cryptocurrency field. This solution is supported by an algorithm that does frontrunning, or getting ahead of previous transactions that are still in the MEM pool, by adjusting GAS costs to purchase at a discount and then sell at a premium after the initially intended transaction. In addition, Crypto Runner is available on both the BSC Smart Chain and the Ethereum network.\n\n**Uncovering the Potential of Crypto Runner**\n\nSo far, Crypto Runner has proved itself to be a prolific initiative. Since mid-2021, the Crypto Runner team has been building and testing its code and Tech Stack. The algorithm was soft launched in early October 2021 and has experienced an average monthly rise of 15.4 %, or around 2-4 % weekly. This code works for its users 24 hours a day, anticipating and capitalising on global possibilities.\n\n**Mechanisms of Crypto Runner**\n\nCrypto Runner is sustained by bots, which are pre-programmed programs that enable you to fully automate your trading. Overall, the program is based on a newly created front-running algorithm. A front-running bot scans pending transactions and pays a higher gas charge for miners to execute its transaction first, thereby front-running a substantial deal that would impact market pricing.\n\nRather than monitoring every market move and waiting for the optimal moment to purchase and sell, the bot will analyse market data and execute asset transactions on your behalf.\n\nCrypto Runner remains on the cutting edge of the crypto field due to their ongoing collaboration with developers with over 20 years of expertise, marketing gurus, and devoted staff.\n\n**Access Crypto Runner**\n\nTheir business model offers different plans. You can choose between the Premium and the Basic package. A trial version is also available for interested parties, which includes a 7-day trial.\n\n**Useful Information:**\n\nAre you willing to embark on this unique blockchain journey and acquire unprecedented profits?

And i watched the training vid etc but i still dont understand what marks the winner, WHEN either of the final limits is not met. For example i go short position so if the BTC reaches 37000$ i win, if it reaches 37200$ my opponent wins. I get that, but how is the winner/loser determined when either of these is not met within 5 minutes? Logically i would say the one whos closer to the short or long price so in this case middle ground is 37100$ so 37101$ and more - long wins, 37099$ and less - short wins. But it seems totally random so far...",
