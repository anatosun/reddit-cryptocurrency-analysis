However my friends just got verified with Amazon orders and Phone Bills. I have sen't them my bank statements ( all kinds of ) and even the phone/amazon bills. No, not a chance. I can't send them anything else because none of our regular bills (internet, rent) are on my name. I tried to find someone real to contact but found noone. Can anybody help me please?",
