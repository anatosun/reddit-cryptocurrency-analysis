It\u2019s a process.  \n\nI like him on an intrinsic level, even though I\u2019m considered far left of center.  I don\u2019t define myself by politics.\n\nHe identifies himself by what he does, not who he is\u2026 that\u2019s okay.  But that perspective shapes a lot on his worth ethic and how he views the world.  Plenty of people like him\u2026.  We need them.",
