            "selftext": "Chances are there since De-Fi has enough potential to fill the shoes of the traditional financial system.   According to Coin Telegraph. A legal note is signed between Binance's CEO and the President of Kazakhstan. The plans are regarding developing regulations and policies for crypto assets in the country.     \nDe-Fi space is booming across the world; Kazakhstan might don't want to stay behind in this race.   Kazakhstan is among the major hubs of Cryptocurrency and the De-Fi community. Even a big chunk of Binance's community is from the country.      \nWhen coming to its adaption to the economy, Kazakhstan might not take such a big step after looking at El Salvador's economic conditions, which are pretty terrible.       \nHowever, as De-Fi development is rapid, Kazakhstan and other countries might regulate cryptocurrencies in various sectors.     \nBanking, telecom, advertising, and fintech are some areas where cryptocurrencies can grow drastically at any time. Utility based projects like Solana that has lot of utility based dapps built on that, BAT that comes in play with brave browser reward system, TokLok which allow holders to enjoy the platform's paid messaging app services for free alongside winning locking rewards and Cardano well-known for its Ouroboros protocol can be top players. What are your views though?",
