Right now, the only way to verify that a block is valid is by running the transactions in it and check everything yourself. But you also have to check that the block before that was valid... So this goes all the way back to the very first genesis block which is always treated as valid.\n\nIf you zk everything, you get to create blocks that contain a proof that all the transactions in it are valid and their results affected the blockchain's state properly, as well as a proof that the previous block was valid as well. It's gonna be proofs within proofs within proofs, and the result is a light client doesn't have to store any data to nearly-instantly check for itself that the block that just got proposed is 100% valid.\n\nBut that's a \"nice to have\" on the roadmap, on the long long term. In reality this recursive zk stuff is still being researched and is gonna roll out on various Layer 2s way before Layer 1 gets close to getting zkified",
