In general btc, eth, ada, near, solana, doge, etcetc are cheap now to buy some. But there are hard times in the world. Global scale problems, so remember it can go lower . That is why it is beter to invest now 100 dollar and see for two weeks later and then also invest 100 dollar (for example). What i learned in those years , when the fear index is sky rocket high, then it is buy time.",
