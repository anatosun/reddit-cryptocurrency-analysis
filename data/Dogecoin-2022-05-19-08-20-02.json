It is common for btc to retrace 80%+ during a bear market.\n\nDoge at 90% off ath is .05.\n\nIf bitcoin continues decline, we can see .05 Doge or lower.\n\nBut it will continue to rise eventually... Think long term, 10 yrs plus, and all will be well.",

And in the 2018-2020 bear(droped less than the 2015 bear ), more money were into crypto compated to the 2015 bear. \n\nThis means that we are already at the bottom or very close to it , unless Tether collapses. If it does, BTC could go under 10k and doge well under 1\uffe0.",
