Not to do that again and again all you need to do is buy when every one already exited but have not started getting back in, which is in next few weeks and months. I have a monster buy order for Doge once it hits 4c and 2c. That is 97% discount from its ATH in 2021. To me that is an amazing buying entry point instead of the usual massive price that sparks every retail investors interest.\n\nThink about it this way. On the way up when you bought at 30c, 40c, 50c or even 60c, did you not hoped you could have more DOGE coins. Did you not liked it at those prices back when. Well now you have a chance to buy double, triple or 5x the amount of DOGE coins you have now for a tiny fraction of what you paid before. Its a no brainer for me, but not yet. Waiting for even better entry point in a near future.\n\nI have few coins I like a lot that have been around since 2017. I have even lower price purchase orders for all of them at 40% down from this point and another 50% down for my very last order that might not fill but you never know. DOGE is one of them and I will buy and sell DOGE all day long. Its the best known meme coin on the planet. Nothing even compares. I love it when they put down coins like DOGE or Cardano as not real or worthless because it scares people away and gives investors like me amazing discounts. The truth is that none of these coins have worth in projects, users or adoption today. They just dont. Everything is based on confidence, hopes, hype and believe that future will bring something better. In that environment its not about adoption but about hype and which coin has proven over and over over again, that hype rewards with profits. DOGE! The same people that bad mouth it today will get in out of FOMO later or keep complaining that it does not deserve the price pumps in the future. Regardless it will be their loss. \n\nSaying all that, crypto is nothing but gambling for every coin, since the values we see during any bull market is based on nothing but speculation so invest what you can part with, set your goals of profits and get out when you made good money.",
