It gave confidence to new businesses coming into the country knowing their purchasing power won't turn to shit overnight.\n\nIf you have a sound money system based on math (e.g Bitcoin, Monero etc), something that has a stable low inflation rate which nobody can manipulate then you no longer need Gold to back a currency.\n\nWith Gold, you need to trust the third party not to screw you over.\n\nYou didn't have evolving technology in the past that could replace Gold but you do now with solid Crypto Currencies projects.",
