In other words, if you\u2019re ok with bitcoin being a cat sitting on a table and doing nothing, then sure, regulatory hostility doesn\u2019t matter. And even then it still implicitly acknowledges that regulatory hostility is relevant to network development.\n\nRegulatory hostility will not help bitcoin adoption or the continued development of the network. No, it won\u2019t put an end to bitcoin, but it would be a clear net-negative. If the network doesn\u2019t or cannot continue expanding then it\u2019s power to drive change is significantly reduced. \n\nPoint being, hostile regulation is objectively relevant to bitcoin\u2019s growth and there\u2019s no defensible argument against that.",
