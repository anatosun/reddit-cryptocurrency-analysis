Last week i commented my concern about how if a state lacks control over it's currency, then the financial system and the society would might become very unstable. My query is almost anti crypto or anti-bitcoin.\n\nBut i didn't receive any name callings or sarcastic remarks. Instead people in the thread actually discussed over the topic. That's a great tradition for any group or culture to succeed. That there are no ultimatums but only logics",

It\u2019s good you had kind and helpful responses!\n\nI think you have a good question for discussion.\n\nTo your point about states losing control of currency, you\u2019re absolutely right. This happens because fiat is too inflationary and ultimately results in hyperinflation and if it doesn\u2019t get fixed- Revolution, and potentially collapse of society.\n\nThis happens with or without crypto or Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is an exit from this cycle of fiat and hyperinflation, which is all too common if you look around the world today, and at history. \n\n- A finite supply (21M Bitcoins, with 100m satoshis per Bitcoin, think of satoshis or sats as cents)\n- transparent (public immutable ledger, \u201ctime chain\u201d) \n\nIf implemented, this combination makes it difficult if not impossible for a state to corrupt the money supply. \n\nHal Finney, an early collaborator and adopter of Bitcoin hypothesized a future where some banks use Bitcoin as a base layer for financial activity. Some banks would be more or less conservative than others. Some could still practice fractional reserve baking, others would use a Bitcoin standard only. People would be free to choose where they bank.\n\nI\u2019d say he is right and it\u2019s happening during our lifetimes as many banks have begun to offer Bitcoin services and some countries have established Bitcoin as currency.\n\nNot long from now I believe more banks and countries will adopt Bitcoin in ways Hal believes would happen.",

I'm no expert and I've started learning only recently but even I feel like we need an independent currency for world trade rather than Dollar or Pound or Yen or whatever. It should be something that no state has a control of. And Bitcoin feels lke the best fit for it.\n\nIt's like the initial years when internet was first invented. Some tech people used to use it for sending info while the world was unaware. Then some people released music or novels or games or something on internet while the rest called it a fad. And finally it became the backbone of a functional society.\n\nCrypto currency is still in the initial days and one day it might be the backbone of economy. And Bitcoin has the major part to play in this story",
