You have to look and see what kind of project they are doing and most of them are doing absolutely nothing they are just ways for the owners the creators to make money.\n\nWhen you buy a  share you are buying a piece of a company and the company makes money by selling products and services with cryptos the owners the creators do not really make money they only really make money when there coin goes up hence the reason for mass pump and dump coins and shitcoins. Safe moon was shitcoin but crazy FOMO was built around it and people bought the coin \n\nEven binance lost lots of money on terra Luna, you would have thought a company that profits of traders would understand how crypto currencies work even they got it wrong and lost money",
