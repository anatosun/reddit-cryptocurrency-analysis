Why, so they can short Doge and drive the price down, of course.\n\nSo it\u2019s a lose/lose proposition. A trap for the greedy.\n\nKeep your coins offline in wallets you actually have exclusive control of. Just search for \u2018text wallet\u2019 and have a read.",

They make more money from your coins than you do while you carry all the risk.\n\nOn top of that, your coins are being used to short the price of doge and reduce the value of your investment.\n\nIf you want passive income get a real proof-of-stake coin and stake it. You can do that from your cold-wallet and there is no risk of loss and no risk of harming your own investment. \n\nLending them out is just you shooting your own foot.",
