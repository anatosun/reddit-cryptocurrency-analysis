Plus I think Dimon finally ate shit and said he was wrong.\n\nBut I don't think it only applies to shillers who live in NY (though that's not small). It matters because YouTube loads in NY, which means people in NY can go after YouTubers and other media shillers if they don't disclose. When things happen in tiny jurisdictions, sometimes people will try to do end-runs or demonetize themselves just there, but you don't really want to demonetize a state of 20 million people.",
