It's a bit more convenient, cause you don't have to think about it when going to the shop again, you never can forget it at home and you don't need to carry the extra weight on your way.  \n\nBut is the convenience really worth it? What if the store gets robbed? Your money will be gone. What if new regulations require the cashier to ask for an ID every time you want to get some money out of your wallet? What is the cashier suspects you of some fraud? What if they simply feel like stealing your money? Are you ok with those risks for the tiny bit of increased convenience?  \n\nWell, the honest answer is: it's up to you. It's your money after all.

Daily got the lowest gains.\n\nBasically, what it confirmed to me was the more you buy, sooner. The higher your gains later.\n\nBuying frequently in smaller amounts has you riding the volatility line very closely.  Buying less frequently in larger amounts allows you to have less stress, and obtain better gains, acting as a bit of a buffer from the daily volatility.\n\nI personally DCA 12% of my paycheck each month.",
