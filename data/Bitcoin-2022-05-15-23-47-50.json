It's like having an actual gold coin in your own vault at home versus having a paper note that has \"gold\" written on it at someone else's place. You don't even know if you actually have any coin if you never take possession of it.",

Then reassemble. \n\nThe tanks are assembled by our facilities/construction team. Which we wire with Ethernet and C20-C13 splitter power cables. Then add 33 miners to each tank, fill it up with dielectric oil and flip it on. Then we IP each miner in order so that we can find them when they have problems (spoiler alert they pretty much don\u2019t have problems when immersed) and then we send our tech-wiz guy (not sure what his job title is) the serial number of each miner and he registers them with foundry and boom we\u2019re hashing. \n\nRinse and repeat. It\u2019s so easy a cave man could do it.\n\nEdit: also I worked with air cooled miners during training and that\u2019s pretty much the same thing only fans die all the time and we have to go out and replace them.",

It's a bit more convenient, cause you don't have to think about it when going to the shop again, you never can forget it at home and you don't need to carry the extra weight on your way.  \n\nBut is the convenience really worth it? What if the store gets robbed? Your money will be gone. What if new regulations require the cashier to ask for an ID every time you want to get some money out of your wallet? What is the cashier suspects you of some fraud? What if they simply feel like stealing your money? Are you ok with those risks for the tiny bit of increased convenience?  \n\nWell, the honest answer is: it's up to you. It's your money after all.
