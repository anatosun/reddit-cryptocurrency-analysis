It's a bit more convenient, cause you don't have to think about it when going to the shop again, you never can forget it at home and you don't need to carry the extra weight on your way.  \n\nBut is the convenience really worth it? What if the store gets robbed? Your money will be gone. What if new regulations require the cashier to ask for an ID every time you want to get some money out of your wallet? What is the cashier suspects you of some fraud? What if they simply feel like stealing your money? Are you ok with those risks for the tiny bit of increased convenience?  \n\nWell, the honest answer is: it's up to you. It's your money after all. But there are also [some more arguments](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/ghd9fu/downsides_of_keeping_bitcoin_on_trading_app/fq87ri9/) why you should not store your coins on an exchange.   \n\nYou can choose a wallet here:  https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html  \n\nor here:  https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet  \n\nStorage best practices: https://bitcoin-intro.com/en/backup",

It's like having an actual gold coin in your own vault at home versus having a paper note that has \"gold\" written on it at someone else's place. You don't even know if you actually have any coin if you never take possession of it.",

The total invested would be the same for each.\n\nI found that monthly was the greatest gains by about 10% higher than weekly.  Daily got the lowest gains.\n\nBasically, what it confirmed to me was the more you buy, sooner. The higher your gains later.\n\nBuying frequently in smaller amounts has you riding the volatility line very closely.  Buying less frequently in larger amounts allows you to have less stress, and obtain better gains, acting as a bit of a buffer from the daily volatility.\n\nI personally DCA 12% of my paycheck each month.",
