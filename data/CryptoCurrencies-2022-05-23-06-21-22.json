Not entirely...\n\nBut people are losing their life savings and this asshole is posting a burn address with a three word tagline of \"there u go\" and then has to post another clarification post to tell people not to send their already useless tokens to the burn address because I'm sure people started burning in desperation and he got even MORE people saying they lost their life savings because of him.\n\nIs there shared responsibility? Yea, but the least the guy could do is not act like a shitty teenager who forgot to walk the dog and then tries to act like the dog shitting on the floor wasn't his fault.",
