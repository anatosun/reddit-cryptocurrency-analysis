            "selftext": "Disclaimer: I\u2019m a total crypto rookie. \n\nI staked .17 ETH on Coinbase one year ago. I have read the user agreement pertaining to staked ETH, I understand I \u201cpledged\u201d it to them. They will not allow me to withdraw it bc it\u2019s locked until 1.5 rolls out. My issue is, when my connected fiat account didn\u2019t have any more funds, they pull out the owed balance from those \u201clocked\u201d funds. I cannot unlock and withdraw them though. It\u2019s a losing battle I guess, but it is not right. Any suggestions for me? \n\nAlso, I was contacted by two different law firms about class action suits against them. I did not sign, but I was told I was probably eligible? \n\nI\u2019m looking for any information anyone has about the staked ETH thing and what these class action suits were about? \n\nI\u2019m probably out of luck, but I figured I would post and see what everyone has to say. Most likely it will be something like, \u201csucks dude\u201d but idk worth a shot to learn more I guess? Thanks in advance.",

If I purchase crypto on CB, Fiat account overdrafts and they don\u2019t get their money, they\u2019ll create a pointer or IOU essentially from me to them with my \u201clocked\u201d funds. \n\nMy next thought concerns timing of this bc if they pull it a week later after not receiving, then the amount could be different since ETH fluctuates. Normal banks don\u2019t take inflation into account in these scenarios either; so, I doubt I have a case lol. It\u2019s interesting though. Oh welllllllll I\u2019ll just wait. \n\nSo used to seeing fancy big corporation have me sign something I just didn\u2019t read it but when it comes to crypto\u2026\u2026\u2026.. even if it\u2019s the biggest name in the game\u2026\u2026.
