I think they are all working on bringing it back, this time in compliance with regulations but who knows how long that will take.\n\nMy suggestion would be to spread the risk around. Don't concentrate. And don't go after the highest rates. They are not sustainable. If someone is significantly above the others, ask yourself why. Luckily that falls in line with what they are offering: high teaser rates for just a small slice of a BTC. So take advantage of that slice everywhere you can.\n\nBut some you can try: Ledn, Coinloan, Celsius, Nexo, BlockFi, Voyager, Gemini.  Hodlnaut might be an option as well depending on where you are. I maintain a list for myself showing who gives what interest. If there is enough interest (NPI), I can share it. But the current cult consensus seems to be that you shouldn't try to earn interest on your BTC. Shrug....",
