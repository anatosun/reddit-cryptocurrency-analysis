There are some protocols like Ocean right now that basically offer users to take full control of their private info and monetize it in any shape or form they wish to. And while this is still used for scientific issues and statistics, I\u2019m pretty sure that they can expand on this a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully we start seeing more and more similar projects pop up in order to fight the menace that is Meta.",
