There were options before and now there are more options than even, from Ocean to Brave in terms of monetising our data, but NFTs can be ours, don't need to go public or anything with them... just keep them on your wallet and one's free to have them on Ethereum, Solana, Unique Network, Wax Labs, BSC... anything really!",
