Although I am still learning about stuffs hence I\u2019m new to it. I will be using binance, do you guys have any advice? Or maybe where should I put my money and focus on? I don\u2019t have a huge cash in me yet but I\u2019m willing to make it grow. I\u2019m from the Philippines, if that would help. I would really really appreciate your thoughts and advise! Thank you! I would also be glad to know your experiences with shitcoin!!",

But in the case that you\u2019re real then here are some tips for you that you should really take serious. 1) Don\u2019t invest more than you can afford to lose. 2) Don\u2019t buy shitcoins. Yes there are people that invest early in some random shitcoins and become rich. But those people are the minority, there are more people that lose lots of money by investing into shitcoins than there are people that get rich by it. So you\u2019re way more likely to lose your money than to get rich. There are literally hundreds of new shitcoins created everyday, and most of them fail. 3) Before investing into crypto, educate yourself. Learn how crypto works, what crypto is for and how to spot scams. 4) Don\u2019t get scammed, as a beginner you\u2019re more likely to get scammed. There are many scams in the world of crypto. You need to learn how to not get scammed. 5) don\u2019t believe what YouTubers say / don\u2019t watch crypto YouTubers (especially not BitBoy) 6) Invest in bitcoin and ethereum",
