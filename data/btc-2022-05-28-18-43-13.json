Additionally, an update to the internal compiler tools used to build the Windows version should improve performance and stability for Windows users.  ***It is strongly recommended*** that Windows users update to this version at their earliest convenience.  Also in this release: a fix-up for dark mode on Linux & Windows.\n\n# What's New in 4.2.10\n\n- Windows build: Restored reproducibility of the Windows build #2444 (Axel Gembe)\n- Removal of dead code (cculianu)\n- Fixup for dark mode on some Linux and Windows systems (Pierre K)\n\n---\n\n## Download Notes\n\n- **`.AppImage`** is for any **Linux 64 bit** (it's a self-contained app bundle with everything inside) \n  - **Note**: Be sure to set this to executable to run it (`chmod +x`)\n- **`.dmg`** is for **macOS** (Mojave or above is required otherwise it may not run)\n- **`.exe`** is for **Windows**\n- **Srcdist** is provided as **`.tar.gz`** and/or **`.zip`** files \n  - Includes Python dependencies inside in `packages/`\n  - This is built on a **Linux 64-bit** system, and also includes `libsecp256k1.so.0` and the embedded `tor` static binary.\n- **ShaSums and Signatures:** Sha256 hashes and pgp signatures for the below release [are available here](https://github.com/Electron-Cash/keys-n-hashes/tree/master/sigs-and-sums).",
