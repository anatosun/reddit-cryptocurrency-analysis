The reporter, who appeared to me to be arrogant, was almost stuttering when asking him again what he was saying. I remember getting impressed when I was watching it. I'm sure a lot of new people got interested in Bitcoin because of those.\n\nBtw just ignore the low numbers predictions/suggestion, he's probably just wanting to buy. Everyone should thank him, cuz if he succeeds this means we also can buy at a lower price for a while.",
