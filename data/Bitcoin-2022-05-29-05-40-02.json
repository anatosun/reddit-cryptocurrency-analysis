            "selftext": "Guys Ive read all the introductory posts, but still cant wrap my head around it. Here is me rambling off in my head trying to piece it together:\n\nWe basically use an exchange to buy / sell bitcoin. A key is needed to buy / sell bitcoin. So when you buy on an exchange, they have your password, right? Because otherwise you couldnt make transactions on those exhanges? So who is to say that one day these exchanges who hold so many peoples money, told everyone to screw off and told people \"we don't have your money\" and just kept it for themselves?\n\nNow another point of confusion I have is regarding \"moving\" your bitcoin out of the exchange. So first we buy it into  the exchange, and then we ask the exchange to give it to us? Ok but where are you moving it to? As far as I know, a cold wallet holds your \"keys\" not your bitcoins. \n\nSecond of all, how does an exchange interact with your \"own storage\", if we are \"moving\" our bitcoin?\n\nEdit: why are people downvoting my comments? Why are you guys so butthurt that this stuff doesn't make sense. Who actually downvotes this stuff? Only folks who are threatened or offended. Otherwise you wouldn't care to put in the effort to downvote, lol. You guys prolly just convinced yourself it all makes sense. You opened a coinbase account like you were told, \"bought\" bitcoins, then bought a device, created some passwords, and that's as far as you know. Anyone can do that. But do you really understand all of this stuff? SMH",

Wallets are just the user interface to addresses/keys. Make sense?",

In everyday usage, \"wallet\" means something that holds your money. In the bitcoin world, a wallet holds the keys to your bitcoin (money). What kind of mental gymnastics is this? Whose idea was this terminology. I see no sense in calling something that holds your keys, a wallet. Why not call it a lockbox?",

You can look up the amount of bitcoin in any wallet publicly.\n\nTo address your other questions, you don't need to use an exchange to use bitcoin. You can buy and sell bitcoin peer-to-peer. You create your own wallet, and only you have the keys *to* your wallet. We meet in a coffee shop, give me $100 and I sell you $100 of bitcoin. Or, you could scan the QR code for your wallet at a bitcoin atm and buy crypto using cash that way. (terrible fees and pricing at the atm btw, but it's an option that exists.)\n\nAs a practical matter exchanges are useful and offer the best fees and pricing. If you leave money on an exchange, it's not exactly \"your\" wallet, it' *their* wallet that they give you access to. If you want to move bitcoin from an exchange to another wallet that you 100% control, just send the bitcoin from the exchange to the bitcoin address of your private wallet.",

The bitcoin standard is not a good book from an academic standpoint. It only has a handful of references for each chapter and they seem to reference other bitcoiners a lot. Also, it relies on Austrian economics which is promising but underdeveloped as hell. Also, check out the author. He is not an acclaimed economist at all (but certainly a smart person) and if you look at his website, you can see he is reeeaaally cashing in on the success of the book. Like offering courses and audiobooks and all sorts of bullshit for money. And of course he wrote another book, the \u201cfiat standard\u201d. Like what is even that, I thought the Bitcoin standard would be THE book. So there\u2019s another one? Why? Well, because there was a lot of money in a sequel, like the Marvel universe. Also his website looks like one of those old eBook places where you pay 10 dollars for \u201c3 secrets that will make you rich\u201d. Not credible at all.\n\nAs per this sub, I have respect for a lot of the members but in my opinion when you ask a question, the answers you get (even from veterans) just lead to more questions. You are welcome to look through my posts and comments in this sub to see my journey of trying to get to the bottom of the case for bitcoin, only to get answers that are based on half baked economic theories and conspiracies.",

They are extremely unlikely to have a wallet dedicated to yourself, and far more likely to have a pot of Bitcoin reserves for the usage of dealing with aforementioned transfers.\n\nWhat's to stop them keeping your money (and you need to distinguish whether you're talking about cash or bitcoin)? Well, that's the big debate going on and why governments are calling for regulations. By the way, most exchanges are not insured by the FDIC: if the exchange rugpulls you then that's a problem... for you.\n\nBut big exchanges however are trying to get mainstream adoption and are too big to attempt criminal activity without the CEO being too well known. Regulation would probably lead to auditing of their reserves eventually.\n\nBut the recommendation anyway is to not keep your Bitcoin on the exchange - buy it and immediately transfer it. The cold wallet holds your allocation to Bitcoin on the blockchain, and so for it to show up on your wallet means it's no longer with the exchange. \n\nAnd of course, you can always personally verify this via looking at the transaction on the blockchain. This is referring to the transaction between your cold wallet and the exchange.",

When you transfer it off exchange to for example, a hardware wallet, then the actual coins are sent out. Since exchanges control the assets and just hand out IOUs they technically could run off but that would be a legal nightmare for them. That is not to say that smaller less reputable exchanges haven't ran off with everyone's money before.\n\nTo the other question about where it's moving to when transferred out. It is transferred to whatever address is associated with the hardware wallet on the Blockchain. You're right that the hardware wallet has the keys. Essentially like the key to your house, which allows you to access the funds at the associated address.",

Because otherwise you couldnt make transactions on those exhanges? So who is to say that one day these exchanges who hold so many peoples money, told everyone to screw off and told people \"we don't have your money\" and just kept it for themselves?\n\nYes. The exchange controls the coins, and you're trusting them. \n\n> Now another point of confusion I have is regarding \"moving\" your bitcoin out of the exchange. So first we buy it into  the exchange, and then we ask the exchange to give it to us? Ok but where are you moving it to? As far as I know, a cold wallet holds your \"keys\" not your bitcoins.\n\nBitcoins are just lockboxes in a file. The exchange controls a bunch of these lockboxes. When they \"give it to you\", they're creating a new lockbox that is locked to your key. A wallet manages these keys for you. \n\n> Second of all, how does an exchange interact with your \"own storage\", if we are \"moving\" our bitcoin?\n\nBitcoins \"move\" within the blockchain, and they move from one lockbox to another. The exchange creates a transaction and it gets written to the blockchain, and thats how coins \"move\". Every exchange and wallet is working from the blockchain.",

The exchange holds access codes that determine what bricks they can buy and sell, and those codes are unique to a set position on the house. The exchange is merely a way to sell fiat for and buy BTC.\n\nWhen you buy a brick from the exchange, your \"wallet\" generates a key that is unique to you, and that then logs the brick on the house that you now own. But neither the brick, nor the house has moved. It just registers that your key corresponds to the coded brick on that house, and you can only transfer ownership to someone else using your keys, \"held\" by your \"wallet\".\n\nIt might not be the perfect analogy, but it might just help highlight that in reality, nothing moves, and nothing is stored in the wallet.\n\nI am new to this, and anyone feel free to correct me!",

What is the association of a \"password I hold\" with funds in a blockchain. And who is overseeing the assignment of these passwords to these bitcoins? Nobody? How? How can I just have a password and that suddenly means that my password is associated to some bitcoins? Who oversees this system? Who ensures that no two people have the same password?",
