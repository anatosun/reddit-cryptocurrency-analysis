Not exactly great hush money.\n\nWhat I do know is that individual people usually aren't 100% wrong/evil, or 100% right/moral, and people who think that way are rarely representing reality objectively. There's no need to see elon as either a villain or a hero. You can judge people action by action, idea by idea.\n\nAnd certainly some of elon's actions are noble in my view. Like trying to get humanity interplanetary or protect free speech. And it appears, he is also not without some faults. But then I don't think anyone should be surprised about people having faults. I know I do. I bet you have faults too. Probably more than you'll admit.",
