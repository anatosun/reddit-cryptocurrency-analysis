Even if there was a price crash, what guarantee would there be that it crashes *lower* than when you originally intended to buy.\n\nSay you decide not to buy Bitcoin now at $30k, and the price goes up to $500k per coin and then, due to a USD collapse, Bitcoin collapses to $100k and stabilises, or even rebounds. Well your prediction would be correct, but you'd have to buy Bitcoin at 3x the price you could have bought it at.",

So the conclusion of this article leaves more questions than answers. I still don't know exactly what number he thinks is correct and how much the intrinsic value of insurance can grow in the future.  \n\n\nI made a small list of other things that could give intrinsic value to Bitcoin:  \n\\- Fiat sovereign Debt Insurance (Atleast $150,000 for just USA, not including every other FIAT)\n\n\\- Cost of Miner Equipment (Security Value) (Calculate by (Total Hash Rate \\* Cost p/Hash))\n\n\\- Cost of Electricity (Energy Value) ([https://medium.com/capriole/bitcoin-value-energy-equivalence-6d00d1baa34a](https://medium.com/capriole/bitcoin-value-energy-equivalence-6d00d1baa34a)) (Roughly $25,000)\n\n\\- Scarcity: Fixed Supply, Measures in place to keep that scarcity (What is the value of Scarcity?). We have never had something scarce before except energy itself \n\n\\- Utility: Global Money, Lightning Network, Self custody, Immutable Ledger, Decentralized, P2P, Secure (Value of utility? Compare if Bitcoin was a company how much would it be worth?)\n\n\\- Uncorrelated Asset (Value of a flight to safety)\n\n\\- Network Effect (Value if there are 100M/1B/10B etc Users)  \n\n\nI think all this is very calculatable although some is arbitrary.
