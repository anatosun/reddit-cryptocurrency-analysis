So the conclusion of this article leaves more questions than answers. I still don't know exactly what number he thinks is correct and how much the intrinsic value of insurance can grow in the future.  \n\n\nI made a small list of other things that could give intrinsic value to Bitcoin:  \n\\- Fiat sovereign Debt Insurance (Atleast $150,000 for just USA, not including every other FIAT)\n\n\\- Cost of Miner Equipment (Security Value) (Calculate by (Total Hash Rate \\* Cost p/Hash))\n\n\\- Cost of Electricity (Energy Value) ([https://medium.com/capriole/bitcoin-value-energy-equivalence-6d00d1baa34a](https://medium.com/capriole/bitcoin-value-energy-equivalence-6d00d1baa34a)) (Roughly $25,000)\n\n\\- Scarcity: Fixed Supply, Measures in place to keep that scarcity (What is the value of Scarcity?). We have never had something scarce before except energy itself \n\n\\- Utility: Global Money, Lightning Network, Self custody, Immutable Ledger, Decentralized, P2P, Secure (Value of utility? Compare if Bitcoin was a company how much would it be worth?)\n\n\\- Uncorrelated Asset (Value of a flight to safety)\n\n\\- Network Effect (Value if there are 100M/1B/10B etc Users)  \n\n\nI think all this is very calculatable although some is arbitrary. Would like the help of you HODLers to help me out here.",

Even if there was a price crash, what guarantee would there be that it crashes *lower* than when you originally intended to buy.\n\nSay you decide not to buy Bitcoin now at $30k, and the price goes up to $500k per coin and then, due to a USD collapse, Bitcoin collapses to $100k and stabilises, or even rebounds. Well your prediction would be correct, but you'd have to buy Bitcoin at 3x the price you could have bought it at.",
