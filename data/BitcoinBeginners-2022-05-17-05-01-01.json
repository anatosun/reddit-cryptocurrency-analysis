I continue to DCA and stack my sats. \n\nI\u2019m having trouble phrasing this so bear with me. \n\nIf we always want to have as much Bitcoin as possible, doesn\u2019t that discourage us to use/spend/sell our Bitcoin? \n\nWe will always want to hold onto the scarce item. As it increases in value due in part to the scarcity.\n\nHelp me understand, I can\u2019t see us using Bitcoin as a reserve currency in the future. Owners will never want to spend the Bitcoin that will increase in value. We will hoard it.",

You\u2019ll make the purchase regardless.\n\nIt\u2019s a very long and slow process and most likely won\u2019t happen for a couple decades, that\u2019s why you should hodl, because sometime in the future or at the very least your off springs future it might not be as volatile anymore and will resemble a much more stable asset or at the given time currency.\n\nRemember Bitcoin is still very young, as we\u2019re only in the third of like 30 halvings.\n\nIf you look at the history of gold then it has been just as volatile as Bitcoin is now. However gold is fairly stable now that it has become really scarce.",
