            "selftext": "I cannot understand the following from an article by u/vbuterin.\n\n**Question: Why would a solo miner accept a transaction with the tx fee of $0.00002?**\n\nHere is my thought. The miner's expected revenue is $0.00002 / 5000 (# of nodes) = $0.000000004. That's far smaller than the miner's cost per tx of $0.00001. It does not seem to make sense to accept it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It gets worse. Suppose that the net cost to the network of processing a transaction is close to $0.05. In theory, even if the costs are not borne by exactly the same people who set the prices, as long as the transaction fee is close to $0.05 the system would still be in balance. But what is the equilibrium transaction fee going to be? Right now, fees are around $0.09 simply because miners are too lazy to switch. But then, in the future, what happens once fees become a larger share of a miner\u2019s revenue and miners have a large incentive to try to maximize their take? The obvious answer is, for a solo miner the equilibrium transaction fee is $0.00001. If a transaction with a fee of $0.00002 comes in, and the miner adds it, the miner will have earned a profit of $0.00001, and the remaining $0.04999 worth of costs will be paid by the rest of the network together \u2013 a cryptographic tragedy of the commons. \n\nSource: [https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/02/01/on-transaction-fees-and-the-fallacy-of-market-based-solutions/](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/02/01/on-transaction-fees-and-the-fallacy-of-market-based-solutions/)",

                    "response": "The paragraph just above outlines the idea of a \"social cost\" of each transaction:\n\n>For each individual transaction that a miner includes, the costs are borne not just by that miner, but by every single node in the entire network. The cost per transaction is tiny; a miner can process a transaction and include it in a block for less than $0.00001 worth of electricity and data storage. The reason why transaction fees need to be high is because that $0.00001 is being paid by thousands of nodes all around the world.\n\nBasically the miner gets all the fee revenue, but every participant in the network pays for it: That transaction used some bandwidth while in the mempool, it's added history that every node has to store, it's added state bloat that makes it harder to sync for everyone, etc. These \"computational load\" costs are abstract and tiny for each transaction, but still non-zero and they add up. But for the miner who's only interested in making money, bundling an extra transaction with a tiny fee in his block costs him basically nothing. If there's extra space in the block, then it still makes sense to include that transaction even if it's only a tiny fee barely above the \"basically nothing\" cost of including it.\n\nHe then explores other solutions to price transactions more fairly by considering burning some kind of a basefee. interesting innit",

To me, it seems that the cost each node has to pay is very minimal, but Vitalik seems to consider the cost of all nodes as a whole. It makes sense in the perspective of the network itself, but that's not the cost each individual has to weight when they decide whether to keep being nodes or not.",

I thought you were trying to understand the quote, but it now seems not to be the case. Is it to understand the dynamics of how mining economics work, maybe? \n\nIn your scenario, miners with the biggest expenses would stop mining, while others would still mine (and would add that transaction, because it's better than nothing anyway), which would decrease mining difficulty and thus decrease mining cost until cost is slightly lower than reward, ensuring a small profit, notably to those who can cut their costs the most.",

The alternative only is earning less.\n\nAs I said, if your overall profitability is negative, you're supposed to stop mining, which will reduce costs for other miners and ensure it becomes once again profitable to mine.\n\nThat's because mining costs completely depend on mining difficulty, which depends on the total hashrate of the chain.

Furthermore, the degree of trust involved in bridge developers is surely a huge problem?\n\nI can see why Vitalk is talking about social tokens representing trust, since we seem to be discovering more and more that supposedly decentralised systems are really controlled by a few people, hence the need for those people to have a type of 'social ranking'.",

There are no real L2s, Lightning is maybe the only real L2. All of these are just separate chains with a bridge. BSC is an L2 by this definition, they all are. The only \"settling\" any of these \"L2s\" do on the L1 chain is centralized bridge transactions.... This isn't what crypto devs were really talking about when L2s became a topic lol... Yet, a lot of new people jumped in and many things have changed... this is one of them, sadly the changes are going in the wrong direction. NFTs used to be something that actually stored the correlated \"asset\" on the blockchain, now they're just id numbers and people upload what the id is supposed to be to centralized clouds like google lol... Nothing about that is immutable, there is literally no value... but thanks again new guys!",

The word people here use for that (correctly or not, I don't have a strong opinion) is \"sidechain\".\n\nWhat \"L2\" means to us is that the system gets its security from the main chain, and therefore doesn't need its own set of decentralized validators. This is true of the designs of ZKSync, Arbitrum, Optimism and [don't use this one because it has a proprietary license] Starknet. With these systems provided the L1 is working correctly, it should either be impossible to confirm an invalid transaction (zk rollup), or possible but any single user should be able to prevent it (optimistic rollup).\n\nThese systems either already have or will have bridges that share the same property, they're not just multisigs.",
