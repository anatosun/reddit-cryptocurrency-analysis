                    "response": "That's the wrong question. The real question is how much money is worth saving? Obviously, as much as you can. Collecting BTC to have 1, 2, 10, isn't the goal, it's how much fiat can I exit to a better system and how long can I hold it. 50% of my free cash flow goes into BTC DCAed daily by quarterly total funds available, the other 25% to high yield dividends, and 25% to high conviction catalyst based stocks positions that I sell covered calls against.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I find a super great real estate property I know to be undervalued, I'll pull from one or all 3 of my savings methods to acquire it. It's an ever flowing / balancing system that keeps me diversified yet laser focused on acquiring wealth. I'm up 600% since 2018, and since 2016 I went from -$200k in bad debt to positive $700k in assets. At one point I was at 20 BTC in 2020, and have fluctuated between 10-13 since. I don't trade any of my assets, I collect them to generate income. BTC is the only asset that doesn't generate income, but it's gains offset that, and convincingly I believe it always will.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCould I have sold 20 BTC at the $64k initial top, bought back at $29k, sold again at $69k top, and bought back once more at $26k for 100+ BTC for $3m+ in asset? 5 total trades, easy right? Sure... I could have also just as easily shorted BTC with 4x margin cross at $30k on the first $64k run up and lost 100% of it. Hindsight is 2020, but you're never going to kick yourself 10 years later when you've increased your assets by 3000% safely, while being able to sleep peacefully at night. Get rich slowly, build wealth that transcends generations, and produce income that allows you to retire early.",

Bitcoin is going after the market for global money and other stores of value. Currently that market is roughtly $300-$400 trillion in size. Capturing that maket would put a bitcoin price of $15 to $20 million in today's dollars.\n\nAlthough comparing todays world to a world on a bitcoin standard is like comparing apples to oranges. It's equiverlent to estimating in the 90's how much of the Fax Machine market will the internet capture. There's really no upper bound on the bitcoin value appreciation as there's always more demand for money yet an absolute fixed supply of BTC. As humans continually expand the amount of capital goods and productivity that can only be expressed in an increasing purchasing power of a hard money like bitcoin.\n\nAnouther way to estiamte its potential is just by dividing the amount of sats avalible by global population.\n\n[http://bitcoinsperperson.com/](http://bitcoinsperperson.com/)",
