No flight attendant has made any such allegation.\n\nAn \"unnamed person\" who claims to be \"friends\" with an \"unnamed flight attendant\" made up this story and found an anti-Musk media site willing to publish it.\n\nThis story is part of a broader attack by the Establishment against Musk because he exposed the widespread censorship and lack of free speech on Twitter.  Several simultaneous government investigations and personal attacks have been launched against Musk and his companies over the last few days.  It is all part of a larger effort to stop his Twitter acquisition.",
