There even celebrities and CEOs who fake it until they make it (e.g. Charles Hoskinson).\n\nSBTs would provide a reliable record of past records that would last even after the instituion or company stops existing.\n\nHere's one example of how it could work:\n\nA university, institute, or company would publish their ID to a world database or a blockchain. Even after the entity no longer exists, the ID would still be known. The subject would need to know the transaction containing their data. It doesn't matter who owns the transaction. In fact, the instituion should keep ownership in many cases. It's simply public data with a history. What is important is that the transaction would need to have been originally owned by the granting institution, which can be verified by its public ID.\n\nThat transaction could contain metadata about the name or ID of the subject, year of award, honors, and other relevant data. It would not be encrypted, or lightly encrypted by publicly known information so that anyone could verify the data. This also makes it trivial to look up rewards without having to pay for a background check on the subject.\n\nThe only weakness is garbage-in, garbage-out, so that's why the institution would have to publish their ID and have a known account. And they need to ensure their administration doesn't publish bad awards. Or a revocation system would need to exist (i.e. send to blackhole address)\n\nThere are many ways to prevent spam. Public or personal blacklist is one of them. Or just ignore them. Their records are stored on a blockchain for lookup when needed. With Merkle/Verkle trees, this can be done on any thin client. There's no need to keep track of them neatly in a single account. The original institution could keep ownership, and it would still work.",

The merging of Defi and NFT is something that we should be watching closely as Uniswap is already starting it some new projects like Teneo are already developing it as well as it's going to make new ways of earning in the space.",

And if wallets emptied as a result of someone trying to abandon their SBTs, could the SBTs move to their new wallet?",
