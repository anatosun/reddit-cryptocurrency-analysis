If all of your knowledge of rollups comes from LoopRing marketing and shills then you're not going to have a realistic view of it's place in comparison to other projects in the same space. I highly recommend that you do some unbiased comparisons yourself.",

From an investment standpoint they are still probably pretty decent considering they have 97% circulating supply. Meanwhile optimism for example is probably only going to release 30-40% of supply (correct me if I\u2019m wrong I believe I saw that). Zksync and starkware will also release tokens and Arbitrum and all of them will probably not release a full supply. \n\nSo from investment standpoints that will hurt. But yeah I think most people prefer zk in the long run but zksync and starkware seem ahead in zkevm by a significant amount over loopring and that will be the future of ethereum. That being said Looprings partnership with GameStop has the biggest chance of onboarding casual crypto users. Like right now most people haven\u2019t even heard of zksync or starkware outside of hardcore crypto people",

I remember in 2020 Solana marketed itself to have *up to* 60k tps, then at launch they claim around 10k tps, yet the real tps is only a few hundreds. Have you tried solana dapps? The speed is a bit faster than polygon, but L2s are just much faster, they\u2019re like :zap whoosh blink:\n\nOfc other chains like avalanche and polygon also a \u2018scam\u2019 since they also marketed themself to have *up to* multiple thousand tps.

But Solana's runtime is designed to expand on different cores and perform transactions in parallel (again, only txs that do not interfere, otherwise they'd all be performed on the same core). \nDepending on how many cores validators keep open for parallelism (can be 2, can be 4 etc) it opens up more blockspace. For example if the test had performed a spam of 2 different markets on an AMM that write to different accounts then the performance would have been double (but ofc the bandwidth usage would increase as well, IO, RAM etc. which will make it much more expensive for the average user to run a node - if you compute the $ cost for an entry level machine that can run a Solana node you arrive at $1500-$2000)",

Things get complicated if you want EVM which has massive complexity, and hates parallelism, but still, if L1 used advanced cryptography like zk-proofs to simplify processing it still might be achievable. I'd like to point out here that distinction between L2 and L1 is quite arbitrary - if rollups were part of the main ethereum spec would they be a L2 or L1?",
