The lucky winner will be able to enjoy pizza all year round! He or she will receive the equivalent of $2,000 in BNB. This amount should be enough to order a pizza 3 times a week for 365 days!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://cryptospection.com/binance-is-holding-a-contest-to-celebrate-bitcoin-pizza-day-win-pizza-all-year-long/](https://cryptospection.com/binance-is-holding-a-contest-to-celebrate-bitcoin-pizza-day-win-pizza-all-year-long/)",

However, one day it said \"this card is blocked\" and didn't allow me to buy any more, so I removed it from the account. Now, as I try to add it back, it gives me the \"this card cannot be added\" error, and gives me no other options. If I retry, it makes me wait for 48 hours, and I can't buy any more SHIB until this is solved. \nHas anyone else had this problem? What is the solution?",
