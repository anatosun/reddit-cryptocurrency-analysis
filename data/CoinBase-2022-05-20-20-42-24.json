The lucky winner will be able to enjoy pizza all year round! He or she will receive the equivalent of $2,000 in BNB.

However, one day it said \"this card is blocked\" and didn't allow me to buy any more, so I removed it from the account. Now, as I try to add it back, it gives me the \"this card cannot be added\" error, and gives me no other options. If I retry, it makes me wait for 48 hours, and I can't buy any more SHIB until this is solved. \nHas anyone else had this problem? What is the solution?",

EVERYONE NEEDS TO TRANSFER WHAT EVER COINS THEY HAVE OUT OF COINBASE AND STOP USING THEM. THEY ARE GETTING WORSE BY THE DAY.",
