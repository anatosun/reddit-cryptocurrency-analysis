I could see an ideal future where it's used as a global currency for everything from a cup of coffee to import/export trade. That being said, I was wondering about this particular issue with the encryption standard.\n\nEven if bitcoin is 100% adopted tomorrow, we will eventually run into an issue where quantum computers are able to break the 256 bit ECDSA encryption. What happens then?",
