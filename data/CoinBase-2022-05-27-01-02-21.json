Can you confirm if you have the hash ID of the transaction you sent from your Coinbase wallet? Can you also confirm which actions on Coinbase wallet that lead you to a connection issue? \n\nIf possible, and please make sure to make a copy of your seed phrase (don't share it to anyone including us), do the follow troubleshooting steps:\n- Update the app. \n- Update your phone software. \n- Try signing out.\n- Force quit the app.\n- Uninstall and reinstall the app.\n\nPlease provide all the details so we can double check this for you and isolate whether this is an app issue or not. Lastly, please share the case number of your previously raised support case. Thanks!",
