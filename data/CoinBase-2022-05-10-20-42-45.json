I received the UST tokens in Coinbase Wallet BUT they were called \"UST (wormhole)\". I then mistakenly tried to transfer these tokens to Coinbase Exchange. The transfer shows complete but Coinbase did not receive anything because they do NOT support that token, \"UST (wormhole)\".... Coinbase cannot do anything. Wormhole has no contact I can find. It's a LOT of money I lost. If you know anything I can do, PLEASE let me know. What an effing nightmare.",
