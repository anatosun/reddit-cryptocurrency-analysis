IMO it's the best one.So how it works is you create a profile for free, you import your wallets or exchanges by API or CSV, you can add NFTs manually, and basically, that's it. You may have to punch in some numbers here and there because some exchanges don't give enough info through API but for the most part it's smooth.Then you let Koinly do the magic, it knows what's taxable and what isn't. You select your country and cost basis method and boom! they calculate your capital gains and when you're happy, then you pay for it and receive tax forms.So technically you can use it as a portfolio tracker and try it out before you pay. It's cheap though.",
