            "selftext": "I'm sad about society in general. Sometimes I feel like we are going backwards in time. The majority of society is chasing instant gratification and ignoring what really matters: fundamentals. And it's getting worse and worse.\nSince 1913 we destroyed the fundamental property of fiat (scarcity) the consequence of that was taxes and slavery ( debt ) all over the world. Now we have an option to get out of that mindset but all i see is people talking about fiat, doing everything to get more fiat, even though fiat is a bucket full of holes ( losing 20% a year in value ). \nI blame out education system and social media. We need to start teaching our kids critical thinking again. Enough rambling: 1btc = 1btc.",
