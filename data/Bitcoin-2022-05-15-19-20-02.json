The majority of society is chasing instant gratification and ignoring what really matters: fundamentals. And it's getting worse and worse.\nSince 1913 we destroyed the fundamental property of fiat (scarcity) the consequence of that was taxes and slavery ( debt ) all over the world. Now we have an option to get out of that mindset but all i see is people talking about fiat, doing everything to get more fiat, even though fiat is a bucket full of holes ( losing 20% a year in value ). \nI blame out education system and social media. We need to start teaching our kids critical thinking again. Enough rambling: 1btc = 1btc.",

Katrina Hurricane in 2005, then the housing market crash in 2008 sent gas prices sky high for a while.  This isn't new.  We just had a decade to forget.  Then gas prices crashed during the pandemic to under a dollar in many places.  We get spoiled and then overreact when the pendulum swings the other way, which it always does.  Prices will come down again at some point.  It's not any one leader's fault.  It's a combination of many things.",
