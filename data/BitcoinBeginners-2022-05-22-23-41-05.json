A web wallet has the highest amount of things that can go wrong: client-side attacks, JavaScript crypto vulnerabilities, server-side vulnerabilities, phishing attacks (like fake blockchain.info links that ask for credentials), malware, and more. \n\nDesktop wallets suffer from some of the same problems. Mobile wallets are a bit better due to the OS/app stores being a bit more locked down, but are provide more attack surface than offline (hardware) wallets since they are general purpose, networked devices. \n\nBut a dedicated hardware wallet provides the safest interface as the keys are generated and stored completely offline, and cannot be retrieved off the device when connected for signing transactions.",
