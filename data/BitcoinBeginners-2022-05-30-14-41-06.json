Potentially you could pay so little it never confirms. The optimal fee amount can be a pain to figure out and wallets tend to cover this all up by saying fast/normal/slow but even slow is usually a bit more than the optimal lowest fee option to prevent users who don't understand all this from complaining to the devs constantly.",

If you want to ensure your transaction is included in the next block, you have to beat the highest current fees in the mempool; if you don't care at all if your transaction might take a week, you can probably just fire it off with a 1 sat/vByte fee and check in on it later. For any time between those two, you should be looking at fee estimators, such as https://mempool.space/ or https://twitter.com/CoreFeeHelper, for example.",
