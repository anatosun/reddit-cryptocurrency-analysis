This is saved in the blockchain. \n\nThis 1 BTC is now yours because you are the only one who can prove that ABC is your address. \n\nNow les say you want to send  this 1 BTC to my Address XYZ. Then you create a transaction which says: \"Here is the proof I own 1 BTC on address ABC and I transfer this 1 BTC to anyone who can prove that he owns XYZ\". \n\nWhat your hardware wallet does is it creates the proof that you own ABC by signing the transaction. It can create a valid signature because it knows the private key to ABC.",

The miner sees that this transaction is valid, because only the owner of the adresses private key could have signed it so he puts the transaction into next block.\n\nEveryone can steal signatures because they are public in the blockchain, but old signatures are of no use. you can't alter a transaction because then the transaction data changes and the signature becomes invalid.  Only the private key owner would be the one who could create an new valid signature for a modified transation.\n\nAnd thats why hardware wallets are very safe against malware: the private key never leaves the device. The software sends an unsigned transaction to the hardware wallet and receives a signed one back.   \nWhat malware could do in the worst case is alter the unsigned transaction before it is sent to the hardware wallet, eg by changing the receiving address to attackers address.  \n\nAnd thats why hardware wallets usually show you the receiving address on their display and you have to confirm manually that it really is the address you want to transfer to.",

Your private key is like your password - if you have it, you can retrieve your email. So if you don\u2019t keep your private key safe, it\u2019s like letting someone have your email password, etc. a hardware wallet is one way to keep your private key safe. \n\nIf you are smart and paranoid, you will also get a new public wallet / address every time you receive Bitcoin. This way nobody can track your movements in the blockchain or associate a large number of transactions with one wallet. The blockchain is encrypted/anonymous, but someone who was really trying could find you - especially if they sent you a little BTC and marked where it was on the blockchain, and from there just keep finding that key on the blockchain. \n\nAnyway.",
