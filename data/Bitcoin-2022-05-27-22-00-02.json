Send Bitcoin to that address as you stack sats and forget about anything else until years from now when Bitcoin takes over as the world reserve currency and you need to move it again.

Make two seed backups (paper, metal, brain,...), because Tails is an amnesiac system, meaning it will forget all settings, including your seed, upon reboot.\n\nHere are old but very explanatory videos of how cold storage with Electrum works:\n\n* Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9K3CozQpzM\n* Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK4JmfMCDBg (redundant, because Tails exists)\n* Part 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBVyFRb6ZZc\n\nTip: If you're using an Android device (a $50 tablet is enough) as your online-connected watch-only device, you can very handily transport unsigned and signed transactions between the laptop and the Android device using QR-codes.\n\n**ATTENTION:** The only legitimate source from which Electrum can be obtained is https://electrum.org. By using the Electrum installation that comes with Tails (https://tails.boum.org is the only legitimate place to obtain Tails from), you're introducing one possibly weak link into your setup. Same goes for downloading the Electrum app on Android. While the Google Play Store might be relatively secure, as is Tails, relatively secure, you do introduce another point of failure and trust. Learn how to download, verify and use the official Electrum releases from https://electrum.org. You can see Thomas Voegtlin's (the lead developer of Electrum) GPG-fingerprint in this video, where he is giving a lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjYCXOyDy7Y. Here is a reproduction of that fingerprint:\n\n`6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6`",
