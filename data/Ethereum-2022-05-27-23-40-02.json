If you're still making trades or buying NFTs on Layer one, you're burning money.\n\n***ROLLUPS ARE HERE***\n\nLayer 2 rollups are ready today!  Including [Loopring](https://loopring.org/), [zkSync](https://zksync.io/), [Optimistic Ethereum](https://www.optimism.io/), and [Arbitrum](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/).  No more of that sidechain/sister chain business, we can support Ethereum by moving our assets to any of these layer two chains and increasing Liquidity incentives.  The more of us on L2 the better the sandbox becomes.\n\n***FOR THE NEWBIES***\n\nFor those of you who are newbies and have never opened a crypto wallet, or those just doing small trades I'd recommend [Loopring Wallet](https://loopring.io/#/wallet) or [Argent Wallet](https://www.argent.xyz/) (powered by zkSync/starknet).  Both of these systems use smart wallets and make holding crypto stupid proof!  When these scaling solutions launch EVM smart contract, anybody will be able to have world class security for less than than a few dollars.\n\n***FOR THE OUT OF THE LOOP CRYPTO VETERANS***\n\nIf you're a bit more experienced, have some crypto savings or just want to continue interacting with Dapps, try bridging your funds to [Arbitrum](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) or [Optimism](https://gateway.optimism.io/)!  Contract calls are roughly around $1 and make trading easy.  They do lack a bit of liquidity, BUT, the more of us that transfer to these L2 solutions, the more incentive there is for liquidity providers to move!\n\n***WE ALL NEED TO MOVE TO L2 IN ORDER TO INCENTIVIZE LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS TO MOVE!***\n\n\"*But mrcleansocks, all my funds are on binance and coinbase? how am i supposed to get to layer 2 without touching layer 1 gas fees?\"*\n\n**EASY!**\n\nYou need to go to [Layerswap](https://www.layerswap.io/)!  They will help you bridge your funds from CEX's to L2s!  No more dirty nasty layer one gas fees to stop you from being your own bank. SO GET ON IT!\n\nOn a twitter spaces call between Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, and Starknet, they all said that sub 1 cent transactions are coming!  We are on the verge of Layer 2 2022!!!! It's happening! We are scaling!  But we all need to get off layer one!  So get your shit together and let's roll squad, we're building the new world and it's on Layer two now!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit - Honestly, mods, we need a sticky post to address this. If you're too lazy, just pin this post so people can find their way to L2",

Aren't each one of these basically completely different networks that are competing with each other (and secured by ethereum)?\n\nSo for instance, if I want to run a particular application or service, is that going to be on a specific L2, and then I will have to transfer funds over to THAT L2 in order to use the application? Or if I want to send money to a friend who is using an L2, I need to be on the same one? Or is that not how any of this works, and it doesn't really matter which one I choose, because they can interoperate with each other?",

Infact the only important dApps I use that aren't on a rollup yet are AAVE and Alchemix. Everything else: Curve, Balancer, Synthetix, dYdX, Lyra is on at least one.\n\nI'm sympathetic to your point about ENS names, but really how often do you need to buy or re-register those...?\n\nFor DAOs the majority of governance just involves signing transactions, so no fee and so again it can stay on L1 (though the POAPs you might get for attending meetings etc. will be on the XDAI sidechain).\n\nAnd as for NFTs, you literally listed ImmutableX as one of the places you buy NFTs... which runs on StarkWare's L2!\n\nIt sounds more like you've decided not to like rollups for some reason and are letting that bias cloud your view of reality. You can't do everything on L2s yet, but the extract of your comment I quoted above is just factually wrong.",

So much of the regulations coming down the line are gonna be in response to weirdos who are in crypto just to avoid taxes. I do appreciate that. \n\nI meant like the protocol should \"tax\" these sorts of DeFi actions that make up a lot of blockspace. There's these arbitrage bots that will spend $600 in gas fees if it makes them $601 in returns at the end. If we made it more expensive to use these lending and staking and swapping dApps, if it cost more gas to make those kinds of actions, there'd be more block space for the kinds of things I want to do. \n\nI don't think I need to respond to the other points, because I'm not principally against L2s or anything. I like ImmutableX a lot. It sucks that it costs so much for me to withdraw my enormous airdrop to a place where I can actually spend it on rent. As an L2, I think it's quite successful, and a better example than anything OP mentioned. Mintable lets you mint straight to ImmutableX, and I wish more of my artist friends would use it. It's great.\n\nI admit, I didn't know Gitcoin worked on zkSync. You're exactly right that that's another thing I really want to use blockchain for. I knew they worked on Polygon, but I've been a bit apprehensive about Polygon sidechain, so I haven't gone that route yet. I'll look into zkSync for the next Gitcoin round, cause that's really important to me.",

But yet, when they enable their roll-up, that gives our smart contracts the full security of Eth regardless of the Matic network's possible point of failure.

At least poly is not a walled garden, and they do provide a valuable service for side-chain computation to write on the main chain (which, faster cheaper computation is desperately needed until The Surge, and still useful after). If they push off their Zkrollup functionality too long then that becomes a power grab red flag though, but i doubt this'll happen given their recent investments.",

To improve efficiency, they use a whole host of fancy compression tricks to replace data with computation wherever possible. The result is a system where scalability is still limited by the data bandwidth of the underlying blockchain, but at a very favorable ratio: whereas an Ethereum base-layer ERC20 token transfer costs ~45000 gas, an ERC20 token transfer in a rollup takes up 16 bytes of on-chain space and costs under 300 gas.\n\nThe fact that data is on-chain is key. Putting data on-chain and having consensus on that fact allows anyone to locally process all the operations in the rollup if they wish to, allowing them to detect fraud, initiate withdrawals, or personally start producing transaction batches. The lack of data availability issues means that a malicious or offline operator can do even less harm (eg. they cannot cause a 1 week delay), opening up a much larger design space for who has the right to publish batches and making rollups vastly easier to reason about. And most importantly, the lack of data availability issues means that there is no longer any need to map assets to owners, leading to the key reason why the Ethereum community is so much more excited about rollups than previous forms of layer 2 scaling: rollups are fully general-purpose, and one can even run an EVM inside a rollup, allowing existing Ethereum applications to migrate to rollups with almost no need to write any new code.",

With fraud/validity proofs the main chain can be sure that the L2 followed the rules with very little computation.\n\nMain chain is fully decentralized and easy to participate in because the hardware requirements are reasonable. L2 is not necessarily easy to participate in, but the proofs make sure that they cannot cheat.\n\nSolana is an example of the architecture you're thinking of. Its basically an L2 without an L1. Immense hardware requirements. Difference is that its not possible for you to verify that solana is following the rules. You *have* to trust that the few people running nodes are honest. It has been suggested that [solana should simply pivot towards becoming a rollup on Ethereum](https://np.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/paspos/solanas_endgame_becoming_an_ethereum_rollup/). \n\nDoes this answer your question?",

Let's focus on this: Rollups off-load heavy computation from the main chain to a chain with much higher computational demand.\n\nFirst of all, there is no \"heavy computation\" on the chain anyway. The computation is done by the miners/validators. Since the L2 computers will have to do that that \"heavy computation\" why not do it as L1 miners/validators?\n\nI understand the point of the compressed proof in batched transactions, but again fail to see why not have the L1 validators/miners batch a bunch of transactions and compress them to a single hash if that's enough? The L2 validators (or sequencers) have the same job as the block producers on L1. Just produce compressed blocks on L1 if they are so good. It just makes no sense that L2 is as secure as L1 but somehow L2 is so much better in thruput.\n\nSolana is basically ditching old state quickly. Am I to understand that L2 is simply going to ditch the old state? And if so then that's proof it's nowhere near as secure as L1. Further that also suggests that the user of the L2 must always keep their receipts as keys if they want to exit the rollup which makes it so much harder to use properly as designed, at that point might as well use Solana.",

This allows it to use higher-end hardware and provide more throughput than a maximally-decentralized L1 can offer while still maintaining the transaction integrity offered by that L1. The main problem with L2s is that they start out relatively centralized and therefore could be subject to censorship, but that's a fairly easy problem to solve.",

(the explainer videos I watched were a bit abstract and didn\u2019t go into the detail of the real world implantation)\n\n\nOptimism sounds risky. I have a burden to prove fraud? What if I don\u2019t know how to do this? Perhaps I only know how to prove unsophisticated attempts at fraud, but sophisticated ones go right by me. Concerning. \n\nZK rollups sound more promising from my initial reading, but I still remain cautious. How much real world field testing do these solutions have? Am I going to find in five years time I can\u2019t retrieve my funds because the protocol had a flaw in it? At least L1 has been through its infancy period and critical weaknesses have had time to be found. \n\n\nSo yeah I guess these are my general hesitations for using L2. It feels a bit too distant from the real funds, and I need to trust some new technology layer that has had far less usage than L1. Perhaps after hundreds of billions of dollars have been transferred and stored on L2 for the long term, like L1, I would be more confident",
