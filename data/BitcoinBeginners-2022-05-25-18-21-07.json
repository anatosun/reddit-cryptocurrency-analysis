Follow this all the way to the last screen and it will show you the fee that you'll be charged - you will then know the cost of doing it this way. You can do a similar thing with convert (from btc to some other coin). Just keep playing with various options and compare the fees that would be charged. I find this better than looking at fee listings coz there always seems to be some fee hidden when you get to the end",
