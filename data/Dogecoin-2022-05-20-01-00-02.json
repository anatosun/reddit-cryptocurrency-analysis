No. Because as others have pointed out, the structure and mechanisms are completely different. We have nothing remotely like their model for price controls. Which, given the spectacular failure, is a very good thing.\n\nCan the price crash to near zero, or even zero with no chance of recovery? Absolutely yes. And there are two scenarios where this could happen.\n\nIn the mild case, people can simply decide en-masse that Doge is no longer worth being involved in, and all cash out simultaneously. With all sellers and no buyers, the price would tank all the way to fractions of a cent. And it would keep falling until someone decided it was time to buy. This happens, to a point, from time to time. It\u2019s happening right now, in fact, thanks to global concerns.\n\nThe terminal case is another matter. Suppose the price did tank. To a point that the mining rewards became so worthless that there was no point mining. Then people would simply unplug their miners. Maybe sell them, maybe find some other coin to mine instead, maybe just put them in the cupboard. This HAS happened. In fact, it was the reason why Charlie Lee came up with AuxPoW to save us from a certain death. And the fact that our mining is now done by LTC pools goes a long way to making a repetition unlikely. But not impossible.\n\nIf the hashrate did drop off a cliff, we could reach a point where it was economically viable for someone to buy or rent enough hashpower to gain 51% of the total, and thereby the ability to rewrite the blockchain at will. They could literally spend coins then immediately steal them back. If this were to happen, it would completely destroy all trust. The price would plunge to zero and never recover. It would be the death of Dogecoin.",

MultiDoge uses .wallet files.\n\nAssuming Core contained most of your coins, you can recover pretty easily.\n\n1. Instal a fresh copy of the latest Core. Fire it up, let it build its files, then quit.\n2. Swap in a copy of your wallet.dat, replacing the new one.\n3. Fire it up again. There is no need to let it sync though.\n4. Go into the console and use the DUMPWALLET command to create a text file with all your wallets in it.\n5. Look at this text file. You will see at least a hundred wallets, in three groups. Named wallets are the ones you knew about. Change wallets are where any change was sent to when you spent coins. Reserve wallets are unused spares.\n6. Save this text file to a USB stick. Grab a copy of the coinb.in website and put that on the stick too. Make copies. Put them in safe places\n7. Throw away Core. You don\u2019t need it at all, because you now have safe, secure, cold storage.\n\nNow, as to MD. I\u2019m not the right guy to ask for details, but the process is sort of similar. Except that there\u2019s a button that will export your keys. It gives two options, and you want the plaintext, not the encrypted one. Once you have wallets you can read, add them to the file you got from Core.\n\nRinse and repeat for any other data files. Most are likely backup copies, but you never know, so it\u2019s worth checking. Of course you can delete any duplicates. Easiest way to do this is to make sure you\u2019ve added a comment to any wallets that have coins in them (or which had coins but now have zero balances), then sort the file which will gather the duplicates together. You may need to play with formatting first though.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got your wallet masterfile, you can add any other wallets to it. Like for example your SoDogeTip wallet. Any wallets you\u2019re currently using. Or a batch of new wallets to keep as spares. For example, you can export the new wallets from core back in step 1.\n\nWhy have all these wallets, I hear you ask? Because for privacy, security and auditability, you really want a separate wallet for each entity or purpose you interact with. And you never want to mix coins between them, because once linked in the blockchain, you can never unlink them.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nEdit: Forgot to say, search for \u2018text wallet\u2019 and have a read.",

And no, it has no idea what coins any wallet contains. All you\u2019re doing is dumping the entire list of wallets to a file.\n\nHmmm\u2026.\n\nYou can go old school for a quickie check, but it\u2019s much more tedious.\n\nBack before DUMPWALLET, the only option was to use DUMPPRIVKEY. Give it a wallet address and it will return the key in the console window. Then you need to copy paste both to a text file, rinse and repeat, and finally edit the file to clean up the structure into something more usable.\n\nYou could do this for a wallet you know has coins. But there is a limitation, in that you must know the addresses first. And of course you don\u2019t know about the change wallets. That can be gotten around too, by turning on coin control and going to the send tab, but you must have at least one block loaded for every wallet that has coins in it, so it requires at least a partial sync.\n\nLike I said, messy, but it is a backstop.",
