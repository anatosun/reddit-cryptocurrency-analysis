They are wagering financial warfare on each other! Of course there's going to be turbulence because all of the worlds measure of value are in their last death throws trying to suck whatever oxygen that is left in the room. They are all based on debt that A can't be paid back and B when it is finally paid back it's worth less than the original principle. Bitcoin is the answer and so many refuse or can't see it yet. The collective faith of humanity doesn't come overnight. It comes over time.\n\nEvery time they print those zeros into their database they are stealing your labor and pricing it less than zero.\n\nBitcoin is our collective weapon against their financial debt trap. It's for our future through in through.\n\nAnd remember. One Bitcoin will always be 1 Bitcoin",
