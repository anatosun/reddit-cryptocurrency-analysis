I didn't want to do this but somehow he changed my mind and I decided to send all my coins (700~$) to this \"exchange\" in order to buy cheap coins there and sell them for higher price in binance. When I sent my money on his scam site, my coins gone... I know and totally understand that it's 100% my fault that I trusted him, but still despite this fact I don't have money now at all and have loan for apartment which I must pay, but I don't have money and will be kicked out fron my only one home pretty soon...\n\nThe quastion is does someone can trace on which wallet my crypto coins were sent? If it is binance, then I could recover my funds! Does anybody can help me with this huge problem for me?",

The same would apply to a wad of cash you hand someone during a verbal agreement for services rendered. You can't prove any services were guaranteed to be rendered nor can you prove said guarantee wasn't fulfilled in the absence of a contract.\n\nBitcoin is perfect money and requires no intermediary but does require you to know who you're sending your money to and to only do so after an agreement has already been met. If no agreement is met, no money should be sent.",
