            "selftext": "So I've been wondering as to what exactly is the \"second layer\" in the context of the Lightning Network. The way I understand it, it's actually independent from the Bitcoin Network. You send your bitcoin to a \"large wallet\" where it joins a different network that follows its own rules and eventually you withdraw from that large wallet back into your own BTC wallet over the Bitcoin Network.\n\nMy understanding of the second layer is thus :\n\nBTC Network -> Large wallet within which ownership is determined by a different system -> BTC Network\n\nIn that sense, an exchange would be a second layer, unless we add decentralisation as a part of the definition.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Y  \n\nThat is not correct.  \n\nLightning Network, for example, uses partially signed Bitcoin transactions, which can eventually be executed on the Bitcoin main net, using actual Bitcoin.  \n\nLearn more here, for example:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zG8PZsHLung",

To this end, below the \"main layer\" (the bitcoin prime that we see mined today), which exists as a stable ionic compound of charged coins recorded in 'blocks', is a fluid layer of isogeometrically directed coin traffic that doesn't have to conform to the same rules that the main layer does.\n\nThis is the \"second layer' about which you ask, and is much more suitable for faster transactions or numerous smaller transactions because it doesn't have to be mined or verified on the blockchoon and behaves according to fluid dynamics.  There are many benefits to this layer which you can google.",
