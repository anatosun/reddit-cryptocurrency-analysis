Certainly not enough to become the main maintainer of the project.\n\nIt\u2019s why when I think of Rust, I mainly think of hobbyists projects and Linux Kernel development. I have yet to see a widely maintained popular project in Rust, I think Alacrity comes close. \n\nJust to clarify, I am not shitting on Rust. I daily drive Alacrity and have used Rust in the past.

For a programming language, I just don\u2019t think it matters to much, use whatever you feel comfortable with. I think for the most part to much emphasis is placed on the programming language when in reality most speed improvements come from good software implementation. That being said some programming languages do help you right better code and Rust is one of them. I just think that people saying that it is going to replace everything or rewriting every application in Rust are hyping it up to much. For an Execution Client, I would probably use anything other Geth mainly to maintain client diversity",
