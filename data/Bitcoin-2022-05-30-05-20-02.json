History is filled with human wars where different tools used to kill. The problem remains people and always will be and arguing about what tools is used is pointless. \n\nWhen person lacking moral campus, this is what you get, fix that, you fix the other issues. \nAs long our society is filled with perpetual hate, expect worse to happen and denying it will bring further misery.\n\nThis is the same problem with drugs, sex trafficking etc. We are targeting the suppliers but not the demands.\n\nIf guns issues then how gun makers aka defense companies are still in business? They are in business, because there are demands for what they make.\n\nIt is astonishing that the public been wasting their time since the 70s with such issue along with other such as inequality, racism, women rights, etc, because the public still blinded by accepting emotional reaction  rather than strategic planning.

The individuals leading and working in these corporations have traditional educations that don't cover BTC like they do bonds, equities, commodities, macro/micro, etc. When you do your masters in finance or economics right now, you might barely touch on BTC. The conferences and continuing education in these fields also barely touch on BTC compared to other subjects.\n\nAdditionally, when you get certified as a CPA, CFA, or CFP you are barely required to know anything about BTC (maybe some crypto). The regulating bodies, academia, and certification boards are all still learning. They haven't even decided how to account for BTC!\n\nIf you think the world is fully educated on BTC and the market currently reflects that, then BTC is doomed.

El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender and they made it so that Salvadorans don't have to keep track of their cost basis when buying/selling/spending bitcoin and they don't have to pay capital gains tax on bitcoin gains. That is great for the Salvadorans that want to use bitcoin to receive remittances (remittances account for 23% of El Salvador's gross domestic product). But US dollars are also still legal tender in El Salvador and the US dollar is still the most widely used currency in El Salvador.",
