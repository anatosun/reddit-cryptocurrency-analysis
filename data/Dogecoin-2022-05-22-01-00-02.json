The same is true with all the other coins too, if it was going to go back up, it would\u2019ve done so already. Here\u2019s the reason, no one is buying crypto anymore, nobody can afford to spend the extra income since prices have inflated to the point where people making $20hr are barely getting by with gas and groceries. The only way crypto will come back is if prices for goods drop significantly.\n\nIt\u2019s simple economics, cost and demand, there\u2019s not as much demand anymore so the cost has gone down. That simple.",
