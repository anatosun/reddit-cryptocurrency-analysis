Slashing is something that routinely happens as part of the protocol if you cast contradictory votes.\n\nIn both PoW and PoS, someone could control 51% of the stake/hashrate and cause trouble. In both cases the community would try to do something about it, by coordinating to make a hard fork which punishes the attackers. This coordination in this process could involve centralization (eg Vitalik or Pieter who controls Bitcoin Core Github repo) might say \"everyone download this version\" and everyone might reply \"yes boss\") or it could be a broader social process with no single power centre. \n\nThe difference is that if you have to do this, in PoS it can be targetted at the misbehaving stakers, whereas in PoW the best you can do is change the PoW algorithm, which hurts all miners.",

The other validators, despite being the minority, says fxxk those guys according to the Casper protocol and slash their deposits.\n\nNow you have a fraudulent chain created by the attacker and another chain maintained by the honest validators. The idea is that community would choose the honest chain and the attackers lose all their stakes.\n\nIMO Casper is like a consensus and SOP on what to do in case of an attack. What Vitalik meant by \"we\" is probably the community as a whole and not some eth devs.",
