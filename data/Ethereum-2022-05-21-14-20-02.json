They are referring to the following tweet made by Vitalik Buterin in 2017.\n\nIf  it's really going to be centralized, then do you think that the investors will still have the same interest in ETH that they are having now?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c9j0uc618u091.jpg?width=652&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64fd734ce44d1045dedc777461521664ca582c86",

The other validators, despite being the minority, says fxxk those guys according to the Casper protocol and slashed their deposits.\n\nNow you have a fraudulent chain created by the attacker and another chain maintained by the honest validators. The idea is that community would choose the honest chain and the attackers lose all their stakes.\n\nIMO Casper is like a consensus on what to do in case of an attack. What Vitalik meant by \"we\" is probably the community as a whole and not some eth devs.",
