Buying Bitcoin at $9K was already something obvious if you understood the why of Bitcoin, just as it was at $3.8K in March 2020 or $69K in November 2021. The guarantees Bitcoin gives you are related to its protocol and design, not to its price.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.
