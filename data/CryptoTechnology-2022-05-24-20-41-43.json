            "selftext": "Hello, I'm relatively new to binance and started investing earlier this year. I was wondering if there is any possibility to see exactly how much profit/loss one has made with the overall wallet, but also with the individual coins.  \nSecond question: What is the difference between savings and staking? On mobile, they are combined but on pc i can see that they are in different categories. And also I seem to get more profits out of the savings account. So what is the difference (maybe also advantages/disadvantages, if one can say such a thing)  \nThanks for the help in advance.",
