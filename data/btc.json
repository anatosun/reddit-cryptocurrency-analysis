I might not even have been involved in BCH -- he got me to participate early on along with Amaury at ABC.  \n\nHe got me to participate again and helped found BCHN when we wanted to break away from ABC.  He was a key person in all of that and I think had he not existed I would not be as involved as I have been. He was a catalyst for the right things to happen at the right time and he helped lots of people coalesce and work together.\n\nI have to thank him deeply for all his hard work and passion and for his strong moral stance on things.  He is a very honest person and a tremendously hard working and conscientious person.  He truly loves BCH.",

With that logic we should have stayed at 1MB blocks since we don't usually fill those either.\n\nThe demand is there. The reason the demand isn't finding our blockchain is because it's still unproven to scale in the real world. There I said it.\n\nWe should have already published a 256MB mainnet test block. The only reason we haven't is lack of focus. No offense to you or anyone out there. Devs tend to congregate around trendy problems to be solved, which is why we now have a derelict token system instead of a more scalable blockchain.\n\nI am here to help us regain focus. Any goal that supersedes scaling is a bad goal.\n\nThanks again for your contributions. I respect your work.",

That's it.\n\nPokket.cash is the only BCH-only wallet I know of that adheres to the \"no bullshit\" principle. Except the UI/UX leaves a bit to be desired before I'm comfortable sharing it with my non-technical friends. (No offense Pokkst but like most Bitcoin-related/FOSS software, it looks like an engineer designed it and I know from talking to you that it's very unlikely to change)\n\nOf course, instead of whining, I do intend on taking matters into my own hands, but it's time-consuming. It's unfortunate that we have such a drought of developers because there are so many things that both need to get done and would be really cool for BCH.",

If Bitcoin ever sees widespread adoption, only the wealthy will be able to afford L1 transactions, which are required to open and close LN channels and adjust liquidity. This effectively means the poor will be forced to establish LN channels with large centralized nodes.\n\nThese centralized nodes will ultimately become middlemen that can charge fees and surveil all traffic through them. Even though theoretically people will have the freedom to move their BTC liquidity to other channels, in reality the economics of the situation will make it impossible and people without much wealth will be stuck without a choice.\n\nIt appears to me that in their apparent quest to pursue maximum decentralization by limiting the blocksize, Bitcoiners have actually locked themselves into a solution that will guarantee centralization if it is adopted at scale.

ETH's block interval is currently 14 seconds, and will be switching to 12 seconds once The Merge (transition to PoS) takes place. Substantially shorter block intervals are difficult to achieve because the BLS signature aggregation process for the ETH2/Casper PoS consensus mechanism takes a fair amount of time (due largely to network latency and speed-of-light delays), but this limitation is unrelated to transaction throughput.\n\nIf you're alleging that this article entails that BCH is somehow better than Ethereum because BCH hasn't yet hit its scaling limit, then you're missing the point -- BCH's 600-second-average random block time isn't remotely competitive with ETH2's 12 second deterministic block time, and BCH is unlikely to beat ETH on that front unless BCH switches to PoS too.\n\nBCH may have a lead in layer 1 transaction throughput, but ETH still has a lot of room to grow in both layer 1 and layer 2 transaction throughput. ETH has a disadvantage in L1 throughput due to its inefficient/heavy database structure and relative difficulty of parallelizing transaction execution in account-based models vs UTXO models, but ETH has an advantage in L2 throughput due to its Turing-complete scripting system and the amount of work that's been invested in L2 infrastructure already.",

The rest is eaten by various fees.\n\nThere are various problems with Ethereum layer 2 approach\n\n- lack of a universal stanard\n\n- being abused by pump and dumpters that start tribal wars between the various L2 approaches.\n\n- L2's not being compatible with one another.\n\n- Some L2's are just plain unsafe and can get rugged by the team at any time\n\n- When the bear market comes and L1 fees go down again, there won't be an incentive to move liquidity away from L1. and there won't be much funding going to L2 devs. People will say: we don't need L2 anymore, fees are low on L1!\n\n\nAnd so the current Ethereum L2 approach is a big complex mess that is only solved by something like Avax or smartBCH.  \n\nHowever before everybody figures this out we are 15 years in the future ....\n\nThe next 2 cycles you will see ETH dominace grow and BTC dominance srhink but more and more ETH dapps will move to Avax and smartBCH and eventually Avax and smartBCH will become much more usefull. If part of the stock market ever moves to crypto, they will move to smartBCH and avax, not Ethereum.\n\nEthereum has enough momentum to overtake BTC after which all BTC maxis will become ETH maxis.\n\nBut it wont enjoy that top status for very log before Ethereum itself starts falling.\n\nThe first couple of implementations of new technology never make it. Especially not the ones that grow to big to fast and become very hard to change or adapt to ever changing circumstances.",

                    "response": "Those are good points. In addition, I would like to add some other points as well.\n\n**Benefits of Bitcoin Cash for Everyone**\n\n- For the first time in human history, Bitcoin Cash allows you to be in full control of your own money. Bitcoin Cash is peer to peer money that cannot be frozen by the banks nor the government.\n\n- With Bitcoin Cash, you place your trust in the laws of Math and Cryptography rather than putting your trust in people.\n\n- Send or receive any amount of Bitcoin Cash, to anyone, anywhere, instantly and almost for free. No lengthy bank forms to fill in and no private information required from both the sender and recipient.\n\n- Whenever you are frustrated with the long queues in the bank to make a transaction, imagine how much time you had wasted, and how many millions other people are wasting their time in the bank queues every single day. Bitcoin Cash saves time and money for millions of people every single day.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash helps to connect the billions of unbanked people, with valuable talents and expertise, to the global economy, creating millions of new job opportunities and increasing economic growth for the entire world.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash enables micro transactions so you can write articles or create video contents and earn money immediately by people who like your work.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash has high volatility which could be seen as an issue or an opportunity, depending on your perspective. If something is $1 today and 20 years later, it is still $1, then there is no investment opportunity.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash protects your purchasing power from inflation and hyperinflation, similar to gold and silver, because it exists outside the banking system of fiat money.\n\n- Unlike fiat money, Bitcoin Cash cannot be counterfeited, so there is zero chance of you holding fake money.\n\n- New bank regulations with regards to bail-ins and bail-outs means the banks can confiscate depositors funds legally and anytime during a financial crisis and there is no recourse for you.\n\n- Banks can shut down and disappear along with the depositors money but Bitcoin Cash has a perfect track record of being online 24 hours a day, every single day, and had been doing so since 2009.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash payments, with CashShuffle and CashFusion, are private Internet money. This means you can send/receive money with anyone privately without having to give out your private information, useful in situations when you want to donate money to an organization without risk being implicated in the process.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is an insurance against corrupted governments. Given a long enough time, eventually a group of corrupted politicians will win the election and take control over the country to enrich themselves. Bitcoin Cash gives you the freedom to move your wealth anywhere and relocate anytime to a safer haven.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash allows you to bypass financial censorships, restrictions and sanctions because it is unstoppable peer to peer money.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today.\n\n- If you were aware of the protests currently going on in Hong Kong, India, Iran, Chile, Bolivia, and other countries, you have to wonder how a minority government could suppress and control millions of citizens.\n\nTurns out if you have an unlimited money printing machine, you could control the entire nation. You could use it to pay for the police and military to beat up the civilians. You could use it to bribe the politicians to look the other way. You could use it to pay for propaganda campaigns. You could use it to invest in companies to prevent them from speaking up.\n\nWhen you remove their unlimited money printing machine, you also reduce their ability to suppress and control the people. Suddenly, the power shifts back into the people\u2019s hands because nobody can print more Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash\u2019s supply is fixed and there will only be 21 million Bitcoin Cash forever.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is programmable money which allows for smart contracts, tokens, oracles, dividends, anonymous bearer shares, and so much new innovations that wasn\u2019t possible before. It is like the very early periods of the Internet age where it is a rapidly evolving technology and crazy amount of new innovations happen regularly and yet people barely know anything about the Internet at that point.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Benefits of Bitcoin Cash for Merchants**\n\n- Bitcoin Cash transactions are instant and safe.\n\n- Risk of chargebacks is nearly zero.\n\n- No more worries about credit card frauds.\n\n- No more worries about centralized payment systems such as PayPal freezing or stealing your money like what had happened to thousands of PayPal users.\n\n- No payment processing fee. As a merchant, you receive 100% of the amount paid to you by the customer.\n\n- Super easy to get started. Just install the Bitcoin.com Wallet and the Bitcoin Cash Register App and you can start accepting Bitcoin Cash payments within minutes.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash does not stigmatize or treat any businesses differently. If you run an organization that banks or governments may not like, you risk having your funds being confiscated anytime like what happened to the funds donated to help Hong Kong Protestors. Bitcoin Cash cannot be taken away by the banks nor the government without your permission.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How You Can Help This Peer To Peer Cash Revolution**\n\n- Spend Bitcoin Cash whenever possible. You can buy anything with Bitcoin Cash on Amazon today with up to 30% using the Purse.io service. You can pay for air tickets, hotels, food and other services using Bitcoin Cash today. Visit AcceptBitcoin.Cash or Map.Bitcoin.com to look for participating merchants today!\n\n- Pay your employees in Bitcoin Cash to help build a closed loop economy. Request to be paid in Bitcoin Cash if you\u2019re the employee.\n\n- Help educate and spread the benefits of Bitcoin Cash to family and friends, or you can just direct them to this page!\n\n- Make small donations to open source developers contributing their free time voluntarily to build applications and services for the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.\n\n- Everytime someone tries to sell you something, ask them if they accept Bitcoin Cash.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSource: https://slp.1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame",

Has a huge network effect and lots of devs and investment.\n\nSmartBCH:  Ethereum, if it was linked to Bitcoin (BCH), and only 6 months old.  You can swap BCH <> smartBCH, so it's the same 21 million coins.  Supports the EVM, therefore all code and projects from Ethereum can be copied across, but it lacks users and liquidity because it is new.  However, because it is new, it was developed without a lot of technical debt and a clean slate, and is up to 80x more scaleable than Ethereum - and that will probably increase.  Unlike Ethereum, it is backed by Bitcoin miners (instead of upcoming Proof of stake), which has some pros (it adds to the scaleability just mentioned, among other things) and some cons (environmental complaints from doubters), but largely pros since the Bitcoin miners are already mining BTC/BCH anyway.\n\nSolana: Relatively newer chain.  I don't know the tech much, maybe someone else can explain, but it is essentially very centralised - it has had numerous occassions, including recently, where the entire chain is down and/or the devs have to make sudden manual fixes.  By being centralised, it promises to support much higher throughput, although the issues with that approach are coming to the surface as I mentioned.  Has a lot of hype among very new crypto investors, and probably huge amounts of VC coins which will unlock and flood the market at some point.\n\nThat's my best attempt.\n\nhttps://bitcoincashpodcast.com/faqs/BCH/what-is-smart-bch\n\nhttps://bitcoincashpodcast.com/faqs/Cryptocurrency/what-about-ethereum-eth\n\nhttps://bitcoincashpodcast.com/start#episode-9-of-10-ethereum-dogecoin-tether-and-more",

You have to do something in the real world using real resources which is hard and competitive. PoS doesn't have to touch the real world at all which is why all the new coins and new projects are using PoS because you don't have to make a big investment in tangible items that cost money and have a robust network to start. I think most people in crypto are here to get rich quick and the way to do that is by creating a brand new coin and hype it up, so people pre mine it, give themselves a lot, and make it PoS so it's easy to hit the ground running. How many new PoW coins get created? Btc BCH doge Monero - what else is there? Tbh I don't understand it fully but the fact that it's such a hard thing to replicate, the network itself has value because it's harder to build. Which is why I even think doge might have a future compared to shib and other random hype coins , the network itself is valuable.\n\nAlso, in a hard fork, miners have to choose where to go. PoS hardforks end up with users automatically being on both chains. So in the future, if BCH increases real world adoption and therefore price rises, there's a threat that hashrate would move from BTC to BCH. PoS systems lack that competitiveness.\n\nStill the energy costs are quite high and that's a tough messaging challenge to overcome. But big blocks like BCH have much higher throughout and much less energy cost per transaction.\n\nThanks for the questions!!",

I judge BCH by how many customers use it to pay me, and how the fees are lower than all other options. At points BCH has already matched the amount of transactions of BTC. BCH has already won the p2p cash war, but soooo many people in the crypto space are looking only at \"if I buy it will the price rise and make me rich\". p2p cash people were always a tiny minority.\n2. POS is not better, it excludes so many people, and TBH isn't even crypto in my eyes.\n\nI'd rather the price go to a nice round \u00a31000 and be as stable as possible, the stability would come if there was a stupidly high amount of retail transactions per minute, and less or no speculative buys. You wouldn't just buy a load of GBP and hope the price rises against another currency. Maybe an unpopular opinion, but IMO \"investors\" bring nothing but price volatility and when we end up outnumbered by these people they distract from the main mission, which is permissionless peer to peer cash, they don't share the same dream at all.\n\nHell, most of them don't even understand the issue with the existing financial system.",

We dont have huge central banks like most countries, we don't have huge stock markets and economies that are indirectly tied to the value of currencies. Many of us peg our local currencies to the US Dollar which in itself is dangerous. So pure speculation? Yeah in the very long term I see crypto becoming the largest form of tender in the Caribbean.\n\nWhat i find appealing? It's fast and cheap and does not require the banking industry to determine who can have wealth and who can't. In St. Maarten especially, this has been the case. The banking sector has single handedly stunted the growth of my people with ridiculous 7%+ interest rates, months time to open accounts, and unilaterally closing people's bank accounts. It is my distaste for the way the banking sector has treated the people of my country that has pushed me to explore crypto.",

Anyone can research, read and look into Crypto, as they should, but when one of your leaders takes the step himself, it encourages more people to research read and look into crypto.  \n\n\nRegarding your question: Yes I have, and it was Bitcoin. To answer this, I need to give you some background on what lead me to seeking solutions for p2p transactions:  \n\n\n**Background story here:**\n\nWhen I was elected in 2017, one of my major concerns was our banking difficulties in St. Maarten, which also is the case in many latin american and caribbean countries. So I started doing my own research into Bitcoin being the most popular coin of course. I learned quickly that, at least at that time, it was not a practical solution and/or alternative to banking for my people. We needed something cheap, fast, easy. Then it got difficult. Because navigating the hundreds of options out there became difficult. \n\nMeantime the Banking in St. Maarten sucked, and still does to a great extent: Takes months to open accounts sometimes. KYC is a nightmare. On small islands EVERYONE is treated like  pep, because everyone is related to one. Transactions between banks takes days. Fees are really high. Paypal, cashapp and other things dont work here.  \n\n\nSo i shifted my focus back to banking sector reform, which has had some success:\n\n[https://sxmgovernment.com/2019/11/25/mp-brison-to-submit-consumer-banking-protection-law-this-week/](https://sxmgovernment.com/2019/11/25/mp-brison-to-submit-consumer-banking-protection-law-this-week/) \n\nthen the Motion passing the vetting of the law\n\n[https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/brison-tables-five-draft-motions-in-parliament](https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/brison-tables-five-draft-motions-in-parliament)\n\nand then most recently it started being implemented\n\n[https://www.sxm-talks.com/st-martin-news-network/brison-sees-partial-voluntary-implementation-of-the-consumer-banking-law-a-good-first-step/](https://www.sxm-talks.com/st-martin-news-network/brison-sees-partial-voluntary-implementation-of-the-consumer-banking-law-a-good-first-step/)  \n\n\nSimultaneously while working on all the above, I was researching and seeking our alternative cryptocurrency, which I believe would also put pressure on the banks to do better.\n\nIn the meantime, I learned about bitcoin cash. Since then I kept researching it, and then saw merchants on my island and other islands using it and figured I may have found a coin that works. \n\n**TL;DR on background:** banking REALLY sucks in St. Maarten, and while trying to fix that sector, I was also seeking an alternative. \n\nSo back to your question: after experimenting with Bitcoin, seeing its potential adoption on El Salvador, I knew it was not the solution on the P2P end of things. BCH fit that more which is why so many merchants are adopting it on their own.",

I'm sure you are aware of what happends to people who take a stance against the FIAT industry so please stay safe. \n\nAnd now finally my question: \n\nOut of all the different crypto currencies what made you decide to pick BCH over of another like let's say nano or any other currency?",

                    "response": "**Benefits of Bitcoin Cash for Everyone**\n\n- For the first time in human history, Bitcoin Cash allows you to be in full control of your own money. Bitcoin Cash is peer to peer money that cannot be frozen by the banks nor the government.\n\n- With Bitcoin Cash, you place your trust in the laws of Math and Cryptography rather than putting your trust in people.\n\n- Send or receive any amount of Bitcoin Cash, to anyone, anywhere, instantly and almost for free. No lengthy bank forms to fill in and no private information required from both the sender and recipient.\n\n- Whenever you are frustrated with the long queues in the bank to make a transaction, imagine how much time you had wasted, and how many millions other people are wasting their time in the bank queues every single day. Bitcoin Cash saves time and money for millions of people every single day.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash helps to connect the billions of unbanked people, with valuable talents and expertise, to the global economy, creating millions of new job opportunities and increasing economic growth for the entire world.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash enables micro transactions so you can write articles or create video contents and earn money immediately by people who like your work.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash has high volatility which could be seen as an issue or an opportunity, depending on your perspective. If something is $1 today and 20 years later, it is still $1, then there is no investment opportunity.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash protects your purchasing power from inflation and hyperinflation, similar to gold and silver, because it exists outside the banking system of fiat money.\n\n- Unlike fiat money, Bitcoin Cash cannot be counterfeited, so there is zero chance of you holding fake money.\n\n- New bank regulations with regards to bail-ins and bail-outs means the banks can confiscate depositors funds legally and anytime during a financial crisis and there is no recourse for you.\n\n- Banks can shut down and disappear along with the depositors money but Bitcoin Cash has a perfect track record of being online 24 hours a day, every single day, and had been doing so since 2009.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash payments, with CashShuffle and CashFusion, are private Internet money. This means you can send/receive money with anyone privately without having to give out your private information, useful in situations when you want to donate money to an organization without risk being implicated in the process.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is an insurance against corrupted governments. Given a long enough time, eventually a group of corrupted politicians will win the election and take control over the country to enrich themselves. Bitcoin Cash gives you the freedom to move your wealth anywhere and relocate anytime to a safer haven.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash allows you to bypass financial censorships, restrictions and sanctions because it is unstoppable peer to peer money.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today.\n\n- If you were aware of the protests currently going on in Hong Kong, India, Iran, Chile, Bolivia, and other countries, you have to wonder how a minority government could suppress and control millions of citizens.\n\nTurns out if you have an unlimited money printing machine, you could control the entire nation. You could use it to pay for the police and military to beat up the civilians. You could use it to bribe the politicians to look the other way. You could use it to pay for propaganda campaigns. You could use it to invest in companies to prevent them from speaking up.\n\nWhen you remove their unlimited money printing machine, you also reduce their ability to suppress and control the people. Suddenly, the power shifts back into the people\u2019s hands because nobody can print more Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash\u2019s supply is fixed and there will only be 21 million Bitcoin Cash forever.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is programmable money which allows for smart contracts, tokens, oracles, dividends, anonymous bearer shares, and so much new innovations that wasn\u2019t possible before. It is like the very early periods of the Internet age where it is a rapidly evolving technology and crazy amount of new innovations happen regularly and yet people barely know anything about the Internet at that point.\n\n**Benefits of Bitcoin Cash for Merchants**\n\n- Bitcoin Cash transactions are instant and safe.\n\n- Risk of chargebacks is nearly zero.\n\n- No more worries about credit card frauds.\n\n- No more worries about centralized payment systems such as PayPal freezing or stealing your money like what had happened to thousands of PayPal users.\n\n- No payment processing fee. As a merchant, you receive 100% of the amount paid to you by the customer.\n\n- Super easy to get started. Just install the Bitcoin.com Wallet and the Bitcoin Cash Register App and you can start accepting Bitcoin Cash payments within minutes.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash does not stigmatize or treat any businesses differently. If you run an organization that banks or governments may not like, you risk having your funds being confiscated anytime like what happened to the funds donated to help Hong Kong Protestors. Bitcoin Cash cannot be taken away by the banks nor the government without your permission.\n\n**How You Can Help This Peer To Peer Cash Revolution**\n\n- Spend Bitcoin Cash whenever possible. You can buy anything with Bitcoin Cash on Amazon today with up to 30% using the Purse.io service. You can pay for air tickets, hotels, food and other services using Bitcoin Cash today. Visit AcceptBitcoin.Cash or Map.Bitcoin.com to look for participating merchants today!\n\n- Pay your employees in Bitcoin Cash to help build a closed loop economy. Request to be paid in Bitcoin Cash if you\u2019re the employee.\n\n- Help educate and spread the benefits of Bitcoin Cash to family and friends, or you can just direct them to this page!\n\n- Make small donations to open source developers contributing their free time voluntarily to build applications and services for the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.\n\n- Everytime someone tries to sell you something, ask them if they accept Bitcoin Cash.\n\nSource: https://slp.1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame",

No ulterior motives to enrich its founders, ICO money grab or some slick website telling you how all these great minds are working on this latest and greatest smart contract project that you should definitely get involved in because it\u2019s about to take off! None of that, just decentralized, permission less, low fee P2P cash for everyone.\n\nNow there are some coins that come very close, but BCH has one big advantage and that is on the developer side. Since it is the real Bitcoin, most documentation, the actual white paper for example, and code written before 2017 can be used pretty much as is (e.g. RPC libraries, wallet code etc.). There\u2019s also a plethora of wallets/node implementations available for multiple operating systems/architectures. As an average developer it\u2019s the easiest way to add a decentralized low fee payment system to your project.",

Are there any coins that have the simple learning curve and ease of use that BCH does?\n\n1. Download bitcoin.com wallet\n2. Show qr code\n3. Someone scans your code\n4. Instantly, your phone dings and you have received BCH\n5. You now scan someone else's qr code and you can instantly send your newly acquired BCH. The confirmations occur in the background and for practical purposes, there is no need to worry about the confirmations. \n\nNo mempool watching, no spinning up lightning network nodes, no difficulty trying to figure out how to get your crypto off of a trapped second layer chain, no waiting hours or days for a confirmation, etc. It is all seamless and instant. It gives a feeling as if you are using PayPal without the potential control/censorship and with all the benefits of a sound money.",

Who knows how many coins he or his friends still own? I'm not touching that thing. Am I supposed to ignore its history? It even was pushed by Coinbase in dishonest ways, like when they did wash trading with it (to make it look like there was demand for it and prop up the price) and got caught and fined, or like calling it \"the oldest Bitcoin fork\", when it was never a fork, just a clone.\n\nAlso I don't think most coins can really be trusted: having to trust a single dev team makes no sense. It never made sense even in Bitcoin either, but many devs expected its development would decentralize eventually, and that's exactly what happened in the Bitcoin Cash version (Bitcoin Core version remains fully centralized on 1 implementation).",

I'd file them under \"continuous improvement, stability and usability enhancement\", something I would support in any product but is often neglected in favor of \"new features\"  (although it's debatable wether double spend proofs are a new feature or not)\n\nOn the negative side I want to say that I think it's a bit on the expensive side. (Edit: this view of mine has changed after olavs reply) I *do* know development is a lot of work (I develop for money myself), especially when done with care (to not break things and to keep the codebase tidy, documented and maintainable), which I assume you do. So please don't take this the wrong way... I have no way to tell how much work this really is to implement, just my hunch and I figured I'd let you know. In this regard: do you do estimations for each point on how much work it is and then multiply by your hourly rate or how do you arrive at the number? If you do estimate each point, it might make sense to publish the breakdown in your proposal. This could make it easier to see how things add up.",

I do development with great care, with a focus on good code architecture, WordPress coding standards, Don't repeat yourself\" (DRY), readable and maintainable code, as well as automated unit testing and manual testing. I have estimated the work required for the goals, which is how I came to the delivery estimate of 3 months. This is how I estimate the hours per goal:\n\n> For more choice and fallback when an API fails, add additional block explorer APIs blockchair.com, blockchain.info, haskoin.com, bitcore.io, and explorer.bitcoinverde.org. Additonally, support for latest version of the BitPay Insight API will be added, and any other instance of the Haskoin API or Bitcoin Verde API via custom URL.\n\n90 hours (15 hours per explorer API plus 15 hours for custom instance URL - 15x6)\n\n> Add BCH double-spend proofs for even safer zeroconf.\n\n20 hours\n\n> Add additional exchange rates API for more choice and fallback when one API fails. The APIs coinflex.com, blockchain.com, kraken.com, and gemini.com will be added.\n\n40 hours (10 hours per exchange API - 10x4)\n\n> Show CashAddr addresses for merchants in wp-admin by default with the possibility to see legacy addresses instead, when verifying HD wallet and displaying addresses in order details. This will avoid confusion by merchants who sometimes have to contact support for help, and it will improve onboarding.\n\n50 hours\n\n> Add an underpayment display in the checkout immediately when an underpayment is detected, instructing the customer to send the remainder. This will reduce support tickets to the merchants from their customers.\n\n\n20 hours\n\n> Create a simple setup wizard when activating the WordPress plugin to enable an easier setup for newer merchants to get started. We've found the huge number of configurable options to be quite daunting for users both new and experienced so we believe this is crucial in making the plugin accessible for all users. During this wizard, we will highlight Bitcoin Cash in the setup wizard as a recommended cryptocurrency for users along with wallets like[ wallet.bitcoin.com](https://wallet.bitcoin.com/) and[ coinomi.com](https://www.coinomi.com/). During this setup wizard, we will only show basic configuration options to keep it simple.\n\n\n100 hours\n\nThe total hours estimated is 320 hours. This is assuming no huge rewrites of core functionality have to happen which is why it's difficult to estimate... Testing could take anywhere from a few hours to 20+ depending on the feature. Oftentimes I spend extra time to really polish the code when I am excited.\n\nAlso note that unfortunately, the cost of living in Norway is very high, one of the highest in the world. Salaries here are also higher to compensate for the high cost of living. Companies and employees also pay a lot of taxes. The rate in this Flipstarter is not more than the average Norwegian programmer even though my skills and experience are higher than average. I have added 20% for the market volatility risks.\n\nLet me know if you have more questions and I will be happy to answer, and thanks again for your support.",

The government doesn't like that because it's a cash trade, and they can't tax it as easily, and it doesn't bolster the almighty GDP.\n\nAlso inflation is a tax on the poor, elderly and uneducated. The poor and uneducated are often the last ones to get raises that keep up with inflation. The elderly are fixed income from dwindling savings.

They would not be in the game if they did not obtain some control or influence in the market after throwing in hundreds of millions. At this point, the btc market is compromised by banks.

And any changes to it are heresy.\n\nFlash forward 40 years, and think about how terrible DOS is by today's standards. It's practically useless today. A non-graphical, 16-bit, ancient OS can't even do even simple things now. Yeah, it was able to survive for some time, the first few versions of windows even ran off of it. But eventually, it couldn't keep up, even despite everything that was built off of it, the code optimizations, etc. Despite all this, you *still* think that DOS is just the best, and are stuck in the past.\n\nThe attitude of BTC users is exactly like this DOS-lover. It has only been barely a decade at this point, and BTC is already floundering with bandaid-solutions like SegWit, LN, inflated fees, etc. DOS was still plenty usable as a daily OS after a decade, so BTC is already behind.

The only reason why a project/company would refuse is because BCH is considered a threat. They worry people might use it and start liking it better than BTC.",

Bitcoin Cash is peer to peer money that cannot be frozen by the banks nor the government.\n\n- With Bitcoin Cash, you place your trust in the laws of Math and Cryptography rather than putting your trust in people.\n\n- Send or receive any amount of Bitcoin Cash, to anyone, anywhere, instantly and almost for free. No lengthy bank forms to fill in and no private information required from both the sender and recipient.\n\n- Whenever you are frustrated with the long queues in the bank to make a transaction, imagine how much time you had wasted, and how many millions other people are wasting their time in the bank queues every single day. Bitcoin Cash saves time and money for millions of people every single day.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash helps to connect the billions of unbanked people, with valuable talents and expertise, to the global economy, creating millions of new job opportunities and increasing economic growth for the entire world.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash enables micro transactions so you can write articles or create video contents and earn money immediately by people who like your work.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash has high volatility which could be seen as an issue or an opportunity, depending on your perspective. If something is $1 today and 20 years later, it is still $1, then there is no investment opportunity.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash protects your purchasing power from inflation and hyperinflation, similar to gold and silver, because it exists outside the banking system of fiat money.\n\n- Unlike fiat money, Bitcoin Cash cannot be counterfeited, so there is zero chance of you holding fake money.\n\n- New bank regulations with regards to bail-ins and bail-outs means the banks can confiscate depositors funds legally and anytime during a financial crisis and there is no recourse for you.\n\n- Banks can shut down and disappear along with the depositors money but Bitcoin Cash has a perfect track record of being online 24 hours a day, every single day, and had been doing so since 2009.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash payments, with CashShuffle and CashFusion, are private Internet money. This means you can send/receive money with anyone privately without having to give out your private information, useful in situations when you want to donate money to an organization without risk being implicated in the process.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is an insurance against corrupted governments. Given a long enough time, eventually a group of corrupted politicians will win the election and take control over the country to enrich themselves. Bitcoin Cash gives you the freedom to move your wealth anywhere and relocate anytime to a safer haven.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash allows you to bypass financial censorships, restrictions and sanctions because it is unstoppable peer to peer money.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today.\n\n- If you were aware of the protests currently going on in Hong Kong, India, Iran, Chile, Bolivia, and other countries, you have to wonder how a minority government could suppress and control millions of citizens.\n\nTurns out if you have an unlimited money printing machine, you could control the entire nation. You could use it to pay for the police and military to beat up the civilians. You could use it to bribe the politicians to look the other way. You could use it to pay for propaganda campaigns. You could use it to invest in companies to prevent them from speaking up.\n\nWhen you remove their unlimited money printing machine, you also reduce their ability to suppress and control the people. Suddenly, the power shifts back into the people\u2019s hands because nobody can print more Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash\u2019s supply is fixed and there will only be 21 million Bitcoin Cash forever.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is programmable money which allows for smart contracts, tokens, oracles, dividends, anonymous bearer shares, and so much new innovations that wasn\u2019t possible before. It is like the very early periods of the Internet age where it is a rapidly evolving technology and crazy amount of new innovations happen regularly and yet people barely know anything about the Internet at that point.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Benefits of Bitcoin Cash for Merchants**\n\n- Bitcoin Cash transactions are instant and safe.\n\n- Risk of chargebacks is nearly zero.\n\n- No more worries about credit card frauds.\n\n- No more worries about centralized payment systems such as PayPal freezing or stealing your money like what had happened to thousands of PayPal users.\n\n- No payment processing fee. As a merchant, you receive 100% of the amount paid to you by the customer.\n\n- Super easy to get started. Just install the Bitcoin.com Wallet and the Bitcoin Cash Register App and you can start accepting Bitcoin Cash payments within minutes.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash does not stigmatize or treat any businesses differently. If you run an organization that banks or governments may not like, you risk having your funds being confiscated anytime like what happened to the funds donated to help Hong Kong Protestors. Bitcoin Cash cannot be taken away by the banks nor the government without your permission.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How You Can Help This Peer To Peer Cash Revolution**\n\n- Spend Bitcoin Cash whenever possible. You can buy anything with Bitcoin Cash on Amazon today with up to 30% using the Purse.io service. You can pay for air tickets, hotels, food and other services using Bitcoin Cash today. Visit AcceptBitcoin.Cash or Map.Bitcoin.com to look for participating merchants today!\n\n- Pay your employees in Bitcoin Cash to help build a closed loop economy. Request to be paid in Bitcoin Cash if you\u2019re the employee.\n\n- Help educate and spread the benefits of Bitcoin Cash to family and friends, or you can just direct them to this page!\n\n- Make small donations to open source developers contributing their free time voluntarily to build applications and services for the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.\n\n- Everytime someone tries to sell you something, ask them if they accept Bitcoin Cash.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSource: https://slp.1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame",

That is how the inflation protection can come about.\n\nAlso, we know that increased demand to hold, an effect of adoption, means higher coin value. Together, this makes up an interesting mix of advantages: Easy transactions, no intrusion from a third party or government in your payment, inflation protection and a high reward expectation - low risk from a savers point of view.\n\nRemember the first user (satoshi) in the beginning had no counterparty to receive payment from and the coin had no value... and the first years normal payment for goods and services was not really an option. The expectation of future uptake was therefore the only aspect, and currently it is still an important aspect if not the most important aspect. Throwing that under the bus, marketing wise, is therefore the wrong thing to do.\n\nTo da moon!",

This kind of self-sustaining adoption will ensure money is constantly flowing into BCH.\n\nFrom a developer perspective, what BCH lacks in manpower, we make up for in passion and dedication to the project. Although our protocol/network devs are great, we are frankly lacking on application and product developers. Despite that there are some very interesting projects in the works. Come hang out on Telegram to find out more :)\n\nFrom a macro perspective, the \"sound money\" and \"peer to peer cash\" use cases which are primary to BCH are becoming increasingly desirable in the current unstable geopolitical climate.\n\nFinally, very few other crypto projects are focused on that primary usecase, as you already know, since you're telling us you just dumped your LTC bags.\n\nI'm obviously biased, but overall, I think BitcoinCash is the #1 most sound investment anybody can make right now. No joke. Needless to say, I'm very bullish. ;)",

I do it myself, cash out BTC when most people are buying.\n\nMaybe an unpopular opinion, but I don't want to see the price of BCH shoot up (or down), I'd be happy to see it rise slowly and organically, but ideally I'd like to see it become very stable, which will surely happen when there are millions of retail transactions (like on the scale of Visa) and less speculative transactions.. I honestly believe speculative buys are holding us all back, at least as peer to peer cash. I just want at least one coin that is extremely suitable for merchants and peer to peer cash use, instead of turning every single coin into a ponzi scheme to line the pockets of people who don't even really like or understand crypto, peer to peer cash, and just wanting more fiat.\n\nBCH is already leading in the areas I want to see it lead in. That being said I think you made the right choice moving over, LTC works great as p2p cash now, but that won't last forever.",

It's the Bitcoin that I would have gone into if I had been fortunate enough to know how to buy before 2017 but I wasn't. BCH is the most undervalued coin with the highest real world usage and potential. It directly competes with the BTC which it is miles ahead of in everyone single way except hashrate (wich can change overnight with a push of a button since it's mined with the same equipment as BTC)\n\nI don't see any other decentralized project or currency that could compete with today's BCH. The price is being artificially kept low to discredit the coin but not that they are in %100 control otherwise it wouldn't have shot up to 1650 dollars last year. And it will happen again. My guess is it will be this year.\n\nSo congratulations on your decision!",

Who knows how many coins he or his friends still own? I'm not touching that thing. Am I supposed to ignore its history? It even was pushed by Coinbase in dishonest ways, like when they did wash trading with it (to make it look like there was demand for it and prop up the price) and got caught and fined, or like calling it \"the oldest Bitcoin fork\", when it was never a fork, just a clone.\n\nAlso I don't think most coins can really be trusted: having to trust a single dev team makes no sense. It never made sense even in Bitcoin either, but many devs expected its development would decentralize eventually, and that's exactly what happened in the Bitcoin Cash version (Bitcoin Core version remains fully centralized on 1 implementation).",

They have journalists that are literally dying to report on world events\u2014literally [shot dead](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/13/world/europe/brent-renaud-irpin.html) for trying to report the truth. And yet, [Tara Siegel Bernard](https://www.nytimes.com/by/tara-siegel-bernard), [Emily Flitter](https://nytimes.com/by/emily-flitter) and [Anupreeta Das](https://www.nytimes.com/by/anupreeta-das) wrote an [entire article](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/29/business/gamestop-stock.html) about a cult [subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) devoted to directly registering stocks without mentioning directly registering stocks.\n\nThose people are not journalists. They don't report the news. They have zero integrity, they are only there to control a narrative for a wealthy elite.\n\nYou can tell the truth more by their deliberate omissions than what they say.\n\nEDIT: \n\nThe difference between the USDT marketcap and USD marketcap of GBTC is $7.3B as of [close yesterday](https://grayscale.com/products/). So if the DCG is deep into BTC/GBTC, it's clearly not something that can be fixed by Coindesk shilling nor $100M. \n\nAlso, the SEC has deliberately and specifically only approved instruments that do *NOT* allow the dynamic flow of capital into the underlying crypto assets, i.e. only price speculative instruments can be approved, *not* investment instruments.  So NEWS FLASH, DCG [can't lead a successful grassroots campaign to get the SEC](https://news.bitcoin.com/grayscale-investments-investors-help-convince-sec-approve-bitcoin-spot-etf/) to approve something if the SEC's [existence depends on them *NOT* approving it](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/11/30/salary/).\n\nBut DCG wants price discovery in crypto as much as the SEC, and they can all go fuck themselves. \n\nBitcoin Cash is bitcoin, and bitcoin is taboo",

It's a thinly veiled polemic at every turn.\n\nIf I were to perform an analysis of the above preview article, I'd have to blow up an unsubstantiated claim or fallacy in every other paragraph.\n\nEveryone is of course welcome to your opinions on Bitcoin, but it's awfully convenient to take the bank-domesticated version of it (BTC) and criticize the flaws erected in it by those who coopted and \"tamed\" it. You will say \"but this is Bitcoin as it exists today, we have to examine this\" -- to which I say, sorry, that is not Bitcoin anymore, and I estimate at least half your points about that system are still wrong.\n\nI'll challenge one simple misconception that you put forth as central intention of Bitcoin:\n\n>  It is intended to be a proxy for all resources in the real economy, and as such, the ultimate goal is to tie everything to Bitcoin by whatever means necessary.\n\nThis would be a property of any globally usable currency.\n\nBut it should be said that Nakamoto did not make such a claim. Only that Bitcoin is supposed to be a form of electronic cash with certain properties, which were outlined against the usual properties of fiat. No claim was made that Bitcoin is superior in all aspects, but that it can provide a solution to the problem of electronic cash while reducing the required trust / intermediaries / hassles. Anyone who has actually used Bitcoin knows it could live up well to its founder's claims.\n\nThe Bitcoin community has been sullied by fiat-sponsored talking heads which beat the \"maximalist\" drum that feeds exactly the narrative you're bringing to us here (and haven't we all heard it a million times).\n\nEarly Bitcoiners weren't all so conceited to think that Bitcoin couldn't or wouldn't co-exist with other currencies. And the extensive crypto market that's developed since, clearly demonstrates the fallacy of the maximalist view.\n\nBTC was rigged to serve as a strawman, a scarecrow, in virtually every respect.\n\nIt is undignified and unserious to attempt to analyze it as \"Bitcoin\".",

Also coins get lost all the time. If we end up with only 1 bitcoin cash it could still serve the whole world, because we can add decimals as many as we wont. Infinite divisible, much better than printing out of thin air.",
