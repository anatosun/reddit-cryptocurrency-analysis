                    "response": "while we at it, I have been keeping my eye on some of the BCH addresses for more than 1 year now, one of the BCH address caught my attention as it appears to me to have very high chance to belong to Binance. I begin to track this address because it first appears to me as a exchange, when I watched the amount of BCH in that address went down every day(as sales), I expected the price of BCH to go up. At the time when that wallet went dry(from over 400,000 down to about 2000 BCH left), the price of BCH did not go up as I expected, I did not see it as a big deal as I thought it must be something else that I missed. However, about 1 or 2 days after I begin to hear people saying(as I never use Binance myself)  Binance stopped the withdrawing of BCH from their platform. I share the address here so anyone who is interested can have a look.\n\nThere are many indicators in the historical data of this wallet to support this assumption but I really don't want to write a long article about it. I believe you can easily find them if you have some professional data analysis skill. For example, another interesting spot to look at is the movement of this address during the 2021 May crash.  \n\nFor people here who is living in the US(which I am not), perhaps there is a way to bring this to the SEC to bring justice to the price of BCH. \n\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b717om4dHcDNy9LAagMj8mGW59vyXjvA3GBn\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7",

The report states that through poor market liquidity, counterparty risks, funding strains and the overexposure of financial institutions being strangled throughout the invasion, these conditions led to \u201ccryptoization,\u201d or what many Bitcoiners would refer to as hyperbitcoinization.The result of the invasion led to an influx of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies flooding into the hands of those that needed it most. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany companies have taken their own initiative to further the amount of bitcoin donations, such as Bitcoin Magazine. Ukrainian reliance on outside funding has shown the fragility of the current monetary and payments system, as bitcoin was capable of offering instantaneous relief. \n\nThe report states:\u201cCapital markets might become more fragmented, with possible implications for the role of the US dollar. And the fragmentation of payment systems could be associated with the rise of central bank digital currency blocs.\u201dNot only can payment disruptions happen with bitcoin, but the IMF is also concerned about the quantity of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) being developed. As the system fragments and central banks become even more autonomous, the current banking infrastructure is left in a deluge of exponential technological advancements cascading into a game of keep up.This fragmentation increases in severity as nation-states begin to act outside the purview of the established world order.\n\n El Salvador started an initial chain-reaction in 2021 that led to explosive growth in the Bitcoin network as it made bitcoin legal tender, but the international geo-political stage of 2022 belongs to Russia. \n\nOne primary concern listed in the report for the IMF is nation-states like Russia utilizing protocols such as Bitcoin as a way of skirting economic sanctions:\u201cOver time, sanctioned countries could also allocate more resources toward evading sanctions through mining. Mining for energy-intensive blockchains like Bitcoin can allow countries to monetize energy resources, some of which cannot be exported due to sanctions.\u201dThe IMF notes that the monthly average revenue for all bitcoin mining for last year equated to $1.4 billion. They estimate that Russian miners could have captured up to 11% of that and Iranian miners may have captured up to 3%. \n\nWhile economic sanctions may slow down the pace of the Russian ruble, bitcoin historically appreciates in an extreme manner allowing participants in the network to not only function in the crumbling financial system of the world order, but profit. \n\nThe report states:\u201cTo fend off cryptoization risks, strengthening macroeconomic policies is necessary but may not be sufficient given the unique challenges posed by the crypto ecosystem.\u201dThe IMF mentions that central bank digital currencies may stagnate some of the growth being experienced by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with the emergence of central bank digital currencies. This opinion is based on the assumption that CBDCs will function as a superior monetary network, thereby taking away some of the demand from other currencies. \n\nThe report then calls for global cooperation and precise actions from lawmakers to prevent further fragmentation of the global payments infrastructure.\n\nThe main takeaway from this report should be that Bitcoin has fragmented the world order with a superior payment network, and the old guard is nervous.",

I might not even have been involved in BCH -- he got me to participate early on along with Amaury at ABC.  \n\nHe got me to participate again and helped found BCHN when we wanted to break away from ABC.  He was a key person in all of that and I think had he not existed I would not be as involved as I have been. He was a catalyst for the right things to happen at the right time and he helped lots of people coalesce and work together.\n\nI have to thank him deeply for all his hard work and passion and for his strong moral stance on things.  He is a very honest person and a tremendously hard working and conscientious person.  He truly loves BCH.",

With that logic we should have stayed at 1MB blocks since we don't usually fill those either.\n\nThe demand is there. The reason the demand isn't finding our blockchain is because it's still unproven to scale in the real world. There I said it.\n\nWe should have already published a 256MB mainnet test block. The only reason we haven't is lack of focus. No offense to you or anyone out there. Devs tend to congregate around trendy problems to be solved, which is why we now have a derelict token system instead of a more scalable blockchain.\n\nI am here to help us regain focus. Any goal that supersedes scaling is a bad goal.\n\nThanks again for your contributions. I respect your work.",

I don\u2019t seem to get a proper answer. Plus some people were also saying that it would be okay for it to get expensive like BTC in future, for security. My question to them is: if it\u2019s a form of cash that\u2019s easily spendable, isn\u2019t it hypocritical to accept that it could be expensive to transact just like BTC.

                            "response": "> Moreover, when I asked on this subreddit, that how will BCH deal with its affordability of transactions when BCH becomes much more expensive and block rewards start to disappear. I don\u2019t seem to get a proper answer.\n\nAssuming a target of 1 transaction per person per day for 1 billion humans (between 1 and 10% adoption, or so), you would get 1 billion transactions in 24 hours. Assuming even block generation of one block every 10 minutes, we get 144 blocks per 24 hours.\n\nEach of those 144 blocks, would then contain ~7 million transactions.\n\nAssuming a block subsidy of 0 BCH/block, and a per-transaction fee of 1 US cent, each block would earn a fee of ~$70k.\n\nThat is 35x what they are currently earning, but only 1/3rd of what a BTC block is earning today.\n\nIf the adoption is higher, say 10 transactions per day, for 10 billion humans, then the per-block reward in fees alone ends up at $7,000k per block instead.\n\nIt's very speculative, and the \"dollar\" here is probably not going to be worth the same, but what would it take to get there?\n\nWell, assuming payment transactions vastly dominate the chain, and such transactions typically taking 400 bytes, it works out to 2.8gb blocks for the first case, and 280gb blocks for the later.\n\nThat scale is not feasable on todays internet, and that level of signature validation is not feasable on commodity processors today.\n\nSucks, right? Well, the block reward is not 0 yet, and 50 years ago top-modern computers were working with kilobytes of data, and CPU cycles were measured in megahertz.\n\nGiven todays commodity computers and first-world internet connections, the gigablock testnet initive (many years ago now) and later measurements have confirmed that gigabyte sized blocks are possible.\n\nIn fact, many of the node softwares are already capable of this and have proven it on testnets.",

That's it.\n\nPokket.cash is the only BCH-only wallet I know of that adheres to the \"no bullshit\" principle. Except the UI/UX leaves a bit to be desired before I'm comfortable sharing it with my non-technical friends. (No offense Pokkst but like most Bitcoin-related/FOSS software, it looks like an engineer designed it and I know from talking to you that it's very unlikely to change)\n\nOf course, instead of whining, I do intend on taking matters into my own hands, but it's time-consuming. It's unfortunate that we have such a drought of developers because there are so many things that both need to get done and would be really cool for BCH.",

Legally speaking, every single transaction is a taxable event if I understand correctly. Between two individuals and things like craigslist, Facebook marketplace etc there'd be no issue. But for a fully compliant brick and mortar merchant, I don't know why they would choose to accept crypto at all.\nThe US doesn't have nearly as big of a problem as other countries when it comes to hyperinflation, access to banks/credit cards/financial tools etc. So what's the incentive for adoption? \nEspecially when a merchant can accept cashapp and other low/no fee instant transactions.\nYou'd have to be pretty idealistic to want to deal with the headache of tax and legal compliance to accept crypto.\nMaybe south Florida can have success specifically because it is a tourist destination hotspot. So it's convenient for foreign visitors and remittances.\nAnyways, I'd love to hear more about this!",

If Bitcoin ever sees widespread adoption, only the wealthy will be able to afford L1 transactions, which are required to open and close LN channels and adjust liquidity. This effectively means the poor will be forced to establish LN channels with large centralized nodes.\n\nThese centralized nodes will ultimately become middlemen that can charge fees and surveil all traffic through them. Even though theoretically people will have the freedom to move their BTC liquidity to other channels, in reality the economics of the situation will make it impossible and people without much wealth will be stuck without a choice.\n\nIt appears to me that in their apparent quest to pursue maximum decentralization by limiting the blocksize, Bitcoiners have actually locked themselves into a solution that will guarantee centralization if it is adopted at scale. I hope this isn't actually the case and I am wrong, but I can't predict any other result given what I understand.",

The amount of confirmations is meaningless, since I have not touched these addresses in year and do not plan on utilizing them for more years. My bigger concern would be the KYC implications and/or actual ability to withdraw the coins once they have been split; since I am not interested in selling them at this moment, just splitting them.\n\n> Alternatively, you could split the bch/bsv and bch/xec using their respective spv wallets and post fork bch (dust). It doesn't really matter in which order you decide to split it first.\n\nWhile I appreciate this comment, it does not help me figure out how to do the two splits.\n\nLet me see if I can figure it out.\n\n(1) Create a new wallet using Electron Cash 4.2.7; choosing the \"Import Bitcoin Cash addresses or private keys\" option. Complete the action by providing the **Original** private key or keys. (I have already done this)\n\n(2) Create a 2nd wallet using Electron Cash 4.2.7; choosing \"Standard wallet\"; then choosing \"Create a new seed\" (I am tempted to ask about the third option, \"Use public or private keys\", but feel that would just complicate things)\n\n(3) From the wallet created in step (1), I send (all/some) to an address I obtain from wallet created in step (2).\n \nI have split the BCH from the BSV?\n\nThen I download, let's say Electrumsv? ( I have not done this)\n\n(4) Create wallet using Electrumsv, choosing (I don't know because I have not downloaded it); choosing the \"Import Bitcoin Cash addresses or private keys\" option. Complete the action by providing the **Original** private key or keys.  \n\n(5) Create a 2nd wallet using Electrumsv; choosing \"Standard wallet\"; then choosing \"Create a new seed\" (or do I even need to do this?)\n\n(6) From the wallet created in step (4), I send (all/some) to an address I obtain from wallet created in step (6).\n\nI have successfully split my BCH/BSV?\n\nThen download EC(BCHA) version of Electron Cash, let's call it \"XEC-SPV\"\n\n(7) Create wallet using XEC-SPV, choosing (I don't know because I have not downloaded it); choosing the \"Import Bitcoin Cash addresses or private keys\" option. Complete the action by providing the **Original** private key or keys. \n\n(8) Create a 2nd wallet using XEC-SPV; choosing \"Standard wallet\"; then choosing \"Create a new seed\" (or do I even need to do this?)\n\n(9) From the wallet created in step (7), I send (all/some) to an address I obtain from wallet created in step (8).\n\nI have successfully split my BCH and EC/BCHA?",

Let's just hope it isn't some centralized POS... unfortunately it looks like centrally controlled protocols will pounce and end up getting the market share.\n\nInforming people about POW and decentralized distributed blockchains is the most important thing we can do.

This would be superb if smartBCH didn't exist, but as it does, I don't see the point. It will be competing with smartBCH for liquidity, and requires SLP infrastructure to work flawlessly.

ETH's block interval is currently 14 seconds, and will be switching to 12 seconds once The Merge (transition to PoS) takes place. Substantially shorter block intervals are difficult to achieve because the BLS signature aggregation process for the ETH2/Casper PoS consensus mechanism takes a fair amount of time (due largely to network latency and speed-of-light delays), but this limitation is unrelated to transaction throughput.\n\nIf you're alleging that this article entails that BCH is somehow better than Ethereum because BCH hasn't yet hit its scaling limit, then you're missing the point -- BCH's 600-second-average random block time isn't remotely competitive with ETH2's 12 second deterministic block time, and BCH is unlikely to beat ETH on that front unless BCH switches to PoS too.\n\nBCH may have a lead in layer 1 transaction throughput, but ETH still has a lot of room to grow in both layer 1 and layer 2 transaction throughput. ETH has a disadvantage in L1 throughput due to its inefficient/heavy database structure and relative difficulty of parallelizing transaction execution in account-based models vs UTXO models, but ETH has an advantage in L2 throughput due to its Turing-complete scripting system and the amount of work that's been invested in L2 infrastructure already.",

The rest is eaten by various fees.\n\nThere are various problems with Ethereum layer 2 approach\n\n- lack of a universal stanard\n\n- being abused by pump and dumpters that start tribal wars between the various L2 approaches.\n\n- L2's not being compatible with one another.\n\n- Some L2's are just plain unsafe and can get rugged by the team at any time\n\n- When the bear market comes and L1 fees go down again, there won't be an incentive to move liquidity away from L1. and there won't be much funding going to L2 devs. People will say: we don't need L2 anymore, fees are low on L1!\n\n\nAnd so the current Ethereum L2 approach is a big complex mess that is only solved by something like Avax or smartBCH.  \n\nHowever before everybody figures this out we are 15 years in the future ....\n\nThe next 2 cycles you will see ETH dominace grow and BTC dominance srhink but more and more ETH dapps will move to Avax and smartBCH and eventually Avax and smartBCH will become much more usefull. If part of the stock market ever moves to crypto, they will move to smartBCH and avax, not Ethereum.\n\nEthereum has enough momentum to overtake BTC after which all BTC maxis will become ETH maxis.\n\nBut it wont enjoy that top status for very log before Ethereum itself starts falling.\n\nThe first couple of implementations of new technology never make it.

                    "response": "Those are good points. In addition, I would like to add some other points as well.\n\n**Benefits of Bitcoin Cash for Everyone**\n\n- For the first time in human history, Bitcoin Cash allows you to be in full control of your own money. Bitcoin Cash is peer to peer money that cannot be frozen by the banks nor the government.\n\n- With Bitcoin Cash, you place your trust in the laws of Math and Cryptography rather than putting your trust in people.\n\n- Send or receive any amount of Bitcoin Cash, to anyone, anywhere, instantly and almost for free. No lengthy bank forms to fill in and no private information required from both the sender and recipient.\n\n- Whenever you are frustrated with the long queues in the bank to make a transaction, imagine how much time you had wasted, and how many millions other people are wasting their time in the bank queues every single day. Bitcoin Cash saves time and money for millions of people every single day.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash helps to connect the billions of unbanked people, with valuable talents and expertise, to the global economy, creating millions of new job opportunities and increasing economic growth for the entire world.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash enables micro transactions so you can write articles or create video contents and earn money immediately by people who like your work.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash has high volatility which could be seen as an issue or an opportunity, depending on your perspective. If something is $1 today and 20 years later, it is still $1, then there is no investment opportunity.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash protects your purchasing power from inflation and hyperinflation, similar to gold and silver, because it exists outside the banking system of fiat money.\n\n- Unlike fiat money, Bitcoin Cash cannot be counterfeited, so there is zero chance of you holding fake money.\n\n- New bank regulations with regards to bail-ins and bail-outs means the banks can confiscate depositors funds legally and anytime during a financial crisis and there is no recourse for you.\n\n- Banks can shut down and disappear along with the depositors money but Bitcoin Cash has a perfect track record of being online 24 hours a day, every single day, and had been doing so since 2009.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash payments, with CashShuffle and CashFusion, are private Internet money. This means you can send/receive money with anyone privately without having to give out your private information, useful in situations when you want to donate money to an organization without risk being implicated in the process.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is an insurance against corrupted governments. Given a long enough time, eventually a group of corrupted politicians will win the election and take control over the country to enrich themselves. Bitcoin Cash gives you the freedom to move your wealth anywhere and relocate anytime to a safer haven.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash allows you to bypass financial censorships, restrictions and sanctions because it is unstoppable peer to peer money.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today.\n\n- If you were aware of the protests currently going on in Hong Kong, India, Iran, Chile, Bolivia, and other countries, you have to wonder how a minority government could suppress and control millions of citizens.\n\nTurns out if you have an unlimited money printing machine, you could control the entire nation. You could use it to pay for the police and military to beat up the civilians. You could use it to bribe the politicians to look the other way. You could use it to pay for propaganda campaigns. You could use it to invest in companies to prevent them from speaking up.\n\nWhen you remove their unlimited money printing machine, you also reduce their ability to suppress and control the people. Suddenly, the power shifts back into the people\u2019s hands because nobody can print more Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash\u2019s supply is fixed and there will only be 21 million Bitcoin Cash forever.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is programmable money which allows for smart contracts, tokens, oracles, dividends, anonymous bearer shares, and so much new innovations that wasn\u2019t possible before. It is like the very early periods of the Internet age where it is a rapidly evolving technology and crazy amount of new innovations happen regularly and yet people barely know anything about the Internet at that point.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Benefits of Bitcoin Cash for Merchants**\n\n- Bitcoin Cash transactions are instant and safe.\n\n- Risk of chargebacks is nearly zero.\n\n- No more worries about credit card frauds.\n\n- No more worries about centralized payment systems such as PayPal freezing or stealing your money like what had happened to thousands of PayPal users.\n\n- No payment processing fee. As a merchant, you receive 100% of the amount paid to you by the customer.\n\n- Super easy to get started. Just install the Bitcoin.com Wallet and the Bitcoin Cash Register App and you can start accepting Bitcoin Cash payments within minutes.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash does not stigmatize or treat any businesses differently. If you run an organization that banks or governments may not like, you risk having your funds being confiscated anytime like what happened to the funds donated to help Hong Kong Protestors. Bitcoin Cash cannot be taken away by the banks nor the government without your permission.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How You Can Help This Peer To Peer Cash Revolution**\n\n- Spend Bitcoin Cash whenever possible. You can buy anything with Bitcoin Cash on Amazon today with up to 30% using the Purse.io service. You can pay for air tickets, hotels, food and other services using Bitcoin Cash today. Visit AcceptBitcoin.Cash or Map.Bitcoin.com to look for participating merchants today!\n\n- Pay your employees in Bitcoin Cash to help build a closed loop economy. Request to be paid in Bitcoin Cash if you\u2019re the employee.\n\n- Help educate and spread the benefits of Bitcoin Cash to family and friends, or you can just direct them to this page!\n\n- Make small donations to open source developers contributing their free time voluntarily to build applications and services for the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.\n\n- Everytime someone tries to sell you something, ask them if they accept Bitcoin Cash.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSource: https://slp.1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame",

A lot of persons living in the territory of Ukraine today don't like what NATO and its financial backers have done to their country over the last 10-15 years and find themselves aligning ideologically more with Russians.  Many of those people were born in the Soviet Union.  So the recent news about Ukraine, as delivered to redditors, is mostly propaganda and outright lies being told because someone wants war.  All that said yes I think Bitcoin Cash is a very good option.",

Has a huge network effect and lots of devs and investment.\n\nSmartBCH:  Ethereum, if it was linked to Bitcoin (BCH), and only 6 months old.  You can swap BCH <> smartBCH, so it's the same 21 million coins.  Supports the EVM, therefore all code and projects from Ethereum can be copied across, but it lacks users and liquidity because it is new.  However, because it is new, it was developed without a lot of technical debt and a clean slate, and is up to 80x more scaleable than Ethereum - and that will probably increase.  Unlike Ethereum, it is backed by Bitcoin miners (instead of upcoming Proof of stake), which has some pros (it adds to the scaleability just mentioned, among other things) and some cons (environmental complaints from doubters), but largely pros since the Bitcoin miners are already mining BTC/BCH anyway.\n\nSolana: Relatively newer chain.  I don't know the tech much, maybe someone else can explain, but it is essentially very centralised - it has had numerous occassions, including recently, where the entire chain is down and/or the devs have to make sudden manual fixes.  By being centralised, it promises to support much higher throughput, although the issues with that approach are coming to the surface as I mentioned.  Has a lot of hype among very new crypto investors, and probably huge amounts of VC coins which will unlock and flood the market at some point.\n\nThat's my best attempt.\n\nhttps://bitcoincashpodcast.com/faqs/BCH/what-is-smart-bch\n\nhttps://bitcoincashpodcast.com/faqs/Cryptocurrency/what-about-ethereum-eth\n\nhttps://bitcoincashpodcast.com/start#episode-9-of-10-ethereum-dogecoin-tether-and-more",

There needs to be some incentives for new users. Newer chains do this with premined coins. For smartBCH, maybe a flipstarter campaign is needed.\n\nPeople here are focused on BCH-smarBCH bridge but most DeFi users aren't BCH holders. We need a bridge to port any ETH ERC20 to smartBCH. All stablecoins must be supported otherwise bridges like multichain.org, celer.network or synapseprotocol.com won't work and new users can't come without CEX.",

Do we know their names? Are they reliable? Can we trust them? \n\nFor an overview of L2 solutions see https://l2beat.com/\n\nIt's a complex mess and I personally have tried loopring for a year and it sucked. It's just a AMM and order book exchange that is cheaper then uniswap and sushiswap but only has about 100 million dollars worth of liquidity outside of LRC- ETH trading.\n\nYou can cash in direcly cause they are working with a payment provider but the only way to cash out is first to move back to L1.\n\nSo, thats a lot of smart  contract interaction.\n\nAnd then you still have to send the ETH to a cex to sell it.\n\nSo you might as well trade all the ERC20 tokens on a cex to begin with .....\n\nLet's say you are trading or providing liquidity on loopring and you want to cash out your gains every day.\n\nIs that feasable? No because ever day you would have to pay L1 smart contract fees to cash out.\n\nWhile on smartBCH i just use hop.cash to a cex where I can sell for CAD. I can do this everyday for less then 10 cents worth of fees.\n\n\nSo ...... I doubt that the current ETH approach towards scaling will work very well.\n\nAnd as soon we the next bear market comes and L1 fees drop down again then people will forget about L2 again. Nobody will care about providing liquidity on a L2 or moving to a L2 because then you just have access to less dapps. \n\nTill another bull comes around, fees go up ... etc etc.\n\nBut really all it does is conditions people to NOT use Ethereum or ERC20 but just buy them on an exchange and never touch the actual network.\n\nThis means the liquidity of sushiswap and uniswap is going to go down. Liquidity on avax and smartBCH will keep going up. \n\nEventually an equilibrium will be found and Ethereum will never have fees go up anymore because it will have lost a  good 30% of it's investors and users and never get them back .",

It has a huge userbase you want to tap into. Helps if big Ethereum projects buy into the network (ex. Uniswap just deployed to Polygon, after a near unanimous DAO vote)\n1. The blockchain's foundation org gives you a big grant and promises to advertise your project to their users\n1. The blockchain is well integrated with other big sources of liquidity / contracts, i.e. bridge to Ethereum\n\nI have been a developer for flowerpatch.app for a few years. Don't underestimate the need for grants and haggling. I've seen stuff like Avax competing with Polygon to give small projects 6 figure grants, to try to pull them in. They also provide developer support, free resources, and marketing. They go and do backroom deals with OpenSea. They pull media stunts, like doing a Gitcoin matching round for developers",

You have to do something in the real world using real resources which is hard and competitive. PoS doesn't have to touch the real world at all which is why all the new coins and new projects are using PoS because you don't have to make a big investment in tangible items that cost money and have a robust network to start. I think most people in crypto are here to get rich quick and the way to do that is by creating a brand new coin and hype it up, so people pre mine it, give themselves a lot, and make it PoS so it's easy to hit the ground running. How many new PoW coins get created? Btc BCH doge Monero - what else is there? Tbh I don't understand it fully but the fact that it's such a hard thing to replicate, the network itself has value because it's harder to build. Which is why I even think doge might have a future compared to shib and other random hype coins , the network itself is valuable.\n\nAlso, in a hard fork, miners have to choose where to go. PoS hardforks end up with users automatically being on both chains. So in the future, if BCH increases real world adoption and therefore price rises, there's a threat that hashrate would move from BTC to BCH. PoS systems lack that competitiveness.\n\nStill the energy costs are quite high and that's a tough messaging challenge to overcome. But big blocks like BCH have much higher throughout and much less energy cost per transaction.\n\nThanks for the questions!!",

I got mine at 11 dollars.  The price manipulation and the cencorship makes it looks like there are 10 million people out there all holding some Bitcoin. In reality the number of people that keep their BCH under their own control is much higher then the number of people that keep their BTC under their own control. In fact it's almost a given that if somebody controls his own BCH, they also have a stack of BTC .... cause then if the manipulators want to pump we still gain. \n\nSo this market is not what it looks like. And it will play itself out. Then nobody knows what comes after. The first 51\n% attempts on BCH? We will have to wait and see. \n\nWe should all be happy that the manipulators have given the public more then 4 years now to independenly figure out where the real value is and slowly stack up on more and more BCH.\n\nThere are clubs on the internet with hunderds of people all trying to get 1 BCH. CLubs with five hunderd people all trying to get 21 BCH. Etc etc. \n\nYou don't hear much about them because we understand it's in our favor to let the manipulators play their game and we just wait.\n\nWe learned how to benefit personally from the games of the manipulator. And for most of us the price of BCH is pretty irrelevant. As long as there is enough hash to keep the network going, which is currently not a problem.\n\n\nYou have to understand we want to get FREE first and rich later because becoming rich without free is pointless.

I judge BCH by how many customers use it to pay me, and how the fees are lower than all other options. At points BCH has already matched the amount of transactions of BTC. BCH has already won the p2p cash war, but soooo many people in the crypto space are looking only at \"if I buy it will the price rise and make me rich\". p2p cash people were always a tiny minority.\n2. POS is not better, it excludes so many people, and TBH isn't even crypto in my eyes.\n\nI'd rather the price go to a nice round \u00a31000 and be as stable as possible, the stability would come if there was a stupidly high amount of retail transactions per minute, and less or no speculative buys. You wouldn't just buy a load of GBP and hope the price rises against another currency. Maybe an unpopular opinion, but IMO \"investors\" bring nothing but price volatility and when we end up outnumbered by these people they distract from the main mission, which is permissionless peer to peer cash, they don't share the same dream at all.\n\nHell, most of them don't even understand the issue with the existing financial system.",

Personally I have very little interest in it, even though I love crypto in general. All I ever wanted was a payment system with no third parties, no rules, no chance for chargebacks etc..\n\nPeople who actually wanted p2p cash were and probably always will be a minority.\n\nIf the masses were not interested before, why would they be interested now, probably less chance of it now as all people think about crypto is getting rich and \"wen lambo\".\n\nNot to mention the aggressive and constant propaganda towards BCH in the main subs.\n\nMy goal would be to stop accepting fiat all together, but I feel that will never happen in my life time, without shooting myself in the foot financially. When Bitcoin was crippled it set this mission back years, Microsoft, Steam, Stripe and many others forced to stop accepting it.

                    "response": "I think PoS is a great idea. It's a far superior consensus system. Three major advantages:\n\n1. Lower power consumption.\n\n2. Lower inflation/fees. Proof of work punishes bad actors (i.e. miners who try to reorg the chain) by making their spent electricity forfeit for malfeasance. Proof of stake punishes bad actors by making their deposited and staked money forfeit for malfeasance. Because PoW requires that miners constantly spend electricity and reimburses them for that with the block subsidy and fees, PoW requires a large amount of new coins either be created or redirected from users to miners. With PoS, validators have near-zero costs and risks and can be convinced to stake with much weaker incentives.\n\n3. Deterministic block intervals and higher throughput. PoW creates blocks at random intervals following a Poisson distribution. This means that there is a non-zero chance that two blocks will be found by different miners within e.g. 1 second of each other, or a shorter time than it takes for a block to propagate from one miner to the others. This causes an orphan race in which one of the two blocks will fail to be incorporated into the blockchain, causing that PoW to go unrewarded. Since large miners or pools are more likely to win an orphan race, the existence of orphaned blocks encourages miners to centralize by joining large pools. The bigger the blocks are, the slower they are to propagate, and the higher the orphan rate. This places a limit on the safe throughput capacity for a blockchain. In contrast, PoS blocks are created at a deterministic rate, not a random interval. Because the intervals are deterministic, orphan races will only happen in the case of misconfigured or overloaded systems, which solves the issue almost completely. PoS blocks can have a very short average interval (e.g. 10 seconds) with high transaction throughput while still keeping a lower orphan rate than a 600-second PoW blockchain.\n\nOne big disadvantage:\n\n1. PoS does not solve the problem of providing a fair coin issuance mechanism for newly minted coins, but PoW does. A blockchain that uses PoS for consensus should either have nearly all of its coins already be issued, or should have a parallel minting and allocation system for new coins. As the Bitcoin family of coins have already issued the vast majority of their coins, this issue is less relevant for BCH than it would be for other newer currencies.",

They voted to only reward POW miners 10%, originally was 40%.  Conveniently, the Higher percentage of DCR you had staked, the more votes you got in proposal.  So, Yeah, they voted to increase their own staking rewards, lol.\nWith so many projects, POS is feeling more and more like a scam way of doing things.  Pre-issue tokens, distribute most of them to founders/backers/buddies, only release like 40% of the supply, make it to where you need millions to run a validator (many openly or probably covertly ran by the Team)\u2026.Then, create some false narrative and stack rewards for doing nothing, not even using the blockchain.\nI don\u2019t like the environmental impact of POW, but I be damned if POS doesn\u2019t look like a complete racket the way many teams are doing it.",

                    "response": "It comes from demand to hold. How many people, and how much value each of them want to hold in that money type.\n\nIt does not mean hold forever, it can be from seconds to generations. It depends on each individual's situation and preferences.\n\nTransactions, or use in trade, does not mean anything directly for the value. The important thing is that you can easily get rid of your money when you want - how liquid the money is.\n\nHodling means you want to have a considerable fraction of your total money holding in bitcoin (BTC, BCH), always rebalance your holdings when practical circumstances change those balances. Since the liquidity is not the best for BCH, compared to fiat money, given that you will need fiat money in the near future, you always need to have some fiat money. All shops basically want to buy your fiat money.\n\nSo if you plan to buy a big item, like a car, you have to, in advance, rebalance your money types so you have the fiat necessary. After that trade, you have to consider how much money you have left in total, which type you want to hold, and rebalance.\n\nAll money types (including dollars and local fiat) have value only because you believe that it will keep the value, or at least some of it, in the future. That is obvious, because they are not real, you have to sell the money to get what you need. The only purpose of having money, any type, is to sell in the future.\n\nNow, what is the future for your local fiat? The dollar? Bitcoin Cash? You have to make an opinion. \n\nFor me, it is easy based on my knowlegde, all fiat money are guaranteed to go down in value, that is inherent in how the central banks and the governments function. BCH on the other hand, can increase in value. That I like, I don't want to buy something to show off, spend my monthly salary the same day I get it. So I have most of my money in BCH, just a small amount in local fiat and dollar.\n\n\nWhy can BTC and BCH increase in value? Because people will find out eventually that their money loses value to the tune of 15% a year. First they will spend on big ticket items, because they figure out that they will at least get something for it. But luxury cars for instance is not good money, and not stable. Argentinians experience that in their most recent hyperinflation. Not too many people wanted those cars, and they don't last forever. So they will turn to sound money crypto, meaning the demand goes up, the available amount does not go up at all, the people who want to sell will not increase enough to satisfy the new demand, and the coin price goes up. \n\nIn the end it will stabilize, but not completely, we can still get increase in the value of money in the form of real stuff slowly going down in value, due to productivity increase and other factors.\n\nNone of this will happen unless the money type is spread throughout the world, to almost everybody. Therefore we need the easy use, the speed, the safety, in addition to the soundness. That also means more transactions, but the main thing is that they want to own.",

We dont have huge central banks like most countries, we don't have huge stock markets and economies that are indirectly tied to the value of currencies. Many of us peg our local currencies to the US Dollar which in itself is dangerous. So pure speculation? Yeah in the very long term I see crypto becoming the largest form of tender in the Caribbean.\n\nWhat i find appealing? It's fast and cheap and does not require the banking industry to determine who can have wealth and who can't. In St. Maarten especially, this has been the case. The banking sector has single handedly stunted the growth of my people with ridiculous 7%+ interest rates, months time to open accounts, and unilaterally closing people's bank accounts. It is my distaste for the way the banking sector has treated the people of my country that has pushed me to explore crypto.",

Anyone can research, read and look into Crypto, as they should, but when one of your leaders takes the step himself, it encourages more people to research read and look into crypto.  \n\n\nRegarding your question: Yes I have, and it was Bitcoin. To answer this, I need to give you some background on what lead me to seeking solutions for p2p transactions:  \n\n\n**Background story here:**\n\nWhen I was elected in 2017, one of my major concerns was our banking difficulties in St. Maarten, which also is the case in many latin american and caribbean countries. So I started doing my own research into Bitcoin being the most popular coin of course. I learned quickly that, at least at that time, it was not a practical solution and/or alternative to banking for my people. We needed something cheap, fast, easy. Then it got difficult. Because navigating the hundreds of options out there became difficult. \n\nMeantime the Banking in St. Maarten sucked, and still does to a great extent: Takes months to open accounts sometimes. KYC is a nightmare. On small islands EVERYONE is treated like  pep, because everyone is related to one. Transactions between banks takes days. Fees are really high. Paypal, cashapp and other things dont work here.  \n\n\nSo i shifted my focus back to banking sector reform, which has had some success:\n\n[https://sxmgovernment.com/2019/11/25/mp-brison-to-submit-consumer-banking-protection-law-this-week/](https://sxmgovernment.com/2019/11/25/mp-brison-to-submit-consumer-banking-protection-law-this-week/) \n\nthen the Motion passing the vetting of the law\n\n[https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/brison-tables-five-draft-motions-in-parliament](https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/brison-tables-five-draft-motions-in-parliament)\n\nand then most recently it started being implemented\n\n[https://www.sxm-talks.com/st-martin-news-network/brison-sees-partial-voluntary-implementation-of-the-consumer-banking-law-a-good-first-step/](https://www.sxm-talks.com/st-martin-news-network/brison-sees-partial-voluntary-implementation-of-the-consumer-banking-law-a-good-first-step/)  \n\n\nSimultaneously while working on all the above, I was researching and seeking our alternative cryptocurrency, which I believe would also put pressure on the banks to do better.\n\nIn the meantime, I learned about bitcoin cash. Since then I kept researching it, and then saw merchants on my island and other islands using it and figured I may have found a coin that works. \n\n**TL;DR on background:** banking REALLY sucks in St. Maarten, and while trying to fix that sector, I was also seeking an alternative. \n\nSo back to your question: after experimenting with Bitcoin, seeing its potential adoption on El Salvador, I knew it was not the solution on the P2P end of things. BCH fit that more which is why so many merchants are adopting it on their own.",

I suspect its a manual moderator using their subreddit \"rules\" to hide their censorship.",

                    "response": "**Benefits of Bitcoin Cash for Everyone**\n\n- For the first time in human history, Bitcoin Cash allows you to be in full control of your own money. Bitcoin Cash is peer to peer money that cannot be frozen by the banks nor the government.\n\n- With Bitcoin Cash, you place your trust in the laws of Math and Cryptography rather than putting your trust in people.\n\n- Send or receive any amount of Bitcoin Cash, to anyone, anywhere, instantly and almost for free. No lengthy bank forms to fill in and no private information required from both the sender and recipient.\n\n- Whenever you are frustrated with the long queues in the bank to make a transaction, imagine how much time you had wasted, and how many millions other people are wasting their time in the bank queues every single day. Bitcoin Cash saves time and money for millions of people every single day.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash helps to connect the billions of unbanked people, with valuable talents and expertise, to the global economy, creating millions of new job opportunities and increasing economic growth for the entire world.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash enables micro transactions so you can write articles or create video contents and earn money immediately by people who like your work.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash has high volatility which could be seen as an issue or an opportunity, depending on your perspective. If something is $1 today and 20 years later, it is still $1, then there is no investment opportunity.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash protects your purchasing power from inflation and hyperinflation, similar to gold and silver, because it exists outside the banking system of fiat money.\n\n- Unlike fiat money, Bitcoin Cash cannot be counterfeited, so there is zero chance of you holding fake money.\n\n- New bank regulations with regards to bail-ins and bail-outs means the banks can confiscate depositors funds legally and anytime during a financial crisis and there is no recourse for you.\n\n- Banks can shut down and disappear along with the depositors money but Bitcoin Cash has a perfect track record of being online 24 hours a day, every single day, and had been doing so since 2009.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash payments, with CashShuffle and CashFusion, are private Internet money. This means you can send/receive money with anyone privately without having to give out your private information, useful in situations when you want to donate money to an organization without risk being implicated in the process.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is an insurance against corrupted governments. Given a long enough time, eventually a group of corrupted politicians will win the election and take control over the country to enrich themselves. Bitcoin Cash gives you the freedom to move your wealth anywhere and relocate anytime to a safer haven.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash allows you to bypass financial censorships, restrictions and sanctions because it is unstoppable peer to peer money.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today.\n\n- If you were aware of the protests currently going on in Hong Kong, India, Iran, Chile, Bolivia, and other countries, you have to wonder how a minority government could suppress and control millions of citizens.\n\nTurns out if you have an unlimited money printing machine, you could control the entire nation. You could use it to pay for the police and military to beat up the civilians. You could use it to bribe the politicians to look the other way. You could use it to pay for propaganda campaigns. You could use it to invest in companies to prevent them from speaking up.\n\nWhen you remove their unlimited money printing machine, you also reduce their ability to suppress and control the people. Suddenly, the power shifts back into the people\u2019s hands because nobody can print more Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash\u2019s supply is fixed and there will only be 21 million Bitcoin Cash forever.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash is programmable money which allows for smart contracts, tokens, oracles, dividends, anonymous bearer shares, and so much new innovations that wasn\u2019t possible before. It is like the very early periods of the Internet age where it is a rapidly evolving technology and crazy amount of new innovations happen regularly and yet people barely know anything about the Internet at that point.\n\n**Benefits of Bitcoin Cash for Merchants**\n\n- Bitcoin Cash transactions are instant and safe.\n\n- Risk of chargebacks is nearly zero.\n\n- No more worries about credit card frauds.\n\n- No more worries about centralized payment systems such as PayPal freezing or stealing your money like what had happened to thousands of PayPal users.\n\n- No payment processing fee. As a merchant, you receive 100% of the amount paid to you by the customer.\n\n- Super easy to get started. Just install the Bitcoin.com Wallet and the Bitcoin Cash Register App and you can start accepting Bitcoin Cash payments within minutes.\n\n- Bitcoin Cash does not stigmatize or treat any businesses differently. If you run an organization that banks or governments may not like, you risk having your funds being confiscated anytime like what happened to the funds donated to help Hong Kong Protestors. Bitcoin Cash cannot be taken away by the banks nor the government without your permission.\n\n**How You Can Help This Peer To Peer Cash Revolution**\n\n- Spend Bitcoin Cash whenever possible. You can buy anything with Bitcoin Cash on Amazon today with up to 30% using the Purse.io service. You can pay for air tickets, hotels, food and other services using Bitcoin Cash today. Visit AcceptBitcoin.Cash or Map.Bitcoin.com to look for participating merchants today!\n\n- Pay your employees in Bitcoin Cash to help build a closed loop economy. Request to be paid in Bitcoin Cash if you\u2019re the employee.\n\n- Help educate and spread the benefits of Bitcoin Cash to family and friends, or you can just direct them to this page!\n\n- Make small donations to open source developers contributing their free time voluntarily to build applications and services for the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.\n\n- Everytime someone tries to sell you something, ask them if they accept Bitcoin Cash.\n\nSource: https://slp.1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame",

No ulterior motives to enrich its founders, ICO money grab or some slick website telling you how all these great minds are working on this latest and greatest smart contract project that you should definitely get involved in because it\u2019s about to take off! None of that, just decentralized, permission less, low fee P2P cash for everyone.\n\nNow there are some coins that come very close, but BCH has one big advantage and that is on the developer side. Since it is the real Bitcoin, most documentation, the actual white paper for example, and code written before 2017 can be used pretty much as is (e.g. RPC libraries, wallet code etc.). There\u2019s also a plethora of wallets/node implementations available for multiple operating systems/architectures. As an average developer it\u2019s the easiest way to add a decentralized low fee payment system to your project.",

Are there any coins that have the simple learning curve and ease of use that BCH does?\n\n1. Download bitcoin.com wallet\n2. Show qr code\n3. Someone scans your code\n4. Instantly, your phone dings and you have received BCH\n5. You now scan someone else's qr code and you can instantly send your newly acquired BCH. The confirmations occur in the background and for practical purposes, there is no need to worry about the confirmations. \n\nNo mempool watching, no spinning up lightning network nodes, no difficulty trying to figure out how to get your crypto off of a trapped second layer chain, no waiting hours or days for a confirmation, etc. It is all seamless and instant. It gives a feeling as if you are using PayPal without the potential control/censorship and with all the benefits of a sound money.",

We then did extensive research to understand the project's underlying technology, the problem it is designed to solve, and what is its target industry. We also looked at value and performance metrics for each currency. We believe the market capitalization of a currency is a key indicator of its current value, and the projects that the currency is working on, and its target industry can hint towards its utility and sustainability in the future.",

It's BTC Jr. \"The silver to Bitcoin's gold\" lol.\n\nIf your scaling model looks like \"you lock your digital gold, ahem, *silver* in a channel\" then the coin is ultimately intended as a store of value not a currency.\n\nThat said LTC is the closest thing to being a decentralized digital currency besides BCH and it's in about the same boat.",

It isn't the long term intended use of the coin. Ethereum is no different. People used it for cash too. But it's not built to do that and sure enough in no time flat it stopped working.\n\nI think it's wrong to say the thing is A if the intended use is B, just because it happens to also do A under some circumstances. Ultimately, the \"vision\" for LTC is just like BTC: always-full blocks, \"fee pressure,\" and LN.\n\nIn fact the more I think about it the more annoyed it makes me. Not personally at you of course. But it's no different from bitcoin dot org calling BTC an \"innovative payment system\" with \"fast peer to peer transactions\" and \"low processing fees.\" BTC is *still* calling itself cash even though that hasn't been it's intended usage since 2017.\n\nSo, with all due respect, no. I have to agree to disagree here. LTC may currently work as cash. However the goal is not to be cash. So it isn't cash.",

But LTC has worked as peer to peer cash from day one and is the second best coin in 2022 IMO. I don't really like the direction it is going in, and know that it would end up just  like BTC if the price went up and the network was extremely busy, but that isn't happening right now.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned it's p2p cash until people stop paying me with it.\n\nI don't even understand how you can call a coin like this a scam TBH. Nobody is scamming anybody, how even could they with a proof of work coin like this??\n\nI feel saying this is as crazy as saying Bitcoin Cash is a scam.",

If I remember correctly there was something similar to a pre-mine going on in the early days of LTC, officially I think they brushed it off as a bug in the difficulty algorithm. Charlie Lee then got Coinbase (his employer) to list LTC and left that job shortly afterwards to \u201cwork\u201d (I.e. pump & dump) LTC. \n\nAll the while he was riding the \u201cLTC is the silver to bitcoin\u2019s gold\u201d wave and being fully embraced by Bitcoin Core enthousiasts, yet BCH is accused of stealing the Bitcoin name and being a scam?\n\nWith BCH there is no pre-mining or money grabbing ulterior motives.

Who knows how many coins he or his friends still own? I'm not touching that thing. Am I supposed to ignore its history? It even was pushed by Coinbase in dishonest ways, like when they did wash trading with it (to make it look like there was demand for it and prop up the price) and got caught and fined, or like calling it \"the oldest Bitcoin fork\", when it was never a fork, just a clone.\n\nAlso I don't think most coins can really be trusted: having to trust a single dev team makes no sense. It never made sense even in Bitcoin either, but many devs expected its development would decentralize eventually, and that's exactly what happened in the Bitcoin Cash version (Bitcoin Core version remains fully centralized on 1 implementation).",

It's a thinly veiled polemic at every turn.\n\nIf I were to perform an analysis of the above preview article, I'd have to blow up an unsubstantiated claim or fallacy in every other paragraph.\n\nEveryone is of course welcome to your opinions on Bitcoin, but it's awfully convenient to take the bank-domesticated version of it (BTC) and criticize the flaws erected in it by those who coopted and \"tamed\" it. You will say \"but this is Bitcoin as it exists today, we have to examine this\" -- to which I say, sorry, that is not Bitcoin anymore, and I estimate at least half your points about that system are still wrong.\n\nI'll challenge one simple misconception that you put forth as central intention of Bitcoin:\n\n>  It is intended to be a proxy for all resources in the real economy, and as such, the ultimate goal is to tie everything to Bitcoin by whatever means necessary.\n\nThis would be a property of any globally usable currency.\n\nBut it should be said that Nakamoto did not make such a claim. Only that Bitcoin is supposed to be a form of electronic cash with certain properties, which were outlined against the usual properties of fiat. No claim was made that Bitcoin is superior in all aspects, but that it can provide a solution to the problem of electronic cash while reducing the required trust / intermediaries / hassles. Anyone who has actually used Bitcoin knows it could live up well to its founder's claims.\n\nThe Bitcoin community has been sullied by fiat-sponsored talking heads which beat the \"maximalist\" drum that feeds exactly the narrative you're bringing to us here (and haven't we all heard it a million times).\n\nEarly Bitcoiners weren't all so conceited to think that Bitcoin couldn't or wouldn't co-exist with other currencies. And the extensive crypto market that's developed since, clearly demonstrates the fallacy of the maximalist view.\n\nBTC was rigged to serve as a strawman, a scarecrow, in virtually every respect.\n\nIt is undignified and unserious to attempt to analyze it as \"Bitcoin\".",

While I agree there is centralization of control structures, I think you are misinterpreting the role of POW miners.  The inherent competition in POW mining results in continuous reinvestment of capital. Miners don\u2019t need the price of Bitcoin to rise un-abated forever, they need to mine Bitcoin more efficiently than their competition. They need to plan their operations to be resilient enough to survive volatility and changing world energy landscapes and various geo-political landscapes. The holders/hoarders may be motivated by an ever increasing price, and many miners may be holders. But I think you are severely discounting the power and function the underlying technology/idea/concept of Bitcoin. My ability to interact with the network in a decentralized manner, and the game theory that keeps miners in honest cooperative competition to uphold the decentralized function of the network is more important than the underlying economic policy and whatever shortcomings that policy had to yield a more even or \u2018fair\u2019 distribution.",

If we can generate enough consumer and merchant demand that we're regularly filling up 4mb blocks then it would be a no brainer to fast track scalability upgrades. But as of now, there's still not enough people who want to use it. \n\nI think we're on the right track. I think concentrated adoption in a few localized areas is the right approach. But with how little on chain activity there actually is right now, what does scaling do for us?",

I'm probably wrong on some points, please correct me if I got something wrong but: \n\nThe answer is that the limiting factor to big blocks is node optimization and global bandwidth.\n\nThe great firewall of China is currently the biggest impediment to raising the blocksize to a gigabyte, not actually the software. Basically if you lose too many packets, then the chance of a network desync goes up, and well, that's bad.\n\nSo if you're processing a gigabyte every ten minutes, you have to send a gigabyte to the whole network every ten minutes. Thanks to external controls (not technical limitations) that's not possible in and out of China with enough consistency to responsibly allow for it. So it's likely you'd get one version of the network IN china, where the chinese miners are, and another version of the network with all the miners who are OUT of China. Who's the real blockchain? (answer:  yours, of course).\n\nThere's some stuff above my pay grade that can be done to mitigate this issue, and of course China's prominence as a mining hub is currently on the wane, but the fact remains.\n\nIt's likely the mainnet would be just fine with (mostly full) 256MB blocks right now, but since we're not filling up the 32MB blocks, it's not at the top of people's to-do lists.",

I suspect that players can buy/sell in-game items with other players using BCH. The game takes maybe a 20% cut of such transactions and I assume that's how the games would try to make money.\n\nSo if a player has lots of time, he can play everyday and find rare loots to sell to other players who has BCH but lack time to play the games. That's my opinion but until the games are ready, I don't have the full details.\n\nAnd of course, these are 4 different games, the one I mentioned may only be applicable to the RPG and not the strategy based games. The games are about 80% done and so there may still be much changes prior to launch.",

It almost sounds like there will be a separate in game currency, but when players buy and sell goods on the marketplace, they can sell to each other with BCH. From the way you're describing, it seems like how some MMOs have in game currency and premium currency that can be used for special items. And in this game the premium currency is BCH. So maybe the devs might choose to sell premium items like in game skins for BCH and choose to take a cut of that transaction or have a fee, Instead of buying the skin directly from the game and then keeping all of it. Something like that?",

I'd file them under \"continuous improvement, stability and usability enhancement\", something I would support in any product but is often neglected in favor of \"new features\"  (although it's debatable wether double spend proofs are a new feature or not)\n\nOn the negative side I want to say that I think it's a bit on the expensive side. (Edit: this view of mine has changed after olavs reply) I *do* know development is a lot of work (I develop for money myself), especially when done with care (to not break things and to keep the codebase tidy, documented and maintainable), which I assume you do. So please don't take this the wrong way... I have no way to tell how much work this really is to implement, just my hunch and I figured I'd let you know. In this regard: do you do estimations for each point on how much work it is and then multiply by your hourly rate or how do you arrive at the number? If you do estimate each point, it might make sense to publish the breakdown in your proposal. This could make it easier to see how things add up.",

I do development with great care, with a focus on good code architecture, WordPress coding standards, Don't repeat yourself\" (DRY), readable and maintainable code, as well as automated unit testing and manual testing. I have estimated the work required for the goals, which is how I came to the delivery estimate of 3 months. This is how I estimate the hours per goal:\n\n> For more choice and fallback when an API fails, add additional block explorer APIs blockchair.com, blockchain.info, haskoin.com, bitcore.io, and explorer.bitcoinverde.org. Additonally, support for latest version of the BitPay Insight API will be added, and any other instance of the Haskoin API or Bitcoin Verde API via custom URL.\n\n90 hours (15 hours per explorer API plus 15 hours for custom instance URL - 15x6)\n\n> Add BCH double-spend proofs for even safer zeroconf.\n\n20 hours\n\n> Add additional exchange rates API for more choice and fallback when one API fails. The APIs coinflex.com, blockchain.com, kraken.com, and gemini.com will be added.\n\n40 hours (10 hours per exchange API - 10x4)\n\n> Show CashAddr addresses for merchants in wp-admin by default with the possibility to see legacy addresses instead, when verifying HD wallet and displaying addresses in order details. This will avoid confusion by merchants who sometimes have to contact support for help, and it will improve onboarding.\n\n50 hours\n\n> Add an underpayment display in the checkout immediately when an underpayment is detected, instructing the customer to send the remainder. This will reduce support tickets to the merchants from their customers.\n\n\n20 hours\n\n> Create a simple setup wizard when activating the WordPress plugin to enable an easier setup for newer merchants to get started. We've found the huge number of configurable options to be quite daunting for users both new and experienced so we believe this is crucial in making the plugin accessible for all users. During this wizard, we will highlight Bitcoin Cash in the setup wizard as a recommended cryptocurrency for users along with wallets like[ wallet.bitcoin.com](https://wallet.bitcoin.com/) and[ coinomi.com](https://www.coinomi.com/). During this setup wizard, we will only show basic configuration options to keep it simple.\n\n\n100 hours\n\nThe total hours estimated is 320 hours. This is assuming no huge rewrites of core functionality have to happen which is why it's difficult to estimate... Testing could take anywhere from a few hours to 20+ depending on the feature. Oftentimes I spend extra time to really polish the code when I am excited.\n\nAlso note that unfortunately, the cost of living in Norway is very high, one of the highest in the world. Salaries here are also higher to compensate for the high cost of living. Companies and employees also pay a lot of taxes. The rate in this Flipstarter is not more than the average Norwegian programmer even though my skills and experience are higher than average. I have added 20% for the market volatility risks.\n\nLet me know if you have more questions and I will be happy to answer, and thanks again for your support.",

CryptoWoo was something he worked on originally before picking the brand up which means a lot of the codebase for these changes take a lot of time as it's rewriting core functionality and not to mention Olav keeps everything to the PHP coding standards. He frequently speaks to me just to just break down his steps to recreate the issue, etc...  This goes on for hours sometimes... (12+)\n\nA good chunk of the work involved is also testing. During each release, he tests several versions of PHP, with x CryptoWoo addons installed, etc. No stone is usually left unturned when he does test. I'm sure he can give you a good idea of the breakdown of development time he estimates for each new feature. \n\nI hope this helps a bit just to give you a small insight while we wait for Olav to wake up haha.",

I've been thinking of trying this out myself for a while now, and still will when I get some spare time, but honestly what puts me off of this is having to install wordpress, then woocommerce, then this plugin.. I guess my main issue is building a site on top of wordpress and not a stand-alone store script for example PrestaShop or any of the similar alternatives. Admittedly I'm still yet to try WooCommerce, but I suspect it doesn't have as many features as some more longer running professional webstore scripts.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong but will have to try it out myself to see.\n\nI wonder if you will ever make plugins for things like IPS Commerce, PrestaShop etc..??\n\nI have a similar solution for PrestaShop, but not IPS Commerce (this is a shop addon for IPS forum/community suite), but looking at the features on CryptoWoo, it has surpassed the features on my current solution by far now, assuming I buy the xPUB plugin as well.\n\nI will at least try it on a simple project, but might switch some existing stores to this system, depending on how I find the WP/WC/CW install. \n\nTL;DR: plugins for other platforms would be cool",

The WordPress plugin directory has over 55,000 plugins so there is a huge selection and many possibilities to customize the store or optionally do custom development and only the imagination is the limit.\n\nI think you will like WooCommerce. If you need help to get started then I would be more than happy to have Mark install WordPress, WooCommerce and the CryptoWoo plugin on your site for you if that helps?\n\nYes, we are considering making plugins for other ecommerce platforms in the future but we would probably go with the ones most used first, so for example next one would be Shopify most likely.",

I'm no *greeny*, but if you want to save the environment then a deflationary currency can do more for it than any windmill or solar panel. You end up with real durable, competitive products that last and maintain a resale value.\n\nBut this leads to a barter economy, with a growing second-hand marketplace. The government doesn't like that because it's a cash trade, and they can't tax it as easily, and it doesn't bolster the almighty GDP.\n\nAlso inflation is a tax on the poor, elderly and uneducated. The poor and uneducated are often the last ones to get raises that keep up with inflation. The elderly are fixed income from dwindling savings. I believe the current combination of low interest rates and high inflation are deliberate money policy to drain value from the Boomers as an alternative to death taxes.",

Anyone that has been around and has at least a bit of logical skills knows that blockstream hijacked btc.\n\nDo you remember when banks did not want to touch crypto back when people were getting their bank accounts closed for associating with it?  NOW the past year or so financial institutions have nose dived right into the market. They would not be in the game if they did not obtain some control or influence in the market after throwing in hundreds of millions. At this point, the btc market is compromised by banks. They started accumulating btc and with the help of whales and the media pumping FUD, they took advantage of market manipulation to accumulate a good portion btc when noobs sell of. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThere have been some questionable events the last two years. the tether/bitfinex debacle and the two recent \"dips\" were noticeably pegged to the US Stock Market. like what? that is has never happened nor is NOT supposed to.   Dont get me started on capital gains tax. ffs the one of the reasons why we have cyrpto stems from the '08 financial \"crises\" where the govt/banks/housing market screwed the nation/world over with shaddy loans and bailouts. \n\nIts clear at this point the bitcoin project has been compromised. kinda funny how this \"war\" has exposed the exact need for crypto with Russia getting kicked off the swift payment system. talk about a blown opportunity for crypto. \n\nI believe in BCH, in fact i use every chance i get as my prefered method of transactions for goods. its easy, its fast and its everything satoshi has ment for btc to be. i just wish somewhere down the road we focused more on adoption more (in the west) than treating it like a get quick rich scheme. trust me, no \"retail investor\" is getting rich off of bitcoin. \n\nThe institutions have taken control of bitcoin and they will never relinquish that power with the bazillions they have invested in it.",

It doesn't affect the economy. Reminder; apart from the USA and EU, everyone still trades with Russia. Yes, that includes China, India, countries like Iran, brazil etc.\n\nSure, there is fear. People start taking out cash from the ATMs ($1B in the first 2 days), but it looks very unlikely that banks will topple due to this. Just like the price of BCH we can see that after the initial fear comes hope for change and the norm will resume and charts will actually turn upwards.\n\nThe article with the clickbait title \"The damage is done\" is just western publicity and just like the hundreds of pictures that were based on video-games or stills from movies or just old media, they are not actually about this week. They are just making it up to look like their side is winning. Keeping the illusion until the last moment.",

Are you affiliated?\n\n> What is the ideal way to proceed?\n\nThe simplest way is for the school to set up some crypto wallets and just provide some receiving addresses which you could publish in your campaign. If the school has some online resources, they could publish those addresses there too.\n\nYour part would then be to publicize the fundraising campaign, and people could donate whatever amounts they want just by sending funds to the crypto addresses.\n\nAnother poster has cautioned against fraud in this thread - I suppose it depends on whether the school has to comply with some regulations around fundraising. Not sure, you would need to check that out.\n\n> Can Bitcoin Cash donations help achieve this goal?\n\nAbsolutely. It would be very easy.\n\n> If so, What is the process of validating the wallet address intended for donation?\n\nThe people in charge at the school should set up a wallet to which only they have the keys / seed, and provide a receiving address generated by that wallet.\n\nTo prove that they control the address, they can provide a signed message using the receiving address.\nThis is quite easy in e.g. [Electron Cash](https://electroncash.org) wallet.\n\nMany other organizations just publish the receiving address on their official site, then people know it is legit.\n\nSome people have suggested Flipstarter.\nThat can be useful if you are looking to raise a certain amount in a specific period, instead of an open-ended donation address.\nThe difference is, if the full amount is not achieved, then the campaign fails and no money is collected.",

He told the business associate that he didn't have \"much of a choice\" in the matter.\n\n>After the explosion in Navalny's bitcoin donations, the FSB started exploring how to identify his crypto donors, according to the person familiar with the matter. The FSB, the person said, instructed Rosfin to find a way to achieve that goal. Responding to questions from Reuters, Rosfin said it is prohibited from disclosing measures to combat terrorist financing. It said Navalny was involved in \"terrorist activity.\"\n\n>In April 2021, a Russian non-profit organisation called the Digital Economy Development Fund invited Binance to a private meeting with Rosfin at a government building in Moscow, according to the invitation seen by Reuters. The organisation is headed by a former top advisor to Putin on internet policy, German Klimenko, and was set up in 2019 to develop Russian technologies. The fund's website says one of its partners is the Russian trade and industry ministry. Kostarev, the Binance director, chairs the fund's committee on digital currencies.\n\n[Navalny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexei_Navalny#:~:text=On%2020%20August%202020%2C%20Russian,was%20hospitalized%20in%20serious%20condition.)\n\n>On 20 August 2020, Russian opposition figure and anti-corruption activist\u00a0Alexei Navalny\u00a0was poisoned with a\u00a0Novichok\u00a0nerve agent\u00a0and was hospitalized in serious condition.\u00a0",

Here are the details:\n\nthe open streetmap concepts require that you map based on the physical location. Its a map after all.\n\nSo when a company that takes 30% from an order allows you to pay with crypto on their website FOR a restaurant that is nice. But when you go to that restaurant and at the location you can't pay with crypto, then that is not useful.  \n\nPeople need to be able to count on the OSM data being correct. If I go and have a holiday in Kiel and expect to be able to pay everything with BCH because OSM said so, I would be very sad that 50 restaurants have been tagged where I can't actually pay with BCH.\n\nPlease check the wiki for why details on tagging, you can find the page here; https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency\n\ncc /u/simon-v",

I regret that i haven't heard of it earlier, so that i could have been grateful sooner.\n\nIt was a cooperative effort, the OSM community is awesome :-)\n \n> Would there be any combination of tags to describe that a certain currency is accepted at a certain location by proxy of a certain organization?\n\nThe point isn't so much the 'proxy' part. The point is that if you walk into the restaurant and want to check if you can pay with BCH, you will be told you can't. That is when you should not tag it as such.\n\nSee it like this; you should not advertise that you can pay with BCH at Amazon. Because you confuse people that just go to Amazon. Instead they would have to go to purse.io or similar.\n\nSo the point is about verifiability. Can a stranger walk up to the tagged location and come to the same conclusion as you did about being able to pay with BCH at that location.\n\nWhile in both these cases you can pay with BCH if you know the trick. Go to a specific website and order there and pay there instead of directly. But that is not the normal way of doing things, not verifiable.\n\nHaving to order from a 3rd party company (not advertised at location) doesn't quality. (Especially when you realize you need to KYC with Bitpay ;-)\n\n> Wouldn't disallowing this sort of arrangement also rule out some commonly used payment processors, such as BitPay or GoCrypto?\n\nThe payment processor can have a contract with the seller at the location, typically to have some payment hardware there (gocrypto does that). At which point a person being at a certain location will be able to ask staff about Crypto / BCH and pay with the staff. And that is verifiable, which is the basic requirement of OSM.\n\n > Edit: Could you, please, provide a brief summary of affected nodes (count, region)? I'd like to have something on hand when explaining the issue to my peers.\n\nThis is just Germany and really just about 5 cities. Basically all the high numbers on where2 cash in cities in Germany. (Kiel, Bremen, Lubeck, Oldenburg, Paderborn). A lot of places still likely have the not-verified `currency:BCH=yes` tag, I hope that on-the-ground checks can fix those.\n\nPersonally I ask anyone tagging to be very careful. This is not a \"numbers go up\" kind of things, this is an adoption-by-exepriencing thing. Try some locations and notice the tagging is wrong, you lose all credibility in the map, so correctness is more important than some global unverified number going up. A verified number going up is tons more useful than just creating another useless copy of maps,bitcoin,com.",

Unfortunately maybe 5% of people involved in the space understand this today. \n\nLook at home ownership.  How do you actually \u201cown\u201d the home.  It\u2019s because The State has established laws allowing records to show that you can use that place and stuff to your liking. Where NFTs come in is allowing to own something by replacing the structure the state previously organized. \n\nThe only part missing is the enforcement.  The State can enforce their organization. Right now there is nothing reinforcing NFTs. Ideally coercion will be strictly incentive based but I am watching for the fiat signs of digital enforcement.

To prevent more disclosure, even of mundane matters like the name of its chief investment officer, Tether has gone to court to block public-records requests about its business.\n\n\n>Tether\u2019s attorneys argued in court filings that additional disclosure of its reserve investments would harm its competitive position in the market and that revealing its chief investment officer\u2019s name would \u201cconstitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u201d\n\n\n>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission found last year that Tether only held equivalent dollar reserves in its accounts on a little more than a quarter of the days during a roughly two-year period, leading Tether to reach a $41 million settlement with the regulatory agency. Tether neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing\u00a0as part of its settlement with the CFTC.\n\n\n>One short seller also sees trouble in Tether\u2019s holdings of money-market funds and Treasury bills. That firm learned that an affiliate of Deltec Bank & Trust Ltd., a Bahamian bank where Tether does business, sought to invest billions of dollars in outside hedge funds that invest in highly liquid securities, people familiar with the matter said.\u00a0\n\nWhat if Deltec invested in hedge funds takung bets of tether shorts? That would be sub-prime 2.0.",

This is true.\n\nBut it doesn't stop anything else from continuing. Proving the value of BCH to skeptics like me is good, but the world is at a tipping point for all crypto-currencies to show their utility.\n\nI think if you convince crypto skeptics like myself that it's OK for BCH to exist as a PoW coin, then it excuses every other PoW crypto too because they can sell their utility based on what we accept for BCH.\n\nThe existence of this BCH community proves my point: BTC was overwhelmingly chosen by the establishment, but BCH is still growing through grassroots movements and feels an entitlement to continue existing.\n\nBut, there's also BSV, Litecoin, all the other forks here right now which won't go away. And don't forget the mountain of investors in other mining schemes.\n\nEven if other cryptocurrencies don't have as much utility as BCH, they will feel a right to exist based on a similar assertion of value. \n\nI very much support a ban on PoW mining like what was attempted in the EU. I don't think there should be a future for PoW coins without a moratorium on mining. We won't come to a sustainable conclusion unless investor interests are cut out of the conversation, like Chris Larsen.\n\nBut even then I don't know how you judge which cryptos are suitable. My only criteria is sustainability, and while it's nice that Larsen is making a stink about it, I have zero confidence in globalist governments sorting this out. \n\nAnd that's why I post here. :)",

Ist it sufficient for the exchange to ask the user to say the transfer is from his own wallet?",

We have **paid addons** for HD wallet functionality and ethereum and erc20 tokens. The paid addons bring in some income but not enough for me to develop at the speed I want to.\n\nIt was made several years ago by its previous owner, who handed the project over to me last year. The previous owner did not have a focus on BCH but I do.\n\nThe goals are listed in the Flipstarter, and you can see the break down of the work required here: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/tcmuc9/-/i0hgqng\n\nThese goals will improve user acquisition and lead to more sales of the paid addons with the growth in users, and with continued growth in wordpress plugin directory, and the last features I plan to add in the third flipstarter such as SideShift and Woocommerce marketplace listing will bring in affitional income sources and growth in sales.\n\nI expect that after the third flipstarter we will be self sufficient and have enough incomes to not need to rely on fundraisers anymore.",

I'd file them under \"continuous improvement, stability and usability enhancement\", something I would support in any product but is often neglected in favor of \"new features\"  (although it's debatable wether double spend proofs are a new feature or not)\n\nOn the negative side I want to say that I think it's a bit on the expensive side. (Edit: this view of mine has changed after olavs reply) I *do* know development is a lot of work (I develop for money myself), especially when done with care (to not break things and to keep the codebase tidy, documented and maintainable), which I assume you do. So please don't take this the wrong way... I have no way to tell how much work this really is to implement, just my hunch and I figured I'd let you know. In this regard: do you do estimations for each point on how much work it is and then multiply by your hourly rate or how do you arrive at the number? If you do estimate each point, it might make sense to publish the breakdown in your proposal. This could make it easier to see how things add up.",

I do development with great care, with a focus on good code architecture, WordPress coding standards, Don't repeat yourself\" (DRY), readable and maintainable code, as well as automated unit testing and manual testing. I have estimated the work required for the goals, which is how I came to the delivery estimate of 3 months. This is how I estimate the hours per goal:\n\n> For more choice and fallback when an API fails, add additional block explorer APIs blockchair.com, blockchain.info, haskoin.com, bitcore.io, and explorer.bitcoinverde.org. Additonally, support for latest version of the BitPay Insight API will be added, and any other instance of the Haskoin API or Bitcoin Verde API via custom URL.\n\n90 hours (15 hours per explorer API plus 15 hours for custom instance URL - 15x6)\n\n> Add BCH double-spend proofs for even safer zeroconf.\n\n20 hours\n\n> Add additional exchange rates API for more choice and fallback when one API fails. The APIs coinflex.com, blockchain.com, kraken.com, and gemini.com will be added.\n\n40 hours (10 hours per exchange API - 10x4)\n\n> Show CashAddr addresses for merchants in wp-admin by default with the possibility to see legacy addresses instead, when verifying HD wallet and displaying addresses in order details. This will avoid confusion by merchants who sometimes have to contact support for help, and it will improve onboarding.\n\n50 hours\n\n> Add an underpayment display in the checkout immediately when an underpayment is detected, instructing the customer to send the remainder. This will reduce support tickets to the merchants from their customers.\n\n\n20 hours\n\n> Create a simple setup wizard when activating the WordPress plugin to enable an easier setup for newer merchants to get started. We've found the huge number of configurable options to be quite daunting for users both new and experienced so we believe this is crucial in making the plugin accessible for all users. During this wizard, we will highlight Bitcoin Cash in the setup wizard as a recommended cryptocurrency for users along with wallets like[ wallet.bitcoin.com](https://wallet.bitcoin.com/) and[ coinomi.com](https://www.coinomi.com/). During this setup wizard, we will only show basic configuration options to keep it simple.\n\n\n100 hours\n\nThe total hours estimated is 320 hours. This is assuming no huge rewrites of core functionality have to happen which is why it's difficult to estimate... Testing could take anywhere from a few hours to 20+ depending on the feature. Oftentimes I spend extra time to really polish the code when I am excited.\n\nAlso note that unfortunately, the cost of living in Norway is very high, one of the highest in the world. Salaries here are also higher to compensate for the high cost of living. Companies and employees also pay a lot of taxes. The rate in this Flipstarter is not more than the average Norwegian programmer even though my skills and experience are higher than average. I have added 20% for the market volatility risks.\n\nLet me know if you have more questions and I will be happy to answer, and thanks again for your support.",

CryptoWoo was something he worked on originally before picking the brand up which means a lot of the codebase for these changes take a lot of time as it's rewriting core functionality and not to mention Olav keeps everything to the PHP coding standards. He frequently speaks to me just to just break down his steps to recreate the issue, etc...  This goes on for hours sometimes... (12+)\n\nA good chunk of the work involved is also testing. During each release, he tests several versions of PHP, with x CryptoWoo addons installed, etc. No stone is usually left unturned when he does test. I'm sure he can give you a good idea of the breakdown of development time he estimates for each new feature. \n\nI hope this helps a bit just to give you a small insight while we wait for Olav to wake up haha.",

I've been thinking of trying this out myself for a while now, and still will when I get some spare time, but honestly what puts me off of this is having to install wordpress, then woocommerce, then this plugin.. I guess my main issue is building a site on top of wordpress and not a stand-alone store script for example PrestaShop or any of the similar alternatives. Admittedly I'm still yet to try WooCommerce, but I suspect it doesn't have as many features as some more longer running professional webstore scripts.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong but will have to try it out myself to see.\n\nI wonder if you will ever make plugins for things like IPS Commerce, PrestaShop etc..??\n\nI have a similar solution for PrestaShop, but not IPS Commerce (this is a shop addon for IPS forum/community suite), but looking at the features on CryptoWoo, it has surpassed the features on my current solution by far now, assuming I buy the xPUB plugin as well.\n\nI will at least try it on a simple project, but might switch some existing stores to this system, depending on how I find the WP/WC/CW install. \n\nTL;DR: plugins for other platforms would be cool",

He's continually praising El Salvador and talking about moving there. I'm actually really curious to see how that goes for a hardcore maxi like him.\n\nMaybe chivo will make the experience so bad it's hard to hide. Or maybe he will be shielded from that by using a different wallet. Maybe chivo will work well enough that 80% of businesses can tolerate it and he can just avoid the 20% who hate it.\n\nDefinitely interested to see.\n\nEven more interesting will be seeing if real world examples start popping up where people are burned by fractional reserves.",

You don't need fractional reserves if you don't actually have to pay out all the BTC at once. If you only pay it out as people gradually claim it, then you can keep paying it out as long as you have BTC income coming in to cover the claims.\n\nI still have some question marks over their implementation, but you have satisfied me that they can do this in principle without fractional reserves. I'm sorry if you've been unfairly downvoted in this sub. I own no BTC, but I don't bear the BTC camp any ill will. I think you've made a valid point here and have upvoted accordingly ;)",

In that regards LTC can be regarded as quicker than BTC since it has shorter block time.\n\nHowever, LTC is kinda pointless. Reducing block time from 10 to 2.5 mins has negligible implication for \"INSTANT\" transactions (i.e whats required for Point of Sales system).\n\nBCH has \"instant\" transaction because it makes sure 0-Conf transactions (ie on broadcasts) are economically safe.\n\nThere was a rare time where it took like 3 hours to find a block on BCH, however, it doesn't impact merchants at all. Most users don't even notice.  However, if you were depositing to exchange during that period you'll be pissed since exchange requires at least 2-Conf. Those rare cases of 3 hours block time also applies to BTC so its not like BCH is disadvantaged.\n\nThe key difference between BCH and BTC is feasibility of 0-Conf.  (0-Conf is what the bankers hate. It means bitcoin can be used as cash to replace Fiat). 0-Conf is achievable via a bigger block.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo test out the user experience of BCH: Grab yourself some BCH and put it in a non-custodial wallet like the [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) wallet or Electron Cash or Pokket. Then head over to:\n\n[blockchain.poker](https://blockchain.poker)\n\n[satoshidice.com](https://satoshidice.com)\n\n[bch.games](https://bch.games)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext try the \"Bitcoin Cash Register\" App. \n\nThen try sending small amount of BCH as shareable Links.",

You need network effect to have a currency.\n\nThe history of LTC is it was the first non-joke BTC clone that had somewhat of a purpose. GPU miners pumped it during the crypto rally of 2013. (I'm not claiming that purpose was anything good.) It became well-known for that reason. Later, in around 2017, BTC leaders started promoting it as part of their propaganda against BCH. Also, many of them had large amounts of LTC from their GPU mining days. \"You want more on-chain capacity? Use LTC! Don't use BCH, it's a scam that stole our name!\" ... Neglecting to mention that BTC isn't and can't be trademarked because Satoshi is anonymous.\n\nLTC has a very small community of true fans. Regardless of price, BCH has a much larger community.\n\nMost people in the crypto community have heard \"LTC good, BCH bad,\" so they'll parrot that, but they are not truly emotionally invested in LTC, it's just a (dishonest) way to dismiss BCH.",

However LTC has chosen Lightning Network for its future scaling so we need to compare LN to BCH for usability, here BCH trounces Lightning Network which is simply a hot mess of bad usability all round.\n\n> 2) Faster or slower?\n\nBCH has doublespend proofs for \"retail-safe\" transactions in a few seconds\n\nHowever, LTC *confirms* transactions on average 4x faster than BCH.\n\n*However...* BCH has much larger blocks and much higher capacity, and can therefore scale to many more users.\n\n> 3) More secure? \n\nLTC is mined by GPU miners and BCH is mined by SAH256 ASIC miners.  I'd say it's mostly a wash in that regard.\n\n> Reliable? Has it been hacked or attacked?\n\nBoth are very reliable.  There are claims that BCH was \"attacked\" one time, but the claim is completely specious, since the \"attack\" involved recovering lost funds and returning them to their rightful owners.  There have been no other \"attacks\" on BCH.\n\n>  4) exchange listings or adoptions?\n\nHere's where things get interesting.  I'm not even sure why anyone holds LTC at this point.  LTC development has basically been dead for years, they simply port BTC changes to their blockchain (segwit, lightning, etc) and hardly anyone uses it.  BCH transfers **20 TIMES MORE** onchain value every day than LTC ([proof](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/sentinusd-ltc-bch.html#3y))\n\n> 5) any big name backer like Roger Ver with Bitcoin Cash?\n\nYes, LTC was the creation of Charlie Lee, who famously scammed all LTC holders by insisting that LTC was a great investment [while wearing a shirt that said \"HODL\", meanwhile he was dumping his entire stash](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9zegun/friendly_reminder_that_the_litecoin_36_founder/).

The app/dapp is NOT in itself a wallet, and instead makes callouts to an independent wallet\n2. It does not require a verification for every single spend.\n\nFrom [How Spend Tokens work in SIGNUP DApp wallet](https://read.cash/@SIGNUP/how-spend-tokens-work-in-signup-dapp-wallet-3c718777)\n\n> The practice of sharing the private key with every application that user is using is very risky and not sustainable. Not that your money can be stolen, many times in apps like social networks, your wallet is considered your identity as well. Sharing the same identity with different apps is similar to using the same password on every website your register!\n>\n> Other solutions to tackle this issue, require users to approve every transaction manually through a separate application or browser extension. It is slow and provides a bad user experience. Developers like to control the whole flow of user interactions on their website. Imagine a Facebook timeline that for every \"Like\" you have to wait for a window to open and approve it. It's not innovative!\n\nI agree with most of the points above. I also found it interesting that there was a representation of the allowance that an app could use:\n\n> Spend Tokens are cryptographically signed tokens that Signup wallet generates and send it to the web application. The application can use the Spend Token to perform arbitrary transactions on the user's wallet within the defined boundaries allowed by the user. Those boundaries are maximum amount allowed, and an expiration which token would be useless afterwards.\n\nI bet the Bitcoin.com wallet, pokket, ElectronCash and others would be able to implement this too.\n\n> It is also using the internet standard of JWT which is a battle tested internet standard. This token structure is quite common for web developers unfamiliar with crypto as well. Web developers use this token to establish a temporary authorized session with a server. In SIGNUP, JWTs are generated in your browser and are not signed by a centralized server.\n\nI believe JWT can be used in mobile apps as well.",

Then it stopped working altogether, presumably because Electron Cash needed to be upgraded, but the EC upgrade no longer worked on my system, and no other wallet supports CF. This is when I realised that I was an idiot for relying on something with such low usage and thin support for something as important to me as privacy, and switched to Monero for the private stuff. Life is so much easier now: never regretted it and never looked back. I went from fusing 24/7 to fusing never, waiting never, *and* having better privacy. It will be hard to get me 'fusing' again.",

Since one was more popular, it got to keep the name, Bitcoin (BTC). The other branch was less popular, and had to change the name to Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is not split *out* from Bitcoin (BTC). In the first years, the chain was the same. The newness of BCH is just the name, the two branches have the same age.\n\nSince the chainsplit in 2017, both branches have made changes. BTC added segwit, and BCH increased the blocksize. Both have also made smaller changes.\n\nIn practice, more interest for Bitcoin (BTC), only increases fees, there is actually not room\nfor more users. This includes non-custodial Lightning, because each non-custodial Lightning user\nmust also be an on-chain BTC user.\n\nYou can hope for a change in BTC, an extension of the block size,\nwhich is always a possibility, but that already happened with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and all\nlargblockers left the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem. A possible new change of blocksize in BTC will produce a new \nchainsplit in BTC, more contentious than the previous and would be a disaster for both new branches\nof that chain.\n\nBTC can still increase in value due to some users being replaced with larger, institutional users,\nthose users are weak hands.\n\nThe reason for the low price in BCH, is that the market did not think it was viable. Helped by propaganda, lies, and harassment of the BCH friendly businesses and news outlets.\n\nFor a new user, the actual price does not mean much, it is only your expectation of the future price relative to the current. Which coin will increase in percent from now is relevant. The mooning depends on new users coming in, each\nhaving a small or large cash balance.",

Like I said, BitPay used to, and I'd like to hear from merchants using them & Coinbase whether they still have the option to enable 0-conf payment acceptance. And what sort of provisions or options are in place to make that safer for merchants.\n\nPayment processors which use a payment protocol can already constrain the kinds of transactions they will accept to further protect themselves.\n\nI assume this is done by bricks&mortar payment providers like https://GoCrypto.com  // ElliePOS . They are not making customers stand around for a block confirmation.\n\nIf it works in the real world, there's NO reason it cannot work in e-commerce, and I believe we have examples to prove it, they are just not advertised well enough.",

But we mostly do not call this process of one-time exchange of fiat for crypto a trade. One-time exchange of fiat for crypto is a buy.\n\n> I want to buy crypto with my fiat money deposited in an exchange platform. This is considered 'buying' or 'trading'?\n\nThis is considered buying for you. Exchange may have different opinion, because they see it as you traded your fiat for crypto.\n\n\n> Also if the CEX says trading is not available at your region you can still buy, store and withdraw crypto? \n\nNo, I do not think so.  See above.\n\n>Is transfer the same as withdraw? \n\nNo, it is not the same. Withdraw means that you are using some service and depend on them to prepare the transaction for you, to transfer your funds somewhere else.\n\n>swapping is not the same as buying but sounds same as trading\n\nSwapping is trading, you exchange (swap) one crypto for another. Term swapping is mostly used when trading crypto on decentralized exchanges.",

Everything else you can derive from it, albeit with a lot of frustration since there are so many formats of the derived data, and derivation mechanics you can use.\n\nFor simplicity, I would recommend storing the xPriv if you are using a modern HD wallet - or storing both your seed words, the derivation mechanic (BIP39/44) and derivation properties (path).\n\nStoring just your seed words is not a good option, as the wallet you use might update and change the derivation path they use, they might get taken down or get removed, and whatever wallet you turn to in order to access your funds later would not automatically know how to go from your seed words to your actual keys.",

Fees are not relative to the amount you send, but to the computational complexity of your transaction (just an approximation). Coinbase paid the transactions fees for you, possibly.

The utxo-based cryptocurrencies should be cheaper, but BTC has pivoted away from bitcoin's whitepaper in 2017. \n\nThere are a number of \"Ethereum-killers\" around, because of Eth's inherent high fees. None has yet proven to be overall better than Eth.\n\nOn the other side, the fees on BTC are high and unpredictable *artificially and on purpose*. This is why OGs are sticking with BCH.

You're not paying it, Coinbase does.\n\nIf network fees are taken as a percentage of the transaction total, how is it possible for them to be higher than the amount you are trying to send? (Commensurately, if they are represented how is it possible to have the same fee to send X and 10X).\n\nThat's because network fees aren't taken as a percentage, but as how big your transaction actually is. A transaction fee is usually the number of bytes used times the default number of fees that allows you to get in fast. I don't know the exact formula, BCH doesn't exactly let me think of paying more than 2 sats/byte since the blocks are big to have constant 1 sat/byte.\n\n>I \"tested\" - only by setting up, not transferring - some other wallets like Electrum, and on the face of it the fees appear to be noticeably lower. Is there some reason why Exodus is more expensive? Are they scamming people?\n\nNot really, wallets are just built differently.\n\n>Is there are some better way to make transfers that I am unaware of?\n\nWell, you can stick with custodial wallets, aka the wallets where you don't need to memorize or access a seed phrase/private key, or you could move to another chain.\n\n>How much do the speeds really matter - is paying for anything above normal meaningful, or just a way for your wallet to get money off of you?\n\nThe speed's important if you want to use it as a form of peer-to-peer cash. Which Bitcoin doesn't, they have a \"HODL\" mindset.\n\nEDIT: You can try a fee-less version of Bitcoin known as Bitcoin Cash. Then if you want to carry further, use Bitcoin Cash as your money if you want. If not, well, you did ask in the sub where big blockers were exiled from r/Bitcoin for not being a store of value.",

However, the point is blockchains can manage money because it is entirely on the blockchain. Bitcoins are no attempt at representing an external reality (some Bitcoin coin vault somewhere) but instead, the blockchain entry IS the Bitcoin. The entire mining operating is in place to track a single external variable not on the blockchain, that is \"time\".\n\nThe moment you try to do that for \"assets\" you create a disconnect. The NFT IS NOT the asset. It attempts to be a representation of something external to the blockchain. That means, the two, the NFT and the asset are at constant risk of falling out of sync so to say.\n\nHow does the blockchain representation learn about changes in the allegedly underlying asset? Simply, not at all. You can not track if it is destroyed, changed, sold, deleted, whatever and the blockchain would never know. There is no connection, it does not even solve an ownership problem, but it is sold under the pretense of being that.",

It\u2019s because The State has established laws allowing records to show that you can use that place and stuff to your liking. Where NFTs come in is allowing to own something by replacing the structure the state previously organized. \n\nThe only part missing is the enforcement.  The State can enforce their organization. Right now there is nothing reinforcing NFTs. Ideally coercion will be strictly incentive based but I am watching for the fiat signs of digital enforcement.

But when the chain of SLP tokens gets too long. Indexers and wallets begin to struggle. The infrastructure is pretty poor at best. \n\nThe downtime and maintenance costs are overwhelmingly high for SLP. \n\nsmartBCH came in at the best possible time to support the token projects on BCH. Bridging over is fairly simple. With JOY token we managed to get our community to bridge 3.9M JOY to sep20. Which is incredible considering the 4M fixed cap supply. \n\nAll of our current work is being done on evm powered chains like SmartBCH over at https://smart.joystick.club. All new games, nft tokens and staking contracts are all handled now on a chain that was built for tokens. \n\nSLP imho was like dragging a piano with a shoelace. Working on smartBCH and low fee evm chains feels elegant in comparison. \n\nSo yea. Dump SLP tokens, buy smartBCH tokens. And let's never go back to non-miner validated tokens again. EVM won for tokens. Let's innovate together there.",

One was the AtomicDEX SLP token support and one is an SLP DEX Electron cash plugin. the first one is complete after long delay but not released because of pending security edit. The second the person who promised to build said that he is facing many difficulties. Apparently the system is not very easy to deal with as it requires an indexer.  \nSLP main supporter knew about this and wanted to have a newer version of SLP that is miner validated which will make it easier to verify SLP tokens as it's to verify BCH tokens. However because of disagreements between developers it didn't see the light.  \n\n\nCurrently u/bitcoincashautist is doing great job in reviving a version of the token proposal that might make it possible to have native miner validated tokens on BCH. There is alos a work by jason dreyzehner hopefully there would be an agreement to deliver a solution to the SLP issue.",

There are of course many who have questions or concerns but this is simply about sparking the future of crypto for our country and making sure we are ready for the future as a small country. \n\nAs for moving to SXM, Americans citizens have an easy pathway to become a resident through the Dutch American Friendship treaty. For others opening a business in St Maarten such as for crypto investment or holding (a simple small company that costs around $5000 to set up) entitles you to directors licences that grants automatic residence. I look forward to more people setting up satelite micro businesses in St Maarten that would entitle you to all the benefits the island offers.",

Please don't!\n\n* If by 'legal tender', the proposition is to force shops and anyone who is owed money to have to receive it in BCH if their customers / debtors insist, this is to me a step too far. There's no need to copy Bukele's mistakes.\n\n* As a public servant, take any adviced given by a declared voluntarist with a pinch of salt because conflict of interest. In Ver's ideal world, your goverenment and all the public services that rely on it would collapse from lack of funds.\n\n* And if you didn't know already, ignore the BTC maximalists yelling at you in response to your tweet who have swallowed the small-blocker cool aid and repeat these bizarre narratives of what BCH is and its supposed centralisation vulnerabilities.\n\n^1 I do understand that many cryptocurrency owners also made large speculative gains but if to be used as money, it can not be subject to CGT.",

No other coin that I'm aware of can claim that, plus we are a BTC fork showing them how it was really meant to work. ETH itself was created out of BTCs lack of vision. We do need some quality implementations but that will happen. The push now is wrapped tokens, BCH can now easily get in on and link into these multiplatform bridges.",

If you're going to build an NFT marketplace, just be honest about the energy consumption (I refer to XOOA in particular) instead of trying to dupe corporations into making an \"ethical\" investment.\n\nThat said, individual photojournalists have given consent for their photos to be auctioned.
