They used the term 'color' just as terminology.  What i saw from this is that Starbucks could buy a bch, and by 'coloring' it with their code (some derivative of, or signed by, their private key?), they could say it was worth anything they wanted within their stores, so they could give away 300 milli-bch to customers and say each one was worth a cup of coffee. The 'security' is provided by the BCH network, and the 'color' guarantees it is a valid part of their promotion.  basically a free-ish, non-counterfeitable gift card/loyalty program.  \n\nThe idea seems kind of cool, the implementation seemed a little hacky, but to me it sounded like maybe that was adopted and then related to this cashaddr thing.",

Have old address format and new format and ability to switch.  Then you are fully compatible with the full ecosystem.
