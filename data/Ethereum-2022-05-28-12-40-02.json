This was focused around the realities of IP in a globalized decentralized / anonymous world.\n\nSo, this sorta value was expected knowledge of the reader but maybe shouldn't have been.\n\nArtists have more ways to capture their value more directly. It'll depend on your medium but an obvious one is secondary sales. I've never seen artists and art houses have a more stable business model than a community of collectors--this used to be exclusive to the 1% and \"the best\" generally pre-determined by art houses (Sotheby's). \n\nEvery artist regardless of medium creates a community of collectors. NFTs will only continue to grow as artists find empowerment through it.\n\nEvery time their art is sold and resold, they earn a % in perpetuity. The revenue is also directly from their art rather than some abstraction like merch. Something you can build on: token-based governance, expansions/airdrops, distributions, etc.\n\nA big discussion is music rights. This is more of a platform discussion. Creating a system that will automatically pay the artist & NFT holders every time its played or commercially downloaded. Likely on an L2.\n\nThe biggest transition is from having many fans you make very little, if anything, from (Web2) to fostering a small community of ride-or-die fans that you grow with. How you grow that is liberated, considering the sales are on a smart contract compared to the limited options you have on, say, Instagram.\n\nYouTubers in-part fight all of this crypto stuff because they are the king of ad revenue. Most other forms of art necessitate a more direct payment & relation with their fans (as seen with Substack, Locals, etc).\n\nI should also mention that disruption != replacement. All of these things will exist and be further tools & options for all sorts of creative people to explore.",
