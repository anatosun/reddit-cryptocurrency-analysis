            "selftext": "Hello, just a hypothetical thought i dont understand:\n\nImagine I have 51% of the Bitcoin Hashing Power and decide to redo a block that is f.e. already the 5th youngest block in the chain. \n\nI would change the transaction in that block so somebody gives me 100 BTC. Then id have to mine this block and the 4 blocks following it to be up to date again and even create a new block to have the longest chain.\n\nIf I then share my version of the blockchain with the rest of the network, the rest of the network will check if my chain is correct. Even though I solved every hashcash correctly for every block, the transaction I created just is not valid. So even though I have 51%  the rest of the network will not accept my chain right ? \n\nDoes this mean the only thing that having the 51% of the network benefits me is that I can double spend by creating a new chain from the present that is longer than the public chain and does not include my transactions  ill ad to the public chain in the same time ? To sum it up: Is it true that I cant change the blocks that have already been added even though I have 51% ?\n\nThank you !",

You can not make arbitrary transactions to spend a coin for which you don't have a key to make a signature, but ...  \n\nYou can spend Bitcoin in a regular miner's block, and then 51% mine your own block with a transaction which spends the same coins to yourself  \n\nIf the merchant sends you the goods in between when the transaction was confirmed and when the replacement block confirmed the send-to-self transaction, then you get to keep the Bitcoin and receive the goods  \n\nThe send-to-self transaction is valid because you're spending your own coins to yourself, using your key to sign the transaction\n\nIt's less work to mine your 51% attack chain tip in parallel with the regular miners. This avoids redoing the work of multiple blocks. You're just doing the work of your own blocks, and if your chain is longer you can release all the blocks at the same time to replace the regular miners' chain tip  \n\nSee this description of a successful attack on BTG  \nhttps://gist.github.com/metalicjames/71321570a105940529e709651d0a9765  \n\nThe attackers sold BTG to buy Bitcoin and spent 2 hours parallel mining. In their parallel blocks they spent their coins to themselves instead of the coin-to-coin exchange. After 2 hours, they submitted their 2 hours of blocks to replace the regular miners' most recent 2 hours of blocks. They kept their BTG and the exchange had already sent their Bitcoin",

For example, you can recreate the last block with all the same transactions that are included there ***minus one***, and then add a new block on top of it. Everyone will follow this new chain since it's longer (2 blocks in your chain vs 1 block in the old chain). If the transaction you removed was yours and you were paying someone, then those coins are back to you (you kind of \"charged back\" the payment).",
