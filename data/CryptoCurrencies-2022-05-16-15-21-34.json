I mean if its the supply or decentralization there is litecoin or even better monero who is anonym. So what is the point of bitcoin, just the fact that its the first crypto?\n\nThe Luna crash let me thought about if the same can happen to bitcoin (not the same way but no more trust and everybody selling) and i dont find the answer.",

Not even talking about the myriad of retail money in it dwarfing any other coin massively. Nothing short of a 51% attack could change that. Which is almost impossible and even if it would be managed then the cost of doing so coupled with the immediate devaluation of Btc would make this attempt an insane money loss.",

It really spawns from the idea that digital scarcity can only be achieved by having a single Ledger that remains the consensus chain of value over time. All technical achievements are secondary (and only relevant) if a single base value token can be maintained.\n\nAll these different chains competing is great for technical innovation, but it completely destroys the idea that you have one fixed supply that represents value. If value has to move around to different tokens in order to use different dApps then you cannot pursue the Austrian economic model of a fixed supply currency.\n\nBitcoiners see competitive base layers as an inherently flawed model from an economic standpoint. If you really think about it, they're right. Non-crypto people cannot and do not want to consider the value of 10 different gas tokens fluctuating against each other trying to interact with dApps... whether it be for gaming or more serious applications like DeFi.",
