Software wallets can be compromised if the computer or phone has malware or is hacked. While it is safe to use a hardware wallet with malware infested computer. It is just very important to write down and keep your passphrase safe, and never input it into a computer or software wallet if you use a hardware wallet. Never take photos of the passphrase. Some hardware wallets can be attached to software wallets and still remain secure with the hardware wallet using that to sign the transactions.",

These are not as safe as hardware wallets, but still relatively safe. To my knowledge there has been no cases of these wallets getting hacked out of phones.\n\nFor hardware, Coldcard is the best. Trezor is good. Ledgers are crap.",
