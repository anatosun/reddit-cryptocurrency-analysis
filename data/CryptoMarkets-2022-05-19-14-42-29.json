Blockchain's original use was to create cryptocurrency and because of the complexity and the security that the tech provides it actually gave value to crypto that is now measured in billions of dollars.  \nThat is not where its' application can end.  \n\n\nWhere do you think we will see blockchain implemented next ?  \n\n\nNow I've seen some examples where some companies like Giant, Telcoin, World Mobile Token seek to implement the tech in spheres like Telecommunications,  \nMicrosoft using blockchain for the purposes of creating Digital ID, even monitoring supply chains, is there no end in site.  \n\n\nNow would you invest in some enterprises that bring blockchain application to new spheres of life, do you believe that this can be profitable ?  \n\n\nI would also like to hear your opinions where it might go next or some examples that you have heard of it's usage.",

I\u2019m interested in other opinions, but so far the benefits are outweighed by the risks/cost. It still appears best suited for transaction-based currencies. There does seem to be some drive to establish digital tokens (like NFTs) for physical items such as expensive fashion/accessories. The next 12-18 months will most likely include broad experimentation.\n\nSome of my notes:\n\n* Blockchain provides a combination of technologies \u2014 PKI, P2P, etc. \u2014 but not all are valuable for every scenario and serve only to add complexity\n* Distributed architecture requires all participants to provide platform/storage/etc.\n* Transparency is most beneficial when exchange/transaction history must be available\n* Real-World transaction limits are still low for high-volumes\n\nPublic/Government components seem like good candidates. Things like permits, real-estate transactions, licensure, etc. But, there is a ton of variability in these across different jurisdictions and adoption is a high bar to cross. Some would require actual laws/regulations to change to adopt blockchain and there\u2019s no rush to do that. (It isn\u2019t essential and doesn\u2019t make financial sense.)\n\nEncrypted payloads on the chain are useful. But, really, we\u2019re just using the blockchain framework to push around paper. It has to be a use case that actually requires the combination of technologies.\n\nI\u2019m not certain I see profitability \u2014 at least not now. But, you mentioned a few opportunities in your post. If one of them gains traction, it could very well be the pivot. God knows, everyone has at least looked at it. ;)\n\nLooking forward to other comments.",
