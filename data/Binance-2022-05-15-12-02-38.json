The Axie Infinity team delivers \"Origin\" for Android users, adding to the positive attitude.\n\nAccording to FX Street, https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/binance-ceo-cz-applauds-axie-infinitys-team-axs-prepares-for-recovery-202205141404?_gl=1*1lnefbh*_ga*YW1wLVBMNm1xOWxCT2dxVHFGaFJuNzdVTDlkS3V4bVVfNGpKMWVoSjJ3ajQ5U0tXUnJuRGFka1lUbTNvUjZDSmFWZWk. \n\nAxie Infinity was impacted by the latest market correction, as the gaming token lost 15% of its value overnight. While the cryptocurrency market capitalization has been reduced by billions of dollars, supporters hope gaming tokens such as Axie Infinity can make a comeback.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao praised the Axie Infinity team for their work in addressing the Ronin bridge hack. Following recent occurrences such as UST's demise and LUNA's slide to zero, the crypto community has shifted its focus to gaming and metaverse tokens including Zetrix which powers a lot of project including NFT that are play to earn based, Solana which has a very large ecosystem and so on. \n\nThe CEO of the world's largest exchange indicated that the Terra team has not responded positively to the ongoing UST situation. In terms of action and responsiveness to a crisis, the team behind Axie Infinity differs from Terra. CZ believes Axie Infinity handled the problem well.\n\nAccording to analysts at @P2Edaily, the Axie Infinity price has remained stable against Bitcoin, despite the fact that the metaverse token has fallen against the USD.\n\nAnalysts such as @AltstreetBet anticipate the Axie Infinity price will decline and collapse to depths between $14 and $10, indicating a gloomy outlook.",

Pointless. Axie infinity is going nowhere, I think the recent hack would have been enough to send it to the ashes otherwise. I don't really think your analogy is the right one to use, political parties are full of over educated, sheltered, silver Spooners, that haven't ever had to live in the real world. Hopefully we have, crypto is a chance for what I refer to as 2nd class citizens and I'm proud to be one. If we hate any element of crypto, they will use it to prevent growth and eventual mainstream adoption. This will hurt us and us only, silver Spooners aren't hodlers like the rest of us, they make wealth from insider information and using false news to swing the markets taking away our money.
