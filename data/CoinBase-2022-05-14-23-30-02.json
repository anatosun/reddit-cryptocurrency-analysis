I\u2019m trying to send $19.50 in LTC to another wallet that I send LTC to very often, as in almost every day and sometimes multiple times a day. But for the past 30 minutes, every time I try to send it, it will tell me that something\u2019s wrong and to try again. And I\u2019ve tried closing the app completely and re opening. Tried sending a little less money than $19.50. Tried moving locations incase my service was bad. But nothing seems to be working. Is anyone else having issues like this right now? Could it possibly be that coinbase is down or something? Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!",
