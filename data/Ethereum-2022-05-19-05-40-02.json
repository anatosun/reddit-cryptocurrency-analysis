Just saying in the age of instant communication when his house is on fire, emotions at all time high, people are gonna say some stupid shit.\n\nHe cooled down and recognized or was convinced that he was being extreme, or as you say he was reluctantly forced to apologize to save face.\n\nEither way I'm sure he's learned something.  And in the meanwhile everyone else has learned that comp collects info on it's users and in a pinch will sell it to the IRS. And that other Defi projects will do the same.\n\nSo maybe doesn't mean \"fuck comp, sell all your shit\". But understand that you should take better steps to protect your privacy when using ETH.",

They used social reward which is an alternative behavioral incentive to monetary reward or punishment, yet a strong enough one in this instance as it worked well. Using any one project to make a wholistic claim about the DeFi ecosystem is likely just an exercise in confirmation bias and not an accurate or useful perspective on the much more complex reality.",

It may as well have a board of directors.\n\nI think it's actually a very clear example of why on-chain governance might not be a good thing.\n\nWe need something more like a Liquity equivalent of Compound. No upgrades, centered around Eth, no DAO to benefit from it. \n\nCompound is not sound in my opinion anymore.",
