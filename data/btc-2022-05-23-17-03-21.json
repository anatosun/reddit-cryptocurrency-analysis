You no longer have any fiat. You only hold digital tokens you hope can be redeemed for fiat. That \"published price\" of crypto selling for fiat at the centralized exchanges -- that's OTHER PEOPLE'S value. Not yours. You only get to find out what the value of your tokens are when/if you can cash them out.\n\nThe thing that really spoke to me here was the bolded text.\n\nIf what you care about is the *fiat entry / exit value* of your coins, then \n\n* you tacitly acknowledge that the coins have no real purpose other than speculating on a greater fool coming to buy them from you\n\n* you don't believe in a \"crypto future\" where the world runs on crypto -- you believe in a \"fiat future\" where nothing really changes\n\n... but if crypto doesn't really change anything, why is it worth anything ...\n\nI really resonated with this comment.

Many years ago I made a small investment in what I thought could be a revolutionary new form of money. Years later it appeared to have been hijacked and was clearly not meeting what I considered to be my expectations wrt direction. By then it was worth orders of magnitude more than it was when I started (as measured in fiat). So I took what any rational person would consider to be an amazing profit in fiat, and truthfully don't care if the remnants go to zero.\n\nNote, however: my exit was not predicated on Bitcoin hitting a magic fiat exit number, but based on it failing to meet my expectations re: development. I never expected to exit at all to fiat, and now that I've recouped my initial investment plus plenty more, its p2p cash or bust with the rest. I do not have high expectations.",
