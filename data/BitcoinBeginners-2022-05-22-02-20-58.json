            "selftext": "Does it really matter? I know to transfer to a wallet (don't have one set up yet) before I have much in there. Which one of them allows me to best track my gains/losses over time? \n\nCan anyone explain to me the purpose of crypto trading with the likes of SoFi, for example? I have a loan and investment account with them and I see I can buy crypto there. But... Is that different? I heard you can't deposit or withdraw there. So, what is the point? I have the crypto but basically have to liquidate the asset to use it, doesn't that defeat the purpose? Or is the purpose just to turn a profit based on the cost changes of various cryptos? \n\nIf I'm someone who would be looking to invest more in the short term (buying a lot like now, to sell in 6 months when the market is better) does it make more sense to invest with SoFi or on an exchange? Should my bitcoin (or any crypto) even be in a wallet then?",
