I think we all know that it often times doesn't go well for a lot of companies in the long run, and yet there is always that group of people that can't get enough of talking about their investment and expressing their undying belief in it. \n\nI have a theory that a lot of these sorts of people are usually ones that haven't suffered a big hit on an investment before. Especially the guys that give the huge pep talks when the price swings down and are adamant that \"you'll never be able to pick up BTC at this price again\". \n\nAnyway...do you have a healthy scepticism of your investment in BTC, or are you all in and have got to a point where you can't see the negative points to be made?",

To fully appreciate Bitcoin you really need at least a basic understanding of \"money\" and the kinds of problems inherent w/ its various forms.  \n\nWhen Bitcoin came along, I read the Bitcoin White Paper.  It sounded too good to be true, even though it was exactly the kind of thing I'd been looking for.  So, I re-read the whitepaper more carefully, looking for the \"catch,\" or serious flaw.  I was impressed but still not sure, so I went over the paper, sentence by sentence, making sure I fully understood.  I even looked into the Bitcoin source code to check the hashing functions, etc.\n\nAfter that, I had a much-better-than-average understanding of money and the problems inherent to the current banking system and I also had a good enough understanding of what Bitcoin actually IS and the basics of how it works.\n\nI started buying $500 per day of BTC, using up my down payment money for real estate.  You see, Bitcoin made other forms of long-term investing obsolete, even though most people haven't realized it yet: real estate, stocks, bonds, precious stones, precious metals (all are doomed, long term).\n\nFrom what you wrote, it appears that the only thing you know about Bitcoin is its recent price history.  You're really missing out on the best opportunity of your entire life.

Precious gems are... well, you'd better know what you're doing.  Bitcoin's long term average ROI beats the pants off of all of them.  \n\nGory details:  \n\nPeople buy homes, for example, to avoid having savings eaten by inflation and also to hopefully have inflation also eat away at their loan balance.\n\nLess sophisticated real estate investors see the price of homes going up, and neglect to account for inflation.  For them, \"number go up\" is good enough.\n\nUltimately, the price of homes (and rent) is limited by incomes.  Incomes barely keep up with inflation (long term).  Bitcoin has no such limit to its price.  In fact, Bitcoin's price goes up way faster than inflation, and for lots of good reasons will continue to do so.\n\nMeanwhile, real estate has significant hold costs: taxes, maintenance, fees, insurance, and (in many cases) mortgage interest.  Bitcoin has no holding costs.\n\nAlso, there is a significant upfront costs to get into real estate - down payment, all sorts of fees, sometimes \"points\", moving costs, etc.  You can buy Bitcoin a few dollars at a time, for example.  You don't need a big wad of money up front.  \n\nReal estate is nailed down.  If you need to flee (war, economic collapse, social unrest, environmental disaster, etc.) you can't take a home with you.  My Bitcoin goes with me everywhere I go; nobody can take if from me or even know whether I have any.  Nailed down real estate is a sitting duck for higher taxes.\n\nSimilar things apply to stocks, though, they're still way better than real estate.  Bonds right now are completely insane, plus, bond trading requires expert knowledge.",

I'm not 100% in bitcoin, same as I'm not all in on the USD, shares of Wal-mart, or real estate.  \n\nThe more you research, the more you'll find out that what btc is doing is the first successful case of its kind.  Then you'll find that many of the minds supporting it are engineers and people who love things built strong, and to last.  \n\nI've tried to break it... \"Energy useage, what if governments tax it massively, what about quantum computing, it's too complicated, it's too simple...\" on and on and I've found pretty substantial answers for why btc is actually pretty low risk compared to many investments including stocks, bonds, gold, property.  It's also got the capability to change resource management for the better for the world in my opinion.  So, I store energy in it, at first because I couldn't break it, but now because I believe in it.  \n\nCareful, or you too will one day vehemently support a form of money that promotes long-term thinking, spending energy only on the things you have a passion or true need for, and has you wondering why you every thought a government full of career politicians knew the best way to create and regulate a monetary system long-term.",

If you are 25 you probably see real estate out of your reach with today's prices so that avenue to build wealth is difficult.  You would also see inflation numbers that should make you a little uncomfortable about building a savings account.  The stock market and many of today's major corporations have been fueled by almost free money so those investments also appear shaky.  Retirement for a lot of people now looks like an impossibility.  So if a new asset class come around and you can get in on the ground floor for as little as $100 you would want to believe with all of your heart.  I do see it a little differently.  I know that something is worth only what someone else will pay you for it.  If the future generations want BTC to work it probably will so I hold BTC.  It is a little clunky at this point, but when enough people want something to work it can.  I like the libertarian aspect of BTC and I think it will become easy enough for the average person to use.  Hope that helps.  I feel like I know you were wanting the intrinsic value conversation, but BTC is a bit more complicated or maybe much much more simple.",

The big difference between bitcoin and a specific stock is exactly that: it\u2019s not a stock. It\u2019s a network that thrives on increased balance sheets of governments and that trend cannot be reversed. It can only have its rate of growth be slowed down, but still goes up.  \n3. I\u2019ve learned several lessons through investments: do not try to time markets, specically with leverage.   \nThe negative point that I do see is that many in bitcoin believe that there is nothing else besides bitcoin. Well I believe that bitcoin is special. I do not believe that every other crypto is valueless.  \nThe reason people are confident in bitcoin is that it cannot be bribed and it\u2019s based on math.",
