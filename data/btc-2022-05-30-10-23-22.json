As the price fluctuates to around $30,000, the past 2-week cycle was recorded with the mining revenues of $0.12 per 1 TH/s.\n\nMore ASICs approach their breakeven prices. At the time of writing, miners with unit power of 60W/T could barely generate profits since the electricity cost rate was around 95%, and the cost rate for miners with a unit power above 65 W/T was more than 100%. This means that their electricity costs had exceeded the revenues that could be brought by the miners at the power rate of $0.08 per kWh.

This in turn supports / pumps the price of BTC.  So you could say that BTC *price* is backed by Tether, but obviously BTC itself isn't \"backed\" by anything.\n\nAlso it should be made clear that nobody knows what is backing Tether.  The close affiliation between iFinex and Blockstream  (as well as the price correlations etc) would surely imply a likelihood that BTC makes up at least some of Tether's backing.  But in reality we don't know, we just assume.\n\nHTH",

Even Russia doesnt give a shit, and they are blocked from international payment systems. What else needs to happen for people to care for p2p money?
