I knew what my goals were before I ever made my purchase over a year ago. The difference in me and many others is I have a stone cold mind. I haven't even allowed myself the option to follow doge in a price sense because I know how tempting it is to panic constantly. I set my alert for $1 and am not touching it until then. Period. The only reason I am here today leaving this message is because my dang news feed popped up a message about 52 week low for doge. I knew you Jabronis would be panicking so I figured why not come drop a message of encouragement. Get your Twitter fingers off my doge page with your \"we're going down\" memes and go invest in Pampers you lilly livers. I'll be happy you're gone so we can get real steadfast men and women to replace you. \n\nSincerely,\n\nIronclad Doge Hodler",
