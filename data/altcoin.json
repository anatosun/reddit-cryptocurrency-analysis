This is why it expands socially slowly, since there are no founders owning any percentage of the supply for paying \"influencers\" ot greedy exchanges' CEOs.\n\nBut IMHO BitcoinZ will be among the coins that will susprise us all sooner or later.\nIn the future as more people realize what the true crypto idea is about (& it is not about gambling with tokens and paying 170$ for eth fees lol), the DeFi bubble will burst and classic independent networks like DGB, Monero, BitcoinZ etc will benefit a lot. Projects like BITCOINZ will be always a classic.\n\n\n BitcoinZ made an excellent network adding ASIC resistance with its Zhash algo (providing the opportunity to everybody to mine it with PC), offering optional privacy with Zksnarks cryptography and next to Zero fees with its ideal max supply of 21B.\n\nThese are the reasons why it is called Bitcoin+Z.\nBecause it honors all the fundamentals of the original crypto idea and added everything missing.\n\nIt is among the very few real crypto out there never acted as Central Authorities.\n(I remind that Eth allocated 70M coins to founder addresses and to ICO while BNB, XRP, ADA and of course all the tokens out there allocate all their supplies to their founders before selling them to people... this is far away from the original logic of the cryptocurrency idea and has no difference with the Central Banks approach).",

Currently, blockchain mining consumes enough energy globally to be considered a small country in the top thirty of energy users. As the sector expands, energy requirements increase exponentially. Leaders in the industry fight to build the most profitable mining operations possible. Because fossil fuels are still the cheapest, most accessible option, these companies tend to turn their focus here. Relying on fossil fuels makes smaller mining operations vulnerable to fluctuations in costs and increases gas fees on transactions. It also makes blockchain mining as a whole dependent on governments, how they handle energy production, and their tolerance of cryptocurrencies. As blockchains continue to expand, there will come a breaking point where the practicality of using cryptocurrencies will be called into question.",

But it's not an excuse and as one of early project contributors and developers - I'll continue to do as much as I can to make it better for everyone :).\n\nHeart of our community is at [Epic Cash Telegram](https://t.me/EpicCash), go there and you will feel why this is just nice place to be in today's crypto space - it just feels good man :) If everything is shitcoin until it's not - at least here time is spent with good company!  \n\n\nPS. As an addition Mimblewimble is a cool technology and combined with Bitcoin emission system creates interesting offer for investors.",

I try not to make solid predictions about markets, but this is an exception: Bitcoin *won't* pull a 18,000x gain again, because there literally isn't enough money in the world to support a $18 quadrillion market cap. So while I certainly expect Bitcoin to continue to grow over the next few years, I think we have to expect more modest gains.\n\nThe same is not true of altcoins: something with a $1 billion market cap probably won't grow 18,000x (to an $18 trillion market cap) but at least there's enough money in existence to support that remote possibility. I think it's entirely realistic to hope that a coin other than Bitcoin or Ethereum will hit $1 trillion market cap in the next 10 years--and that would be a minimum 10x gain for any altcoin. Which altcoin that is, I don't know. :)",

Most PoS projects like Solana need centralized validators with NASA supercomputer specs to do anything somewhat scalable.\n\nMeanwhile Syscoin can stay PoW while using Bitcoin's mining power at no extra cost while achieving 4 million TPS with zksnark rollups. All on a network with 2500+ masternodes that need a measly 2 cores and 8gb of ram. Light, very fast, and cheap transactions.\n\nCardano has a $75 billion market cap with essentially no product and a worse final vision even if they do realize their goals after years of promises. And then they'll have to compete with the future PoS king, Ethereum 2.0. Meanwhile Syscoin will be the PoW smart contract option with no contenders. Currently at $150 million cap.

Following that, if the Utility of said network is high, than the tokens required to use it are valuable. Obviously that\u2019s what then creates the buying demand that drives the price of it.\n\nIn a lot of cases yes, developers will hold substantial bags that they will profit from or use to fund further development, but that\u2019s not always the case.

People invest in meme coins because they see SHIB and DOGE making a few people rich, but what they're not seeing is that literally millions of other meme coins just get created and then disappear from existence, taking all investors' cash with them. And many of these get very large before that happens.\n\nTake for example, the recent [Squid Game token](https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2021/11/02/crypto-coin-riding-squid-game-high-craters-after-dizzying-rally): which reached $2.4 billion market cap before rug pulling and taking most of that market cap with them. This was *completely* predictable--the only thing unpredictable about this was how high the coin got before they rug pulled it.\n\nI challenge anyone who thinks investing in meme coins is a good idea, to actually track your profits and losses for a year. You might get a win here and there, but I can almost guarantee  that you'll lose more money on rug pulls and simple failures than you make on the handful of successes.\n\nI remember a post from r/CryptoMoonShots where the poster was saying they've been rug pulled so many times that they're \"immune\" to it. That boggles my mind. I've *never* been rug pulled, and I like to think that if I got rug pulled once or twice, I'd learn my lesson and stop investing in meme coins.\n\nIt's worth noting, too, that just because you avoid meme coins doesn't mean you can't hit lotteries. I'm currently holding CXO, which I think has a small chance of pulling a 100x, for example.",

I try not to make solid predictions about markets, but this is an exception: Bitcoin *won't* pull a 18,000x gain again, because there literally isn't enough money in the world to support a $18 quadrillion market cap. So while I certainly expect Bitcoin to continue to grow over the next few years, I think we have to expect more modest gains.\n\nThe same is not true of altcoins: something with a $1 billion market cap probably won't grow 18,000x (to an $18 trillion market cap) but at least there's enough money in existence to support that remote possibility. I think it's entirely realistic to hope that a coin other than Bitcoin or Ethereum will hit $1 trillion market cap in the next 10 years--and that would be a minimum 10x gain for any altcoin. Which altcoin that is, I don't know. :)",

So far, the focus has been on community while the devs build the software.  \n\nThe first piece to be released will be the Goji Swap which learns from the swaps that have come before it.  Why another swap?  I asked that question.  It turns out they're going to need it for the other parts of the SaaS. \n\nThe community, thus far, has been a great place to learn more about things and crypto as a whole.  The community response has been so good that the lead dev quit his fortune 100 company job to focus 100% on Goji.  After having had several chats with him I'm stoked with confidence.\n\nIt's still very early and there are several challenges ahead but I believe I'm in a good place.

By time I get to uniswap I only have $43 left because fees got it. But o well I hit the button to swap now for robuinu and it wants more fees but says it has to verify on etherscan so I hit that button and it starts circling like it's verifying for an hour till I gave up. Then repeated the process 2 more times with the same result.  Guess I'm computer illiterate  plus don't see how you can make any money when your down 60 percent in fees before you even start. Anyone got any advice on how to buy this?",

(Discord is the best place to talk and listen and get a feel for what\u2019s going on) https://discord.gg/V6XNDeN7\n\nSecond the community is solid organic and not full of bullshit and hype. \n\nThird, I\u2019ve been staking since they started that a few weeks back, and I\u2019ve been earning around 7% a week. \n\nAnd while I\u2019ve made more on moonshots and well timed rug pulls, there is one big difference, \n\nNovo doesn\u2019t make me nervous.  \n\nIt\u2019s going to go up. \n\nI think It\u2019s only a matter of time before the altcoin community that follows BSC coins is going to find this coin and start using it like a store of value coin or a sure thing investment. \n\n7% a week is a lot. \n\nI have stocks that I hold onto for dear life that only make 8% a year\u2026.\n\nNow granted, currently, you have to unstake to take the profits. But if these guys can do the time-factored staking that they think they can do\u2026 then all that will be a thing of the past. \n\nThey are basically making an NFT that holds your place in the staking line, so you get bigger rewards than the next guy who staked later or didn\u2019t hold. \n\nSo it actually pays to stake and hold whether the coin goes up or down, because stakers get rewards based on volume. Buys or sells. \n\nBut whatever, \n\nDYOR.",

Who knows how many more will ape in giving 10 years from now?However, transitioning from Cefi to Defi can be difficult for enterprise and institutional investors due to the fact that they have been used to Cefi for so long but crypto is decentralized and there might be some risk that comes with Defi as well , so most of them may end up using a crypto custodian solution like Unido to invest in crypto and Defi.So, where do I see crypto custodian solutions in the next ten years?

At least read up on it on CoinMarketCap, see how old it is, how much is distributed, what people are saying. Or expect to throw away your money.",

                    "response": "There's literally no reason to ever buy a meme coin. Ever. Period.\n\nRug pulls pretty much only happen to meme coins. Scammers make meme coins because then they don't have to bother with creating any sort of value proposition. Scammers aren't targeting people who want to invest in coins with a value proposition, because it's harder. So what it comes down to, is, if you don't invest in meme coins you pretty much never have to worry about being rug pulled. I know a lot of people who invest in crypto, and of the people who don't invest in meme coins, none of them have been rug pulled, ever, and none of them ever bother checking sites like Rug Doctor, because rug pulls simply aren't a concern you have unless you invest in meme coins.\n\nRevoked ownership isn't better. Sure, if done properly, that means you can't be rug pulled. But it also means that they can't edit the contract for the coin. If there's a bug they can't fix it, and it can't be improved. A coin with revoked ownership has no future.\n\nSome people get into meme coins because they want to treat them like a lottery ticket, where you have a small chance of getting really rich by picking the next DOGE or SHIB. But the reality is, you don't need to invest in meme coins to play lottery ticket coins. LINK's low was about $0.15 and its high was about $50. MATIC was $0.005, now it's $2.67. LUNA was $0.12, now it's $90. You are *more likely to win a lottery* if you pick a random project with at least a basic value proposition than if you pick a meme coin.\n\nAnd, with serious projects, there's the possibility of a middle ground. There are a bunch of small cap coins where I've made 2x-5x gains. That's not winning a lottery, but it's not nothing either. I lost a lot of money on Ethereum this month, but one small coin pulled a 2.5x gain this month and so I'm ahead for the month of December.",

If you understand all those terms well, you have a better understanding of what determines the price of a coin than probably 90% of the people on this subreddit.\n\nI'm working on starting a blog soon, which hopefully will help folks learn the basics of crypto.

By time I get to uniswap I only have $43 left because fees got it. But o well I hit the button to swap now for robuinu and it wants more fees but says it has to verify on etherscan so I hit that button and it starts circling like it's verifying for an hour till I gave up. Then repeated the process 2 more times with the same result.  Guess I'm computer illiterate  plus don't see how you can make any money when your down 60 percent in fees before you even start. Anyone got any advice on how to buy this?",

Beforehand I've been seeing users suggesting RBIF due to the reflections and how it was early.\n\nThe community and the dev team are what really got me to stay. I've read the whitepaper and watched a dozen of their weekly AMAs and was convinced by the engagement and vision of Vy (Project Lead), Tommy and others that I just bought in (while waiting for gas fees to be reasonably cheaper :D).\n\nWhat also made me stay is their plan to grow without overhyping, or huge influencer pulls but by the actions and deliverables of the dev team to the community. They ADAPT. At one point some fudders came and the team got RBIF listed to Bitmart earlier. As an early investor, waiting for their flagship product \"RoboWallet\" to be released gets stressful, which is true for any project. But the team is doing their best to calm everyone down by doing something to help stabilize the price. And besides, IT'S EARLY.\n\nI've also learned a lot about how crypto projects are handled because Vy just drops behind the scenes information on us to be transparent. It made me even more confident. I am a software developer of 8 years, who wants to contribute in the development of RBIF products but I have zero blockchain experience so I am studying it for a couple of months and try applying as a developer. It's just fun and rewarding being in the community. Get in now!",

The project lead gives daily AMA calls, fully involved with the community and totally aligned with the investors.\n\nWhat is amazing about this project is not only do they offer a MASSIVE 11% BUSD rewards, the payout ratio per token owned is also one of the highest. Comparing to Reflex Finance as an example for a similar market cap, EverEarn rewards payout ratio is approx. 3 times higher for the same amount of tokens owned. I think this is partly because EverEarn specifically excludes tokens in LP, locked for future CEX listing, and locked staking from reward calculation. The tokenomics is fully explained explained to the community, leaving no room for doubt.\n\nAlso, EverEarn will roll out 4 utilities within 4 - 6 weeks after launch. This shows the business-savvy mindset and detailed calculation the team are showing to ensure the success of the project.",

But o well I hit the button to swap now for robuinu and it wants more fees but says it has to verify on etherscan so I hit that button and it starts circling like it's verifying for an hour till I gave up. Then repeated the process 2 more times with the same result.  Guess I'm computer illiterate  plus don't see how you can make any money when your down 60 percent in fees before you even start.

Currently, blockchain mining consumes enough energy globally to be considered a small country in the top thirty of energy users. As the sector expands, energy requirements increase exponentially. Leaders in the industry fight to build the most profitable mining operations possible. Because fossil fuels are still the cheapest, most accessible option, these companies tend to turn their focus here. Relying on fossil fuels makes smaller mining operations vulnerable to fluctuations in costs and increases gas fees on transactions. It also makes blockchain mining as a whole dependent on governments, how they handle energy production, and their tolerance of cryptocurrencies. As blockchains continue to expand, there will come a breaking point where the practicality of using cryptocurrencies will be called into question.",

But o well I hit the button to swap now for robuinu and it wants more fees but says it has to verify on etherscan so I hit that button and it starts circling like it's verifying for an hour till I gave up. Then repeated the process 2 more times with the same result.  Guess I'm computer illiterate  plus don't see how you can make any money when your down 60 percent in fees before you even start.

There are previews on the website on what it looks like but basically it's a 2D metaverse where you can create your own avatar, tame a pet, and chat with others.\n\nThe good thing about Klove is that it's still under development which means the potential utilities/activities in the social platform is basically infinite.\nHellsing's team is well versed in NFTs and it'll be easy for them to develop Land NFTs, House NFTs but that'll probably be on the following quarters. \ud83d\udd25",

These NFTs will support multiple gameplay methods which can provide earnings for NFT holders.\n\nOrclands gamenomics is a term we use to define the sustainability model for our multiple methods of gameplay. We will ensure that the gameplay will be rewarding via certain system constraints which will be detailed within the whitepaper. However, in short there will be a limited number of concurrent players, availability of NFTs, life span of NFTs and ROI for investment.\n\nNFT Collection: Orcs, Lands, Weapons, Armour and Tools. Other NFTS such as magical Items can only be obtained through mining activities;\n\nVillain Battle: Warriors Orc is the pride of the colony, always in battle against colony threats. Wizards, Priest and Thief Orcs also have unique battle abilities. \n\nBoss Battle: Orclands is full or surprises, and Mega Orc is the very first threat to Orc society as he attempts domination. Team up to defeat him to share in large prize pools. \n\nFarming: is a great way to produce ORC tokens as passive income with the Farmer Orc NFT and NFT Tools;\n\nMine: Very rare magical NFT items suchs as potions and spellbooks can only be obtained by mining through the use of the Miner Orc NFT;\nOrc Markets: Buy and sell of NFTs in the Orc Markets.
