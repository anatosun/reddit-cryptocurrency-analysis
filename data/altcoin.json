Most PoS projects like Solana need centralized validators with NASA supercomputer specs to do anything somewhat scalable.\n\nMeanwhile Syscoin can stay PoW while using Bitcoin's mining power at no extra cost while achieving 4 million TPS with zksnark rollups. All on a network with 2500+ masternodes that need a measly 2 cores and 8gb of ram. Light, very fast, and cheap transactions.\n\nCardano has a $75 billion market cap with essentially no product and a worse final vision even if they do realize their goals after years of promises. And then they'll have to compete with the future PoS king, Ethereum 2.0. Meanwhile Syscoin will be the PoW smart contract option with no contenders. Currently at $150 million cap. If you like potential gains or tech I don't see a better project.",

So far, the focus has been on community while the devs build the software.  \n\nThe first piece to be released will be the Goji Swap which learns from the swaps that have come before it.  Why another swap?  I asked that question.  It turns out they're going to need it for the other parts of the SaaS. \n\nThe community, thus far, has been a great place to learn more about things and crypto as a whole.  The community response has been so good that the lead dev quit his fortune 100 company job to focus 100% on Goji.  After having had several chats with him I'm stoked with confidence.\n\nIt's still very early and there are several challenges ahead but I believe I'm in a good place.

Beforehand I've been seeing users suggesting RBIF due to the reflections and how it was early.\n\nThe community and the dev team are what really got me to stay. I've read the whitepaper and watched a dozen of their weekly AMAs and was convinced by the engagement and vision of Vy (Project Lead), Tommy and others that I just bought in (while waiting for gas fees to be reasonably cheaper :D).\n\nWhat also made me stay is their plan to grow without overhyping, or huge influencer pulls but by the actions and deliverables of the dev team to the community. They ADAPT. At one point some fudders came and the team got RBIF listed to Bitmart earlier. As an early investor, waiting for their flagship product \"RoboWallet\" to be released gets stressful, which is true for any project. But the team is doing their best to calm everyone down by doing something to help stabilize the price. And besides, IT'S EARLY.\n\nI've also learned a lot about how crypto projects are handled because Vy just drops behind the scenes information on us to be transparent. It made me even more confident. I am a software developer of 8 years, who wants to contribute in the development of RBIF products but I have zero blockchain experience so I am studying it for a couple of months and try applying as a developer. It's just fun and rewarding being in the community. Get in now!",

The ducks are near lined up now! Once it goes, it'll be gone and you'll read about it like you did with SHIB. Robo is currently at 9 zero's. Now is the time to fuel your chance for some financial freedom. Now is the time to back yourself!!\n\nYou've been told.",

Good roadmap, quality dev team, fully doxed, fantastic community, still very early entry, nearing Phase 2 on its road map with holders, and excellent tokenomics which pay nice reflections for early adopters.  Can\u2019t speak highly enough of the project. DYOR, not a whale, just a quality investor sharing the love.",
