An attacker being able to dump RAM is still possible but considerably harder, that\u2019s good enough for me.\n\nThat got me thinking, how are all the big time managed staking like Coinbase, Lido, RocketPool keeping their fleet of validator servers secure? \n\nThey\u2019re very likely running VMs on cloud providers. I know it\u2019s very unlikely that AWS or Google Cloud will pull a RAM dump on them, but credentials can still get compromised as we\u2019ve seen it happen so many times before. I want to follow the best practices to be at least as secure as them.\n\nMy plan to secure my validator node:\n\n- Bare-metal server\n- My own VPN, always on with killswitch enabled (might use ZeroTier or Tailscale for this)\n- Firewall only accepting incoming connections from the VPN subnet\n- Only SSH incoming connection allowed, with port-knocking to expose-hide the custom port, only my SSH key allowed to login\n- Run geth and validator software out of an encrypted partition\n\nThis sounds good to me, but is there anything else I should do?",

That's how you take unnecessary downtime.\n\nDon't try to have it automatically fail over to a second ready to go machine, that's how you get slashed.",
