Therefore, you might be asked to re-verify your Binance account from time to time. For example, we require existing users to perform Identity Verification again after we upgrade our compliance standards to be fully aligned with the latest regulation\n\nWe're very sorry that we cannot gather or provide any account-specific information for user privacy and security here on Reddit, thus we really appreciate it if you can reach us directly on our Live Chat Support Channel [www.binance.com/en/chat](https://www.binance.com/en/chat) , if you have done so, we kindly ask for the case ID, please share it here and we will check and follow up to you.\n\n  \nThank you so much for your understanding",

It worked the first time, so why the hell doesn't it work again? \n\nI haven't figured out how to contact Binance for help either. I just find the same stupid tutorials on how to verify your account, and it doesn't work.",
