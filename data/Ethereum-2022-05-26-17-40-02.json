In a way that  everyone who holds Bitcoin automatically owns the same amount of this  token? A fork of Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain, so to say.",

You could make a smart contract that issues a tokenized version of Bitcoin and you can claim them if you can prove you own UTXOs that were unspent at a specific block height. Then if you insist you can still code PoW into the smart contract to keep issuing new tokens the same way the current blockchain is doing, although there's no security benefit in doing that.\n\nThe real challenge is a social one, you would have be to get enough people to agree \"okay, starting at this specific block height, the Real\u2122 bitcoin is the one that was issued by this smart contract\" which I don't see ever happening.\n\nAnd like others have said you have wBTC to wrap bitcoin onto Ethereum but this comes with its own trust/security assumptions. Maybe in the future we'll have trustless bridges with zk magic (I know someone is trying to build that on StarkNet)",
