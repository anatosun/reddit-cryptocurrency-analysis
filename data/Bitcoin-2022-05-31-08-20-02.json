If you bought at or near an ATH then you currently lost more than inflation and would need price to rise a fair amount above ath and sustain it.  Or at any price and it drops below your entry price, you\u2019re no longer outpacing inflation and possibly better off just taking the hit on inflation.\n\nBut I know you\u2019re talking long term so anything could happen in terms of price, so let\u2019s just assume you\u2019re Bitcoin investment outpaces inflation with the hodling strategy.\n\nHow do you pay your mortgage, buy food, go shopping at the majority of stores?  With fiat, of course\u2026 \n\nHow do you buy more even buy more Bitcoin?  Certainly you\u2019re working a job that pays in fiat so you can survive or living off someone else who is\u2026 so I guess you escape inflation by passing it to whoever you\u2019re freeloading off of\u2026not saying you do. Just trying to think of a situation where you\u2019re hodling btc and not spending fiat currently.  I\u2019d honestly like to know how.\n\nEdit: is it ironic that buying btc is an inflationary transaction, largely due to the increase of the price of Bitcoin compared to the inflation of the usd?  Or is it only ironic on the short term since price will go up",
