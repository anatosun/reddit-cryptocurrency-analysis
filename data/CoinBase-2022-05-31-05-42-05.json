            "selftext": "I am very frustrated as I am writing this message. I opened a case on the 20th of May with regards to the fact that I was unable to login to my account despite the fact that I used my device. I even performed a password change as well. I then got a response that they were working on my case and will get back to me.  I checked my email today and it said that case was closed. I do not understand how the case can be closed when the issue was not resolved. I am still unable to login to my account.  It is still saying account temporarily restricted. I need to get this matter resolved because all my live savings is on the platform and I am literarily unable to have any access to any funds for my day to day activities. This is causing me a lot of stress and affecting my mental health. Please help me resolve this issue so that I can access my account. The number to the old case is: 11932328. That case was not resolved and now I have to open a new case on the same issue. I hope to get this resolved as soon as possible. The case number to new case is: 12041812. I cannot understand how they can close a case when it has not been resolved",

What I am blaming coinbase for is holding my money and not allowing me access to my account, and not telling me what I need to do to solve the issue. Perhaps if you read my message clearly, you will understand that the problem was that their support was useless is addressing my issue.",
