Yeah right I\u2019m sure that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ll do. I\u2019m out $6,000+ anyone have any ideas to help me get back my money???  Coinbase suggested I contact the FBI.",

I emailed and they created a support ticket. Then, after the problem had already been fixed, they sent a nonsensical and irrelevant response.\n\nIt seems like it wouldn't be hard to have handled that better, or at least send a response that was even marginally related to the reported problem. I'm really doubting whether I'll continue with Coinbase. It's great when it works. But eventually something goes wrong. And then the support is so laughably bad that I can't even understand how its possible to create such ineffectual support without actively trying to make it bad.\n\nGiven that Coinbase's reaction to one thing going wrong was to completely lock up my account, and then provide zero avenues for finding out when or why I might have access again, it's hard for me to consider putting any more money in their care.",

The live support agents from the US Card department say my card is still active and the support agents from the Accounts department say they can't see any reason my account would be suspended\n\nAn agent in the Accounts department escalated my claims over the phone last night (04/20/2022), and said I would receive a confirmation email within 5-10 minutes and I have yet to receive one. I called again and a second agent recommended I send a message to the help desk with my case #. I've done so and all I've gotten so far is an automated message saying that it's been received.\n\nThis is one of the worst experiences I've had with a card. I have a fairly significant amount of money loaded on there to pay my monthly bills and now I don't have enough in my other accounts to make the payments.",
