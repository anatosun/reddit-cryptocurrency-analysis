I've called live support for both the US Card and Accounts departments and they each refer me to the other. Neither department can tell me why my card is being temporarily suspended. The live support agents from the US Card department say my card is still active and the support agents from the Accounts department say they can't see any reason my account would be suspended\n\nAn agent in the Accounts department escalated my claims over the phone last night (04/20/2022), and said I would receive a confirmation email within 5-10 minutes and I have yet to receive one. I called again and a second agent recommended I send a message to the help desk with my case #. I've done so and all I've gotten so far is an automated message saying that it's been received.\n\nThis is one of the worst experiences I've had with a card. I have a fairly significant amount of money loaded on there to pay my monthly bills and now I don't have enough in my other accounts to make the payments.",

Yeah right I\u2019m sure that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ll do. I\u2019m out $6,000+ anyone have any ideas to help me get back my money???  Coinbase suggested I contact the FBI.",
