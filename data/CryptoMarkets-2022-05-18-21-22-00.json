Now most unique and intriguing DeFi based projects are launching from the polygon blockchain and thats a fact. One unique kickstarter project launching on polygon that caught my eye is KOLnet that monetizes influencers by giving early access to pre-sale crypto in lieu of their services. Polygon is now seen in a new light and i think it would surpass Eth . Seems like Eth has a lot of work ahead of it now.",
