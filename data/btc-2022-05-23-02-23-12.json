                    "response": "As it looks, many (including /u/memorydealers) think that the original bitcoin pizza transaction was an example of a transaction in which bitcoin was used as a medium of exchange. That is an error, as the analysis below demonstrates:\n\nWhen Laszlo Hanyecz exchanged his bitcoins for pizza, the bitcoins he used in the exchange were originally obtained by him as a mining reward. Economically, we must consider the bitcoins Hanyecz used in the exchange as his own product. Thus, from the economical point of view, Hanyecz exchanged his own product for a product of somebody else, making his transaction a simple barter.\n\nThere was also a counterparty: the person who obtained the bitcoins from Hanyecz. The economical situation of the counterparty was significantly more complicated. The counterparty wanted Hanyecz' bitcoins. To achieve that goal, the counterparty first used fiat money to buy pizza and then obtained Hanyecz' bitcoin in exchange for the pizza. As far as the pizza buying part of the transaction is considered, we can classify the fiat money as a medium of exchange, since the fiat money were not a product of the counterparty and we see that the counterparty acquired the fiat money to exchange them for pizza in the transaction. For the counterparty, the pizza served as a medium of exchange in the subsequent part of the transaction, since the counterparty bought the pizza only to exchange it for the bitcoins. Since the ownership of bitcoins was the goal of this transaction, we know that the counterparty did not obtain the bitcoins to exchange them for something else in it, so this transaction cannot really serve as an example of a transaction, in which bitcoins are used as a medium of exchange.\n\nEdit: correct wording",
