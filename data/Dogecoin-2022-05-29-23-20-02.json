Everyone's entitled to their choices of whom to support. \n\nWill say though, we're not asking here as a \"cause\" to be supported, per se. \n\nFlag football and amateur sports are on the rise across the US, and smart sponsorship in those spaces can be great for advancing organizations. In addition, we have a very innovative approach to how we play, that we think can make us really good.\n\nI say all that to say, we're not looking for donations in the 100% charity sense. We're looking to be supported by the community in order to be able to honestly claim we are, and we want to help advance Dogecoin as much as we can, with the vehicle we have, that being our team.\n\nI hope that clarifies things.",
