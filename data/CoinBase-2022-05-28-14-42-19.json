            "selftext": "I recently received some USDT as materials budget for a project.  It landed in my Coinbase Wallet and then I sought to cash out.  Trying to transfer from CB wallet to CB .com kept giving the \"unable to determine network fee\" message.  I transferred a couple hundo ETH from CB to wallet to make sure I had Gas.  Then I messed up.  I assumed that maybe the Wallet needed to swap the USDT to USD to transfer. (CB.com started requiring the USD swap to cash out awhile back).  Wallet's 1st suggested coin transfer was a big black D, said Dollar...USD.  Iswapped all the USDT for what I thought was cash.  Turns out it was a one way transfer to \"Dollar Coin\" USDx...not Kava USDX, not the other USDXs.  The Dollar Coin isn't supported by CB, won't transfer, apparently can't be changed back, is supported on very few other exchanges (many look too sus for me to use)  I'm trying to interface w UniSwap to sell at a massive loss.  All I'm getting from any action in CB Wallet is \"unable to determine network fee\". Trying to connect Wallet to UNiswap shows my assets, but stays on a \"connecting\" wheel during it's swap initializing.\n\n\\-is something broken or blocked on my CB wallet that I'm not getting notification about?\n\n\\-did I buy a one way ticket into an unsaleable \"dollar coin\"  what is this stuff?\n\n   I appreciate the PMs with hyperlinks to extensions that will solve my problems, but I have to assume that legitimate feedback would come in the public comments and not PM",

I don't think there's a way to adjust in the android app.  In the chrome extension you can open transaction history, see stalled transactions, and hit a lightning bolt icon next to them to \"speed them up\"...by paying a bit more.  That was the key to moving my unsupported \"dollar coins\" to uniswap and finally unloading em!!!  \nStay well Fam!",

The  android wallet app is sparse and issues are better solved in chrome extension.  \nMistaking \"Dollar Coin\" for the US Dollars in the app (or any other stable coin)  Was my mistake.  It cost me thousands.  Crypto is a dangerous and volatile place.  The USDx was one of the first auto generated swaps for my USDT in the wallet.  It is not supported by coinbase, and it looks like it can't be swapped or sold in the CB wallet.  Only bought.  As you develop your product, I wonder if you can work towards a tiered system or warning for coin purchases that are irreversible one way streets.  I can see how a wallet may offer more buy options than swappable or saleable coins,  but some descriptive info would be nice for us Luddites!   \nThank you, Good day!",
