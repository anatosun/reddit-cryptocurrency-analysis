            "selftext": "Hello, I am living in france where the total cost of university is 500\u20ac. I was planning on studying computer science, but I see my bitcoin holdings erode little by little as time passes because of necessary purchases. If I go to college I assume my parents would be able to pay for my food and appartment rent but I am worried they ask me to pay it with my own money, have less money to give me because of the devaluation of their wages with inflation or I could simply need to spend my bitcoin to buy other necessary things on my own thus loosing a huge portion of my btc.\n\nAlso I see the price of bitcoin that low and the possible bear market so to me it looks like a huge opportunity to buy since I am bullish long-term and think we will hit at least 140.000 USD per coin in 3 years. So working and saving most of my income in bitcoin could generate a lot.\n\nSo in your opinion is it a good idea to work and maybe self-study or get a degree later rather than missing that bitcoin opportunity and maybe loose some and starting university right now ? I am 19 yo\n\nEdit: I will do uni for a year at least and try to find a job on the side, thank you for your comments !",

For me college provided the framework and connections to do that. However, I realize that's not the only way. That said, my years in college were a hell of a lot of fun and I wouldn't have done it differently. Also, buy bitcoin. Perhaps just a little now and then more when you have a steady income.",

Also, if you're good, no one will care about where you studied, I think this is kinda unique in computer science.\n\nHaving said that, I think university provides a huge value. You will meet a lot of different, interesting people, you will be surrounded with smart, creative, and awesome people, all in the same place. You will have access to professors who might be able to guide and help you, even after you graduate. You will have access to a great community, you will be pushed to learn more, etc. Also, in extreme cases, having a degree will help you, for example if you're planning to move abroad and you need to apply for a visa, certain countries value more your application if you have a degree, and of course it's socially much better appreciated than not having it.\n\nIf I were you I would at least go to college for a year, and see how it goes. And focus on the people and experiences, not that much in the lessons, since you can learn that by yourself at any time.\n\nBitcoin is money in the end, so just get a part time job if you really want to invest and buy a bit with the money you get. Also, try working for Bitcoin directly, help your mates at college and ask for a few sats.",

Overall, Bitcoin will probably win at four years. Zoom out to ten years though and I\u2019d wager that the CS degree + Bitcoin would be FAR more interesting and lucrative. \n\nIf you\u2019re 19 and into Bitcoin and comp sci, you\u2019re likely going to do pretty well Financially. The people, projects, and opportunities you\u2019re exposed to are only expanded by getting the degree.\n\nWhatever your choice, good luck and have fun with it!",

( If you want to get ahead academically )\n\nCollege and university are potentially good if you want to find new relationships.\n\nPersonally , I think its a scam at it's finest and my ego is way to bloated to give them any satisfaction, they literally teach you worst than reading the teaching book by yourself  ! You learn how to listen and apply silly tricks , not how to think !  Get some free education , buy bitcoin and get laid next halving !\n\nEdit: That's what I would **personally** do, don't take this as financial advice for bitcoin , bitcoin could literally go to 0 or \u221e!",

I understand that you feel you can make this decision because you're 19. but you're not mature enough to take such an extensive decision (your answers sound like from a teenager, which you still are). please, don't.\n\nbut assume for a moment it's all about money.\nask yourself, how much BTC you have. If you have like 5 BTC you can study and keep enough for the future. No question.\nIf you have 1 BTC, this might be enough to live off in the future. maybe. If you have less than 1 BTC, there is no discussion either.\nIf it is about working and buying BTC on from now, please consider, that without education you earn most likely minimum wage. you can study and work a student job and have not far less. I did that as well.\nand take into account, that it is likely that you increase your earnings with a better education far more than without. today, 28k\u20ac looks like a huge amount, but it will be a similar effort for you to buy 1 BTC with savings from minimum wage (because you need up to 100% for a living) at this price as it will be at 80k\u20ac salery and BTC at 100k\u20ac. with a masters or bachelors degree, you can earn 2x or 3x or even more than without. over the next 45 years, this could be a difference of >2.000.000\u20ac!\nit will have an impact on your social live as well.\nbut this goes too far.\nplease do your future self a favor and go to university!",

Bitcoin will still be here, maybe get a side job and DCA while you\u2019re going to school, but Bitcoin isn\u2019t a free ticket to riches. You need a solid foundation of marketable skills and the power to earn and stack sats. Go get your computer science education for 500 euro lol that is a huge bargain compared to the six figure USD debt most are getting into in the US \ud83e\udde1",

Don\u2019t waste your time on social sciences, and especially not on nonsense like gender studies or art or something. In the computer world, you don\u2019t need a degree. You can take online courses and get certified in certain programming languages for far less than a uni degree. If you\u2019re interested in pen testing, coding, or computer science generally, you don\u2019t need to go to university and spend $100,000+ for four years of studies. You can spend $1k-$5k online at your own pace to really master coding or pen testing and you\u2019ll be able to earn as much as most people with degrees, if not more. \n\nUniversity used to be the barrier to entry into a \u2018successful\u2019 middle class life for most people. Society is changing though, and university is heavily overpriced and is more focused on political activism than learning. Many employers, myself included, prefer to hire based on skills, not education. Ultimately, it\u2019s up to you though, so dyor and think it through.",

Just make sure that you\u2019re aware that your experience there will not guarantee any level of success. Use it as a chance to make friends and enjoy new social experiences by all means, but be aware that the window of youth closes far more quickly than you might think, and you should also do your best to learn as much as possible (in addition to your formal education I mean). My advice is to not waste your time trying to be popular or fit in. Instead, find a group of interesting and talented people, and befriend / learn from them. Anyways, good luck kid, I wish you nothing but success!",
