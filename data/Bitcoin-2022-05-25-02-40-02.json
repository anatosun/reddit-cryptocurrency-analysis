            "selftext": "Hello, I am living in france where the total cost of university is 500\u20ac. I was planning on studying computer science, but I see my bitcoin holdings erode little by little as time passes because of necessary purchases. If I go to college I assume my parents would be able to pay for my food and appartment rent but I am worried they ask me to pay it with my own money, have less money to give me because of the devaluation of their wages with inflation or I could simply need to spend my bitcoin to buy other necessary things on my own thus loosing a huge portion of my btc.\n\nAlso I see the price of bitcoin that low and the possible bear market so to me it looks like a huge opportunity to buy since I am bullish long-term and think we will hit at least 140.000 USD per coin in 3 years. So working and saving most of my income in bitcoin could generate a lot.\n\nSo in your opinion is it a good idea to work and maybe self-study or get a degree later rather than missing that bitcoin opportunity and maybe loose some and starting university right now ? I am 19 yo\n\nEdit: I will do uni for a year at least and try to find a job on the side, thank you for your comments !",

Also, if you're good, no one will care about where you studied, I think this is kinda unique in computer science.\n\nHaving said that, I think university provides a huge value. You will meet a lot of different, interesting people, you will be surrounded with smart, creative, and awesome people, all in the same place. You will have access to professors who might be able to guide and help you, even after you graduate. You will have access to a great community, you will be pushed to learn more, etc. Also, in extreme cases, having a degree will help you, for example if you're planning to move abroad and you need to apply for a visa, certain countries value more your application if you have a degree, and of course it's socially much better appreciated than not having it.\n\nIf I were you I would at least go to college for a year, and see how it goes. And focus on the people and experiences, not that much in the lessons, since you can learn that by yourself at any time.\n\nBitcoin is money in the end, so just get a part time job if you really want to invest and buy a bit with the money you get. Also, try working for Bitcoin directly, help your mates at college and ask for a few sats.",

For me college provided the framework and connections to do that. However, I realize that's not the only way. That said, my years in college were a hell of a lot of fun and I wouldn't have done it differently. Also, buy bitcoin. Perhaps just a little now and then more when you have a steady income.",

Overall, Bitcoin will probably win at four years. Zoom out to ten years though and I\u2019d wager that the CS degree + Bitcoin would be FAR more interesting and lucrative. \n\nIf you\u2019re 19 and into Bitcoin and comp sci, you\u2019re likely going to do pretty well Financially. The people, projects, and opportunities you\u2019re exposed to are only expanded by getting the degree.\n\nWhatever your choice, good luck and have fun with it!",

If you have like 5 BTC you can study and keep enough for the future. No question.\nIf you have 1 BTC, this might be enough to live off in the future. maybe. If you have less than 1 BTC, there is no discussion either.\nIf it is about working and buying BTC on from now, please consider, that without education you earn most likely minimum wage. you can study and work a student job and have not far less. I did that as well.\nand take into account, that it is likely that you increase your earnings with a better education far more than without. today, 28k\u20ac looks like a huge amount, but it will be a similar effort for you to buy 1 BTC with savings from minimum wage (because you need up to 100% for a living) at this price as it will be at 80k\u20ac salery and BTC at 100k\u20ac. with a masters or bachelors degree, you can earn 2x or 3x or even more than without. over the next 45 years, this could be a difference of >2.000.000\u20ac!\nit will have an impact on your social live as well.\nbut this goes too far.\nplease do your future self a favor and go to university!",
