Not saying that was the only cause of an increase in value but even with DOGE\u2019s growth in the first 7years it still remained sub .01. That first pop to .07 was likely completely organic with some being FOMO since clearly a huge number of people had positions already but after that I feel like it rode the hype and road the influx of cash from stimulus - which is unfortunately dead right now. \n\nI just feel that MOST of your casual retail investors in both crypto and stocks don\u2019t yet consider DOGE a currency (although I understand that is the goal). Until it is adopted everywhere new retail will always convert back to USD for rent, mortgage, groceries, all necessities in general. \n\nHowever I do think your time range is MUCH longer term than most so for that reason I do agree with you.",
