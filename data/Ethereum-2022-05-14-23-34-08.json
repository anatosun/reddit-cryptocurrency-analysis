A lot of people know that it will definitely drive consumption WAY lower, but not many realize that this means Ethereum is going one step forward towards attaining mainstream status.\n\nAside from the fact that retail companies are pushing all in for eco-friendliness, these companies can\u2019t operate on Ethereum as long as it's PoW.\n\nOf course, we still need to wait for sharding for Ethereum to actually start showing its real efficiency, but there are already enough scaling solutions to compensate for that in my opinion.\n\nThese scaling solutions and L2s aren\u2019t playing. Polygon alone has already partnered with so many mainstream traditional companies like Ernst & Young, Dolce & Gabbana, Twitter, Instagram and most importantly Stripe which is a BIG step for crypto as a whole considering Stripe is the 6th largest Fintech company in the world and the 5th most used payment app in the US.\n\nAnd the fact that this company is using Ethereum (even if it\u2019s through an EVM chain like Polygon) insights a lot of hope that Ethereum is on the right path toward mainstream adoption.",

You can look at this two ways - either social ills are avoided but the people still feel free, or the people's freedoms are violated by proxy. There's an argument for each of these but it's really somewhere in the middle.\n\nIn a P2P environment you can only enforce it by draconian controls over individuals.

The mainstream not only won't care, they might not even be aware of the nature of mining.\n\nCrypto needs to be as easy as sending money to each other as services like Venmo and Zelle, without fear you might accidentally lose all your money.

So individual users on L2 will get to pay very little fees (like a hundredth of a penny kind of cheap) while still getting L1's underlying security guarantees.\n\nAnd getting slightly pedantic here, it's not really about *shards* anyone, in that the idea of \"several blockchains running in parallel\" isn't accurate anymore.

They did have to throw out the old execution sharding plan and start over again, but the new data availability sharding is, comparatively, a *much* simpler plan that won't take as long in absolute terms.\n\nData availability sharding is currently planned to roll out in two phases: proto-danksharding and danksharding.\n\nProto-danksharding basically gets the \"front end\" of the new data availability sharding model implemented, but will use the beacon chain (the PoS consensus chain) as the \"back end\", rather than actual shards. This should allow L2s to get themselves ready for when the actual shards come online, and should help partially reduce their operating costs and by extension user fees, but it won't be as big of a reduction, as shards haven't actually come online yet.\n\nDanksharding will keep the \"front end\" introduced by proto-danksharding, but will replace the \"back end\" of proto-danksharding with actual shards, bringing the massive L2 operating cost and user fee reduction in, without needing L2s to do much to support it.\n\nThey're currently looking at launching proto-danksharding with the Shanghai hard fork (the next upgrade following the merge, which should be around 6-12 months after), but it may be pushed back if something prevents it from launching. Danksharding isn't expected to launch until a year or more following the merge, as they're still doing some research on how to best implement and launch it.",

I think there are better chains (even matic) to trust your assets with but that's just my opinion. Solana is cheap for a reason, to pay back VCs.

By the time you have built enough solar panels, windmills and batteries to produce as much reliable energy as coal and oil you have emitted MORE greenhouse gasses than if you would have just used coal and oil directly",

That, or maybe...\n\nWikipedia is a place that brings all sorts of sources together in an easy place. I  wasn't writing a fucking research paper, I was trying to inform someone that I thought was genuinely interested in learning something.\n\nIf I were to write a fucking essay about it, what I would do is what I always did in college: **scroll down to the \"References\" section** of the wiki page and find the **primary sources** that are being cited for every argument and statement made on that wiki page. Becuase that's how Wikipedia works. Stop repeating boomer talking points when someone shows you something you don't like.\n\nAnd this is literally the longest list of sources I have ever seen on a wiki page... weird how that works isn't it? Almost like it's the most widely studied topic in the history of science:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change#References\n\nImagine denying the existence of climate change, in 2022, and your argument is \"lol you tried to use Wikipedia as a source\". Clown.\n\nThat's what I get for giving someone the benefit of the doubt on reddit.\n\nFuck you.",

USDC is backed up by investors with pockets to the tunes of hundreds of billions. In other words, you can't pull the same trick on them they pulled on Terra/Luna, because they're not bullshitting the world the way Do Kwon was with Luna.\n\nUltimately, ETH is not a stablecoin that you can depeg, thereby destroying its business. To prove ETH invalid, you'd have to take control of the blockchain and vote to change things unilaterally. To do so would involve orders of magnitude more capital than the LUNA attack, and without the LUNA/Terra exchange feature to exploit, the cost of attacking the network increases exponentially because you drive the price of the asset *up* as you attack it.\n\nAlso, unlike most layer ones, it's 8 years old and its ownership is spread out. It's concentrated among the rich like everything, but it's also not a chain with lots of VCs holding vested tokens they can't sell yet.",

His vision is for Ethereum to be able to solve real world problems and eventually, down the line, make decentralization the norm and end the tyranny of centralized authorities over our lives. I know this may sound a bit \u201cpoetic\u201d right now but this is the real long term vision.\n\nThis is exactly why I love to see that there are indeed a select few projects that have been following this vision, a lot of which are DAOs which fits great with Vitalik's ideals. There are DAOs out there like BitDAO aiding this vision with more than $500 million ETH in their treasury being allocated toward expanding the DeFi space on Ethereum and improving its adoption rates. Crazy to think that a DAO is the 43rd largest ETH holder meaning that they truly do believe in the long term vision of Ethereum.\n\nHopefully we keep seeing more resources being allocated toward the utilitarian side of Ethereum cause this is the only way to prove that crypto will indeed solve everyday problems and make life all the better. All these billions of dollars combined can be put into much better use. But that's just my (and Vitalik's) personal opinion.",

You can't draw on the bathroom wall of the yacht club unless you have one. You can't get into certain areas without a pass, a certificate. \n\nA lot of people point out that NFTs don't actually reference the image in the NFT, but just a URL that supposedly links to a live server hosting that image. They say the URL could 404 at any time. Lets say that happened to BAYC. I don't think the NFTs would lose a single cent in value if that happened. It's not about the picture.",

The damn jpegs are a bit annoying, but hopefully we will see a big expansion into music and videos/movies. A DAO similar to YouTube/Twitch would be cool, but still not truly impactful on a large scale IMO. NFT\u2019s for supply chain, real estate, medical records, or to develop a digital identity that can be verified but still private. I see value on some of those as they could have some real impact down the line especially in countries were fraud/scamming is prevalent. I definitely think this is just the top of the iceberg of what this of technology has the potential to do, but I feel like there\u2019s still a large percentage of the population that don\u2019t fully understand it or are limited by regulations. I feel like NFT\u2019s are just well simple and easy to get with a few minutes of explanation. I\u2019d like to see a social media platform be created where there is little advertisements/propaganda and no algorithm creating echo chambers, actually improving discourse over meaningful topics. That has more value to me than just seeing a bunch of content that confirms your mindset/feed ego\u2019s as it limits personal growth which could be impactful on a large scale especially when you\u2019re seeing a wider variety of content you\u2019ve never thought/heard about. Honestly the current downside with crypto in general is the best tech is never valued or utilized to it\u2019s potential it seems and what gets all the hype is whatever is pushed in the media or what can make individuals fast money. I see decentralization as a way to improve the distribution of resources not just money so that every kid with dreams who wants to create/build outside their immediate means had a concrete avenue to do so, ideally uplifting everyone on a global scale, limiting inefficiency, and spurring innovation for all humans. Ofc it\u2019s not that simple but one can dream.",

For years he's basically just been a part of the R&D team, most of which are obscure figures who contribute just as much if not more than him to actual core protocol spec and research.\n\nYeah if anyone is unironically worshipping him (i see a lot of jokes, that I hope are jokes) that's super stupid but there is definitely no meaningful similarities between Do Kwon and Vitalik, they really are in a different world when it comes to vision, goals, and just overall attitude.",

A place in hopes to dump your bags to someone a bigger fool than yourself for some profits. \n\n99.9% of people are here for the speculative gambling in hopes of becoming rich overnight.
