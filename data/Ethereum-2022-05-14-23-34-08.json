            "selftext": "Some people are really underestimating what this merge means exactly. A lot of people know that it will definitely drive consumption WAY lower, but not many realize that this means Ethereum is going one step forward towards attaining mainstream status.\n\nAside from the fact that retail companies are pushing all in for eco-friendliness, these companies can\u2019t operate on Ethereum as long as it's PoW.\n\nOf course, we still need to wait for sharding for Ethereum to actually start showing its real efficiency, but there are already enough scaling solutions to compensate for that in my opinion.\n\nThese scaling solutions and L2s aren\u2019t playing. Polygon alone has already partnered with so many mainstream traditional companies like Ernst & Young, Dolce & Gabbana, Twitter, Instagram and most importantly Stripe which is a BIG step for crypto as a whole considering Stripe is the 6th largest Fintech company in the world and the 5th most used payment app in the US.\n\nAnd the fact that this company is using Ethereum (even if it\u2019s through an EVM chain like Polygon) insights a lot of hope that Ethereum is on the right path toward mainstream adoption.",

However, I am against the HUGE amounts of resources that are being poured in the NFT market. Resources that will not result in anything of real utility or impact in the real world.\n\nVitalik\u2019s vision is for Ethereum to be the portal which people will use to integrate themselves and their lifestyle into the digital world. His vision is for Ethereum to be able to solve real world problems and eventually, down the line, make decentralization the norm and end the tyranny of centralized authorities over our lives. I know this may sound a bit \u201cpoetic\u201d right now but this is the real long term vision.\n\nThis is exactly why I love to see that there are indeed a select few projects that have been following this vision, a lot of which are DAOs which fits great with Vitalik's ideals. There are DAOs out there like BitDAO aiding this vision with more than $500 million ETH in their treasury being allocated toward expanding the DeFi space on Ethereum and improving its adoption rates. Crazy to think that a DAO is the 43rd largest ETH holder meaning that they truly do believe in the long term vision of Ethereum.\n\nHopefully we keep seeing more resources being allocated toward the utilitarian side of Ethereum cause this is the only way to prove that crypto will indeed solve everyday problems and make life all the better. All these billions of dollars combined can be put into much better use. But that's just my (and Vitalik's) personal opinion.",
