            "selftext": "I\u2019m not against NFT art, after all its another integral part of the Ethereum ecosystem. However, I am against the HUGE amounts of resources that are being poured in the NFT market. Resources that will not result in anything of real utility or impact in the real world.\n\nVitalik\u2019s vision is for Ethereum to be the portal which people will use to integrate themselves and their lifestyle into the digital world. His vision is for Ethereum to be able to solve real world problems and eventually, down the line, make decentralization the norm and end the tyranny of centralized authorities over our lives. I know this may sound a bit \u201cpoetic\u201d right now but this is the real long term vision.\n\nThis is exactly why I love to see that there are indeed a select few projects that have been following this vision, a lot of which are DAOs which fits great with Vitalik's ideals. There are DAOs out there like BitDAO aiding this vision with more than $500 million ETH in their treasury being allocated toward expanding the DeFi space on Ethereum and improving its adoption rates. Crazy to think that a DAO is the 43rd largest ETH holder meaning that they truly do believe in the long term vision of Ethereum.\n\nHopefully we keep seeing more resources being allocated toward the utilitarian side of Ethereum cause this is the only way to prove that crypto will indeed solve everyday problems and make life all the better. All these billions of dollars combined can be put into much better use. But that's just my (and Vitalik's) personal opinion.",

Polygon alone has already partnered with so many mainstream traditional companies like Ernst & Young, Dolce & Gabbana, Twitter, Instagram and most importantly Stripe which is a BIG step for crypto as a whole considering Stripe is the 6th largest Fintech company in the world and the 5th most used payment app in the US.\n\nAnd the fact that this company is using Ethereum (even if it\u2019s through an EVM chain like Polygon) insights a lot of hope that Ethereum is on the right path toward mainstream adoption.",

If states want to prevent people from having fiat-crypto transfers, they'd need to forbid all types of bank transfers that exist, aka literally shut down their own banking networks. \n\nAfter all, we already have decentralized fiat-crypto exchanges using peer-to-peer transfers.\n\nBesides, it would require collusion between all states to actually work. It's the same setup of Prisoner's dilemma than the one that ensured Bitcoin worked in the first place. If states can pull that one, they'd disprove the Prisoner's dilemma conclusions.

They enforce it by demanding that shops get a license to sell booze, and they punish businesses that don't check ID.\n\nThe license application process means that can also put more tax on these products, they can refuse to give licenses to the \"wrong\" people, stores that open too late or are in the wrong location. You can look at this two ways - either social ills are avoided but the people still feel free, or the people's freedoms are violated by proxy. There's an argument for each of these but it's really somewhere in the middle.\n\nIn a P2P environment you can only enforce it by draconian controls over individuals. Make everyone report all their financial transactions, look in every parcel for contraband and have steep punishments for lawbreakers. Without structural oppression you need direct oppression of individuals to have the same levels of control.",

You don't really need to keep your tokens in the CeFi for this kind of operations, so trust requirements are way lower than when it's to keep your funds in long term custody.

Binance too (maybe not the same L2). They're both quite big. \n\nThe only thing you'd probably have to worry about is regarding your ability to justify your source of funds, if it's for lots of money.

If you insist on continuing to do your swaps on Layer 1, you will still pay high fees from that main execution chain being just as congested as today if not more.\n\nRollups on the other hand will be able to use the cheap data provided by layer 1 to securely batch transactions for very little costs, spread out over many many users. So individual users on L2 will get to pay very little fees (like a hundredth of a penny kind of cheap) while still getting L1's underlying security guarantees.\n\nAnd getting slightly pedantic here, it's not really about *shards* anyone, in that the idea of \"several blockchains running in parallel\" isn't accurate anymore. It's just the one blockchain with data blobs that only a subset of validators have to store and provide, with data availability sampling keeping them in check to make sure the data is truly available.

They did have to throw out the old execution sharding plan and start over again, but the new data availability sharding is, comparatively, a *much* simpler plan that won't take as long in absolute terms.\n\nData availability sharding is currently planned to roll out in two phases: proto-danksharding and danksharding.\n\nProto-danksharding basically gets the \"front end\" of the new data availability sharding model implemented, but will use the beacon chain (the PoS consensus chain) as the \"back end\", rather than actual shards. This should allow L2s to get themselves ready for when the actual shards come online, and should help partially reduce their operating costs and by extension user fees, but it won't be as big of a reduction, as shards haven't actually come online yet.\n\nDanksharding will keep the \"front end\" introduced by proto-danksharding, but will replace the \"back end\" of proto-danksharding with actual shards, bringing the massive L2 operating cost and user fee reduction in, without needing L2s to do much to support it.\n\nThey're currently looking at launching proto-danksharding with the Shanghai hard fork (the next upgrade following the merge, which should be around 6-12 months after), but it may be pushed back if something prevents it from launching. Danksharding isn't expected to launch until a year or more following the merge, as they're still doing some research on how to best implement and launch it.",

I think there are better chains (even matic) to trust your assets with but that's just my opinion. Solana is cheap for a reason, to pay back VCs.

If I say ANYTHING is fraud they refund me.  Also I have what is called FDIC insurance with my bank and that helps too.  Oh yeah best of all I never have any transaction fees or failed transaction fees.  Also USD is pretty damn stable.  You should check it out.",

There are DAO\u2019s that will change the world.\n\nDAO\u2019s bring the tools that we need to combat climate change for example, but any public good can be achieved through DAO\u2019s.\n\nSpeaking of public goods.. Quadratic funding will change the way we can vote with our money. Look at gitcoin grants. Sure, they are mostly focused on funding blockchain related narratives, but that will likely expand to other sectors. For example; Maybe we can finally finance a continuation of firefly..\n\nPasswords will be a thing of the past once wallet tooling improves. Just sign in with ethereum.\n\nTokenization has HUGE potential for things like supply chain tracking, digital ownership, rights management.\n\nThere is tons of things to look forward to, which is the reason why that post is getting downvoted.",

Not sure if what happened to Luna was direct effect of something sketchy happening with UST.\n\nWhile I understand that the basic principle of crypto is to only invest what you can afford to lose, it is still horrifying, the thought of an investment being wiped out overnight.\n\nMy question and please ELI5 is, can this happen to Ethereum? And this may be a very complex answer but I'm trying to have a conversation.\n\nTIA.",

USDC is backed up by investors with pockets to the tunes of hundreds of billions. In other words, you can't pull the same trick on them they pulled on Terra/Luna, because they're not bullshitting the world the way Do Kwon was with Luna.\n\nUltimately, ETH is not a stablecoin that you can depeg, thereby destroying its business. To prove ETH invalid, you'd have to take control of the blockchain and vote to change things unilaterally. To do so would involve orders of magnitude more capital than the LUNA attack, and without the LUNA/Terra exchange feature to exploit, the cost of attacking the network increases exponentially because you drive the price of the asset *up* as you attack it.\n\nAlso, unlike most layer ones, it's 8 years old and its ownership is spread out. It's concentrated among the rich like everything, but it's also not a chain with lots of VCs holding vested tokens they can't sell yet.",

The odds currently say that if you win your bet you'll get back 20% more than what you put up. If you place your bet in Ether, that Ether is going to sit in the prediction market for a year before it comes back to you. In that time Ether's likely to have changed its value dramatically. Maybe it's gone up, maybe it's gone down. Regardless, the value of the payout is going to be almost completely disconnected from what those odds were.\n\nOr, let's say that a data storage dapp akin to Swarm is developed that lets you create a contract that pays cloud storage providers to keep your data online. You want your data to be available for twenty years, and are willing to pay a hundred dollars a year over that period. If you use Ether for that then who knows what's going to be going on twenty years from now? Your contract might be only paying the equivalent of a pittance (in installments of 1/20th of a pittance), resulting in your data being lost. Or it could be paying the equivalent of a million dollars a year to ensure that your NFTs of interesting-looking twigs are accessible.\n\nIn a nutshell, stablecoins let you put value into a contract and let the contract hold that value without it changing much.

But basically if after the merge people keep withdrawing their stake, and if the price of ETH drops low enough, they may be forced to increase the amount of ETH stakers earn, to keep them staked and/or attract new ones.

If ether or dollars fail, they will do so in a completely different way than luna did.
