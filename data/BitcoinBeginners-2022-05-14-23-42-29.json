            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI've dabbled in BTC as early as 2013 and haven't touched it since 2014 (I sold pretty much all my positions way early), and am looking to get back in again.\n\nSince then, it looks like the regulatory hammer has come down hard in New York, and exchanges that accept gift card based methods like Coinmama, CEX.io don't appear to be operational in New York.  Only options I've found are localbitcoins and paxful, but most of the offers seem sketchy at best since I have no recourse once the codes are sent over.\n\nI have no issue with KYC and providing info - just looking for a quality exchange to work with to liquidate my Visa / MC Gift cards and exchange them for Crypto.\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated - thanks in advance!",
