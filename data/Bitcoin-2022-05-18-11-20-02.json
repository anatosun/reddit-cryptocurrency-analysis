It's a side project so I don't really need the money that it generates.\n\nRight now I'm using [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-gb-pt) for payments. Stripe will hold my euros until I withdraw them into my bank account. Then from my bank I change my euros to Bitcoin.\n\nI wanna get rid of the middle man (the bank) and change the euros straight to Bitcoin with my payment getaway.",

The coins are transferred to your own address. In the process of the first setup you have to prove ownership of the given address by signing it (with a private key). You can then do normal SEPA transfer or even setup recurring transfers/purchases from the bank account you gave them.",
