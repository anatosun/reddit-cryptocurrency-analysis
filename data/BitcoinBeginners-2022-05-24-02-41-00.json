I continually read the same words on here and they mean absolutely nothing to me (i.e blockchain, ledger, digital mining). Googling just yields definitions containing more words that mean nothing to me. Where would you tell your grandparents to go if they were curious? There are others like me: 45 yr olds and up with zero computer literacy but genuine curiosity.",
