I continually read the same words on here and they mean absolutely nothing to me (i.e blockchain, ledger, digital mining). Googling just yields definitions containing more words that mean nothing to me. Where would you tell your grandparents to go if they were curious? There are others like me: 45 yr olds and up with zero computer literacy but genuine curiosity.",

The ledger is just the recording of who owns how much bitcoin. Bitcoin has one singular ledger, distributed among all network participants. \n\nA block is a pack of transactions that updates the ledger. Blocks are produced roughly every 10 minutes, and each is linked sequentially to the previous block, creating a chain. Blockchain.\n\nDigital mining is how it's determined who gets to make the next block. How it works is somewhat technical and not necessary information for the end user (but there are good explainer videos if you want to know).",
