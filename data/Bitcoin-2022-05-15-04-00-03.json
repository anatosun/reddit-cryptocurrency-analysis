It seems like money down the drain, but experimenting and frying a hashboard is less painful when you do it to a garbage miner instead of an $8K investment.  \n\nAlternatively you could get a refurbished S17 for about $2,300 that will actually make a decent coin stack over a month.  Still not the most efficient TH/J but this is an ASIC that requires a 240 electric hook up and really makes noise and heat.  This is the type of machine that is used now. \n\nIf you can survive for the summer without killing your miner, then you can confidently spend big money on a good ASIC. \n\nAs for the comments to \u201cjust buy Bitcoin\u201d there are enormous investments throughout the US in cryptocurrency mining.  Seems like they might know a thing or two.  But that\u2019s my opinion.",
