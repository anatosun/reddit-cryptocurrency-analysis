The chart is not for doge and either way they were implying we\u2019ve hit bottom. Well, for doge bottom is .0 and technically below. We haven\u2019t gotten there yet. I hope we don\u2019t but given current market trend it seems more and more likely doge will plummet below .0. The bigger question which absolutely no one can answer is whether it will come back if btc manages to go up again. Will people continue putting money into fantasy money based on fomo.",
