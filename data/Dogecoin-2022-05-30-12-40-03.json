That is the part that Yahoo the company sold. What was left in Yahoo the company was 100% Alibaba stake. The company renamed itself into Altaba, but then closed shop, because it doesn't make any sense to have a company with zero activity just sitting on Alibaba stock. Another fun fact is that holding Altaba came with a discount; it was cheaper to buy Altaba to get hold of Alibaba stock then to buy Alibaba directly. Lastly, people who kept their Yahoo stock towards the very end got a nice pay-out when Altaba closed shop. In other words, Yahoo shareholders became unwillingly early investors in Alibaba.",
