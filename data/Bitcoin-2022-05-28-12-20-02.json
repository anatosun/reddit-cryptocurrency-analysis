They have a fixed price to attack and they are overwhelmingly premined shitcoins, so those with the premines defacto control what transactions get added.\n\nAdditionally these shitcoin blockchains are so large and unwieldy that they up being / using a data centre to run 'super nodes', so they aren't really decentralised in the first place.

PoW requires a method of changing the block header from one guess to the next. The nonce is very fast to change by incrementing it. But there's no requirement for Bitcoin miners' guesses to be fast  \n\nThe nonce is irrelevant to the question of PoW vs PoS  \n\nWhat you really want to know is how PoS replaces the PoW consensus rules ...  \n\n*    In Bitcoin mining, the winning miner has a block which has a header which has a hash smaller than the current target  \n\n*    The target is recalibrated automatically every 2016 blocks to keep the average block interval close to 10 minutes  \n\nBut don't ask that question here.
