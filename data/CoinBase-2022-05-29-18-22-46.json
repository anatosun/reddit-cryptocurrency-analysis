            "selftext": "[screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/lauNw)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI was double charged (2/14) after making a purchase in early Feb. \nWhen talking with bank rep she stated that people have been calling all day because of double charges by CB.  CB (via news) said it was visa.  Doesn't matter, had double charge reversed and the original left untouched.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nContinued to use cb/gdax w no problems.  a month later I got an email stating that the 2x charge was reversed by the bank (**correctly** from 2/14) and that I owe the money to CB.  I immediately logged into Coinbase and my buys/sells were disabled until I pay the duplicate charge made by cb/visa.  tried to check gdax and can\u2019t login- sign in error.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDecided I should just paid the double charge as I wanted to try and move the fiat/btc off gdax (see sunk cost fallacy).  after paying cb buys/sells remained locked until the next day.  after that my buys are still disabled and I can\u2019t access gdax- same sign in error.  sells/history/etc. I can access but in no way do I plan to test if sells actually work.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI still have no access to the exchange and closing CB won\u2019t give me access to gdax funds as it says all wallets are empty.  I\u2019ve submitted requests on both gdax and CB and got an email w no support ticket # and response that seems unsure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nluckily, I wasn\u2019t comfortable using gdax/cb for large amounts (*yet*, now never).  anyone who has read this and hasn\u2019t had problems, look at all the other complaints about no support and stolen/lost fiat/coins.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*will update if further communication/resolution is made with 'support' and/or visa/bank*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*updates:*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n3/25-\n\ncopy/paste [support email #2](https://imgur.com/a/5ncUH) not addressing actual message/issue.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n4/20-\n\ngot [support email #3](https://imgur.com/a/JHGgDhJ) directly addressing issue, unlocking both my gdax/cb accounts, and confirming refund/resolution.  Pending the refund, the entire issue will have been resolved honestly.  *\"Honestly\"* meaning my accounts were unlocked, my funds untouched, and the refund pending.  The most ideal resolution possible*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Aside from: the time it took, the automated problem that caused the double charges in the first place, and CB support seeminly overwhelmed.  (also temp loss of funds and any ripple effect that may have but also time invested in support emails, proof, and even posting here.)  It may seem half full but a long drawn out support ticket with me losing nothing but a little time is better than a happy quick ticket saying you're SOL.  It would be nice to have best of both though.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nsidenote: the pending buy order was filled correctly with no discrepancy in balance (it seems that regardless of locked gdax account the funds stayed attached to my account, even being converted).",
