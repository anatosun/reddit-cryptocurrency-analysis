You bought in at more or less the peak\n\n>I reinvested, like everyone else\n\nDon't get swept up in the hype. There's a lot of people saying they're buying the dip, but in reality, nobody knows how far the dip will go. This is the reason why so many people lose money in the stock market, and it's the same reason why people lose money in crypto. Always take a step back and assess the situation\n\n>doge-one satellite and hoping it brought amazing news with it\n\nBe aware of the phrase \"buy the rumour, sell the news\". A lot of people were expecting doge to spike during SNL. Instead it fell. There will always be someone trying to front-run on certain dates to leave others holding the bag\n\n>At this point it just seems doge was pumped and dumped\n\nYes and no. Doge is, was, and will always be, pumped and dumped. But look at the chart again. Dogecoin has reached a new all time high on a roughly 4 year cycle like bitcoin. The problem is that there will always be someone who will buy when it's cheap, and hype everyone when the price hits the peak in order to leave someone else holding the bag\n\n>im stuck holding bags\n\nA lot of people are. It's up to you if you want to wait for 4 years or so for the next all time high, wait for a rally that won't hit an ATH but is enough to cash out in profit, or cash out your losses. It's a bit of a cold response, but like I said earlier, sometimes you need to take a step back and assess the situation",

But right now, converting to BTC is the best risk/reward decision. When the market recovers, BTC will pump first. So what most people are doing is selling their DOGE for BTC to buy back after we see what the market does. BTC will be the indicator. No point in holding DOGE while waiting to find out, unless you are too attached. Good luck bro.",
