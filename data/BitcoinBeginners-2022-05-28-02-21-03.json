These mnemonics predate BIP 39 and usually encode either a blockchain.info wallet password or a password and uuid. The easiest way to recover them is using blockchain.com's legacy recovery page.\n\n**The biggest problem with this is typing your words into a webpage. Obviously this is extremely ill advised if you have some other mnemonic, so try to make sure this is actually what you have.** Also, typing single words into the recovery page won't work to see if they are on the list, as the mnemonic has a built in checksum that will fail if the phrase is not complete in the right order.\n\nThe recovery page is here: https://login.blockchain.com/wallet/forgot-password",
