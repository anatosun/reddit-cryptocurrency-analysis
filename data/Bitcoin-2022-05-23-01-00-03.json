Sapporo Ichiban is good ramen (original flavor).\n\nGet a big bowl (holds about 4 cups).  \n\nChop leftover meat: one or more: chicken, beef, pork, cooked egg(s)  \n\nThinly slice fresh vegetables: one or more: green cabbage, celery stalk, green onion, brown/sweet onion, raw spinach, carrot, bok choy, mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus tips... I usually use one meat and 2 to 4 vegetables.\n\nPut the vegetables into the bowl while the noodles are cooking, sprinkle the flavor packet over the vegetables in the bowl.  When the noodles are finished, pour the noodles and liquid into the bowl.  Gently stir, with a fork, to dissolve the flavor packet.  Top with meat or eggs.  Enjoy.\n\n[Edit] Try various hot sauces, as you dare.",
