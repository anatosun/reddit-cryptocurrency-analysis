We hope that this work carried out will increase in the short term to continue massifying the use of Bitcoin Cash not only in Venezuela, but in more Latin American countries.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c2jicczmaa191.png?width=1802&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4d9e4a66fb06fee2495cb4a3471d47e5ac3bb5b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7uih8fpoaa191.png?width=1892&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9162e6f85cdb1aa78efafd7cb1293b155226f32\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sxf70lvqaa191.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=f91f0626fc10f2e2a57d7762b496e0d0a38fbf6f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fzxnn8ksaa191.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=352c67839db82a2fccda991781ff0783b45f4ba4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zyi6quwtaa191.png?width=1878&format=png&auto=webp&s=17254289c90eb9b2f87f91e87ca8f4efaec54861\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ex6wp7vaa191.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=266485c3813944c297f17b81c11d786fea047f08\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t9862vmwaa191.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=07bc6a5d8ba3085985114b519d8f3bd7712a4a9b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ikxww58yaa191.png?width=1912&format=png&auto=webp&s=e847ebc003749a120dcb480f9d7e68fa696be5e1",
