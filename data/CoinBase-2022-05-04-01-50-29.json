Please if anyone has any useful advice please post below.\n\nMy latest ticket number:   Case# 11503094    (for coinbase reddit team)\n\n# PLEASE ONLY POST UK LEGAL ADVICE - i already tried to contact coinbase/call them.

            "selftext": "EDIT: I have received the funds in my Coinbase account. Thank you to everyone who helped me with supportive messages and information!\n\nEarly yesterday afternoon I lost 0.0318 BTC sending it from Binance to Coinbase via the BTC network (TxID: *eb2e316abf0ced7e232d2992a6ed74543ba6d2d151c69d3ed77391cfb9b9483f*, to my Coinbase address: *3EvoJcyCJDcyKX77DUXGaSCrwfov1gpKJr*)\n\nAfter speaking to customer support they told me that I should be sending BTC via the ERC20 network which I get NO notification of on either the app or desktop before copying my receiving address. From my call with Coinbase support, they told me this could be a 'minor' bug causing it not to show up and sent me some troubleshooting tips to see the message below my receiving address.\n\nTo further confuse things, I had a successful transaction of 0.008 BTC on 31.03 from Binance to CB via the BTC network! (TxID: *fd47962b573664e0de4bdb623f1ef6dd25d8653b73f6e11171aabfd9811ac77f)*\n\nI'm basically trying to understand if this is my fault, Binance's or CB's, if it is mine then I'll of course learn from it, accept my loss and be on my way.\n\nHowever, I have found other posts on this subreddit from people with the same issue, so I am starting to believe that this is the fault of Coinbase themselves. If you have experienced something similar, please let me know below and mention what progress you have made with their support team.\n\nI am currently waiting for a response from them but will update this post as needed.\n\n*Update 25.04 16:11 -* I got a cookie cutter response from Coinbase with the following nonsensical info:\n\n>*I\u2019ve reviewed the transaction hash provided and it appears the funds were sent on a network not supported by Coinbase. When this happens, we are not able to retrieve these funds because we simply don\u2019t have access to them. If Coinbase decides to list this asset on our platform for this network at a later date, please reach back out to us if your account is not automatically credited with these funds.*\n\nIt's like they aren't listening to my actual issue and just palming it off, causing me to go round in circles.",

I sent over some btc from cdc at 8am this morning,  and in about 30mins got the standard email from coinbase saying I received the funds, and for abrief second it showed up in my coinbase transaction history, but not in actual btc funds, and then it was gone when I refreshed to check the balance again to see if it was lagging.  It shows it was completed in 35minutes according to crypto.com, have hash, addresses all match up, shows complete in explorer  etc, and the email from coinbase echos that.  But no btc actually showed up.  Click on the email from cb to view the transaction and pulls up the little gear animation and it says we are having issues but we assure you your money is safe.  Doesn't seem very fucking safe if I'm unable to access it in any way at all for 7hrs.  This sounds cheesy as shit, but I transferred over some btc for my son's 16th bday today.   And now it's just lost  in  coinbases shite purgatory with zero help. Couldn't even get Bela the customer service to admit this is a giant fucking problem having who knows how many peoples money just frozen in time. Just said they are aware of the issue and I can check the website for updates. At 830this morning there was no listed transfer issues. But I see that's bullshit clearly if some folks have been waiting days.  I always was good with coinbase. Been using for years and years and never had a single issue. It could be worse I suppose, always could be, but I'm surprised it's taking so long to remedy. Im Glad it wasn't a larger sum, but its still annoying to have a few hundo just disappear with a basic ass transfer.",

I immediately saw the transaction appear in the PayPal history, and the amount (200eur) was subtracted from the account total. **The transaction also appears on the CoinbaseCard app as 'pending' (Crypto wallet: USD Wallet, Transaction status: Pending, Transaction Type: pending), but 13 days have passed**! On the other side, there is no trace of it on the 'main' CoinBase app.\n\n**Did any of you had or heard about a similar issue?** Did I do something wrong (maybe you cannot send FIAT money to the CoinBase card? or the fact that PayPal automatically sent Euros to a USD wallet?) **Do I have to ask for a refund, and in case how?**\n\nThank you for your help! I've sent FIAT to my Binance card previously with no issues, so I don't know why the CoinBase card is not behaving similarly. I have no problem sending crypto to my CoinBase account and using it with my card",

            "selftext": "Hello, many of you who have staked Ethereum with Coinbase are probably wondering when the funds will be released.  If you staked more recently then your expectations are that the funds won't be released until the network upgrade is complete, but that wasn't what was initially promised earlier on.  I staked my Ethereum back in September 2021 because Coinbase had promised Eth2 liquidity BEFORE the upgrade as a convenient service to customers, because life happens and who would want to lock up money on an exchange without any kind of roadmap right? (Other exchanges offer this)  When I staked, Coinbase said that Eth2 would be tradeable by the end of the year 2021, and I even have support emails as late as December 15th, 2021 stating the same thing leaving a 2 week window for them to keep their promise.  Last minute,  Coinbase then changed the time frame for Eth2 trading prior to upgrade to be later this year 2022.  Not long after this, the language on Coinbase was changed to say that the funds would be locked until the Eth 2.0 upgrade was complete, no time frame.  Other exchanges do and have been offering trading of staked Ethereum for awhile now, making Coinbase an exception, yet customer service staff claims they are at the mercy of the Ethereum Network.  This claim has many problems.  1. if they were at the mercy of the network this whole time why make promises that it would be tradeable before the upgrade? Especially before the end of 2021? All predictions put the upgrade well beyond this window into q2 2022 and beyond so the assumption that they thought the upgrade was going to be done before 2022 does not apply here. 2. If they were at mercy of the Eth 2.0 upgrade why wouldn't they have said what they are saying now in the first place?  Stating that the funds wouldn't be available until the upgrade would've been more than reasonable, instead of promising liquidity before the upgrade and putting a time frame on it.  If it's not deliberate, then it's very incompetent and has eroded my trust in Coinbase and in such scenarios where a company fails to meet an obligation in an agreement, there needs to be protocols in place to remedy the situation.  Having no plan for liquidity before the upgrade now puts many people in a bad situation especially when it comes to taxes.  If you ask a customer service representative why Coinbase has cancelled their plans to allow staked Ethereum trading before the upgrade, and why other exchanges offer it, they have absolutely no answer except sorry.  When it comes to toying with tens of thousands of dollars, sorry is not a very good answer.  Coinbase at the very least needs to come out and be transparent with why they changed their plans multiple times.  An article by the Motley Fool perfectly outlines this problem regarding eth2 trading and has quotes of Coinbase and their misleading language.  I suggest you all check it out. [Is Coinbase Moving the Goalposts on Your Staked Ethereum? | The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/12/29/is-coinbase-moving-the-goalposts-on-your-staked-et/) Also Coinbase refuses to comment on other customer cases who have been able to unlock staked eth2 that I have found here on reddit.",

The added benefit is that the Authenticator keys aren\u2019t on your phone, they\u2019re on the Yubikey. Your phone app can access the keys, but if you lose your phone, you can just get a new one, download the app and login, then use the Yubikey and everything works perfectly. \n\nIt takes a while to set up if you have lots of keys saved on Google Authenticator or similar, but totally worth it. And get yourself a spare Yubikey. You can set the same codes on that at the same time you set up your primary Yubikey. \n\nYubikey 5 NFC.",

I sort of still don't understand what I did wrong, but here's a simple rundown what happened from what I understand:\n\nI was sent DAI via the Polygon (MATIC) network. This was sent to my coinbase wallet extension. Then I tried to just transfer that DAI from my wallet to coinbase account, so that I could pull it out as cash. Then it was just gone. Coinbase support told me that I sent the crypto from ta network they don't support, so they are unable to do anything about my case. \n\nFirst of all, it seems insane to me that coinbase would allow me to make this incompatible transaction from their product (the wallet) to their other product (the coinbase website). Maybe (probably) I am off base here. But I would assume coinbase has the software engineering capability necessary to output an error message in this kind of situation. \n\nAnyways, they also told me, \"if we\u2019ll ever support the Polygon network for DAI deposits, we\u2019ll be able to recover it.\" \n\nHow likely does it seem that they'll support the Polygon network for DAI deposits anytime soon?",

When typing an amount I want to buy I can't specify exactly as the only numbers available are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Not even a 0. On top of that if the wrong number is pressed we have to back out of the screen and start a new transaction. The only way to get denominations ending in 0 are using the $10, $50 , and $100 options which is annoying making multiple transactions. The last alternative would be to overbuy/underbuy the amount you're looking for but even then its not too easy with numbers missing. Theres no easy way to buy $900 of a coin on mobile. You would have to buy $1111 for one transaction or make 9 $100 transactions or 3 transactions of $666, $111, $111 and $12.\n\nHere is an imgur link for reference: https://imgur.com/a/bI6eSMe",

I have contacted contact several times, only for them to close my tickets without responding. This February they finally sent me some KYC form so I could verify myself, and I did this by uploading paychecks and stating details around my employment status. However, when I did this, nothing has happened for the past 2 months, even though I have contacted them again requesting details on my verification status. I am very dissatisfied with how I am being treated as a customer, and that my funds are currently locked in my account. Has anyone else experienced this - and if so, what did you do to get your account unlocked? Thank you in advance.\n\nSincerely, \n\nTired Coinbase Customer.",

Someone here is already saying \"DM me I can help\" and this is very dodgy behaviour. Others should see this and learn to avoid this like the plague.\n\nFor example, you could elaborate on what \"forced to migrate to wallet\" means. I have never been forced to migrate anything from Coinbase. Who / how /why are you being forced?\n\nWhy can't you get your bitcoins back?\n\nRemember, *no personal info* like name, email, Coinbase case ID / ticket number, account, value, crypto address etc. But a bit more detail on the problem will be helpful for everyone.\n\nDo not DM anybody about these things unless they are 100% Coinbase support (i.e. they have a coinbase work email address AND it's come through Coinbase support platform)",

I didn't even know someone was able to access my account until coinbase sent a failed purchase of 10k in bitcoin.  I believe the hacker sold 2k of MATIC and a little more than 6k of ADA and transferred to a new linked u/chime account.  (I'm trying to get in contact with chime as well because someone might have stole my identity there, I've never used chime before).Very suspicious things here with coinbase:\n\n1. I looked into activity of coinbase account and there was a web session from vpn ip from austria.\n2. Coinbase did not send any emails /notifications for Austria ip /new device.\n3. You have a max daily withdrawal limit and I checked it was 0 out of the max.\n4. I didn't get any notifications from coinbase for linking new payments/banks, selling coins, or transferring funds out .\n5. They're doing everything they can to blame me when they can't prove to me it's my problem when I followed all the security to the T and I have my phone, where the google auth app is on, the whole time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow they're saying \"we escalated\", but I'm not sure if it's going anywhere.\n\nEDIT 1:I don't believe coinbase is looking into this at all.  I'm insisting them to give me the information on the bank accounts that were linked to my coinbase account, and they just keep ignoring that request.Is it possible that there's a breach on coinbase and they're not telling us ? Just so they don't have to pay the users back on the stolen funds ?\n\nEdit 2:No I didn't have whitelist on because I didn't know.  Yes, call me dumb or whatever, obviously we can always do better on security practices. That's not the point of the thread.To the ones, \"that's no the whole story\", well it is, am I asking for donations or anything like that ? what? so I'm here to post so I can feel better ? Do you really think \"oh that sucks\" from strangers online makes up for losing 10k ?After 5 email replies back and forth with coinbase, they're not giving me any previous added bank information. They kept saying \"just go here and generate a report\", which I've done.  There are 0 information about bank account numbers or anything like that. Unless I'm just that blind, then please point me towards the right direction.Coinbase support is so trash, in the middle of trying to figure out what's the bank account funds went to so I can send a better report to police or fbi, they random goes back to first step of \"we would suggest you to reset your password\".  I'm not sure how difficult it is to help me find out where the funds were withdrawal to since they didn't transfer to a wallet.  \n\n\nEdit 3:   \nIf everything goes well, this might be my 2nd to last update.  Crazy shit happened, I don't know if this is true or not.  So the hacker had linked their account to my profile, I did try to just deposit back and no luck at all that day (last week) and the transactions showed \"canceled\" (Most likely they just moved them to another account quickly).  Literally JUST NOW, I was on my phone, I never unlinked the account and told myself. . \"why not?\" I FUCKING DEPOSITED MONEY !  I did 10k and was wondering if it's a bug ? Then I tried again with 5k and they both show \"completed\" and not \"canceled\" ! WTF HOLY. . .I have my fingers crossed and hoping this is all true.  ",

            "selftext": "**New Coinbase customer**\n\nI recently joined Coinbase. Send in ID and livepicture. They were approved as good.\n\nI added Sepa method. Then I Transferred money to Coinbase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update 15th of April**\n\n**Since my account has no security or identification issues, it must be unrestricted at your earliest convenience. Should I not get a response/ manual positive review by Coinbase, compensation for my loss at the hands of coinbase and a successfully unrestricted account within 72 hours, I  will be forced to lodge a formal complaint with the SEC and the CFPB.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Transaction delay**\n\nI transferred 1 crypto coin to external wallet. I left the other crypto in my Coinbase wallet.\n\nImmediately, the transaction to my external wallet was delayed for 72 hours. Coinbase stated '*this was for security*'. *I could send in my ID again and that migh would speed up the transaction'* . But I did send my ID only days earlier. This made no sense at all. So I waited for 72 hours. Finally and no earlier then after 72 hours: I received the 1 crypto coin on my external wallet. (Note: Coinbase does not delay incoming money...).\n\nI send an email to Coinbase. Advise them how to increase security without delaying transactions. They replied '*it was an interesting request and valuable to them*'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTime to bow out? **No**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Account restricted without any form of communication**\n\nSome days later I login in Coinbase. Found out that my account was restricted. Out of nowhere and without any form of communication I Could not buy Crypto. Could not send Crypto. So from this moment on I am running into financial damage.\n\nCalled Coinbase by phone. After answering several security questions and 10 minutes on the phone '*they tell me they don't help customers outside US'.* Now that's rude...\n\nSend an email. Got a (automated?) reply. '*I had to answer questions: 'Were you directed by a third party to create the account? Were you directed by a third party to transfer funds? Does anyone besides yourself have access to your account, or account credentials?'*\n\nI replied. I answered there *(customer bullying)* questions. Also filed a complaint. Repeated their own code of conduct: *'a more fair, accessible, efficient, and transparent financial system enabled by crypto and anyone, anywhere, should be able to easily and securely send and receive Bitcoin'.*\n\nI got an (automated?) reply: '*I had to send in my ID and live picture again'*. My questions stay unanswered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Resend ID**\n\nWhy I had to double send ID in less than 1 week?. But I resend my ID. In good faith. But also after I resend my ID again: Coinbase did NOT remove the restriction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Send an email to Coinbase. Again.**\n\nI send a new mail to Coinbug. I received an (automated?) reply: '*I had to resend in my ID and live picture - again - via my computer; not via my phone'.* All my questions and remarks stay unanswered.\n\nI again uploaded my ID and live picture. By phone, And by browser. And also as a PDF.\n\nThe Coinbase website then stated: '*succesfully uploaded'*. I also noticed a window in Coinbase. It stated '*congratts*' and '*that I succesfully have uploaded my ID (and picture) four (4) times'.*\n\nBut, after 4 times succesfully proofing my ID, my account still was restricted by Coinbase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Does Coinbase handle personal data like ID and live photo so carelessly?**\n\nI send a new email. I got an (automated?) reply: *'I had to send in my ID and live picture again. This time via phone. And my ID must not be expired'.*\n\nWTF. I just send in my ID and it was approved 4 times! And now Coinbase wants it for the fifth (5) time?! Does Coinbase handle personal data like ID and live photo so carelessly? Again; my questions stay unanswered...\n\nCoinbase further wrote: '*If you are still unable to verify your ID, please let us know so we can proceed with a manual review*'.\n\nSo I send Coinbase a new mail (after contacting my lawyer). Asked Coinbase to check what exactly the problem would be. And asked them for this manual review they offered. I also gave them detailed information about everything that happened so far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Despite approving my ID for 4 times: Coinbase refused manual review.**\n\nI got an (automated?) reply: *'my account was escalated for review to restore my ability to make purchases and deposits. It was determined that my account was not eligible for a review at that time.      I had to wait for one month to contact Coinbase again. Then Coinbase could submit my account for a review at that time. Coinbase was not able to elaborate on this decision-making process. Thank you for your understanding and patience'*.\n\n?!\n\nAgain; my questions stay unanswered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Very disappointed in Coinbug**\n\nThis is an rude and untrustworthy way of 'doing business'; to say the least. Coinbase suggest me to ask for a manual review. And when I do, they state that my account was not eligible for this manual review. Is this what Coinbase means with: *anyone, anywhere, should be able to easily and securely send and receive Bitcoin?!*\n\nI am very disappointed in Coinbase. Or do I have to say: Coinbug?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Coinbase AI is not so I**\n\nI went to read on Reddit. I learned that Coinbase doesn't usually answer questions. They send auto replies based on AI. And apparently this AI is not very intelligent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Several pending law suits: Customers vs Coinbase**\n\nI also read on Reddit that there are currently multiple (class action) law suits pending from customers against Coinbase. Please find the links to court cases at the end of this post. Victims claim: '*not to be able to log into their account, transfer money, buy crypto or send crypto'*. Some wrote to the Court: *'that their entire deposit would have disappeared'.* In one subpoena, I read that '*Coinbase would not even have the proper licenses to trade'*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Coinbase: what's the real problem? Liquidity? Understaffed?**\n\nCoinbase: what the f (...) are you guys doing? Do you have a liquidity problem? Are you guys understaffed? Have you guys slipped into pseudo security? Or is this a form of how to get rid of your customer(s)?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Compensation for suffered damage**\n\nCoinbase: How will you regain my trust?\n\nAnd how will you compensate me for the damage I have suffered at your actions?\n\nSigned by a a very unhappy customer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Legal information Court Cases Customers vs Coinbase**\n\n[https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/BielskivCoinbaseIncNoC2107478WHA2022BL122625NDCalApr082022CourtOp?1649770282](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/BielskivCoinbaseIncNoC2107478WHA2022BL122625NDCalApr082022CourtOp?1649770282)\n\n[https://dockets.justia.com/docket/california/candce/3:2021cv04286/379794](https://dockets.justia.com/docket/california/candce/3:2021cv04286/379794)\n\n[https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/money/coinbase-randomly-locks-users-out-of-accounts-for-months-deletes-funds-class-action-lawsuit/](https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/money/coinbase-randomly-locks-users-out-of-accounts-for-months-deletes-funds-class-action-lawsuit/)\n\n[https://www.scribd.com/document/511092244/Coinbase-class-action](https://www.scribd.com/document/511092244/Coinbase-class-action)\n\n[https://dockets.justia.com/docket/california/candce/4:2021cv08689/387670](https://dockets.justia.com/docket/california/candce/4:2021cv08689/387670)\n\n[https://www.silvermillerlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2016-12-13-DE-1-CLASS-ACTION-COMPLAINT.pdf](https://www.silvermillerlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2016-12-13-DE-1-CLASS-ACTION-COMPLAINT.pdf)",

About 6 months ago, they suspended my card for \u201csuspicious activity\u201d, but reactivated it when I contacted support. Emails to support asking what the activity was or what I might have done wrong went unanswered.\n\nEverything was good until last week. I went to the app to add funds and it said my card was temporarily suspended for suspicious activity, again. I called and got bounced through 4 different agents before someone could assist me. He looked into my account and said all looked good and reactivated the card and thanked me for being a Coinbase One subscriber. Again I asked what the \u201csuspicious activity\u201d was or what I did wrong. The agent assured me that there was nothing wrong, but that they were just being extra cautious and that I had done nothing wrong.\n\nFrustrated, but at least content that they were being extra careful, I went on. Only to open the app this morning and see my card was \u201ctemporarily suspended\u201d yet AGAIN for suspicious activity. I\u2019m blown away at this point as I literally only use this card at one merchant for the last several months. So I call. After going through a few agents, I get someone to \u201clook into my account\u201d. He returned to say that I hadn\u2019t met the criteria to have it unblocked and that it would now stay permanently blocked. When I asked why, he said that they were not allowed to share \u201cinternal decisions\u201d with cardholders. There was nothing I could do. I asked again what I had done wrong and he said the only thing he could tell me was to read the card\u2019s terms of use and see if I could figure out on my own what i might have violated. I told him the agent last week told me I had done nothing wrong and he responded by saying that that agent must have given me incorrect info.\n\nSo now, i can\u2019t use the card anymore and they won\u2019t give me any answer as to why. Even having been told I did nothing wrong. I\u2019m at a loss. I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing from a company. If I didn\u2019t live in Texas, I\u2019d switch to another platform, today.\n\nThen, I get this email saying basically what the phone agent told me:\n\n\u201cHello there,\n\nWe completed our investigation of one or more recent transactions which violated our Cardholder Agreement. We've determined that you do not meet the criteria to unblock your card.\nAs a result, your Coinbase Card will remain blocked from more spending and can no longer be used.\n\nPlease note: your Coinbase Card being blocked from spending does not impact your ability to access your funds held on Coinbase or your ability to perform other activities with us.\n\nHowever, depending on your specific situation, there may be other restrictions that would restrict your ability to complete specific activities with us.\n\nWe appreciate your patience and understanding.\n\nRegards,\nCoinbase Support\u201d\n\nEveryone should beware this company and their shady tactics.",

We discovered that pending / lifetime rewards were displayed incorrectly on Earn Interest and Asset pages. These amounts should not have been displayed at all for ADA staking.\n\nWe recently rolled out a change that removes the incorrect pending amount field. Yield is being generated and will be added to your account once available, but you will not see a pending amount.\n\nIf you are still seeing a pending amount field, try logging out of your mobile app and logging back in.

It's not any 6 digits I can think I might have set as a  passcode.\n\nHowever, Coinbase  support has been useless - when I open the app, the only option I have  is to enter a 6 digit passcode. (Case #06273473 )\n\nI don't have access to any settings, or any other option to reset my account with my 12 word seed phrase.\n\nI cannot access the app past the passcode to take any suggested recovery steps.\n\nThese instructions from support don't work:\n\nIf you no longer have access to your Coinbase Wallet PIN:  \n\\-  First, sign out of your Coinbase Wallet account and reimport your  wallet using your 12 word recovery phrase or Google Drive/iCloud backup.  \n\\- You can do this by opening the app and selecting \u201cI already have a wallet\u201d  \n\\- If you\u2019re unable to sign out of the account we recommend uninstalling and reinstalling the Coinbase Wallet app\n\nBecause  I cannot sign out of the wallet. I have uninstalled the app and  re-installed. I cannot select \"I already have a wallet\" because it only  demands a passcode(!)\n\nI would post a screen grab, but apparently images are not allowed in this forum. It simply says:\n\nUnlock with your passcode.\n\nAnd gives the number keypad. No settings option, nothing. No other path to follow.\n\nThis process does not work, as it relies on seeing a \"settings\" option that's not presented.

I was able to make trades after I rectified it luckily but it forced me to transfer money from my account. I wanted to transfer money from my Coinbase Pro account to Coinbase but the system disallowed this transfer. I would have preferred to do that but now I am stuck in some sort of loop. I have since funded my account but remain locked and was wondering how long I am going to be locked and unable to move money because I use the Coinbase Card to pay my bills. This makes me want to go back to using centralized banks, seems like Coinbase freaks out over a small payment failing.",

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nAs the post title suggests, I received an e-mail out of nowhere asking me to verify a Coinbase account that I didn't create, followed by another e-mail minutes later telling me the account had been verified. Changed my password as a precaution/checked all my 2fa settings in case my e-mail had been compromised (I didn't click any links due to potential phishing concerns), but I looked it up and it seems like a lot of users on here have had similar issues\u2014these e-mails came from legitimate Coinbase domains.\n\nTried calling support as I was instructed to on the website but couldn't get through as they needed me to input the phone number connected to the newly created account (which obviously I don't have). Tried opening a ticket through Coinbase support only to receive an auto reply telling me support was limited where I am and to use self-support instead. Again, bafflingly, this is an issue many other people seem to have had.\n\nI don't know what's going on here but I have no interest in a Coinbase account and would like to lock this account that I didn't create. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Support ticket #11188293",

            "selftext": " So Im still not sure exactly how I got hacked, I feel like it was a keylogger on my laptop or a screen grabber on my phone. Its a bit frustrating really because this is the first time this happens to me and I consider myself taking precautions measurements to ensure my crypto is safe, and one of those measurements is not having all the eggs in the same basket. SO thankfully they did not take A LOT of money but, still....\n\nSo this was the initial transaction that I did not approve or or know of on etherscan :  \n[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8ee8a7361f96beca69ef2bbd205a60a3e2f97f2bc8368e0eed44cfaf1dd69a0c](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8ee8a7361f96beca69ef2bbd205a60a3e2f97f2bc8368e0eed44cfaf1dd69a0c)  \nIt goes from my wallet to their wallet.\n\nI started following that wallet address : [https://etherscan.io/address/0x1326b00056a38aa402f522f67cd78f7b42042c17](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1326b00056a38aa402f522f67cd78f7b42042c17)  \n0x1326b00056A38aa402F522F67cd78F7b42042c17\n\nAnd it seems like they do bulk transactions at specific timings in the day. Both in and out.... the money keeps moving. Until I saw that most of the moving goes to that address :[https://etherscan.io/address/0x39f6a6c85d39d5abad8a398310c52e7c374f2ba3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x39f6a6c85d39d5abad8a398310c52e7c374f2ba3)\n\nwhich is a 2million+$ account. Of course no one could tell if all the money on that wallet is stolen money or not, but that wallet is quite active and that wallet address that hacked me tends to send most of the money it gets to that 3 million dollar wallet.\n\nI know there are some black hat hackers out there. But I feel like there should be something done to track or check and see if that account starts taking out money or transferring to banks or cash-out somewhere then they could be identified ! It just seems like a wild west currently with hackers or scammers in the crypto world , and millions are stolen from people that worked hard to save money. Has any one had any experience with tracking or identifying addresses in the crypto world ?",

Started using it for small retail transactions and online purchases and was pleasantly surprised to find that I could pay my rent through the property management web portal by splitting my payment to stay within the $2500 per day transaction limit.\n\nMy card was suspended due to suspicious activity in January and a quick look at my transactions revealed that there was an illegitimate transaction. I was glad to see that their security was up to scratch as debit transactions typically have less protection against loss than credit cards. A week later, a new card arrived and I was back to using it regularly. All in all a positive experience with the occasional irritation of running into the spending limit.  \n\nUntil this week.\n\nI tried to pay my second rent installment and the transaction was declined. I thought I entered the details wrong, tried again and was declined again. Checked the app and saw that the card was suspended again due to \u201csuspicious\u201d activity. But this time, there were no transactions other than ones that I had made.\n\nAgain, back to customer support and figured it would be resolved. Yes, customer support is terribly unprofessional and marginal but I was able to make headway. On Thursday of this week I received an email that said my card was permanently suspended due to use that violated terms of service.  know that Coinbase won\u2019t tell me how I ran afoul of their rules but I paid for rent, groceries, gas, tuition, restaurants. I suppose somewhere I\u2019ve done something that they don\u2019t like but that will remain a mystery.\n\nHerein lies my frustration and concern.  I\u2019ve had a visa debit card from my bank for more than 25 years and it has never once been \u201csuspended\u201d.  Similar for two other visa debit cards tied to checking accounts that are more than 10 years old. \n\nIts just worth remembering that Coinbase is a financial services company not a bank. Like PayPal, Venmo and a whole range of \u201cpseudo banks\u201d, they can take action against you that is very hard to fight against as they don\u2019t follow the same regulatory framework as traditional banks and credit card companies. There is a litany of complaints in this sub reddit about capricious account closures, loss of funds, accounting errors. Its all here to read and there will be many many more sad stories.  I\u2019ve got two young sons and this experience reminded me to emphasize to them to establish a financial life with a traditional bank and use \u201cpseudo bank services\u201d very carefully.\n\nSo enjoy that Coinbase card - just don\u2019t let yourself start depending on it for your day-to-day financial life. You could be cut off in a moment with absolutely no recourse.  Keep as little fiat and crypto as possible in the hands of Coinbase as possible (no more than you can afford to lose). \n\nI\u2019m disappointed to miss out on the rewards but realize that this whole situation could have turned out much much worse.",

In that scenario, the exchange where the crypto is sold does not know the cost basis. Also, Coinbase doesn't \u201cexpect\u201d you to do anything. The IRS, on the other hand, expects you to track and report your crypto gains and losses. They have *no idea* what those are unless you tell them (they don't get a 1099 from Coinbase, either). If you check \"Yes\" to the question on the 1040 that asks if you sold or exchanged crypto, they will expect to see your gains and losses reported and possibly audit you if they aren't. If you check \"No,\" you will have technically committed perjury. So my advice would be to do whatever you have to do to determine your gains and losses, and report them.",

I\u2019d rather piss everyone off until further notice by \u201cbreaking\u201d my app if I believed my system was compromised. \n\nBut I\u2019m not Coinbase. So they could be acting assholes, but I hope not for your sake <3 \n\nAlso, I would highly recommend everyone move everything but the crypto they can live with losing into a wallet because I don\u2019t think exchanges are going to be MORE secure. That\u2019s like walking into the NYSE with 400,000 dollars worth of stock certificates in your back pocket and just hoping no one nicks it when you\u2019re not looking.

I had to ask them to let me call them back and they weren't pushy and also gave me their employee ID. I just need some guidance on whether or not this call from Chula Vista is legit. :(",

I'm not sure how this is legal but holy shit is this a terrible business practice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Finally got through to an \"escalated supervisor.\" None of the three reps would give me a straight answer, but this rep was very friendly and assured me it was a bug, it was not because the merchant was prohibited, and that I was told that incorrectly. I also know Coinbase is reading this.\n\nWill you please give a statement regarding this? Because one of your reps stated you were seizing my money, locked my account and stated it was Coinbase's policy about \"prohibited merchants\" that allowed this. I can provide the information for you to review the calls, but I'd like a public statement. You took a significant amount of money for a stated reason, and now it's allegedly a \"bug.\" I'm suspicious.\n\nETA2: they are sticking with the glitch story and completely ignoring the prohibited merchant issue.

Email headers look like it was sent from Coinbase as well . I did find several results here on reddit too and there are mixed comments some saying they're not real while others saying that coinbase does use sendsafely for their files. Any thoughts on this as they ask for documents verification to be uploaded though the link provided.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: As another reddit user u/OursIsTheFury stated in a comment, the second email was too mentioning that they believe I'm part of the Russian sanctions, which obviously it is not the case.

I ran over to T-mobile for a new sim after about 24 mins since the attack begin.. at 12:16 coinbase email said here is your verification. At 12:17 it said here is your new password and at 12:18 it said your account is locked due to suspicious activity.. \n\nI'm still waiting to login after the recovery as I am writing this so I don't know if they had enough time to steal my crypto.. do you think it being locked was coinbase security or them trying to lock me out ?",

While I was able to find information about where you cannot use the Coinbase Card, such as gambling and crypto exchanges, I was not able to find any information on whether or not certain purchases were ineligible for crypto rewards. I was recently a Crypto.com Visa Card user, and they had certain restrictions with regards to what purchases would qualify for CRO rewards. Things like paying for auto insurance or buying items from a gift shop or memorabilia would not be rewarded. The purchase would be completed, you just wouldn't receive a reward for the purchase. Are there any such restrictions for rewards from the Coinbase Card? Specifically, I'm interested in:\n\n* Purchasing a computer either from a box store, like Best Buy or Walmart, or directly from a manufacturer, like Dell or HP. Believe it or not, this was a question mark for the CDC Visa card. It all depends upon how the merchant is coded with Visa.\n* Purchasing items from a gift shop when on vacation, such as at Universal or Disney. These kind of purchases are definitely not rewarded with CDC Visa card.\n* Paying for a semester of college, whether at community college or a university. I believe this would have received rewards with CDC Visa card, but I never got to test it out.\n\nThanks for any insight!\n\nEdit: I don't respond to random DMs; too many scammers!",

CB sucks for doing that & it shows a total lack of transparency on their part.\n\nI went on the CB app a few days ago and saw the rewards ticker there. However, the rewards were substantially less than what I should have & the rewards were a different amount than what CB desktop reflected. So I'm being shown 2 different amounts of rewards for the same staked ETH depending on what platform I use.\n\nWhen I contacted CB about the staking rewards discrepancy, removal of the rewards ticker and lack of transparency they responded with a cut and paste reply. They never addressed my concerns & just reminded me that my ETH was locked and I couldn't move it.\n\nI'd love to see a class action if this isn't resolved for everyone. This is a major screw up for them & to remove the ticker is so shady.",

This basically means that even if the price were to shoot up, you probably wouldn't even be able to sell them as there is not a strong market for this token.  \n\nProjects like these are why I always tell newbies to study Bitcoin and Ethereum prior to jumping into these moonshot investments.  Trying to pick the next best crypto without a comprehensive understanding of what make BTC and ETH the best in the game is like trying to pick the next star basketball player without ever watching Jordan, Lebron or Kobe play the game.",

Yes CDC has been better then Coinbase for the last 12 months and coinbase has been in its shadows, you must of seen all the advertisement and thought \u201cdamn, i\u2019ve backed the wrong horse\u201d at which point you could of changed but you let your emotions get the better of you and you wanted to stay loyal to a company that doesn\u2019t care about it\u2019s customers. Always do what\u2019s right for you and if that is going to a competitor then you should go for it! drop the hate dude it will take years of you life else",
