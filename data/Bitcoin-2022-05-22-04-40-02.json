My take away was that Elon seemed very concise and knowledgeable regarding financial systems and the benefits and limitations of Bitcoin.  I was a bit surprised that Jack basically just said, \"I like the community\".  I'm sure there wasn't enough time for Jack to dive into how Bitcoin helps mitigate the predatory nature of our current financial models. This is just my personal takeaway from this video.  I'm not hating on Bitcoin whatsoever.  Also, not sure how old this vid is.",
