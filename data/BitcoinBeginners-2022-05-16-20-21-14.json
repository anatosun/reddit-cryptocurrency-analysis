In exchange for getting something off the ground he settled for pseudonymity, as anonymity with the UTXO model is a hard problem. \n\nLuckily people are still working on this. The recent Taproot upgrade introduced Schnorr signatures, which have the potential to effectively mask owners. I expect in a few years this will be fleshed out and integrated into wallets for a seamless experience.\n\nI\u2019m the meantime there are several available, if not inconvenient, ways to ensure anonymity.\n\nAll modern wallets use extended private keys which generate a new address for every transaction. Sure the feds can track the coins you send from a KYC exchange to your first address, but as you spend them they all leave that address for new ones. It\u2019s hard but maybe not impossible for them to follow the trail.\n\nYou can transfer your coins to Lightning and back again, effectively washed. \n\nYou can use a coinjoin service. \n\nYou can find non-KYC ways to get coins.",
