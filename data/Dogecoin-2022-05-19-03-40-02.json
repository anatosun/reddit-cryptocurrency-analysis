Pro-tip: get a BACKUP or even 2.\n\nThese are veeeery not realiable quality-wise and will bug out on you in the least expected moment.\n\nThe most frustrating bug is when it goes into BOOT mode which takes around 14 hrs lol and you cant use the wallet meanwhile.\n\nI went through 3 already that essentially stopped working or died with time, stoppeturning on etc.\n\nI have 2 backups ready to go initialized with the same seed as the original cause having to wait 14hrs in crypto world is death",
