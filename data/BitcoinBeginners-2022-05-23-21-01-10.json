My friend runs a smaller exchange in Vietnam and they've been planning an update from legacy addresses for years, hopefully to implement in Q4 this year. It's definitely an arduous process, rewriting the backend and updating thousands of accounts while keeping opsec. He'll also be integrating lightning, which I'm excited for.\n\nIt is necessary however and legacy addresses are an increasing red flag as time goes on.",
