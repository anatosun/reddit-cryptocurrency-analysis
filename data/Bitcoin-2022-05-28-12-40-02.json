BTC is tied to fit because, well, I guess we kinda screwed that one up already by linking it to the FIAT value...

Now I'll be honest, i have no idea in what the value of FIAT resides, I'm pretty sure there is a something... Maybe metals, I don't know... But anyway, anything needs a something else to have its value defined.  \n\n\nYou can buy a car with 60k USD, you can also buy a car with roughly 2BTC (as of now; and you'd still need to find somewhere that accepts bitcoin) -- But if you don't know the comparative value, how do you say how much BTC is a car worth? If we assume that 1BTC = 1BTC ; how many BTCs is a car worth? We need some other value... Might not be FIAT, but needs to be something.",

Most Americans will instinctually know that $5 will get you about a gallon of gas, and that it *used* to get you closer to 2 gallons a decade ago. And they know that about thousands of other products. \n\nWith BTC, without that common usage, the easiest thing to do is convert BTC to a USD/fiat value and go from there. \n\nMass adoption and the use of BTC as currency, rather than an investment option, will help make it easier to instinctually value BTC. \n\nAnd to wrap it all back to the original post, by that time it will measured in Satoshis, mainly because people tend to prefer doing math with larger whole numbers than in small fractions. \n\nEasier to see the difference between 20,000 and 2,000,000 than 0.0002 and 0.0000002",

You just increase your chance to get wrecked, but if you've evaluated the risks and reward correctly and are still comfortable with it, then maybe do it. It's what Michael Saylor is doing on a larger scale. Like him, just make sure you can afford it if things go south.\n\nWhat you're describing is simply shorting the US dollar (or whatever currency you would borrow). It's a common idea. A lot of people did it in the United States in 2008. They thought real estate would keep going up, so they essentially shorted the dollar and bought real estate. Lots of people got rich. Until it didn't work anymore. Then many people lost everything. You can do it with Bitcoin. I'm not even trying to discourage you from doing it. You could make some good money.\n\nFor what it's worth, I don't. It seems too risky to me. I have a low-rate mortgage that I'm paying off as slowly as I can, so I'm shorting the dollar in that way, but I don't borrow fiat to buy Bitcoin. I believe in Bitcoin completely, but I know that today BTC acts like a very speculative asset. So even though I think Bitcoin is better to hold than the dollar, I think its short term price fluctuations make it dangerous to do this with. But I'm pretty risk-adverse (although I acknowledge that _not_ shorting the dollar to the maximum extent that I'm able has its own set of risks). In the end, you have to do what will allow you good, restful sleep at night.",
