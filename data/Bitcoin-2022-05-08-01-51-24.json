Things so simple that most people laughed, were too smart for, seeing right through their artless folly. How can for example, simply heating something save millions of lives and give onto the study of microbe science as Luis Pasteur discovered with pasteurization? Why is that a world altering discovery? Humans have a tendency to go out looking for complexity, and this I believe is called *complexity bias*, which sounds unique, in that the majority of cognitive biases exist to save mental energy, but really it is, in fact, another mental shortcut, one that makes me quite confident that bitcoin the network has exploited unrecognized simplicities, the telltale sign of technological treasure.\n\n**Harvard CS**: Ok, I'm listening.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis orange \ud83d\udc8a will be one of my finest moments (still work to do), because the highest rung I've gotten so far is a Director of Philanthropy at a mid-size charity some of you might know. This CS is a rung above that because of what she represents. There's not much higher to climb though, because beyond this would be fortune 1000 territory and Peter Schiff. Finna leave those balls for the designated hitters.\n\n*P.S.*\n\n*I also believe self-custody has turned into a complexity bias. It's gotten ridiculous. Dabbling in Shamir Secrets, SeedXor, multisig schemes, substitution cyphers, FediMint, STOP! So ridiculous we now have this full-blown L1 fork called BIP119 that promises to fix it once and for all.

You do not sound like someone who has thought a lot about passing on your wealth in a will, after you die.\n\nBIP119 makes bitcoins more secure for people and institutions that  need security.  It helps them self-custody their own coins rather than giving them to a trusted custodian.  It helps them set up a scheme with a lawyer that can give control to their heirs after they die, without risking the lawyer taking it all in the meantime.  Money is only valuable to you when it is valuable to other people, so you should appreciate some of their concerns.  \n\nOf course people can memorize seeds.  If you don't need better security than that, then congratulations your privacy plan is working.  But if someone doxxes you as a bitcoiner, and the $5-wrench-wielding thugs know where you live, then you will want better security.  Even if no one will ever dox you, think of all the millions who had to go through amlkyc to get coins, because mining economics were not in their favor.  They are mostly doxxed already, and are more likely to need better self-custody options.\n\nWhen other people decide they need bitcoins, you don't fault them for the reason why, right?  So, why be so against some bitcoiners who want better custody options?",

Nobody claims that BIP119 makes external custodians completely go away.  \n\nIt makes bitcoins more useful to people:\n\n* that have self-custody needs different from yours, since as a result some of them will not give up on security and use a custodian; and  \n\n* who need to use [scaling and privacy pools](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/building-on-taproot-payment-pools-could-be-bitcoins-next-layer-two-protocol), because the pools can be bigger with BIP119 than with other techniques, due to interactivity requirements.\n\n> I'm currently investing an exploit with BIP119 and it relates to MIT's [supposedly abandoned] ChainAnchor.\n\nThat's awesome and I hope you can tell us what is going on.  You know you can win a 5.5 bitcoin bounty if it's a showstopper!  \n\nIt also has nothing to do with your original complaints.  I'm judging it as total and complete [red herring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring)...\n\n...But I wouldn't if you told me some specifics.  Then I could judge it as right or wrong.  I would like to hear anything that you know, besides \"ChainAnchor\", because I don't see how BIP119 enables the the attack.  (Should the attack be possible without BIP119, then that would also be a red herring.)  If you can change my mind I would be very grateful.\n\n> You said \"better security\", and I'm unaware of 24-word seeds/passphrases being broken.\n\nOf course the simple cryptography is as advertised. You say you have your seed backed up and you're not splitting it with Shamir, so then if you are ever going to give these bitcoins to people you love, after you exit this plane of existence, you will have a physical object that other people can find and exploit.\n\nThe whole point of self-custody features is to improve your defense by removing that attack point.  Like I said earlier, if you don't want it, then cool.  But if I do want it, and I have clear reasons that it can help millions of people making slightly different choices than you, then you gotta show me how it increases some risk for you and your setup.\n\n> BIP119 introduces security exploits off-chain.\n\nFUD, my friend.   You are giving no clue whatsoever to your claim.\n\n> A $5 wrench? What exactly does BIP119 solve that a hard wallet duress PIN doesn't in that case?\n\nSomeone [asked a similar question](/r/Bitcoin/comments/ti2x6a/how_does_multisig_protect_you_against_the_5/i1bose0/) a month ago.  BIP119 allows similar options, but **even more advanced**, so I will quote myself:\n\n>>You have to apply iterated rounds to the game theory.\n>>\n>> Multisig protects you in the following ways:\n>>\n>>* criminals learn (before they attack you) that people with multisig are expensive to attack, because they have to not only multiply their risk of getting caught times the number of signers, but also kidnap and coerce multiple signers at once, so that you do not warn the next signer;\n>>\n>>* you can prove your use of multisig by revealing the script, so that you can encourage de-escalation;\n>>\n>>* wallets that always use multisig advertise their difficulty to all attackers at once.\n\nOkay back to discussion.\n\n> I think you've been enticed by talk of smart contracts and other bullshit that DLC's, Taproot scripting, and HTLC's will easily achieve.\n\nHave you looked at some of the code proving what can be done with BIP119?  [This vault feature](https://github.com/jamesob/simple-ctv-vault#why-ctv) definitely cannot be done without a consensus change to Bitcoin.  Obviously regular users wouldn't engage with it like this.  In our shared future, vaults will be a wallet feature that is mostly hidden.\n\nBIP119 is the simplest change possible to do this, and the other possible consensus changes do not even have their BIPs finished, so they are years away.  People do make decisions about whether to hand their bitcoins to custodians, and without wallet developers building better options, we'll lose years of people to custodians.  Their loss of privacy will then make your transactions easier to extract using the blockchain analysis.  You should care about this.\n\n> You're not talking by the way to some ersatz newb without an excellent command of this stuff.\n\nI appreciate a real conversation.  So many people have picked sides based on what their favorite luminaries said on Youtube or Twitter.\n\n**tldr**:\n\n  * you haven't shown how BIP119 harms anyone\n\n  * you haven't acknowledged that many people want self-custody options different from your choices\n\n  * you might be confused about recusive covenants versus non-recursive covenants\n\n  * you have shifted the goalposts to FUD\n\n  * i have shown in specific ways how self-custody can be improved, and why you want that for others\n\n  * BIP119 offers the best scaling and privacy pools, allowing more people to make transactions in a future where even settling a LN channel is too expensive for most people.",

Nobody wanted to get dragged into court for spinning up yet another altcoin and rug-pulling all the 'investors'.",

The fact that they call it a cryptocurrency instead of shares and that there is a disclaimer that the investor has no rights, does not mean that it is not a security.  It has all the properties of security with the additional loophole that investors get scammed because they have no rights, projects operate opaquely, the project's team is not answerable to investors and can abandon the project when they've collected enough money or lose interest.  The last 5 years has confirmed that almost every one of these projects are either scams or at best hyped money grabs.  It's mind boggling that the SEC did nothing to prevent the bamboozling of investors to hundreds of these crypto projects on U.S. exchanges while at the same time rejecting multiple Bitcoin ETF submissions, which addressed prior SEC concerns, under the guise of protecting retail investors.",

Is it possible to create a multisig address with the following payout structure: A and B have to sign plus one of the others (C, D, E). So something like a 3 of 5 but with the limitation that A and B must be part of the singning process? If this is possible, is there a name for this kind of multisig? Does anybody know where to find more information about this?\n2. I heard that it is possible to create a multisig address where the numer of needed keys decays over time. Eg a 5 of 5 where every year one key less is needed. Does anybody know where to find more information about this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

I don't think any wallet really supports this functionality at the moment, so you'd have to build the addresses and sign transactions manually or code the software yourself.\n\nIn the first example, you'd want the redeemscript to have a 2 of 2 multisigverify script as well as a 1 of 3 multisig script. It would look something like this:\n\n    OP_2\n    <pubkey1><pubkey2>\n    OP_2\n    OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY\n    OP_1\n    <pubkey3><pubkey4><pubkey5>\n    OP_3\n    OP_CHECKMULTISIG\n\nThe second example would be even more complex, but possible with nested IF/THEN timelock multisigs. It might look like this:\n\n    OP_IF\n    OP_IF\n    OP_IF\n    OP_IF\n    \n    OP_1\n    <5 years> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP\n    <pubkey1><pubkey2><pubkey3><pubkey4><pubkey5> OP_5 OP_CHECKMULTISIG\n    \n    OP_ELSE\n    OP_2\n    <4 years> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP\n    <pubkey1><pubkey2><pubkey3><pubkey4><pubkey5> OP_5 OP_CHECKMULTISIG\n    OP_ENDIF\n    \n    OP_ELSE\n    OP_3\n    <3 years> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP\n    <pubkey1><pubkey2><pubkey3><pubkey4><pubkey5> OP_5 OP_CHECKMULTISIG OP_ENDIF\n    \n    OP_ELSE\n    OP_4\n    <2 years> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP\n    <pubkey1><pubkey2><pubkey3><pubkey4><pubkey5> OP_5 OP_CHECKMULTISIG OP_ENDIF\n    \n    OP_ELSE\n    OP_5\n    <1 years> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP\n    <pubkey1><pubkey2><pubkey3><pubkey4><pubkey5> OP_5 OP_CHECKMULTISIG\n    OP_ENDIF\n\n\\*Note this script probably needs to be debugged, I'm sure it might need correction. But it's the general idea, where increasing timepoints will use a fewer number of signatures.\n\nTo get started, I would read up on advanced bitcoin scripts: [https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch07.asciidoc](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch07.asciidoc)",

Mutlisig is a very specific script, and there are a few variants of multisig, but they all assume N-of-M or M-of-M, and don't discriminate by the keys themselves.\n\n2. Yes, but I don't know of any wallets today that help you do it. This would also be a script address where the script has the decay described within it.\n\nAll of this is possible, but requires a deep understanding of Bitcoin, and/or a willingness to develop, and test the idea. Often, once created, a script like this would end up on one or two wallets until it is considered tested long enough to be safe and suddenly it will be available on many wallets.",
