However, they also mention that they're using Ethereum smart contracts and as far as I know, Ethereum is a proof-of-work public blockchain.\n\nMy questions are:\n1) How is this possible? Did they fork Ethereum and modified the source?\n2) If Ethereum somehow supports this, is this possible with all blockchains that support Smart contracts, say Cardano?\n\nPapers I've read:\nG\u00fcrsoy, G., Brannon, C.M. & Gerstein, M.

So it's the software built to run Ethereum, and it runs the Ethereum Virtual Machine and contracts written for Ethereum, but it's not the Ethereum network.\n\nGenerally you shouldn't need to modify the source code to do this since several consensus mechanisms are supported by default, but they might have done that if they wanted a feature that it didn't have.\n\nCardano doesn't support the Ethereum Virtual Machine, so Cardano software wouldn't help you with this specific case. You could do something similar where you took the Cardano software and used it to make a different network (I'm not sure how much you could do by configuring it and how much you'd need to change the source code) but if the goal is to run smart contracts then I can't think why you'd use that platform, there are lots of better smart contract platforms aside from the EVM.",

That's the blockspace, a pretty scarce resource. \n\nReading is just you reading the chain. You're already paying for your electricity and computer to read the chain. You can do that as much as you want without impacting anyone else. \n\nBut when you write, you need to ask for the consensus to add your content onto the chain and to be stored by everyone having a node. It means someone else may not be able to store their own content because you've out priced them. As I've already said, it's scarce space, so you need to prove to the network your content is worth being stored, by paying for it. \n\nOtherwise, that scarce resource that blockspace is could be spammed by malevolent actors for free. Gas costing something is a security measure, even though being cheap is a possibility brought by L2s.",
