So my 12,000 LUNA was forcfully converted i to 12,000 LUNC 2 days ago without any mention to myself. I had no idea.\n\nSo now 2 days later LUNA is $16 each token... And LUNC.. $ the 12000 still worth $2 ....\n\nI would have $195,000 Canadian dollar if crypto com did not convert my luna into LUNC.\n\nNow they claim LUNA is LUNA2 but its actually NOT.\n\nLUNA is still the old luna and showing the old charts. As where lunc just shows it near negative. Never was luna c over 50cents.\n\nNever.\n\nSo im on phone with lawyer what u guys think",
