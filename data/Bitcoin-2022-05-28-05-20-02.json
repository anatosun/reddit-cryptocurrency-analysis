The permissionless nature might have something to do with it to, telling us what can and cannot be done with fiat is ingrained in most people. \n\nAnyone who can prevent you from ever having sats in the future will have even more power over you down the road. \n \nStack and get your coins off the exchanges.",

By 1999 it was where the smart people were searching (kind of like BTC in 2013) and by 2002 it was de facto, but early. 2005 it was mainstream and huge.\n\nToday it probably can't be beat from a pure search position. If you're searching via text for web sites, it's pointless to try to beat Google.\n\nThat being said, there's plenty of room in photo & video to disrupt.\n\nSo, coming full-circle back to BTC, I'd say we're in the 2002 stage. De facto, but only for those with the skill (and risk appetite) to invest online and use wallets, or understand Centralized Exchanges.\n\nIt's still possible to disrupt this and grab mindshare/marketshare, but it won't be easy. First mover (it technically wasn't), largest marketcap, best known...it has all of that, but so did Yahoo.\n\nYou don't want BTC to be the Yahoo of cryptocurrency. You want it to be the Google, and to be that it needs to be used by 100's of millions and continually evolving into a powerhouse with a moat that can't be breached.\n\nUntil everyone that banks has the ability to EASILY invest or transact in BTC, the entire crypto market is ripe for disruption, and CBDC's + legislation will do their best to accomplish that.",

Steam power was then forgotten about until 1698. \n\nRome has a lot of good examples actually, once a glass blower discovered how to make basically  unbreakable glass. When he brought his invention to the Roman emperor he was murdered and the knowledge of how to make it was either lost or destroyed.historian Speculation is the reason was either to protect glass making industries ( they would fail if everyone only needed one glass item like a cup or bowl, the price would plummet for such items and any common beggar could afford what was once probably fine and expensive just my theory)or the weapons industry as forging light glass unbreakable swords would of wiped it out over night.\n\nEdit: sorry I misremembered the story it\u2019s not unbreakable glass it was flexible glass. While flexible glass is considered nearly  unbreakable it\u2019s kinda a different idea too. Where the focus was on the fact that it was malleable and apparently the emperors motivation was still to protect glass makers loo\n\nAnd there is a modern equivalent and it\u2019s used in modern fibre optic cable. \n\nSo I guess only the Roman steam technology applies, but still cool.",
