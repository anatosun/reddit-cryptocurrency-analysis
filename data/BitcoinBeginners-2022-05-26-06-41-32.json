You'd need to use a service or an exchange to exchange your LN bitcoin for regular bitcoin.\n\nIf you mean to hold this bitcoin a long time, you should not use lightning. Consider a lightning wallet as a spending wallet. That's what it's meant for. If the plan is to hodl, buy and withdraw regular layer 1 bitcoin.",

Once the bitcoin are in your lightning wallet you have control of them and you can either spend them , send them back to the exchange , or close the channel and the bitcoin can than be sent onchain . \n\n>Like ledger?\n\nHardware wallets work with many software wallets , some of these software wallets like electrum have ability to send and receive lightning txs",
