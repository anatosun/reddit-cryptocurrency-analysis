Inevitably his politics and ideology becomes intertwined with Dogecoin. He has too much influence and is far too invested for it not to.\n\nIMO the well has long been poisoned and I don't want to be tarred with he same brush or be guilty by association with this tool. \n\nI wish you all the very best of luck, but this is where I get off.",

You trying to make it political won't change anything about that.\n\nBut if you think censorship and gatekeeping is the way to go, the concept of \"do only good everyday\" is lost on you anyways.",
