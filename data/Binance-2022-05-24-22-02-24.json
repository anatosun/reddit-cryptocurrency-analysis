That would be stupid!\nSimilarly each coin has its own blockchain but what if we want to use the coin on another blockchain for a yield opportunity or staking or lending or anything better provided by blockchain?\nIn that case what we do is we lock the coins on its own blockchain through a smart contract and mint the same amount of \"tokens\" on the other chain that represents the other coins. \nNow obviously to do this you should have proof that the coins are yours and they exist on the other chain which these 40 assets have not been able to give. According to this post, they are just minting tokens that represent other coins from thin air.",
