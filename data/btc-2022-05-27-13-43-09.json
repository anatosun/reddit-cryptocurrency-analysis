A 1mg (milligram = 6 cents) [Cash-Gold](https://www.ebay.com/itm/164961330561) note should be practical to issue and smaller than the smallest Bitcoin (546 sats = 16c). BCH is not necessarily an upgrade in this respect, due to the dust limit. 1mg notes, though, can't be printed the same way as heavier notes because they're worth less than the printing costs (anti-counterfeiting, etc), unless it's a very simple polymer note in Black&White. 1mg notes probably wouldn't make sense in first-world countries.\n\nGold wins on layer 1 **throughput**, but not against BCH.\n\nGold wins on value stability, and is therefore **backing** for Bitcoin.\n\nGold is **10x** silver, but BTC is only **2.5x** ETH. Gold is a clear alpha-male, but not BTC (unless ETH is more of a joke).\n\nGold wins as a non-electronic backup, in case something goes wrong with the **internet**, or smartphones stop working for some reason.\n\nBitcoin wins on **decentralization**, due to the expense of XRF [X-Ray machine](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Gold-Tester-Machine-Precious-Metal-Analyzer_1600189813819.html)s (**$7k** after tax & shipping). If anyone can print & issue cash-gold, then in that case every merchant would need an x-ray machine (a little PoS unit for testing weight & purity of cash-gold). A smartphone with SPV wallet is sufficient to verify Bitcoin payments.\n\nBitcoin wins on **merchant acceptance**. (e.g. DNMs.)\n\nBitcoin has better payment **accuracy**. Cash-gold users always have to round up a few extra cents (nearest mg, or possibly even 10mg). \n\nTo oppose the gold standard I'd have to **support fiat**. I'd have to. Supporters of fiat may prefer we push for Bitcoin, therefore, because the gold standard is what they're really afraid of. Bitcoin isn't really a threat, especially when tether does almost everything Bitcoin does.",

The way I phrased my question in the title is carefully phrased because it addresses a central (possibly unsustainable) crucial assumption, possibly?\n\nThink about it like this. If the hopeful statement in the title is true, then future investors will also believe the same thing. Bitcoin will not likely be substantially different today than a decade from now, with the exception of some BIP changes that probably take care of minor technical issues. How can bitcoin legitimately \"gain value\" if the main codebase and underlying technology is still 99.9% the same? How can a doubling or tripling of price be justified (assuming the price represents the market value of 1 bitcoin) wherein there is no doubling or tripling of the \"intrinsic value\"? Basically, it seems to me like the price has \"de-pegged\" from any coherent valuation model and that the price is just increasing over time arbitrarily due to market forces, rather than on it becoming more useful, more purposeful, or more ubiquitous. \n\nIf bitcoin became the \"world reserve currency\" then maybe it has justification to increase in value every decade forever and approach \"infinite price\" which happens pretty quickly on a logarithmic graph/chart for an asset which has compounding growth. \n\nBasically, 99% of my focus today is on hearing 1 or 2 really solid answers to the title question please. \n\n___\n\n**TL;DR:** Does modern bitcoin (BTC) investment rely on hope that the following statement is always true? \"Bitcoin will be worth more in 10 years than it's value today\"? \ud83e\udd14",
