In this case, I would advise watching out for the sunk cost fallacy.  The sunk cost fallacy is saying \"I have already invested so much money in this that I can't back out now.\"  The best way to look at these decisions is to say, \"I thought it was a good investment, but had I known then what I know now, I would not make the same decision.\"  Then it is easy to see the correct action - accept the loss and move on to more profitable endeavors.\n\nThe best time to buy Bitcoin was 10 years ago.
