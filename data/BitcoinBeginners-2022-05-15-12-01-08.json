And I came across this section where they said they can \n\n\u201cblock, cancel, or reverse a Transaction you have authorized (even after Digital Assets and/or fiat currency have been debited from or credited to your Account)\u201d if the government demands. \n\nI know BTC transactions are irreversible. So I am surprised why they have this statement\ud83e\udd72\n\nSo I am curious if somehow exchanges have some sort of way to reverse my transactions?\n\nI have withdrawn all my bitcoin from this exchange to my hardware wallet but I am worried they may \u201cconfiscate\u201d it in the future.\n\nI am asking because the political climate in my country is about to get really bad and I criticize my government openly so Im worried they might \u201cconfiscate\u201d of freeze my bitcoin.\n\nThank you in advance.
