A new project gets launched and pumped up by a couple whales, speculation gets amplified, personalities are hyped along with their projects, and a few months down the line it usually all ends up in tears ($TIME, et al.)\n\nBeyond all the mess and fake hype, I believe there are innovative projects with ironclad fundamentals that tend to fly under most people's radars.\n\nAmong my new favorites, I'm bullish on [Zebec.io](https://Zebec.io) , a continuous settlement protocol that allows for real-time continuous streams of payments. Also very bullish on [liquality.io](https://liquality.io), a multi-chain \"superwallet\" with one-lick atomic swaps that makes Metamask (and their support team) look like hot gabage.\n\nCurious to find out what under-the-radar projects everyone is currently bullish on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease, no nft's or \"node\" projects\n\nEdit: Ty so much for all the suggestions. Lots of great projects to go through!",

Since the project allows developers to use XRD's defi libraries and the Radix Engine to build their own DApps, it opens up a world of innovation from people with ideas. More developers contributing, more potential to find gems. I like to use Scrypto (to learn for now) for accessing Radix engine because it is written in Rust language and documentation is just \\[chef's kiss\\].\n\nThis is just an oversimplification but it is very robust and I'm definitely looking forward to that project's future and the developers using their ecosystem like myself.\n\nAnother gem which is very new but will offer another neat wallet idea is RoboInu Finance (RBIF). The person who started it was an ex-Google developer, and passed to an experienced software project lead, and she's been kicking ass, in my opinion. Since I'm really into community and collaboration, RBIF's culture has captured my interest. It's not about hyping, it's not about pumping, but about nourishing the community by continued support and offering solutions. RBIF has a special place in my heart. lol\n\nThe 2 products/solutions I'm very interested about are their flagship RoboWallet and RoboLaunchpad (which aligns with my interest for collaboration).\n\nRadixDLT is already a mature project while RoboInu Finance is still very very new. I think financially, you can gain a lot from RBIF in a year or 2. ;)",

The complexity of entering the crypto market for someone who has no knowledge about it. They will be the Apple of crypto. Make it so that a 75year old can easily be aware of projects and invest in them. \n\n2. Whale manipulations. How frustrated are we as retail investors to see whales draining profits over and over again. They hurt the chart. Well, Coyote Coin is implementing a Harpoon Tax to discourage whale dumps. If any wallet tries to sell more than 5% of the previous 24hr trading volume, the sell tax gets ratcheted up to about 33%, with 10% of that getting redistributed to holders.",

Profound scientific startups are generally not available to the public due to high barriers of entry and non existent deal flow; geography and accreditation sometimes present issues as well. For institutions, many early stage funds deal with an illiquid seed investment in which they are married to a company for many years before any liquidity event. Inventors with promising ideas are in need of expert advice, mentorship, licensing or corporate guidance, and lastly risk capital prior to proof of concept. The Science DAO will enable crypto investors to put their crypto value into a new asset. It will help funds gain access to new deal flow with the opinion of experts in those related industries without having to seek consultation. It would foster growth for inventors and entrepreneurs that are still in need for risk capital. It would take the pressure off single investors by mitigating risk through decentralized governance and fundraising.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nDon't miss out on this project as it will be HUGE!\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/theory/\r  \n\r  \nhttps://thesciencedao.io/\r  \n\r  \nhttps://thesciencedao.io/",
