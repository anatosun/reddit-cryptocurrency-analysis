                    "response": "A moderator needs to clean this thread up.  It's going to confuse many people that aren't familiar with every feature of a Ledger or how a Ledger works. \n\nFACT: There IS a legit Ledger Live exclusive app called Recovery Check that can be installed ON TO YOUR LEDGER FROM LEDGER LIVE ONLY in the exact same way one would install the bitcoin app or Ethereum app. \"App\" refers to the apps approved by Ledger, only available from Live. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO INSTALL AN \"APP\" FROM SOMETHING LIKE GOOGLE PLAY STORE. \n\nFACT: The ONLY way to install ANY LEDGER APPROVED APP is via Live Manager AND you must physically press both buttons when the device itself prompts you to allow Live to talk to the Ledger. This does NOT expose your private keys or recovery words to the internet or any other \"hot\" connection. \n\nFACT: When you buy a legit Ledger no apps are preinstalled. PERIOD. It's a blank slate.  If there IS an app on it then the device was tampered with prior to you receiving it. \n\nWhat this means is:\nA) If the OP is CERTAIN that he set up the device with a fresh seed phrase that the device itself generated (not any seed words that came with the device or that were already loaded up before he received it) then we know OP at some point after installing the Bitcoin app installed the Recovery Check app. \n\nB) If OP received a device that was already set up with apps and a 24 word seed and did not reset it right there, and only recalled the 24 words via the Recovery checker app or found a pre written card in the box then OP has been compromised since then. \n\nC) Regardless of A or B , Ledger Live Desktop also has a fail-safe that checks if the connected device is genuine. We do not know if the OP was aware of that or saw the msg that appears EVERY TIME YOU CONNECT that device is genuine. If it weren't, it would have screamed at him in red letters and been totally obvious.  If somehow that itself was tampered with then it would be a brand new, never before seen, active exploit of Ledger out in the wild.  This is highly unlikely. \n\nD) Everything could have been exactly correct, working as expected, brand new seed on legit device in 2020 up until today.  Just because he used recovery checker and lost funds some time after that, does NOT prove it was a bad app.  It could just be coincidence and OP is creating a Link that isn't there.  And maybe his 24 words were exposed by a user mistake or some person any time between 2020 and now. \n\nConclusion:\nOP got a used device from day 1 \nand never reset the recovery phrase and somehow there was a malicious app or whatever piggy backed on the device.  Then Live would have had to miss this and say device was genuine (which it very well could have been) There are too many things we don't know from OP to even speculate what could have been done. \nThis is full of holes \n\nOP could be a troll.  Because things don't add up and it would be such a sophisticated attack, the first one, first time, first person for just 0.7 BTC? nope.  \n\nLikely outcome - OP compromised his recovery phrase by mistake like EVERY OTHER SUPPOSED HACK of a Ledger. \nIt's Ochams Razor. It's too far fetched that OP somehow got a bad Recovery Checker app on his device WHILE ALSO not being flagged by the Live device and firmware check that happens every time you connect.   This would be catastrophic if it were true.  It's extremely unlikely. \n\nThis is a troll or basic user mishandling of recovery phrase.",

When you first get your brand new ledger, it randomly generates the 24 word seed which one writes down word for word. Then, the ledger will verify that you wrote down the seed phrase correctly by asking you what each of the 24 words are. Only by completing these two steps will you be able to complete the setup and start using your ledger.",

A Nano S is inexpensive (you can find them for $30-40 on ebay), and once you have checked that the device is genuine, it is safe to use it for recovery.\n\nAnd if you REALLY want to recover access without using another ledger, I would recommend using a phone wallet rather than a computer wallet, since they are considered safer (less malware on phones).",

As long as you\u2019re using their advanced trading tab on an actual computer and not on a mobile device (otherwise fees are higher). They seem to have the lowest fees and the closest bid/ask spreads. And they also give you 20 free crypto transfers per month. So you can buy your bitcoin on Gemini with very low fees, and then transfer the crypto to your Ledger wallet for free (20x per month). Hope this helps.",

All previous public addresses remain yours forever: you can re-use them, but it is recommended to use new ones for optimal privacy. Thus, you can have an infinite number of receiving addresses that are all linked to your account.\nhttps://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034336713?support=true\n\nOwning crypto assets comes down to managing private keys. Your private key is used to generate a public address that you can use to request a transaction one. Likewise, to send assets, you sign a transaction using the private key.\n\nAs blockchain networks like Bitcoin are public ledgers that record who owns what, your financial history could be easily analyzed if you were to re-use your public addresses. Fortunately, Ledger hardware wallets and Ledger Live automatically manage your private keys and public addresses to protect your privacy.\n\nTo conclude, you can receive funds in any of those addresses, but for privacy reasons, it is better to generate a new receiving address each time you receive funds in your account.\n\nTo learn more about Ledger hardware wallets, please refer to this article: https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000380313?docs=true\n\nI hope this better clarifies!",

You decide it\u2019s high time for a hardware wallet because you want to keep it safer, because it\u2019s actually worth something now, and you\u2019re a HODLer.\n\nBut, alas, gas fees / tokenomics / what have you are costly, to simply move your coins/tokens to a new wallet address.\n\nSo, now you do a quick risk/likelihood calculation: is the potential Risk of having had a seed phrase on a computer for a little bit of time greater than the potential loss via gas fees or what have you?\n\nRisk = Impact x Likelihood\n\nIf you think that the Likelihood that your personal computer has been at all compromised in the past 7 days or whatever is relatively low, it might be an ok move to switch the very same phrase to a hardware wallet, and wipe the phrase off the computer. It\u2019s not necessarily \u201cworthless\u201d to do so per se. Especially if you\u2019ve been careful, never visit shady sites or porn or whatever on that machine, and/or run a secure OS, and all that. It\u2019s like unprotected sex - you\u2019ll *probably* be ok and not get herpes. How careful are you? How well do you know her? Was this one-time, or a 2-month daily rabbit fest?\n\nOP will probably be ok, and moving a seed phrase from a computer to a hardware wallet, and then wiping the phrase from the computer, is statistically much safer than never using a hardware wallet at all. OP just reduced their risk surface exposure by doing this. Just not to 0, is all. Yes, 0 is best, and if OP can generate a new phrase on the hardware device, and then transfer their tokens from Metamask on their PC to it, that is optimal, you are correct.\n\nThere are gradients of Risk, is what I\u2019m saying. OP is probably fine. But, eyes open.",

                    "response": "The whole point of a Ledger is to only ever type the seed phrase in on the secure Ledger device which contains a hardware security module to protect your key and never touches the internet.\n\nMetamask is a hot wallet which is internet connected, if you use that seed on the Ledger you\u2019ve not got ANY additional protection by using a Ledger.\n\nTo remedy your issue leave the seed phrase in Metamask, reset the Ledger and generate a new seed phrase using the Ledger - do not take a photo of this phrase, do not store this phrase on a computer, do not put this phrase into Metamask, write it on paper and put it in a safe (or even better buy a steel wallet).\n\nThen send all crypto from Metamask to your newly generated Ethereum/ERC address on the ledger. Your Ethereum/ERC tokens are now secure.\n\nNow each blockchain has different methods of accessing it, Metamask is for Ethereum and Ethereum tokens (known as ERC-20) and a few other cryptocurrencies outside the scope of this post (Cronos/polygon/BSC) but does not cater for Bitcoin. You\u2019ll need to download a Bitcoin wallet such as electrum and set that wallet up with your old Metamask seed phrase in order to access your Bitcoin and to send this to a new Bitcoin address on your Ledger in order to protect your Bitcoin properly.\n\nHope this helps\n\nEDIT: to answer your further question re: seed phrases and Bitcoin:\n\nYou\u2019re correct, Bitcoin cannot be stored on Metamask BUT a seed phrase can be used to generate an address on nearly every chain because they are chain agnostic. Therefore whilst your Bitcoin can be stored on your \u201cMetamask seed phrase\u201d it can\u2019t be accessed via Metamask and you would need to access it as I outlined above.",

There are a lot of variations of audits, including what's in and out of scope, what are you trying to check etc. \n\nFor the most part however, think of an Audit as being a form of insurance. You're sampling processes to make sure that the company in question has sufficient controls in place that you rely on what they are saying.\n\nSo, in the case of our bitcoin wallet, this might look something like this:\n\n1. How does the bitcoin \"get\" into the wallet? What's the transaction the company is conducting that generates that bitcoin.\n2. Let's say that's for selling widgets. Alright, let's pull the original purchase order / sale to the customer for the widget. Maybe we even go back and check the original order we had for the widget. Company is required to keep good records of the widgets in and out, do we have those?\n3. Great! We can see you bought a widget for $x, you sold it to a customer for $y and that you accepted the payment in Bitcoin which you put into wallet Z. I have documented steps along each set of the way that give me confidence that you actually legitimately accumulate bitcoin.\n4. There should also be a ledger that contains the transactions, I'm guessing in this instance, BitCoin is treated a bit like a Forex transaction, but ultimately I've got an entry in my book that's showing the coming and goings of my bitcoin.\n5. Can I find that transaction on the Bitcoin ledger? You said on Date Y you put 0.21 BTC in there... do I see that transaction?\n6. All there! Great, OK now your book says you should have 10 BTC in that wallet. There's 10 BTC there, perfect! All good, no need to dig further - we've sampled the process that generates BTC, we've looked at a few transactions, we've checked your records that say you have 10BTC and you can show us there is 10BTC. We're all good here!\n7. If there's a mismatch - your records say 10BTC but there's actually only 8BTC, well we are going to dig a lot further. Is it fraud, is it incompetence?? Where did the missing 2BTC go...\n\nAnyway, TLDR, the company doesn't need to demonstrate it can physically access the wallet, in needs to demonstrate that it has processes and systems in place and records that match what we can physically see happening in that wallet.\n\nAs to how the company manages their wallet and the keys, this is a great question that I have no clue as to the answer - but I hope this answers it from the audit perspective.",

It might be helpful to break down what's happening here.  Ledger Live is asking your device for a bunch of DOGE addresses, and then it goes off to a backend service somewhere on the internet to ask a Dogecoin blockchain node whether that account has any assets associated with it.  This backend service appears to be passing back a `<` character unexpectedly.  Hence the \"unexpected <\" message.\n\nI just checked with multiple of my own accounts and didn't hit this message, so there's either something about one of your accounts that causes this service to fail, or you just got unlucky and the service was overloaded or down at the time you checked.  Trying again a couple of times could eliminate the \"unlucky\" aspect, which it sounds like you've done multiple times.\n\nIf it's related to a specific Dogecoin account but not others, it might help with debugging to try calling the backend service directly by putting that address into this URL:  \n[https://explorers.api.live.ledger.com/blockchain/v3/doge/addresses/ADDRESS\\_HERE/transactions](https://explorers.api.live.ledger.com/blockchain/v3/doge/addresses/ADDRESS_HERE/transactions)\n\nIf that returns an error, I'd love to see a snippet or screenshot.",

For Solana there are like 5 wallets that support Ledger devices.  If none existed, you could (theoretically) write the interface yourself.\n\nDoge appears to be one of those coins though where there aren't actually a ton of pre-made wallet applications that support the blockchain, and for those that do, they haven't added support for Ledger devices.  This makes it extremely inconvenient when Ledger Live breaks.  Still though, there's always a way out of this situation without needing Ledger (the company)'s help.

So when people buy Bitcoin do they have it online for a couple minutes until they can transfer their keys to Ledger?\n\nNo, your private leys never leave your ledger. Your ledger is able to sign your transactions without exposing your seed. The only thing that gets in-line on the computer are your public address and your signed transaction (which is eventually stored on the blockchain, once confirmed by the network. Neither of those put your assets at risks.\n\n\\> Couple years back I bought some Bitcoin only to make a small purchase online.\n\nHope the weed was good!\n\n  \n\\>  I had just a tiny bit of Change left but don\u2019t exactly remember how much. I saved a txt document with 2 keys in them. I didn\u2019t mark them as private/public/wallet or anything. Just two strings of characters. I want to see what the balance is, if any. How do I see if there\u2019s any Bitcoin left? Is there a way to determine which of the 2 keys I have is the private or public?\n\nAssuming you used legacy BTC addresses, Your public BTC address starts with 1, and your private key starts with K or L (keep this one private!).\n\nTo check your balance, enter your public address (starting with 1) on a BTC blockchain explorer, like [https://blockchair.com/fr/bitcoin](https://blockchair.com/fr/bitcoin) (doing this is safe).",

You should first try to send out your funds from an interface other than Ledger Live to a temporary wallet before attempting to update the firmware.\n\n- For BTC, you can try using Electrum wallet to see if you can find your funds and perform the necessary transactions. Since your firmware is outdated, you can try using your Ledger device in conjunction with an older version of Electrum.\n\ufeff\n- For ETH and ERC-20 tokens, MyCrypto desktop application is an option as they might support Ledger devices with older firmware.\n\ufeff\nFor other crypto-assets, I would recommend trying compatible third-party wallets, the list for which you can find here: https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets\n\ufeff\nIf none of these solutions work, your last solution is to update your Ledger device firmware with the risk that it gets reset during the process, and thus you lose access to your funds.

These things, unfortunately, take more time as other projects set their own timelines.\n \nA partial support was already developed by Andrew Chow in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI (merged just a few days ago), which will probably be released soon; HWI is used by bitcoin-core and several other software wallets, so that release will already bring an improved support \u2212 but support for policy registration will be partial and therefore a bit inconvenient to use.\n\nWe'll definitely make another blog post once we have a full integration.",

                    "response": "It is possible to recover at least Bitcoin and Ethereum relatively easily.\n\nFor Bitcoin:\n\nAll BTC accounts created with ledger devices with Bitcoin app version 1.0.2 and later can be recovered using Electrum, connected to the ledger device.\n\nOn win 10/11, you may have to run Electrum in admin mode (right-click the Electrum icon, then select Run as administrator). Also make sure to close Ledger Live.\n\nMake sure your ledger device is connected, unlocked, and in the Bitcoin app (make sure that \"Browser Support is OFF in the Bitcoin app settings). In Electrum, follow: new account > standard account > use hardware device > select your ledger > select \"legacy\", then Next.\n\nThis will go to legacy account #0, i.e. derivation path m/44'/0'/0'\n\nIf your account is segwit (addresses start with \"3\") or native segwit type (addresses start with \"bc1q\"), select \"p2sh-segwit\" or \"native segwit\" instead of \"legacy\".\n\nIf you have multiple BTC legacy accounts (or if your account is not account #0), you can reach your other accounts by changing the derivation path to m/44'/0'/n' (where n is the account number). E.g. to reach account #1, use m/44'/0'/1' . The account number is the 3rd number in the derivation path (this is also true with p2sh-segwit and native segwit accounts).\n\n\\-----\n\nFor Ethereum and ERC20 tokens, recovery can be done using custom low-level tools, read:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/kz2eob/successful\\_recovery\\_story\\_how\\_we\\_recovered\\_100/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/kz2eob/successful_recovery_story_how_we_recovered_100/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/nbcukn/nano\\_s\\_with\\_12\\_firmware\\_vs\\_eip155\\_successful/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/nbcukn/nano_s_with_12_firmware_vs_eip155_successful/)\n\n\\-----\n\nFor Litecoin and Ripple, recovery is likely possible but would require even more efforts, so it depends how much you have on your accounts, as it may not be worth the recovery efforts.\n\nFido U2F is an app unrelated with crypto (it's for signing in securely on some systems, like yubikey), so you can ignore it.",

It should definitely handle your needs.  Plus you can hook it up to something like metamask if you want to hold more erc20 tokens someday.  \n\nNano x can hold a crap ton.",

The seed determines all addresses that can be made (deterministic wallet) . So it doesn't matter if you add an account in Ledger live or not, they are already there - used or not. By adding account in Ledger live you are only telling the wallet which addresses you want to use out of dozens available. You can delete the account in Ledger live and then set it up again, if there was a balance, it will still be there.\n\nI've written an [article about basics of seed phrases](https://getcoinplate.com/en_US/blog/Is-a-seed-phrase-the-same-as-a-private-key-The-ultimate-guide-to-private-keys-and-recovery-seed-phrases/7?utm_source=reddit.com&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=r1)  that could be helpful to get a better grasp of how this all works.",

The \"verifying\" step is important because it allows you to verify if the address displayed on your computer's screen (which is not safe, and which can potentially be compromised by malware) is the same as the address safely derived by your ledger device from your private key. \n\nYou should always trust what is displayed on your Ledger's screen, as what it displayed is safely restricted by the Secure Element of your Nano device. \n\nSending coins to a recipient address A (generated in Ledger Live), that you have not verified on your Ledger's screen, could result in a loss only in the scenario where a malware had swapped your real address with the hacker's address (by exploiting your computer weaknesses). \n\nHope that answers your question \ud83d\ude03\n\nMore on that: \nhttps://blog.ledger.com/trusted-display/",

Also make sure to close Ledger Live.\n\nMake sure your ledger device is connected, unlocked, and in the Bitcoin app (make sure that \"Browser Support is OFF in the Bitcoin app settings). In Electrum, follow: new account > standard account > use hardware device > select your ledger > select \"legacy\", then Next.\n\nThis will go to legacy account #0, i.e. derivation path m/44'/0'/0'\n\nIf your account is segwit (addresses start with \"3\") or native segwit type (addresses start with \"bc1q\"), select \"p2sh-segwit\" or \"native segwit\" instead of \"legacy\".\n\nIf you have multiple BTC legacy accounts (or if your account is not account #0), you can reach your other accounts by changing the derivation path to m/44'/0'/n' (where n is the account number). E.g. to reach account #1, use m/44'/0'/1' . The account number is the 3rd number in the derivation path (this is also true with p2sh-segwit and native segwit accounts)",

                    "response": "regarding 5, one thing to understand that your seed doesn't just generate a single BTC address, it generates a string of addresses. Ledger Live saves all of the public keys as they are calculated from the Ledger, so it can total them all up to find out what is in the whole wallet. So it's not that your public address is changing, but rather you're pulling the next one from the string. (of course, the private keys never leave the Ledger.)\n\nThe seed is the only thing that relates the addresses in the string. If you give a single public address to someone, then they can only see the transaction history of that address, not of the entire wallet.\n \nYou can generate a new address whenever you want, and if you ever have to restore a Ledger from its seed, it knows how to make the entire string of addresses, so all of your funds will be accessible.\n\nThere are so many possible addresses that everyone can create a new address, uniquely, for each and every transaction, and some people do that. But others generate a single address and re-use it:\n\n- You can give a single address to a single person or vendor, and you will know that any funds sent to that address came from that source.\n- You can set up a single address as a trusted withdrawal address at your exchange, and lock it. Now, even if someone hacks into your account, they will only be able to send funds to the withdrawal address",

                    "response": "hey, others have given very good answers here, but I'd like to also emphasise that not \"keeping all your eggs in one basket\" is a good strategy - theoretically having everything in one hardware-wallet secured address is good, but in the off-chance your seed phrase is discovered then you lose it all.    if it was me (mildly paranoid)  I'd likely split that million dollars into smaller chunks and distribute across multiple cold wallets.  it's up to you to decide what your risk threshold is.\n\nThere's also advantages to keeping some on centralised exchanges, namely you can in some cases be guaranteed by the exchange against loss, have additional flexibility in terms of rapidly buying selling rather than having to send from your wallet, and have access to other staking options that may not be available via ledger live.\n\npersonally I have my crypto spread across 3 exchanges (different advantages/disadvantages of each) and one hardware wallet.   I have two ledger devices (one X, one S) with the same seed phrase, this is in-case one is disabled, lost or stolen I can still move my funds with the other.\n\nfor me, I value redundancy, risk reduction, and flexibility.   you need to decide what you value and how best to achieve it.",

They are always stored on the blockchains, on the Internet.\n\nThe only thing stored in your ledger is your seed (24 words + optional passphrase), i.e. your master private key that gives you full control of all the accounts derived from this seed.\n\nThe apps on the ledger are just needed for the ledger to understand the blockchains. Your cryptos are not stored in the apps.\n\nIn fact, you can remove and re-install the ledger apps at will, this has NO EFFECT on your crypto accounts and balances, which are on the blockchains (not in the ledger).\n\nTo learn the basic concepts of crypto and how the ledger works, you should read and study all the pages here: [https://www.ledger.com/academy](https://www.ledger.com/academy) .",

Custodial means you leave your coins on an exchange. This has its pros and cons but this is another topic. Custodial eallets are hot and cold wallets. Hot wallets are those where your recovery seed is generated and then stored on a device which is connected to the internet. Cold wallet is one where the recovery seed is generated and stored offline (nowadays mostly on a device like ledger). This means that cold wallets are much safer but using them requires a bit more a time.\n\nSo after this your questions\n\n1 - what you mean here is that nobody will have access to your private keys, because they are stored offline. \n\n2 - never do this. You will make a hot wallet from your cold wallet this way. You should only enter your seed in another hardware device. Both wallets (metamask and terra) have options to sync them with your ledger.\n\n3 - you can check your funds in ledger live without connecting the device to your computer.\n\n4 - unfortunately ledger nano s has limited memory so you basically always have to delete/install apps. You can only use apps that are installed currently but that doesnt mean for example you lose your btc if you delete btc app. This only means that you cant send btc as long as the btc app is not installed again.",

                    "response": "These are all great questions, and some good answers in the thread already.  I'll take a shot at them too.\n\n\\`1. The Ledger gives you a mechanism to generate a seed phrase offline, off a computer, and allows you to *keep it that way* forever.  As long as you keep up your end of the deal, your seed phrase will stay safe.  You're right that attackers could still ask you for your seed phrase (and they will!), but they'll never get it from you unless you intentionally give it to them.  Obviously you won't do that. \n\nYou also can use your Ledger to sign transactions with malicious scam applications.  These scam applications will try to trick you into signing away your valuables to them while you're not paying attention.  Even if fall for one of these tricks, the signature itself occurs safely and securely, and in no way exposes your seed phrase to anyone.   A single scam transaction can't wipe out your entire account either.  It can take something valuable from you though which can be still cause pain.\n\nLedger tries to protect you from this by putting as many safe-signing features as possible into Ledger Live.  The NFT features, for example, let you transfer NFTs in a way that very clearly shows you on your Ledger's screen what's going on every step of the way.  Lots more features to come, but for now being careful with what you're signing is good practice.\n\n2. Ledger seed phrases follow a standard called BIP39, which is the same standard used by every hardware and software wallet provider.  This means that your seed phrase is ultimately portable, and you could take your ledger-generated seed phrase and import it into Metamask, or import it into a competing hardware wallet, no problem.  Your seed phrase is all you need to transact your assets on the blockchain, which means if it falls into the wrong hands, or gets exposed to a computer with malware, you're flirting with disaster.  I would never recommend you put your seed phrase into a computer for any reason ever.  To answer your question directly though, it is possible.\n\n3. Absolutely.   Zerion and Rainbow are both mobile apps that let you \"watch\" wallet addresses without needing your Ledger around.  You can't transact with watched addresses, but it does a great job at monitoring them.  Zerion can be set up to push-notify you anytime anything happens with the wallet address that you're watching which is really handy for monitoring for anything funky going on (or if you're someone who gets gifted assets pretty often!).  Rainbow is really great a showcasing your NFT collection on the go.  [Zapper.fi](https://Zapper.fi) is also a great website that lets you track your portfolio if you do a lot of DeFi.  Plenty of applications to choose from, and they're all totally fine watching Ledger-based accounts, no problem!\n\n4. The Ledger \"apps\" are often misunderstood, and frankly not well explained by our current literature.  The way to think of the apps as simply teaching your device how to talk to a given blockchain.  The Terra app teaches it how to talk to Terra, the Ethereum app teaches it how to talk to Ethereum.  You can add and remove them at will, and your accounts will always be there waiting for you when you reinstall the app later.  This is because your accounts are tied to your seed phrase, which remains on the device no matter which apps are installed at any given moment.  Feel free to swap apps out whenever/wherever you'd like :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but some great questions and I wanted to get you some good answers!",

Are there any benefits to having a coin being supported by ledger live besides the chart? is it more secure or anything?",

They just live together in the UI, but when you use the Ledger accounts, you need the Ledger device present for doing the signing part of the deal.

I hold NFTs on Solana, Harmony, Ethereum, Polygon, and probably a couple more chains using an account backed up on my Nano S.  The \"compatibility\" here specifically refers to Ledger Live.\n\nThe NFT features in Ledger Live allow you to send NFTs using what we call \"clear signing\" which is where it shows you precisely the collection name that you're transferring on the Nano's screen while you're accepting that transaction.  The NFT clear-signing features in Ledger Live don't work on the Nano S, due to its limited capacity to be able to store all of those NFT collections' info.  The S Plus supports clear signing just fine, just like the X.\n\nWhen you connect your Ledger to Metamask, you can use your Ledger account to do *literally anything* Metamask can do.  Connect your Nano S to metamask using the \"connect hardware wallet\" option in the menu, switch Metamask over to the BSC network, and use your favorite NFT marketplace on BSC to buy, sell, or manage your NFTs with your Ledger accounts.\n\nI do have videos on Metamask setup ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y51\\_Baq1\\_nc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y51_Baq1_nc)) as well as understanding how to use other networks like Polygon and BSC ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMBQ3BpTBeQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMBQ3BpTBeQ)).  Hopefully those 2 videos together can show you how powerful Ledger + Metamask actually is.",

In order to clear sign for NFTs, the device has to be aware of which smart contract addresses map to which collection.  So like, the fact that `0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d` is the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT.  This additional information makes the Ethereum app quite a bit larger, and the S is very limited as far as storage capacity.\n\nThe S Plus and X have the same amount of capacity, and it's *more than enough* for those devices to not get outdated anytime soon.  Honestly the fact that the S is still as capable as it is goes to show how future-proof these new devices will be.  The S is *fully* capable of doing the basics, and with Metamask there are no limitations.  As more and more contract data gets pushed to the nano though to enable safe clear-signing, I can imagine the S may start to show its age more and more.  Even then, the way we're doing most of that though the Discover apps means the S will probably continue to stay equally as safe and as capable as the rest. \n\nHowever, If you're debating now between the S and the S Plus, definitely go with the Plus",

You should first try to send out your funds from an interface other than Ledger Live to a temporary wallet before attempting to update the firmware.\n\n- For BTC, you can try using Electrum wallet to see if you can find your funds and perform the necessary transactions. Since your firmware is outdated, you can try using your Ledger device in conjunction with an older version of Electrum.\n\ufeff\n- For ETH and ERC-20 tokens, MyCrypto desktop application is an option as they might support Ledger devices with older firmware.\n\ufeff\nFor other crypto-assets, I would recommend trying compatible third-party wallets, the list for which you can find here: https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets\n\ufeff\nIf none of these solutions work, your last solution is to update your Ledger device firmware with the risk that it gets reset during the process, and thus you lose access to your funds. Instructions for updating firmware on Ledger Nano S and for Ledger Nano X can be found in the hyperlinks.\n\ufeff\nThe 24-word recovery phrase is only displayed once during the set-up process. You are the only one to have ever seen them, and they cannot be displayed anymore. Anyone with access to your 24-word recovery phrase can take ownership of your assets.\n\ufeff",

Also make sure to close Ledger Live.\n\nMake sure your ledger device is connected, unlocked, and in the Bitcoin app (make sure that \"Browser Support is OFF in the Bitcoin app settings). In Electrum, follow: new account > standard account > use hardware device > select your ledger > select \"legacy\", then Next.\n\nThis will go to legacy account #0, i.e. derivation path m/44'/0'/0'\n\nIf your account is segwit (addresses start with \"3\") or native segwit type (addresses start with \"bc1q\"), select \"p2sh-segwit\" or \"native segwit\" instead of \"legacy\".\n\nIf you have multiple BTC legacy accounts (or if your account is not account #0), you can reach your other accounts by changing the derivation path to m/44'/0'/n' (where n is the account number). E.g. to reach account #1, use m/44'/0'/1' . The account number is the 3rd number in the derivation path (this is also true with p2sh-segwit and native segwit accounts).\n\n\\-----\n\nFor Ethereum and ERC20 tokens, recovery can be done using custom low-level tools, read:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/kz2eob/successful\\_recovery\\_story\\_how\\_we\\_recovered\\_100/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/kz2eob/successful_recovery_story_how_we_recovered_100/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/nbcukn/nano\\_s\\_with\\_12\\_firmware\\_vs\\_eip155\\_successful/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/nbcukn/nano_s_with_12_firmware_vs_eip155_successful/)\n\n\\-----\n\nFor Litecoin and Ripple, recovery is likely possible but would require even more efforts, so it depends how much you have on your accounts, as it may not be worth the recovery efforts.\n\nFido U2F is an app unrelated with crypto (it's for signing in securely on some systems, like yubikey), so you can ignore it.",

Hopefully the PIN is something stupid like 0000, 1234, 5555, 1313 or 6969. And I would advise you to NOT try any PIN, as you could reset the ledger and be very sorry you did that: read the rest of my post first!\n\nNote that a message can be posted on the blockchain, to the address in question, to inform the account owner that their ledger has been found, and provide a way to contact the person who fount it e.g. via email, so that they can give privately info to prove that they were the original ledger owner (e.g. by describing how they wrote the address on the device etc).\n\nSending a message on the blockchain can be done by anyone, they just need to know the address. Note that the message will be public and anyone who knows the address will be able to see it on the blockchain. If the address had large amount of cryptos, I would definitely do that, because there is a possibility that the ledger owner lost their seed phrase, and the actual ledger would be the only way they can recover access.\n\nIf that's the case, the ledger owner could reward you with a nice bounty. So do NOT destroy this ledger! And do NOT try PIN's as wrong PINs will cause the ledger to reset.\n\nWas it and ETH address or a BTC address?",

Connect your device and install every app that support Ledger Live on the Nano. Create an account for every cryptocurrency. Then, sync your data from Ledger Live on the computer to Ledger Live on your phone (currently, only computer to mobile is supported, the other way around isn't).   \n&nbsp;  \n\nDoing it this way, you have a few advantages:  \n\n- It's easier to manage the Nano device on a computer compared to a mobile device.  \n- If anything happens on your mobile and your Ledger Live app data is deleted or the app is reset, you can easily just export your data from computer to mobile using the QR code. It prevents having to do all the manual setup again.  \n- I assume your using your phone more than your computer, so you can more easily check the status of your coins on your phone.",

As the private keys prove that you're the owner of the coins, that's all that's needed to access your coins. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe apps allow you to interact with these private keys. When you install the Ethereum app for example, you can interact with all your Ethereum accounts and the addresses tied to these accounts. An app itself does not store your coinsl; the apps check your private keys and know which addresses are yours, and allow you to send and receive coins. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen you need to interact with a cryptocoin (either on Ledger Live or another wallet client like MetaMask), you can install the app and make your transactions. So, you can install the Ethereum app, do your thing, and then if needed delete it. By deleting the app, you do not delete any of your coins, you only delete the app that makes it possible to interact with the coins. Your coins are tied to the private keys, and those stay 'stored' on the Ledger even after you delete an app.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, if you need to install an app, but you don't have the required space on your Ledger device, just make space available by deleting on or more of the installed apps. And then install the app that you need.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you notice that you need many apps installed at a time, you can upgrade to the Nano X; that one can handle many more apps at once. You can also wait for the Nano S Plus, which is not yet available. The Nano S is the improved version of  the regular S that has more space available for the apps.",

BTC derivation paths depend on the type of account (legacy, segwit or native segwit), e.g. for legacy account #n, the derivation path is m/44'/0'/n' for the extended public key of the account.",

                    "response": "This is a little tricky, but basically most well known cryptocurrencies use the same standards for HD wallets and use the same SEED PHRASE (usually 24 words from the BIP39 word list). But each cryptocurrency uses a different \"derivation path\", which just means they start with the same SEED but make some different choices in how to generate the private keys and addresses under that seed. You usually won't have to think about his and can just use the same SEED for all of your crypto.\n\nOnce in a while you may find an unusual cryptocurrency that doesn't use the same standards or even more confusing a wallet that doesn't use the same derivation path as most wallets. In that case you could restore your seed to a different wallet and have a bit of a panic when you don't see you coins. But they are still there, you would just have to manually look up and enter the \"derivation path\" that the original wallet used.\n\nIf the coin and wallet state they use the standards you should be fine. The standard generally referred to as \"HD-Wallets\" is also known as BIP-32, BIP-39 and BIP-44. If your wallet and coin use those they should be compatible.\n\nAnd certainly if you are sticking to one wallet or device you shouldn't have any problem using ONE seed for all of your coins, even if you replace that wallet or device with another from the same vendor.",

Your seed is basically your master private key, and it gives access to all your crypto accounts. that's why it is so important to protect it from unauthorized access and from accidental destruction.\n\nit's a bit hard to comprehend, but your 24 words actually \"contains\" all your private keys.",

It can break or malfunction at any time, it is disposable and replaceable. \r  \n\r  \nThe safety of all your funds really depends on how safe you keep your seed (24 words + optional passphrase), backed-up in physical form (e.g. on paper) safe from unauthorized access and from accidental destruction / loss.

Of course, it's only exploitable because Ledger failed to protect customer data. But that's done. There's nothing anyone can do about that anymore. So the options we're left with is rising awareness and educating people. And we know how well that worked in the past when it comes to mass adoption. I mean: we've been trying for 30 years to educate people about _basic_ security concepts like the importance of using strong password and yet \"1234password\" remains one of the most common.\n\nI don't suggest we should do nothing. But I'm a realistic person: we'll probably see users failing to understand the concept and losing cryptos forever, no matter what we do.\n\nSo:\n\n- Make it easy to find the most important safty measures when it comes to Ledger usage\n- Limit them to what's absolutely important which increases the chance people will read them\n- Use different methods of transport: text, videos and so on, accessible from the same and only source of truth: ledger.com \n- Protect ledger.com at any cost\n- Sticky the link to those information in every plattform / channel about Ledger\n\nAnd that's it.

I assume they have manufactured a bad batch and released it knowing or not knowing this issue existed, but Ledger should be transparent and communicate there is an issue that is being resolved asap. I chose a Ledger knowing they were hacked with personal data taken.  And now a major battery issue with poor communication to resolve it.  I\u2019m keeping mine for now but will follow closely to see how this turns out. Good luck everyone and keep us posted.",

You can setup to use a hardware key and or Google Authenticator, but [if you provide a recovery phone # then your hardware key is useless](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/183723). The fact that someone can reset a password or regain access to an account with only a phone # is super concerning",

Re-using passwords.  \nOf course entering the seed for a hardware wallet in any digital form is a very bad idea, but that generally has to be combined with at least one more bad practice to result in a loss, and password re-use is a big one, so i try to mention it whenever an opportunity arises.  \n  \nOP might have what he calls \"my password\", and uses that one password for everything. It's absolutely shocking how many people use a password for more than one site. It was a terrible idea even in the 90's, and it's just plain stupid now.  \n  \nSo maybe he used his one and only password to setup his icloud account, and his google account, and his ebay account, and his paypal account, and his bank account, and his teamviewer account, and literally everything else.  \n  \nThen one of those sites (that has bad security practices) gets their database stolen, and some hacker runs a script that uses the credentials in that database to try to log in to whatever he thinks is the most common site that everyone uses. Then he finds one that works, so he starts using that set of credentials to log into every popular site, and a lot of them work. At that point it's just a guessing game to find out what sites OP uses, and when he finds one, he's pretty much guaranteed to get in. But no doubt some of the first sites he tries will be google, apple, paypal, and teamviewer. He gets into google and apple, starts looking through photos, and finds the pic of OP's seed phrase (which OP is probably not being truthful about), and steals his crypto. Then he goes to paypal and steals cash. Then he tries teamviewer for the possible big score of literally everything OP has.  \n  \nIt wouldn't be at all surprising if OP starts discovering a lot of other accounts have been compromised.  \n  \nPeople, don't re-use passwords. Seriously bad idea that will almost certainly result in some sort of loss at some point.",

This is much more unlikely then a iCloud hack depending on how accessible your seed written down was.\n\nNext time don't take screenshots or photos of your seed, keep them entirely offline.\n\nThe ledger has slightly better security then a software wallet like trust wallet, because if the phone gets hacked, they can access the software wallet, but not your hardware wallet, but if you store your seed digitally like in a photo, you undermine the security of a hardware wallet so essentially both wallets act as software wallets.",

Maybe not for the explicit purpose of stealing your cryptos, but assume your device isn't all that safe. I conducted a study over 10 years where I collected cracks from all kinds of software. Over time, all ended up scanning with some kind of trojan or worm. At first, those maybe not be detected by antivirus, but that's only because there were no signatures in the database for them. As the crack gets older, the virus it carries has more of a chance of being catalogued, and detected. But I digress.",

                    "response": "Ok, so here's an easy/familiar way to visualise how ledger works:\n\nStep back to the 80's. You've got a bank account, and a chequebook. You can view your bank balances (blockchain), and put money into your bank account (crypto address) at any time - but in order to spend anything, you need to complete a cheque (a transaction), and authorise that cheque with your special rubber stamp (your private key).\n\nIf someone finds your chequebook (wallet), they can't spend anything without your special rubber stamp. But if you leave your rubber stamp around to be found, then they're free to spend your money.\n\nSo, if you use a \"conventional\" crypto wallet, you're carrying that rubber stamp around with you in your pocket. If you leave it somewhere, someone can use it. By employing a hardware wallet, you're basically building a little secure building with a service window, with a person behind a bulletproof glass counter assigned to stamp your transactions. \n\nWhen you set up your ledger, you go to the window next door and they give you a totally random and unique seed phrase/private key. The person behind the stamp window takes that seed/PK and makes a unique custom stamp from it, and keeps it. This person doesn't know ANYTHING about your accounts or balances - they just know the secret/method (BTC/ETH/XXX apps) to signing your transactions, and they know to do it only if the window is open (ledger is unlocked), **and** you say \"sign this please\" (confirming on the hardware).\n\nEvery time you want to spend some money, you write up the cheque (transaction), and then take it to the stamping window for approval. The person behind the window makes sure it's all OK, and stamps the transaction, but this of course can only happen if the shop is open. You then take that cheque (signed transaction) and post it off (tx to blockchain) to the person you're paying. Because this rubber stamp is locked away securely, and you can only retrieve the *result* (signature) of a stamp and not the stamp's blueprint (seed/PK), no one else will be able to reproduce or steal your stamp. People can see your historical cheque stubs, but they can't write a cheque.\n\nThink of your ledger like the president - he doesn't know EVERYTHING that's going on in the whitehouse, but needs to permit things to happen. Many bills and measures need his approval, and so we keep him safe surrounded by guards and a big secure house. Loads of stuff happens all around him that he doesn't know about, but when a staffer comes along with a document that needs signing, they take it to him, he signs it, and the measure is put forward. No one else can sign that document - doing so would invalidate it.",

You should never enter it into a computer, only the device itself. And never give it to anybody who asks for it.

Many people have lost access to their accounts by using the bip39 passphrase without fully understanding it.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/kmq68s/psa\\_learn\\_the\\_importance\\_of\\_your\\_24word\\_seed/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/kmq68s/psa_learn_the_importance_of_your_24word_seed/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/kw5chn/learn\\_more\\_about\\_the\\_bip39\\_passphrase\\_sometimes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/kw5chn/learn_more_about_the_bip39_passphrase_sometimes/)\n\n\\>  Also, when am I required to input the 24 key? Ever since I plugged it into my PC, when I unplug and plug it back in, I seem to be able to just access everything.\n\nyou should NEVER input them in anything else than a hardware wallet (e.g. a new nano, or in case your nano resets). Never take a photo of the words, never type them on a keyboard or enter then on your phone, never send them by mail (even to yourself), never store them in a computer file or on the cloud.\n\nAnd you should understand the basics:\n\nYour cryptos are not in your ledger.  They are on the blockchains, on the Internet.\n\nThe only important thing in your ledger is your seed (24 words), i.e. your master private key that gives you full control of all the accounts derived from this seed.\n\nThe apps on the ledger are just needed for the ledger to communicate with the blockchains. You can remove and re-install them at will, this has no effect on your cryptos, which are on the blockchains (not in the ledger).\n\nYou can control hundreds of different coins with your Ledger Nano S, if you want to.\n\nThe ledger is just a small electronic gadget that stores your seed in a safe way (it cannot be extracted from the ledger), and that allows you to sign your transactions without risking to expose your seed.  It can break or malfunction at any time, it is disposable and replaceable.\n\nThe safety of all your funds really depends on how safe you keep your seed (24 words + optional passphrase), safe from unauthorized access and from accidental destruction / loss.",

I personally know this one is safe, but you can't trust me, so do not use it online. Save and run it from your PC. **Safest option would be to create an Ubuntu Live-Boot USB, disconnect from the internet and boot the live USB to load the HTML file, to ensure you don't have any keyloggers etc watching.** Remember, this goes against the recommendation of typing your word phrase into a PC, so PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO YOUR PRIVACY.\n\nOnce you enter your 24 word phrase, you can select the appropriate crypto/token from the dropdown box, and your generated addresses will be displayed based on the BIP44 derivation path. With little previous use, you'll likely not need to check past the first few. Also make sure you check account 0-4, if you were using more than the first account space on your ledger.\n\nYou can check each one of these addresses manually on the different blockchain explorers to verify your coins and tokens are still there.\n\n**If your assets aren't under any of the listed addresses and there are no transactions sending them out, you may have accidentally recorded or entered your seed phrase incorrectly.**",

But, once you sell that 1 BTC, let's say, 50k then you'll need to declare the sale.",

If you still want to keep the details of your crypto assets secret, it's better to setup a revocable trust now and put the crypto in there. You then list the beneficiaries inside the trust document. The advantage is that trusts are not required to be made public, so 3rd parties won't have any information about your assets even after you die, and your beneficiaries can inherit without everyone else knowing how much they received. \n\nTalk to an estate & trusts lawyer about setting this up, it should be relatively inexpensive.\n\nYou also want to create a well-written guide for your beneficiaries on how they will actually access your crypto. And maybe run through some drills with them so they will have some idea on what they should do in the event of your death.",

Like Terra being ERC20 only on their platform, or a notable omission of ALGO and ATOM. The free gas is amazing though, and I\u2019ve never had issues, so I recommend. \n\nCrypto.com isn\u2019t cheap by any means; withdrawal fees are sometimes ridiculous. But they support way more networks like MATIC, AVAX, ATOM, ADA, XLM, etc. There\u2019s a pretty annoying spread on top of it, which makes it more annoying. If you live outside of the states they have a Crypto.com Exchange which isn\u2019t as bad on the fees. But there\u2019s a ton of versatility, and typically the fees for withdrawing on the more \u201cniche\u201d networks (ones Gemini doesn\u2019t cover) aren\u2019t expensive, so it\u2019s not pricy. \n\nI technically do have Coinbase as well, but because Crypto.com and Gemini cover my needs, i tend to not really use it.

A Nano S is inexpensive (you can find them for $30-40 on ebay), and once you have checked that the device is genuine, it is safe to use it for recovery.\n\nAnd if you REALLY want to recover access without using another ledger, I would recommend using a phone wallet rather than a computer wallet, since they are considered safer (less malware on phones).",

Bomb Shelter\n\nSince you are traveling and not moving, keep your primary backup in your bomb shelter (or whatever).  You should always have a \"safe spot\" resistant to fire and others stuff to keep your primary backup\n\n### 2. Split Scramble Cipher (24 word only)\n\nRecode your crypto steel into a split scramble cipher.  First take your 24 words seed-mnemonic and six-word-passphrase (if enabled) to have an ordered list of 30 words (or 24).  Below each word write down it's order in the list (1,2,3 ... 30) to give you a 2x30 matrix.  Now scramble the 30 columns using a computer generated randomizer (humans are the worst).\n\nThe top row is now your scrambled word list and it can be encoded back into cryptosteel.  Your bottom row are the order decoder and it can be used to put your list back in order.  You can store your order list in a password manager or just email it to your self.  Your cryptosteel can be kept in your luggage.  Someone would need BOTH your words and the order to reconstitute your key.  EVEN YOU.\n\nThe cipher is sufficiently impervious to most any attack, so long as we are dealing with a 24-word seed.  It is NOT safe for 12 or 18 word seeds.  I assume the reader gets this far and understand the difference between 12-factorial and 24-factorial.\n\n### 3. Personal Memory (your mind)\n\nLet the hate begin.  Yes, I believe people should memorize their seed mnemonic.  That is the root of the word \"mnemonic\".  It is a WILDLY unpopular opinion, but I still believe it is critical for any serious investor.",

As long as you have a steel copy stored somewhere secure in case of head injury or memory loss, I don't see a downside.  I memorized my 24-word phrase in less than half an hour... Easier than some grade school tests I took way back in the day.  Haven't even looked at or needed my steel copy since then as a result.  I agree with you completely that memorization is a great backup when combined with #1 and 2 on your list.",

Guess because it's hard.  Mostly because it's unreliable.  But like you, I think having a 60% reliable second-level backup is better than having no second-level backup at all.\n\nOhh well.  People loose their seeds all the time, and it doesn't effect me at all.  I have hard backups and memory backups.  I'll be fine.  Rest of the world be damned.",

Love to see them perhaps weigh in on this though.\n\nAgain, I realize that they make 'tools' - still, I think many use their tools under the notion of:  not your keys, not your coins.

But crypto is more important than my phone number, so I made the effort and it wasn't difficult. Obviously have a physical back up too.

A Nano S is inexpensive (you can find them for $30-40 on ebay), and once you have checked that the device is genuine, it is safe to use it for recovery.\n\nAnd if you REALLY want to recover access without using another ledger, I would recommend using a phone wallet rather than a computer wallet, since they are considered safer (less malware on phones).",

Setting up a Ledger device with a MetaMask-generated recovery phrase will NOT make your accounts safer, as the recovery phrase has already been stored in hot storage. We advise setting up your Ledger device with its own 24 words recovery phrase and then transferring your assets to your Ledger accounts. Please unstake your assets before transferring. \n\nAfter you can access your Ledger account using Metamask and stake your assets, instructions are here: https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404366864657?docs=true\n\n> Also - can I use it with iPhone/bluetooth to sign and approve all my transactions or is it really meant to be used on a desktop/laptop?\n\nYou cannot use MetaMask with your Ledger device on Mobile at the moment. Don't hesitate to use Walletconnect instead to connect your Ledger accounts to Dapps supporting wallet connect on Mobile. Instructions in the article linked below: \nhttps://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018444599?docs=true\n\n> can anyone recommend a good resource (YouTube etc) that explains how it all works ELI5?\nYou can check out the Ledger Youtube channel for more information. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/Ledger",

The most used / supported seed phrase length are 12 and 24 words (both are supported by ledger). \n\nAlso, the BIP39 standard includes an optional user-defined arbitrary string called the BIP39 passphrase, that can be added to the BIP39 seed phrase to define the BIP39 seed. The ledger supports the BIP39 passphrase, sometimes incorrectly referred to as \"the 25th word\". Not all wallets support the BIP39 passphrase, unfortunately.",

The ownership is the wallet that they live in. So if they're in your wallet your wallet address owns those coins and then if you send them to someone else their wallet address now owns those coins but in order to make those transfers happen you need that phrase and when you have one of those phrases live on a device like a computer or a phone inside of a piece of software you have the potential for a virus to extract that data and send that phrase to the hacker or in some cases you can have software that captures your screen and when you first created the wallet and the seed words came up on the screen phone the software or the virus installed recognized those words is being a cryptocurrency wallet and send it to the hacker. Now the hacker is just waiting for you to put money into those wallets because he's got your seed phrase and he's got a bot set up to grab whatever gets transferred in when it happens.\n\nThat can't happen with the nano because the key never leaves the device when signing the transaction.\n\nThe only way your funds can disappear would be if someone were to find your 24-word phrase so I suggest adding a 25th seed phrase and treating your 24-word main wallet as a dummy wallet.\n\nFor example I have about $100 worth of Bitcoin sitting in my main 24-word wallet and then I have my seed phrase which is a 25th word or some type of phrase that you do not write down on paper, so you need to think of something that you can remember in your head and then your real wallet, the one with all the money becomes the 24 word seed phrase that you wrote down plus that 25th word that you know in your head. Unlike the first 24 words, you get to pick what the 25th word is. It can be a single word or it can be a sentence or it can be, well it can even contain characters. But it needs to be something that you can remember in your head that you will never forget.\n\nThen you can literally take your 24-word seed phrase and stick it on the refrigerator with a magnet and if somebody gets a hold of it I mean, I have like $100 in my main account in Bitcoin and that is it.\n\nIf all of the sudden it moves, I know someone got a hold of my 24 word phrase and my 25th word is something that's only special to me from when I was a child and the only other people that would know, my parents, they have both passed.",

The firmware of the devices is open-source, and beyond that, their hardware itself is open source, from the circuit board layout to the chips design.  \nThat should mean there's nothing secret about what the device does and how it works.  \nIf you're able to look at all the source documents and understand them, you can verify for yourself that nothing nefarious is happening there. And then if you're able to build a device yourself from those documents and files, you can have a truly trust-less device that you can be 100% confident has no backdoor.  \nThe trade-off is that there are known physical attacks that can [extract the keys from a Trezor device in 15 minutes](https://blog.kraken.com/post/3662/kraken-identifies-critical-flaw-in-trezor-hardware-wallets/), and no good way to prevent that from happening (Trezor recommends using a complex passphrase to encrypt those keys at rest to make it harder to decrypt the keys once they've been extracted from their device.)\n\nIn contrast, Ledger devices contain a \"Secure Element\", a battle-tested chip that Ledger licenses for its product, whose implementation details are proprietary, whose driver code is also proprietary and that Ledger is not authorized to open-source.  \nFor that trade-off, you gain some measure of hardware tampering resistance, as certified by various trusted entities.  \nThat secure chip is where keys are stored on your ledger, and there are no known method to extract keys from that chip.\n\nBecause of this, it made sense for me to pick a hardware wallet that perhaps wasn't going to give up its keys in a few minutes if a technically skilled adversary got their hands on it.  \n\nBut die-hard open-source aficionados could have different priorities, or decide that physical attacks are not a concern, or be willing to type a complex passphrase every time they need to use it.",

If something happens to the one, you've got a backup that's easy to use, then you can relax while the new replacement you bought yourself ships to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Could you walk me through how you would have both of the two ledgers set up? \n\nYou'd use the first one to generate your recovery phrase (aka seed phrase) and then make really sure that you write down that recovery phrase and make sure that it never. ever. ever ends up on a computer or in a photo...the recovery phrase should never touch the internet in any way. Then you store it. \n\nFor me I wrote the recovery phrase on the included piece of paper, and then made a backup on metal and burned the piece of paper. \n\nFor the second ledger you just set it up from the recovery phrase you just made.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>...would you just consider the lost one not to be an issue because after 3x unsuccessful pin code log in attempts it resets?\n\nThis is personal preference. Assuming you didn't do something kinda amateur-hour like set the PIN to your birthday, 1234, or something [like these](https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2012/sep/28/debit-cards-currentaccounts); then you should be fine. The odds of somebody randomly (within 3 guesses) guessing your PIN is something like 3 in 9999 odds, or a 0.03% chance. If you like those odds, great! Move along. If you don't, make a 6 or 8 number PIN and lower your odds to 3 in 999999 or 3 in 99999999. Or if even those odds are too high for you, then yes, you could setup a new hardware wallet with a new recovery phrase and spend the time/money/effort to transfer your funds and assets to the new account(s).\n\n\\-----\n\nLet me know if any of that was unclear, happy to help more.",

It is very important that you do not import your current Metamask seed phrase into your Ledger, as this will compromise the security of the account. It is essential that you create a new account using your Ledger.\n\nSo, first you will need to set up your Ledger (there are numerous guides or videos online to get you through this process), making sure to secure your new seed phrase.\n\nNext, head over to your Metamask, click on the circle in the top-right corner and select \"Connect Hardware Wallet.\" Simply follow the steps, and you're good to go. Note that at no point should you enter your new seed phrase from your Ledger. Those words should never be typed into your computer anywhere.\n\nThe final step is to send all your coins/tokens from your current Metamask wallet to the new one you created with your Ledger. This means you will pay gas fees, so try to time your transfers to when fees are a bit lower. Unfortunately, there is no way to completely avoid gas fees, but that's a small price to pay for the added security.\n\nGood luck!",

At that point their online since they\u2019ve come through the exchanges website, no? So when people buy Bitcoin do they have it online for a couple minutes until they can transfer their keys to Ledger?\n\nNo, your private leys never leave your ledger. Your ledger is able to sign your transactions without exposing your seed. The only thing that gets in-line on the computer are your public address and your signed transaction (which is eventually stored on the blockchain, once confirmed by the network. Neither of those put your assets at risks.\n\n\\> Couple years back I bought some Bitcoin only to make a small purchase online.\n\nHope the weed was good!\n\n  \n\\>  I had just a tiny bit of Change left but don\u2019t exactly remember how much. I saved a txt document with 2 keys in them. I didn\u2019t mark them as private/public/wallet or anything. Just two strings of characters. I want to see what the balance is, if any. How do I see if there\u2019s any Bitcoin left? Is there a way to determine which of the 2 keys I have is the private or public?\n\nAssuming you used legacy BTC addresses, Your public BTC address starts with 1, and your private key starts with K or L (keep this one private!).\n\nTo check your balance, enter your public address (starting with 1) on a BTC blockchain explorer, like [https://blockchair.com/fr/bitcoin](https://blockchair.com/fr/bitcoin) (doing this is safe).",

I use mainly Trezors but I have a few Ledger Nano S's that I use here and there too. When I went through the whole set up process for the new Nano X and generated the seed, there is a repeating word in there.\n\nYes having repeating words in your seed phrase is safe.\n\n>In all the wallets I have created, I have never seen this before, have any of you? Is it safe? Secondly, after connecting the Nano S to the computer after those have been in hibernation for a long while, I noticed that if you put BTC and ETH on there, that is basically all it can fit. It used to be able to fit about 4-5 different coins on there (including BTC and ETH), didn't it?\n\nThe apps get a little bit bigger when they are updated. The S can usually only hold about 3 apps at this point. You will just have to uninstall and reinstall different apps as you need to use them.",

We will gladly answer you!\n\nOur Ledger Hardware wallets are designed to choose your 24-word recovery phrase for you. These are generated randomly with a huge number of possibilities, making it virtually impossible for any two people to have the same recovery phrase. \n\nOur True Random Number Generator has the highest certificates possible when it comes down to the quality of randomness - you can read more about this here:\nhttps://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010073520-Quality-of-randomness\n\nIt is totally possible that you might receive the same words in your 24 word combination.\n\nHowever, we highly suggest that you give it your time (30 minutes recommended) to go through your words slowly while writing them and placing them in their correct positions to avoid any mistakes.\n\n- Please keep your 24 words out of any online activity\n- Never share them with anyone but yourself\n- Ledger will never ask you for your recovery phrase\n- Keep it in a safe place and away from any possible damage.\n- You can learn more about it here: https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-is-a-recovery-phrase\n\nShould you prefer, you can use an additional 25th word of your own choosing on top of your recovery phrase. This is known as the passphrase, which is an advanced security feature. You can read more about it here:\nhttps://www.ledger.com/academy/passphrase-an-advanced-security-feature\n\nWe hope this helps. Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any further questions. \n\nKind Regards,",

I hold NFTs on Solana, Harmony, Ethereum, Polygon, and probably a couple more chains using an account backed up on my Nano S.  The \"compatibility\" here specifically refers to Ledger Live.\n\nThe NFT features in Ledger Live allow you to send NFTs using what we call \"clear signing\" which is where it shows you precisely the collection name that you're transferring on the Nano's screen while you're accepting that transaction.  The NFT clear-signing features in Ledger Live don't work on the Nano S, due to its limited capacity to be able to store all of those NFT collections' info.  The S Plus supports clear signing just fine, just like the X.\n\nWhen you connect your Ledger to Metamask, you can use your Ledger account to do *literally anything* Metamask can do.  Connect your Nano S to metamask using the \"connect hardware wallet\" option in the menu, switch Metamask over to the BSC network, and use your favorite NFT marketplace on BSC to buy, sell, or manage your NFTs with your Ledger accounts.\n\nI do have videos on Metamask setup ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y51\\_Baq1\\_nc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y51_Baq1_nc)) as well as understanding how to use other networks like Polygon and BSC ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMBQ3BpTBeQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMBQ3BpTBeQ)).  Hopefully those 2 videos together can show you how powerful Ledger + Metamask actually is.",

In order to clear sign for NFTs, the device has to be aware of which smart contract addresses map to which collection.  So like, the fact that `0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d` is the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT.  This additional information makes the Ethereum app quite a bit larger, and the S is very limited as far as storage capacity.\n\nThe S Plus and X have the same amount of capacity, and it's *more than enough* for those devices to not get outdated anytime soon.  Honestly the fact that the S is still as capable as it is goes to show how future-proof these new devices will be.  The S is *fully* capable of doing the basics, and with Metamask there are no limitations.  As more and more contract data gets pushed to the nano though to enable safe clear-signing, I can imagine the S may start to show its age more and more.  Even then, the way we're doing most of that though the Discover apps means the S will probably continue to stay equally as safe and as capable as the rest. \n\nHowever, If you're debating now between the S and the S Plus, definitely go with the Plus",

Seed phrase is essentially just a password that you use to \"prove\" to the Blockchain that you are the true owner of the address that has XX coins in it. Once you prove that, it lets you do whatever you want with the coins.\n\nIf your seed phrase is or was ever on any device connected to the internet (like metamask) it is possible that it was or could be seen by a hacker. Ledger generates that seed offline and as long as you don't input that seed on a online device anywhere, it is more secure.  That is the security you are buying with a ledger. If the transaction fees aren't worth the extra security to you then you don't need a ledger.\n\nSetting up the Ledger generated seed phrase will give you another address on the Blockchain that now has a more secure password.  Once you do that just send the coins to the new wallet.",
