I get it, but it\u2019s a bit strong.\n\nYes, a seed phrase that has never been on a computer or smartphone has a far smaller likelihood of potential theft than a phrase that has been. Malware is a thing. So is being sloppy (having photos of the phrase in iCloud, or a text file synced to cloud storage, or whatever).\n\nHowever, a phrase that has been on a computer at some point is not guaranteed to have been compromised. Most have not been, and will never be.\n\nLet\u2019s say, you buy a coin or token on your computer, using Metamask on your PC, and it blows up in value (not a problem the past few weeks lol). You decide it\u2019s high time for a hardware wallet because you want to keep it safer, because it\u2019s actually worth something now, and you\u2019re a HODLer.\n\nBut, alas, gas fees / tokenomics / what have you are costly, to simply move your coins/tokens to a new wallet address.\n\nSo, now you do a quick risk/likelihood calculation: is the potential Risk of having had a seed phrase on a computer for a little bit of time greater than the potential loss via gas fees or what have you?\n\nRisk = Impact x Likelihood\n\nIf you think that the Likelihood that your personal computer has been at all compromised in the past 7 days or whatever is relatively low, it might be an ok move to switch the very same phrase to a hardware wallet, and wipe the phrase off the computer. It\u2019s not necessarily \u201cworthless\u201d to do so per se. Especially if you\u2019ve been careful, never visit shady sites or porn or whatever on that machine, and/or run a secure OS, and all that. It\u2019s like unprotected sex - you\u2019ll *probably* be ok and not get herpes. How careful are you? How well do you know her? Was this one-time, or a 2-month daily rabbit fest?\n\nOP will probably be ok, and moving a seed phrase from a computer to a hardware wallet, and then wiping the phrase from the computer, is statistically much safer than never using a hardware wallet at all. OP just reduced their risk surface exposure by doing this. Just not to 0, is all. Yes, 0 is best, and if OP can generate a new phrase on the hardware device, and then transfer their tokens from Metamask on their PC to it, that is optimal, you are correct.\n\nThere are gradients of Risk, is what I\u2019m saying. OP is probably fine. But, eyes open.",

                    "response": "The whole point of a Ledger is to only ever type the seed phrase in on the secure Ledger device which contains a hardware security module to protect your key and never touches the internet.\n\nMetamask is a hot wallet which is internet connected, if you use that seed on the Ledger you\u2019ve not got ANY additional protection by using a Ledger.\n\nTo remedy your issue leave the seed phrase in Metamask, reset the Ledger and generate a new seed phrase using the Ledger - do not take a photo of this phrase, do not store this phrase on a computer, do not put this phrase into Metamask, write it on paper and put it in a safe (or even better buy a steel wallet).\n\nThen send all crypto from Metamask to your newly generated Ethereum/ERC address on the ledger. Your Ethereum/ERC tokens are now secure.\n\nNow each blockchain has different methods of accessing it, Metamask is for Ethereum and Ethereum tokens (known as ERC-20) and a few other cryptocurrencies outside the scope of this post (Cronos/polygon/BSC) but does not cater for Bitcoin. You\u2019ll need to download a Bitcoin wallet such as electrum and set that wallet up with your old Metamask seed phrase in order to access your Bitcoin and to send this to a new Bitcoin address on your Ledger in order to protect your Bitcoin properly.\n\nHope this helps\n\nEDIT: to answer your further question re: seed phrases and Bitcoin:\n\nYou\u2019re correct, Bitcoin cannot be stored on Metamask BUT a seed phrase can be used to generate an address on nearly every chain because they are chain agnostic. Therefore whilst your Bitcoin can be stored on your \u201cMetamask seed phrase\u201d it can\u2019t be accessed via Metamask and you would need to access it as I outlined above.",

The seed determines all addresses that can be made (deterministic wallet) . So it doesn't matter if you add an account in Ledger live or not, they are already there - used or not. By adding account in Ledger live you are only telling the wallet which addresses you want to use out of dozens available.

Custodial means you leave your coins on an exchange. This has its pros and cons but this is another topic. Custodial eallets are hot and cold wallets. Hot wallets are those where your recovery seed is generated and then stored on a device which is connected to the internet. Cold wallet is one where the recovery seed is generated and stored offline (nowadays mostly on a device like ledger). This means that cold wallets are much safer but using them requires a bit more a time.\n\nSo after this your questions\n\n1 - what you mean here is that nobody will have access to your private keys, because they are stored offline. \n\n2 - never do this. You will make a hot wallet from your cold wallet this way. You should only enter your seed in another hardware device. Both wallets (metamask and terra) have options to sync them with your ledger.\n\n3 - you can check your funds in ledger live without connecting the device to your computer.\n\n4 - unfortunately ledger nano s has limited memory so you basically always have to delete/install apps. You can only use apps that are installed currently but that doesnt mean for example you lose your btc if you delete btc app. This only means that you cant send btc as long as the btc app is not installed again.",

                    "response": "These are all great questions, and some good answers in the thread already.  I'll take a shot at them too.\n\n\\`1. The Ledger gives you a mechanism to generate a seed phrase offline, off a computer, and allows you to *keep it that way* forever.  As long as you keep up your end of the deal, your seed phrase will stay safe.  You're right that attackers could still ask you for your seed phrase (and they will!), but they'll never get it from you unless you intentionally give it to them.  Obviously you won't do that. \n\nYou also can use your Ledger to sign transactions with malicious scam applications.  These scam applications will try to trick you into signing away your valuables to them while you're not paying attention.  Even if fall for one of these tricks, the signature itself occurs safely and securely, and in no way exposes your seed phrase to anyone.   A single scam transaction can't wipe out your entire account either.  It can take something valuable from you though which can be still cause pain.\n\nLedger tries to protect you from this by putting as many safe-signing features as possible into Ledger Live.  The NFT features, for example, let you transfer NFTs in a way that very clearly shows you on your Ledger's screen what's going on every step of the way.  Lots more features to come, but for now being careful with what you're signing is good practice.\n\n2. Ledger seed phrases follow a standard called BIP39, which is the same standard used by every hardware and software wallet provider.  This means that your seed phrase is ultimately portable, and you could take your ledger-generated seed phrase and import it into Metamask, or import it into a competing hardware wallet, no problem.  Your seed phrase is all you need to transact your assets on the blockchain, which means if it falls into the wrong hands, or gets exposed to a computer with malware, you're flirting with disaster.  I would never recommend you put your seed phrase into a computer for any reason ever.  To answer your question directly though, it is possible.\n\n3. Absolutely.   Zerion and Rainbow are both mobile apps that let you \"watch\" wallet addresses without needing your Ledger around.  You can't transact with watched addresses, but it does a great job at monitoring them.  Zerion can be set up to push-notify you anytime anything happens with the wallet address that you're watching which is really handy for monitoring for anything funky going on (or if you're someone who gets gifted assets pretty often!).  Rainbow is really great a showcasing your NFT collection on the go.  [Zapper.fi](https://Zapper.fi) is also a great website that lets you track your portfolio if you do a lot of DeFi.  Plenty of applications to choose from, and they're all totally fine watching Ledger-based accounts, no problem!\n\n4. The Ledger \"apps\" are often misunderstood, and frankly not well explained by our current literature.  The way to think of the apps as simply teaching your device how to talk to a given blockchain.  The Terra app teaches it how to talk to Terra, the Ethereum app teaches it how to talk to Ethereum.  You can add and remove them at will, and your accounts will always be there waiting for you when you reinstall the app later.  This is because your accounts are tied to your seed phrase, which remains on the device no matter which apps are installed at any given moment.  Feel free to swap apps out whenever/wherever you'd like :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but some great questions and I wanted to get you some good answers!",

                    "response": "It is possible to recover at least Bitcoin and Ethereum relatively easily.\n\nFor Bitcoin:\n\nAll BTC accounts created with ledger devices with Bitcoin app version 1.0.2 and later can be recovered using Electrum, connected to the ledger device.\n\nOn win 10/11, you may have to run Electrum in admin mode (right-click the Electrum icon, then select Run as administrator). Also make sure to close Ledger Live.\n\nMake sure your ledger device is connected, unlocked, and in the Bitcoin app (make sure that \"Browser Support is OFF in the Bitcoin app settings). In Electrum, follow: new account > standard account > use hardware device > select your ledger > select \"legacy\", then Next.\n\nThis will go to legacy account #0, i.e. derivation path m/44'/0'/0'\n\nIf your account is segwit (addresses start with \"3\") or native segwit type (addresses start with \"bc1q\"), select \"p2sh-segwit\" or \"native segwit\" instead of \"legacy\".\n\nIf you have multiple BTC legacy accounts (or if your account is not account #0), you can reach your other accounts by changing the derivation path to m/44'/0'/n' (where n is the account number). E.g. to reach account #1, use m/44'/0'/1' . The account number is the 3rd number in the derivation path (this is also true with p2sh-segwit and native segwit accounts).\n\n\\-----\n\nFor Ethereum and ERC20 tokens, recovery can be done using custom low-level tools, read:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/kz2eob/successful\\_recovery\\_story\\_how\\_we\\_recovered\\_100/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/kz2eob/successful_recovery_story_how_we_recovered_100/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/nbcukn/nano\\_s\\_with\\_12\\_firmware\\_vs\\_eip155\\_successful/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/nbcukn/nano_s_with_12_firmware_vs_eip155_successful/)\n\n\\-----\n\nFor Litecoin and Ripple, recovery is likely possible but would require even more efforts, so it depends how much you have on your accounts, as it may not be worth the recovery efforts.\n\nFido U2F is an app unrelated with crypto (it's for signing in securely on some systems, like yubikey), so you can ignore it.",

I.e. if you sign a transaction giving unlimited spend permissions for USDT, the malicious contract can never take your ETH.\n\nPhishing attempts which successfully get your recovery words/private key CAN drain all other accounts using the same private key/recovery words even if they have different derivation paths \n\n\nTLDR: No only the one is compromised",

As the private keys prove that you're the owner of the coins, that's all that's needed to access your coins. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe apps allow you to interact with these private keys. When you install the Ethereum app for example, you can interact with all your Ethereum accounts and the addresses tied to these accounts. An app itself does not store your coinsl; the apps check your private keys and know which addresses are yours, and allow you to send and receive coins. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen you need to interact with a cryptocoin (either on Ledger Live or another wallet client like MetaMask), you can install the app and make your transactions. So, you can install the Ethereum app, do your thing, and then if needed delete it. By deleting the app, you do not delete any of your coins, you only delete the app that makes it possible to interact with the coins. Your coins are tied to the private keys, and those stay 'stored' on the Ledger even after you delete an app.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, if you need to install an app, but you don't have the required space on your Ledger device, just make space available by deleting on or more of the installed apps. And then install the app that you need.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you notice that you need many apps installed at a time, you can upgrade to the Nano X; that one can handle many more apps at once. You can also wait for the Nano S Plus, which is not yet available. The Nano S is the improved version of  the regular S that has more space available for the apps.",

But each cryptocurrency uses a different \"derivation path\", which just means they start with the same SEED but make some different choices in how to generate the private keys and addresses under that seed. You usually won't have to think about his and can just use the same SEED for all of your crypto.\n\nOnce in a while you may find an unusual cryptocurrency that doesn't use the same standards or even more confusing a wallet that doesn't use the same derivation path as most wallets. In that case you could restore your seed to a different wallet and have a bit of a panic when you don't see you coins. But they are still there, you would just have to manually look up and enter the \"derivation path\" that the original wallet used.\n\nIf the coin and wallet state they use the standards you should be fine. The standard generally referred to as \"HD-Wallets\" is also known as BIP-32, BIP-39 and BIP-44. If your wallet and coin use those they should be compatible.\n\nAnd certainly if you are sticking to one wallet or device you shouldn't have any problem using ONE seed for all of your coins, even if you replace that wallet or device with another from the same vendor.",

Re-using passwords.  \nOf course entering the seed for a hardware wallet in any digital form is a very bad idea, but that generally has to be combined with at least one more bad practice to result in a loss, and password re-use is a big one, so i try to mention it whenever an opportunity arises.  \n  \nOP might have what he calls \"my password\", and uses that one password for everything. It's absolutely shocking how many people use a password for more than one site. It was a terrible idea even in the 90's, and it's just plain stupid now.  \n  \nSo maybe he used his one and only password to setup his icloud account, and his google account, and his ebay account, and his paypal account, and his bank account, and his teamviewer account, and literally everything else.  \n  \nThen one of those sites (that has bad security practices) gets their database stolen, and some hacker runs a script that uses the credentials in that database to try to log in to whatever he thinks is the most common site that everyone uses. Then he finds one that works, so he starts using that set of credentials to log into every popular site, and a lot of them work. At that point it's just a guessing game to find out what sites OP uses, and when he finds one, he's pretty much guaranteed to get in. But no doubt some of the first sites he tries will be google, apple, paypal, and teamviewer. He gets into google and apple, starts looking through photos, and finds the pic of OP's seed phrase (which OP is probably not being truthful about), and steals his crypto. Then he goes to paypal and steals cash. Then he tries teamviewer for the possible big score of literally everything OP has.  \n  \nIt wouldn't be at all surprising if OP starts discovering a lot of other accounts have been compromised.  \n  \nPeople, don't re-use passwords. Seriously bad idea that will almost certainly result in some sort of loss at some point.",

It also means that someone else might have gotten a copy of the paper and used it. I mean, people forget what they did. Could it be that you gave a copy to a friend to save? or it might have been seen by your parents who took a screenshot? Could it be that your house was bugged?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean, it's a shame, it is a big loss of funds.

Your tax basis resets to the value on the date of death, so if your beneficiaries later sell the inherited crypto, they will be able to avoid a bunch of taxes if your crypto had appreciated since you purchased it. They'll only owe taxes on the increase from the value when you died.",

If you still want to keep the details of your crypto assets secret, it's better to setup a revocable trust now and put the crypto in there. You then list the beneficiaries inside the trust document. The advantage is that trusts are not required to be made public, so 3rd parties won't have any information about your assets even after you die, and your beneficiaries can inherit without everyone else knowing how much they received. \n\nTalk to an estate & trusts lawyer about setting this up, it should be relatively inexpensive.\n\nYou also want to create a well-written guide for your beneficiaries on how they will actually access your crypto. And maybe run through some drills with them so they will have some idea on what they should do in the event of your death.",

For maximum security I would move the coins once you restore the account to a new set of ledger generated seeds / new accounts. You can do this with the same ledger by using the passcode feature and adding a 25th word. This will generate all new keys and you will basically have two ledgers in one.
