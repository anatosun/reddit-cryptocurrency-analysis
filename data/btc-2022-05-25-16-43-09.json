Reward is dominated by the coinbase transaction and this halves every 4 years.  Early on, miner revenue growth was dominated by price appreciation.  Eventually when price growth fails to keep up with at least doubling to counteract the coinbase decay, total revenue available to miners will peak and then the halvings will become the dominant factor driving endless revenue decay.  There may be a basis for peak bitcoin to correspond to peak miner revenue.  This is because investments into mining ultimately translate into demand for bitcoin as miners seek to acquire bitcoin so they can repay their capex expenditures.  You can buy bitcoin directly or you can buy a mining rig.  Both investments paths create demand.  But once this industry peaks, it will become harder to source new investment.  Then as revenue enters demonstrable decline, new investment will become even more scarce.  Ironically this is the consequence of the disinflationary nature of the token.  New issuance slows and slows until zero.  On one hand the 21M cap is an attractive quality for token holders, on the other hand it is an unattractive quality for miners because it means their pay must be cut over time.    \n\n\nAnyways, this is my theory on why the log trend is rolling over and why it is happening now.  We appear to be close to the inflection point where price appreciation hands the torch to coinbase decay as the driving factor for revenue available to the mining industry.  The 2024 halving event will be pivotal unless price somehow jumps quite a bit to fight it.",

It shows doublings not linear movement.\n\nHere's how it works.\n\nIf BTC is worth $1 and goes up $1 then you doubled your money.\n\nIf BTC is worth $20,000 and goes up $1 you didn't make anything. To get the same return, you'd need BTC to hit $40,000.\n\nOn a linear chart the change from $1 to $2 is represented exactly the same as the change from $20,000 to $20,001. On a logarithmic chart the change from $1 to $2 is represented using the same scale as the change from $20,000 to $40,000.\n\nA linear chart that goes up at 45\u00b0 is misleading because it looks like linear returns but in reality these are diminishing returns. A logarithmic scale corrects that error.",

                    "response": "**Full news:**   \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, such activities are common on most major exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, and FTX. Usually, the token goes up in value after being listed on a major exchange. So, in August, one wallet accumulated $360,000 worth of Gnosis coins in six days. On the seventh day, Binance announced the listing of Gnosis on its platform, driving the token price up more than 7 times. The wallet started selling tokens four minutes after Binance announced the listing and got rid of all tokens within 24 hours. By doing so, the investor earned $500,000, making a profit of about $140,000. Analysis reveals that it wasn't the first time this wallet bought up tokens before listing on a major exchange and then sold them.\r  \n\r  \nArgus found that 46 wallets purchased $17.3 million worth of cryptocurrency shortly before the tokens appeared on the three major exchanges. However, the identity of the owners remains unknown. The detected profit from token sales was more than $1.7 million, but the actual profit is probably even higher. \r  \n\r  \nRegulators say such activity causes negative consequences for retail investors, but so far, there is nothing they can do to eliminate such practices.\r  \n\r  \nThe exchanges mentioned in the analysis deny their employees use insider information to trade. They pointed out that their policies prohibit employees from purchasing tokens in case they possess confidential information.",
