Act like you\u2019re the best victim they could imagine, so they don\u2019t drop you and try to scam you while you waste their time. Time is the most important for scammers, they don\u2019t care if you instantly call them out, because then they know that you won\u2019t fall for it so they can move on to find another victim. But if you waste their time, you\u2019re probably saving someone from getting scammed.",
