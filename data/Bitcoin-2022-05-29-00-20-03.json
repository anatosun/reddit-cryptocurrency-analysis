I enjoyed mining so much that I have invested into an immersion cooling setup and will continue to gradually build a room filled with immersed S19s. \n\nNo noise, a single fan with hot air blown to the outside. Immersion cooling is definitely worth the time, effort, and money. It made relatively large-scale home mining feasible.",

I would be looking into the s19 95th or better. Maybe a s19j pro 100th...i could only afford 1 to start with, but is that profitable? Not looking to get rich immediately, but from my research, i found to be able to profit $4 to $7 AFTER power costs per day. Which isnt bad to me. And that's at todays market prices! Any input?",

Running it non-stop for a year will yield 0.156 after electricity costs (\\~0.05$).\n\nMining purely for fiat profits is not a good reason to get in. I'd only encourage mining if one won't liquidate the minted bitcoin and believes bitcoin will keep rising in price. That 0.156 is probably going to be worth triple the purchase price of an S19 after the halving (assuming we break into six figures).",

Demand ultimately sets the price.\n\nMy recommendations for anyone new.  \n\n1- make 100% sure you know your power rate.   Some residential rates bump up with usage and I know lots of people who lost money mining and ended up selling their units at a loss due to them not knowing their rate at higher usage.\n\n2- buy a cheap miner like an S9.  Make sure you can deal with the noise and heat before upgrading.  You will lose money at your power rate but better than spending a ton more on an S19 and then finding out the noise is too much.\n\n3.  Run calculations with different assumptions.  Make sure you will be profitable at $20000 per coin in case we go that direction.  Run an assumption of 5-6% per month difficulty increase as your BTC mined will be going down.  Just the publicly traded companies announced purchases will take us to over 320 eh I believe.  Who knows how fast they can deploy though. https://insights.braiins.com/en/profitability-calculator/ After your have run some different scenarios, calculate how much Bitcoin you could buy for the cost of a miner and other expenses, add in a dca each month for what you would be spending on electric.  \n\nUltimately just do lots of research before jumping in.  Too many people end up not doing enough and then losing money.  \n\nGood luck!",

A 40L Bitcool bucket or another ASIC-based fluid would cost me $3,000 plus shipping, not to mention that liquid imports are not allowed where I'm from.\n\nI ended up using a premium transformer oil called Shell Diala. 209L drum for $500. Some miners claim to have used it for 2 years without issues, while others who claim to be experts in the transformer industry say such fluid will eventually have a compatibility issue with the rubbers holding the capacitors in hashboards. \n\nEither way, I'm eventually going to use Bitcool when I'm %110 sure that my system is leakproof. \n\nIf you're doing it for fun, just go with basic food-based mineral oil, with a fish tank, water fountain pump, and a couple of  400mm PC radiators. If you're not into DIY, order an all-in ready-to-use FogHash [C1 immersion setup.](https://www.foghashing.io/c1) It can handle a single S19 and it's cheap ($1,500)",
