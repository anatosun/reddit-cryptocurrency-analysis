            "selftext": "I post that for fun don\u2019t take it seriously but I wanted to hear your thoughts about it. Do your own research\n\nHere is my prediction :\n\n2024 : 91,959 $\n\n2025 : 116,558 $\n\n2026 : 151,526 $\n\n2027 : 195,033 $\n\n2028 : 252,294 $\n\n2029 : 326,375 $\n\n2030 : 467,862 $\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My thought process :**\n\nVelocity of USD (M1V) = GDP / M1 = 4,5 on average in the past\n\nThere is no GDP metric of purchases of goods & services in exchange for gold or in exchange for bitcoin but since most of the transactions involving gold or bitcoin are currently financial we can take trading volume as an alternative to GDP.\n\n\u201cVelocity of Gold\u201d = Yearly Gold Trading Volume in $ / Gold Market Cap = 4,5 on average\n\nNow why shall Bitcoin have a different velocity than gold and dollar on average ? They all aim to be money, are or have been.\n\nNow the issue is that wash trading can falsify the real trading volume (if I buy bitcoin and sell it just after a million times it can be disregarded in the trading volume). So we can\u2019t trust the trading volume bindly.\n\nNow if we use the 2017 CoinMarketCap trading volume, the ratio 4,5 and the bitcoin supply at that time of 16 millions aproximately we can calculate the presupposed price of bitcoin by solving this equation :\n\n\u201cVelocity of Bitcoin\u201d = Yearly Bitcoin Trading Volume in $ / Bitcoin Market Cap\n\n4,5 = 1,285,994,278,980 $ / 16,000,000 \\* Price\n\n4,5 \\* (16,000,000 \\* Price) = (1,285,994,278,980 $ / 16,000,000 \\* Price) \\* (16,000,000 \\* Price)\n\n72,000,000 \\* Price = 1,285,994,278,980 $\n\nPrice = 17,861.0316525 $\n\nIt is almost the 2017 All Time High so we can assume the 2017 Bitcoin Trading Volume was correct and had no suffered too much wash trading, we can use it as a base.\n\nIf we assume Bitcoin user growth to be aproximately 30% a year based on the increase of active addresses each year we can take the 2017 volume and increase it by 30% each year to guess the future volume without wash trading.\n\nFor 2018 it gives us a volume of 1,671,792,562,674$\n\nFor 2019 : 2,173,330,331,476.2$\n\nFor 2020 : 2,825,329,430,919.06$\n\nFor 2021 : 3,672,928,260,194.778$\n\nFor 2022 : 30% more. For 2023 30% more etc...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now we can try to guess the future bitcoin price :\n\n2018 : Yearly Bitcoin Trading Volume in $ / 4,5 / Bitcoin Supply\n\n= 1,671,792,562,674$ / 4,5 / 16,800,000 = 22,114 $ | Actual 2018 ATH : 17,234 $\n\n2019 : 2,173,330,331,476.2$ / 4,5 / 17,500,000 = 27,598 $ | Actual 2019 ATH : 13,880 $\n\n2020 : 2,825,329,430,919.06$ / 4,5 / 18,000,000 = 34,881 $ | Actual 2020 ATH : 29,300 $\n\n2021 : 3,672,928,260,194.778$ / 4,5 / 18,500,000 = 44,119 $ | Actual 2021 ATH : 69,000 $\n\n2022 : 4,774,806,738,253 $ / 4,5 / 19,000,000 = 55,846 $ | Current 2022 ATH : 48,000 $\n\n2023 : 6207,248,759,728.9 $ / 4,5 / 19,000,000 = 72,599 $\n\n2024 : 8,069,423,387,648 $ / 4,5 / 19,500,000 = 91,959 $\n\n2025 : 10,490,250,403,942 $ / 4,5 / 20,000,000 = 116,558 $\n\n2026 : 13,637,325,525,125 $ / 4,5 / 20,000,000 = 151,526 $\n\n2027 : 17,728,523,182,663 $ / 4,5 / 20,200,000 = 195,033 $\n\n2028 : 23,047,080,137,461 $ / 4,5 / 20,300,000 = 252,294 $\n\n2029 : 29,961,204,178,700 $ / 4,5 / 20,400,000 = 326,375 $\n\n2030 : 38,949,565,432,310 $ / 4,5 / 20,500,000 = 467,862 $",

I got to learn recently why POW is better than POS and this Twitter thread explains it so well. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/namcios/status/1529527133898432513?t=NVn0lXlRXpbh2IAqvuydcg&s=19\n\nEdit: wanted to add this to the criticism that miner control everything about BTC:\nNo no and big no. \n\nI don't know why this lie got out like this. \n\nNode is the basically the backbone of the rules through which bitcoin is running. \n\nIt is so much misunderstood  that Bitcoin is running because of miners but no, it is running because of nodes that support the protocol and safeguards it's governance and rules.\n\nIf there are very less miners in the world and we keep the nodes exactly the same. Bitcoin will still run exactly the same just the network difficulty will decrease for that small group of miner getting the btc rewards and fees. \n\nBut this can't be said vice versa. Example BCH and BSV, they all died because they require heavy nodes. \n\nRead about blocksize wars and you will get it.\n\nEdit 2: Another criticism:\nIf I control 51% hashrate, I can create a fraudulent block and become rich (obviously paraphrasing from comments)\n\nIf you control 51% of the hashrate and put any transactions ( may be made up or fraudulent) other than mempool transactions in each and every node out there. When you will broadcast that block as mined, all the nodes will reject that block and won't add it to the chain of events aka blockchain. \n\nOnly your nodes will accept it and you branch off the main chain and there goes your 51% hashrate. Enjoy a branched off blockchain version which no other nodes identify as the real truth aka bitcoin.\n\nEdit 3: adding a comment that resonated with me a lot from the thread below:\n\"Absolutely. And it\u2019s pretty ingenious in hindsight. Not sure if it\u2019s all planned according to Satoshi\u2019s infinite wisdom or if a bit of luck was involved. \n\nSurely the bitcoiner at the time didn\u2019t understand it well, not until the history panned out.\n\nOur tiny little $100 raspberry pi turn out to be the masters of everything, and all the super high powered X kW set up turns out to be just our security guards. \n\nThe people hold the power and the \u201cpowers\u201d bow down to the people. It\u2019s just beautiful. But also frustrating that people don\u2019t understand the implications of it. It\u2019s so often misunderstood, you\u2019re right everyone should read The Blocksize War.\"- u/savinelli_smoker",

While yes every miner is a full node, a full node is not always a miner.\n\nFor example, I'm running 2 nodes, not mining any BTC, but my nodes are what verifies the transactions and secures the ledger.\n\nWhile it may appear that only a couple companies are running miners, you can't discredit the several 10s of thousands of individuals running their own full node. Or the individual miners that don't publicly announce that they are mining.\n\nEvery full node gets a \"vote\" in any changes to bitcoin, and bitcoin being the upmost decentralized thing out there aside from nature or the night sky, you're pretty safe from any potential 51% attack.",

It is also the only link between a string of numbers and the \u201creal world\u201d, without which the number is just an \u201cout of thin air\u201d number, no different from the fiats that the whole world is printing by the trillions. PoW is the real innovation. Whereas PoS is just the current system we have. \n\nYou may want to look up how much energy is wasted every year around the world (or even just the US alone), how much stranded energy that cannot be transmitted anywhere. Just a fraction of that wasted energy is enough to run the entire bitcoin network. By its nature, Bitcoin is uniquely capable of making use of this stranded energy, because 1) they are the cheapest so the miners have the incentive to seek them out; 2) bitcoin miner can go to the energy, no matter how remote, while the energy cannot be transmitted to human population. 3) much of the cheapest energy are the hydro electric type, it\u2019s just a waterfall or some river stream that the miners can take advantage of.  No carbon footprint.\n\nWithout those miners, the whole world will just watch this energy flared away or go wasted. Bitcoin right now, today, is helping energy companies to build renewable energy sources by subsidising solar and wind in locations where it was uneconomical to build previously. Bitcoin also helps strengthen the electric grid by allowing energy companies to \u201cbuild for the peak\u201d. How it works is the companies, with bitcoin mining as subsidy, can build more capacity to accommodate the unexpected peaks of consumptions (heat wave or cold storm), bitcoin miners can be switched off completely within seconds to give the extra capacity to the city when needed. And during normal times it can generate an income without which this a extra capacity will not be built. And without this extra capacity the city would simple experience blackouts. \n\nThe headline of bitcoin consuming energy equivalent to a small country is concerning, of course. And it certainly gets a lot of attention. But everything is in perspective, if we look at it from another angle, the total bitcoin energy consumption is less than the energy we use on dryers, or video gaming. \n\nUltimately I think a lot of it comes to whether you think it\u2019s \u201cworth it\u201d, to you perhaps it\u2019d be a waste if even one kW is used on it, but worth is subjective. If you asked me I\u2019d not hesitate to say say video gaming is so much more of a waste in comparison. But who are we to judge? If we believe in the free markets then whether something is worth the price is indicated by whether someone is willing to pay for it. To the gamers around the world the electricity bill is well worth the entertainment value, and pay for the electricity. In that case there is no need to argue further on subjective \u201cworth\u201d. The action speaks for itself. \n\nThis is a rather deep topic and many people have spent years learning and studying it, there is a lot of info online, Nic Carter is an expert on this topic please feel free to look him up if you are interested. It really isn\u2019t what it appears to be, only if you dig a bit deeper. \n\n[sorry for the long post]",

The reason this hasn't (successfully) happened yet is because the incentives on which Bitcoin is build, **actually** **work**. If it was more profitable to attack the network than to defend it, the project would've failed years ago.\n\n>Block producers (people with lots of money) have a lot of power on both PoW and PoS\n\nBitcoin has the miners, the validators and the Bitcoin holders.\n\nPoS combines all 3 into 1.\n\nBtw, I'd argue that block producers do not have much power at all in a PoW system. If this were the case, the block size war would've been won by the miners back in 2017. 2017 showed us that miners are nothing more than voluntary worker bees for the blockchain.

If you were running a new node with the bugged code you would have joined the now orphaned bugged chain because it actually had 60% of the hashpower.\n\nSocial consensus is what's keeping this from being an issue: why did that network split?

You're already getting less return than an honest miner because you get no transaction fees, so your margins are tighter. \n\nAt the next difficulty adjustment, if the difficulty goes up, it's a certainty that you will be in the group of miners who are no longer profitable (because you are receiving no fees). You have to choose: either begin including transactions, stop your attack, or operate at a loss (how long can you keep that up for?).\n\nIf the difficulty goes down, more miners will be able to start mining profitably again. I'd assume you would have no idle mining rigs because if your goal is to gain 51% of the hashrate you would switch all your miners on, even if some of them aren't individually profitable. So in the event of a difficulty adjustment you will become a smaller proportion of the hashrate when new miners join, likely falling below 51%.\n\nIt's really not possible to sustain an empty-block 51% attack for long. This is the key difference between PoW and PoS, in PoS there's no ongoing cost to being a \"miner\", so once you're in the lead position you can stay there. In PoW you have the ongoing expenditure of energy and the requirement to keep your hardware up to date, which combined with the difficulty adjustment makes it very difficult to sustain the attack for long.",

You have the choice to do that in banks, stocks, gold, Bitcoin, real estate, or a box of cash under your bed. Each one of those ways, even the box of cash, produces a ton of emissions. Bitcoin is most directly competing with banks because it it is most fungible in comparison to things like real estate which are absolutely non-fungible.\n\nThis is a competition. There's nothing wrong with that. If we fast forward 100 years there is the potential that Bitcoin and banks are competing even more closely. And by then mining will be gone and the energy argument will be finished.\n\nYou know what though, while banks have put forth zero effort to maintain greener options, Bitcoin has grown greener every year. That's worth something. Taking possession over your own wealth is worth something. The advancement of technology that shows us what out there is obsolete is worth something.\n\nThe arguments don't hold weight. There are far better arguments against Bitcoin than the energy argument, and even those are pretty pathetic. For anyone outside of those who have something to gain from the current form of financials, Bitcoin looks attractive. There is a reason that the people who are most against it either already have billions of dollars, or are part of governments.",

And because there is often a main figure or company behind PoS systems, it's much easier to corrupt/coerce etc. PoS will work great 99.9% of the time, but it is much more likely to go off the rails in case of some sort of Black Swan event. \n\nIt's ab-so-fucken-lutely not something you would want at the base layer of the world economy. Unless, of course, you are one of the few with power over said system.",

It\u2019s an immutable ledger entry that can never be altered.\n\n3. That\u2019s the best accounting technology that\u2019s ever been created by humans.\u201d\n\n4. 4/ \u201cSo anything that lives on top of this #Bitcoin network will be better than the legacy system that it replaces.\n\n5. And it is only because of PoW that you\u2019re able to have this immutable ledger and all the other layers for financial and economical freedom.\u201d\n\n2 appears to be a false statement insofar as it can be altered if enough hash power is obtained, right?\n\n3 appears to be an opinion, not a statement has been shown to be true.\n\n4 is a false premise. It does not follow that something built on tech with more features will be better. One could have a poor designer, for example; or a feature could have unintended adverse consequences.\n\n5 is either an uncertain premise or a circular fallacy, depending on how you interpret it.\n\nTwitter is not a suitable medium for explanation or discussion, because of the character limitation (and hypocrisy of the administration).",
