It often gets the best rates over at [airtm.com](https://airtm.com), and works well with [p2p.binance.com](https://p2p.binance.com). I usually only use it with **tether**, though (one time I used BUSD). It'd be a nice way to spread USDT adoption, ironically, because Tron & BSC are harder to use. USDT, assuming it doesn't collapse, is still very good for crypto. Ppl probably have a lot of money sitting idle in bank accounts due to the widespread fear of tether.",
