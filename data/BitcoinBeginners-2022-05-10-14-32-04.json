Which place sells such a huge amount of Bitcoins?\n2. How do they get it at the Market price?\n\nCan I assume this transaction was not p2p? Since most p2p transactions (which I have seen) sell btc above mid-market price by a considerable margin.",

They use a mix of exchanges to buy and sell for their clients , deal directly with large miners and deal with other large private buyers and sellers that help facilitate the trade \n\n>Can I assume this transaction was not p2p? \n\nIn most cases it is not. OTC brokers specialize in this and can bring down the costs even below what some retail buyers buy at",

They don't buy large amounts compared to the bigger funds or exchanges or stable coins these days.\n\nThey mostly rely on OTC brokers like cumberland.  They'll tell their broker to buy $100M of BTC and the broker will work the order over a day to severla weeks to get their order filled.\n\nThey won't just hit buy to fill their order. \n\nAnd given how small amounts El Salvador is buying and how liquid BTC is, their fills can probably be done over  a day or two.\n\nThe OTC brokers have a few other advantages, there really are only 2-3 of them that are able to deal in size so they get 90% of the block flow.  This allows them to do larger block trades which really helps keep slippage down, just like the old stock market days before computers.\n\nOccasionally these OTC guys will also act like liability traders and just buy a block of BTC or other crypto for a discount to market and their profit will be the delta between what they buy for and what they can unload the block for.",
