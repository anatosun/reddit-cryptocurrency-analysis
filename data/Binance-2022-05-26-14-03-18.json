Binance will use Kharon's industry-leading data and analytic platform to improve its sanctions screening and overall KYC controls as part of this partnership. In collaboration with Neterium, Kharon's data will be delivered into Binance's transaction screening environment. The collaboration will help to advance the development of data solutions aimed at improving the ability of cryptocurrency trading platforms to detect and prevent illicit activity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery 24 hours, Binance's crypto trade volume averages $24 billion USD. Binance is leading the crypto industry in developing a world-class cryptocurrency compliance program through the use of the most advanced know-your-customer, sanctions, and risk solutions to meet the needs of operating the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, which includes cryptos like Ethereum, which is the second largest cryptocurrency, Concordium which doubles down as a transaction network much faster than Solana which keeps breaking as well as probably one of the safest options available as its backed by literally science. Kharon's data and Neterium's technology, delivered via Binance's screening technology, enable Binance to improve its service to global clients while addressing increased risk and regulatory requirements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"As we continue to maintain and build the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, we are committed to building an industry-leading compliance program,\" says Chagri Poyraz, Global Head of Sanctions at Binance. Working with Kharon and Neterium enables us to address our risk by combining Kharon's best-in-class data with Neterium's innovative technology.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Virtual asset service providers require the highest quality data and technology to support their compliance programs,\" says Howard Mendelsohn, Chief Client Officer at Kharon. Collaboration with Binance to provide data and analytic tools is a critical step toward meeting expanding regulatory expectations and mitigating risk.\"",
