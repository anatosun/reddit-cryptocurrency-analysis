Swings between greed and fear. \n\nI do expect the mean return to decline through time. \n\nThe square root of the mean return is roughly 9.5%\n\n(I don't have any good justification for taking the square root of the mean, it just sounds safe for an asset with exponential adoption). \n\nSo my thinking is that you buy $100 of Bitcoin today wait at least 3 years and then sell a max of $9.50 annually.\n\nWouldn't it be almost guaranteed that your Bitcoin appreciated by 9.5% annually? \n\nI got this idea from the Jack Bogel people that use 4% from the stock market yields for retirement. \n\nIf someone bought 100k worth of Bitcoin today, and waited maybe even just a year and withdrew $9,500. \n\nIsn't it probable that their Bitcoin has appreciated more than the $9500 they initially withdrew? \n\nThis year will probably be the worst for Bitcoin but then we can have more data about the mean annual return. \n\nI don't plan on selling my Bitcoin for awhile, but let's say I lose my job. I could feel good selling 9.5% of my holdings and feel secure that the value will be the same within a year of withdrawal. \n\nDoes this make sense? \n\nI also understand the pitfalls of buying at the wrong times but this seems to become easier the more I learn about Bitcoin.",

Let\u2019s say it drops down to 50% gains over the next cycle, then 33% with the following cycle, then 25% etc.  Until it gets down to just beating inflation + 5%.  With 4 year cycles, you have at least 12 years of incredible gains.  You should be easily able to live off of your profits for the rest of your life if you initially invested 5 x your annual income.",
