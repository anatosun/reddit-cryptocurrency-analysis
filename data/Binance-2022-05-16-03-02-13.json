I think the chances of it going up to 1 cent are greater than 1% but if it does then that means that I can get around 1,000X total. If I had a thousand opportunities to invest in something with those odds then in general I would be coming out ahead while roulette is designed to average to a loss if done many times. The problem with LUNA is that you only have the 1 time to do it and it's 1,000X or nothing with a 99% chance of failure and so investing a lot is a stupid idea but investing a little is just gambling but with a good risk to reward ratio compared to any game whatsoever at a casino.",

I have screen shots of the MC going from $500 million to $40 billion on the 13/14th. I 4x my money and I didn't even catch a bottom or top.

I believe they are just waiting for a better price. Also, Wrapped Luna will be removed from CB on May 27th. That'll spice things up a bit too.",

What it is? I honestly have no idea but I think we are being tested, both the devs and the users. What we do now probably have great impact on the decades to come. \n\nLet us prove the critics wrong, that we are not in a bubble but pioneers of this technology. Yes we trade to accumulate fiat for now but what if the day comes that we don't need fiat anymore? Isn't it great to say to yourself one day that you're glad you were curious enough to invest your time and resources in a relatively risky endeavor and you were right about it?",
