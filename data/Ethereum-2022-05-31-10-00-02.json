            "selftext": "I might be biased cause I\u2019ve been part of the Ethereum community since 2018, but I genuinely think that Ethereum is the best chain out there right now. However, the only issue with it has always been traffic and gas fees.\n\nEthereum has always been plagued with this issue but I\u2019m starting to feel like it's slowly but surely becoming less and less of a problem with how fast L2s have been developing their tech.\n\nEthereum is taking a rollup-centric roadmap right now (specifically ZK rollups) and it will eventually integrate L2s into the blockchain in a way that makes them nearly inseparable from Ethereum. Vitalik talked a lot about it and he basically dreams of an Etherum where L2s aren't considered as an add-on anymore but more of a part of Ethereum that will end up being taken for granted with no second thought about them.  \nWe\u2019re already seeing a tom of exciting Zk development from projects like Zksync and Loopring recently.  \nEven Polygon takes the cake with ZK scaling solutions ready for use and $1 billion allocated for ZK tech development.\n\nAll of this effort and funds combined will end up making Ethereum problem less and less relevant, especially after the introduction of sharding which will basically put L2s on steroids.",
