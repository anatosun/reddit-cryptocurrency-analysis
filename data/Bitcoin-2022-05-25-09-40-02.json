I have asked multiple times on that forum but not a single answer from anyone. My question revolves more around the philosophy of the code than the coin that is implementing it. I even noticed several BTC devs are helping with this project.\n\nHow is it that they can implement Mimble Wimble but remain able to Interact with the lightning network? It was my understanding that MW does not allow for the scripting that would normally be used to create payment channels. I find it fascinating they are attempting this as obviously it could be a monumental upgrade to Bitcoin if they figure it all out..",
