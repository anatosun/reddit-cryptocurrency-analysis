I've got Hal at number 1, and then thinking Adam Back and Nick Szabo have to be in there somewhere, but those guys are relatively high visibility and perhaps there's other even more behind the scenes old-school cypherpunks that I should consider?  Maybe even an educator like Andreas Antonopoulos even though he joined the party later and didn't really have a huge impact on the codebase?\n\nI'm intending to \"honour\" (hopefully they take it that way anyway) these individuals as the 'artwork' in a series of songs - only done Hal so far ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM4MMreGN5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM4MMreGN5s))",

Never keep a copy of it recorded in the same home as your 24-words, in case you are burgled.\n\nHave a dedicated Raspberry Pi with up-to-date bitcoin software for managing your savings. Don't install any \"apps\" on this device.\n\n---\n\nThe advantages of this strategy:\n\n * No single point of failure. If you lose a copy of your 24-words, you should have backups.\n * If a thief discovers your 24-words, they can't access your savings (but they may take the balance from your spending wallet)\n * Moreover, if a thief spends the funds in your spending wallet, you know your 24-words are compromised, and you can move your savings to a new wallet before the thief could brute-force your passphrase.\n * The existence of the savings wallet is plausibly deniable to a potential extortionist (including government agencies)\n * Your family member/lawyer cannot access your savings without the 24-words.\n * If you die, your family member will discover your 24-word seed among your personal belongings, and will have/be able to obtain your passphrase from the lawyer, giving them access to your life savings.",

I'm aware there isn't a playbook for this but any insight to what is your frequency of purchase, do you allocate funds from a fixed pot or use % of your income and forth. \nI'm also wondering if you are buying pure BTC from peers, buying it on CEXes or using wrapped versions.\n\nMy goal is to not touch this for years and only possibly gain some APR from a safe source.\n\nThanks!",
