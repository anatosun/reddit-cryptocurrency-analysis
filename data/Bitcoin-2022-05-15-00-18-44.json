I've got Hal at number 1, and then thinking Adam Back and Nick Szabo have to be in there somewhere, but those guys are relatively high visibility and perhaps there's other even more behind the scenes old-school cypherpunks that I should consider?  Maybe even an educator like Andreas Antonopoulos even though he joined the party later and didn't really have a huge impact on the codebase?\n\nI'm intending to \"honour\" (hopefully they take it that way anyway) these individuals as the 'artwork' in a series of songs - only done Hal so far ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM4MMreGN5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM4MMreGN5s))",

It\u2019s just economists who have assumed money was developed to facilitate barter because of their familiarity with more recent commodity backed currencies rather than their knowledge of history.\n\nNote that [chartalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartalism) is related to the credit theory of money as it links government issued fiat currency with tax liabilities (i.e. debt). It is the ability to extinguish that debt that gives it value unlike a commodity backed currency which has value due to the underlying physical commodity.",

This is (more or less) the case now, but IT HAS NEVER BEEN THE CASE IN THE HISTORY. if you study the social structures of historical societies you will see money as a mere justification/tool for extraction of rent vassalism/feudalism/slave-powered capitalism up until middle of the last century. This is when ruling classes understood that to continue exercising control over masses you need to implement Fiat money, debased and have institutions like IMF, WB and monetary policy bodies. Through inflation they control how much of the value of your work ends up in their hands.\n\nBitcoin is actually an existential crisis to them, finally a free medium of exchange of value. But to view the previous money standards in this way is to ignore the historical and social reality of societies that used it.",

This is because if part of the phrase is compromised, there's not necessarily enough entropy stored in the remainder for the key to remain safe.\n\nIf you're serious about security you should be following a proven security protocol.\n\nSecurity protocols are created because keeping things secret is a common thing that many people need. Rather than every person coming up with their own \"scheme\", security experts create protocols. Because, frankly, most people don't understand information security and mathematics well enough to correctly evaluate the tradeoffs they would choose.\n\nHere are a couple of the more well-known protocols you could choose:\n\n- https://yeticold.com/ - Good security-cost ratio\n- https://glacierprotocol.org/ - Very secure but time-consuming and expensive\n\nWhich one you choose depends on the level of security you need. If you're serious about security, you need what is sometimes called a \"vault\" - a multisig set-up where the keys necessary to access the money are never physically in the same location. Some companies provide a vault service where they will hold one of the keys. Here are a couple, if you're interested in that (I'm not endorsing any):\n\n- https://unchained.com/\n- https://keys.casa/\n\nCasa is kind of expensive, but a personal vault with Unchained is free (they'll just charge if at any point you actually need their signature for a transaction, which you won't need as long as you keep control of the other keys).\n\nBottom line: Unless you're very certain about your digital information security knowledge, don't DIY security. Follow a protocol written by people who actually understand digital security and reviewed by other people who understand digital security. Create a multisig vault. Be careful about following security advice from random people on the internet who might know even less about digital security than you do.",

If you know what you are doing you can store your keys on the blockchain , you can translate your keys in a food recipe or anything : If you want to have proper security depending your needs , It's a question of accommodation which depends on your mental state and physical security. To eliminate central point of failure  you can look into multisig/SSS if you value the need for more security.   It might sound silly , at this point I prefer taking the risk of losing access to my funds than a thief using barbarian tactics to get it .",

Make a watch only wallet. Only use the seed when you\u2019re ready to redeem the coin. One use wallet cheap easy to store.\n2. Use public key cryptography with your existing private key encrypt the seed phrase store it separately from any salt you used to make your hidden HODL wallet.\n3. Use a cipher like auto key or vigenre and cipher it and etch it into a metal seed plate. \nReally comes down to what you\u2019re comfortable with. With #3 you could dial up or down the complexity.  Make it easier for your family members to crack but obfuscated to thieves.\n\nSomething I recommend though is consider there is a difference between your spend wallet and your savings wallets.  Your savings wallets should be receive only and impervious to attacks and damage while you could easily have many spend wallets with varying small petty cash amounts in hit wallets.  If you do make a spend hot wallet do it on your mobile device as they tend to have more hardened environments than desktop operating systems. \n\nJust my 2D.",
