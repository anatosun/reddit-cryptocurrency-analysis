De facto is latin and means in reality or in fact. The opposite is de jure which can be translated as in write or in law. By this logic, de facto and legal cannot be used in the same sentence.   Therefore:  \nMadeira - Has no intention of making Bitcoin *legal* legal tender (you hear how that sounds?) (source https://www.theblockcrypto.com/amp/post/142173/no-madeira-is-not-making-bitcoin-legal-tender)  \nLugano - Swiss franc is still the legal tender in Lugano. Bitcoin and USDT happen to be acceptable and the government encourages it - but it is not legal tender.

Here is some more info: [https://www.andorra-advisors.com/en/blog/bitcoin-andorra/](https://www.andorra-advisors.com/en/blog/bitcoin-andorra/)\n\nAs another commenter has remarked, some of these places are not countries in the post.\n\nPr\u00f3spera - A special economic zone on a Honduran island\r  \nLugano - A city in Switzerland.\r  \nMadeira - An autonomous archipelago in Portugal.\n\nNot mentioned in post, but El Salvador's monetary policy includes a provision for no capital gains on bitcoin as well.\n\nFinally, I think Vanuatu deserves a mention too.

Additionally chivo wallets are more likened to a traditional bank account than a personal bitcoin wallet, and this year the rate of adoption for chivo was like 0 percent after everyone signed up for the free money and then never used it again, something like 61% of people stopped using it immediately. Also El Salvador is on the brink of defaulting which will plunge its already fragile economy into chaos.\n\nI would say the El Salvador example of bitcoin as a legal tender is a pretty clear case of it failing about as miserably as possible.",
