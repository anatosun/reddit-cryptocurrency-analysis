            "selftext": "It becomes obvious to anyone looking.  You see some nothing coin suddenly surge 200-300% then dump in 24hr.  Then a diff coin the next day.  This is actually happening to multiple coins a day.  Easiest way to see is look at the top gainers on almost any exchange.  There are a few exceptions based on other factors but that usually pertains to the more established \"mainstream\" coins.  So it is obvious some factor with large sums picks a coin.  Pumps with their money usually when volume is low.  The price spikes.  It hits a predetermined number.  Then they dump and take their profit as the coin dumps down again.  Has anyone figured out who the whales are doing it?",
