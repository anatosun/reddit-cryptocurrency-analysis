Spent the last hour trying to get a hold of someone on the phone, email, chat, anything. I can't believe they can do this unilaterally and not provide an explanation, claim/appeals process, nothing. I can't even log in to my account and try to determine what the possible issue is. Hope I can get some assistance through this process.",
