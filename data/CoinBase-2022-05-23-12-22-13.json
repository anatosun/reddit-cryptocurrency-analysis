Now I'm realising I should have listened to all those people online who tried to warn others that they are no better than the rest of the crypto scams.\n\nI don't know what to do next. I have tried emailing and calling. I've had two open support tickets automatically closed with the message \"We hope you were able to get the help you needed. We're closing this case.\" despite me not receiving any information from Coinbase.\n\nOn my latest call I was told I could not be given **any information or guarantees** about when the case will be looked at or what has happened to my account.\n\nI have a recording of the call. It's pretty unbelievable.\n\nI'm effectively being told my money is gone.\n\nIt seems like legal involvement is going to be my only route from here because Coinbase are giving me nothing.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.",
