They will exist as long as people find it useful to convert between two systems.\n\nThis is how complex systems are built.\n\nPeople have found it useful for different payment networks to be connected to facilitate converting, so they built bridges to connect the two systems. That's it. As others pointed out, you can choose whatever on ramp you want. You don't need to go through a Bank to get Bitcoin. You can earn it. Or trade peer to peer.
