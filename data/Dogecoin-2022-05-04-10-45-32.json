Please note the different time scales.   \n\n\nDoge has had since 2013 to go to zero but it has not. Obscure and new game tokens have dumped in mere weeks and months. Double, triple, quadruple digit $ worth then dragged back down to earth in a short time span. Even other coins with unique tech like CHIA (storage based mining or something to that effect) experienced an exaggerated PnD.   \n\n\nDoge's PnD moment was only up to 0.70+$ then now back to 0.13$ which, for whatever worth, sounds quite reasonable compared to the other graphs you see here.",

Over the next decades the volatility will become much lower and user adoption will create a gradual increase in the price.\n\nThe aim and purpose is to get more people onboard to its practical uses. This means more businesses need to adopt the coin, the more it is adopted and the more transactions are made, the higher the value will go.\n\nMarket cap be damned.
