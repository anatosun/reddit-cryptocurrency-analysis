It's kinda like an air gap that keeps your crypto safe (untill you type the private key into some software to send money)\n\nThen you have hardware wallets like ledger that sign transactions on the device it's self. It is 1 way communication so even if your device is compromy you can still sign transactions and a hacker cannot get your keys.\n\nIt's a just safer way to sign transactions. metamask stores your keys on your computer protected by noting but a password. If someone can gain access to your computer either directly or via remote access it is pretty easy to steal those keys.\n\nAnd yes you can use the same key in meta mask, ledger, trezor or any sort of hardware / software that implements the BIP32 protocol",
