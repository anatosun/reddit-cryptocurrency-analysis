            "selftext": "I got into [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) a number of years ago, before the block size wars, before Bitcoin Cash existed. Back when BTC could still pass as the \"peer to peer electronic cash\".\n\nI believe financial privacy is important - when someone tells you privacy is dead, they are usually ignorant about the possibilities of strong cryptography and how it protects against exploitation (by criminals, by foreign governments, even by one's own government) or they are knowingly or unknowingly assisting psychological operations intended to reduce peoples' awareness of privacy as a right and frankly, something worth having and achievable if we engage ourselves for it.\n\nSo, I do like Monero's emphasis on privacy by default, while at the same time I like Bitcoin (now Bitcoin Cash) for its default transparency and making privacy available to those who want it (through e.g. CashFusion). I know some Monero people strongly disagree and believe that privacy is not achievable through opt-in. But I think this is not a settled matter. Combinatorics and pseudonymity at large scale (millions / billions of people using Bitcoin) can make compromise of financial privacy very costly.\n\nHowever, that's not my main point here.\n\nI want to make the point that the rise of Monero is good for all of p2p electronic cash.\n\nFirstly, it proves that there is some market interest in privacy. This is encouraging. Privacy does not come for free! Work has to be done to make it happen, and that work costs money. (This is also why I'm fine with people who have privacy use cases, paying extra for those, even on BCH through layered protocols such as CashFusion, or in the future perhaps, sidechains where all transactions are private similar to Monero).\n\nSecondly, it shows that even if a p2p cash coin has dropped by a lot in the past (I read that Monero had dropped down to even 50th spot?) there is potential for the coin to rise substantially.\n\nThe higher p2p cash coins rise compared to others, the better it will be for economic freedom and human rights (incl. privacy) in the world.\n\nSo I say to the Monero community: Well done, thanks for sticking to your guns, there is a long way ahead but the Bitcoin Cash community is fighting along side you for decentralized p2p cash, with complementary features.\n\nI don't think it's a zero sum game at all.",

But looking nowadays I really only see 3 cryptos that stick to this use-case-centric approach and are \"working as intended\" - Bitcoin Cash, Monero, and Avalanche (I don't trust it fully like I do BCH due to it being proof-of-stake, *but* the few transactions I did with it a while ago were actually really fast and cheaper than ETH, so I guess it is indeed delivering on some of its promises for now, just needs some more battle testing).",

Now, before you spout your bullshit:\n\n>Ciphertrace Announces Enhanced Monero Tracing Capabilities for Governments\n\nYes, Ciphertrace has indeed claimed to be capable of tracing Monero. A different few times, actually, in the last few years. All of which have been fruitless, and have had literally 0 proof supporting any of them besides them claiming to be able to do so. \n\nThe company also stated that their supposedly-functional tracing method is probabilistic. They watch for any new transactions which select a \"marked\" ring member, and then watch for any transactions which select those ones, and so on. This can be used to construct a \"tree\" of theoretical destinations. The issue is, this doesn't work at all, because the probabilities dissolve to sub 0.1% levels within a few hours of transactions (and continue to fall forever) and there's no way to know if or when a marked output has been spent. This is not a novel idea, and has been known since day 1. The MRL has actually done a good amount of work on researching and discussing this, and not only intuitively but even more so as demonstrated by them, this method is completely incapable of tracing anything.\n\n>Most Monero transactions made prior to February 2017 are traceable.\n\nI find it odd that you aren't linking to the actual report here, because there was an actual paper written on this, not just some random site online. But anyway, yes, Monero used to have quite broken privacy. Allowing low/0-mixin inputs revealed the true spend on many many outputs, which led to an unintentional chain reaction attack. The introduction of RingCT and mandatory mixins prevented people from using low/0-mixins, and also fixed other issues related to that which I'm not going to get into here. Hence the issue was resolved.\n\nWhy weren't mandatory mixins in place since day 1? I don't know, but they clearly should have been. Optional privacy, especially when the protocol relies on the set of all outputs, was a garbage system that shouldn't have been used in the first place.\n\n>Monero's main selling point is privacy. That promise doesn't work, 'cause there are several ways to track it. Did you use Monero yesterday? If so, check the list below, you might be on it.\n\nLol, this one isn't helping your case at all. If you're going to spread bullshit lies, then at least do it properly. The guy who made this is a well-known fraud (not only due to this but just in general) and the site is hilariously bad. IPs were pulled from whichever node the hostile node received the tx from as it was being propagated through the network (which iirc hilariously also included some Tor exit nodes), which is completely worthless. Then he made up some random \"porn preference\", and posted it. It's a self-parody of Monero FUD.",

The monero community is also manipulating the price of cryptocurrencies so that Monero looks larger and bigger than its competition.

Market cap rankings are also manipulated to make certain coins look larger than others. This is likely accomplished by Tether and BTC pairings. Look, Monero has infinite inflation, its privacy doesn't work [Monero Privacy Protections Aren't as Strong as They Seem | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/monero-privacy/), and the community is heavily astroturfed.\n\nMonero doesn't have any real adoption or acceptance anywhere, not even darknet markets. Btc, Bitcoin Cash and Eth all have higher adoption on DNMs than monero does. The problem is that someone is interested in manipulating cryptocurrency markets to prevent truly effective cryptocurrencies from rising to the front, and they're spending a lot of money to manipulate the ranks and cheat for monero and BTC, and to a lesser degree Litecoin, so that you can be marshalled back into their clutches. Cryptocurrency prices have not reflected the true market since roughly 2018-2019. The Monero community also manipulates fair value to make it look larger than it really is.",
