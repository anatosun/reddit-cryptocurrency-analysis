            "selftext": "I got into [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) a number of years ago, before the block size wars, before Bitcoin Cash existed. Back when BTC could still pass as the \"peer to peer electronic cash\".\n\nI believe financial privacy is important - when someone tells you privacy is dead, they are usually ignorant about the possibilities of strong cryptography and how it protects against exploitation (by criminals, by foreign governments, even by one's own government) or they are knowingly or unknowingly assisting psychological operations intended to reduce peoples' awareness of privacy as a right and frankly, something worth having and achievable if we engage ourselves for it.\n\nSo, I do like Monero's emphasis on privacy by default, while at the same time I like Bitcoin (now Bitcoin Cash) for its default transparency and making privacy available to those who want it (through e.g. CashFusion). I know some Monero people strongly disagree and believe that privacy is not achievable through opt-in. But I think this is not a settled matter. Combinatorics and pseudonymity at large scale (millions / billions of people using Bitcoin) can make compromise of financial privacy very costly.\n\nHowever, that's not my main point here.\n\nI want to make the point that the rise of Monero is good for all of p2p electronic cash.\n\nFirstly, it proves that there is some market interest in privacy. This is encouraging. Privacy does not come for free! Work has to be done to make it happen, and that work costs money. (This is also why I'm fine with people who have privacy use cases, paying extra for those, even on BCH through layered protocols such as CashFusion, or in the future perhaps, sidechains where all transactions are private similar to Monero).\n\nSecondly, it shows that even if a p2p cash coin has dropped by a lot in the past (I read that Monero had dropped down to even 50th spot?) there is potential for the coin to rise substantially.\n\nThe higher p2p cash coins rise compared to others, the better it will be for economic freedom and human rights (incl. privacy) in the world.\n\nSo I say to the Monero community: Well done, thanks for sticking to your guns, there is a long way ahead but the Bitcoin Cash community is fighting along side you for decentralized p2p cash, with complementary features.\n\nI don't think it's a zero sum game at all.",

The monero community is also manipulating the price of cryptocurrencies so that Monero looks larger and bigger than its competition. Cryptocurrency prices are easy to manipulate, especially monero since its only on a few exchanges. Exchanges are centralized websites that don't actually provide the true market price that the holders of coins are trading at.\n\nInstead, the provide the last \"spot price\". Market cap rankings are also manipulated to make certain coins look larger than others. This is likely accomplished by Tether and BTC pairings. Look, Monero has infinite inflation, its privacy doesn't work [Monero Privacy Protections Aren't as Strong as They Seem | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/monero-privacy/), and the community is heavily astroturfed.\n\nMonero doesn't have any real adoption or acceptance anywhere, not even darknet markets. Btc, Bitcoin Cash and Eth all have higher adoption on DNMs than monero does. The problem is that someone is interested in manipulating cryptocurrency markets to prevent truly effective cryptocurrencies from rising to the front, and they're spending a lot of money to manipulate the ranks and cheat for monero and BTC, and to a lesser degree Litecoin, so that you can be marshalled back into their clutches. Cryptocurrency prices have not reflected the true market since roughly 2018-2019. The Monero community also manipulates fair value to make it look larger than it really is.",

All of which have been fruitless, and have had literally 0 proof supporting any of them besides them claiming to be able to do so. \n\nThe company also stated that their supposedly-functional tracing method is probabilistic.

This can be used to construct a \"tree\" of theoretical destinations. The issue is, this doesn't work at all, because the probabilities dissolve to sub 0.1% levels within a few hours of transactions (and continue to fall forever) and there's no way to know if or when a marked output has been spent.

But anyway, yes, Monero used to have quite broken privacy. Allowing low/0-mixin inputs revealed the true spend on many many outputs, which led to an unintentional chain reaction attack. The introduction of RingCT and mandatory mixins prevented people from using low/0-mixins, and also fixed other issues related to that which I'm not going to get into here. Hence the issue was resolved.\n\nWhy weren't mandatory mixins in place since day 1? I don't know, but they clearly should have been. Optional privacy, especially when the protocol relies on the set of all outputs, was a garbage system that shouldn't have been used in the first place.\n\n>Monero's main selling point is privacy.

Knock it off!\n\n>The company also stated that their supposedly-functional tracing method is probabilistic. \n\nThis is a monero red-herring. Everything in the world barring a few things is probabilistic. When you work in code there's always a probability that something can go wrong. If you're working on crucial software that probability needs to be taken into account. Saying something is \"probabilistic\" doesn't mean \"not true\" or \"not determinable\".\n\n> The issue is, this doesn't work at all, because the probabilities dissolve to sub 0.1% levels \n\nThis is wrong. For example, from 2014 to at 2017 the probabilty of tracing Monero transactions was 90% for ring sizes > 0. For ring sizes = 0 it was 100%! The VAST majority of Monero's transactions in its first three years were TRACEABLE. After they \"fixed\" the issues, which fluffypony is quoted to have said really couldn't be fixed, the probability went to 45%, then 23% and further based on the number of other decoys. Right now that number is 10 and there is a significant non-zero percent\nchance that your transaction can be identified. There were at least three sidechannel attacks that nearly guaranteed Monero could be traced. \n\n>This is not a novel idea, and has been known since day 1.\n\nBeing \"known\" is not the same thing as being mitigated and its completely dishonest for you to write that. \n\n>The MRL has actually done a good amount of work on researching and discussing this, and not only intuitively but even more so as demonstrated by them, this method is completely incapable of tracing anything.\n\nDiscussing something and researching on it is not the same thing as stopping it from happening. And you're wrong, these transactions are easily traceable. This is why ciphertrace claims they can trace monero transactions, because THEY CAN.\n\n>I find it odd that you aren't linking to the actual report here\n\nWhy? Everyone knows about it, you can just google it. \n\n>But anyway, yes, Monero used to have quite broken privacy.\n\nOkay so why do you think you can get away with calling my post \"bullshit\" above you scammer? You just admitted that everything I said is true. This is why I can't stand your community, you're all a bunch of slimy word-playing liars! This one sentence is ALL YOU NEED to stay away from Monero. Privacy is important and NO OTHER COIN has been broken as much privacy-wise as Monero. Although ZCash has had some breaks, at least their attempts to fix their privacy actually did the job. Their anon-set is over 4 billion. Monero's is only 10 which makes all these traces WAY MORE VIABLE.\n\n>Allowing low/0-mixin inputs revealed the true spend on many many outputs, which led to an unintentional chain reaction attack.\n\nMISLEADING. 0-mixin outputs were EXCLUDED from the report because they were completely easy to trace.  EVEN with 10 mixins the probability of determining a the source of the transaction was 60%!!! That is STUPENDOUSLY HIGH for a privacy coin and much higher than ANY OTHER privacy option! You shame yourself for so aggressively defending a scam.\n\n>Hence the issue was resolved.\n\nThe issue was NOT resolved, it was only fixed A LITTLE. The probability went from 90% traceable to around 45% using timing attacks. Fluffypony is ON RECORD ADMITTING that \"this isn't a problem you can solve by just pecking away at it\". And most recently the OSPEAD attack proves once again that monero's privacy is completely broken. The details of this attack were released earlier this year and have of course functioned since Monero began. But they also make tracing monero transactions possible, SO YOU SHOULD STOP LYING!\n\n>Why weren't mandatory mixins in place since day 1? \n\nMandatory mixins is not the issue, Monero's privacy was broken even up to 10 mixins with a greater than 50% chance of guessing the correct spend!\n\n>Lol, this one isn't helping your case at all. \n\nYou're just saying that, but you're the one spewing bullshit here. You call my post \"bullshit lies\" then admit to EVERYTHING I SAID. That makes you a LIAR and A SCAMMER! Nothing I've written is false, you are the one spewing bullshit here.\n\n>The guy who made this is a well-known fraud \n\nNo, your community calls him a fraud but you're just a community of LIARS! He correctly proved that monero is still traceable and there are quite a few ways in fact. So you bribing communities to pal-around with to make it seem like you have organic support across the board WON'T HELP YOU!\n\n>which is completely worthless\n\nAny attack that links personal information, like IP addresses is NOT worthless.

Alright, I'm Satoshi, and I need you to donate 10 BTC to me please.\n\nAnd why is it on me to prove that they're lying, when they're the one making the claim? Look up Russell's Teapot.\n\nAnother thing, it's funny to me that *you're* accusing *me* of being emotionally invested in Monero, when you're the one who's losing your shit by SCREAMING IN ALL CAPS, and regurgitating tired old FUD parrot points in a desperate reach to discredit Monero.\n\n>This is wrong.

So why are you going back to it when we're talking about right now? Also ringsizes of 0 don't exist but ok lol. I think you mean 0-mixins, ringsize 1?\n\n>Okay so why do you think you can get away with calling my post \"bullshit\" above you scammer? You just admitted that everything I said is true.\n\nNo, I said that Monero was broken in the past. It is not anymore. Stop twisting my words. I can't tell if you're doing this on purpose or if you're just an idiot. This is not a hard concept.\n\n>Although ZCash has had some breaks, at least their attempts to fix their privacy actually did the job. Their anon-set is over 4 billion. Monero's is only 10 which makes all these traces WAY MORE VIABLE.\n\nThat's not how anon sets work. First of all, Zcash is way below 4 billion, it is equal to the number of all shielded outputs (until if/when there are 4 billion of those, which will not be for an extremely long time, if at all). Second, ringsize is not the anon set in Monero. Monero's anon set is not a static number, but it is far far larger than 11. The anon set functions similarly to Whirlpool Coinjoin (but with differences and improvements), and that is a good starting resource if you're interested in actually understanding how it works.\n\n>MISLEADING. 0-mixin outputs were EXCLUDED from the report because they were completely easy to trace. EVEN with 10 mixins the probability of determining a the source of the transaction was 60%!!! That is STUPENDOUSLY HIGH for a privacy coin and much higher than ANY OTHER privacy option! You shame yourself for so aggressively defending a scam.\n\nThat's not what I'm talking about. So imagine you have 2 transactions, one with a single ring member, TXO1, and another with 2, TXO1 & TXO2. Since TXO1 was known to be spent in the first tx, it can be eliminated from the second. Therefore, TXO2 has been spent. This is a small scale example, but rinse and repeat over the course of thousands of transactions. And I'm not making this up, if you don't believe me then read the paper yourself.\n\n>Any attack that links personal information, like IP addresses is NOT worthless. And this isn't the only attack that works on monero. If you combine any two attacks like this and say the OSPEAD attack you have IDENTIFYING INFORMATION!\n\nI don't think you're understanding what I'm saying. He did not extract the tx's origin IP. Not even the node which the user was connected to. He monitored for transactions being transmitted from (not *sent from*, or *originated from*) *the peers of his node* while the transaction was being broadcasted through the network.\n\nAlso, I'd love to know how exactly you'd imagine that this \"vulnerability\" could be solved. Can't use Tor, because by your measure, knowing the exit node is TMI. Similar issue with I2P. Quantum teleportation, maybe?\n\n>There was a bug in Monero that wasn't fixed until sept 2020 IIRC. That bug allowed you to CORRECTLY IDENTIFY ANYONE WHO RECEIVED MONERO!!! You are a LIAR, A BULLSHIT ARTIST AND A SCAMMING ASSHOLE!\n\nFirst of all it would be the other way (senders). Like I said, if you're going to spread bullshit, at least do it correctly. But it still didn't work. It was random BS claims attached to publicly available information. Oh no, the horror.\n\nMan, I love it when you doofi get so angry and project your issues onto others.",
