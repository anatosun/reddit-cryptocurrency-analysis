Based on my experience with coinbase, I stored my cryptos in that wallet and I made a decision to move it out because I felt like it wasn't reliable anymore. I deposited btc to my coinbase wallet before but it didn't credit to my account even though the transaction was completed. So I transferred my coins into Netcoins. I was glad because I didn't have to spend a large amount on the fees to deposit. So yeah I do recommend it.",
