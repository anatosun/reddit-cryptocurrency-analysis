The exchange I used to get my hands on it to begin with was Sideshift, but they have removed the coin. I contacted both them and my wallet (Bitcoin.com) to see what my options were. Turns out Bitfinex is the only place I can exchange at.\n\nProblem is Bitfinex requires intermediate level of verification to exchange stablecoins. I am not interested in doing KYC there since  the regulation around crypto is very confusing in my country right now so I don't wanna mess with stuff until some clarity is there.\n\nSo this is where I need help: Is anyone willing to take the USDT off my hands and converting it themselves? (I am willing to keep it as favorable for you as possible; I will give you a discount of $100. We will use the marketplace at memo.cash for doing the deal so no one will be scammed).\n\nPlease PM me if you are interested! \n\nThanks",
