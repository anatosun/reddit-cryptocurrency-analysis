            "selftext": "So rumers are circulating that Putin has some sort of cancer and that the only way for Russia to save face with the war on Ukraine is for him to be deposed/ dispose of. Russian oligarchs could then move to end sanctions saying it was all him, wasn't us, and let's get on with making money again. If this was to happen, and for WW3 to be no longer imminently possible, would the following positive sentiment drive Bitcoin to finally achieve the 2021 goal of 100k? Quickly? \nAsking for a friend living on 2 minute noodles.",

The move may prevent the firm from facilitating the purchase and sale of Bitcoins in US dollars at a time when use of the currency has mushroomed.
