Due to the way Amazon warehouses work, just because you buy from a trusted source does not mean you will actually receive your wallet from that source.  The warehouse can just grab a Ledger from another seller, because it's the same product, and send it to you as if it's from the source you purchased from.\n\nSome will say that is too paranoid, but when it comes to crypto I'd rather be too paranoid than lose everything.",

For your words, its highly recommended to put them onto something more sturdy like metal and then you don't have to worry about a fire or water damaging it.\n\nFor ledger (or any hardware wallet) if you buy directly from their site or from an authorized reseller then that's the best option for trying to buy a wallet. Ledger specifically will list their resellers on the website.",

A metal plate is better in case of fire, but thats your only real concern. \n\nUse passphrases and store them seperatly for better security. \n\nTrezor is better than ledger imo. \n\nStart by withdrawing a small amount. Wipe the wallet and restore to gain confidence. Then you'll probably feel comfortable enough withdrawing the rest.",
