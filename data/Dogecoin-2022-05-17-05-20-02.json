He takes effort to understand the engineering problem so that he can make an informed decision and seems to legitimately value the input of his engineers when they say something.\n\nNow that said, he's not afraid to override their concerns and put his foot down for better or worse. All the high profile items are of course the times where this has turned out well (Ex: switching from carbon fiber to steel for Starship/Superheavy) and the times where this has NOT turned out well mostly go unreported (Ex: pushing for near-total automation on Tesla's assembly lines).\n\nThere is some use in having someone on the team who conversant in the field but isn't 100% knowledgeable on it (IE: The difference between knowing all the theory about an engine and how it works, but not having a perfect grasp of the physics/chemistry/etc). We engineers/programmers/etc have a strong tendency to get sucked into the minutia and particulars of our projects. Theoretical possibilities that are just so close are super tempting and it's easy to get yourself sucked into going for them when you really need to settle for something lesser to actually be able to ship a product. Especially when you basically have a limitless budget and high profile failures are celebrated rather than resulting in inquiries and firing.",

Type \"Errol Musk emerald mine\"\n\nJust the first result that came up, not looking too hard at all:\n\n\n> Errol Musk. In the mid-1980s, the family profited handsomely from **Errol Musk\u2019s purchasing of an emerald mine**, after selling their airplane for \u00a380,000 (the equivalent of \u00a3320,000 today).\n\n> \u201cWe went to this guy\u2019s prefab and he opened his safe and there was just stacks of money and he paid me out, \u00a380,000, it was a huge amount of money,\u201d Errol Musk said, according to Business Insider. Errol Musk was then made another offer: to spend \u00a340,000 on an emerald mine. \u201cI said, \u2018Oh, all right\u2019. So I became a half owner of the mine, and we got emeralds for the next six years,\u201d Errol Musk said.\n\n> **As a result of this, the teenage Elon Musk once walked the streets of New York with emeralds in his pocket. His father said: \u201cWe were very wealthy. We had so much money at times we couldn\u2019t even close our safe,\u201d** adding that one person would have to hold the money in place with another closing the door. \u201cAnd then there\u2019d still be all these notes sticking out and we\u2019d sort of pull them out and put them in our pockets.\u201d -- https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-50th-taking-look-140658511.html\n\nNow you'd be right to argue, \"Nothing there proves there was any slavery involved.\" Perhaps so.\n\nAs a counterpoint, rarely is there some written record of slavery in modern times, and Elon Musk apparently acknowledges his father was a terrible person. In a society not very friendly to black people that has driven them to destitution - well, living in America I can't help but imagine how much worse still things would be going for black people without a strong federal government. Perhaps slavery is too strong a word, I'll yield only that.\n\n**But surely Vitalik having a pre-mine that caused no harm to any humans is not as bad as getting your wealth from an emerald mine and that's the real point.**",

It is like saying Thomas Edison or Steve Jobs shouldn't be given any credit because it was the technicians who helped manufacture the product. Or to go one step further, credits should go to the miners who mined the silicones or minerals that goes into making the bulb.  Tesla and SpaceX is a collective effort but arguably, none of these would be where it is today without Musk. You think new innovations will magically appear out of thin air? You think scientists and engineers wake up one day and decide to suddenly organise themselves to create new products? And if you think he is just another businessman who deserves no credits to his innovations, go look at his presentations and tell me if that seems like an absent-minded CEO who just spouts the vision and takes a hands-off approach.",

They didn't even let Oscar speak, the man had like five words and he is the main person working on the thing they are meeting to talk about.\n\nI'm not saying Vitalik and Elon aren't going to help or provide resources but don't expect an active role in any of this, they have their own projects and agendas, how much free time or care for doge do you think these guys actually have .",
