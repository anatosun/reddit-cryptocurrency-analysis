            "selftext": "Hello /r/ethereum,\n\nOur timing for this release couldn\u2019t be much worse but bears haven\u2019t stopped us building before and they won\u2019t stop us now.\n\n[Numio](https://www.numio.one/) is a non-custodial, Layer 2 Ethereum, mobile app available on Android and iOS. First released in 2020, we were the first app to be built on zkSync.\n\n## What's new?\n\n**Layer 2 Swaps** \\- we\u2019ve added Layer 2 Swaps with our [ZigZag](https://info.zigzag.exchange/) integration which means you can swap tokens quickly and cheaply on the zkSync network.\n\nThe cost for a swap is currently under $0.50 - the cheapest I have swapped for is \u00a30.07.\n\nWe\u2019ve added the following pairs for now but will be adding loads more (>75) very soon.\n\n* ETH/USDC\n* ETH/USDT\n* USDC/USDT\n\n**Layer 2 fiat on-ramp** \\- you can now purchase crypto directly on zkSync. This feature is supported by our [MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/) integration and saves you a lot on gas fees.\n\n**NFTs** \\-You can view and interact with your NFT collection in the app.\n\n## A Note on Privacy and Fees on Numio\n\nNumio is non-custodial - you generate your own private keys within the app and can download your private keys at any time.\n\nYou can stay pseudonymous - you don\u2019t need to give an email, phone number, or complete KYC to use Numio - all you need is a username.\n\nDownloading and signing up for Numio is free. Whether you are using Layer 1 or Layer 2, we won\u2019t charge you to make an account or create a wallet.\n\n## Feedback\n\nAs always we appreciate all the feedback we get, so please let us know if you have any comments, requests, or criticisms - we\u2019re always working to improve.\n\nThanks",
