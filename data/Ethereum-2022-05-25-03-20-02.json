            "selftext": "I heard that [Proof of Stake will only reduce block time by \\~1 second to 12s](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer/). Why only 1 second?\n\nIntuitively, it would seem to me that Proof of Stake (PoS) should be able to drastically reduce block times vs. Proof of Work since it replaces the computationally expensive PoW piece and the arms race nature of everyone mining at the same time with random validator assignment. Thus the bottleneck under PoS would only be the network latency it takes to propagate the newly created block to the number of validators required for consensus (51%?) + time it takes for those validators to validate/attest that newly created block and propagate their attestation back to everyone else. I don't know what the block propagation latency on ethereum is to reach 51% of nodes, but I can't imagine that being more than a few seconds.\n\nI understand that reducing block times too low under Proof of Work would be offset by increased computational waste and forking (due to everyone mining concurrently and network latency). But wouldn't this problem be eliminated under Proof of Stake, thus enabling faster block times (and subsequently higher transactions/second)? **(EDIT: I elaborated on my reasoning in** [**this comment**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/slzfsd/comment/hvtw4et/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**)**\n\nIs there a detailed explanation/analysis somewhere comparing Proof of Stake vs. Proof of Work from a performance standpoint? Why is Proof of Stake only 1 second faster than Proof of Work?\n\n*PS: I don't pretend to deeply understand this stuff, so I'm looking forward to my misconceptions being torn apart.*",

                    "response": "The limits on making block time faster have to do with safety and decentralization (specifically, avoiding scenarios where nodes with much better network connections have a large economic advantage, which risks leading to ethereum mining or staking centralizing on eg. AWS).\n\nIn **proof of work**, the core problem is that blocks come at random times; if the average block time is 13s, that means that there is a 1/13 chance that the next  two blocks will come within 1 second of each other. When two blocks appear that close together, the miner with a better network connection has an advantage in propagating their blocks first, and so could beat out the second. This effect is tolerable with 13s block times, especially with [uncle rewards](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uncle-block-cryptocurrency.asp) reducing the economic penalty of having your block appear slightly too late. But it becomes a huge problem with eg. 3s block times.\n\nIn **proof of stake**, blocks arrive evenly once per 12 sec, so that problem does not exist. However, another problem appears. Our version of proof of stake attempts to give blocks a very high level of confirmation after even one slot, and this requires thousands of signatures (currently ~9100) per slot to get included in the next slot. This process incurs latency and takes time. The time is more like logarithmic than linear (so, cutting the slot time in half and doing ~4550 signatures per slot would not work, as each now-shorter slot would still take _almost_ as long), but aggregating that many signatures is still a big deal and requires multiple rounds of network communication. This process probably _could_ be done safely in 6s or even a bit less, but the problem is that at that point quite a few signatures would not get included on-chain on time, and the rewards would once again start to really favor highly centralized actors. The current ~12s is conservative and gives us a good buffer against such risks.\n\nI don't expect the per-slot time to be reduced much in the future. Though what is looking more and more likely is [single-slot finality](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/single_slot_finality), which will mean that a single slot would actually finalize a transaction instead of just strongly confirming it as it does today. Applications that need really fast confirmations would have to rely on either channels or rollups with sequencers providing pre-confirmations. That said, we are also actively researching in-protocol mechanisms that could give users reasonably strong assurance after only a few seconds that some transaction will get included in either the next or another near-future block.",

It seems that it ultimately boils down to ensuring that validators with slower connections can still attest and receive rewards. And as others already mentioned, ensuring that nodes wouldn't need higher storage requirements.\n\nI'm still curious about the 12s figure because from a layman's perspective it seems kind of long given that blocks are only 80KB, and thus would sound like something that could be done closer to 6 seconds like you said (I'd guess a couple seconds to receive the block, a couple seconds to validate, a couple seconds to send it off). On another note, I wonder how long it takes to propagate a 80KB block to the 2/3 of validators required to validate a block.\n\nWe all know that there are other alt-l1s with significantly faster block times. When they talk about their faster transaction times and lower gas fees, the standard response is \"well they sacrifice decentralization\". Which is true, but it would be more constructive to be able to explain/quantify what exactly the tradeoffs are, and how 12s was determined to be the optimal block time.\n\nThe single-slot finality and fast strong assurance on block inclusion sound like huge improvements! Thanks again for all your hard work :)",

While this sharding provides ample storage space for Layer 2s like rollups to store data related to state, the main-chain validation of rollup execution is either done through a challenge period as in optimistic rollups, or through a zero knowledge validity proof as in zk rollups.\n\nCardano's Hydra is an evolution of the state channel design, and is more akin to a very fancy version of Bitcoin's Lightning Network. My understanding of it is that it has similar constraints in terms of every involved party needing to be online to prevent fraud during a challenge period, whereas Ethereum's RADS (Rollup And Data Shards) design requires only a single honest node in the whole rollup to construct a fraud proof during the challenge period in the case of optimistic rollups, and for zk rollups requires no fraud proofs or challenge period at all, as every step of the network's execution that is submitted to L1 is guaranteed to be valid due to the zk validity proof.\n\nThe end result is that while Hydra inherits some of the safety and liveness limitations inherent to state channels, because at its core it's a state channel system. Rollups, being mostly unrelated to state channel tech, can largely sidestep those limitations. Please ask me if there's anything I could have explained better about that, or anything I can clarify.\n\nThere's also this excellent write up by /u/Liberosist which I highly recommend reading, in fact it's probably better than the structureless rambling I've written here. Basically, Hydra is highly polished 2015 state channel tech, zk rollups are newly emerged 2021 tech that solve a lot of the issues inherent to state channels.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/pf25jk/without_hydra_cardano_probably_wont_be_faster/hb1s8z6/",

Every answer to a \"why don't we just reduce block times\" post I've seen always talks about \"orphan rates\", which are entirely eliminated by Proof of Stake. Thus it would seem to me that Proof of Stake enables faster block times than Proof of Work. But since ethereum decided that block times should be 12 seconds, we keep it at 12 seconds. Would like to see resources discussing the tradeoffs of faster block times under proof of stake.",

                            "response": "Ok I'll elaborate more on my explanation:\n\nUnder Proof of Work, block time (correct me if I'm wrong) is basically just a function of the mining difficulty. Reduce the mining difficulty, and you've reduced the block times. The problem is that if you reduce the mining difficulty / block times too much, then eventually the network latency starts to result in more blocks simultaneously being mined before they can be fully propagated to the others. This means more forking and having to reconcile these forks (higher orphan rate), which is all wasted time since forks are just thrown away.\n\nHowever, Proof of State totally eliminates the \"mining difficulty\" part of the equation, replacing it with a simple random validator assignment. Instead of every validator simultaneously racing to solve the mining puzzle, only one validator creates a block at a time, and the rest validate the legitimacy of that block (attestation).\n\nIntuitively, it would follow that block times could be drastically reduced under Proof of Stake, since now the only lower bound is the network latency and there's no dealing with fork reconciliations. Validators don't have to waste time on hashing puzzles, they simply create a new block when told, and validate other blocks when not.\n\nI wasn't able to find any metrics on the time it takes an ethereum block to propagate to the rest of the network, but it's hard for me to imagine that being more than a few seconds for 50% of the network since block sizes are only \\~80kb. If this number were say 3 seconds, it would seem that Proof of Stake should be able to take block times closer to that.\n\nAgain I imagine my mental model of how this all works is totally incorrect. Would love for someone to point out the errors in my assumptions + reasoning (even better if accompanied with numbers)",

That means a cheap connection and cheap hardware makes a perfectly suited node. And it runs over TOR too, so the speed is more like 5mbit/s.\n\nIn a couple years, you can run full nodes on your phone, maybe.\n\nThis would not be possible at all with ETH as a consequence of having fast block time. My disks would be too big and expensive and my Internet would need to be faster (sometimes blocks come in way faster too).\n\nEventually you need to make some assumption of what speeds 99% of the node operators reach reliably, and it could be easily just 1mbit/s.",

There is nothing magical about 12s. They undoubtedly did a lot of research on block times, and they concluded that something around 12s would be safe. In the end, the exact choice is arbitrary.

It includes a margin of safety.\n\nWith only 6 seconds, that guarantee is somewhat less strong. You might risk moving forward in block production before poorly connected nodes are able to receive the previous message. Like imagine a node running in a country with poor internet infrastructure, plus their ISP is having some transient issues. Let's say that normally, messages take 4 seconds for a round trip time (RTT) to nodes on that particular ISP, but it's plausible that with some network instability, a message could take more than 6 seconds for RTT and they would miss the cutoff.\n\nWith 1 second, it's very obvious that a message would not be able to propagate around the world within that amount of time. The network would quickly devolve into a degenerate state, with a small group of well-connected nodes being the only ones able to attempt to build on the chain.\n\nWhy *exactly* 12 seconds? Nobody knows. 3 seconds is very obviously too short, and 30 seconds is obviously too long, so the developers' choice of 12 seconds seems reasonable enough.\n\n> So it seems that Proof of Stake theoretically does enable drastically lower block times, but we're not going to do it due to not wanting to increase storage requirements of nodes.\n\nI've explained why PoS does not inherently enable drastically lower block times due to the nature of chain conditions under latency, but as a side note, block times are mostly independent of storage requirements. Processing 500 transactions into two smaller, more frequent blocks of 250 transactions each takes up roughly the same amount of storage space as processing one big 500 tx block.",
