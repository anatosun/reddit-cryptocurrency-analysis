The idea is to invest the profits from increased power demand to make the grid more robust. When they have a freeze and not enough power to go around to everyone, they raise the price of power to where Bitcoin miners are no longer profiting so they can service everyone using power for essentials like heat lights food etc. I get that it\u2019s the cool thing to hate on republicans, but please stop shooting down good ideas because they\u2019re not on your side or whatever.",
