I personally ran into her in 2021 and lost my family savings, my wife is still angry, and I hate this industry myself. This is a gold mine for scammers, there is as much deception as you can imagine. I advise you to withdraw your blood money from there and not pull fate for one place. Wait for more transparent and controlled crypto projects for investment.\n\nNFTs that no one will buy from you, but you have paid for their minting and placement; distributions with commission payment; \"multiplications\"; coins, from which the developer unexpectedly withdraws liquidity to his wallet through a multiaccount; hacking of wallets and exchanges allegedly by hackers and other murky schemes - this is a brief history of cryptocurrencies.\n\nP.S. I have seen honest projects, but there are very few of them and it is unrealistic to sort them from the scam until you get in.",
