I'm a little confused on the derivation paths.\n\nSpecifically, https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ will generate valid ETH addresses in some cases, but not others.\n\nValid:    \n\n`m/0` for eth:  \n> 0x9D4C68703fA6638B6B5f061999F7c5bD3f58F64e\n  \n`m/44'/60'/0'/0`:  \n> 0xaFeC42a19b08483e641d245960a80879620Ae966\n\nInvalid:  \n\n`m/49'/60'/0'/0`:  \n> 3E5TKWX434EQQAkqEFhvAFirjCWGARB8Sg\n  \n`m/84'/60'/0'/0`:  \n> bc1qfn22xjd66jzdty78nggzlrwtrxyckfmu7lvgam\n\nIs the site missing something for ETH in the second two, or is there just no valid ETH address for those standards? \n\nIf I use the same mnemonic phrase and the same \"purpose\" for all my coins, does that mean I'm stuck with bip-44 for my btc and others?\n\nWikipedia said the address needs to start 0x and is a specific hash of the public key. Would I be able to do that to turn the invalid addresses Into valid ones, or will that result in a random address that my private key doesn't access?",
