But what if i told you the original project that baked beans sourced its code from has been running for over a year now, and paying 3% daily every single day? This has been my most profitable investment when it comes to nodes or anything of the sort. Contract is up 600 bnb in the last 3 weeks, over a year after launch! Everyone should do themselves the favor of making sure their portfolio is secured with some amazing passive income! I dont expect most people to try it, but for those that do, you definitely will not be disappointed. ESPECIALLY with daily 100% back events on any bnb deposits. That is FREE money. The dev is one of the smartest and dedicated people i have ever seen in this space, and is in the telegram daily. Dont miss out. Its never too early or too late with this one.  \n \n\nhttps://bnbminer.finance/?ref=0x06DD87AaFEC9768Ba1fb07355869DB0813052A90\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ac5o9h830oz81.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=fddc1e8cd8cee3330de1d39727b2ddc8220bf75d",
