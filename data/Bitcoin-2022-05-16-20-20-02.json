Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, these used to be deductible as a loss. \n\n[EDIT: they were not actually, not if it was the result of your own negligence or willful act. The rest of this is irrelevant now anyway. They are still also clearly not deductible in this manner today anyway.]   \n\n~~However, since the tax reform, the only way a casualty loss could be tax deductible is if it's a federally declared disaster - which isn't likely to ever affect your crypto!~~\n\n~~So if you've lost your private keys, sent your crypto to the wrong address or otherwise lost your crypto due to negligence, you cannot deduct this as a capital loss.~~\n\n~~(Since the tax reform the answer is the same for theft losses as well. If you've been scammed or had crypto stolen, no deduction for you.)~~\n\n[*EDIT: So they are not deductible as a casualty or theft loss, but they are not a typical capital loss either. You didn't lose money because you sold the asset when the market went down. The market price of the asset did not drop to zero. The crypto is still worth what it's worth, you just don't own it anymore due to your own negligence. I will maintain that this is not a deductible capital loss.]",

A casualty loss is different than what he thinks.\n\n\u201cA casualty loss can result from the damage, destruction, or loss of your property from any sudden, unexpected, or unusual event such as a flood, hurricane, tornado, fire, earthquake, or volcanic eruption. A casualty doesn't include normal wear and tear or progressive deterioration.\n\nThere are three types of casualty losses, federal casualty losses, disaster losses and qualified disaster losses. All three types of losses are referred to as federally declared disasters, but the requirements for each loss vary.\u201d\n\nThis is not the same thing as what the OP is asking.  If you lose access to your investment then it\u2019s as if your investment went to zero.  It does not qualify as theft or casualty losses.",

Hence, it's not deductible.\n\nThose definitions were different prior to the tax reform. However I just went to the trouble to dig out the instructions for IRS Form 4684 and IRS Publication 547 from tax year 2017.\n\nI had thought according to the definition at that time, this would be a casualty loss. And maybe it would have, but digging into pub 547 it defines certain non-deductible casualty losses if they were the result of your own negligence or willful conduct. So they were not deductible then, either.\n\n> If you lose access to your investment then it\u2019s as if your investment went to zero. It does not qualify as theft or casualty losses.\n\nI disagree, insofar as you can't deduct the loss as a typical capital loss. This wasn't the result of the market, it's your own negligence. The crypto is still worth what it's worth, you just don't own it anymore.",

If the people using the network are bad.  \n\n\nI thought about these two points and tried to analyze the situation of bitcoin. In its early years, obviously very few people knew about it and people didn't want to invest in it. But the people on the dark web were using it. They were mining bitcoins since its early days, so if they were bad , which I'm sure they were, the second point comes into the picture. Also Since they were mining bitcoin from its beginning, it is possible that they could constitute the majority of nodes.   \nBitcoin became popular after the Silkroad was established in 2011 There were millions of transactions which tool place over the dark web via bitcoin.   \n\n\nI'm just curious if the bitcoin network is in good nodes or not.",

I see this playing out similarly to the ban on bullion in the 20th century. Thanks in advance.",
