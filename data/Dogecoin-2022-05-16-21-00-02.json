You will not be a part of any gains. \n\nIt only takes one mistake on your part to miss out. Meanwhile, buying a dip to increase the number of coins to sell that number of coins on the next peak will never affect your initial coin-count and still allow you to make money off swings.\n\nIf they work out, you can make money on both situations.
