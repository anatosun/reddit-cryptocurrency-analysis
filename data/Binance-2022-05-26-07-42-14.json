Since I m in Europe I can\u2019t do any SEPA transfers on Binance. \nSo if I understood correctly one good solution is to do SEPA on Coinbase pro, buy XLM, send it to Binance and then trade it (XLM/BTC\u2026) ? \nWhat about the trading fees XLM/EUR ? \nAnd lastly to withdraw to bank account it\u2019s the exact same steps but in reverse is that correct ? \nThanks for the help !",

However don't trade against the EUR in Binance, use BUSD for the lower fee trading and better range of trading pairs as well as more volume.",
