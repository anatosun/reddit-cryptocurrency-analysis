I'd love to hear your story and your experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently, I'm just getting myself familiarised with the crypto world. Of course, I've heard about it earlier. But, I never got deep into details about how all those crypto chains work and, most importantly, how people make money on them. As for me, it seemed impossible to make money on cryptocurrencies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, the world has become obsessed with cryptos. It's become so popular and readily available that even students talk about which cryptocurrency it's worth investing in. So, I'm also trying to follow this trend. I signed up for some free courses to learn more about how the world of cryptos operates. I hope to receive some general knowledge about it at the course and then look for my particular pathway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStill, I'm thinking of going into trending. I heard that mining is not that profitable right now. So, it's better to convert some of your savings into cryptos and try your best to multiply them through trading. Of course, it sounds easy on words. But in reality, I need to cover a lot of studying the theory in the first place. Then, I need to practice trading techniques that would allow me to trade and keep my full-time job simultaneously. Any trading technique takes time to practice and master.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm also interested in [crypto faucets](https://cryptofaucets.site). I recently ran into some info about them. I wonder if any of you have tried it already? Is it really possible to earn some crypto by completing various tasks? Is it a brand new way to earn cryptos instead of trading and mining? Do you think one can make a lot of money using this method?",

No investment required, it's legit.\n\n\\+/u/sodogetip 1 doge verify",
