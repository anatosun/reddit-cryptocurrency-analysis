For example, TFM being the only aggregated DEX on the chain prior to the crash and was on the verge of launching an NFT aggregator. Although, they have announced that they are going multi-chain as well as other projects built on the ecosystem. Will you consider it reasonable for these projects to extend their utility on the new chain or stick with the multi-chain focus?",
