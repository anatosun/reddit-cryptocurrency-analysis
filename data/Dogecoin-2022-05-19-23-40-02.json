Doge and shibe are tied to the same line. They both rise and fall together about the same. So then if you turn your brain on you see shibe is much cheaper than doge. Therefore if larger hikes on green days come you will profit exponetially more with shibe because of leverage. I have 8 mill shares in shibe and that will do me much more than the same amount of dollars in doge. \nMay our portfolios be green!!",
