Exchanges don't have a business without all the shitcoin staking, validators, endless trading fees, backdoor deals, and stablecoin grease. Bitcoin is open source hell for exchanges, because over time, the technology surrounding bitcoin trends towards its cost of production as information--which is close to zero. We now have an overabundance of free non-custodial wallets, multisig, the LN, node software, free e-commerce platforms like BTCPayserver. We're now getting LN debit cards (NFC) all over like Bolt Card and Satscard, etc. This doesn't help exchanges and their partners, because it's a race to zero. Mining will eventually do the same with energy imo.",

Bitcoin isn't particularly profitable for them by comparison. I'd suggest you read Coinbase's 10-k's. This is partly why many refuse to integrate the LN, it erodes their BTC margins FURTHER. Then there's the issue of regulation. Most shitcoins will be designated securities (SEC chair just met with FTC on Wed and said just that), and reiterated BTC is NOT a security. They're meeting with exchanges already and preparing them. So like I said, there is bitcoin, then there is crypto. One is a scam going to effectively zero, the other is separating money from State.",
