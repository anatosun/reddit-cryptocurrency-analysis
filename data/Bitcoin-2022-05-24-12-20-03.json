I\u2019m asking for peoples opinions if it\u2019s a good idea to do what I\u2019m doing. I understand the fundamentals and systems behind Bitcoin, but I\u2019m still learning.\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t probably the type of post you see everyday, but I just wanted to ask others opinions on my idea.\n\nI already know how private/public keys work, (I use SSH and PGP keys) and I know pretty much all about the fundamentals of how bitcoin works. I also have 3 hardware wallets, two ledgers (S plus and X) and a Trezor model T. (Don\u2019t ask why I have so many)\n\nI\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m going to start stacking my coins in BTC, and save them for my future. I\u2019m also wondering what other people\u2019s thoughts are on this, personally I think it\u2019s a great idea.\n\nPS: Scammers, don\u2019t DM me, you just make yourself look like a dumbass and entertain me in the meantime.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the awards!",

It\u2019s an incredibly smart move to start saving at such a young age. \n\nHonestly, the best thing you can do is diversify and compound. \n\nI\u2019m personally way into crypto, both BTC and alts. But to really diversify, you should be investing in other asset classes. Many apps/systems out there to make ease of this. Things such as fractional realty, mutual funds, ETFs, etc. \n\nI have a recommendation that would require your parents\u2019 help, but it\u2019s something I do for both my kids. A UTMA/UGMA account. Do a little reading on those. There is a mobile app/banking/investing platform that offers these and is super easy to use. And they\u2019ll reinvest your earning which really adds value over long time periods by compounding your returns. Its called Acorns and is, unfortunately only available in the US. There are other similar platforms available in other regions, but I\u2019m not recalling their names. \n\nI promise this isn\u2019t a shill. Just a suggestion. \n\nKeep thinking and planning for the long term and your life will be everything you want it to be one day.",

Even if you can just put $10 or something a week into your investing, directing some right away into a basic index fund each time will go a long way before you are even an adult. I knew quite a bit about investing at your age, but it was much harder to start out with small increments in the early 90s...commissions and fees were so much more, and the barrier to entry was just so much higher. Like having to put in a few thousand just to open a bare bones brokerage acct with someone like Schwab. So I didn't get started when it would have done the most good.\n\nAnyway, good luck, keep educating yourself, diversify, and don't freak out about the little dips and peaks (good or bad). Keep the big picture in mind, and remember that dips in the market is like your favorite store having a big sale...you get to buy more! As long as you are in more than one asset or class (as in, not just Apple stock or whatever...almost all things come to an end), you'll come out ahead. Dollar cost averaging is everything over time.\n\nAlso use this time to learn about/play with budgeting and what is sometimes called \"paying yourself first.\" Whether at your age and the next few years, you have odd jobs, a steady job, or just random windfalls like holiday $$ gifts...pick a percentage and always put that amount or more right into savings/investment, so you get used to that and don't miss it. :) It makes the mindset so much easier by the time you have to seriously consider things like taxes.",

If you do that before you even create your wallet, you can avoid sharing your public key with anyone, to keep your wallet more private. You can even play with lightning a bit but you likely won't profit from that so keep expectations low. Running a node however is an easy and fun way to contribute to the network and improve your own opsec. And Umbrel has a ton of add-on apps for various features and functionality (like your own personal [mempool.space](https://mempool.space) ).",

That being said, I'm not sure that it's the right time to have risky assets in your portfolio at this time in general, I personally sold all crypto and might buy back in a few months if the space gets rid of most useless projects. If you are interested in the technical aspects there is a lot to get to know, bitcoin is just the beginning, there are much cooler things like zk proofs etc., just don't get lost in it and remember to live your life/have fun with friends along the way)",

I quickly spent it and was fascinated by how there was no account needed, just downloading electrum and receiving money just through a bunch of random letters that meant nothing to be at the time. I had no clue how bitcoin worked at all.\n\nFast forward a few months, I couldn\u2019t buy bitcoin anymore, as KYC was required everywhere, and I live in the USA so it\u2019s pretty much impossible without it. It sucked, so I dropped bitcoin for a year.\n\nThen I came back to it, with more knowledge of how it worked, and I asked my parents if they could make a coinbase account for me. They said yes, I was so thrilled. Then I sent some to electrum and I just checked it every now and then, and I think I even bought something with it (can\u2019t remember at the top of my head)\n\nEventually I did more research into how btc worked, and I found out about public and private keys. I had no clue what they were, but after using PGP keys I realized how similar it was to bitcoin, just like signing a message with a private key, except now you\u2019re signing money to be sent with your private key.\n\nI learned how a key is derived from the 12-24 words, and then I learned about how blocks are mined and what they actually mean.\n\nI\u2019m still learning a lot, but my best advice to convince someone to become a bitcoiner is to give them some bitcoin to start out with, and explain to them what it is. Chances are, people are curious and will try and research it on their own, and realize the potential btc has.",

Bitcoin will \"fail\" and you won't get much out of it, but you are young and getting started at a good age, losing some money and effort at your age isn't going to be the end of the world.  Alternatively Bitcoin will succeed and who knows how that will pan out for you, part of it may be how long you manage to hold onto it.  It will be tempting if it will pay for college, your first car, your first house, alternatively it could mean early retirement.    \n\n\nYou've taken your first step, now consider how tempting it might be if in a few years your holdings are enough to buy yourself a new car at 16, pay for college after graduation, or later buy your first house.  How long are you going to hold it for?  If you don't make a plan now, you'll likely just buy a really nice vehicle at 16 and later look back wondering why you wasted your stash on such a thing as it would have let you retire early.    Were I you I'd suggest you formulate some plan that allows you to reap some benefit along the way, maybe you don't buy a new 70k muscle car at 16 and just spend a portion on a more sensible vehicle. Maybe you see college as a worthy investment and are willing to spend 75% of your stash toward it.  Plan now, because the day you realize \"I could use all of my stash for X\" it's going to be very tempting.  The longer you hold it the bigger the payout is likely to be.",

That's why you diversify-- because you know you'll be wrong many times but you don't need to be right all the time if you're right many times.\n\nBTC is great, and in twenty years you may laugh that you'd be 10x richer if you put it all on a single asset, but if you're wrong, you'll regret not spreading out.\n\nIf you start when you're 14, you'll have lots of wins and losses by the time you're 20, and if you diversify, your losses will likely be overshadowed greatly by your wins.",

There are stunning works of art not just an par with the \"old master's\" of the Renaissance, but literally *surpassing* them.

I was referring to how the limited government led to significant economic growth, innovation, and opportunity.\n\nIDK exactly what you mean by patent medicine or if that existed in early America. If you're referring to the high cost of modern pharmaceuticals in America, that's largely due to government regulations that forbid us from importing medicine. A lot of drugs are developed here (with the help of taxpayer money), sold cheaper internationally, and sold for more here bc they can and don't have to compete with their own international prices. The USA basically subsidizes drugs for the rest of the world. Medicine in America is far from a free market, if that's what you're getting after. I would also argue that patents are a somewhat debated topic in libertarianism.\n\nEdit: formatting",

Does that not make gold superior?\n\nThe problem is that gold is in simply too short supply to use for everyday trades. People must then resort to representative money, such as paper currency. \n\nThe very reason that the precursor to the modern banking cartels pushed a gold standard was precisely to demonetize silver via government; because silver was a competitor they could not defeat in market competition. And once silver was removed, and gold never actually used, they could freely counterfeit.\n\nIn theory, nations who's people used a silver standard, (philipines, qing, moghul) were on a strong sound money foundation. Sadly, sound money alone was not enough to defeat the other weaknesses of those empires; leaving them with an insufficient technological and economic base to compete. \n\nIn particular, the Qing empire was based on slavery and wealth was directly proportional to position in government, leading to government attempting to control all aspects of life. Much like modern china, this causes government to attempt to snuff out any disruptions, such as new technology. Much like modern china mostly killing off its nascent tech sector, the Qing empire quashed science, international trade, and did not allow the working capitalist class to retain enough of their wealth to incentivize innovation. \n\nIts likely that the banking cartel empires will follow this same trajectory when their captialist momentum runs low... unless bitcoin is able to disrupt legacy banking.",
