The stock market is going under as well, it's much more than old meme-lord Elon drinking wine and twittering.   \n\n\nIt's hedgefunds going broke, and liquidating their assets. Don't believe institutions own crypto? Look at Paypal, from what I've heard recently they are purchasing 70% of the worldwide sells from mining. A lot of companies, just like tesla have bought bitcoin, some rightly are quiet about it. There's one wallet I seen that has billions of dollars, started about 2019, that's no retailer. That wallet coincidentally liquidates around the same areas where the \"memestocks\", amc, gme, bb, nok, express, koss and I think some others, gets swinging.   \n\n\nand when a large whales dump millions, almost billions of dollars, the price tanks. When btc tanks, the rest of the market goes down as well.   \n\n\nElon might have something to do with something, because that guy pops up everywhere, but nah, this isn't crypto investors withdrawing their pocket change. I find nothing but bullish crypto investors that are burned.",

Nothing compared to me having 20k in AMC at 33 but that's how it goes. Yesterday I saw the premarket and had major FOMO and bought in at 62.50 then the CEO sold shares and the price tanked. I want to better my position and believe this stock is going to go up and down. I'd like to sell if it gets to my price and looks to be going down and buy back in at a lower price. Any ideas?

Well, that's awesome news!   \n\n\nOfc I was interested in this announcement so soon after I found out that this collection has some unique NFT avatars with various accessories. Including different facial traits and backdrops. Each NFT is worth 7 BNX. This might be interesting cause NFTs give holders different rights and privileges on platforms, but it's based on their credit ratings.   \n\n\nDoes anyone know what that means, about the different rights and privileges that these NFTs would provide?   \n\n\nIt's interesting that this time I didn't find out about the NFT collection via Ludo or other searching engines as I usually do, but anyway, I'm so glad I find out about this one.  \n\n\nMaybe the ones who didn't know would find this information interesting, BinaryX powers is a famous P2E game on BSC, CyberDragon, and CyberArena. Players can earn daily revenue and rewards while still having fun in the game.   \n\n\nSo, what do you think of this NFT collection?",
