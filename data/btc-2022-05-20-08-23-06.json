Once they see how easy it is to use, and that it helps protect against inflation, (because the word, \u201crecession,\u201d has been coming up lately), they will be happy to be a part of the BCH community!!\n\nSpecial Note:\n\nThere is an upcoming BCH Conference in St. Maarten, in November 2022, (in person event), and I am very much looking forward to being there!!",

That means, essentially, BCH is 0s!\n\nAttempts to defraud can be detected via Double Spend Proofs . Perfect for retail.\n\nFor larger purchases, one can wait for a confirmation before releasing the goods, but if more speed is required, it would be possible on the BCH network to do something called 'Zero Conf Escrow' which would protect the seller from a successful double spend by making the buyer put up an extra amount in escrow which the seller could claim if the purchase transaction is fraudulently double spent.",
