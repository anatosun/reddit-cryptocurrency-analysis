Once they see how easy it is to use, and that it helps protect against inflation, (because the word, \u201crecession,\u201d has been coming up lately), they will be happy to be a part of the BCH community!!\n\nSpecial Note:\n\nThere is an upcoming BCH Conference in St. Maarten, in November 2022, (in person event), and I am very much looking forward to being there!!",
