                                                    "response": "A 'node' is just a program that keeps track of Ethereum's history, storing every single block that was mined with all their transactions. In the very early days of Ethereum all users had to run their own node in order to send ETH or interact with smart contracts, but then services came along that would run a node on behalf of the users, like MyEtherWallet or Metamask. Running a node yourself is annoying because it must be kept up-to-date and it takes a large amount of disk space and is only really suited for people with SSD. \n\nMiners for instance must always know when a new block was found and which is the canonical chain, so they are required to run a node in order to find new blocks (although I don't know if miners in pools are actually required to do so or just delegate their hash power, but the pool operators are running the node then). Companies that provide services or data for dapps will also be running nodes.\n\nBy running a node yourself as a user, you're personally verifying the correctness of the state of the blockchain, but by using services like Metamask or MyEtherWallet, you're trusting that those companies provide you with the correct history.\n\nPersonally I think the biggest issue with hosting nodes on AWS is that it could freeze some dapps if they are relying on getting info from a node hosted on AWS and AWS goes down or if Amazon decides to censor them. Say for instance Metamask was hosting their node on AWS and Amazon blocked them, then you'd basically be unable to send/receive or interact with a smart contract via Metamask which would have a huge impact on many users and in turn would make a lot of dapps a lot less convenient to use. \n\nSo the decentralized alternative is basically that all dapp operators or service providers run their own node, at least as a backup.",

But you won't get a lot of specific details anywhere yet as currently vendors like OVH and SAP are applying for various parts. It's a huge initiative funded by the EU. We're talking 3-5 year long project timescales here though and it's fairly early days.\n\nI guess it's similar to GAIA-X, but gaia goes much more into standardisation whereas these projects are about building the actual thing. The hope is that by 2025 EU nation states will be able to start using the basic IaaS services and soon after mandates can come through that specify what kinds of workloads or data can run on AWS/Azure and what must be run on EU sponsored infrastructure. \n\nIt's a really exciting project to work on, although it's a bit awkward being a Brit myself.",

I've only seen a few do it, and have only recently started doing it myself.\n\nThe reasoning behind it is: After the merge there won't be an ETH1 and ETH2 anymore, just Ethereum. So the terms \"ETH1\" and ETH2\" will more or less be depreciated and replaced with \"Execution\" and \"Concensus\". So what we know today as ETH1 clients will be the execution clients (Geth, Nethermind, Parity) and what we know today as ETH2 clients will be the concensus clients (Prysm, Lighthouse, Teku, etc). \n\nI am not too familiarise with Blox staking but have done some reading up on it just now. From what I understand, it seems that Blox themselves host the nodes which the end users accesses via a service called Blox Infura, while the end user only runs the validator. If this is the case, then you will have no storage requirements, and your CPU, RAM and bandwidth requirements would be very minimal.\n\nThe trade-off here is you are relying on them to do the right thing. If you ran the nodes yourself you would be storing and verifying full copies of the database yourself, this would ensure extra decentralisation and extra security.",

You need state intervention. \nIf Amazon isn't leftist why did 77% of all political donations from Amazon go to democratic runners in the presidential election? \nSeems odd.",
