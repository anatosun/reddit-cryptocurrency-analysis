Is this **absolutely true** in all cases? If not, is there a single coin out there that has value even though virtually everyone has no faith in it?\n\nThis seems like it could be very exploitable to social engineering attacks by shorting the coin then shilling tons and tons of FUD against the coin and hope it enters a [death spiral](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rahulrai/2022/05/17/the-death-spiral-how-terras-algorithmic-stablecoin-came-crashing-down/).\n\n___\n\n**TL;DR:** Is \"faith in the coin\" the #1 thing which keeps 99.999% of coins alive and which prevents them from crashing to zero? \ud83e\udd14",

                    "response": "No.\n\nIt's math. Compounding rates specifically. \n\nBitcoin-like currencies have about a 1.5% annual issuance rate, the FED was increasing the M3 supply 24% annually for the last two years. Inflation will catch up with the dollar in a few years, and the price of coins will catch up when shorts have to cover or rollover their positions\u2014which could be soon.\n\nSince 2017, the US dollar has been diluted 58% in total. And with manipulation, if someone made $330M shorting 100,000 BCH in 2017, it would only take $18M to lock up all the coins they sold and prevent them from doing it again. We basically gain 30x leverage, in hard-currency, without leverage. And that $18M is getting cheaper by the day, like having $11M in 2017.\n\nFor most of the decent currencies, the manipulators are trying to keep the price below the 2017 ATH for two reasons, they want to invoke a death spiral narrative, and two, they don't want to have to recapitalize their initial short position. They can borrow as many coins as they can to short, but eventually that are going to be borrowing coins just to pay back borrowed coins.\n\nWe're moving real money from people who think they have it in a \"custodial\" app, into our own wallets for pennies on the dollar. And we're screaming at the people getting scammed to stop thinking for a moment that those were ever \"their coins\".\n\nDecentralized currencies don't die like companies, the dogecoin squeeze last year is proof of that, if you know what you saw. What hedge funds were doing to companies was appalling, but decentralized projects aren't like companies, they are designed to never stop, the main goal is resiliency against attacks and uptime. If someone is stupid enough to short a decentralized fixed-issuance currency to make a triangle in a hyper-inflationary fiat chart, they're too stupid to have access to sound money. \n\nThe exchanges that loaned ultra-hard currencies didn't know enough math to honor their fiduciary responsibilities.   \n\nThe collective sum of coins that everyone holds in apps like Robinhood, Square, Paypal, Venmo, Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini and Cashapp is exactly zero. We told everyone that again and again. \n\nIf the exchanges bankruptcy claims are denominated in the coins they lost, the amount owed in fiat will never go down.  The Mt Gox hack was $450M at the time, it's $25B today. No exchange that loans coins is going to survive in the long run and none of them will make customers whole.",

We need some things to complete our lives, grain meat, a jacket, or more generally we need food, clothes and shelter, each of which is value.

Yes you can save your gold for your family, and it can be used to fill teeth in 200 years. But the value of that is questionable, because you will have to take time into account. You need to reduce the future value of some percentage, for example you can discount it by 3% per year, which could be the average real interest rate. After 200 years it will be 4 dollars left from the current 1800 dollars for an ounce. So obviously, it would be smarter to delay the extraction of that gold to some time closer to its use, which we do with other metals like steel. On the other hand, the market has decided that gold is money, and that makes everything different. The value of gold is mostly monetary, which means that it is a general value that can be exchanged for other things with more specific, and directly useful, value.",

While a currency may have a range of stable equilibrium, there is always the possibility that something will take it beyond that range and lead to an inflationary or deflationary \"death spiral\". No currency is immune to this, but some are more susceptible than others.",
