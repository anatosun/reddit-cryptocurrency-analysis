                    "response": "OK guys, this is important I think.\n\nFor some reason it's not allowing me to have my own posts here, and the cryptocurrency sub-reddit won't allow me to post it. Here goes:\n\nThe other day I made a post about how imo I suspect Celsius are running a ponzi scheme with unsustainable business practices. Orginal post here:\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/updnmi/celsius\\_had\\_half\\_a\\_billion\\_on\\_anchor\\_protocol/\r  \n\r  \nI also posted my concerns in the Celsius sub-reddit and have been banned.\r  \n\r  \nAt the end of this post are links regarding what Celsius are doing and their shady past.\r  \n\r  \nCory Klippsten who was one of the first to expose the Anchor/Lunna ponzi before it went south:\r  \n\r  \nhttps://youtu.be/cSRrKD04lv4\r  \n\r  \nAlso has grave concerns about Celsius on his Twitter:\r  \n\r  \nhttps://twitter.com/coryklippsten/status/1525931922655891457\r  \n\r  \nI now have suspicions that two of the more respected Youtubers are shilling Celsius together.\r  \n\r  \nJames from Investanswers.\r  \n\r  \nHe is known to be a \"Not your keys, not your coins\" guy, and has made many videos regarding self custody.\r  \n\r  \nYet numerous times he has allowed Alex, Celsius CEO on his channel to basically give him free advertising.\r  \n\r  \nThis is odd. James says he doesn't leave his coin on exchanges and had gone as far as criticising Celsius's competitors Blockfi and Nexo.\r  \n\r  \nToday Alex shows up Digital Asset News. More \"free\" publicity.\r  \n\r  \nOnce a week Dan who presents Digital Asset News and James get together to do a show together (with Ben Cowen).\r  \n\r  \nOne more thing..I'm not sure if it's still there but Celsius web page had happy customer's faces in bubbles.\r  \n\r  \nOne of those faces is of Dan's. I doubt Dan is allowing his image due to the goodness of his heart.\r  \n\r  \nSo: We have two YouTube influences who know each other, one of which (James) says he doesn't accept sponsors. Both have links to Celsius. Alex is the only CEO of a cefi company James has had on his channel and he slags off the competition. James also shilled Luna.\r  \n\r  \nObviously this is what is suspect and I have no real proof, and am open to counter agruments.\r  \n\r  \nMore info:\r  \n\r  \nhttps://wantfi.com/celsius-network-review.html\r  \n\r  \nhttps://rorodi.substack.com/p/the-biggest-crypto-lending-company\r  \n\r  \nhttps://youtu.be/3RkW63YZdXc\r  \n\r  \nhttps://youtu.be/cBiJ\\_8DSnjQ\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz2pIo43Dm8&ab\\_channel=CryptoBeau\r  \n\r  \nhttps://coingeek.com/celsius-cfo-shalem-arrest-confirmed-in-israel-adding-to-customer-concerns/#:\\~:text=Founded%20in%202017%20by%20Mashinsky%20and%20Daniel%20Leon%2C,scheme.%20Company%20representatives%20have%20frequently%20denied%20this%20accusation.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CelsiusNetwork/comments/hlh008/robert\\_leshner\\_compound\\_founder\\_calling\\_celsius\\_a/\r  \n\r  \nhttps://protos.com/celsius-cfo-arrested-in-moshe-hogeg-crypto-fraud-money-laundering-case/",

So much of the growth of bitcoin has been predicated on the investment of countries like Nigeria, who might not have the opportunity to invest confidently in alternatives like stocks. If a company like Apple decided to ICO, wouldn\u2019t people in these countries be inclined to consider buying Applecoin instead of Bitcoin given that Apple can produce a profit will bitcoin\u2019s value stays constant? I don\u2019t think this would kill BTC by any means, but I could see it leading back to the old Store of Value v S&P argument that has gone on for years that may limit BTC\u2019s upside long-term.",
