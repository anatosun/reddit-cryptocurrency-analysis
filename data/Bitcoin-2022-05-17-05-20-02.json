I don\u2019t think this would kill BTC by any means, but I could see it leading back to the old Store of Value v S&P argument that has gone on for years that may limit BTC\u2019s upside long-term.",

There's no competition because there cannot exist another decentralized protocol with its immaculate conception and its global liquidity. If the government bans it, it keeps working (China is 20% of the hash rate after it banned mining) and will outlast stupid laws and governments. It's the ultimate risk off asset.

All of these huge monopolies have been artificially created using cheap government credit to become bigger than any monopoly could in a true free market. Losing the cheap credit due to QT, is to slowly lose that advantage to absorb resources from borrowed credit. And when the technology shifts in another direction they will have a harder time reworking their massive infrastructure to accommodate as opposed to a smaller start up. It\u2019s what happens to most big business eventually as many don\u2019t want to pay the cost to change their product.(Sears, Blockbuster) I loved Apple since my first 3gs, but Bitcoin offers far more value over the next 20 years. \n\nTLDR. All your favorite S and P Athletes are being pulled of the juice. They are now so swoll they can\u2019t wipe their own ass and aren\u2019t going to perform(grow) like they did in the past. Not Bitcoins problem as it\u2019s in a whole other league.",

Here goes:\n\nThe other day I made a post about how imo I suspect Celsius are running a ponzi scheme with unsustainable business practices. Orginal post here:\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/updnmi/celsius\\_had\\_half\\_a\\_billion\\_on\\_anchor\\_protocol/\r  \n\r  \nI also posted my concerns in the Celsius sub-reddit and have been banned.\r  \n\r  \nAt the end of this post are links regarding what Celsius are doing and their shady past.\r  \n\r  \nCory Klippsten who was one of the first to expose the Anchor/Lunna ponzi before it went south:\r  \n\r  \nhttps://youtu.be/cSRrKD04lv4\r  \n\r  \nAlso has grave concerns about Celsius on his Twitter:\r  \n\r  \nhttps://twitter.com/coryklippsten/status/1525931922655891457\r  \n\r  \nI now have suspicions that two of the more respected Youtubers are shilling Celsius together.\r  \n\r  \nJames from Investanswers.\r  \n\r  \nHe is known to be a \"Not your keys, not your coins\" guy, and has made many videos regarding self custody.\r  \n\r  \nYet numerous times he has allowed Alex, Celsius CEO on his channel to basically give him free advertising.\r  \n\r  \nThis is odd. James says he doesn't leave his coin on exchanges and had gone as far as criticising Celsius's competitors Blockfi and Nexo.\r  \n\r  \nToday Alex shows up Digital Asset News. More \"free\" publicity.\r  \n\r  \nOnce a week Dan who presents Digital Asset News and James get together to do a show together (with Ben Cowen).\r  \n\r  \nOne more thing..I'm not sure if it's still there but Celsius web page had happy customer's faces in bubbles.\r  \n\r  \nOne of those faces is of Dan's. I doubt Dan is allowing his image due to the goodness of his heart.\r  \n\r  \nSo: We have two YouTube influences who know each other, one of which (James) says he doesn't accept sponsors. Both have links to Celsius. Alex is the only CEO of a cefi company James has had on his channel and he slags off the competition. James also shilled Luna.\r  \n\r  \nObviously this is what is suspect and I have no real proof, and am open to counter agruments.\r  \n\r  \nMore info:\r  \n\r  \nhttps://wantfi.com/celsius-network-review.html\r  \n\r  \nhttps://rorodi.substack.com/p/the-biggest-crypto-lending-company\r  \n\r  \nhttps://youtu.be/3RkW63YZdXc\r  \n\r  \nhttps://youtu.be/cBiJ\\_8DSnjQ\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz2pIo43Dm8&ab\\_channel=CryptoBeau\r  \n\r  \nhttps://coingeek.com/celsius-cfo-shalem-arrest-confirmed-in-israel-adding-to-customer-concerns/#:\\~:text=Founded%20in%202017%20by%20Mashinsky%20and%20Daniel%20Leon%2C,scheme.%20Company%20representatives%20have%20frequently%20denied%20this%20accusation.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CelsiusNetwork/comments/hlh008/robert\\_leshner\\_compound\\_founder\\_calling\\_celsius\\_a/\r  \n\r  \nhttps://protos.com/celsius-cfo-arrested-in-moshe-hogeg-crypto-fraud-money-laundering-case/",
