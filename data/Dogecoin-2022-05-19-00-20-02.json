Since China banned mining on scale with no free or semi  free electricity.  BTC which everything is tied to ( to a certain extent).

To mine one BTC cost in equipment and electricity about 35,000 to 40,000 for 1\u2026 most in circulation were mined well below that level. There are probably only about 15 million BTC in circulation as estimated 20% are lost forever. As BTC advances so will the whole market. The amount of BTC will dry up substantially in 5 years as big early rejectors are now buying. The whole market will move",
