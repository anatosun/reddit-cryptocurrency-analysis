A little macabre having the whitepaper splattered in blood.\n\nThe intro does into the history of how private money money was suppressed. Starting at 15:20 it starts to get into who organized the conspiracy against Bitcoin. \n\n**At 18:00 the narrator calls the Bilderberg group \"the core of globalism\", which may be a dogwhistle. They specifically mention [that] the Bilderberg group mentions \"Biodiversity, Climate Change, and the threat of cyber attack. At 18:10 a screen shot of the Bilderberg website is shown with a link to an article entitled \"Axa Future Risks Report 2021: Climate Change cyber risk top the list of concerns\".  Voice over: \"Are mentioned more and more frequently.\" At 18:15 is a video still showing a cover slide entitled \"Insurance 2040: Rethinking risk in the age of climate change.\" Subtitle: \"The AXA 2021 Foresight Report Launch.\"**\n\nThey then mention the World Bank, the Mit Media Lab. At 19:03 they mention that the Mit Media Lab was funded by Jerry Epstein, which may be another dogwhistle in this context. Then they mention Digital Currency group was funded by both Blockstream, and Master Card (among others). They specifically mention Master Card's interest in KYC compliance.\n\nAt 20:30 the start going into some of the directors of the Digital Currency Group. They describe Glenn Hutchins as:\n\n* Executive Committee of the Obama foundation\n* Board Member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\n* Former Clinton Official\n\nLawrence Summers is described as:\n\n* Secretary of the Treasury during Clinton\n* Director of the National Economic Counil for Obama\n\nIt is weird that they mention positions held when Democrats were in office, but not when George Bush (a Republican) was in office. Possibly another dogwhistle.\n\n**At 38:15 It claims the state is manufacturing crisis [to solve] and flashed a picture of somebody getting a nose swab.**\n\nSo I think a re-edit is possible, but it definitely appears to contain some antisemitic dogwhistles that would be clearly understood by the alt-right.\n\n\nWhat I was talking about [were] two short scenes (bolded above since I flagged potential \"dogwhistles\").",
