Has anyone here applied or interviewed with Coinbase before and are willing to share your experience with the process?\n\nA friend of mine works for Robinhood, and he described their hiring process as a nightmare. I know it\u2019s a different company and stuff, but it\u2019s definitely got me curious.\n\nFor a bit on context, I am not applying for a technical role. I have experience with SQL, but beyond that I\u2019m not really a coder. There\u2019s a few operations and analyst type roles I\u2019m interested in.\n\nThanks in advance",

It's already being replaced by automation but if you know some it will be easy for you to hone it and that's a value add for any team sick of waiting on the data science department. \n\nAlso, learn python. If not for your desired role then learn it for the time it will save you. If you have a decent grasp on sql and Python and data in general you will do alright applying for entry level roles in those departments but you'll have a much easier time getting into the business and operations departments. \n\n\nGood luck!",
