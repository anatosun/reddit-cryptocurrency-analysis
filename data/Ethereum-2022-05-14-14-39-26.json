His ETH was stored on a Ledger. But instead of sending the ETH to Binance and selling it for BUSD, for some reason (probably out of convenience) he used a company that Ledger partners with called [Changelly.com](https://Changelly.com). Sent the ETH to them, expecting them to send back BUSD. Only they didn't send the BUSD and instead just kept his ETH, giving him bullshit excuses about the transaction being processed.\n\nCompanies like these have sprung up for \"convenience\" to save people from having to interact with centralized exchanges and the KYC that comes with that. But Changelly has been shit for a long time. I remember there was a huge controversy with them holding up Monero withdrawals for weeks back in 2018, likely due to them selling Monero they didn't actually own. And by the time they actually sent you the Monero you bought, the price had changed significantly (in their favor).",

A very plausible scenario IF that were to happen would be they file with the courts. A judge puts a freeze on all their assets and gets who gets paid first? All their creditors, anything left is then divvied up how the courts and the attorneys see fit. Bankruptcy is never about making the end users whole, it's about selling off the bankrupt companies assets to maximize paying back their creditors. Now I'm not an attorney, but at a high level this typically how bankruptcy works in the US. The courts don't care if it's yours or not. I have no reason to think this is how things will play out, but this is why people say get your stuff out of there. It's no different than a bank going under, though in this case the US Federal government (FDIC) guarantees protection for something like $100K per account.",

It's a robust and decentralized network of nodes with miners currently transferring into a different field of work, whilst validators will continue to function under a different ruleset. \n\nregardless, I understand the fear, but I wouldn't be taking these things and negotiating their probabilities as comparable in situations like this. Ethereum is more or less going to just upgrade and eventually have the chain merge, go to PoS, eventually get sharding, and that'll just take time. \n\nTerra Luna, Enron, and even Tulip Mania, are all different things and not even in the same ballpark of Ethereum2.0 and stake unlocking.\n\nThe issue here is more the question of Coinbase being in trouble and let me just say - since its inception - it has experienced drawbacks FAR more than 50% lol. \n\nIn 2017 Ethereum's chart looked like LUNA's. Ethereum was pretty much down like \\~94% and everything was done. \n\nOr so we thought.\n\nI wouldn't be too pessimistic. Shit sucks right now, but Coinbase is well aware of these events and has survived through them and they're not \"cocky\" or arrogant persay. I think they plan for these things and are in it for the long haul considering the underlying assets their business relies on - rely on eventual price appreciation (key word here being \"eventual\") to generate volume from trading - the good & the bad.\n\ntldr; don't worry lol.",

If I voted on a chain that looked correct, but eventually got abandoned, I should be able to correct my mistake and come back to the real chain (without being slashed or divested).\n\nSo how does the proposed PoS solution solve that conundrum?\n\nI understand that validators can't vote for two blocks at the same height. But, can they vote at different heights in different chains? Could the validator alternate its votes between the two chains? For example, when the height is even, it votes in fork A, when the height is odd, it votes for B. The the validator would be \"active\" in both chains.\n\nObviously, validators can't be active in two chains because forks would proliferate! How is this solved?",

Now I want to start developing in web3 but can't decide between Sol and Eth.  \nI already played around a little bit with Solidity(eth), but I don't see where could I go once I have a portfolio of apps?  \nThe thing is I am very familiar with Solana space since me and my friends have been frying here for more than 6 months and it seems pretty easy to find clients to develop apps for a couple of $SOL.\n\n1)Is this even a possibility on eth? If so, what discords or twitters should I follow to find those?   \n2) It seems like there are too many updates with SOL and all the courses are outdated already. Do you guys think it's a long-term good idea to study Sol-Development? I'm not a trader so I have no idea and Eth already survived two bear markets",

This is different than Ethereum's scalability issues where fees get out of hand but the chain stays online.\n\nThe last time they went down it was because an NFT game was generating more transactions than they could handle, crashing the nodes. When they were trying to bring the chain back up the devs entertained the idea of censoring transactions, saying that they'd rather have a functioning chain without NFTs if it came to it.\n\nA chain that is not able to stay up and has developers that do not value decentralization above all else does not, in my opinion, make for a good sales pitch for an L1 to build upon.\n\nAll that said, the Sol NFT ecosystem is vibrant, so you personally might find a lot of success as a developer there for now. Will Solana remain an appealing L1 in the long term? I don't know, but Ethereum does not have these issues, so IMO you have a better chance of long term prospects by digging into Ethereum development.",

However, most businesses don't have a cryptocurrency wallet yet and the latter defeats the purpose of DAOs where everything is democritized and there is no hierarchy in groups.\n\nSo my question is, is there a way to make real-life payments through a DAO while ensuring decentralization and transparency?\n\nMy knowledge about DAOs is not very extensive so I'm sorry for my ignorance.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Given, it's still somewhat centralized to who is the custodian of the account, but you kinda have to have someone holding the company credit card if you're doing something IRL. So in best practice, the DAO should have a few elected leaders so that if one is voted out then the others can do the administrative to take them off the bank account and stuff like that.",

Because if the sequencer goes down you can\u2019t necessarily get your funds back from a validium operator since all the data is off-chain. But you can get your funds back with ZK Rollups which means it offers better guarantees\u2026 \n\nFortunately for all of us, loopring offers ZK roll ups and already exists/runs today. They\u2019re soon to launch a new crypto market place with GameStop which will be accessible to 10m\u2019s of their existing customers plus an esports company and more products to come. \n\nClosing statement from Vitalik: Stay optimistic but long term, stay \u2018Zero Knowledge\u2019.

So I\u2019ve been wondering, in a much more decentralized system like Ethereum, how do different actors coordinate in a time of emergency? Let\u2019s say there\u2019s a malicious censorship attack on Ethereum by bad actors and immediate actions need to be taken, how would the validators (in the future), nodes, devs, and users coordinate without any central channel?

The rest really depends on the nature of the issue. If it's an urgent update to Geth or something, Geth will update their Github and send out an alert along their channels (Twitter). \n\nI don't really know how it would respond to a censorship attack because I'm not sure what such an attack would look like. Just filling up the blockspace is fine and ETH responds to it automatically by raising gas; it's not vulnerable to this like Solana is. Individual node operators have to respond to more direct DOS attacks themselves.\n\nPoS-based attacks can mostly be solved through automatic slashing, and in the doomsday scenario where a malicious actor has >2/3rds of the stake the community will need to decide what to do to fork away their stake; also done through regular communication channels.",

The initial address having made the same transactions to >100k addresses).\n\nI haven't (and wouldn't) interact with the contract, it's marked as such (phishing contract) on Etherscan but I'm curious as my public address has never been used anywhere or posted online anywhere outside of withdrawals from an exchange.\n\nI just wanted to confirm that I do not need to create a new ETH wallet as a result of this token right? I can presumably just ignore it, never interact with it, or the website and that's it, right? I intend on using this address for ETH, MATIC and other ERC-20 tokens and would rather be safe than sorry so thought to ask you helpful bunch.\n\nCheers!",
