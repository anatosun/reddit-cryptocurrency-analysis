Instead, to protect investors from being misled by security token advertisers, it is critical for such advertisers to disclose the amount they were paid, whether their purchase will directly result in the advertiser making money on the security token, and the number of security tokens they received. If prospective investors learn that an advertiser was compensated in the form of security tokens or other forms of compensation for their advertisement, they may or may not be hesitant to put their hard-earned money into such an investment.  Regardless of the decision they end up making, it is every investor's right to have the information necessary to make that decision in the first place.\u201d\n\nhttps://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A09029&term=0&Summary=Y&Text=Y",

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that have been on the market a while could be even exempt based on a grandfathered in date.\r  \nEssentially, there is so much fraud in the market that I'm supporting just a tiny bit of regulation to make sure people aren\"t engaging in fraud.\r  \nIt's fraudulent for these crypto influences to say, \" I just found the next big crypto based on my analysis\" when what's really happening is they are selling you their own token or being paid a large sum of money to say that. - Mattcwu\r \n\n\u201cIt is not enough for security token advertisers to state that their advertisement is in fact an advertisement to safeguard investors. Instead, to protect investors from being misled by security token advertisers, it is critical for such advertisers to disclose the amount they were paid, whether their purchase will directly result in the advertiser making money on the security token, and the number of security tokens they received. If prospective investors learn that an advertiser was compensated in the form of security tokens or other forms of compensation for their advertisement, they may or may not be hesitant to put their hard-earned money into such an investment. Regardless of the decision they end up making, it is every investor's right to have the information necessary to make that decision in the first place.\u201d - OP",
