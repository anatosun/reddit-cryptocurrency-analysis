            "selftext": "I think I will sell my doge because it moves more and more away from the original thing \"Do Only Good Everyday\".\nWhen I bought my first dogecoins I didn't do it because of profits but instead because I liked the community, the memes and the idea of \"the peoples coin\". When Elon started pushing it I of course saw this a good sign. Although I never was a real fan of him but I knew that he was a big inovator. However as the community around Dogecoin started to follow him more and more blindly the skepsis started. I know that Dogecoin has in theory nothing to do with Elon Musk. But since I see more and more people here adapting his views with out questioning then, I don't see how this fits in with the D O G E spirit of doge.",

How can the richest man be something else then establishment? After all he is just anti other-people-that-don't-make-me-rich. Sure he can do whatever he wants but if Billy and Greg and all the others are just promoting is worldview than the value of doge gets lost to me.",
