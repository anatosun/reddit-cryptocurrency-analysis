            "selftext": "In a decentralized market, the decision making in companies whether it\u2019s an investment or policies changing decision, will be done through voting by holders of a specific governance token. \n\n\nTraditional governance has a pyramid of power and those overseeing have control over what happens, which will make the rest of the community feel like they don\u2019t have a say, and means that investments don\u2019t truly reflect what the people want or their interests. \n\n\nBut blockchain is turning the tables through the rise of DAOs that are enabled by governance tokens, allowing token holders to build a real community and be heard within that community.\u00a0\n\n\nFor example, BIT holders vote on which project should BitDAO support next, what changes should be implemented in the future, while also having access to one of crypto\u2019s most diverse and liquid treasuries. \n\n\nSo if you compare traditional governance with decentralized governance, you\u2019ll have on one hand a project/company/organization with a community that\u2019s less engaged and that reflects the views of only a few interested and powerful parties, and on the other hand you\u2019ll have a project that\u2019s giving the power to the people.",
