I've been listening for a couple years now and it is the sole reason I got back into Ethereum in 2019.\n\nBankless is a good one tailored to newbies. My only gripe is that they give a little too much lip-service to the whole \"fiat is about to implode\" narrative. I wish they never mentioned the terms \"Austrian economics\", \"money printer\",  \"hyperinflation\", or \"asset price inflation\". They regularly talk about these terms and it comes across as nonsense for those of us who do not think that 2% annualized inflation is part of an evil conspiracy by a greedy cabal operating in the shadows. Honestly a great podcast other that that.",

I still can use this wallet to open the keystore files and make transactions with my Passphrase, but I cannot migrate them. Is there a easy way or do I have to create a new wallet adress and send my old ether to the new adress? btw. is my crypt a good wallet for storing cryptos \"cold\".\n\nI want to switch because the old wallet isn't supported by the devs anymore.",

Use a small test transaction first.\n\nFor funds to be stored \"cold\" it must be stored on a device not connected to the internet, *ever.* This is most often done with hardware wallets, such as Ledger or Trezor. I use Trezor and it works fine for me. It supports Ethereum completely, as well as Bitcoin natively.\n\nI'm not sure MyCrypto would count as cold storage, not sure about their products, or how you're using it. Of course, if its connected to the internet *ever* its not a cold wallet.",

You should write it down *on paper,* don't save it to any device.\n\nStore this paper somewhere safe, like a safe (ha), so its fireproof/theft resistant. Some people store these in a bank safety deposit box, which isn't a bad option.\n\nYou can do things like write down half of the key and keep it in your house, write down the other half and give it to your mom, etc.",
