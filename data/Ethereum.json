Letting people mass transfer money out of the system harms them when the value of their currency literally controls how many resources and arms they can aquire.

You want it to devalue a little bit over time, because it encourages people to spend money and invest, which in turn grows the economy. \n\nObviously you can't have hyper-inflation, but when the value of the Ukranian dollar drops further and further, becuase of people transferring it to crypto or other currnencies -- **that is going to encourage excess money printing**.\n\n> they'll save their central bank \n\nWhere do you think the majority of their citizens have their money?

Some of the applications it supports have the goal of \"be pure money\" and those should in turn focus on those goals.",

It's not only the fact that their system is inn danger but it's way easier to implement any financial instrument in a technology like Ethereum then in the old techs. You could implement something like a put/call with a few lines of code instead of having to hire a hundred c++ programmers who will integrated such stuff in a heavy old mammoth.\nOf course they are right - Ethereum is a much better tech then Bitcoin, you can do on Ethereum way more stuff.\nThe reason why we should listen what they have to say is because all others who don't trust crypto might trust those assholes, thus they have a strong influence on the public acceptance and usage of crypto.\nFor me it's enough to read the headline, besides that I'm with you to not waste to much time on listening what they have to say.

The 5 dollars a PoS system pays out are NOT \"backed\" by an equal cost in the real world, because the main entry barrier here is the staked capital.\n\nIt's called an opportunity cost. You've allocated resources, here ETH, into the staking used by the consensus. It's resources you could have invested elsewhere. Actual resources. The fact you can't touch it doesn't mean it's not an actual resource.\n\n>So, in short: BTC will in the long run either not be successful or kill us all. I am not making a jest.\n\nHm, you're keeping an assumption that is true nowadays but would be false way before it kills us all. You're assuming burning electricity doesn't increase electricity price. It's true when you're only burning a small quantity of it. But once you end up burning more, you end up in an equilibrium where increases in electricity costs reduce the hashing power required to reach an equilibrium between mining profitability and electricity consumed. Just like staking, it's a self-regulated system. Although it has very strong consequences on the availability of electricity for the rest of the market. Just like the relations between fuel, bio fuel and food prices. An increased demand in fuel drives demand in bio fuel which decreases food availability for other purposes and results in starvation here and there.\n\nSo, it would affect us pretty badly, but would also drive innovation in cheap electricity production and wouldn't be able to kill us anyway. It would certainly kill some of use, though, as increasing energy price increases prices through the whole market and drives people into below minimum sustenance.\n\nBesides, it assumes BTC prices can go higher and higher indefinitely. This is also capped, even more so since miners need more and more of an influx of resources to buy and burn all that electricity. The higher the price, the harder it will become to proportionately increase it, both because any increment of a percent would need even more funds and because maintenance costs increase.\n\nThis goes the same for PoS, except that it uses ETH as a resource and will definitely drive innovation in ETH usage and won't have any impact on electricity production and availability.",

People who ignore long term externalities don't give a shit about the environmental cost.  Between a combination of private purchases of old plants and governments in economically distressed areas placing short term gain over long term sustainability, the real equilibrium level you posit is far off because coal isn't being taken out of the grid because of cost(it's cheap and abundant) or lack of availability(there's a surplus of coal powered generation).  The only way to stop this before too much harm is done is for the federal government to act to disincentivize this use of coal.",

So the same force that is driving people to want to add utility to their BTC by moving it onto EVM compatible chains (for trading, defi, games, etc.) is forcing the holders into an unsafe situation.  This is also happening in an environment where proof of work is becoming a greater and greater liability for both social impact and centralization concerns (if you have to live on a volcano to mine it's literally not decentralized :) ).  I think all of this ultimately has to lead to BTC evolving:  The only question is whether this will happen from a position of strength while it's still on top or whether it will be a last-ditch effort to salvage stored value when the price starts to reflect people's preferences.",

I agree its quite the opposite, with PoS if a guy is 100x richer than you, he gets 100x more rewards. With PoW the guy who is 100x richer than you have the ability and social networking to buy more and cheaper rigs and to secure much cheaper electricity, so at the end he gets much more than 100x rewards.\n\nThis also hits decentralisation at a different angle by centralizing mining at big mining facilities at places with cheap electricity, and the effect of this was seen during the Xinjiang blackout when the Bitcoin network lost over 45% of its hash rate.\n\nAt that moment in time, all China needed to do to take over the Bitcoin network was to take control over the big chinese mining facilities and turn them against the network with impunity because there is no defense mechanism with PoW. With PoS unlike PoW, nobody knows where the validators are and you get slashed if you want to play dirty.\n\nWant to add also that after The Merge, even if there is sell the news event, circulating ETH will suffer a huge supply shock comparable to 2-3 Bitcoin halvenings at once and in the next few months the price will start rising quite fast till it reaches it's new equilibrium.\n\nI don't believe in the sell the news event thesis, quite the opposite, a successful merge will send shockwaves not only through the crypto world but outside aswell.\n\nPoS has a very strong environmental narrative and The Merge will reignite the retail investor interest in the Ethereum network.",

That is translated into less inflation (even deflation) so scarcity which could counteract the theoretical price bound you mentioned.\n\nSecond: the L2 proliferation means more L1 gas usage as L2 is ultimately settled on L1, so even with all the ecosystem in L2, the gas prices will be high, burning and burning eth to increase the scarcity\n\nAnd third, ethereum\u2019s value as income generation asset.

Supply is going down. So, more usage, higher price.\n\nAs it relates to validators and staking, the less validators that exist and, consequentially, the less Ether that is actively staked in validating, the higher the APYs for the validators will be. This causes more validators to join the pool. As more validators join the pool, that is less Ether that is in circulation, which *effectively* reduces supply. There's also less issuance *per validator* with a larger number of validators, this is important later.\n\nAnd while PoS does cost significantly less to validate transaction, the amount of reward to validators is also significantly less. Currently, we're seeing 5.4M Eth/year in issuance on block rewards, where this be reduced all the way down to 0.5M Eth/year [Ultrasound Money](https://ultrasound.money). Combined with EIP-1559, this will cause a net reduction in the total supply.\n\nThere's an interesting balancing game here actually. If usage of the Ethereum network goes up significantly, we'll see very high burn rate of the supply, which increases the value of Ether. Corresponding, we should see increase in staked Ether, looking for the now higher value of the APY rewards, which, inturn, reduces available supply of Ether more. If Ethereum usage drops again, smaller burn rate, the value of staked APY reduces, causing less stakes, and freeing up some supply of ether again.\n\nI think the Tokenomics are quite sound, personally.",

I'll try to lead you in the right direction on this:\n\nTo get current security you can ask: How much is needed to 51%?\n\nWith bitcoin you just calculate how many TH/s you need times your price per TH/s, factor in for how long you want to sustain your attack and your electricity cost for this.In the end that's just a dollar amount. Because of \"economies of scale\" you actually get cheaper price per TH/s the more you buy.\n\nSimilar for Ethereum on PoS you calculate how much eth you would need to spin up enough validators, markets probably would not have enough eth, and the more you buy the more expensive it's going to get so the market is making it exponentially more expensive (opposite of bitcoin).\n\nAfter attack on bitcoin you are left with a large amount of hardware, after attack on ethereum you are left with a large amount of valueless tokens.\n\nIn the end the communities of both chains will probably fork you out and start a chain from wherever people feel the fraudulent activity started, so I don't think these scenarios are realistically a problem.\n\n**It is much more important to look at the long-term security model:**\n\nBitcoin has the \"halving\" every four years, this halves bitcoins relative security budget (how much money bitcoin is spending on security). The idea was that fees would eventually take over and pay for security. This essentially means bitcoin security = fees paid on-chain. As you may know, bitcoin has not been great at earning fees..\n\nThis leaves bitcoin in a scary situation: somehow get people to pay fees (get demand for transactions) or stop the halvings and break the 21 million limit to continue to have a secure chain. Considering bitcoins social consensus seems to be \"don't change anything, keep 21 million\" this is simply not sustainable.\n\nEthereum on the other hand has no hard cap, this ensures ethereum will continue to have strong relative security. With eip1559 and the merge ethereum will end up being deflationary, good for the environment as well as having very strong sustainable relative security.",

(Think of the thousands of individual asic miners needed to control 51% of the hash power and good luck obtaining those plus footing the electricity bill) On the other hand, you have the issue of economys of scale applied to the BTC network where as it becomes more and more difficult to mine BTC, it also can become more expensive and the mining becomes more centralized over time due to increasing expenses.\n\nWith proof of stake, you have the advantage of much lower energy consumption, however you don't quite have the same wall of energy so to say also securing the network. On the other hand, you make it a lot easier for more people to get involved with staking and staking pools, allowing for great diversity of nodes. Additionally, since the footprint is a lot smaller, that can be an advantage in a situation where a node gets shutdown. There's less equipment needed and overall maintenance to get a node back up and running elsewhere.\n\nThose are some of my thoughts, I'm sure someone out there has some more points to expand on for comparisons and contrasts between the two",

But if you think adoption will increase and more utilities will be built on Ethereum, adoption will only go up. Bullish theses operate on the idea of induced demand: as more capacity is built, more users show up to use it. Already we've seen Ethereum's mainnet capacity be completely saturated for about 2 years at this point, so much so that the overflow traffic was enough to sustain scores of alt-L1s, sidechains, and nascent rollups.\n\n> If it's main utility is just as a store of value from a decentralized source isn't bitcoin a better bet?\n\nA SoV is far from its main utility, but I believe Ether under PoS (specifically staked Ether) will be a far superior store of value compared to Bitcoin for at least another 100 years, simply because your Bitcoin holdings will continuously be diluted by miners until the block subsidy runs out (if it ever does). \n\nhttps://mirror.xyz/dataalways.eth/fUBmnyI3Q3KLWzEO7VjQNZzwY_2aTB3AY_7mi99ax2g",

Dropping fees and increasing throughput brings more people into the ecosystem to use DeFi, trade NFTs and tokens, etc. All of that requires Ether and those users wouldn't be doing any of that if fees were high. Also worth noting is that users rarely if ever use 100% of their Ether for fees. So for every additional user you acquire, more ETH is bought and held than is burned on fees. \n\nThe other factor to consider is that gas is not the *only* use for Ether. It has become the base trading pair for nearly all tokens created on Ethereum, it's the only asset able to be used for staking, and it's highly valued as collateral for use in CeFi and DeFi. \n\nAt the end of the day, value is pretty much just a function of supply and demand. Ether is in high demand due to its utility re:gas, but it's also in high demand as collateral, for staking, and for general trading use. Combined with the severe reduction in supply coming with the merge, it paints an extremely bullish long-term picture IMO.",

                    "response": "The product of Ethereum is blockspace, not the coin. The coin is just the thing you need to use to buy the blockspace. The value proposition is secure, decentralized, credibly neutral blockspace to settle stuff on it. EIP-1559 automatically adjusts the price of the product based on demand. The blockspace is limited, the demand for it is not. Layer 2 and such helps scaling by using less blockspace for the same end result, but as we've seen with alt-L1s offering low fees, there is a LOT of demand for cheap DeFi stuff. It's not as simple as 1000x lower fees = 1000x less ETH burned. It's more like 1000x lower fees = 1000x more demand as people from cheap alt-L1s flock to equally cheap but more secure/sustainable rollups. Demand is elastic: Lowering the cost means increasing the volume. And the thesis is that in the coming years/decades, the demand will be global and practically infinite and it will be accomodated by rollups batching everything super efficiently and paying a shit ton of gas on Layer 1.\n\nSo yeah, demand for secure blockspace is abundant. The more demand there is for blockspace, the more Ether they pay, which burns Ether and rewards stakers, which adds economic security to the network, which adds to the value proposition mentioned (secure blockspace). \n\nIn addition to that, Ether powers the whole ecosystem. It is the ONLY fully trustless asset in the ecosystem, since it's the native asset. Everything else has some trust assumptions and isn't fully backed by the security of the network (e.g. Tether could easily collapse independently of Ethereum, WBTC has counterparty risk, etc.). Native asset + scarcity = lots of DeFi stuff is backed by using Ether as collateral to take out loans or mint stablecoins and such. The higher the value, the more stuff you can do with it, which adds on-chain activity, which burns more ETH, etc. It's a whole bunch of feedback loops.\n\nSome quick diagrams to illustrate the point:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/mbQ59Kx.png",

We know that misinformation, online disinformation campaigns and other active measures [1](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html) have formed a key component of Putin's strategy in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine [2](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/11/12/the-grus-mh17-disinformation-operations-part-1-the-bonanza-media-project/) [3](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/01/05/kremlins-shifting-self-contradicting-narratives-mh17/), elsewhere in Eastern Europe [4](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/holgerroonemaa/russia-propaganda-baltics-baltnews) [5](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/18/reconstruction-full-incredible-story-behind-russias-deadly-plot/) and around the world [6](https://medium.com/@ushadrons) [7](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/05/10/thousands-russian-bought-facebook-social-media-ads-released-congress/849959001/) and as such I strongly believe that it is important to equip you with the ability to at least have a chance of identifying and avoiding this kind of manipulation.\n\n\nThere are a variety of subreddits devoted to recording and studying this such as r/ActiveMeasures, r/Disinfo and the sub that I run, r/trollfare. We've gathered a collection of resources on our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/trollfare/wiki/index), the most relevant of which relate to how trolls, bad faith actors and Active Measures agents will try to control and steer an online discussion [8](https://pastebin.com/raw/irj4Fyd5) [9](https://medium.com/s/story/a-field-guide-to-bad-faith-arguments-7-terrible-arguments-in-your-mentions-ee4f194afbc9) [10](http://www.iftf.org/fileadmin/user_upload/images/DigIntel/SR-2002_IFTF_Biology_of_disinformation_tk_042618.pdf).\n\n\nAnd here are some user analysis tools that you can use to check on suspicious accounts:\n\n\n* https://reddit-user-analyser.netlify.app/ is the simplest and fastest user analysis tool that I know of. It provides a list of the top 100 subreddits a user has posted in and their most commonly used 100 words, excluding articles (the/a) and prepositions (in/on/etc.) I think. There are also graphs of their comments and submissions by date. You can use this information to identify users who bolster their reputation in karma farming subs like 'freekarma4you' as well as commonly upvoted subs like 'aww', 'pics', or any popular sports teams. There is obviously nothing wrong with someone posting on sites like that in general, but if an account only posted replies like \"cute bunny\" or \"go ManU!\" for years and then suddenly start spouting exclusively kremlin talking points then you might have reason for suspicion! \n\n\n* https://redditmetis.com/ - Is another site that analyzes a user, similar to reddit-user-analyser but in addition to displaying where and when they post and get karma it also will actually use their posts to extract information they have stated about themselves such as their employment, nationality etc. This shouldn't be taken as reliable as not only can it make mistakes but it also has no way of knowing if a user has lied. Some information has a # link next to it which leads you to the comment from which the information was extracted, this lets you consider context and judge it's veracity for yourself. Another great feature of redditmetis is the activity heatmap, showing when in the day a user posts. If they claim to be from Canada but they only post in working hours Moscow time then that may raise a red flag...\n\n\n* https://www.redditinvestigator.com/ - Similar to the first two however much slower to generate the analysis. I'd suggest giving it a try, although I use it much less than the others. The one unique feature is that it extracts the website links used in submissions to show you if the user frequently links to certain sites. In the context of this conflict look for sites like RT (Russia Today) and Sputniknews being shared a lot.\n\n\n* https://camas.github.io/reddit-search/ - This site lets you search all comments a user has made on a certain sub, within a certain timeframe and/or including keywords. If you wanted to find all the posts made by account X in the sub Y that included the term Z you could do so. \n\n\n* https://redditcommentsearch.com/ - Does similar to the above but with less search options. No fields to limit date range for example, but otherwise perfectly useful. Sometimes simplicity is good.\n\n\n* https://www.reveddit.com/ and https://www.removeddit.com/ - Both of these sites allow you to view deleted comments from discussions, assuming that the comments wasn't removed too quickly. You'll often see users arguing in what appears to be bad faith, spreading disinformation, then when someone disproves their bullshit or calls them out the bad-faith user may delete their comments, so when they try something similar again no-one can see that they shouldn't be trusted. Either of these sites provide you with a counter to these reputation management techniques, allowing you to view and share evidence of previous manipulation attempts that the user may think they have scrubbed from the record.\n\n\n* https://subredditstats.com/subreddit-user-overlaps - You can use this site to compare subreddit userbase similarities, as a kind of meta analysis of what you're doing by just checking profiles and useful if you see a subreddit that you don't recognize or start to see a pattern with lots of accounts posting in a certain sub.\n\n\nI hope that this lot is helpful, we're entering a period where I'm expecting disinfo here to really ramp-up, hopefully by working together we can counter it to a certain extent. Please, please copy and paste this comment wherever you like, especially when you see threads with suspicious accounts. Don't call them out directly as this may get you banned in some subs, and don't reply to them even to argue as the primary role maybe just to derail discussion and therefore crack a consensus that is forming. Instead just post this in reply to the person they are interacting with, or just wherever you like really.\n\nThank you so much for your time, I appreciate that this isn't directly on topic for this sub, and I really appreciate you taking the threat of misinformation and manipulation seriously enough to read through this lot. \n\nMinimalGravitas",

Vitalik was certainly the main driver of the early concepts leaning on many astute technical advisors. If it had been possible, Ethereum would have launched as a PoS chain. At the time, a decentralized PoS was only an idea and had never been implemented. Proof-of-Work was well tested and proven by Bitcoin and simple to implement. Launching with PoW would allow the Ethereum Virtual Machine to start proving its use while PoS was developed. It was originally thought the PoS switch would happen 8-12months after launch, but it became much more difficult than first thought and has been in development ever since.",

At that point, all the nodes are required to update to the new version, but is up to the every node whether or not they update. It could be a possible scenario that at some point a new version with PoS is released (Eth v2) and some node just refuse to update, and they can even start a separated development (hard fork) which is exactly what happened with Eth Classic (ETC), where the devs decided something that some part of the network didn't agreed, and some nodes didn't update their releases.\n\nSo... it's a mix, the EIP can be written by anybody, the devs vote to implement it, and every single node decides to update or not.",

So 25 distinct pairs of clients ran the merge against mainnet (simulating very closely what the real thing will look like) and all came to consensus on a point in time where PoW ended and PoS started.\n\nThere is very concrete progress being done, but there's still more testing to do and more shadow forks to come. Next friday the devs will get on a call and there's a good chance we get an idea of what the final timeline will look like as far as public testnet merges go, and onto the true mainnet merge.",

Letting people mass transfer money out of the system harms them when the value of their currency literally controls how many resources and arms they can aquire. They aren't just getting free support, they are getting deals to pay for it too.\n\nAnother thing that crypto enthusiasts seem clueless about: **a healthy currency should have a small rate of inflation**. You want it to devalue a little bit over time, because it encourages people to spend money and invest, which in turn grows the economy. \n\nObviously you can't have hyper-inflation, but when the value of the Ukranian dollar drops further and further, becuase of people transferring it to crypto or other currnencies -- **that is going to encourage excess money printing**.\n\n> they'll save their central bank \n\nWhere do you think the majority of their citizens have their money? In banks and cash. They are protecting the interest of their citizens too -- especially considering they are in the midst of a war on their own soil!",

So like instead of one transaction costing $20, you can have a batch that spends $1000 on gas fees for 2000 transactions, or $0.50 per transaction Layer 2, but still $1000 of fee revenue for Layer 1. The idea being that there's way more users willing to pay the $0.50 on L2 than $20 on L1, so it's still added revenue for L1 even if it's less money spent per user\n\nEventually rollups will be the main players competing for L1 blockspace, and they'll have a lot of money to spend so L1 gas fees will probably be super high, contributing to ETH's scarcity (and thus Layer 1 security because proof of stake)",

They promised it in 2017 and didn't deliver. They'll never release it.\n\nThis is what I see:\n\n* Several iterations of novel distributed consensus research, from Slasher through Casper FFG/CBC to Beacon Chain consensus, the latter of which is powered by a brand new BLS signature aggregation standard.\n\nThis is what you see:\n\n* They literally don't have PoS. It's all vaporware.\n\nThis is what I see:\n\n* A modular Proof of Stake consensus mechanism that's been running in production since November 2020 without any major issues, and that's flexible enough to satisfy the Ethereum network's consensus requirement.\n* Kintsugi, Kiln, and mainnet shadow forks, coordinated across 4+ development teams, leading up to a final production merge.\n\nThis is what you see:\n\n* It'll be impossible to switch over to Proof of Stake, it's like changing out the engine of an airplane mid-flight.\n\nThis is what I see:\n\n* At a predetermined Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD), the system switches from the highly tested and very robust PoW consensus to a highly tested and very robust PoS consensus. The actual \"engine swap\" is completely automatic and will have been tested successfully dozens or hundreds of times using real mainnet data.\n* Also, if we're using the plane analogy, the merge is less like swapping out the engine and more like swapping out the pilot. The engine (Ethereum's execution engine) stays the same.\n\nThis is what you see:\n\n* Ethereum slow and expensive\n\nThis is what I see:\n\n* Ethereum developers choosing not to compromise on the chain's long-term values of security and decentralization for short-term temporary gains in cost and speed.\n\nThis is what you see:\n\n* Ethereum gave up on scaling, left it up to private companies making rollups\n\nThis is what I see:\n\n* Instead of Ethereum's future hinging solely on one idea from a single ivory tower development team, we have a capitalistic, survival-of-the-fittest marketplace for scaling solutions, where priate teams are financially incentivized by free market competition to create the product that scales Ethereum the most efficiently.\n* Instead of focusing on providing scaling, the Ethereum dev team is freed up to focus on the easier problem of providing the tools required for others to provide scaling.\n\nThis is what you say:\n\n* \"I'll believe it when I see it. Until it launches, it doesn't exist.\"\n\nThis is what I say:\n\n* \"I see the code right in front of me. Until it launches, I understand exactly how the system works and at what stage it is in development.\"\n\n*Dear low-information Ethereum critic,*\n\nStop squinting at Ethereum and shouting at me about how blurry it looks. Either put on the goggles or kindly go away. That is all.\n\n---\n\n*Edit for /u/Revanchist1*\n\nThis is what you think of me:\n\n* \"You got lucky! Anyone could have taken that gamble. I was smart enough to avoid gambling in the first place.\"\n\nThis is what I think of you:\n\n* \"It's a real marvel that my calculated investment in this new asset class has paid off. It's too bad that you and the rest of the general public didn't have the specialized expertise in finance and distributed systems engineering to be able to properly understand the risks and estimate the potential rewards of such an investment. I wish there were some way for me to impart my expertise so that other laypeople like you could also benefit from my investment methodology, as it saddens me on some level that this type of expertise contributes towards further increases in the wealth gap.\"",

The only reason why people *wouldn't* expect it to happen then is because they know this is Ethereum and their target timeframes mean *absolutely nothing*. \n\nSharding is now frequently talked about as coming \"about a year\" after the merge.

As in, even while its effects will start to be felt in June-ish, it's not too drastic in the sense that it will initially only result in slightly longer block-times. So, if the client- and core developers are confident that both the protocol and clients are good to go in late-April, they'll proceed with starting to fork the testnets as a preparation for a mainnet merge.\n\nIf not, the difficulty bomb will be postponed. I wouldn't be surprised if it's still postponed, just so there's a safety net in the case something game-breaking props up.\n\n>It's certainly news to me and something must have happened for that. At least \"X takes longer than we expected\".\n\nThere hasn't really been anything major that has happened. Kiln merged fine, as did the recent mainnet shadow-merge, even wile both had some initial issues on the execution side of things. But that's testing, and the more bugs/bizarre edge-cases that are found, the better.",

Whether the issue has been improving medicine, reducing global hunger, or whatever, the solution has ultimately been 'growth'.

With that number, the results are far from representative and probably wouldn't even justify a survey in a single state. No mention either as to how the survey was conducted. Was it online? In person? By phone? By mail? By fax? Maybe they sent smoke signals?\n\nThey don't even show the questionnaire, nor say if they restricted the percentage of respondents for each age range on par with the age distribution in America, and same goes for residence or sex. Were the respondents 50% male and 50% female, just as the sex distribution in America that you would expect for a \"national\" survey? No survey can be trusted if they don't specify how it was conducted. This is the equivalent of toilet paper and the veracity of the facts the same as propaganda.\n\nCarrying an actual national survey about any matter in a country as populated as the US is VERY expensive, which is why governments are usually the few ones taking this endeavour. Having a representative sample of your whole country involves interviewing many elders, and since not everyone uses the internet, big amounts of money go into financing door-to-door interviews. But of course, no mention of that in this study, which affirms to be national, whatever that means according to them.",

If more than 1/3rd of the network is offline the network cannot finalize blocks and will begin the inactivity leak until the validators still attesting control 2/3rds of the stake. \n\nThe difference is because PoW and PoS arrive at the \"longest chain\" metric by significantly different means. In PoW, whoever solves the hashing problems quickest and builds the longest chain wins, period. That's pretty easy. In PoS, the consensus algorithm (Casper for ETH) is more complex and relies on validator votes. It's very important to have a quorum of validators so that the chain can't be easily taken over by a minority staker. At the same time, you can't *always* require a quorum because you also need to produce blocks. So offline penalties and the inactivity leak were introduced. This way the protocol *can* always require a quorum, but it also has a mechanism to penalize offline validators in order to reduce the number required for said quorum and ensure that finality will eventually be reached. \n\nHighly recommend these resources for more info: \n\nhttps://eth.wiki/en/concepts/proof-of-stake-faqs\n\nhttps://upgrading-ethereum.info/altair/",

So, it takes one day of being online to get back to net $0. If you are offline all the time, you keep losing money until all your money is gone.

Imagine an attacker with 30% of all coins. In the current state, he can't do anything since he will be slashed to oblivion if he tries to attack the network. But if he can simply convince 10% of the network to go offline, he can then stop finality. With no cost for going offline, the attacker simply needs to pay the validators art least as much as their block rewards would have been. With penalties for being offline, the cost to attack is significantly increased.\n\nSince the penalties for being offline scale with the number of offline participants, it means that for the averglage user, downtime is no big deal, but if you are not following best practices (using a centralized server to host, like AWS or using GETH, etc) and that service has a bug or downtime, you will be punished far greater because much of the network is affected at the same time.\n\nAdditionally, running a validator requires a fairly substantial amount of capital and it is not something that should be just turned on an off at will. Allowing fair weather validators brings security issues since those validators aren't really paying attention too well. The online requirements really do go a long way towards ensuring that participants are keeping their systems updated and maintained and that they are maintaining security.\n\nPlus in the future you will just be able to exit and re enter later after a small queue, so it really doesn't matter too much",

                            "response": "Apologies for hijacking the top comment here, just wanted to share some tools and resources that users discussing this topic should really be familiar with. We know that misinformation, online disinformation campaigns and other active measures [1](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html) have formed a key component of Putin's strategy in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine [2](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/11/12/the-grus-mh17-disinformation-operations-part-1-the-bonanza-media-project/) [3](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/01/05/kremlins-shifting-self-contradicting-narratives-mh17/), elsewhere in Eastern Europe [4](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/holgerroonemaa/russia-propaganda-baltics-baltnews) [5](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/18/reconstruction-full-incredible-story-behind-russias-deadly-plot/) and around the world [6](https://medium.com/@ushadrons) [7](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/05/10/thousands-russian-bought-facebook-social-media-ads-released-congress/849959001/) and as such I strongly believe that it is important to equip you with the ability to at least have a chance of identifying and avoiding this kind of manipulation.\n\n\nThere are a variety of subreddits devoted to recording and studying this such as r/ActiveMeasures, r/Disinfo and the sub that I run, r/trollfare. We've gathered a collection of resources on our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/trollfare/wiki/index), the most relevant of which relate to how trolls, bad faith actors and Active Measures agents will try to control and steer an online discussion [8](https://pastebin.com/raw/irj4Fyd5) [9](https://medium.com/s/story/a-field-guide-to-bad-faith-arguments-7-terrible-arguments-in-your-mentions-ee4f194afbc9) [10](http://www.iftf.org/fileadmin/user_upload/images/DigIntel/SR-2002_IFTF_Biology_of_disinformation_tk_042618.pdf).\n\n\nAnd here are some user analysis tools that you can use to check on suspicious accounts:\n\n\n* https://reddit-user-analyser.netlify.app/ is the simplest and fastest user analysis tool that I know of. It provides a list of the top 100 subreddits a user has posted in and their most commonly used 100 words, excluding articles (the/a) and prepositions (in/on/etc.) I think. There are also graphs of their comments and submissions by date. You can use this information to identify users who bolster their reputation in karma farming subs like 'freekarma4you' as well as commonly upvoted subs like 'aww', 'pics', or any popular sports teams. There is obviously nothing wrong with someone posting on sites like that in general, but if an account only posted replies like \"cute bunny\" or \"go ManU!\" for years and then suddenly start spouting exclusively kremlin talking points then you might have reason for suspicion! \n\n\n* https://redditmetis.com/ - Is another site that analyzes a user, similar to reddit-user-analyser but in addition to displaying where and when they post and get karma it also will actually use their posts to extract information they have stated about themselves such as their employment, nationality etc. This shouldn't be taken as reliable as not only can it make mistakes but it also has no way of knowing if a user has lied. Some information has a # link next to it which leads you to the comment from which the information was extracted, this lets you consider context and judge it's veracity for yourself. Another great feature of redditmetis is the activity heatmap, showing when in the day a user posts. If they claim to be from Canada but they only post in working hours Moscow time then that may raise a red flag...\n\n\n* https://www.redditinvestigator.com/ - Similar to the first two however much slower to generate the analysis. I'd suggest giving it a try, although I use it much less than the others. The one unique feature is that it extracts the website links used in submissions to show you if the user frequently links to certain sites. In the context of this conflict look for sites like RT (Russia Today) and Sputniknews being shared a lot.\n\n\n* https://camas.github.io/reddit-search/ - This site lets you search all comments a user has made on a certain sub, within a certain timeframe and/or including keywords. If you wanted to find all the posts made by account X in the sub Y that included the term Z you could do so. \n\n\n* https://redditcommentsearch.com/ - Does similar to the above but with less search options. No fields to limit date range for example, but otherwise perfectly useful. Sometimes simplicity is good.\n\n\n* https://www.reveddit.com/ and https://www.removeddit.com/ - Both of these sites allow you to view deleted comments from discussions, assuming that the comments wasn't removed too quickly. You'll often see users arguing in what appears to be bad faith, spreading disinformation, then when someone disproves their bullshit or calls them out the bad-faith user may delete their comments, so when they try something similar again no-one can see that they shouldn't be trusted. Either of these sites provide you with a counter to these reputation management techniques, allowing you to view and share evidence of previous manipulation attempts that the user may think they have scrubbed from the record.\n\n\n* https://subredditstats.com/subreddit-user-overlaps - You can use this site to compare subreddit userbase similarities, as a kind of meta analysis of what you're doing by just checking profiles and useful if you see a subreddit that you don't recognize or start to see a pattern with lots of accounts posting in a certain sub.\n\n\nI hope that this lot is helpful, we're entering a period where I'm expecting disinfo here to really ramp-up, hopefully by working together we can counter it to a certain extent. Please, please copy and paste this comment wherever you like, especially when you see threads with suspicious accounts. Don't call them out directly as this may get you banned in some subs, and don't reply to them even to argue as the primary role maybe just to derail discussion and therefore crack a consensus that is forming. Instead just post this in reply to the person they are interacting with, or just wherever you like really.\n\nThank you so much for your time, I appreciate that this isn't directly on topic for this sub, and I really appreciate you taking the threat of misinformation and manipulation seriously enough to read through this lot. \n\nMinimalGravitas",

                    "response": "There's a few key things that are always forgotten by people who say \"no one is gonna want to spend Ether if it's deflationary and always goes up in value\", and you mentioned a few of them, so I'll just add:\n\n1. Ether is not inherently deflationary, it only becomes deflationary when so many people actively use it enough that the burn rate outpaces the issuance rate. There is some equilibrium point where issuance = burn, at which point the supply may very well inflate something like 0.5% every year by issuing 2% and burning 1.5% (numbers pulled out of my ass but you get it)\n\n2. Ethereum's blockspace is what people are after, not Ether. Ether is just the asset you use to pay for Ethereum's blockspace. If you want to use Ethereum, you *have* to spend Ether.\n\nPoint 2 is the crux of my overall long-term thesis for Ethereum and Ether. If you spend $100 on blockspace, then you have to burn $100's worth of Ether on blockspace. You don't do that unless the economic utility you get out of that blockspace exceeds the $100 you spent on it. So as long as Ethereum is in demand, people have to spend Ether to meet that demand.\n\nSo when you're spending $100's worth of Ether on Ethereum blockspace, there's a few ways to do it:\n\n1. Buy $100's worth of Ether at today's prices and immediately spend it\n\n2. Use it from your Ether bag that you bought at a lower price months/years ago, so the $100's worth of Ether you're spending today only cost you $75 back when the price was lower\n\n3. Use it from the yield you got from staking ETH. You put up some fixed amount of ETH in staking and now you're getting rewards essentially for free, and you're spending those rewards on blockspace.\n\nIf Ether is an inflating/depreciated asset, then the best move is 1. But if it's an appreciative asset, then 2 and 3 are the way to go. And in terms of network security, you want the staking collateral to have a high value to make sure attacks are very very costly. So the more people hoard/stake, the more economic value the whole network has, which furthers solidifes Ethereum's selling point as a secure settlement layer to move value around and post any kind of data with guaranteed availability.\n\ntl;dr Having Ether be an appreciative asset is good for the network, its holders, its users, and its stakers.

I've never spent under $200 in fees to purchase ERC-20 tokens. I understand you said Ether and not its tokens, but is that the only reason? If it's simply a matter of supply and demand and the average is $5, I'd expect for every transaction costing $100 would be balanced with dozens of transactions under $1, right? I'm not saying you're wrong in any way, I just lack enough knowledge to understand how my experiences with tokens (and the general perception that ETH fees are astronomical) can be true if the average cost is $5.

                            "response": "> I understand you said Ether and not its tokens, but is that the only reason?\n\nYeah pretty much, it's not \"average transaction\", it's a transfer of Ether which is more like the bare minimum cost of a transaction. The cost scales with computation, and computation is abstracted with \"gas\". The supply and demand bit comes from the fact that there's only so much gas available in every block, so people outbid each other to use that gas before others. \n\nA transfer of ETH uses 21,000 units of gas. A transfer of an ERC20 requires an interaction with a smart contract which can be around 65k gas, and a swap (probably what you mean by purchasing an ERC20 token) is more expensive at ~200k gas, although Uniswap V3 went heavy on the optimization and my recent swaps have been more like 120k gas\n\nThe USD price is always a function of how much gas is used \u00d7 the cost of each gas unit in gwei \u00d7 the price of ETH in USD. So I got my $5 from doing `21k gas \u00d7 75 gwei/gas \u00d7 3200 USD/ETH = ~$5`. Gas went up and it's more like 150 atm so make that $10\n\nAt the ATH (~$4800) the same 75 gwei transfer worked out to $7.56 and it was even more brutal to do a 200k gas swap at $4800 and 200 gwei (close to $200)\n\nBut also the MetaMask quote is not the total you pay, it's always *up to* that amount. It overestimates both the gas you're gonna use and the cost in gwei of every gas. So for example it could quote you 200k gas \u00d7 100 gwei ($64) but in the end your transaction only used 150k gas at 80 gwei, so you \"only\" pay $38.40 and get the rest refunded.\n\nDon't get me wrong it's still expensive af (even that $5 is too much by several orders of magnitude) but it's worth understanding the reasons and the math behind all that so you can at least plan your stuff more carefully when you do have to do a transaction on mainnet.",

Specifically, Ethereum's policy has not \"always been\" \"minimum viable issuance\" or \"minimum necessary issuance.\"  The first instance of either of those phrases appears to be early 2019, judging by google search + web.archive.org.\n\nEthereum's original economic policy was \"5 Ether per block, in perpetuity\", with the intent that \"5 Ether per block\" would represent an increasingly small rate of inflation as the monetary base grows.\n\nIf you wish to counter that claim, please find a reference to this concept (hopefully the exact phrase, but an explanation would do) that predates, say, 2018.\n\n> Anyone can propose an Ethereum Improvement Proposal. You just have to convince others it's a good idea to implement it (most EIPs don't get implemented and fall into obscurity) and the clients could just refuse to code it in if it's a very bad idea. The more time passes, the harder it becomes to push changes to the Ethereum protocol and everything converges to the status quo. (This doesn't close the door to further innovation however, as it's still an open platform on which anyone can build)\n\nThis is subject to the [Tyranny of Structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm), and isn't as transparent as it appears on the surface.\n\n> Vitalik regularly gets his proposals blocked by client teams, other researchers, or the community in general.\n\n[citation needed]. To date, I've not seen a single Vitalik-supported EIP get rejected; nor have I seen a single Vitalik-rejected EIP get accepted.  If either of these is a regular occurrence, I suspect this will be easy to provide.\n\n> It wasn't a bailout of Vitalik and his pals, it was a bailout of a huge chunk of the community from an event that could have killed the whole thing in its infancy.\n\nThis is also incorrect.  The biggest voter turnouts were less than [15% of hashrate](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4tffta/hard_fork_voting_and_node_adoption_results/) and less than [10% of coins](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6d62td/the_story_behind_ethereum_classic_etc_and_whos/di3a0ql/).  This is neither a \"huge chunk of the community\" nor (more importantly) a majority of the community.  The implication of this basic fact is that this was indeed a *minority bailout fork*. \n\nIn fact, the *only* deciding factor was which side of the fork was chosen to be the default by the developer-sanctioned clients.  In fact, Vitalik goes on to admit this in his writing about \"legitimacy\", the very one you linked.  The chain that the core developers committed to continuing development on was the \"legitimate chain\", because they lent it their legitimacy.  Let's not forget that the one vote that was supposedly a \"community vote\" that \"determined what the default option would be\" was originally and explicitly called out as *not being an official vote*, with those same developers committing to never treat it as such.  They then changed their minds on this approximately 12 hours before they released the client*s* that would support this fork, indicating that the core developers had already decided *internally* what the outcome would be.\n\nIn a network that cannot achieve a majority quorum of voters, the controlling stake is controlled by whoever gets to set the defaults and deem to be the \"legitimate\" outcome.  In this case, that was Vitalik and a (relatively) small set of developers of the Ethereum clients.  I've [talked about this in depth](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7y166g/on_the_topic_of_decentralized_governance/dud1evl/) when considering the implications of Ethereum's \"opt-out\" governance model.\n\nLet's not forget that [Vitalik was actively buying DAO tokens at the time](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/741832934814949377).  If that's not an economic indicator that he had total confidence that the fork would happen, even before community votes happened, I don't know what could convince anyone.  Economic incentives are what this entire ecosystem is built on, are they not?\n\nAdditionally, the [DAO hack was not an existential threat](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4rohdy/vlad_zamfirs_thoughts_on_the_hard_fork/d52s60v/).\n\n> As far as the initial distribution goes\n\nThis sidesteps the issue that the initial distribution was 100% opaque, and there *were no restrictions placed on insiders buying tokens in their own crowdsale*.  In fact, there's no plausible way [Joe Lubin](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/11/sale-of-the-century-the-inside-story-of-ethereums-2014-premine/) (for example, ctrl+f for his name) could have as much Ethereum as he did without participating in the sale himself.  As a beneficiary of the sale, this allows him to essentially buy Ether from himself during the crowdsale, as no cost (whenever he gets paid back).  In fact, before the crowdsale was even done, the Ethereum Foundation was [already taking distributions](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/08/announcement-on-planned-exodus-withdrawal/) from the Exodus address to \"pay back loans\".  Who were those loans being paid back to?  It's plausible that some of these were loans taken out by insiders to buy tokens in the crowdsale, after which they paid back the loans and kept the purchased Ether.\n\nThis is the crucial difference between an ICO (Ethereum's in particular) and a public IPO: insiders are explicitly not allowed to participate in an IPO because they are the primary beneficiaries of the IPO.  There exist transparency requirements and legal restrictions that prevent double-dipping in IPOs; no such mechanisms existed in the Ethereum ICO.  In fact, from a purely economic standpoint, the beneficiaries of the Ethereum crowdsale would be considered \"irrational\" to *not* participate in their own sale, minting tokens for \"free\".  Given the pseudonymous nature of both Ethereum and Bitcoin, to anyone outside the scheme, their purchases would look identical to participants from \"the public\".  The *only* way to expose such a scheme would be for an insider to reveal the scheme.",

By the time the bomb got delayed, reducing the block reward to 3 ETH/block actually *increased* Miners' overall rewards by lowering the block time and that was the reasoning given in the EIP that pushed the bomb and reduced the reward (the alternative of not delaying the bomb being of course that the network would crawl to a halt with huge block times). Of course rewards didn't jump up to the level they were at 5 ETH pre-bomb, but the point is it was always the case from the start that miners would progressively get less and less due to increasing block time.

As far as the early emission schedule was concerned, the effect of the Ice Age wasn't really considered.  In fact, this whole notion of \"but the Ice Age would reduce issuance\" can only be traced back to the original EIPs (either the first or second) that proposed reducing the issuance in the first place; and it wasn't proposed as a mechanism until after it was pointed out that the issuance was supposed to be constant anyway.  The [original Ice Age mechanism](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/04/ethereum-protocol-update-1/) also mentions nothing about reducing issuance.\n\nIn other words, the narrative about the Ice Age being intended to reduce issuance (or implied to) is [post-hoc rationalization](https://skepticink.com/tippling/2013/11/14/post-hoc-rationalisation-reasoning-our-intuition-and-changing-our-minds/).\n\nReducing the issuance wasn't to \"screw miners\", it was to satiate the needs of bagholders who believed that reducing issuance would increase price.  In fact, the [proposer](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5l9j59/december_roundup_ethereum_blog/dbufcd6/?context=3) of the original EIP [explicitly stated this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/5jem1h/any_eth_investors_know_much_about_github/).\n\nSadly, this kind of historical revisionism is rampant among various proponents of Ethereum, the core devs included.\n\n> But admittedly this is totally besides the point and not even what you're arguing for.

Does your claim about Joe boil down to this one sentence? \"Joe Lubin is rumored to be the biggest holder of ETH to come out of the crowdsale, though he says that\u2019s not the case.\"\n\nMy claim is also based on the ridiculously large amount of Ether (specifically) Consensys has thrown at various startups an incubators over the years.  He also has claimed to other people to be a \"crypto billionaire\" multiple times over the years (including to reporters and such), which would necessitate having hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of Ether at various times.  Getting that amount and not *already being* a billionaire implies that he got it when it was very cheap (i.e. the crowdsale).\n\nMany second-hand sources, but I'd imagine he has plausible deniability reasons for never making the claim on the record.\n\n> Also going down the plausibility hole, why didn't any of them expose it? Especially the ones who have since left the EF and started competing projects. It would be an easy move to go public and hurt Ethereum's credibility if there were any kind of proof or message trail to suggest such a move from insiders.\n\nBecause I imagine the reasons for doing it in the first place largely revolve around obtaining a large amount of money in a tax-free way.  Exposing the scheme would mean exposing their own fraud.  A double-bind, if you will.\n\n> But yeah, the opacity of the ICO does look sus from the angle you bring up, I guess that's the other side of the whole permissionless no KYC sale thing. Still, I would argue the time to worry about the presale being a scam to steal Bitcoin is long gone.\n\nI mean, yes and not.  PoS' entire security model relies on the *current* value of the Ether held; I'd posit that someone who bought millions of Ether for pennies would have far different incentives when it comes to burning it than someone who actually spent billions on similar quantities.  In fact, putting a dollar value on the security of Ether is totally flawed when the price *was* so low so long ago.\n\nThis is especially true given the amount of power that comes with controlling the consensus layer, given that switching to PoS was the plan all along.  What better way to ensure you always control who gets money out of the system than by buying a supermajority of the \"hashpower\" when it was very cheap; if you assume that the price will go up along the way, you end up in an unassailable position.\n\nCouple this with deflationary economic policy and you have a majority stake in the system that literally cannot be diluted away.  Seems rather dangerous.\n\n> For the rest of the points it looks like I have a lot more rabbitholes to fall into, you definitely bring a lot of nuance that I have to look into more deeply and it looks like you've been an informed part of the space for way longer than me. Again, all that stuff is welcome from me!\n\nOne of the advantages to being in the space for a long time is exposure to nuance, complications, and inconvenient truths that many of the strongest proponents would rather have forgotten.\n\nLike the fact that the [DAO fork was never necessary](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/805gcn/vitalik_said_doing_rescue_forks_in_exceptional/duveapx/?context=3), for one interesting example.  When you consider that from a technical standpoint the fork was never necessary, you're left with two plausible incentives to go ahead with it anyway:\n\n1. It carries slightly less risk than a purely on-chain solution\n2. You get to make a shitload of money if you bought a bunch of DAO tokens while the exchange rate was depressed due to the public sentiment.  The redemption rate of the withdrawal mechanism implemented by the hard fork was 100 DAO to 1 Eth; between the hack and the hard fork, DAO were trading at around 100 DAO to .7 Eth, on average.  If you a) knew the fork would happen because you controlled the defaults, and b) were buying DAO tokens while the price was depressed, you'd make a cool, risk-free 30+% profit after the fork.\n\n> It's pretty clear you know a lot about Ethereum's part, so I'm curious about your opinion about its future. Optimistic: yay or nay? And (if I can ask) are you invested in Ether to any significant degree?\n\nHighly pessimistic.  I've been thoroughly divested from Ether for a long time for ideological reasons.  I don't think the core developers in particular have the altruistic goals they claim they do, and refuse to support that by putting my money into the system.  However, at the same time, I think they're running a highly-effective con that just might actually produce something marginally useful through the power of collective delusion.  It also depends on your metric of success: if you think investing in Ether will make you rich? I'd think you're probably right, at least over the short- to medium-term.  If you think it'll actually be a \"revolutionary technology\"?  I don't think it ever will achieve that kind of goal.  At the end of the day, it's just replacing one set of elites with a different one.",

If you're burning a billion dollars' worth of Ether, then that's a billion dollars you could have gotten by selling your ETH at current prices (either OTC or spread out buys because liquidity) instead of doing the attack. So whatever incentives for the attack would still have to be greater than $1B even if you bought all those Ether for pennies.\n\nAlso, Vlad Zamfir's comment you linked about why the DAO hack wasn't an existential threat runs directly against that argument. The DAO hacker could have had ~15% of the supply (which would have been diluted to ~10% today) at a cost basis of effectively zero. The arguments he gave apply just as easily to an EF insider who would have gotten a crapton of Ether for cheap. (Except the EF insider's economic interests are much more Ethereum-aligned than some anon who ran an exploit, of course)\n\nSo is it or is it not a big deal for POS security if someone got a lot of Ether a long time ago for very cheap?",

Reddit is a very big network, where all can interact with each other. Reddit is literally built open those theories. Give people simple ways towards DAO voting, loyalty & membership, decentralized \"kind-of\" ownership of their subs through someone they trust for years now (that's you Reddit), and magic might happen.\n\nI mean, it's in plain sight. Upcoming blockchains/web3/daos need to launchpad/airdrop/pay you and whatever next to get people in, because they do not have a network.\n\nAdd on top the need for a network, to build a new network the barrier to entry for a newcomer is; choose and setup up some from somewhere wallet, understand addresses, networks, currencies, log on to some websites and connect with that wallet, sign some contracts, and then buy something nao to do anything is ludicrous and full of fear, and it means the participants are still very much early adopters despite blockchains being a decade old by now.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised Reddit knows what they are doing, they generally do, but other networks are also doing it. They just aren't comfortable rolling something out through fear of alienating their customers. Well, or tried and magnificently blew it because they do not understand, that they have to do this as a way to create value for customers between customers (the network). That and don't try to be a predatory man-in-the-middle actor.\n\nI shouldn't drink coffee on weekends and start posting shit, but here I am. Hope y'all are well wherever you are, and have a great day <3  \n\n\nEdit: Obviously not enough coffee so fixed that paragraph",

You can't demand that only the good parts of crypto be taken seriously and dismiss any of the negative externalities. That kind of bullshit is why so many non-crypto folks roll their eyes about crypto. It comes across as bullshit when the crypto community says crypto is going to change the world, rework the entire nature of money and finance, destroy the entire banking industry, bring financial freedom to billions, yet somehow have absolutely zero negative consequences. There's always some negatives that come along with progress, and when we pretend there aren't we come off as cultists with our heads in the sand.",

Nothing else impacts gas price. \n\nSo, if people are ready to pay with current gas price for more transactions than 15M within a block, they do, because it's an auction. If so, gas price increases, until people don't want to pay for such gas price anymore, in which case gas price decreases. That's why it's self-regulated. \n\nOf course, when I say people, it's about all Ethereum users. Yet some users are ready to pay for way more than others. It results in some users getting stranded until gas price decreases, for their use cases doesn't justify for themselves to make transactions with such gas prices. We've historically seen this with big NFT minters and, years ago, with cryptokitty players. \n\nThe gas price may probably skyrocket, but it would be due to hype, not directly due to ETH price. Though ETH price increases has historically been tied to hype, it's a correlation, not a causation. Most probably, hype is the cause of both gas price increases (due to increased number of transactions) and ETH price increases (due to increased volumes bought by market takers on exchanges). \n\nIt is expected there will be some hype, so maybe using an L2 now probably is for the best. That or using a centralized exchange, with different risks tied to such choice (there will be risks anyway, though, just not the same ones).",

I agree its quite the opposite, with PoS if a guy is 100x richer than you, he gets 100x more rewards. With PoW the guy who is 100x richer than you have the ability and social networking to buy more and cheaper rigs and to secure much cheaper electricity, so at the end he gets much more than 100x rewards.\n\nThis also hits decentralisation at a different angle by centralizing mining at big mining facilities at places with cheap electricity, and the effect of this was seen during the Xinjiang blackout when the Bitcoin network lost over 45% of its hash rate.\n\nAt that moment in time, all China needed to do to take over the Bitcoin network was to take control over the big chinese mining facilities and turn them against the network with impunity because there is no defense mechanism with PoW. With PoS unlike PoW, nobody knows where the validators are and you get slashed if you want to play dirty.\n\nWant to add also that after The Merge, even if there is sell the news event, circulating ETH will suffer a huge supply shock comparable to 2-3 Bitcoin halvenings at once and in the next few months the price will start rising quite fast till it reaches it's new equilibrium.\n\nI don't believe in the sell the news event thesis, quite the opposite, a successful merge will send shockwaves not only through the crypto world but outside aswell.\n\nPoS has a very strong environmental narrative and The Merge will reignite the retail investor interest in the Ethereum network.",

If I just accept the premise that a random number is selected or a random grouping is determined, etc., I think I mostly follow the rest, but I'm having trouble understanding how there is consensus about the random number/order/grouping. Like I can understand how one computer can generate a random number (although more complex than it sounds) but how does the whole network agree on a \"random\" input? How can we verify randomness (fairness)? Wouldn't a single node have to \"propose\" this random input?\n\nI know my understanding must be flawed/incomplete because it seems to me that you need a consensus for the inputs required for consensus, which just leads me into this recursive path back to the original problem. Much appreciated if someone can point me in the right direction. Thanks!",

Wouldn't a single node have to \"propose\" this random input?\n\nThe way I understand it, it's a series of commit-and-reveal schemes where everyone participates by picking a random number and merging them together and using that as the seed of a pseudo-random number generator.\n\nTo avoid biasing and gaming the PRNG algorithm, each node has to broadcast the hash of their random number beforehand, so they're committed to their random number before they know everyone else's number. Then once the process is done, the whole thing is deterministic, you can work out the seed from everyone's number and verify the randomness happened like it was supposed to.\n\nIt's a bit more complicated than that but it's the gist of it, you can read about it from Vitalik's annotated specs [here](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/beacon-chain.md#aside-randao-seeds-and-committee-generation)",

With decentralized chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum who have a culture of users running their own nodes, it doesn't matter if someone has 51% hashrate or even 99% hashrate, your node will always refuse an invalid transaction. The worst they can really do is censor the chain (refuse to include certain transactions).\n\nIn PoW if someone starts building invalid blocks (double spends, fake transactions, etc) it will just be refused by the network and the valid nodes will follow miners who create real blocks.\n\nIn Ethereum's PoS if there was 51% of blocks being proposed containing invalid data then the chain would stop finalizing, the attacks slashed and then exited from the chain until the amount of bad actors is less than 66%. Ethereum needs 66% agreement to finalize the chain.\n\nThe key difference is with PoW, someone with 51% hashrate can just keep attacking the chain and causing disruptions, nothing can really stop them. With PoS an attack results in the attacker actually losing their staked Ether, which makes it insanely expensive to attack PoS instead of PoW.
