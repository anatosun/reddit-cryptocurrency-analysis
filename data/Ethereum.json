You want it to devalue a little bit over time, because it encourages people to spend money and invest, which in turn grows the economy. \n\nObviously you can't have hyper-inflation, but when the value of the Ukranian dollar drops further and further, becuase of people transferring it to crypto or other currnencies -- **that is going to encourage excess money printing**.\n\n> they'll save their central bank \n\nWhere do you think the majority of their citizens have their money?

Sometimes, in times of crisis, it is necessary for a state to restrict the freedoms of individuals if it means that such an action will help the country survive. \n\nAnd if you all don't understand why the central bank wants to do everything it can to control inflation and capital outflow during a massive war, then maybe y'all should educate yourselves on reality.",

People create transactions which are broadcasted to nodes which broadcast it to validators (nowadays miners) in the mempool. Then, validators add to the block they're trying to create the transactions they want from the transactions they can add. Creating a block bigger than 30M gas ensures it's an invalid block, so validators stop before that.\n\nYes, on the L1, Ethereum NFT transactions are transactions like any others. It's just messages. Some take bigger time to compute or bigger space once computed, that's all. \n\n>I recently discovered that rather than Bitcoin transactions being damaging to the environment, its actually the creation of Bitcoin blocks that are behind the CO2 emissions.\n\nWell, to be more accurate, it's the security of Bitcoin that requires to mine. And that security is a parameter decided by the network: it's the very BTC issuance per block that sets how much profit miners get and thus how many miners will be attracted to the mining activity, up until mining difficulty becomes so high it becomes less profitable. \n\nSo, yes, blocks can be empty and thus the number of transactions doesn't impact how many new blocks are created. For Bitcoin, it's one block every 20 minutes.",

Bitcoin was the first and it was crafted in a way to be simple, secure and immune to outer judgement good or bad. \n\nWhat he is saying, everything else that came after must add compelexity to stand out or try to be what bitcoin isnt. This leads to a variety of problems as he mentions. Want to be faster than bitcoin, have layer 2s or appeal to a different group? Well you are going to lose security, or create a new problem. Bitcoin's simple nature is also its greatest strength. \n\nNow does that mean Eth is bad or some how worth less than bicoin. Not necessarily. It was made with different utilites in mind. Bitcoin works as a store of value, eth works as a utility to provide faster transactions and layer 2s while giving up a bit of the security.\n\nThey both serve a purpose. Being a maximalist means to find what you truly value in both personal liberties and monetary necessaties. It doesnt mean find one coin and disregard the others.  \n\nReading through both bitcoin and eth subs they both provide toxicity of declaring the other to be maximialists. It doesnt have to be that way, and quite frankly bitcoin doesnt care what people think its a simple elqueant forumla. Vitalik is attempting to create something pure but being second means there are a lot of hurdles along the way.",

You could implement something like a put/call with a few lines of code instead of having to hire a hundred c++ programmers who will integrated such stuff in a heavy old mammoth.\nOf course they are right - Ethereum is a much better tech then Bitcoin, you can do on Ethereum way more stuff.\nThe reason why we should listen what they have to say is because all others who don't trust crypto might trust those assholes, thus they have a strong influence on the public acceptance and usage of crypto.\nFor me it's enough to read the headline, besides that I'm with you to not waste to much time on listening what they have to say.

The 5 dollars a PoS system pays out are NOT \"backed\" by an equal cost in the real world, because the main entry barrier here is the staked capital.\n\nIt's called an opportunity cost. You've allocated resources, here ETH, into the staking used by the consensus. It's resources you could have invested elsewhere. Actual resources. The fact you can't touch it doesn't mean it's not an actual resource.\n\n>So, in short: BTC will in the long run either not be successful or kill us all. I am not making a jest.\n\nHm, you're keeping an assumption that is true nowadays but would be false way before it kills us all. You're assuming burning electricity doesn't increase electricity price. It's true when you're only burning a small quantity of it. But once you end up burning more, you end up in an equilibrium where increases in electricity costs reduce the hashing power required to reach an equilibrium between mining profitability and electricity consumed. Just like staking, it's a self-regulated system. Although it has very strong consequences on the availability of electricity for the rest of the market. Just like the relations between fuel, bio fuel and food prices. An increased demand in fuel drives demand in bio fuel which decreases food availability for other purposes and results in starvation here and there.\n\nSo, it would affect us pretty badly, but would also drive innovation in cheap electricity production and wouldn't be able to kill us anyway. It would certainly kill some of use, though, as increasing energy price increases prices through the whole market and drives people into below minimum sustenance.\n\nBesides, it assumes BTC prices can go higher and higher indefinitely. This is also capped, even more so since miners need more and more of an influx of resources to buy and burn all that electricity. The higher the price, the harder it will become to proportionately increase it, both because any increment of a percent would need even more funds and because maintenance costs increase.\n\nThis goes the same for PoS, except that it uses ETH as a resource and will definitely drive innovation in ETH usage and won't have any impact on electricity production and availability.",

People who ignore long term externalities don't give a shit about the environmental cost.  Between a combination of private purchases of old plants and governments in economically distressed areas placing short term gain over long term sustainability, the real equilibrium level you posit is far off because coal isn't being taken out of the grid because of cost(it's cheap and abundant) or lack of availability(there's a surplus of coal powered generation).

The path of least resistance. The least effort is the one that offers better for cheaper.\n\nStop expecting the state to solve that problem. You're a responsible adult. Face reality: this decision has been taken by states in London more than a century ago and they won't stop it now, even more so with use of coercion. All states have followed suit. It was \"for the greater good\". Even if it was literally killing people back then near the Thames, it was still for the \"greater good\". After entire generations of politicians from all parties all around the world, if you're still expecting them to solve your problems for you, maybe you should reflect on why you're not trying to find an actual solution. Sorry to be harsh, here, but there's a reality to face and it's astonishing to observe people still believing the fairy tale of politicians.\n\nIf you want actual solutions and if coal is really that cheap, instead of wasting litteral money on politicians, buy the coal. Coal is a finite resource just as much as electricity. If it's so cheap, it will continue to be used for electricity, with or without PoW. So, gather funds and send it to someone who will buy the coal and sign a contract ensuring he would pay ten times more of that coal is ever burnt.\n\nThis way, you ensure coal isn't burnt, be it to produce electricity or in any other way. Peacefully. Cooperatively. Consentfully. Without waiting for politicians. Without requiring tons of money funneled into politicians for a megre results. Just with part of that money sent to buy the coal. Because let's face it, if there's money that is wasted, it's the money thrown at politicians as if it ever solved any problem. \n\nAnd then, once the rest of the coal becomes rare and expensive, coal will naturally stop being burnt for electricity, for it wouldn't be profitable anymore. Burning it for electricity would become a waste.",

Coinbase takes a 25% cut of that, so after their fee the end-user gets about 3.6%APR today from CB.",

With PoW the guy who is 100x richer than you have the ability and social networking to buy more and cheaper rigs and to secure much cheaper electricity, so at the end he gets much more than 100x rewards.\n\nThis also hits decentralisation at a different angle by centralizing mining at big mining facilities at places with cheap electricity, and the effect of this was seen during the Xinjiang blackout when the Bitcoin network lost over 45% of its hash rate.\n\nAt that moment in time, all China needed to do to take over the Bitcoin network was to take control over the big chinese mining facilities and turn them against the network with impunity because there is no defense mechanism with PoW. With PoS unlike PoW, nobody knows where the validators are and you get slashed if you want to play dirty.\n\nWant to add also that after The Merge, even if there is sell the news event, circulating ETH will suffer a huge supply shock comparable to 2-3 Bitcoin halvenings at once and in the next few months the price will start rising quite fast till it reaches it's new equilibrium.\n\nI don't believe in the sell the news event thesis, quite the opposite, a successful merge will send shockwaves not only through the crypto world but outside aswell.\n\nPoS has a very strong environmental narrative and The Merge will reignite the retail investor interest in the Ethereum network.",

Here's where I'm stuck... \n\nI keep seeing explanations that say something to the effect of \"a validator is chosen at random from a committee\" and \"the Beacon chain randomly groups validators into committees\". If I just accept the premise that a random number is selected or a random grouping is determined, etc., I think I mostly follow the rest, but I'm having trouble understanding how there is consensus about the random number/order/grouping. Like I can understand how one computer can generate a random number (although more complex than it sounds) but how does the whole network agree on a \"random\" input? How can we verify randomness (fairness)? Wouldn't a single node have to \"propose\" this random input?\n\nI know my understanding must be flawed/incomplete because it seems to me that you need a consensus for the inputs required for consensus, which just leads me into this recursive path back to the original problem. Much appreciated if someone can point me in the right direction. Thanks!",

Wouldn't a single node have to \"propose\" this random input?\n\nThe way I understand it, it's a series of commit-and-reveal schemes where everyone participates by picking a random number and merging them together and using that as the seed of a pseudo-random number generator.\n\nTo avoid biasing and gaming the PRNG algorithm, each node has to broadcast the hash of their random number beforehand, so they're committed to their random number before they know everyone else's number. Then once the process is done, the whole thing is deterministic, you can work out the seed from everyone's number and verify the randomness happened like it was supposed to.\n\nIt's a bit more complicated than that but it's the gist of it, you can read about it from Vitalik's annotated specs [here](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/beacon-chain.md#aside-randao-seeds-and-committee-generation)",

Even though they're nothing alike, that output is the deterministic result of sending that input through that series of math operations, such that if you were to send that exact same input through again, you would get the exact same output.\n\nIn doing so, you can turn an input into an output that appears to be random to us, but if you were to repeat it for a second time, then it would produce the same output, breaking the illusion. To address this, you can either feed that output back into the same series of math operations as a new input, or tie the input to something that changes, such as the current time.\n\n*This* is what I think allows all participants in the network to produce the same random output: they're feeding the same data in as the input, likely the block or epoch counter. Although every participant produces the same random output, it appears to be random every time it's generated, and will produce different results over time, as the input is changing.",

The interface between Layer 2 networks and Layer 1 is just a set of smart contracts, same as any other dapp. Every ETH, every token, every smart contract dapp will seemlessly transition to PoS. Unless you're paying close attention to block times, you won't even notice the merge took place!\n\nThe stuff that does affect layer 2 is data sharding, which will require L2s to rewrite part of their smart contracts in order to take advantage of it to save 2-3 orders of magnitude in gas fees. It currently looks like [EIP-4844](https://www.eip4844.com/) will be implemented first, laying the groundwork for cheap \"blob\" transactions until true data sharding is here. Any rollup adapting to EIP-4844 won't have to do any additional upgrade to be compatible with sharding when it rolls out. Details beyond that are super technical though",

Someone with enough ETH to perform a significant attack would be stuck for weeks/months, which is more than enough time for other validators to notice and slash their ETH.

It's not really *that* big of a deal since you can easily change the endpoint to [use non-Infura nodes](https://ethereumnodes.com/) or run your own node and point your wallet to it. The worst Infura can do in an evil centralized scenario is mildly annoy you by not relaying your transactions to the broader network and force you to take a few more steps to get around it.\n\nThe items on the roadmap to fix this are the ones that will lower the requirements for running nodes. It's easy to say \"just run your own node bro\" but there's still fairly high storage requirements for that, you can't realistically expect the average user to bust hundreds of gigabytes of SSD storage and wait days to sync the whole chain just to swap some shitcoins in DeFi. \n\nSpecifically [light and stateless clients](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o9s15i/impromptu_technical_ama_on_statelessness_and/h3da98p/?context=3) are what's gonna drastically lower the costs of running your own node to a point where an open-source dapp can just bundle a stateless or light client alongside html/css/js files so you can just download it, click start and have the whole front-end running locally pointed at your local stateless node that doesn't use Infura or any other third party node. This would be a win for the user that has very low trust assumptions on the whole dapp and a win for the network as having more nodes makes the network more resilient. \n\nIf you can't tell I'm super excited for statelessness, the nerdy math and technical details behind it are fascinating to learn about if you're into that sort of stuff!",

Some rollups can just do all their accounting in ETH (like Arbitrum and Optimism) where the user still pays fees in ETH, just less of them and they get aggregated on L1.\n\nSo yeah I could view a future where the average user doesn't have to hold ETH or even know what it is, but still contribute to its value and utility indirectly by using rollups and such. But ETH is still the only native asset to the whole ecosystem, used for measuring value and liquidity for everything happening in the ecosystem, so people are gonna hold it for store of value or collateral in DeFi or a billion other use-cases that may pop up in the future",

Creating 1000 different websites and 1000 different YouTube channels is difficult.\n\nYou could also require a minimum amount of staked coins per pool from the operator or (what Cardano does) design the protocol such that pools with more coins staked by the operator receive higher rewards. If someone tries to create 1000 pools they would then have to split their own coins which means that each pool gets less rewards which would incentivize delegators to delegate elsewhere.",

That is translated into less inflation (even deflation) so scarcity which could counteract the theoretical price bound you mentioned.\n\nSecond: the L2 proliferation means more L1 gas usage as L2 is ultimately settled on L1, so even with all the ecosystem in L2, the gas prices will be high, burning and burning eth to increase the scarcity\n\nAnd third, ethereum\u2019s value as income generation asset. Remember that you can get up to ~15% APY (projected after tips are taken into account with the merge) of ethereum by the own staking protocol, that\u2019s added value",

                    "response": "The more Ethereum gets used, either by direct L1 transactions, or Rolled-up L2 transaction, then more Ether will be burnt. This is positive on the price. Supply is going down. So, more usage, higher price.\n\nAs it relates to validators and staking, the less validators that exist and, consequentially, the less Ether that is actively staked in validating, the higher the APYs for the validators will be. This causes more validators to join the pool. As more validators join the pool, that is less Ether that is in circulation, which *effectively* reduces supply. There's also less issuance *per validator* with a larger number of validators, this is important later.\n\nAnd while PoS does cost significantly less to validate transaction, the amount of reward to validators is also significantly less. Currently, we're seeing 5.4M Eth/year in issuance on block rewards, where this be reduced all the way down to 0.5M Eth/year [Ultrasound Money](https://ultrasound.money). Combined with EIP-1559, this will cause a net reduction in the total supply.\n\nThere's an interesting balancing game here actually. If usage of the Ethereum network goes up significantly, we'll see very high burn rate of the supply, which increases the value of Ether. Corresponding, we should see increase in staked Ether, looking for the now higher value of the APY rewards, which, inturn, reduces available supply of Ether more. If Ethereum usage drops again, smaller burn rate, the value of staked APY reduces, causing less stakes, and freeing up some supply of ether again.\n\nI think the Tokenomics are quite sound, personally.",

If Ethereum the network grows to become a backbone of global technology and commerce, Ethereum the token will be in a competitive position as a reserve currency, driving its value beyond just what is required for gas fees or network stability.\n\nThere's also the effect of prestige; if everyone is hearing about the network, and sees strong signals of its importance, that will translate into choosing to invest in the related token.

After the merge it's actually deflationary this year, instead of \"we'll stop inflating in 2140.\" It's a store of value supported by actual economic activity, with fee revenue driving the burn. And with rollups it's scalable enough to actually be used as money at a large scale. \n\nAnyone who thinks bitcoin was never intended to be currency was not around in the early days. There used to be a web page people referenced all the time, talking about how someday bitcoin could manage VISA-level scaling. They gave up on that but now Ethereum has it with rollups right now, without the usability and security compromises of the Lightning Network. Plus the sharding plan is pretty well nailed down, which will get rollups to major-currency scale.\n\nAt some point in this progression, Bitcoin is going to start looking pretty silly by comparison. Maybe it won't be until Ehereum is doing 100K tx/sec. Or maybe BTC won't manage to keep up when ETH jumps up big right after the merge, when suddenly we don't have miners selling half their rewards every month to pay their electric bills.",

It's easy for people to wrap their heads around, 21M Bitcoins, limited supply, fits existing models similar to gold, there's something analogous so it's easier to get people on board.\n\nEthereum on the other hand is a protocol by developers for developers, it's a platform. Guess which platform has the most number developers trying to improve it? Just look at the number of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals(386) vs Ethereum IPs(4895)\n\nBitcoin will never be able to replicate what Ethereum does, every new protocol created that tries to displace Ethereum ultimately has some kind of bridge to and from it, at this point Eth will be the center of the smart contract ecosystem with its fingers in every pie. I would compare Ethereum now to dial-up era internet in the 90's, slow to start but will be the new standard in our day to day lives.",

And be paid 100% of all the mining block rewards for it, which is extremely profitable.\n\nThat's only possible under the preposterous scenario where someone maintains the 51% attack indefinitely. There is no plausible way to do that with a serious PoW blockchain like BTC or ETH because miners need to give mining pools the privilege to hash on their behalf, and they can revoke that privilege at any time without asking permission of the pool. Even if they tried, it is not something the majority of pools could get away with for any reasonable amount of time.\n\nWhereas with PoS and the majority of the stake in the centralized pools, you have to ask the exchanges permission to have your staked coins back, and there's no guarantee they give it to you. Whereas there is NOTHING a mining pool operator can do to coerce a miner to stay on their pool. It's a critical difference that is completely glossed over by people who try and draw some false equivalence between mining pool centralization and exchange staking centralization. Exchange staking centralization is a far more plausible threat because of the control they maintain over that stake, and their significantly higher sensitivity to regulation.\n\nOf course the minority stake could coordinate out of band to ban and slash all of the nodes from the centralized exchanges and redefine the canonical chain amongst themselves, but without the majority exchanges themselves recognizing the validity of that minority chain as being the coin you can trade under the ticker ETH, good luck with that.",

I'll try to lead you in the right direction on this:\n\nTo get current security you can ask: How much is needed to 51%?\n\nWith bitcoin you just calculate how many TH/s you need times your price per TH/s, factor in for how long you want to sustain your attack and your electricity cost for this.In the end that's just a dollar amount. Because of \"economies of scale\" you actually get cheaper price per TH/s the more you buy.\n\nSimilar for Ethereum on PoS you calculate how much eth you would need to spin up enough validators, markets probably would not have enough eth, and the more you buy the more expensive it's going to get so the market is making it exponentially more expensive (opposite of bitcoin).\n\nAfter attack on bitcoin you are left with a large amount of hardware, after attack on ethereum you are left with a large amount of valueless tokens.\n\nIn the end the communities of both chains will probably fork you out and start a chain from wherever people feel the fraudulent activity started, so I don't think these scenarios are realistically a problem.\n\n**It is much more important to look at the long-term security model:**\n\nBitcoin has the \"halving\" every four years, this halves bitcoins relative security budget (how much money bitcoin is spending on security). The idea was that fees would eventually take over and pay for security. This essentially means bitcoin security = fees paid on-chain. As you may know, bitcoin has not been great at earning fees..\n\nThis leaves bitcoin in a scary situation: somehow get people to pay fees (get demand for transactions) or stop the halvings and break the 21 million limit to continue to have a secure chain. Considering bitcoins social consensus seems to be \"don't change anything, keep 21 million\" this is simply not sustainable.\n\nEthereum on the other hand has no hard cap, this ensures ethereum will continue to have strong relative security. With eip1559 and the merge ethereum will end up being deflationary, good for the environment as well as having very strong sustainable relative security.",

(Think of the thousands of individual asic miners needed to control 51% of the hash power and good luck obtaining those plus footing the electricity bill) On the other hand, you have the issue of economys of scale applied to the BTC network where as it becomes more and more difficult to mine BTC, it also can become more expensive and the mining becomes more centralized over time due to increasing expenses.\n\nWith proof of stake, you have the advantage of much lower energy consumption, however you don't quite have the same wall of energy so to say also securing the network. On the other hand, you make it a lot easier for more people to get involved with staking and staking pools, allowing for great diversity of nodes. Additionally, since the footprint is a lot smaller, that can be an advantage in a situation where a node gets shutdown. There's less equipment needed and overall maintenance to get a node back up and running elsewhere.\n\nThose are some of my thoughts, I'm sure someone out there has some more points to expand on for comparisons and contrasts between the two",

It downloads 50 MB of blockheaders and starts crunching the numbers. Syncs within minutes on modern device because it only cares about your own transactions.\n\nSPV wallet will randomly connect with a number of nodes, which are Bitcoin full nodes that run the SPV plugin on to of it.\n\nSo now you have the same situation as with metamask and infura but with SPV it connects to multiple end points at ones ... and if one is down it auto replaces it with another.\n\nIf metamask would work like this then if infurara would not serve you, your wallet would auto connect to the next node. \n\nSo ... the way this is setup with Bitcoin is fairly decentralised. There are some 5000 to 10 000 nodes and I think a good 500 or more run SPV plugin on top of it. Gives you 500 nodes your end wallet can connect to.\n\nMetamask does NOT have this.\n\nAnd to run your own Ethereum node, even in light mode is much more complicated, resource intensive and can take days if not weeks to sync ....",

The \u201calt\u201d coins all made me much more. I had meta mask and didn\u2019t care for it. I am a person who likes to invest in things I understand and believe will be profitable.

But if you think adoption will increase and more utilities will be built on Ethereum, adoption will only go up. Bullish theses operate on the idea of induced demand: as more capacity is built, more users show up to use it. Already we've seen Ethereum's mainnet capacity be completely saturated for about 2 years at this point, so much so that the overflow traffic was enough to sustain scores of alt-L1s, sidechains, and nascent rollups.\n\n> If it's main utility is just as a store of value from a decentralized source isn't bitcoin a better bet?\n\nA SoV is far from its main utility, but I believe Ether under PoS (specifically staked Ether) will be a far superior store of value compared to Bitcoin for at least another 100 years, simply because your Bitcoin holdings will continuously be diluted by miners until the block subsidy runs out (if it ever does). \n\nhttps://mirror.xyz/dataalways.eth/fUBmnyI3Q3KLWzEO7VjQNZzwY_2aTB3AY_7mi99ax2g",

Dropping fees and increasing throughput brings more people into the ecosystem to use DeFi, trade NFTs and tokens, etc. All of that requires Ether and those users wouldn't be doing any of that if fees were high. Also worth noting is that users rarely if ever use 100% of their Ether for fees. So for every additional user you acquire, more ETH is bought and held than is burned on fees. \n\nThe other factor to consider is that gas is not the *only* use for Ether. It has become the base trading pair for nearly all tokens created on Ethereum, it's the only asset able to be used for staking, and it's highly valued as collateral for use in CeFi and DeFi. \n\nAt the end of the day, value is pretty much just a function of supply and demand. Ether is in high demand due to its utility re:gas, but it's also in high demand as collateral, for staking, and for general trading use. Combined with the severe reduction in supply coming with the merge, it paints an extremely bullish long-term picture IMO.",

If I understand correctly with L2's lower fees less gas is being used on L1. I'll put it to you as an analogy I can understand sorry if it's really clumsy.\n\nSay there's this new mode of transportation invented I see it's potential and utility. I want to get in early and the way to do that is to buy this new fuel this mode of transportation uses. The thing is the fuel will actually decrease in value as the mode of transport becomes more and more efficient and a little gas can go further. Why then should I buy the gas right now?\n\nNot a very sophisticated analogy but hopefully it helps you understand my thinking. I appreciate your answer!",

Transport, like financial services, are widely used and frequently used.

It\u2019s literally a an infinite amount of projects that will contribute to the use of this \u2018fuel\u2019. Now think about the fact that you can not only own this fuel (and therefore speculate on its value) but you can also lend it for an interest amount paid in the fuel you are investing in. \n\nNow you have a scenario where you have price appreciation on a interest bearing asset.

Ethereum block space is used to store valuable pieces of data (namely what tokens you own and your transaction history). Ether is the currency used to recognize/actualize the value associated with all that data. Now why does the data have value? It is valuable because applications and use cases are built in the Ethereum ecosystem that allow you to accomplish certain tasks (earn financial yield on tokens, buy an NFT to belong to a community, etc.). So the net utility of applications on Ethereum dictates the value of Ether",

                    "response": "The product of Ethereum is blockspace, not the coin. The coin is just the thing you need to use to buy the blockspace. The value proposition is secure, decentralized, credibly neutral blockspace to settle stuff on it. EIP-1559 automatically adjusts the price of the product based on demand. The blockspace is limited, the demand for it is not. Layer 2 and such helps scaling by using less blockspace for the same end result, but as we've seen with alt-L1s offering low fees, there is a LOT of demand for cheap DeFi stuff. It's not as simple as 1000x lower fees = 1000x less ETH burned. It's more like 1000x lower fees = 1000x more demand as people from cheap alt-L1s flock to equally cheap but more secure/sustainable rollups. Demand is elastic: Lowering the cost means increasing the volume. And the thesis is that in the coming years/decades, the demand will be global and practically infinite and it will be accomodated by rollups batching everything super efficiently and paying a shit ton of gas on Layer 1.\n\nSo yeah, demand for secure blockspace is abundant. The more demand there is for blockspace, the more Ether they pay, which burns Ether and rewards stakers, which adds economic security to the network, which adds to the value proposition mentioned (secure blockspace). \n\nIn addition to that, Ether powers the whole ecosystem. It is the ONLY fully trustless asset in the ecosystem, since it's the native asset. Everything else has some trust assumptions and isn't fully backed by the security of the network (e.g. Tether could easily collapse independently of Ethereum, WBTC has counterparty risk, etc.). Native asset + scarcity = lots of DeFi stuff is backed by using Ether as collateral to take out loans or mint stablecoins and such. The higher the value, the more stuff you can do with it, which adds on-chain activity, which burns more ETH, etc. It's a whole bunch of feedback loops.\n\nSome quick diagrams to illustrate the point:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/mbQ59Kx.png",

NATO decides to whom and when to on board. \nIn what way does onboarding Ukrain improve security of NATO. \nThis is very similar to Cuban situation despite our US fans wanting to supress alternative points. Pointing fingers at Putin seems rather ironic as the NATO folks also need to back off permanently. New [Yalta confrence ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference)where USA Russia China etc settle geopolitical issues may be the way but me is a plumber what can I say or do? \n\nThe world is neither black not white but greys.

There is no question in my mind that US is a great and succesful experiment in democracy with innovation and technology culture. But it's greys not pure lily white.",

                            "response": "Apologies for hijacking the top comment here, just wanted to share some tools and resources that users discussing this topic should really be familiar with. We know that misinformation, online disinformation campaigns and other active measures [1](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html) have formed a key component of Putin's strategy in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine [2](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/11/12/the-grus-mh17-disinformation-operations-part-1-the-bonanza-media-project/) [3](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/01/05/kremlins-shifting-self-contradicting-narratives-mh17/), elsewhere in Eastern Europe [4](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/holgerroonemaa/russia-propaganda-baltics-baltnews) [5](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/18/reconstruction-full-incredible-story-behind-russias-deadly-plot/) and around the world [6](https://medium.com/@ushadrons) [7](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/05/10/thousands-russian-bought-facebook-social-media-ads-released-congress/849959001/) and as such I strongly believe that it is important to equip you with the ability to at least have a chance of identifying and avoiding this kind of manipulation.\n\n\nThere are a variety of subreddits devoted to recording and studying this such as r/ActiveMeasures, r/Disinfo and the sub that I run, r/trollfare. We've gathered a collection of resources on our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/trollfare/wiki/index), the most relevant of which relate to how trolls, bad faith actors and Active Measures agents will try to control and steer an online discussion [8](https://pastebin.com/raw/irj4Fyd5) [9](https://medium.com/s/story/a-field-guide-to-bad-faith-arguments-7-terrible-arguments-in-your-mentions-ee4f194afbc9) [10](http://www.iftf.org/fileadmin/user_upload/images/DigIntel/SR-2002_IFTF_Biology_of_disinformation_tk_042618.pdf).\n\n\nAnd here are some user analysis tools that you can use to check on suspicious accounts:\n\n\n* https://reddit-user-analyser.netlify.app/ is the simplest and fastest user analysis tool that I know of. It provides a list of the top 100 subreddits a user has posted in and their most commonly used 100 words, excluding articles (the/a) and prepositions (in/on/etc.) I think. There are also graphs of their comments and submissions by date. You can use this information to identify users who bolster their reputation in karma farming subs like 'freekarma4you' as well as commonly upvoted subs like 'aww', 'pics', or any popular sports teams. There is obviously nothing wrong with someone posting on sites like that in general, but if an account only posted replies like \"cute bunny\" or \"go ManU!\" for years and then suddenly start spouting exclusively kremlin talking points then you might have reason for suspicion! \n\n\n* https://redditmetis.com/ - Is another site that analyzes a user, similar to reddit-user-analyser but in addition to displaying where and when they post and get karma it also will actually use their posts to extract information they have stated about themselves such as their employment, nationality etc. This shouldn't be taken as reliable as not only can it make mistakes but it also has no way of knowing if a user has lied. Some information has a # link next to it which leads you to the comment from which the information was extracted, this lets you consider context and judge it's veracity for yourself. Another great feature of redditmetis is the activity heatmap, showing when in the day a user posts. If they claim to be from Canada but they only post in working hours Moscow time then that may raise a red flag...\n\n\n* https://www.redditinvestigator.com/ - Similar to the first two however much slower to generate the analysis. I'd suggest giving it a try, although I use it much less than the others. The one unique feature is that it extracts the website links used in submissions to show you if the user frequently links to certain sites. In the context of this conflict look for sites like RT (Russia Today) and Sputniknews being shared a lot.\n\n\n* https://camas.github.io/reddit-search/ - This site lets you search all comments a user has made on a certain sub, within a certain timeframe and/or including keywords. If you wanted to find all the posts made by account X in the sub Y that included the term Z you could do so. \n\n\n* https://redditcommentsearch.com/ - Does similar to the above but with less search options. No fields to limit date range for example, but otherwise perfectly useful. Sometimes simplicity is good.\n\n\n* https://www.reveddit.com/ and https://www.removeddit.com/ - Both of these sites allow you to view deleted comments from discussions, assuming that the comments wasn't removed too quickly. You'll often see users arguing in what appears to be bad faith, spreading disinformation, then when someone disproves their bullshit or calls them out the bad-faith user may delete their comments, so when they try something similar again no-one can see that they shouldn't be trusted. Either of these sites provide you with a counter to these reputation management techniques, allowing you to view and share evidence of previous manipulation attempts that the user may think they have scrubbed from the record.\n\n\n* https://subredditstats.com/subreddit-user-overlaps - You can use this site to compare subreddit userbase similarities, as a kind of meta analysis of what you're doing by just checking profiles and useful if you see a subreddit that you don't recognize or start to see a pattern with lots of accounts posting in a certain sub.\n\n\nI hope that this lot is helpful, we're entering a period where I'm expecting disinfo here to really ramp-up, hopefully by working together we can counter it to a certain extent. Please, please copy and paste this comment wherever you like, especially when you see threads with suspicious accounts. Don't call them out directly as this may get you banned in some subs, and don't reply to them even to argue as the primary role maybe just to derail discussion and therefore crack a consensus that is forming. Instead just post this in reply to the person they are interacting with, or just wherever you like really.\n\nThank you so much for your time, I appreciate that this isn't directly on topic for this sub, and I really appreciate you taking the threat of misinformation and manipulation seriously enough to read through this lot. \n\nMinimalGravitas",

I own Bitcoin and I like it but it's really toxic and annoying. \n\nIf a politician does or says anything positive for Bitcoin they act like they are a hero or a god. Kim Jung Un can come out in support of Bitcoin or China and they would hand their pictures on the wall. It is really pathetic. \n\nThe sad part is most of them don't give a rats ass about Bitcoin, Crypto, etc. They are just grifters who know how easy it is to win your support over. \n\nI am not looking forward to 2022 and 2024 in the USA when people start running Crypto campaigns, and elections are won and lost solely on people's support for Crypto. It is already starting to happen and play out in multiple states including Texas where this absolute psycho Don Huffines is running on a pro-bitcoin agenda, and distracting ppl from his vile stances on abortion and LGBTQ, etc.",

It might be doable for 100B-1T but that's a lot of money to burn in order to bring down an ostensibly global economic network. The current pariah nation states don't have the money to do that, and the nation states that do would be harming their own citizens with such an action (even China). \n\nYou could come up with a hypothetical situation where the US government goes rogue and decides to confiscate Ether from every US-based exchange and then has enough to perform an attack, but that's getting a bit out there. Kraken, Gemini, BinanceUS, and Coinbase's ETH funds combined could probably perform a 51% attack but the global community would see such an attack coming from a metaphorical mile away due to the queue for new validators. The social layer would be able to respond very quickly to mitigate such an attack such that the stolen ether stake is completely destroyed and the attacker is left with nothing. \n\nHighly recommend you read through this, I think it answers most of your questions: https://eth.wiki/en/concepts/proof-of-stake-faqs",

The more people are using and trusting the network, the more ETH is valued and then the harder to pull off an attack is.\n\nBut there will be a turning point when people will say \"Ethereum is secure enough, I am OK to now start putting in real world assets to it\".\n\nImagine if the entire US land and title registry apparatus moved to Ethereum and started using NFTs to track ownership of real estates. The \"locked in value\" there would be insane. It would be much bigger than the value of the ETH coins (marketcap) itself.\n\nSo essentially a lower priced thing (Eth marketcap) would be protecting higher value items (real estate rights). And a successful attack is a factor of the lower priced thing (Eth marketcap). \n\nIt's kind of like protecting a longer password with a shorter one. \n\nEdited: spelling",

You can't create arbitrary transactions or steal from people's accounts in a 51% attack, you can pretty much just undo transactions or execute elaborate and short-lived DOS/censorship attacks. Don't get me wrong, a 51% attack on ETH when the whole world's assets are on it would be a huge mess but ultimately those assets would still be secure and the proper state of things could be restored after the attacker has been slashed into oblivion.",

                    "response": "You gotta remember that the possible attacks are limited in scope. Having 51% of the hashpower or total staked amount doesn't let you steal the tokenized ownership of a $200B company. A 51% attack means a longer fork has transactions that the other fork doesn't (or vice-versa) and allows double spend by depositing on an exchange, cashing out the fiat and then reverting the chain so you have both the fiat and the coins. If this keeps happening, the obvious thing is that exchanges will start making deposits wait for more and more confirmations, making the reorg attack exponentially more expensive the more blocks are required.\n\nSuch a 51% attack wouldn't be useful in a DeFi world. You can swap 1 ETH for 3200 USDC on uniswap, but you can't reorg the chain to double spend. There is no reorg that would leave you with 0 ETH and 0 USDC or 1 ETH and 3200 USDC \u2013 you'll always end up in a \"reasonable\" state of having either 1 ETH or 3200 USDC. Coins/tokens/NFTs sitting in your wallet cannot be affected by any broad attack on the blockchain as a whole. And if we're at a state where ownership of multibillion dollar company is tokenized, I think the sale of a company would just happen with an on-chain payment, making any reorg attack pointless\n\nIf a state actor did a reorg on massive scale just to fuck with the blockchain, there would be the obvious social recourse of saying \"okay then, that fork isn't legit, let's just stay on the old one\" and then that state actor wasted $20B on hashpower for a fork that everyone blacklisted because everyone's interest is aligned in preserving the old one.\n\nOther than that block producers can censor specific transactions or mess with the orders to get MEV, but if the scenario is a state actor that doesn't care about anything other than fuck things up, they'd probably keep producting empty blocks to censor everyone. But even then that just leaves more money for block producers who do include transactions so unless they really do have a large majority of the stake/hashpower to produce block after block, this attack doesn't do much. And that's without the ongoing research into separating block builders and proposers, at which points people who get caught censoring get censored too.\n\nIn addition to what the other guy said about the deposit queue. Once the chain gets to 1 million validator that state actor would need at least 500k to get 33% and mess with finality which would take them a whole year and a half of clogging up the validator queue. 3 whole years if they want to get 1 million validators of their own to get 51%, at which point we might start asking \"where tf did they find 30+ million eth\" lol",

If there's only a few nodes running and a single client implementation, then collusion is easy: update the client with changes the user might not like (like printing coins to cronies) then collude with the few nodes to run that update. Then it's a whole mess to undo this, if it can be undone at all. \n\nWhen there's thousands of independant nodes running, spread out over different client implementations, collusion to push unwanted updates becomes much harder since you have to coordinate that update with a bunch of independant teams. And the honest nodes would refuse the unwanted update (or continue to run the honest version of the software by default if everything evil is happening in the dark) and it'd be trivial to say \"sorry Vitalik but x% of the nodes are running the version of the chain where you didn't print yourself 100k ETH, so we're just gonna sync to their fork instead of yours\" and then Vitalik is left holding 100k worthless ETH on a worthless fork.",

If Ethereum Classic had had an overwhelming community support then Vitalik and the EF would have had to suck it up and officially support that chain. Kinda like how they had to suck it up and adjust the roadmap when it became clear rollups will eventually dominate, otherwise they'd be doing a lot of work trying to make Layer 1 do it all and by the time they're done no one would really care since rollups would offer 1000x more scale\n\nBut yeah devs and the foundation do play a big role in governance for the base layer, which is needed for such a complex and long roadmap and it's rendered less bad by distributing development across dozen different teams all out in the open. It adds coordination complexity but follows the [philosophy of subtraction](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy/) more closely.",

I don't have any insider knowledge about Loopring, but I do have info about other ZK projects, and there's _lots_ of corners being cut across the industry just to get something working out the door.\n\nAnd most things marketed as \"zkEVMs\" aren't actually EVMs, they're just marketing it that way. The ZKSync team even addressed this discrepancy in their talk in Amsterdam yesterday.\n\nAFAIK, Hermez and Loopring are the only teams that have expressed that they'd make a full opcode-compatible zkEVM. While it will be great if they can pull it off, doing an EVM-equivalent ZK circut is extremely difficult, more-so than a normal general-purpose ZK rollup.\n\nFurthermore, Loopring has never been the leader in ZK tech, they even considered switching to StarkWare's tech at one point. So given how hard it has been for the leading projects to advance, I'm very skeptical that Loopring will even be able to keep-up.",

It's a very tricky job andnthats understating it. However, I do have a little snippet of insider info from the EF. \n\nSnipped\n\nI have been told that they are making good progress - no specific timeframe given of course and we all know how easily delays can happen. But it sounds to me like they're reasonably close. My source bought themselves a bag of LRC recently enough.\n\nThe way they it *should* work is by basically building the Solidity code into the byte code of the EVM without any translation, and then run the byte code withinin the zkEVM. So there will be 100% solidity compatibility between L1/L2.\nThat means a dapp/smart contract dev will be able to very easily and quickly port their code over to L2 - should be much easier than using any competing EVM like starkware. Plus you would get the benefit of L1 standard of security with Loopring that no other L2 can provide.\n\nI'm bullish on LRC because they're going to get some significant publicity if the Gamestop marketplace is a success, and hopefully within a reasonable timeframe after this they will bring their EVM to mainnet and have a good chance at attracting other dapps to their network.",

Vitalik was certainly the main driver of the early concepts leaning on many astute technical advisors. If it had been possible, Ethereum would have launched as a PoS chain. At the time, a decentralized PoS was only an idea and had never been implemented. Proof-of-Work was well tested and proven by Bitcoin and simple to implement. Launching with PoW would allow the Ethereum Virtual Machine to start proving its use while PoS was developed. It was originally thought the PoS switch would happen 8-12months after launch, but it became much more difficult than first thought and has been in development ever since.",

There are several proposals approved and under development that aim to move to PoS, some of them were written and voted by Vitalik, but also by the majority of devs.\n\nThen we have a second part, where the changes are released to the public, through a new version release of the protocol. At that point, all the nodes are required to update to the new version, but is up to the every node whether or not they update. It could be a possible scenario that at some point a new version with PoS is released (Eth v2) and some node just refuse to update, and they can even start a separated development (hard fork) which is exactly what happened with Eth Classic (ETC), where the devs decided something that some part of the network didn't agreed, and some nodes didn't update their releases.\n\nSo... it's a mix, the EIP can be written by anybody, the devs vote to implement it, and every single node decides to update or not.",

NFTs also provide royalties depending on what marketplace they are sold on, there are protocols now where you can begin to borrow on your NFTs. You can also get in on the early stages of NFT games(lots of scams).\n\nin 2017 people were buying crypto kitties, then crypto dragons came out and you could feed crypto kitties to the crypto dragons now nfts are coming out to lock liquidity into certain protocols for bonus earnings on your funds depending on how long you lock. Eventually NFTs will be tied to real world assets and there will be a lot of cool things to come from them :)",

A few people here have already hit the nail on the head. The two main things for me are being part of a community and producing supplementary income. I have a discord server where NFT artists and collectors can both get updates on my projects and share what they are creating/trading with each other. The artists share their techniques with each other and support each others' work by purchasing  what they like from each other. I have set up a community wallet where a certain percentage of my profits gets transferred to and then the community votes on what new artists to invest in. I am not making life changing money, this is just something I enjoy doing and other people enjoy supporting my art as well.\n\nArtists have always had trouble selling their work and NFTs seem to be something people have latched onto to finally begin to support artists. I think it all ties into social media as well. Now you have an easily viewable paper trail of your support for an artist. \n\nDon't get me wrong though, it is the wild west out there right now and there are a lot of ABSOLUTE TRASH projects going for stupid amounts of money with zero utility. But think of it this way, people will pay $10-$100 for little statues or figurines to put on their window sills or decorate their homes with and they essentially have no utility and people know that these trinkets are just mass produced in a Chinese factory but buy them anyway. With NFT art you can directly communicate with the artist on discord/Twitter whatever, purchase their art and possibly have utility with that art, whether it's a guarantee that a certain percentage goes to charity, gets reinvested back into the art community, or even can be staked using smart contracts and have a Dao distribute yield to holders. \n\nSorry this is a run on.",

That token contains a text that sometimes is the (generally temporary) address of a file representing an image.\n\nWhy would a BTC be worth anything, exactly? Or Dogecoin? Or ETH? Because people value these tokens. What do they hope to do with these tokens to value them so much? \n\nFor BTC, it's hope the token will at least have the same value in the future and that it's a value that is available nearly whatever happens outside of it. \n\nFor ETH, it's an access to its world wide computer.\n\nFor the most valuable NFTs, it's because it provided an access to a very select community. Like some kind of select club, with virtual and physical meetings and such. The entry price is expensive, so it's only valuable to people who have so much money they don't find much more else to do with it to begin with.",

There is not much reason to respond to their theme without more specific questions. Most of everything they said to downplay hardware wallets was wrong.\n\nNo, i know how they work in concept. One of my hobbies is general embedded work, so other than the deep implementation of the security elements (of which the ledger's is closed source, which is something to worry about depending on paranoia) i don't think there is much left to know how hardware wallets work superficially, even if you are an average person; they have a security element that enables them to sign transactions without the private key ever leaving it, which together with on-device pin entry makes a package that offers great security.\n\nThis post wasn't supposed to downplay hardware wallets, it was just my rationale on why they aren't *that* needed. Of which, funnily enough, you didn't manage to explain in a way that, from the post's point of view, doesn't fit either in the whale (which is an outlier) or paranoid (gimmick) since no elaboration on *why* is it so dangerous for the average crypto user to not have a hardware wallet was done other than affirmations that are to be taken at face value, since other than the big \"i have a ton of assets and stored my seed phrase/private key in plaintext for some reason\" post that happens once in a while, i don't see enough of a security epidemic amongst us to warrant the apparent amount of people using hardware wallets nowadays other than the instances i've listed, which doesn't seem to account for a lot of people in raw numbers other than the gimmick case (there aren't that many whales and people using crypto IRL to warrant that many people using hardware wallets, i think)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I think it's insane to store your private keys on any device wasn't built to wall your keys off. Especially if they keys access accounts that contain value too painful to lose.\n\nAren't most devices nowadays *made* to wall important information off? A ton of crypto users are linux power users and/or know enough about programming and technology to know how to either A: keep their computer secure or B: secure their keys themselves.\n\nBut obviously i could be wrong in my perception (and this is why i made the post: i can't conceive of any other credible situation where hardware wallets are good investments other than the ones i listed on my post) and there may be a ton more not-so-tech-savvy users in crypto than my \"programmer that uses thinkpad and encrypts partition with LUKS\" point of view may enable me to perceive, but this is just a clarification away, not a \"ignore OP he dumb\" response.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I see no downside in hardware wallets. Transaction confirmation is a feature not a bug.\n\nOne of the downsides is the fact that it is a product that you have to buy, that for you may not be a big expense but for some people (such as those that live on third world countries with a weak currency, like me) may be prohibitive and warrant a reconsideration. \n\nAnd continuing, having to confirm every transaction by entering the pin instead of just signing like in Frame may be a feature for you, but it's still an UX obstacle for some.",

I run a micro-business w/3 remote employees. We draft professional reports for building contractors who work with insurance companies ($125 per report).\n\nAfter the merge, I will migrate the business to Web3. My ENS will facilitate the following:\n\n* Integrate DNS w/ENS to decentralize the customer-facing site.\n* ENS monitizes my site for direct customer payments.\n* Will issue subdomains to my 3 employees. This will be the first stage in offering them fractional ownership.\n* Will integrate Ethereum dapp with ENS for push notifications, end-2-end encrypted email, IPFS file storage, manage worker output, & maintain everything as Ethereum native as possible.\n* Will integrate smart contracts with ENS. This is where the real magic starts. SC w/ENS enable me to convert my business into a nested network; on-chain.\n* SC: Immediate payment to employees when they finish an assignment. No waiting a week. SC manages invoices,\n* SC: Allow me to let employees collaborate amongst each other to build customer services. The SC ensures I receive a portion of any value they generate.\n* SC work with IPFS to ensure proper sorting/management of documents.\n* My solidity guy says he can add a SC wrap to ensure proper set-aside for taxes.\n* This enables us to take on more business with fewer producers.\n* Subdomains + dapps + smart contracts underpin the operation's integrity.\n* I plan to monetize the accruing value & distribute it to workers. I want them to carry a financial interest in the growth of the business.\n* Ideally, over the long-term, I want everything to be run on-chain. This way, I can sell it with a smart contract and ensure perpetual royalties.\n\nEthereum is a combined network, marketplace, and platform. ENS will be the first project to fully expand on ERC721's design potential. And that's just the start. Those are the best $40 you may spend in crypto.",

So 25 distinct pairs of clients ran the merge against mainnet (simulating very closely what the real thing will look like) and all came to consensus on a point in time where PoW ended and PoS started.\n\nThere is very concrete progress being done, but there's still more testing to do and more shadow forks to come. Next friday the devs will get on a call and there's a good chance we get an idea of what the final timeline will look like as far as public testnet merges go, and onto the true mainnet merge.",

You can only get the block hash of a previous block.\n\nYou can use the block hash as a (bad) source of randomness by something like:\n\n   * Create bet in block 100\n   * Pay out the bet in block 102, based on the hash of block 101.\n\nThis can be gamed at a cost by the miner of block 101, because if they would have lost the bet they can not publish the block. It can be more subtly gamed by other miners with lots of hashpower, because they could pretend they didn't see that block 101 and instead mine their own block 101.\n\nGaming it this way has a cost to the miner, as withholding a block to avoid losing a bet loses them the block reward and fees. So in theory you're OK as long as the amount as stake in gameable bets is less than than the block reward and fees. However there is no way for you to know either of these numbers in advance: Fees vary from block to block, and you have no idea who *else* has used the block hash in the same way as you, and how much there is at stake on it.\n\nThe timestamp can be trivially gamed by the miner at no cost, they can just pick any number between the time the last block was mined and the time the current block is mined. So block hash is less bad than block timestamp, although they're both bad.\n\nNote that PoS brings in a whole new set of considerations, the plan is to replace the *difficulty* field with a somewhat bias-able random number.",

Letting people mass transfer money out of the system harms them when the value of their currency literally controls how many resources and arms they can aquire. They aren't just getting free support, they are getting deals to pay for it too.\n\nAnother thing that crypto enthusiasts seem clueless about: **a healthy currency should have a small rate of inflation**. You want it to devalue a little bit over time, because it encourages people to spend money and invest, which in turn grows the economy. \n\nObviously you can't have hyper-inflation, but when the value of the Ukranian dollar drops further and further, becuase of people transferring it to crypto or other currnencies -- **that is going to encourage excess money printing**.\n\n> they'll save their central bank \n\nWhere do you think the majority of their citizens have their money? In banks and cash. They are protecting the interest of their citizens too -- especially considering they are in the midst of a war on their own soil!",

Sometimes, in times of crisis, it is necessary for a state to restrict the freedoms of individuals if it means that such an action will help the country survive. \n\nAnd if you all don't understand why the central bank wants to do everything it can to control inflation and capital outflow during a massive war, then maybe y'all should educate yourselves on reality.",

I'm trying to figure out something similar, but the voting stays off the Blockchain in an App until the number of votes warrants it's usage.  I'm trying to ensure that there isn't a financial impact until enough people actually care and avoid having a bunch of short block chain votes of should I eat the red smartie or the blue m&m.  @ op, why Ethereum?  I've considered it as well, but due to the high transactional costs, I feel it might be better to find a way to tether it's vote result to Ethereum without actually having to be high level involved in the ecosystem.  Micro transactions might be a possible solution, but I'm sort of testing the waters here.",

So like instead of one transaction costing $20, you can have a batch that spends $1000 on gas fees for 2000 transactions, or $0.50 per transaction Layer 2, but still $1000 of fee revenue for Layer 1. The idea being that there's way more users willing to pay the $0.50 on L2 than $20 on L1, so it's still added revenue for L1 even if it's less money spent per user\n\nEventually rollups will be the main players competing for L1 blockspace, and they'll have a lot of money to spend so L1 gas fees will probably be super high, contributing to ETH's scarcity (and thus Layer 1 security because proof of stake)",

He spends a lot of his time for charity and is a real friend to most of that go on his show.

He doesn\u2019t care what people think of him and continues to be himself, he is pro crypto and weed and shows it knowingly it causes more harm to his image than not.

They promised it in 2017 and didn't deliver. They'll never release it.\n\nThis is what I see:\n\n* Several iterations of novel distributed consensus research, from Slasher through Casper FFG/CBC to Beacon Chain consensus, the latter of which is powered by a brand new BLS signature aggregation standard.\n\nThis is what you see:\n\n* They literally don't have PoS. It's all vaporware.\n\nThis is what I see:\n\n* A modular Proof of Stake consensus mechanism that's been running in production since November 2020 without any major issues, and that's flexible enough to satisfy the Ethereum network's consensus requirement.\n* Kintsugi, Kiln, and mainnet shadow forks, coordinated across 4+ development teams, leading up to a final production merge.\n\nThis is what you see:\n\n* It'll be impossible to switch over to Proof of Stake, it's like changing out the engine of an airplane mid-flight.\n\nThis is what I see:\n\n* At a predetermined Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD), the system switches from the highly tested and very robust PoW consensus to a highly tested and very robust PoS consensus. The actual \"engine swap\" is completely automatic and will have been tested successfully dozens or hundreds of times using real mainnet data.\n* Also, if we're using the plane analogy, the merge is less like swapping out the engine and more like swapping out the pilot. The engine (Ethereum's execution engine) stays the same.\n\nThis is what you see:\n\n* Ethereum slow and expensive\n\nThis is what I see:\n\n* Ethereum developers choosing not to compromise on the chain's long-term values of security and decentralization for short-term temporary gains in cost and speed.\n\nThis is what you see:\n\n* Ethereum gave up on scaling, left it up to private companies making rollups\n\nThis is what I see:\n\n* Instead of Ethereum's future hinging solely on one idea from a single ivory tower development team, we have a capitalistic, survival-of-the-fittest marketplace for scaling solutions, where priate teams are financially incentivized by free market competition to create the product that scales Ethereum the most efficiently.\n* Instead of focusing on providing scaling, the Ethereum dev team is freed up to focus on the easier problem of providing the tools required for others to provide scaling.\n\nThis is what you say:\n\n* \"I'll believe it when I see it. Until it launches, it doesn't exist.\"\n\nThis is what I say:\n\n* \"I see the code right in front of me. Until it launches, I understand exactly how the system works and at what stage it is in development.\"\n\n*Dear low-information Ethereum critic,*\n\nStop squinting at Ethereum and shouting at me about how blurry it looks. Either put on the goggles or kindly go away. That is all.\n\n---\n\n*Edit for /u/Revanchist1*\n\nThis is what you think of me:\n\n* \"You got lucky! Anyone could have taken that gamble. I was smart enough to avoid gambling in the first place.\"\n\nThis is what I think of you:\n\n* \"It's a real marvel that my calculated investment in this new asset class has paid off. It's too bad that you and the rest of the general public didn't have the specialized expertise in finance and distributed systems engineering to be able to properly understand the risks and estimate the potential rewards of such an investment. I wish there were some way for me to impart my expertise so that other laypeople like you could also benefit from my investment methodology, as it saddens me on some level that this type of expertise contributes towards further increases in the wealth gap.\"",

                    "response": "> From what I understand, before I can use a layer 2, I need to send my ETH to the specific layer 2 and also buy some of their token to pay for gas fees.\n\nYes to the first part, no in general to the second. You need to bridge your assets across from L1 to L2, but the main L2s (Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, StarkNet) just use ether for gas fees, and don't yet have a token that you need to buy.\n\n\n\n> My question is: Do you think I\u2019m the future interacting with a dapp on a layer 2 will be as easy as a push of the button?\n\nThis is already kind of a thing with zkSync running through the Argent wallet, at least as far as swapping tokens around.\n\nFor Arbitrum and Optimism, once you've bridged across the dApps work exactly as they do on L1, just faster and much cheaper. Almost all of the same DeFi platforms are available already, so if you know how to use Curve, AAVE, Balancer, Sushi, Uni, Synthetix etc on Ethereum then you also know how to use them on L2s.\n\nI don't think we'll ever get to a stage like in your scenario where the user doesn't choose stuff manually, because if I've got assets on L1 and multiple L2s I don't want the dApp deciding which of those to use... you'll always have to connect your chosen wallet (think of the security risk if this wasn't the case)... and in the specific example of RocketPool I don't quite see how that could run on an L2, because it's entire purpose is to pool ether for validators on the Beacon Chain. You can buy rETH on rollups, but the dApp itself probably will only work on L1?\n\nYou're asking good questions though. If you haven't tried using rollups yet it's worth giving it a go. In the future basically all normal users will be transacting on L2s, so it makes sense to learn as much about them whenever you can.",

Then you can send the exchange some dollars. Wait 3 days till they are there. Then you can buy Ethereum. Then you can withdraw the Ethereum which only cost like 5 dollars in fees. Then you can buy the NFT with the Ethereum which only cost like 50 dollars in fees or so.\n\nThen you can use the NFT to pay for the haircut which only uses like 50 dollars in fees.\n\nAnd then you can get the haircut!\n\nAMAZING!",

Climate Change is the biggest issue mankind has ever faced, and unfortunately it's what Ian Banks termed an 'Outside Context Problem', something so far beyond what we're used to dealing with that most people are unable to really comprehend it, let alone figure out how to beat it.\n\nSince the beginning of capitalism humans have been largely a one-trick pony with regards to solving problems. Whether the issue has been improving medicine, reducing global hunger, or whatever, the solution has ultimately been 'growth'. By increasing the economy we can fund more research into more medicines and better crops and whatever else. This has unfortunately become something of a religion, the belief that economic growth is the solution to everything.\n\nNow we are facing the physics though, and it turns out 'growth' has been causing a crisis... more economic output has meant more greenhouse gas emissions, pushing our planet towards uninhabitability. At the same time our decision makers are rendered useless with indecision, because the one tool they have relied on up to this point is not going to cut it this time. While our leaders are not leading this struggle, the general population is divided and mislead, distrustful of others and unwilling on an individual or national level to make the sacrifices needed in case other people and groups don't, a global scale 'tragedy of the commons', mixed with jealous concern over the 'freeloader problem' (\"if we give up x to save the world, but 'They' don't, then they get the same benefits as me without having to give anything up, so it's not fair\").\n\nThat's where we are. Things look pretty bleak for human civilization. We need new tools to enable us to coordinate on a global scale to confront what will otherwise be our 'Great Filter'.\n\nWell if you want to keep going down the rabbit hole I'd also recommend the Bankless podcast episode on Moloch:\n\nhttp://podcast.banklesshq.com/33-slaying-moloch-ameen-soleimani-kevin-owocki\n\nAnd once you've listened to that, here's your new favorite podcast series - Kevin Owocki's Green Pill:\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/greenpill/id1609313639\n\nThe first couple of episodes in particular where he inteviews Vitalik and Karl Floersch really set out the vision for how the Ethereum ecosystem has a chance to be the coordination tool that we need. \n\nEthereum is a Schelling point for those who can see that there are big problems to face but haven't given up on the possibility that we might be able to solve them and end up with a future that's better than today.",

That's because they built capacity for the good times.

Without bitcoin miners they could not have financed it.\r  \n\r  \nPOW will be vital for the green energy transition because you need flexible baseload consumers to make it economically feasible. None of the 'Bitcoin is bad because of muh energy' crowd even knows what a flexible base load consumer is, let alone that they can come up with an alternative to bitcoin mining. They come up with things like hydrogen production. You can't just shut down a hydrogen plant within 7 seconds as bitcoin miners are required to do in texas.\r  \n\r  \nThen there is methane gas flaring and venting. It is responsible for ca. 2% of global warming. The potential electricity generation of (just the reported) flare gas is 6x what bitcoin currently consumes. Within 5 years every single oil company on the planet will be mining Bitcoin to meet their climate goals;) For small and/or remote drilling sites Bitcoin mining is pretty much T.I.N.A. It will turn Bitcoin into a net negative emission industry.

Greenpeace demonized nuclear energy and all we got in exchange for it was more coal. So Bitcoin could meet the same faith as nuclear. No problem if you work on my generational timeline but it could be hard to stomach for the average investor.\r  \n\r  \nTo make ends meet in the short term I like to bet on ignorance and evil because those things often win on shorter time lines. Making money of it eases the pain;) This is why I still hodl ETH.\r  \n\r  \nLet's assume the truth prevails. Imagine 5 years from now when all this baseload consumer stuff is clear to the mainstream. How mislead will ethereum investors feel by ethereum leadership (lol) when they realize they squandered their POW USP for a short term price pump based on energy ignorance and half baked ideas about sharding;)",

War isn't only fought on the field anymore. \n\nImagine some authoritarian state pretending to be attacked and recording sophisticated videos to show how much help they need, fast. Given the coordination of some hacks from states between each others, I don't think it's unexpected. \n\nBut the good news is it also means they're becoming more indecisive about crypto future: regulating it too much would simply kill the golden goose, on top of ensuring golden goose thrive more in other states.

With that number, the results are far from representative and probably wouldn't even justify a survey in a single state. No mention either as to how the survey was conducted. Was it online? In person? By phone? By mail? By fax? Maybe they sent smoke signals?\n\nThey don't even show the questionnaire, nor say if they restricted the percentage of respondents for each age range on par with the age distribution in America, and same goes for residence or sex. Were the respondents 50% male and 50% female, just as the sex distribution in America that you would expect for a \"national\" survey? No survey can be trusted if they don't specify how it was conducted. This is the equivalent of toilet paper and the veracity of the facts the same as propaganda.\n\nCarrying an actual national survey about any matter in a country as populated as the US is VERY expensive, which is why governments are usually the few ones taking this endeavour. Having a representative sample of your whole country involves interviewing many elders, and since not everyone uses the internet, big amounts of money go into financing door-to-door interviews. But of course, no mention of that in this study, which affirms to be national, whatever that means according to them.",

At the end of 2021 there were mints happening left and right to capitalize on the mania but that seems to have calmed down a lot. \n\nSince then bearish price action and shrinking DeFi yields have put a damper on mainnet activity, plus a lot of the more \"degen\" activity has moved to Arbitrum. If the current price reversal holds up we'll likely see more mainnet activity and Gwei will regularly be triple digits again.",

Being offline only penalizes you what you would have otherwise gained in the time you are offline. \n\nSecond, it is very important to the network that as many validators as possible stay online so that the network can finalize. If more than 1/3rd of the network is offline the network cannot finalize blocks and will begin the inactivity leak until the validators still attesting control 2/3rds of the stake. \n\nThe difference is because PoW and PoS arrive at the \"longest chain\" metric by significantly different means. In PoW, whoever solves the hashing problems quickest and builds the longest chain wins, period. That's pretty easy. In PoS, the consensus algorithm (Casper for ETH) is more complex and relies on validator votes. It's very important to have a quorum of validators so that the chain can't be easily taken over by a minority staker. At the same time, you can't *always* require a quorum because you also need to produce blocks. So offline penalties and the inactivity leak were introduced. This way the protocol *can* always require a quorum, but it also has a mechanism to penalize offline validators in order to reduce the number required for said quorum and ensure that finality will eventually be reached. \n\nHighly recommend these resources for more info: \n\nhttps://eth.wiki/en/concepts/proof-of-stake-faqs\n\nhttps://upgrading-ethereum.info/altair/",

So, it takes one day of being online to get back to net $0. If you are offline all the time, you keep losing money until all your money is gone.

Imagine an attacker with 30% of all coins. In the current state, he can't do anything since he will be slashed to oblivion if he tries to attack the network. But if he can simply convince 10% of the network to go offline, he can then stop finality. With no cost for going offline, the attacker simply needs to pay the validators art least as much as their block rewards would have been. With penalties for being offline, the cost to attack is significantly increased.\n\nSince the penalties for being offline scale with the number of offline participants, it means that for the averglage user, downtime is no big deal, but if you are not following best practices (using a centralized server to host, like AWS or using GETH, etc) and that service has a bug or downtime, you will be punished far greater because much of the network is affected at the same time.\n\nAdditionally, running a validator requires a fairly substantial amount of capital and it is not something that should be just turned on an off at will. Allowing fair weather validators brings security issues since those validators aren't really paying attention too well. The online requirements really do go a long way towards ensuring that participants are keeping their systems updated and maintained and that they are maintaining security.\n\nPlus in the future you will just be able to exit and re enter later after a small queue, so it really doesn't matter too much",

On chains without utility (smart contracts) this might be true, but for Ethereum and other smart contract chains you have to buy the native asset in order to conduct transactions on-chain. This might be sending stablecoins, taking out a loan, minting an NFT, buying synthetic options, creating a token, running a game, etc. All of those require Ether to process so they can be recorded on-chain.",

Basically, you tell one of the big mining pools that you are about to send a transaction but you set the gas price extremely low. You then pay the mining pool some fiat so that they will include it anyway (miners have full control over which transactions get included). However, this isn't possible anymore because now you have to burn Ether in every transaction. So Ether now really does become more valuable the more Ethereum is used!\n\nAnother point is that Ethereum will soon switch to Proof of Stake, which will drastically reduce the capex and opex of \"miners\" (they will be called _stakers_ then). So, the sell pressure from miners will almost disappear.",

                            "response": "Apologies for hijacking the top comment here, just wanted to share some tools and resources that users discussing this topic should really be familiar with. We know that misinformation, online disinformation campaigns and other active measures [1](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html) have formed a key component of Putin's strategy in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine [2](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/11/12/the-grus-mh17-disinformation-operations-part-1-the-bonanza-media-project/) [3](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/01/05/kremlins-shifting-self-contradicting-narratives-mh17/), elsewhere in Eastern Europe [4](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/holgerroonemaa/russia-propaganda-baltics-baltnews) [5](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/18/reconstruction-full-incredible-story-behind-russias-deadly-plot/) and around the world [6](https://medium.com/@ushadrons) [7](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/05/10/thousands-russian-bought-facebook-social-media-ads-released-congress/849959001/) and as such I strongly believe that it is important to equip you with the ability to at least have a chance of identifying and avoiding this kind of manipulation.\n\n\nThere are a variety of subreddits devoted to recording and studying this such as r/ActiveMeasures, r/Disinfo and the sub that I run, r/trollfare. We've gathered a collection of resources on our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/trollfare/wiki/index), the most relevant of which relate to how trolls, bad faith actors and Active Measures agents will try to control and steer an online discussion [8](https://pastebin.com/raw/irj4Fyd5) [9](https://medium.com/s/story/a-field-guide-to-bad-faith-arguments-7-terrible-arguments-in-your-mentions-ee4f194afbc9) [10](http://www.iftf.org/fileadmin/user_upload/images/DigIntel/SR-2002_IFTF_Biology_of_disinformation_tk_042618.pdf).\n\n\nAnd here are some user analysis tools that you can use to check on suspicious accounts:\n\n\n* https://reddit-user-analyser.netlify.app/ is the simplest and fastest user analysis tool that I know of. It provides a list of the top 100 subreddits a user has posted in and their most commonly used 100 words, excluding articles (the/a) and prepositions (in/on/etc.) I think. There are also graphs of their comments and submissions by date. You can use this information to identify users who bolster their reputation in karma farming subs like 'freekarma4you' as well as commonly upvoted subs like 'aww', 'pics', or any popular sports teams. There is obviously nothing wrong with someone posting on sites like that in general, but if an account only posted replies like \"cute bunny\" or \"go ManU!\" for years and then suddenly start spouting exclusively kremlin talking points then you might have reason for suspicion! \n\n\n* https://redditmetis.com/ - Is another site that analyzes a user, similar to reddit-user-analyser but in addition to displaying where and when they post and get karma it also will actually use their posts to extract information they have stated about themselves such as their employment, nationality etc. This shouldn't be taken as reliable as not only can it make mistakes but it also has no way of knowing if a user has lied. Some information has a # link next to it which leads you to the comment from which the information was extracted, this lets you consider context and judge it's veracity for yourself. Another great feature of redditmetis is the activity heatmap, showing when in the day a user posts. If they claim to be from Canada but they only post in working hours Moscow time then that may raise a red flag...\n\n\n* https://www.redditinvestigator.com/ - Similar to the first two however much slower to generate the analysis. I'd suggest giving it a try, although I use it much less than the others. The one unique feature is that it extracts the website links used in submissions to show you if the user frequently links to certain sites. In the context of this conflict look for sites like RT (Russia Today) and Sputniknews being shared a lot.\n\n\n* https://camas.github.io/reddit-search/ - This site lets you search all comments a user has made on a certain sub, within a certain timeframe and/or including keywords. If you wanted to find all the posts made by account X in the sub Y that included the term Z you could do so. \n\n\n* https://redditcommentsearch.com/ - Does similar to the above but with less search options. No fields to limit date range for example, but otherwise perfectly useful. Sometimes simplicity is good.\n\n\n* https://www.reveddit.com/ and https://www.removeddit.com/ - Both of these sites allow you to view deleted comments from discussions, assuming that the comments wasn't removed too quickly. You'll often see users arguing in what appears to be bad faith, spreading disinformation, then when someone disproves their bullshit or calls them out the bad-faith user may delete their comments, so when they try something similar again no-one can see that they shouldn't be trusted. Either of these sites provide you with a counter to these reputation management techniques, allowing you to view and share evidence of previous manipulation attempts that the user may think they have scrubbed from the record.\n\n\n* https://subredditstats.com/subreddit-user-overlaps - You can use this site to compare subreddit userbase similarities, as a kind of meta analysis of what you're doing by just checking profiles and useful if you see a subreddit that you don't recognize or start to see a pattern with lots of accounts posting in a certain sub.\n\n\nI hope that this lot is helpful, we're entering a period where I'm expecting disinfo here to really ramp-up, hopefully by working together we can counter it to a certain extent. Please, please copy and paste this comment wherever you like, especially when you see threads with suspicious accounts. Don't call them out directly as this may get you banned in some subs, and don't reply to them even to argue as the primary role maybe just to derail discussion and therefore crack a consensus that is forming. Instead just post this in reply to the person they are interacting with, or just wherever you like really.\n\nThank you so much for your time, I appreciate that this isn't directly on topic for this sub, and I really appreciate you taking the threat of misinformation and manipulation seriously enough to read through this lot. \n\nMinimalGravitas",

                    "response": "There's a few key things that are always forgotten by people who say \"no one is gonna want to spend Ether if it's deflationary and always goes up in value\", and you mentioned a few of them, so I'll just add:\n\n1. Ether is not inherently deflationary, it only becomes deflationary when so many people actively use it enough that the burn rate outpaces the issuance rate. There is some equilibrium point where issuance = burn, at which point the supply may very well inflate something like 0.5% every year by issuing 2% and burning 1.5% (numbers pulled out of my ass but you get it)\n\n2. Ethereum's blockspace is what people are after, not Ether. Ether is just the asset you use to pay for Ethereum's blockspace. If you want to use Ethereum, you *have* to spend Ether.\n\nPoint 2 is the crux of my overall long-term thesis for Ethereum and Ether. If you spend $100 on blockspace, then you have to burn $100's worth of Ether on blockspace. You don't do that unless the economic utility you get out of that blockspace exceeds the $100 you spent on it. So as long as Ethereum is in demand, people have to spend Ether to meet that demand.\n\nSo when you're spending $100's worth of Ether on Ethereum blockspace, there's a few ways to do it:\n\n1. Buy $100's worth of Ether at today's prices and immediately spend it\n\n2. Use it from your Ether bag that you bought at a lower price months/years ago, so the $100's worth of Ether you're spending today only cost you $75 back when the price was lower\n\n3. Use it from the yield you got from staking ETH. You put up some fixed amount of ETH in staking and now you're getting rewards essentially for free, and you're spending those rewards on blockspace.\n\nIf Ether is an inflating/depreciated asset, then the best move is 1. But if it's an appreciative asset, then 2 and 3 are the way to go. And in terms of network security, you want the staking collateral to have a high value to make sure attacks are very very costly. So the more people hoard/stake, the more economic value the whole network has, which furthers solidifes Ethereum's selling point as a secure settlement layer to move value around and post any kind of data with guaranteed availability.\n\ntl;dr Having Ether be an appreciative asset is good for the network, its holders, its users, and its stakers.

You run a client that is open source, has been carefully vetted and tested to follow the spec (the core rules of the protocol) so you can be reasonably confident that if the software says the block is valid, then it is valid. (There could still be a bug though, that's why client diversity is crucial and a hot button issue these days)\n\nFor evil users, they will code their own client to fuck shit up and at that point they're bending the rules to make invalid blocks.

How arrogant of you to enact crippling regulations on a technology so new you can barely explain what it is? US Regulations only serve to cripple innovations in this sector and must inevitably lead to our exclusion from the competition entirely.   \nThie \"America Competes Act\" proposition will allow a sole individual to ban exchanges and other financial institutions from engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. The individual that could potentially hold these unchecked powers is none other than the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen. The very individual who has be opposed of the crypto market since her confirmation, this is also the same individual who had the brilliant idea to look into bank accounts for possible tax evasion.  \nIt doesn't just stop there, this would allow Yellen to employ what is called the \" Bank Secrecy Act\" to require certain financial institutions to report information around transactions potentially connected to money laundering, as well as prohibit them from serving account holders with such alleged ties to illicit funds. While the act isn\u2019t something new it would go against the essence of what Defi stands for. While on paper this can be limited to those are under suspicion of money laundering and illicit fund activity we all know how quick this can be used to cover more users and account holders. This can be dangerous considering Yellen would have unilateral power over this sector.  \nCrypto means something different to every individual in communities like r/ethereum to some a hedge against the current inflation, a means to increase personal wealth, monetary freedom and anonymity, whatever the reason is we are all in this together.  \nThis is either a bad joke or a deliberate attempt by the government to weaponize financial institutions against the American people. At this point in the current administration I can only conclude the latter is true.",

I've never spent under $200 in fees to purchase ERC-20 tokens. I understand you said Ether and not its tokens, but is that the only reason? If it's simply a matter of supply and demand and the average is $5, I'd expect for every transaction costing $100 would be balanced with dozens of transactions under $1, right? I'm not saying you're wrong in any way, I just lack enough knowledge to understand how my experiences with tokens (and the general perception that ETH fees are astronomical) can be true if the average cost is $5.

                            "response": "> I understand you said Ether and not its tokens, but is that the only reason?\n\nYeah pretty much, it's not \"average transaction\", it's a transfer of Ether which is more like the bare minimum cost of a transaction. The cost scales with computation, and computation is abstracted with \"gas\". The supply and demand bit comes from the fact that there's only so much gas available in every block, so people outbid each other to use that gas before others. \n\nA transfer of ETH uses 21,000 units of gas. A transfer of an ERC20 requires an interaction with a smart contract which can be around 65k gas, and a swap (probably what you mean by purchasing an ERC20 token) is more expensive at ~200k gas, although Uniswap V3 went heavy on the optimization and my recent swaps have been more like 120k gas\n\nThe USD price is always a function of how much gas is used \u00d7 the cost of each gas unit in gwei \u00d7 the price of ETH in USD. So I got my $5 from doing `21k gas \u00d7 75 gwei/gas \u00d7 3200 USD/ETH = ~$5`. Gas went up and it's more like 150 atm so make that $10\n\nAt the ATH (~$4800) the same 75 gwei transfer worked out to $7.56 and it was even more brutal to do a 200k gas swap at $4800 and 200 gwei (close to $200)\n\nBut also the MetaMask quote is not the total you pay, it's always *up to* that amount. It overestimates both the gas you're gonna use and the cost in gwei of every gas. So for example it could quote you 200k gas \u00d7 100 gwei ($64) but in the end your transaction only used 150k gas at 80 gwei, so you \"only\" pay $38.40 and get the rest refunded.\n\nDon't get me wrong it's still expensive af (even that $5 is too much by several orders of magnitude) but it's worth understanding the reasons and the math behind all that so you can at least plan your stuff more carefully when you do have to do a transaction on mainnet.",

                    "response": "Back with some more corrections:\n\n> Ether isn't meant to be a day-to-day currency that will replace fiat. The use-case of Ether isn't to pay for bread and milk, it's to pay for gas fees and secure the network. All the other use-cases derive from Ether's scarcity, but they're not strictly necessary.\n\nThis hasn't always been true.  [See Vitalik's memorable bag on Bitcoin's failure to scale its L1](https://youtu.be/qPsCGvXyrP4?t=3869), for an example.  At the time, he was pushing for massive scaling of L1, and even had an early Casper toy model showing block times of 4 seconds and throughput of thousands of transactions per second. (Unfortunately I can't find the source video for this, but I remember it being a presentation, and the output was just console output of a cli tool, very barebones).\n\nPart of the original plan [was indeed L2s](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/09/17/scalability-part-1-building-top/), the other part was definitely [L1 improvements via sharding](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/10/21/scalability-part-2-hypercubes/).  Part of the focus on L1 scaling was specifically to enable the \"day-to-day currency\" use-case, i.e. the one in the \"the internet of money\" quote.\n\nThe narrative that Ethereum *isn't* supposed to be a day-to-day currency has evolved *in response* to Ethereum's lack of ability to scale.  This is a direct parallel to the evolution of the \"store of value\" narrative in Bitcoin, which *also* started as a \"peer-to-peer cash equivalent\".  The idea that there are cases that derive from \"Ether's scarcity\" is also a more recent narrative development; this is especially apparent when you consider that Ether wasn't [intended to be scarce in the first place](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/s8mnwb/a_collection_of_various_things_the_average/htkktzm/?context=3).\n\nMore post-hoc rationalization from the community in general.  I mean, it's fine to evolve a narrative over time in response to reality; what's rather disingenuous is to pretend that the new narrative has *always* been the narrative.  Strong \"we have always been at war with Eastasia\" vibes.\n\n> The Ethereum Foundation is more of a coordinator than a dictator. It's much more of a community-focused bottom-up approach than the top-down structure people think.\n\nAgain, see the [Tyranny of Structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm).  All this particular organizational structure has done is replace explicit hierarchies with implicit ones that are only navigable through political means.  Decentralization on this front almost always results in *more* consolidation of power, not *less*.  Again, see also [Vitalik's post on legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html), which addresses the same set of problems from a different angle.\n\n> There is no \"technical debt\" preventing Ethereum from scaling.\n\nThere actually is a good amount of technical debt. The majority of it stems from the focus on L1 scaling early on, presumably due to the lack of actual solutions for scaling the EVM itself.\n\nBut don't take my word for it: [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/sbppnq/what_technical_debt_all_credit_to/hu4860j/) seems to sum up some notable examples.\n\nIt's worthwhile to point out that while \"technical debt is preventing Ethereum from scaling\" is a potent FUD narrative against Ethereum, despite only being partly correct, \"what technical debt?\" is equally vapid.  As a general rule of thumb: anyone trying to come up with clever comebacks to narratives is probably more interested in popularity than in ensuring that people have adequate information to combat said narratives.  If anything, they're probably trying to distract from the valid criticisms that effective negative narratives contain.",

                    "response": "> The security model trumps the economic model. The core idea behind the economic model is, has always been, and will always be: \"Minimum viable issuance to secure the network\".\n\nThis is false.  Specifically, Ethereum's policy has not \"always been\" \"minimum viable issuance\" or \"minimum necessary issuance.\"  The first instance of either of those phrases appears to be early 2019, judging by google search + web.archive.org.\n\nEthereum's original economic policy was \"5 Ether per block, in perpetuity\", with the intent that \"5 Ether per block\" would represent an increasingly small rate of inflation as the monetary base grows.\n\nIf you wish to counter that claim, please find a reference to this concept (hopefully the exact phrase, but an explanation would do) that predates, say, 2018.\n\n> Anyone can propose an Ethereum Improvement Proposal. You just have to convince others it's a good idea to implement it (most EIPs don't get implemented and fall into obscurity) and the clients could just refuse to code it in if it's a very bad idea. The more time passes, the harder it becomes to push changes to the Ethereum protocol and everything converges to the status quo. (This doesn't close the door to further innovation however, as it's still an open platform on which anyone can build)\n\nThis is subject to the [Tyranny of Structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm), and isn't as transparent as it appears on the surface.\n\n> Vitalik regularly gets his proposals blocked by client teams, other researchers, or the community in general.\n\n[citation needed]. To date, I've not seen a single Vitalik-supported EIP get rejected; nor have I seen a single Vitalik-rejected EIP get accepted.  If either of these is a regular occurrence, I suspect this will be easy to provide.\n\n> It wasn't a bailout of Vitalik and his pals, it was a bailout of a huge chunk of the community from an event that could have killed the whole thing in its infancy.\n\nThis is also incorrect.  The biggest voter turnouts were less than [15% of hashrate](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4tffta/hard_fork_voting_and_node_adoption_results/) and less than [10% of coins](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6d62td/the_story_behind_ethereum_classic_etc_and_whos/di3a0ql/).  This is neither a \"huge chunk of the community\" nor (more importantly) a majority of the community.  The implication of this basic fact is that this was indeed a *minority bailout fork*. \n\nIn fact, the *only* deciding factor was which side of the fork was chosen to be the default by the developer-sanctioned clients.  In fact, Vitalik goes on to admit this in his writing about \"legitimacy\", the very one you linked.  The chain that the core developers committed to continuing development on was the \"legitimate chain\", because they lent it their legitimacy.  Let's not forget that the one vote that was supposedly a \"community vote\" that \"determined what the default option would be\" was originally and explicitly called out as *not being an official vote*, with those same developers committing to never treat it as such.  They then changed their minds on this approximately 12 hours before they released the client*s* that would support this fork, indicating that the core developers had already decided *internally* what the outcome would be.\n\nIn a network that cannot achieve a majority quorum of voters, the controlling stake is controlled by whoever gets to set the defaults and deem to be the \"legitimate\" outcome.  In this case, that was Vitalik and a (relatively) small set of developers of the Ethereum clients.  I've [talked about this in depth](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7y166g/on_the_topic_of_decentralized_governance/dud1evl/) when considering the implications of Ethereum's \"opt-out\" governance model.\n\nLet's not forget that [Vitalik was actively buying DAO tokens at the time](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/741832934814949377).  If that's not an economic indicator that he had total confidence that the fork would happen, even before community votes happened, I don't know what could convince anyone.  Economic incentives are what this entire ecosystem is built on, are they not?\n\nAdditionally, the [DAO hack was not an existential threat](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4rohdy/vlad_zamfirs_thoughts_on_the_hard_fork/d52s60v/).\n\n> As far as the initial distribution goes\n\nThis sidesteps the issue that the initial distribution was 100% opaque, and there *were no restrictions placed on insiders buying tokens in their own crowdsale*.  In fact, there's no plausible way [Joe Lubin](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/11/sale-of-the-century-the-inside-story-of-ethereums-2014-premine/) (for example, ctrl+f for his name) could have as much Ethereum as he did without participating in the sale himself.  As a beneficiary of the sale, this allows him to essentially buy Ether from himself during the crowdsale, as no cost (whenever he gets paid back).  In fact, before the crowdsale was even done, the Ethereum Foundation was [already taking distributions](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/08/announcement-on-planned-exodus-withdrawal/) from the Exodus address to \"pay back loans\".  Who were those loans being paid back to?  It's plausible that some of these were loans taken out by insiders to buy tokens in the crowdsale, after which they paid back the loans and kept the purchased Ether.\n\nThis is the crucial difference between an ICO (Ethereum's in particular) and a public IPO: insiders are explicitly not allowed to participate in an IPO because they are the primary beneficiaries of the IPO.  There exist transparency requirements and legal restrictions that prevent double-dipping in IPOs; no such mechanisms existed in the Ethereum ICO.  In fact, from a purely economic standpoint, the beneficiaries of the Ethereum crowdsale would be considered \"irrational\" to *not* participate in their own sale, minting tokens for \"free\".  Given the pseudonymous nature of both Ethereum and Bitcoin, to anyone outside the scheme, their purchases would look identical to participants from \"the public\".  The *only* way to expose such a scheme would be for an insider to reveal the scheme.",

You definitely don't deserve to get downvoted.\n\nIt looks like you're right about minimum viable issuance, I looked up the earliest versions of the yellow paper I could find and it really does just mention 5 ETH/block, with basic sentences about how mining rewards are there to secure the network but it doesn't seem much thought was put in that number beyond the fact that the math worked out that the annual issuance would be 0.3x the public sale (not sure about the causality link though)\n\n>with the intent that \"5 Ether per block\" would represent an increasingly small rate of inflation as the monetary base grows\n\nI know you're not really denying it but it's still worth to note the block time was also gonna decrease substantially as the difficulty bomb would be set off. So that in itself was like Bitcoin's predictible issuance schedule except the block time was the variable increasing rather than the reward per block decreasing. By the time the bomb got delayed, reducing the block reward to 3 ETH/block actually *increased* Miners' overall rewards by lowering the block time and that was the reasoning given in the EIP that pushed the bomb and reduced the reward (the alternative of not delaying the bomb being of course that the network would crawl to a halt with huge block times). Of course rewards didn't jump up to the level they were at 5 ETH pre-bomb, but the point is it was always the case from the start that miners would progressively get less and less due to increasing block time. So the narrative I often see that \"they lowered the rewards from 5 to 3 to 2 just to screw with miners\" is misleading.\n\nBut admittedly this is totally besides the point and not even what you're arguing for. I concede that MVI wasn't as set in stone as I believed, so I'll edit my post to reflect that. The weaker claim is that (like you pointed out) being [disinflationary](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/04/10/the-issuance-model-in-ethereum/) was the policy from the start and they have not shown any intention to change course on that, especially not today when MVI *is* a core policy.\n\n(Some interesting articles I found were [this one](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/) from 2016 that talked about possibly burning fees to avoid security problems. EIP-1559 definitely didn't come out of nowhere!)\n\n>To date, I've not seen a single Vitalik-supported EIP get rejected; nor have I seen a single Vitalik-rejected EIP get accepted. If either of these is a regular occurrence, I suspect this will be easy to provide.\n\nThere are plenty of stagnant EIPs Vitalik has authored that will likely never get implemented. I have to admit my initial claim isn't as strong as it could be, like you I'm not aware of EIPs that have explicitly been rejected, but I also haven't been there from the beginning to know which one he does or does not support.\n\nThe best example I can point out would be a recent one: He authored EIP-4488 and tried to get it before the merge but was veto'd mainly by Geth devs who (rightly) pointed out there wasn't enough time to study the security/economic implications of such a change and now the EIP is on ice despite having strong support from Vitalik and the community (because cheaper rollups).

                                    "response": "> I know you're not really denying it but it's still worth to note the block time was also gonna decrease substantially as the difficulty bomb would be set off. So that in itself was like Bitcoin's predictible issuance schedule except the block time was the variable increasing rather than the reward per block decreasing. By the time the bomb got delayed, reducing the block reward to 3 ETH/block actually increased Miners' overall rewards by lowering the block time and that was the reasoning given in the EIP that pushed the bomb and reduced the reward (the alternative of not delaying the bomb being of course that the network would crawl to a halt with huge block times). Of course rewards didn't jump up to the level they were at 5 ETH pre-bomb, but the point is it was always the case from the start that miners would progressively get less and less due to increasing block time. So the narrative I often see that \"they lowered the rewards from 5 to 3 to 2 just to screw with miners\" is misleading.\n\nIt turns out this is yet another post-hoc rationalization.  As far as the early emission schedule was concerned, the effect of the Ice Age wasn't really considered.  In fact, this whole notion of \"but the Ice Age would reduce issuance\" can only be traced back to the original EIPs (either the first or second) that proposed reducing the issuance in the first place; and it wasn't proposed as a mechanism until after it was pointed out that the issuance was supposed to be constant anyway.  The [original Ice Age mechanism](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/04/ethereum-protocol-update-1/) also mentions nothing about reducing issuance.\n\nIn other words, the narrative about the Ice Age being intended to reduce issuance (or implied to) is [post-hoc rationalization](https://skepticink.com/tippling/2013/11/14/post-hoc-rationalisation-reasoning-our-intuition-and-changing-our-minds/).\n\nReducing the issuance wasn't to \"screw miners\", it was to satiate the needs of bagholders who believed that reducing issuance would increase price.  In fact, the [proposer](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5l9j59/december_roundup_ethereum_blog/dbufcd6/?context=3) of the original EIP [explicitly stated this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/5jem1h/any_eth_investors_know_much_about_github/).\n\nSadly, this kind of historical revisionism is rampant among various proponents of Ethereum, the core devs included.\n\n> But admittedly this is totally besides the point and not even what you're arguing for. I concede that MVI wasn't as set in stone as I believed, so I'll edit my post to reflect that. The weaker claim is that (like you pointed out) being disinflationary was the policy from the start and they have not shown any intention to change course on that, especially not today when MVI is a core policy.\n\nI would agree with the claim that Ethereum was always intended to be disinflationary, but specifically by nature of having a flat issuance rate indefinitely.\n\n> The best example I can point out would be a recent one: He authored EIP-4488 and tried to get it before the merge but was veto'd mainly by Geth devs who (rightly) pointed out there wasn't enough time to study the security/economic implications of such a change and now the EIP is on ice despite having strong support from Vitalik and the community (because cheaper rollups). You could argue it's likely it'll still get implemented (either 4488 itself or something more like multidimensional eip-1559), just not before the merge. But that's one example of Vitalik not getting what he wants. Another one would be removing the self-destruct opcode, something he's been advocating for a long time and never got any real traction and it's still here to this day despite his multiple objections.\n\nThese are fair examples.  We'll see if they don't *eventually* get implemented, but for now they aren't and don't appear to be immediately on the roadmap for inclusion.\n\n> I did. Does your claim about Joe boil down to this one sentence? \"Joe Lubin is rumored to be the biggest holder of ETH to come out of the crowdsale, though he says that\u2019s not the case.\"\n\nMy claim is also based on the ridiculously large amount of Ether (specifically) Consensys has thrown at various startups an incubators over the years.  He also has claimed to other people to be a \"crypto billionaire\" multiple times over the years (including to reporters and such), which would necessitate having hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of Ether at various times.  Getting that amount and not *already being* a billionaire implies that he got it when it was very cheap (i.e. the crowdsale).\n\nMany second-hand sources, but I'd imagine he has plausible deniability reasons for never making the claim on the record.\n\n> Also going down the plausibility hole, why didn't any of them expose it? Especially the ones who have since left the EF and started competing projects. It would be an easy move to go public and hurt Ethereum's credibility if there were any kind of proof or message trail to suggest such a move from insiders.\n\nBecause I imagine the reasons for doing it in the first place largely revolve around obtaining a large amount of money in a tax-free way.  Exposing the scheme would mean exposing their own fraud.  A double-bind, if you will.\n\n> But yeah, the opacity of the ICO does look sus from the angle you bring up, I guess that's the other side of the whole permissionless no KYC sale thing. Still, I would argue the time to worry about the presale being a scam to steal Bitcoin is long gone.\n\nI mean, yes and not.  PoS' entire security model relies on the *current* value of the Ether held; I'd posit that someone who bought millions of Ether for pennies would have far different incentives when it comes to burning it than someone who actually spent billions on similar quantities.  In fact, putting a dollar value on the security of Ether is totally flawed when the price *was* so low so long ago.\n\nThis is especially true given the amount of power that comes with controlling the consensus layer, given that switching to PoS was the plan all along.  What better way to ensure you always control who gets money out of the system than by buying a supermajority of the \"hashpower\" when it was very cheap; if you assume that the price will go up along the way, you end up in an unassailable position.\n\nCouple this with deflationary economic policy and you have a majority stake in the system that literally cannot be diluted away.  Seems rather dangerous.\n\n> For the rest of the points it looks like I have a lot more rabbitholes to fall into, you definitely bring a lot of nuance that I have to look into more deeply and it looks like you've been an informed part of the space for way longer than me. Again, all that stuff is welcome from me!\n\nOne of the advantages to being in the space for a long time is exposure to nuance, complications, and inconvenient truths that many of the strongest proponents would rather have forgotten.\n\nLike the fact that the [DAO fork was never necessary](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/805gcn/vitalik_said_doing_rescue_forks_in_exceptional/duveapx/?context=3), for one interesting example.  When you consider that from a technical standpoint the fork was never necessary, you're left with two plausible incentives to go ahead with it anyway:\n\n1. It carries slightly less risk than a purely on-chain solution\n2. You get to make a shitload of money if you bought a bunch of DAO tokens while the exchange rate was depressed due to the public sentiment.  The redemption rate of the withdrawal mechanism implemented by the hard fork was 100 DAO to 1 Eth; between the hack and the hard fork, DAO were trading at around 100 DAO to .7 Eth, on average.  If you a) knew the fork would happen because you controlled the defaults, and b) were buying DAO tokens while the price was depressed, you'd make a cool, risk-free 30+% profit after the fork.\n\n> It's pretty clear you know a lot about Ethereum's part, so I'm curious about your opinion about its future. Optimistic: yay or nay? And (if I can ask) are you invested in Ether to any significant degree?\n\nHighly pessimistic.  I've been thoroughly divested from Ether for a long time for ideological reasons.  I don't think the core developers in particular have the altruistic goals they claim they do, and refuse to support that by putting my money into the system.  However, at the same time, I think they're running a highly-effective con that just might actually produce something marginally useful through the power of collective delusion.  It also depends on your metric of success: if you think investing in Ether will make you rich? I'd think you're probably right, at least over the short- to medium-term.  If you think it'll actually be a \"revolutionary technology\"?  I don't think it ever will achieve that kind of goal.  At the end of the day, it's just replacing one set of elites with a different one.",

It relies on assuming that there's a) infinite liquidity and b) a billion dollars' worth of demand, neither of which is realistic.\n\nBesides, there are other reasons to burn Ether.  I don't know if they're still a think in the current Casper, but griefing attacks used to be a thing.  Last time it was talked about the status quo was a griefing attack ratio of 1, meaning 1 Ether griefed would cost 1 Ether from the attacker (i.e. both parties burn 1 Ether each).  It seems to me that that might be a more economical way to spend your Ether than selling it, if your goal is to, say, corner the staking market.  Instead of selling it to someone else who might end staking it, you \"spend\" it by deleting a competitor's stake.\n\n>  Also, Vlad Zamfir's comment you linked about why the DAO hack wasn't an existential threat runs directly against that argument.

(Except the EF insider's economic interests are much more Ethereum-aligned than some anon who ran an exploit, of course)\n\nIt's a matter of scale.  The attacker had, in the worst case, 6% of the total supply, not 15%; and even if used in the most optimal griefing attack, there's still ~88% of the total supply remaining left over.\n\nHowever, if they had on the order of 25%?  Probably starts to become a problem, because Ether would become incredibly illiquid if they burned all of their stake.  50% of the total supply in the hands of a single entity is \"infinitely bad\", since they could potentially remove all Ether from circulation (why? who knows?).\n\n> So is it or is it not a big deal for POS security if someone got a lot of Ether a long time ago for very cheap?\n\nDepends on the scale.  10% or less, probably problematic for the market, but less so for security.  20%?  Big problems for both security *and* economics.  30+% is probably at the level of \"effectively have total control over both the market and the consensus layer\".",

That means that there is a lot of transition and migration, especially on the trust, learning \"cliff\", and onboarding front. Just selecting a functional good wallet to participate is a scary thing for most people. During that migration you'll have a variety of what you would call web2.2 and 2.5 and 2.7.\n\nSo I'd say, Reddit becoming a fully-fledged web3 wallet, with some bits of DAO and membership (doesn't matter whether via NFT or whatever) through Community Points makes it a frictionless and more seamless transition for people to feel comfortable participating.\n\nSomeone like Reddit being key to mass adoption is partly why [network theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory) and the [network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) is being more widely applied to assess what's happening on blockchains. Reddit is a very big network, where all can interact with each other. Reddit is literally built open those theories. Give people simple ways towards DAO voting, loyalty & membership, decentralized \"kind-of\" ownership of their subs through someone they trust for years now (that's you Reddit), and magic might happen.\n\nI mean, it's in plain sight. Upcoming blockchains/web3/daos need to launchpad/airdrop/pay you and whatever next to get people in, because they do not have a network.\n\nAdd on top the need for a network, to build a new network the barrier to entry for a newcomer is; choose and setup up some from somewhere wallet, understand addresses, networks, currencies, log on to some websites and connect with that wallet, sign some contracts, and then buy something nao to do anything is ludicrous and full of fear, and it means the participants are still very much early adopters despite blockchains being a decade old by now.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised Reddit knows what they are doing, they generally do, but other networks are also doing it. They just aren't comfortable rolling something out through fear of alienating their customers. Well, or tried and magnificently blew it because they do not understand, that they have to do this as a way to create value for customers between customers (the network). That and don't try to be a predatory man-in-the-middle actor.\n\nI shouldn't drink coffee on weekends and start posting shit, but here I am. Hope y'all are well wherever you are, and have a great day <3  \n\n\nEdit: Obviously not enough coffee so fixed that paragraph",

He doesn\u2019t care what people think of him and continues to be himself, he is pro crypto and weed and shows it knowingly it causes more harm to his image than not.

It's hypothetical and just a pet theory of mine. I'm going to hope and pray that the fees shrink over time such that it doesn't matter, but it costs money to get _onto_ L1, ergo your Ether that sits on L1 has a (probably small) premium in value...mebe",

The others are all sidechains or \"commit chains\" in the case of Polygon, and they have additional trust assumptions when you bridge ETH there. \n\nNow, perhaps that doesn't matter to you, and that's fine! Everyone has different security needs. \n\nThe next consideration is that not every exchange or dApp is on every chain, and in fact very few are on every chain. I recommend you use coindix.com to find potential yield opportunities, and then do more research from there to find out which chain you'll need to use for said opportunity. \n\nThink very carefully about what option you pick! Some of the APY numbers can be misleading and not all dApps are equal in terms of security. I'll be happy to answer any questions you have to the best of my ability. \n\nIf you'd just prefer to use a CEX for yield, research which networks they support and make sure you send your funds over the correct network. Many only support \"ERC-20\" because it's the oldest, largest, and most secure of the networks listed.",

How did said validator get their funds to validate with? So now they have 32 eth to be earmarked as validator. Perhaps they got their funds to buy eth through working at a lumber yard, financial office, or wherever. To go further we should weigh the emissions of the individual as well - gas consumed to drive to work, meat eaten, etc. not an easy task. \n\nI think we must weigh how the eth was procured to validate with, as much as we analyze the emissions of a asic or gpu miner. Sometimes we think the impact is 0 for PoS. Very difficult to do, but just illustrating how the calculations in ones own head should be open. \n\nJust my opinion. Cheers!",

What is the reason to use a smart contract instead of sending the eth directly?\n\nNot sure exactly in your situation, but exchanges often use multi-sig wallets for security reasons. Multi-sig wallets are built on smart contracts that require multiple signatures to send funds. Normal transactions require only one signature.\n\n>2. My Hardware Wallet only shows the eth balance but not the transaction history like I see on my BTC wallet, when I asked the HW vendor about it they answered the reason for this is because smart contract transactions are not a regular transactions and are not supported by the app.After further research I learned that smart contract transactions aka internal transactions are not recorded on the blockchain.if so, how is it still possible to see the balance of my wallet on sites like etherscan.io? where is this balance coming from?\n\nInternal transactions are not real \"transactions.\" I'll try to simplify this as much as I can: smart contracts are code that lives on the blockchain. That code is made up of a series of \"functions\" that can do things like transfer value (tokens, ETH) from one address to another when executed through a \"function call\" by a normal Ethereum address (a regular wallet). These transfers are not necessarily written on the blockchain, although if these transfers involve ETH they will sometimes appear on-chain (requires extra gas).\n\nHow sites like Etherscan see all the transactions is to go through the history of the entire blockchain and check for these function calls (which do appear on the blockchain) and essentially re-execute them to see/verify the result in the corresponding contract (all the code is publicly available). It sounds like your Wallet visualizer doesn't do that.",

Climate Change is the biggest issue mankind has ever faced, and unfortunately it's what Ian Banks termed an 'Outside Context Problem', something so far beyond what we're used to dealing with that most people are unable to really comprehend it, let alone figure out how to beat it.\n\nSince the beginning of capitalism humans have been largely a one-trick pony with regards to solving problems. Whether the issue has been improving medicine, reducing global hunger, or whatever, the solution has ultimately been 'growth'. By increasing the economy we can fund more research into more medicines and better crops and whatever else. This has unfortunately become something of a religion, the belief that economic growth is the solution to everything.\n\nNow we are facing the physics though, and it turns out 'growth' has been causing a crisis... more economic output has meant more greenhouse gas emissions, pushing our planet towards uninhabitability. At the same time our decision makers are rendered useless with indecision, because the one tool they have relied on up to this point is not going to cut it this time. While our leaders are not leading this struggle, the general population is divided and mislead, distrustful of others and unwilling on an individual or national level to make the sacrifices needed in case other people and groups don't, a global scale 'tragedy of the commons', mixed with jealous concern over the 'freeloader problem' (\"if we give up x to save the world, but 'They' don't, then they get the same benefits as me without having to give anything up, so it's not fair\").\n\nThat's where we are. Things look pretty bleak for human civilization. We need new tools to enable us to coordinate on a global scale to confront what will otherwise be our 'Great Filter'.\n\nWell if you want to keep going down the rabbit hole I'd also recommend the Bankless podcast episode on Moloch:\n\nhttp://podcast.banklesshq.com/33-slaying-moloch-ameen-soleimani-kevin-owocki\n\nAnd once you've listened to that, here's your new favorite podcast series - Kevin Owocki's Green Pill:\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/greenpill/id1609313639\n\nThe first couple of episodes in particular where he inteviews Vitalik and Karl Floersch really set out the vision for how the Ethereum ecosystem has a chance to be the coordination tool that we need. \n\nEthereum is a Schelling point for those who can see that there are big problems to face but haven't given up on the possibility that we might be able to solve them and end up with a future that's better than today.",

That's because they built capacity for the good times. Now they are building (renewable) capacity for the bad times and it is bitcoin miners who consume all the energy in the 99% of times they don't need max capacity. Without bitcoin miners they could not have financed it.\r  \n\r  \nPOW will be vital for the green energy transition because you need flexible baseload consumers to make it economically feasible. None of the 'Bitcoin is bad because of muh energy' crowd even knows what a flexible base load consumer is, let alone that they can come up with an alternative to bitcoin mining. They come up with things like hydrogen production. You can't just shut down a hydrogen plant within 7 seconds as bitcoin miners are required to do in texas.\r  \n\r  \nThen there is methane gas flaring and venting. It is responsible for ca. 2% of global warming. The potential electricity generation of (just the reported) flare gas is 6x what bitcoin currently consumes. Within 5 years every single oil company on the planet will be mining Bitcoin to meet their climate goals;) For small and/or remote drilling sites Bitcoin mining is pretty much T.I.N.A. It will turn Bitcoin into a net negative emission industry. The only net negative industry on this planet.https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/26/exxon-mining-bitcoin-with-crusoe-energy-in-north-dakota-bakken-region.html\r  \n\r  \nhttps://blog.upstreamdata.ca/\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.crusoeenergy.com/blog/5t1IxNQ1ZxTDc2OvaBEERn/green-bitcoin-mining-the-big-profits-in-clean-crypto\r  \n\r  \nStill, ignorance can win. Greenpeace demonized nuclear energy and all we got in exchange for it was more coal. So Bitcoin could meet the same faith as nuclear. No problem if you work on my generational timeline but it could be hard to stomach for the average investor.\r  \n\r  \nTo make ends meet in the short term I like to bet on ignorance and evil because those things often win on shorter time lines. Making money of it eases the pain;) This is why I still hodl ETH.\r  \n\r  \nLet's assume the truth prevails. Imagine 5 years from now when all this baseload consumer stuff is clear to the mainstream. How mislead will ethereum investors feel by ethereum leadership (lol) when they realize they squandered their POW USP for a short term price pump based on energy ignorance and half baked ideas about sharding;)",

War isn't only fought on the field anymore. \n\nImagine some authoritarian state pretending to be attacked and recording sophisticated videos to show how much help they need, fast. Given the coordination of some hacks from states between each others, I don't think it's unexpected. \n\nBut the good news is it also means they're becoming more indecisive about crypto future: regulating it too much would simply kill the golden goose, on top of ensuring golden goose thrive more in other states.

What industry do you think is powering crypto mining?\n\nThe truth is, we should be concerned about the environmental impact of **every** industry. You can't demand that only the good parts of crypto be taken seriously and dismiss any of the negative externalities. That kind of bullshit is why so many non-crypto folks roll their eyes about crypto. It comes across as bullshit when the crypto community says crypto is going to change the world, rework the entire nature of money and finance, destroy the entire banking industry, bring financial freedom to billions, yet somehow have absolutely zero negative consequences. There's always some negatives that come along with progress, and when we pretend there aren't we come off as cultists with our heads in the sand.",

Make sure to disable DMs in new discord servers you join, there are inflated fake discord user numbers, discords mods and admins can get hacked and send out links in official channels. Don't move so fast that you forget to take the time to double check. The only surefire way to make money with NFTs is to make your own. Otherwise you need to be early, and sell the hype.

With that number, the results are far from representative and probably wouldn't even justify a survey in a single state. No mention either as to how the survey was conducted. Was it online? In person? By phone? By mail? By fax? Maybe they sent smoke signals?\n\nThey don't even show the questionnaire, nor say if they restricted the percentage of respondents for each age range on par with the age distribution in America, and same goes for residence or sex. Were the respondents 50% male and 50% female, just as the sex distribution in America that you would expect for a \"national\" survey? No survey can be trusted if they don't specify how it was conducted. This is the equivalent of toilet paper and the veracity of the facts the same as propaganda.\n\nCarrying an actual national survey about any matter in a country as populated as the US is VERY expensive, which is why governments are usually the few ones taking this endeavour. Having a representative sample of your whole country involves interviewing many elders, and since not everyone uses the internet, big amounts of money go into financing door-to-door interviews. But of course, no mention of that in this study, which affirms to be national, whatever that means according to them.",

If you stop people in Europe having self custodial wallets, they can't mine privately as they cannot transfer coins from their self custodial wallet to exchange to pay for the electricity / hardware used to mine... This strangles supply immediately and sharply - Prices of cryptos will go through the roof.\n\nAs someone else stated: Unworkable.\n\nTrying to control what you cannot is not time well spent. The reason for this is because if states try to enforce AML (and waste time/resource doing that), they simply force solutions to be engineered that remove AML as a remote possibility. Cryptographic techniques today are far more robust and intelligent than 100% of politicians.\n\n[https://twitter.com/macro\\_diary/status/1508801511454920707](https://twitter.com/macro_diary/status/1508801511454920707) Byron @ Loopring has this right\n\nEDIT: Also AML rules in the EU mean nothing for the rest of the world. Certain jurisdictions outside the EU will have no AML requirements and since you can't prevent self-custodial/peer-to-peer transactions, the whole thing ends up being partial information/unstoppable.  \nAs a case in point about engineers/cryptographers (mathematicians) being way ahead of politicians on this stuff [https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/03/21/garbled.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/03/21/garbled.html) this caught my attention",

Albeit these types of discussions are alarming, it is important to identify here, that the sentiment amongst the younger generations are promising and they are favoring the \"revolutionary myth of cryptocurrency\". So targeting cryptocurrency transers, imo, as an (if) statement, will have minimal impact in the growth of the space because as a whole, crypto is so much more than the sum of controversial agreements. The real challenge, as an individual, is recognizing the bigger trends that have already suggested mass acknowledgement of a \"crypto epoch\". Wagmi",

Short of Ethereum itself going down and deleting all data, everything stored in Arbitrum (except smart contract code, as far as I know) can be recreated, so you should be safe from a worst-case-scenario like that.\n\nThat basically leaves censorship and the actual sequencer node (the Arbitrum node responsible for committing transaction batches from the rollup to the Ethereum network) going offline, bringing transaction processing to a halt. For censorship, I believe Arbitrum has mechanisms in place to force transactions through from the Ethereum network, though unfortunately I don't think Arbitrum has any recourse for the sequencer node fully going offline.",

What good is the ability to mint a DAO to a person who doesn't need to? The big picture is that the fundamental inefficiencies for simple day-to-day transactions don't seem to require the complexity just because it's possible.

Any time they do provide an adequate service, there's no reason not to use it.\n\n>And what do they get by scooping up all of this? Hint: starts with a P.\n\nNot power. At least not coercive power. Otherwise, it's not decentralization anymore. Or care to tell me how they'd force anyone to do whatever they want? Because they clearly have no power to shut down any competitor. At best, they buy at a high premium a manager and lose whatever they've invested in such delirious attempts of getting any sense of control.\n\n>How much you stake affects a variable in the otherwise decentralizated, everybody plays system. That's the point. Aimlessly creating consensus algos just to solve problems created by the lack of an overseer, though?\n\nAffecting and controlling have two very different meanings. For instance, in a chess game, when I'm 1 turn away from losing, whatever I do, and have 3 different moves that would end with me losing, each time in a different way, I can say that I can directly affect what my opponent will do with his next move. Yet, I can't reasonably mean I control my opponent.\n\nThe fact everything affects everything else doesn't mean everyone controls everything. Self-sovereignty is one of the key consequences of decentralization. Or am I to think you're believing otherwise? If so, how?",

As always. \n\nIt's the well known problem of centralization. From time to time you get some efficient management going on from the start of it, that provides such competitive advantages it grows bigger and bigger despite whatever's already providing the service, all while providing pretty useful services to its customers. And as the company grows too big, it can rely on its sheer size to influence states and ensure customers have no choice but to continue using their services or the ones of their very few \"competitors\" of the oligopoly. \n\n>Similarly, many of the other advantages also have to do with better management and organizational dynamics and economics, something again outside the scope of computer science.\n\nUnless I misunderstood you, computer science has already answered this and provided a part of the solution: Numerai offers to people a data science tournament allowing them to offer to their customers the best known solutions to their modelized data problems, all while being privacy-friendly regarding the data. \n\nSo, at least regarding some economic problems, it's solved as best as human beings can (be it directly or through AIs or any other proxy). \n\nAs for the rest, computer science is just a way to generate means of production. It can very well allow for better organizations, for instance, and is already used in such a way by several companies. \n\nOf course, computer science only provides the means of production that are asked for, so if a corporation wants to keep its inefficiency because its deciding entities are part of the inefficiencies, then computer science will ensure inefficiencies are to be kept. \n\nThat's the problem of who decides what to keep and what to change. You can't expect change in such corporations from the inside, unless if you're ready to ensure someone has temporarily taken such a role despite their profit incentives not to behave in such a way. More reasonably, it needs to happen from the outside, as competitors. \n\n>You wouldn't say that merely having a better coded database is a solution to lower morale or uncompetitive wages, right?\n\nIrrelevant. Devs provide features, not code. The code is merely a mean to an end, nothing more. A better comparison would be between the technicalities of codes and the technicalities of centralized economy measures, which would be non sense as you'd expect no one to list any such improvements without being from the very business sector providing these services. Rather, you'd expect people to talk about features, regardless of whether they're provided through code or through any other mean. \n\nAs for your example of uncompetitive wages, it is pretty trivial to envision a code that would try and assess wage competitiveness thresholds. That's because software development really just is a way to generate means of production. \n\n>By the same token, why should crypto be treated as the be-all and end-all magic bullet for the system we have today? \n\nIt's not a solution to all problems. It's a paradigm shift regarding how interactions are coordinated when decentralized. It does solve many problems, but only because many problems actually are mere symptoms of a unique root problem: centralization and its consequences on the dynamics of cooperation. \n\nThere still are many other problems. But the problem of corporations that cripple the economy is directly the consequence of this centralization and its high trust problem. \n\n>How did we arrive at the conclusion that the prime objective is to replace inefficiencies with algorithms\n\nAlgorithms existed for more time than they were discovered and theorized. An algorithm, it's whatever you do whenever you follow a recipe. Be it to start a fire or prepare waffles. The fact it's automatically executed by a computer is irrelevant, except that it allows for extremely cheap execution, rather than relying on scribes and human calculators. \n\nSo, it's much more than about algorithms. Algorithms simply are a way to model a solution to a problem. Rather, it's about alignment of incentives through repeated, trustless interactions. \n\nThere's an entire field of science involved in it. It's called game theory. And it's just as serious and as hard science as any math field can get, despite the word \"game\" involved in its name. \n\n>when it's not the technology that's the real problem, people themselves are\n\nThis is a common pitfall. People aren't the problem. People are what you have. They're the data you're dealing with. \n\nIf you start looking at people as the problem, then you're simply not willing to solve the problem at hand anymore: you're just willing to replace the problem with another one, a simpler one, one where people would behave differently, in a fashion you'd more easily be able to solve. \n\nNo, people behave exactly like they should: they find the shortest path, given all the inaccurate knowledge they have acquired, between them and what they want. Nothing more. That's precisely why it's important to align incentives between people for better cooperation. \n\nThat's also why it's important to never take for granted any official goal of any public entity: they very rarely have any self-interest in ensuring the goal is met. At most, they figure they have to save their reputation and find excuses for whenever the goal isn't met, ideally through a good scapegoat to efficiently divert undesired hate. But not a too complex scapegoat to find either, because it's the shortest path, the lowest effort. It's what's to be expected, if not at first, at least over time. \n\nIf you start trying to build a perfect world for perfect people who don't take the lowest effort or require to have very accurate and dynamic knowledge of their environment, let's be clear: no one has a place in there. I don't. You don't. They don't. No one. Such a place would be an effort in vain. A huge dirt pie.",

If so, please consider the fact devs (or whoever pays them to manage a platform) aren't paid for their past work but rather for their potential future work. The pay is for innovation, maintenance, ensuring features stay up to date and code easily changed to match these new features. \n\nMoloch theory is one that exist for years regarding crypto and decentralized governance, now. Pretty well advertized by their DAO. Whoever wrote it has to consider there's some achievable perfection or something, that you can actually reach the unreachable: ensuring people behave as a perfectly knowledgeable entity.\n\nSushiswap forking uniswap is a big proof that people seem to heavily misunderstand decentralization. You build a platform, but the platform isn't yours. It can be copy-pasted by anyone. What's yours is how you manage it for the future. Anyone can copy-paste your past public decisions. Anyone can do some monkey work of imitation. But no one can imitate what you've still got to do.

They have the very same platform and manage it however they want, with the same fees. Maybe with a way better direction, according to the market, in which case you'd be out competed.

Just to skim a few well known ones - Maker and AAVE are lending and borrowing platforms, Curve, Balancer and UniSwap are decentralized exchanges, Synthetix is a synthetics trading platform and dYdX is a perpetuals trading platform.\n\nI think a great example of the possibilities of DeFi is Alchemix - this dApp lets you deposit ether or DAI, borrow a fraction of it back and then the interest earned on your deposit is used to pay back the loan so you don't have to... this means that you can effectively save and spend with the same assets, which is pretty cool.\n\nAll that above is just looking at DeFi, one aspect of the Ethereum ecosystem.",

What is the reason to use a smart contract instead of sending the eth directly?\n\nNot sure exactly in your situation, but exchanges often use multi-sig wallets for security reasons. Multi-sig wallets are built on smart contracts that require multiple signatures to send funds. Normal transactions require only one signature.\n\n>2. My Hardware Wallet only shows the eth balance but not the transaction history like I see on my BTC wallet, when I asked the HW vendor about it they answered the reason for this is because smart contract transactions are not a regular transactions and are not supported by the app.After further research I learned that smart contract transactions aka internal transactions are not recorded on the blockchain.if so, how is it still possible to see the balance of my wallet on sites like etherscan.io? where is this balance coming from?\n\nInternal transactions are not real \"transactions.\" I'll try to simplify this as much as I can: smart contracts are code that lives on the blockchain. That code is made up of a series of \"functions\" that can do things like transfer value (tokens, ETH) from one address to another when executed through a \"function call\" by a normal Ethereum address (a regular wallet). These transfers are not necessarily written on the blockchain, although if these transfers involve ETH they will sometimes appear on-chain (requires extra gas).\n\nHow sites like Etherscan see all the transactions is to go through the history of the entire blockchain and check for these function calls (which do appear on the blockchain) and essentially re-execute them to see/verify the result in the corresponding contract (all the code is publicly available). It sounds like your Wallet visualizer doesn't do that.",

Smart contract wallets are safer than the typical seed-based accounts you\u2019re used to, especially when you need a wallet to be owned by a group of people that could change over time.\n\n2.

An internal transaction is just a transaction that is recorded inside another transaction. It\u2019s all written to the blockchain. I guarantee you can follow the paper trail on etherscan.",

This strangles supply immediately and sharply - Prices of cryptos will go through the roof.\n\nAs someone else stated: Unworkable.\n\nTrying to control what you cannot is not time well spent. The reason for this is because if states try to enforce AML (and waste time/resource doing that), they simply force solutions to be engineered that remove AML as a remote possibility. Cryptographic techniques today are far more robust and intelligent than 100% of politicians.\n\n[https://twitter.com/macro\\_diary/status/1508801511454920707](https://twitter.com/macro_diary/status/1508801511454920707) Byron @ Loopring has this right\n\nEDIT: Also AML rules in the EU mean nothing for the rest of the world. Certain jurisdictions outside the EU will have no AML requirements and since you can't prevent self-custodial/peer-to-peer transactions, the whole thing ends up being partial information/unstoppable.  \nAs a case in point about engineers/cryptographers (mathematicians) being way ahead of politicians on this stuff [https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/03/21/garbled.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/03/21/garbled.html) this caught my attention",

CEX will disallow self hosted wallet to just keep compliant.

There are many aspects about cryptocurrency that regulators should be trying to understand tactfully. Albeit these types of discussions are alarming, it is important to identify here, that the sentiment amongst the younger generations are promising and they are favoring the \"revolutionary myth of cryptocurrency\". So targeting cryptocurrency transers, imo, as an (if) statement, will have minimal impact in the growth of the space because as a whole, crypto is so much more than the sum of controversial agreements. The real challenge, as an individual, is recognizing the bigger trends that have already suggested mass acknowledgement of a \"crypto epoch\". Wagmi",

Short of Ethereum itself going down and deleting all data, everything stored in Arbitrum (except smart contract code, as far as I know) can be recreated, so you should be safe from a worst-case-scenario like that.\n\nThat basically leaves censorship and the actual sequencer node (the Arbitrum node responsible for committing transaction batches from the rollup to the Ethereum network) going offline, bringing transaction processing to a halt.

FTX also let's you withdraw straight to arbitrum.\n\nI'd also recommend getting a hard wallet, but again if it's \u20ac50 per month I'd really just recommend leaving it on an exchange for now.\n\nYou can also just withdraw to Arbitrum and bridge it to another L2 if you don't want to keep it there, fees aren't going to be huge, but could be a few euro which would eat into your stake, so again, I'd probably just let it build up a bit if I were you.",

It means that when you want to withdraw cryptocurrency from an exchange to an on-chain address the exchange needs to verify that the address you're asking it to send those tokens to is one that you actually control. I'd actually like a feature like that to make sure I don't accidentally withdraw my tokens to the wrong address, frankly.\n\nOnce you've got it into that address you can do what you like with it. Send it to someone else, run it through Tornado, whatever. Though of course then *you* might be breaking other laws, so it'll be up to you to either follow them or cover your tracks well enough.",

Did you wonder why there is so many tax loopholes for richs ?Crypto today is not use only by a small group crypto enthusiasts, it's use by peoples and institutions that matter (give \"gift\") to politicians too.   \nPlus like others subjects it started to become politically sorted around the world (by this I mean that 5 years ago neither the right and left cared about crypto one way or another. Now the right say crypto==good and the left say crypto==bad both in the hope to get 0.X percent of single issue voters that love or hate crypto)\n\nI read part of this paper and I think this regulation is about KYC on services (exchange, crypto-atm, maybe even DEX, etc) and KYC of the wallet address they interact with.\n\nIs it useful for their goal of stopping crypto-terrorist laundering money ?  \nNo, it just add one step like the first address they will interact with will have to be somehow KYC. If it apply to DEX like I think so, I am pretty sure you will see some DEX pop on TOR or stuff like this. Or services that allow to make fake KYC (imagine paying an African 10$ to use his/her identity for KYC). If they cannot solve the issue at the exchange level right now having one more KYC level will not change anything.\n\nIs this enforceable ?  \nWell, maybe. I don't think many crypto have the ability to KYC wallets address. And it doesn't specify who have to do this, it just specify it must be interoperable between service. It could be done by the services (for example if coinbase know 0x000001 belong to Vitalik if binance ask who's address  0x000001 belong to then coinbase will answer Vitalik). It could be done by the network (for example via a smart contract on eth)\n\nLike it's doesn't reach their goal by itself what's the next move they will make ?  \nIt's maybe a first step to make crypto do that and then (in few years) force them to only accept transactions only between KYC address.  \nOr alternatively their real goal is to be able to track due taxes more easily.\n\nHere is my message for the politicians:  \nInstead of focusing on crypto for the money laundering and terrorism by making regulations that don't solve the problem can you focus on your peers ? Donald Trump received money from a terrorist dictator called Valdimir Putin. Nicolas Sarkozy received money from a now dead terrorist dictator called Mouammar Kadhafi. They didn't need crypto. How many of you launder money with your terrorist friends ?Do you need crypto ?  \nYou are corrupt and obsolete. Code is law.",

He was, in other words, a spy.  \nThey want cashlessness.  \nThe point of this illustration, is there are many high level defense people working directly in Google and Facebook, they're actively colluding to bypass the 1st amendment and to weaponize tech monopoly and banking through Operation Chokepoint, and narrative construction to create the foundation to later censor people and deplatform and debank people just like the Canadians and Russians.

It downloads 50 MB of blockheaders and starts crunching the numbers. Syncs within minutes on modern device because it only cares about your own transactions.\n\nSPV wallet will randomly connect with a number of nodes, which are Bitcoin full nodes that run the SPV plugin on to of it.\n\nSo now you have the same situation as with metamask and infura but with SPV it connects to multiple end points at ones ... and if one is down it auto replaces it with another.\n\nIf metamask would work like this then if infurara would not serve you, your wallet would auto connect to the next node. \n\nSo ... the way this is setup with Bitcoin is fairly decentralised. There are some 5000 to 10 000 nodes and I think a good 500 or more run SPV plugin on top of it. Gives you 500 nodes your end wallet can connect to.\n\nMetamask does NOT have this.\n\nAnd to run your own Ethereum node, even in light mode is much more complicated, resource intensive and can take days if not weeks to sync ....",

The \u201calt\u201d coins all made me much more. I had meta mask and didn\u2019t care for it. I am a person who likes to invest in things I understand and believe will be profitable.

Download wallet.coinbase.com. This is an external wallet unrelated to Coinbase Exhange.\n2. Set up the wallet and click receive, and select Ethereum. Get your Ethereum address. Which starts with 0x.\n3. Go to ramp.network and buy ETH (on Arbitrum). Should be small enough to test, but large enough to beat the fee.\n4. Send to your Ethereum address on your Coinbase Wallet.\n\nIt should be visible in your wallet after confirmation. Note this isn't pure ETH and on a side chain, but should be a good test. Try sending this to binance and back again as well. Make sure it's the binance tokens on the correct sidechain (Arbitrum). I believe it's up but search for it first. Good luck!",

There's still a bunch of stuff to fix on the scaling and UX front. But once that's done, using a centralized solution will seem dumb like reinventing the wheel: Why spin up a whole database? Why pay to secure the server it's hosted on? As a user, why should you trust that the person running the server/database isn't shady? If you do trust them, they still need to get paid to at least cover hosting/maintenance fees which ends up being covered by the user at the end. And even then they can't guarantee 100% uptime, not even AWS can. And then whatever they offer only works on their platform unless additional work is done to integrate with other people's stuff.\n\nBut with the end goal of Ethereum as a blockchain, the infrastructure will already be in place. A secure, open platform that you can use to deploy anything and have it be composable with stuff that's already there. Global source of truth and all that, only pay for what you use, no required third party in the middle unless they provide tangible value over community alternatives from DAOs and what not that directly connect you to your customers. And everything's composable, you just deploy your NFT to have it do whatever and then it can already be integrated in the thousands of DeFi options, of which OP listed some examples.\n\nPlus all the backend will be open and verifiable which by itself would be a huge improvement over the current model we have. Of course not everyone will verify everything themselves, but that doesn't mean it's a pointless endeavour: it'll basically be the same trust assumptions as open source software in general. I mean, it *is* open source really.\n\nAgain, we're not there yet, this list of buzzwords of 100% uptime trustless decentralized doesn't currently outweigh the benefits of centralized options, gas fees are still an issue and not worth it in a vast majority of cases. But that's basically the end game once scaling and UX painpoints are a thing of the past.",

I think if the NFT actually gets tied to ownership, licensing, copyright, etc... it starts to get way more interesting.  I also think that NFTs are the key to opening up secondary markets in a digital space (collectables).  However For most of the examples you put in I really think the only reason any one wants to be involved in NFTs is for the hype.\n\nSome of your ideas are kind of insane though...  Remember NFTs are only valuable because some people with too much money are willing to pay for in a dick measuring contest...\n\nWhy would some one accept a NFT for their work in say R&D, or support instead of cash?\n\nCustomer Cohort NFTs\n\nOne of the airlines did this with their air miles programs, like 30-40 years ago, offered life time air miles cards... they ended up in a lawsuit with a couple of them because of how much it was costing them to give them such preferred treatment... Also if this is such a good idea why does it need a NFT? why aren't companies doing it now as part of their preferred programs?",

I used geth on a test net and was able to transfer funds around. I am capable of backing up the account file but it is not clear how or if geth can handle any of the DAPs(suspect no since they all want me to link metamask or coinbase[and using coinbase for everything sort of defeats my purpose, which is to hold my own crypto]). \n\nI am not completely blind so I can use zoom to see about 1 word at a time but I am not going to read more than a couple words that way. \n\n2 years ago, almost all of the wallets I found were Java or Webviews. Both of which were developed by people who were obviously looking to ship _something_ and were not expecting people with disabilities to use their apps. But now I see that this subreddit has 1.2M members and I know that about 10% of the people in the world have some sort of visual impairment so I was hoping there was an easy answer that I had over looked.\n\nIf you are asking specifically, I use VoiceOver on a Mac or iPhone(fight me, it is what I know and works about as well as NVDA on windows...

Infact the only important dApps I use that aren't on a rollup yet are AAVE and Alchemix. Everything else: Curve, Balancer, Synthetix, dYdX, Lyra is on at least one.\n\nI'm sympathetic to your point about ENS names, but really how often do you need to buy or re-register those...?\n\nFor DAOs the majority of governance just involves signing transactions, so no fee and so again it can stay on L1 (though the POAPs you might get for attending meetings etc. will be on the XDAI sidechain).\n\nAnd as for NFTs, you literally listed ImmutableX as one of the places you buy NFTs... which runs on StarkWare's L2!\n\nIt sounds more like you've decided not to like rollups for some reason and are letting that bias cloud your view of reality. You can't do everything on L2s yet, but the extract of your comment I quoted above is just factually wrong.",

It's the immutability and verifiable security that need to be guaranteed, not to mention the consensus algo's which are amongst the hardest things to solve. Besides money/token transactions there is a lot of interest from industry for ssi, data verifiability (imagine iot devices like for example  trackers in shipping containers posting to a dif sidetree which via l2 gets recorded on ethereum network so the data becomes ownable and verifiable, untamperable, there are a lot of anti fraud applications of decentralised blockchain)\n What i'm seeing now is a lot of shit around permissioned chains etc but it's bs imo.

But yet, when they enable their roll-up, that gives our smart contracts the full security of Eth regardless of the Matic network's possible point of failure. Plus, bridging is coming to Harmony and Cosmos, so if polygon goes f up then we can just move our contracts elsewhere.\n\nCentralization sucks but it's necessary for scaling at this stage in the tech, especially for developers who need the bandwidth. At least poly is not a walled garden, and they do provide a valuable service for side-chain computation to write on the main chain (which, faster cheaper computation is desperately needed until The Surge, and still useful after). If they push off their Zkrollup functionality too long then that becomes a power grab red flag though, but i doubt this'll happen given their recent investments.",

Once the wallet is connected and they're on the page, the page could easily be structured in such a way as to prompt them to approve a signature or transaction, at which point the web app could become malicious.\n\nBy itself, I'm not aware of any way to exploit a wallet purely from a connection.\n\nFor what it's worth, from a dev and user experience perspective, I wouldn't make the wallet connection a requirement.

The result is an (x,y) coordinate pair, which constitutes the public key.\n\nEssentially, the zero key asks the system to multiply the base point by 0, which gives the zero-point on the elliptic curve. This is the point at infinity in the projective representation of the curve, which has no representation in the usual (x, y) coordinates.\n\nSo it's mathematically impossible to construct a readable public key from the 0 private key, and it's excluded by fiat from elliptic-curve cryptography.\n\nI don't know how the ethereum system generates 0x3f17f1962B36e491b30A40b2405849e597Ba5FB5 from the 0 private key, but it probably involves a fallacy somewhere along the way.\n\nFrom https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8cgl9a/comment/dxes4hj/",

Passwords are more like an id and applications are in power of whether to let someone in. That allows extra mechanisms to recover forgotten passwords, add location based security (are you logging in from unknown device), etc. Whether one considers some of these security weaknesses- they are highly used features today.\n\nSeed phrases simply don\u2019t have the same feature set. If you loose a seed you\u2019re done.\n\nSure one can argue that whoever looses it is at fault. But majority of people don\u2019t know how to handle even passwords properly (create easy to guess passwords, write them on a notepad, save them in a file on desktop, etc) and without proper care for this the adoption will never grow.\n\nThankfully the beauty of crypto is that people who are extremely security conscious will still have the option of owning their security. But something needs to be done so that the rest can use it as well, without being at a huge risk of loosing all their assets because of a single mistake.",

And sure, either the wallet company or your friend could get hacked, but the chance of both of those things happening _at the same time and by the same hacker_ is very tiny.

Once you are comfortable with managing your own assets you should get a hardware wallet and do some test runs. Then you can be your own bank and minimize the chance of loss due to human error (being scammed, sending to wrong addresses, not using secure 2FA, using wrong blockchains, accepting bad contracts to name a few).  Most people will tell you to get a hardware asap but rushing this stuff without learning how to secure everything correctly can lead to mismanagement and bigger problems than leaving it on a reputable exchange. Everyday someone posts about installing bad firmware or giving access to a scam contract or simply losing their seed phrase because of bad backup policies and negligence.  So basically do your own research and congratulations on your first step towards financial freedom.",

Note that currently (pre merge) the ETH2 you would have on coinbase is LOCKED, you could not change your mind until Coinbase enables ETH2 trading. \n\nYou can also stake on RocketPool which has some advantages but would require you to transfer your ETH off Coinbase and take custody (and full responsibility) of your funds. This would mean getting a hardware wallet set up (or a less secure software wallet) and transacting with RocketPool via metamask (or another wallet interface). It\u2019s more complex for new users and would incur some heavy L1 fees but you would be in full control of your funds and staked ETH on RocketPool is tradeable (not locked). \n\nI\u2019d recommend sitting tight on Coinbase for a few weeks/months while learning more about how to self custody your funds safely and decide if you are comfortable with it. This is the Wild West, there is no customer support.\n\nOnce you decide, then you should stake either on Coinbase or RocketPool if you are thinking medium to long term (6+ months)\n\nOne more step down the rabbit hole: If you, like many others, learn more about DeFi along your journey and want to experiment further, you will want to learn about Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions as well. The biggest current L2 platforms are Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon (with other ZK based L2s coming soon) - if you move your funds into self custody, you can \u2018bridge\u2019 some of those funds to these L2s and explore DeFi for pennies per transaction rather than potentially $100s on ETHs base layer 1.\n\nIt\u2019s still very early so the L2 experience can be clunky and most projects are in beta so don\u2019t put your life savings in there, but it\u2019s also very exciting once you\u2019re up to speed and see the power of being your own bank.\n\nGood luck and welcome to Ethereum!",

They're big, which means they have increased security for their assets while being a prime target for hackers at the same time.

A hardware wallet is only compromised if its private key gets known.\n\nIn theory, a hardware wallet is the most secure option as it can only be hacked if you leak the information. However there are people who would be better off keeping everything on an exchange.\n\nThe question is : Do you trust yourself more than you trust Coinbase?",

I guess that's partly a community thing, but mostly a more fun and easy way to donate and express support.\n\nNFT's can also be utilized as tickets, like the GET protocol (and, in case you're worried about transaction costs, this is perfectly suitable to run on an L2 or sidechain).\n\nOf course many NFT's will be rubbish, just like most souvenirs people buy on a holiday.",

A few people here have already hit the nail on the head. The two main things for me are being part of a community and producing supplementary income. I have a discord server where NFT artists and collectors can both get updates on my projects and share what they are creating/trading with each other. The artists share their techniques with each other and support each others' work by purchasing  what they like from each other. I have set up a community wallet where a certain percentage of my profits gets transferred to and then the community votes on what new artists to invest in. I am not making life changing money, this is just something I enjoy doing and other people enjoy supporting my art as well.\n\nArtists have always had trouble selling their work and NFTs seem to be something people have latched onto to finally begin to support artists. I think it all ties into social media as well. Now you have an easily viewable paper trail of your support for an artist. \n\nDon't get me wrong though, it is the wild west out there right now and there are a lot of ABSOLUTE TRASH projects going for stupid amounts of money with zero utility. But think of it this way, people will pay $10-$100 for little statues or figurines to put on their window sills or decorate their homes with and they essentially have no utility and people know that these trinkets are just mass produced in a Chinese factory but buy them anyway. With NFT art you can directly communicate with the artist on discord/Twitter whatever, purchase their art and possibly have utility with that art, whether it's a guarantee that a certain percentage goes to charity, gets reinvested back into the art community, or even can be staked using smart contracts and have a Dao distribute yield to holders. \n\nSorry this is a run on.",

Because people value these tokens.

As long as the concert chooses to let you in, or the law chooses to recognize your property then you are all set. The only real difference is that these two examples require one centralized entity (concert venue, and government) to recognize it. NFTs have the option for multiple entities to recognize them without any difficulty. Additionally, they can be used and traded with decentralized programming (smart contracts). \n\nThese technical differences might seem small but they have created an entire new concept of ownership. We're seeing mass experimentation with this and while the results are sometimes bad (eg buying/selling tweets), we've also seen a ton of successful concepts (online communities based around collectibles). It's just getting started.",

But everyone will know that dollar bill isn't the real deal, because it doesn't have all the security features of the real dollar bill (etching, hollographs, paper texture, etc) - so your fake dollar bill is worth nothing.\n\nThe same goes for NFT art. Your jpeg doesn't have the same features and inherent value as the real NFT you bought. \n\nMore technical: when you remint your screenshotted jpeg, the mint address will be different from the main NFT art collections mint address. It is very easy to compare the two and find yours is not part of the actual NFT collection. \n\nMore philosophical: at the end of the day, NFT art* and paper currency are all valuable because we agree they are valuable and there is a perceived want to have more of each. \n\n*and when I say NFT art, it doesn't generalize to ALL NFT art but specific ones that people deem valuable.

There is no \"original\" image, that concept doesn't apply to digital files (squences of 0s and 1s). The NFT is a statement, saing that X account and Y image are together (not even so, more like an url to Y image). The NFT is unique. The image is not. If you download the full image from whatever is it hosted into you can totally make another NFT of it with exact same parameters, except that the new NFT contract will be deployed to a differernt address than the oldNFT contract.\n\nThe dollar bill comparison is misleading, as physical things can have the property of strict uniqueness unlike digital sequences of 0s and 1s (images). Two NFTs referring to the same image are said to be different because they're deployed to two different addressess, not because they're \"unique\" in any way.\n\nWord salad for non technical people, and a bubble about to burst imo.",

He spends a lot of his time for charity and is a real friend to most of that go on his show. If something bad happens to someone he knows he cuts out personal time, take a plane and go find them and make very thought out gifts. People interpret his laughter as fake and it became a meme, but people can\u2019t accept he actually laughs that way and most of the time he is actually having a laughing. He doesn\u2019t care what people think of him and continues to be himself, he is pro crypto and weed and shows it knowingly it causes more harm to his image than not. I watch/hear him only when doing laundry and enjoy the stories I learn about his guests, which is the purpose of talk shows: learning that these VIPs are regular human beings, just like all non-redditors :D",

Just plug the RPC URL into Metamask and you're ready to go :)\n\nhttps://www.pokt.network/ Also offers free endpoints if you aren't doing a crazy number of transactions. Worth adding as a backup!\n\nBut of course the best option is to run your own Ethereum node and point your RPC to that:\n\nhttps://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/\n\nAnd this site has info on the popular RPC endpoints: https://ethereumnodes.com/",

So like instead of one transaction costing $20, you can have a batch that spends $1000 on gas fees for 2000 transactions, or $0.50 per transaction Layer 2, but still $1000 of fee revenue for Layer 1. The idea being that there's way more users willing to pay the $0.50 on L2 than $20 on L1, so it's still added revenue for L1 even if it's less money spent per user\n\nEventually rollups will be the main players competing for L1 blockspace, and they'll have a lot of money to spend so L1 gas fees will probably be super high, contributing to ETH's scarcity (and thus Layer 1 security because proof of stake)",

Make sure to disable DMs in new discord servers you join, there are inflated fake discord user numbers, discords mods and admins can get hacked and send out links in official channels. Don't move so fast that you forget to take the time to double check. The only surefire way to make money with NFTs is to make your own. Otherwise you need to be early, and sell the hype.

You basically got repeatedly scammed by trying to get yourself scammed. \n\nIt\u2019s like you got mugged for all your cash while you were on your way to some convention where you were going to throw it all away in a Ponzi scheme or something. Like damn sorry that happened, but this money was lost anyways\n\nI would recommend you not to do anything else in this space but buy btc/eth, for a while at least. No offense but this whole thing was just a large series of horrible short sighted decisions built on top of a completely misguided thesis, I think it\u2019s time to take a break and examine your judgement. Why did you want this nft so bad in the first place? did you really think you can get an instant 30,000 for a 150 \u201cinvestment\u201d?",

To attract proportionally even more players from a pool of potential players that keeps diminishing, you'd need tons more of effort than beforehand. \n\nFor such a P2E game to allow for continuous profit, you'd need more profitable activity. An activity that would probably be more in par with what we'd call a work. And even then, the effect of proportionality would kick in at some point if demand for this work's result is completely satiated by players.\n\nWhat I'd expect from P2E games, it's to allow more than just P2E aspects and actually allow for an interesting gaming experience rather than just being some sort of collectibles.",

Then, if it hits the target of 15M gas consumed (half of the block max size), then it increases gas price for the next block. If it doesn't, then it decreases gas price for the next block.\n\n>What happens if the current block is full when someone tries to make a transaction?\n\nIt's not how it happens. People create transactions which are broadcasted to nodes which broadcast it to validators (nowadays miners) in the mempool. Then, validators add to the block they're trying to create the transactions they want from the transactions they can add. Creating a block bigger than 30M gas ensures it's an invalid block, so validators stop before that.\n\nYes, on the L1, Ethereum NFT transactions are transactions like any others. It's just messages. Some take bigger time to compute or bigger space once computed, that's all. \n\n>I recently discovered that rather than Bitcoin transactions being damaging to the environment, its actually the creation of Bitcoin blocks that are behind the CO2 emissions.\n\nWell, to be more accurate, it's the security of Bitcoin that requires to mine. And that security is a parameter decided by the network: it's the very BTC issuance per block that sets how much profit miners get and thus how many miners will be attracted to the mining activity, up until mining difficulty becomes so high it becomes less profitable. \n\nSo, yes, blocks can be empty and thus the number of transactions doesn't impact how many new blocks are created. For Bitcoin, it's one block every 20 minutes.",

Gas is purchased with ETH. \n\nSo, every time someone sends USDC on Ethereum, they use ETH to do so.",

But 100 gwei burns 10x more ETH as 10 gwei, regardless of USD prices.\n\nOn the other side of the equation there's a constant stream of ETH being issued regardless of how much gets burned.

For example a certificate of authenticity as you said, for the government or for a job application will need said company to accept it. They will need certain policies to apply. Who's gonna apply those policies? When? Will they at all? Why should they even give a \\*\\*\\*\\* in the first place?\n\nThe million dollar question is \"why should they accept it\"? They have no responsibility to do so, and it's not like it makes things easier considering the current system is well established. Same with tickets, same with pretty much everything. The standards would need to change for that to become a reality and that's a whole other problem. Essentially the moment we speak, right now NFTs are a solution looking for a problem.\n\nIf a police officer stops me on the road and asks for my licence can i show an NFT to prove it's mine? Will they accept it? Do they have any responsibility to do so? We say NFTs are the future and at the same time when someone asks about practical there's nothing but words and theory and hype and FOMO.\n\nWords are easy but i don't see anyone hurrying up to make them actually usable in the real world. All i see is companies/devs doubling down on Art/Music NFTs and the people who buy them don't even care about the Art/Music. They just get told it's something \"special/limited/deluxe\" and they think they can resell it to make more money than when they bought. It's just another stock.\n\nIf NFTs were the future there would at least be some form of effort to make them applicable but there is no such thing because no1 with the knowledge and expertise cares, they are just another digital investment. Perhaps im just too cynical but this is what i see right now and i don't see it changing.",

I'm currently lightly invested in a project on the Algorand chain that sells tokenized (NFT) shares of real estate that the company purchases using some algorithmic AI. I get like $2/day in rental income and everytime I hit $50 I reinvest it for another share of a property slowly increasing my daily rental income.

Google \"Ubisoft NFT announcement\", there was so much backlash and hate against it they nixed the idea all together and the CEO came out and said something like \"you guys just don't get it!\". \n\nUnfortunately what we have here is a product people want to make money off of but that may have little to no uptake in the market.\n\nEdit: I just did a quick search for \"NFT\" on r/gaming and literally the top thread is about boycotting ANY company that puts ANY kind of NFT into their game.

You could implement something like a put/call with a few lines of code instead of having to hire a hundred c++ programmers who will integrated such stuff in a heavy old mammoth.\nOf course they are right - Ethereum is a much better tech then Bitcoin, you can do on Ethereum way more stuff.\nThe reason why we should listen what they have to say is because all others who don't trust crypto might trust those assholes, thus they have a strong influence on the public acceptance and usage of crypto.\nFor me it's enough to read the headline, besides that I'm with you to not waste to much time on listening what they have to say. They are lying all the time anyway.",
