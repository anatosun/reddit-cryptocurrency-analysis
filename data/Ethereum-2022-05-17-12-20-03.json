            "selftext": "Please let me preface this by saying PoS is a *technical* improvement beyond PoW. It allows the network to use significantly fewer resources in mining. This is good because it doesn't require the energy requirements of a small country to maintain the network.\n\nThat said, once it interacts with the real world and economics it is no better than Proof of Work.\n\nProof of Work is based upon a numbers game of who has the most hashing power while proof of stake is based upon a statistically fair game of whoever has the most crypto. Each nominal unit of coin has equal odds to be picked for its wallet to be the next miner. One stipulation of PoS, however, is that the wallet must be online. To be online, it requires resources (hardware, electricity, and internet connection). Resources have a real world cost. Due to the fact PoS doesn't require you to fight with hashing power, the energy cost and hardware costs don't rise with odds of being chose to mine the next block (the mining lottery).\n\nBecause of this, larger stakes, have a cheaper cost to mine than smaller stakes. To illustrate this fact, imagine you have a PC in your house with 1 ETH and your neighbor has an identical PC setup in his house but with 2 ETH. The energy requires to run the two setups are exactly the same and the overhead hardware are the same so the cost to run each of your mining operations is the same. However, your neighbor has 2x odds you do since he has 2x more ETH. Since each block will offer the same mining reward regardless of your stake size, the expected value (odds*payout) for each unit of ETH is the same, you and your neighbor both have the same expected EV. However, because those machines have a cost to run, their profitabilities are different. Your neighbor has 1/2 the cost per unit of production, as you.\n\nGiven the fact that the larger stake holder ends up with a larger profit margin, as a rational investor, he would keep more of the mined ETH to increase his production ability. So a larger stake holder would grow his ETH stake faster than a smaller stake holder.\n\nAfter a point, the cost of being part of the mining operation would be too high relative to the payout for small stake holders and they would rationally drop out of the mining business, taking their wallets offline.\n\nThis leads to centralization of mining and the rich get richer, faster.\n\nThe alternative would be for smaller stake holders to band together and move all of their wallets to a central service then share all mined ETH and running costs as it would reduce the per unit cost of the operation.\n\nThis is called economies of scale. We saw this early on in Bitcoin. The difference with Proof of Stake is that it would require all of the smaller holders to put their stakes in the same location. This creates a vulnerability not only to hacking but to outside jurisdictional force such as regulation, taxation, etc.\n\nSo one way or the other, PoS will lead to centralization the same way PoW does due to economies of scale. While it does end up reducing the energy cost to run the backbone of the network to a fraction of what PoW requires, it ends up introducing a significant amount of new risk which cryptos aren't designed to handle (i.e. outside regulation and jurisdictional control).\n\n**EDIT**: Just to clarify, this isn't an issue of comparing one person with 100 ETH and the guy next door that holds 200 ETH. It's more like the guy holding 100 ETH compared to Staking business next door that's holding 100k or 1M.\n\nThe cost difference in operations *does* end up making a massive difference.\n\n**EDIT 2**: Thanks to /u/Miffers (below) for the link to the other thread.\n\nSo only 250 validators will be allowed (unless the devs can figure out a way to open it up to everyone, later on)\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4yuerh/how_will_casper_select_validators_and_avoid/\n\nSo yeah, Vitalik and Vlad *know* PoS is going to lead to centralization and worse, centralized pools. I wonder if they're considering the risk they're exposing from outside forces.",

It can still be a profitable business but the overall margins have fallen over the decades.\n\nBTC's mining margins are only being maintained by the constantly rising price.\n\nSince mining in PoS will be significantly easier to do than PoW (since it doesn't require extremely specialized hardware), the margins will get squeezed to where the large operations end up doing the best.\n\nThe returns will drop like a rock to where it'll be just a handful of players. This is even more true since the amount of work and time required to scale operations is very minimal. Most of the cost is simply obtaining more ETH.\n\nPoW scaling requires more equipment which takes time to fabricated, build, and install. PoS scaling simply requires buying more ETH and sticking it in the node (maybe spinning up another cloud server).",

The only situation in which that would be true would be where ETH protocol itself sets the staker reward very low, like way sub-1%. Even if the rewards are 1%, and mining is so friction free that everybody stakes, the returns will be 1%. If only half the people stake, the returns at 2%. I bet in reality the risk and overhead of staking will lead to maybe 20% of ETH being staked, so you could get 5% return. Nice free market action there to find that point.\n\nI wouldn't call 1% a \"rock\" bottom return in this age.",

It has to do with economic scaling nothing else. This time, the means of production aren't ASIC boards, but rather ETH itself.\n\nWhile I am fine with a small group of whales running the backbone, it is still centralization at its finest.

PoS does allow small production holders to be competitive by banding together in consortiums/co-ops (call it what you want). But this banding will end up creating a new risk that PoW doesn't face.\n\nRemember governments don't normally attack single rich people (because they have an economic incentive and ability to fight back).

Therefore public market investing may still produce a better return without a lock-in period (which is important for non-rich who require liquidity more than return). If RobinHood didn't exist, then I'd say it'd DEFINITELY be for the non-rich but RH makes moving into and out of the market costless (since liquidity isn't an issue at the levels we're speaking).\n\nTherefore it's competing with equity market returns.\n\nThough it could exist as part of a replacement to bonds in a person's investment portfolio (if the risk and price volatility aren't too high).",

That is false for several reasons: 1) while it is true that larger pools may have tiny increase in their profit margin compared to smaller pools based on fixed price of staking, the difference in profit margin is NO WHERE EVEN CLOSE to the difference in profit margin for large POW mining pools compared to small POW mining pools.  So yes, while this is a small centralizing incentive, POW is far worse in this regard.  2) you are ignoring people's incentive to stake based on their expectations for what it will do to the token price.  Token price has a huge impact on mining rewards in POW and POS.  So even if there is a small difference in  profit margin when looking at revenue streams between large pools and small pools, if people believe that decentralization benefits from many small pools will help to support the token price they have a strong incentive to do so.",

Remember finite supply in bitcoin is just a hope that all costs of network security can be paid by taxing users of the system instead of coin holders.  This is completely unproven that this is possible without dramatic drop in price - look at what's happening today with bitcoins crippling transaction fees -   Users could just leave for a cheaper chain.  Anyway- the point is that of course prices will fluctuate and mining in either POW or POS can prove to be unprofitable especially if token values are falling.  With regard to centralization incentive, however, the incentive to stake is based on expected reward from 1) POS mining rewards and 2) impact of decentralized staking on token price.   If people believe that by staking in small pools it helps to support the price increases in the price of the token, they absolutely have a rational economic incentive to do so",

It's basically the heart of politics and something I've pondered for a bit with no definitive answer (just a gray one). \n\nIt all comes down to the mechanism that answers the question \"who determines who gets what?\". A \"decentralized\" system with no central authority to mandate a specific distribution of the pie, by definition does not guarantee equal distribution - in fact it is a vacuum that is left open for someone or some people *to* take power. Markets are free but they also concentrate towards the strong, whatever the parameters are in that system (computational power, connection time, stake, good looks...). \n\nOn the other hand, a system with an authority that dictates the \"fair distribution\" (ok, no competition, everyone will get X...) will be egalitarian in a sense....but is in effect also centralized. That power can be abused as we have seen through history. A paradox. So, which one of the two is actually \"decentralized\"? (IMO that is a matter of semantics and what level of the fractal you look at -- and that's why we should look at \"decentralization\" as degrees on a spectrum, and something to be balanced - not in absolutes)\n\nI would be curious to know what in your mind would be the best solution to that. Btw google vitalik's medium post on decentralization and give that a read. He has some very good perspective. Also you might see if you can start a discussion with vlad if you have a technical improvement.",

See this spreadsheet. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ecdbTXd1n7j970YRuhiyiny3ej6dXUEYmkTHDVcRpIc/edit#gid=0\nAlthough it's a couple of months old, so their might be additional changes that need to be made. This doesn't change your main point though.\n\nSecondly, it is possible to make a stake pool that is 100% decentralized on chain. Yes, at some point a (or a set of) real physical nodes will have to sign prepares and commits, and those are vulnerable to interference. It can be set up to be impossible for a stake pool to steal your money under any circumstance (at worst the validator could behave badly and get slashed). \n\nIt's also possible to have a stake pool that requires 2/3ds (or any fraction) of participants to sign the commits before they become valid. In this case, every pool member has to effectively run their own node, but there is no centralized node operator who can cause everyone to get slashed. Between these two, I don't think stake pools are as risky as you imply they are.\n\nFinally, the cost to run a node and stake is not just the cost of upkeep on the node, but also the opportunity cost of keeping your ETH locked up in the casper contract or a pool contract. I suspect that this cost will outweigh the node cost for most people with a lot of ETH. For instance, if staking ETH gives you a 2% yearly real returns, someone who could use that money to get 3% real returns is losing money by staking ETH. Now, this opportunity cost is dependent on the individual and their situation, 2% might be the best they can do. I'm speculating here, but rich individuals generally have better investment opportunities then people with less income, so the rich might be priced out of the stake market before the average person is!",

Between these two, I don't think stake pools are as risky as you imply they are.\n\nBut it's likely that any formed pool will require participants to stay online or not be awarded any of the payout (or there's an incentive to be part of the pool but NOT stay online). Being online is what produces the high cost factor unless they all share the same physical server.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the pool is decentralized on the chain if the physical hardware running the pool is decentralized as well. This isn't an on-chain issue, but rather a problem in the physical world, not electronic one. The chain runs the same on 100 computers as it does on 10 but 100 computers costs 10x more.\n\n> Finally, the cost to run a node and stake is not just the cost of upkeep on the node, but also the opportunity cost of keeping your ETH locked up in the casper contract or a pool contract.

The rich look at risk vs reward (more so than poorer people). If ETH holds a consistent price (or matches inflation), then that 2% is likely to be *significantly* lower than other investments.\n\nThe poorer people are the ones that will likely drop in favor of other investments. The ability to manage larger portfolios means you considering risk vs reward more than overall growth.\n\nRemember most private funds don't really do any better than index funds in overall returns much less risk vs reward.\n\nMost rich people would take 2% risk free over 5% with risk any day of the week.\n\n",

The cost to run a node is small, and the marginal cost might be even smaller if you're using the hardware for something else as well. A lot of people already run nodes altruistically. I mean hell, people run BTC nodes altruistically and those are a much bigger PITA. I don't see how the physical cost to run a node could drive so many people out of the market.\n\n>Most rich people would take 2% risk free over 5% with risk any day of the week.\n\nI don't see how being net long (or short, for that matter) on any cryptocurrency counts as a low risk investment.

Think of a datacenter versus 100 regular desktop computers. The datacenter will be more powerful. \n\nWhereas in PoS, $1,000 worth of ether at stake spread across 100 nodes is equivalent to $100,000 worth of ether at stake in one node.

Further, having a large stake in the blockchain, by definition, means that you have more to lose if your nodes are faulty and verify false transactions, so people will still only put in what they're willing to lose in the event that their nodes are compromised.

However, that's a pool. But if you pay a security person to do it, it's less for one person to do all of them for 100 people to all learn it and do it individually.\n\nThat said, the point of the post was to illustrate that PoS *will* move towards centralization regardless of the timeline (though I think it'll be a LOT faster than it took bitcoin).\n\nI was just pointing out the only way to keep it from being centralized to just a handful of whales operating nodes (like what happened in bitcoin) is for individuals to form pools and wanted to show the risks associated with that.",

There is a very small economy of scale for very small stakers, as you've illustrated, but it pales in comparison to the economies of scale of large PoW pools where there is a time race to mine each new block and very large incentives to be hosted in a high-speed datacenter environment. In PoS the necessary hardware to run the staking node is quickly put to noise for even a moderate staker. (Especially given the run up in price, while computing hardware and networking costs stay constant.)\n\nSo I disagree with your thesis. PoS is not a perfect decentralization, but it is way better than PoW.",
