If people find out you have made an investment and they haven\u2019t made that investment, they tend to fall into one of two buckets. They will either invest with you and root for that investment to succeed, or they won\u2019t invest and root for that investment to fail. The reason they want it to fail is because they will feel bad for not investing themselves if it succeeds. In the case of friends or family, these are very conflicting options. On the one hand, you don\u2019t want to see an investment take off without you. On the other hand, you don\u2019t want to see someone you care about lose money. So the best option for them is to convince you to sell so that neither of these undesirable outcomes can come true.",
