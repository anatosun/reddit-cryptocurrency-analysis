As the [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/knowledgebank/what-is-legal-tender) says:\n\n> It means that if you offer to fully pay off a debt to someone in legal tender, they can\u2019t sue you for failing to repay.\n\nBroadly speaking this is the meaning but more technically in the UK (and I\u2019m no expert at this) I believe that a debtor must make a \u201cpayment into court\u201d of a sufficient amount in \u201clegal tender\u201d to allow them to use a \u201ctender before claim\u201d defence against a creditor seeking payment via the court. There are [suggestions](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part37/pd_part37) that this might not even apply unless the debtor has no bank account and cannot write a cheque to the court. It\u2019s all rather unclear.\n\nIn the UK at least it has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not it is accepted as payment for goods and services. In fact, most transactions are performed using private digitial money which isn\u2019t legal tender rather than the Government\u2019s legal tender (i.e. notes and coins).",

For the people that actually know what they're investing in won't care. Trading bitcoin for fiat is like trading a bar of gold for paper(fiat) its literally the most unproductive thing to do with your wealth. Bitcoin preserves wealth and can be used as a medium of exchange. Its completely leaving our corrupt economic system and entering into a people run economy. Trading back to fiat is just counterproductive to anyone that wants to obtain and preserve wealth. Might as well just trade stocks at that point.",

You need to chemically test it if you are doing it right. At least every bullion buyer needs to do that when buying your gold.\n\nWhich is also why they often pay you far under spot, as they have to make the costs for the testing.\n\nYou don't need to verify Bitcoin as it cannot be counterfeit.",

Therefore, when I say I have a disagreement with The DIVISIBLE checklist, it\u2019s because \u201csmall pieces\u201d is a very subjective statement, and not because I don\u2019t believe BTC is easier to break down into smaller values. \n\nI believe that After all this fuckery with our money is over, Gold and especially Silver will be revalued to a much higher fiat value. At the time of this post, Russia and other countries are considering GRAMS and MILLAGRAMS as a divisible form of Gold. As I said, DIVISIBLITY is a subjective and weak argument. This also bolsters Gold/Silvers portability \u201cissue\u201d. \n\nI 100% agree that BTC is superior in portability when compared to metals in a digitally dominant age, but it is by no means inconvenient for anything practical, especially if it were revalued. Lastly, when it comes to SCARCITY, there is a growing argument that there is more Gold on the planet than Silver. We don\u2019t know the bottom line scarceness of Metals or BTC, but we have a lot better idea how scares BTC is. Yes we know 21m BTC bla bla bla. But how many were lost? We don\u2019t know. How many will continue to be lost? We won\u2019t know. But we WILL be a lot closer to knowing the total availability than anything else. Silver on the other hand is used in medic and electronics, among other things. We \u201cburn\u201d and literally consume Silver. There is also a growing argument that Silver could become more rare than Gold. \n\nJust some food for thought. Apple uses silver in their phones. If they wanted to make sure they could keep building their phones and control the cost, they could buy all the mined and unmined silver 5 times over. They could corner the market on silver. I encourage everyone to look into these points/ do their own research on these ideas. \n\nWe are living in a very fun times in which many truths have been hidden from us. As things come to light, it happens gradually and then suddenly. Don\u2019t be surprised if within 10years metals will have 10X\u2019d + \u2026 peace and love fellow bitcoiners. Keep stackin them Sats. \n\nTLDR: 1DAY 1USD = 1SAT",

                    "response": "I think you are trying to think of these properties in some kind of ultimate theoretical conceptual terms. But these properties that you list are *required* for something to be money. The fact that fiat is universally used as money is itself proof that by definition it meets all of these criteria. If it ever stops meeting the criteria -- e.g. out of control inflation caused by printing money (reduction in scarcity) -- then it will stop being used as money. Here are some thoughts:\n\n\"Durability\" is a physical property. But you talk about purchasing power to classify fiat as non-durable? The point of \"durability\" is that your money won't dissolve in water or melt in direct sunlight or something like that.\n\n\"Fungible\" simply means that a unit of the money is interchangeable with another unit. This is true of all three. E.g. 1 pound of gold is equal in value to one pound of gold. $1 USD is equal to $1 USD, 1 BTC = 1 BTC.\n\n\"Track record\" is a bit missing the point -- the point is that people need to trust in the currency in order to use it. Doesn't matter if USD has a bad track record in the past as long as people trust it enough now to accept it as a payment method. \"Trust\" is really the more important property, and it is something that can ebb and flow.\n\n\"Scarcity\" -- scarcity of fiat is controlled by a central bank, that doesn't mean it isn't scarce, it means that the scarcity is under human control. Bitcoin is also artificially scarce, but the mechanism is automated instead of human-controlled. \n\n\"Verifiable\" -- just because Bitcoin is better at being verified doesn't mean the others aren't verifiable. And the nice thing about fiat is that you can have very straightforward methods for verifying that even a kid can understand, as well as more complicated/hidden methods only verifiable by a machine or trained eye , as well as super-secret methods only known by the central bank.",

Gold loses there obviously.\n* Verifiability: you got it. Tho gold might be better than fiat in that realm.\n* Scarce: agreed.\n* Track record: agreed.",
