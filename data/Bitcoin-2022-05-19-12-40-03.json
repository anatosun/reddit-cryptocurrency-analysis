Now it predicts a price of something like 200k-2million for 2024-2028 and we\u2019re saying it\u2019s obviously not even gonna fall under than entire huge range. If we end up at 200-300k in 2026 I\u2019m sure everyone is gonna be saying the model is useless because it\u2019s soooo obvious that Bitcoin would be *somewhere* between 200k and 2 million. \n\nThere\u2019s tons of legitimate criticisms of S2F but calling it useless because it accurately reflects the absurd amount of volatility in Bitcoin\u2019s price action shouldn\u2019t be one of them.",

If you are as aware of the term standard deviation, as you seem to be, you should realize that this kind of deviation from the (predicted) average is quite standard. Standard is also normal. As long as we're not in a 3 to 4 sigma event, I am not getting worried. The 100k average price between now and 2024 seems a very reasonable projection imho. It is a theoretical model, and in no means a predictive model, its time resolution is surely a problem if you have a 6 months investment horizon. I guess we'll have to talk in 2024 again to see who was mostly right about this. The S2F model or you, stating that S2F will be wrong by a million dollars per bitcoin by 2025 (you claiming btc will be lower). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe absolute magnitude, in dollars, of its jumps is irrelevant we are two 6x events away from reaching more than 1 million. Do you remember BTC going from 1000 to 20k in 2017 (20x)? Or from 3k5 to 12k in 2019 (3,5x)? Or from 5,5k to 40k 2020 (7x)? Since then it has been roughly flat through 2021 and 2022 so far. If we do a linear extrapolation, we're bound to get there by 2024, and that is a vast underestimation as the graphs follows an exponential trajectory and not a linear one.",

I just don't like when people give up making reasonable arguments and start shouting and exaggerating.  That's where discourse breaks down and I stop learning from you.\n\nDo you really believe what you said about 99.9999% confident?  Would you make a 1000000:1 bet on it?  Probably not.  How about 2:1?  Probably.  Maybe you already have done so.  That would represent 66.666% confidence.  How confident are you, really?\n\nAlso, is there a reason to disparage those who disagree with you?  Do you think that will change their mind?  Does it make you more certain?  I personally want to hear your opinions.  I like that you are willing to state them in this forum.  I don't have a whole lot to add personally on the topic... maybe convincing you to keep posting reasonable arguments is an indirect contribution?",
