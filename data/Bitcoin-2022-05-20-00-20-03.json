The discussion is about demand for dollars via taxes giving dollars value. My point is that paying with Bitcoin doesn\u2019t mean anything if it gets converted to dollars at point of payment.\n\nThis is broadly true in the market in general too. Paying with Bitcoin at a store gives it utility but unless that store keeps it in Bitcoin it becomes downward price pressure on Bitcoin spot markets. Therefore it increases demand for dollars relative to Bitcoin.\n\nA circular Bitcoin economy is important because it means goods and services can be obtained without creating demand for dollars. This doesn\u2019t make Bitcoin worthless, just pointing out the facts.",

                    "response": "# #1\n\nINFLATION doesn't just mean an increase in the money supply. It can create a self-reinforcing loop. For example, as the money supply relentlessly increases, so must the institutions and banks to corral it all. This means more powerful institutions, which means bigger governing bodies, and this means more powerful lawmakers, and more powerful lawmakers means a more powerful government. Put enough of these in the world together and you'll have endless problems and useless power dynamics.\n\n# #2\n\nA deflationary system seeks to do the opposite of an inflationary system OUTSIDE the money, like the internet did. For example, we shoehorned entire libraries, universities, media, and the world's known history into hard drives and servers the size of shoeboxes or smaller. This created an overabundance of information, with incredible amounts of new knowledge-research-discoveries being added daily. A deflationary money will create an abundance of products and services OUTSIDE the money. You won't have fancy new high-rises overlooking Central Park with 100% ownership and 5% occupancy. Inefficient. They won't need to find goods to stuff all the money into, and there's no capitalist incentive to restrict those goods.\n\n# #3\n\nBitcoin is backed by energy. Energy cannot be counterfeited. That means it's unbreakable along its protocol consensus rules. It uses the one-directional entropy of energy to secure the immutable transparent ledger, and to control issuance. This makes bitcoin trustless, neutral money that can enforce rules.\n\n# #4\n\nBitcoin subsidizes flexible load energy  (sun, wind) by using all the waste overproduced on a grid. This lines the pockets of green energy companies in a way that heretofore only governments have been able to with manipulation of the tax code (such as credits, import duties, and write-offs). This means they have free market money for their R&D and production. It also reduces the contract pricing for businesses and individuals using the grid's energy. Also, miners capture wasted gas flare energy reducing methane. Today, bitcoin mining is 56% renewable, and the majority of the baseload energy used is excess that would've gotten burned or wasted. 15%-30% of all grid energy (depending on the grid efficiency) is wasted. This means bitcoin mining can tactically scale 20x and use ZERO energy.  At this pace bitcoin will be 99% renewable by 2028.\n\n# #5\n\nBitcoin separates money from State. When that happens, government waste is eliminated. And without the ability to print money, there is no ability to make war. That means military industrial complexes crack leaking tremendous amounts of time, money, and resources back into society in a wealth distribution scheme at odds with robbing Jeff Bezos to give his money to people that will give it right back to him. With this borders disintegrate. The prestige of governments is whittled down to utility and its ideas of value, at odds with legislation of mere symbolism.\n\n# #6\n\nBitcoin is decentralized because it's open source, immutable, secures set rules, is permissionless and p2p. Any government, company, or individual can mine, run a node, submit a BIP (bitcoin improvement proposal), create a wallet, send, spend, etcetera. If someone owns 1000 BTC, they are no different than someone with 1BTC. Why? Because they can't vote, they can't stake their coins to secure the network, they can't collude, or do anything anyone else can't. Exchanges dislike this as do governments because there's no special treatment, they can't control it. That's why Exchanges rely on a robust shitcoin market for their profit margins. Without shitcoins, they don't have a business. Because of bitcoin's open source nature and decentralization, the technology surrounding it will always trend towards its cost of production as information--which is close to zero. That's how we end up with things like the Lightning Network and non-custodial free wallets with UX's as good as anything centralized.\n\n# #7\n\nBitcoin is a transparent honest base layer. In our world, our financial base layer is fiat/debt. This is a dishonest base layer. When you have a dishonest base layer, nothing built over it can ever be honest. Everything that works gets built in layers, wether that's a human body, atom, planet, or pizza.\n\n**This is why bitcoin is important.**",

The rate of issuing new coins was set at the beginning by Satoshi and cannot be changed. It's still inflating at around 1% a year right now with the current mining rewards, but it is designed to reduce over time at a predefined rate.\n\nYou could argue that a fixed, indefinite, predefined rate of inflation would be better. But at what rate? 2%? 4%? 10%? You cant change it dynamically in response to events because that requires a decision-maker. Bitcoin's Raison d'\u00eatre is to avoid central control.\n\n>what is the end goal of Bitcoin?\n\nIt has no goal other than what people choose to use it for.
