The fed will start to unload their assets & the markets won't like that so good chance prices will probably go down further... plus there's like another 5 fed meetings this year, some of which will surely include more interest rate hikes, so lot's more downside could be to come.... with that said, we're still pretty low right now, so with a long term horizon it can't be a bad idea to start nibbling your way in at these prices. Maybe just don't unload a long all at once, average it in throughout the rest of the year.",
