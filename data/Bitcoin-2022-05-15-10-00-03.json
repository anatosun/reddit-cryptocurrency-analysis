Past performance shows, that Lump Sum wins in 70.62% of cases, and when it wins, it performs 13.54 times better.\n\nWhat this chart under-represents is how often \"lump sum\" loses for an individual. People dont start buying evenly at all times. Most people who FOMO in tend to buy in the short bull season, and very few people buy in the long bear season. The reason you can tell that is inherently true is that if lots of people were buying it wouldnt be a bear cycle in the first place, and if noone was buying it wouldnt be a bull season.\n\nSo Lump Sum wins by **Calendar Time** but loses badly by **Mental Time**\n\nIOW: for you as an individual, you are much more likely to feel FOMO (a time when DCA wins) and you are less likely to feel a strong desire to get in when btc is down (a time when Lump wins). \n\nIf  you suddenly come into a bunch of dirty fiat, and you want to dump it efficiently:\n\n* If you feel a strong urge to buy in, and bitcoin has been going up, and all sentiment is full-bull, giddy positive memes are flowing, it is probably close to the top. So temper your enthusiasm and DCA over time, because you are likely in a bull time cycle (about 30% of the time) and sentiment will probably drop soon.\n* If market sentiment is shot, everyone is in the doldrums, mass media is saying \"bitcoin is dead\", and there was a big USD price drop recently, then you are probably in a bear cycle (about 70% of the time). It can end at any moment, with a green candle so tall you will never get a second chance at it. So go all in to satoshis ASAP.\n* If you dont know which state things are in, then its probably better to DCA. The reason is that odds are good you are being subconsciously biased, and in investing, herd instincts almost always lead you off a cliff. And we know thats true, because thats why we have silly bull and bear cycles anyway. If everone was rational, they would all be racing to lump sum into BTC asap, and the dollar would drop to zero in a week.",

While I personally do not have problem with DCA by itself, I see that new investors and especially \"cryptobros\" overestimate what DCA can do (We can just read the title of this thread .. \"smartest\", \"most effective\" ... it is neither by a long shot), and at the same time they heavily underestimate actual cost of exercising this strategy (they think they lose out a few % while in reality they divide the yield by 3-12, depeding on the period).

Advice is generally geared for the fomo crowd. If we were only talking to steel minded hardened investors with ice in their veins, they wouldnt need advice anyway. They would have already heard of the general superiority of lump sum investing, for decades likely.\n\nDCA is a great strategy for someone who came into cash, is emotional about it, reacts to perceived loss with panic sells, and has no idea what bear/bull markets are. A model that shows the \"lump sum\" investor dumping everything each time he is down 10% or more then rebuying the next time at 50% higher would be a better model for a typical retail investor. \n\nI know at least a handful of people irl who lumped in on the tail end of a bull run and sold somewhere from half to all the way to the bottom. What DCA would have brought to them is a reduction in their emotional roller coaster. DCA moderates them. As a strategy it has a significant cost, but it buys not only reduced risk, but training on how to hold wealth and not make the kinds of moves that destroy it.",
