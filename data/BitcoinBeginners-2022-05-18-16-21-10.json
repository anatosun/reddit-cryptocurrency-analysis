            "selftext": "So I am pretty new to Bitcoin and I am looking to see about starting to mine one a small scale. I am not in it to get rich quick I am just hoping to buy an ASIC miner that will return some level of a profit in the long-term so I can accumulate more Bitcoin. I recently came into a small amount of fiat capital as a result of a workers compensation settlement and have been looking into ASIC mining machines. I was just hoping for some suggestions here as to what kind of ASIC miner you would recommend to start off for this purpose. I have heard that Antminer may be a quality product for this purpose but there are many variations and price ranges that I have seen online. I am not looking to break the bank and trying to see if there are any viable options that may be in the 1k-2k price range (depending on what I can get my wife on board with). Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

It's why I don't own one, my electricity costs ~.14/kwh and would have to have the newest miner to see any profits and ROI would be 10+ years. The miner won't last that long. \n\nSmall time mining is difficult because it's easy to get corporate level funding that allows someone to get the best electricity prices in the country or world by building a custom mining warehouse, possibly negotiating an even better rate or a tax discount from the local government when you can show almost guaranteed returns.",

If you pay >10ct/kwh you need the latest S19 to break even which is \\~$10k.  \nAnother aspect of home mining is: use that heat. IF you heat your home with electrycity anyway - do it with miners! same power costs but you get free bitcoin :D Only down side is you need to think of a smart setup to harvest the heat for your home while keeping the noise away.",

It can mine a few sats, that's for sure, but it won't make you a millionaire.\n\nIt's a great starting point for you to decide if you want to deal with noisy and hot machines. This one can be tuned down to mine in almost complete silence (with lower hashrate of course), or at turbo with a lot of noise, but double or triple the hashrate.",
