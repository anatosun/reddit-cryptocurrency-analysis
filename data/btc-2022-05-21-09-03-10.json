It's just game theory that Bitcoin miners would defend BCH as they all know that Bitcoin will eventually run out of money for security while BCH has a change to hit hunderds of millions of tx a day which can pay for security. \n\n> I was comparing to actual cash - the use case you are after here.\n\nBy far the main issue is the price instability.\n\nYou are a 100% correct that volatility in a currency makes it so that it can NOT be currency. \n\nSo what we are trying to accomplish is closed economic loops and also localized unit of account.\n\nLiquidity pool tokens with a percentage bch and a stablecoin will also help with this.\n\nStill right now it's very much a chicken and egg problem. \n\nMerchants will only want to accept it when there is demand from their customers while customers will only start using it when their merchants accept it.\n\nNobody has solved this problem yet. And 99 999 out of a 100 000 people in crypto have gotten distracted by the get rich quick scheme. Which ain't going to work. Less than 1 out of a 100 000 people is going to get rich from crypto and that money will come from the 99 999 losers.",
