If you arent a trader, dont randomly buy and sell. Just buy what you can afford to lose, hold it, use it gradually, and dont forget to also hold fiat and other assets (real estate, food and life necessities, etc..).",

If the risk-asset investors are treating bitcoin as a risk asset, and they are the ones that trade more often, then they are the ones that set the price- the price is always set by the last trade, whatever it is. When they leave the market, and notice I say WHEN, then that price setting shifts to the hands of those that are accumulating for the longer term. And this shift, like all shifts will be temporary, until it is seen again as a risk assert and a new type of investor comes back in. But the difference this time, Kate, is that there is less available for those investors when they come back in. So when we see the move up, it will be sharp!",

They then hope that Congress passes enough regulations (at least around stablecoins) that they can gatekeep the space and become a huge player. Then they can get massive amounts of funds from anyone who needs a stablecoin to trade on an exchange and they can be just as risky with their fractional investments as the original stable coins were because the government can and will just bail them out when things go tits up.",

How is this different from any of the above?\n\n\n>Once BTC reached $30k start dumping UST to make it lose it's peg.\n\n\nHmmm... so basically BUYING BTC? Or what do you \"dump UST\" for? Some other shitcoin? Didn't see anything pumping hard, which it would if that much money would be put into it.\n\nAlso, arbitrageours would quickly profit from all this, without even trying since the peg is maintained by bots across many exchanges.\n\n> Kwon forced to sell\n\nWhy??? Does he have a leveraged long and we know the open price?\n\n\n> Meanwhile citadel is shorting all the way\n\nHang on, thought they were dumping UST? How are they still short???\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOK, fully convinced myself this is bullshit of the finest variety. This is just a random anon trying to explain shit he doesn't understand at all.",

Either way, by the time you finish your assigned reading, the price will likely be higher than it is today.\n\nEdit: also compare any loss you would have taken to a traditional index like the S&P 500.

Companies, governments, they promise to take care of you online, but whenever you blink, they may suddenly start using it against you.\n\n\nPart of not letting the government impose into your personal life is knowing what the government wants from you and having that information ready and prepared. This is actually a good thing as it keeps you informed about what the government's function is and it keeps you organised and better at dealing with money.\n\nSo you get kyc free bitcoin, but you keep track of all your sources of income, all the capital gains and you make sure you don't have anything unaccounted for because that's when they'll shout fraud or money laundering or criminal activity.",

It's uncomfortable and unnerving and we are all looking for some hopium to help us through.\n\nI used to wonder why BTC price can shoot up in such a rapid fashion. How once it reaches a certain price it just blasts through it and onto the next..\n\nI believe this comes from the conviction of the current owners of the coins. Institutions, miners and retail. They believe in its value, so they don't sell and hold out for a bigger number or just don't sell at all.\n\nThese people are the ones not selling right now, in this proper fear inducing dip.\n\nAll the others who would sell it on the way up are selling out or will get out in this downturn. This is what strengthens the asset over time. The \"shake out\".\n\nIt really is true if you cant handle the losses you don't deserve the gains.\n\nFingers crossed the shake out ends sooners rather than later. Keep healthy and enjoy life, maybe stop watching the charts haha.",

Less central planning, more free market action.\n\n* The Fed is tightening now. However, I'm absolutely sure they will have to reverse course once effects of the tightening will start to hit the real economy, companies go bankrupt, the yield on government bonds grow too large etc. History has shown that the central banks will always issue more money to solve problems.

Regulations are good for consumers.\n\nWhen you go down the libertarian path of \u201cfree market naked capitalism for everyone\u201d you end up having the sharks preying on the short stacks, so to speak.\n\nAnd I get that plenty of people in this sun see themselves as potential sharks and so they are excited about those gains, but acting like it\u2019s better for the consumer to have fewer regulations and protections is just not accurate.\n\nA separate conversation can be had about the current state of financial regulation in the west, specially the United States, and the pseudo-oligarchy that we have in this country. Which is a problem. But that doesn\u2019t mean the solution is to remove all regulations. That would be like saying your vehicle has a safety issue and needs to be recalled, so you want to instead drive down the highway on a lawnmower with rockets strapped to it that you made yourself with zero protections instead.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of conflation between problems that exist with our current financial/governmental systems and \u201csolutions\u201d that don\u2019t actually address those problems.",

Many people believe that Bitcoin traders and investors will panic and sell their BTC stacks in the next few days. What do you think about it?  \n\n\nDo you believe Bitcoin will reach the low $30,000 range? In such a situation, I believe it may be a good time to buy. However, that purchasing opportunity as some analytics says is more likely to return to $37,000 before making another new bottom later this summer.  \n\n\nWould you say this is not a very good-looking chart? I would, there are a lot of swings in price lately.  \n\n\nOne thing that worries me a little bit is that trader Tone Vays's prediction says that BTC will likely bottom out in November this year at around $25,000. Do you think that we should consider that option and rely on that information?  \n\n\nIs this the right time for investing in Duet Protocol's three assets BTC, gold, and oil maybe? I've heard that everyone is talking about that as the safest investment. What do you think?  \n\n\nHow are you dealing with this information, do you have a long-term plan?",

I hope the price stays low enough to scare off some paper hands and replace what I sold earlier this year to buy my house.",

At this rate a single organisation could easily control a majority of staked ETH by year's end.\n\nTo see how fast this monster is growing, check out the following chart (select total marketcap and set denominator to ETH):\n\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-staked-ether",
