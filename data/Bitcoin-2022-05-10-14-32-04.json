I bought at $50 in 2011 on a long gone exchange, and immediately Bitcoin fell to $12. I felt stupid. So in defiance, I promised myself I wouldn't sell until it reached an impossibly high number.  1000x. But $50k came and I couldn't bear to sell. I love this journey too much. And I see now that my crazy goal was way too low. My vision for Bitcoin was too small. \nNow I need a 10000x return. When that day comes, I want this post here so I can rub it in the faces of the zero-coiners who were here in 2022 and who, even when offered Bitcoin at a huge discount, refused to buy in. You'll never buy. You don't have the vision or stamina to not only acquire Bitcoin, but to keep your Bitcoin.\nGo the fuck away. You make /r/bitcoin suck.\nBut please come back the day Bitcoin kisses $500k. I'll have a message for you on that day.",

Many people believe that Bitcoin traders and investors will panic and sell their BTC stacks in the next few days. What do you think about it?  \n\n\nDo you believe Bitcoin will reach the low $30,000 range? In such a situation, I believe it may be a good time to buy. However, that purchasing opportunity as some analytics says is more likely to return to $37,000 before making another new bottom later this summer.  \n\n\nWould you say this is not a very good-looking chart? I would, there are a lot of swings in price lately.  \n\n\nOne thing that worries me a little bit is that trader Tone Vays's prediction says that BTC will likely bottom out in November this year at around $25,000. Do you think that we should consider that option and rely on that information?  \n\n\nIs this the right time for investing in Duet Protocol's three assets BTC, gold, and oil maybe? I've heard that everyone is talking about that as the safest investment. What do you think?  \n\n\nHow are you dealing with this information, do you have a long-term plan?",

If the risk-asset investors are treating bitcoin as a risk asset, and they are the ones that trade more often, then they are the ones that set the price- the price is always set by the last trade, whatever it is. When they leave the market, and notice I say WHEN, then that price setting shifts to the hands of those that are accumulating for the longer term. And this shift, like all shifts will be temporary, until it is seen again as a risk assert and a new type of investor comes back in. But the difference this time, Kate, is that there is less available for those investors when they come back in. So when we see the move up, it will be sharp!",
