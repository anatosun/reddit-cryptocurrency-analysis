Why invest in Google, someone can make another google and became more popular! Why hold dollars, someone else can create other dollars!",

Seashells are better than cows. Gold is better than seashells. Bitcoin is better than gold. At some point something will be better than Bitcoin.\n\nI don't know what it will be. If I could imagine it, I would invent it. I can say for sure that none of the myriad crypto coins are better than Bitcoin, so probably whatever is better than Bitcoin hasn't been invented, yet. And I'm not holding my breath.\n\nIt isn't possible to be harder money than Bitcoin, which is already perfectly scarce. So whatever is better than Bitcoin will have to innovate in other areas. Also, it's not really enough to be a little better than Bitcoin. Whatever replaces Bitcoin has to be a lot better. It's a tall order, so I suspect Bitcoin will be the best money for a long while.",
