The bear market is where all the gaps tend to get filled... After all, 90% of all gaps get filled.  There's a gap around 20k and one around 14.5k.  There my friends is your buy range.  I'm going to start my DCA on that entire range just in case we bounce off of the 20k range.  Historically going below the previous top would be a first for a Bitcoin cycle but I believe we will close at least one gap.",
