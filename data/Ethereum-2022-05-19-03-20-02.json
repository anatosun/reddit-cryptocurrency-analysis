It\u2019s far away from the near 5k levels it was at 6 months ago and I\u2019m seeing some people a bit concerned and other quite frankly panicking.\n\nAnd while its normal for people to be frustrated at times like these (after all no one likes to lose money), I think that Ethereum investors and fanatics in particular shouldn\u2019t be that concerned.\n\nAside from the price action being relatively much better than other alts, Ethereum is probably the most reliable out of all chains and will always get the job done at the end of the day.\n\nThis is why I\u2019m not too surprised seeing so many whales buying up ETH like its candy. Look at Etherscan and see the top 50 accounts and how much they\u2019re stacking up. BitDAO alone has been adding more than 360 ETH on a DAILY basis and has already accumulated more than $500 million worth of ETH in its treasury.\n\nSeeing all these whales and legitimate projects are stacking up ETH at this ever increasing rate gives me solace and bolsters by belief in Ethereum more and more. This is only a phase and we should be back on track as soon as the market goes green again.",

Apart from them, no one lost money. So, being frustrated isn't normal. To lose money, you'd need to sell low. If anyone sold low, it's their own decision. Being frustrated for this means there should be some internal discussion within that person about whether or not they were agreeing with the fact of selling low, because clearly no one forced such person to sell low.\n\nPeople should stop reacting to pump & dump schemes and similar temporary volatility. Otherwise, they're bound to lose. It's hard to time the market. Really hard. And if you understand the tech, you'd easily realize it's not even needed to profit from it, really.",
