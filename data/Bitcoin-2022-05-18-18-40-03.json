Bitcoin can be temporally brought down in price which hurts its credibility just like in 2017...On Dec 21st 2017 the first futures contract representing 5 bitcoin started trading. Prior top this date btc was pumped to over $19,500. The (big, smarter, coordinated) money bought up btc in a big way to add to the pump and then started dumping it, at the same time the Futures markets were opening up. They were able to short the market with leverage in a regulated way for the first time. Go look at the charts around Dec 2017. You will see the the dates coincide....Attack on price Yes. Attack on network, No.",
