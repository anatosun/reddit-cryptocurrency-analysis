One who seizes the chance to change the world and the entire global economy -- and become financially secure -- and friendlier and kinder and \"gooder\" while doing it.\n\nWe are all taking a chance! All of us! And it's a chance that not everyone is willing or capable of taking. I totally understand that.\n\nAfter all, did everyone leave their homes to take the risk of becoming an early colonist of the Americas? No, but many who did got to be a part of redefining what a nation can be -- they got to start something exciting that had never been tried before... A truly free society. And many of them died, gave up too early, or didn't make it in the process.\n\nI can't say that the United States in its current form has lived up to the dreams and ideals of its original founders. And people can debate all they like about the purity and intention that the original colonies were founded upon.\n\nBut ultimately, looking back at past mistakes or failures, is not a reason to avoid taking risks and trying to do something entirely fresh and new. \n\nNow in these increasingly digital times -- we're pushing against the very real economic frontiers, into new waters that have never been tried before. \n\nBTC, DOGE, ETH (and unfortunately even Luna) all of these communities are doing something unique in this space. And, yes, sometimes they die -- but sometimes they also flourish beyond anyone's wildest dreams. \n\nLike the original American colonists, all of us are defining the new financial reality ahead of us. We're experimenting with community. We're experimenting with value and how OUR VALUES are expressed in it. \n\nAnd I would argue that the DOGE community is doing something extra special and unique when it comes to bringing together both financial value and Our Values as a digital society in ways that were never done before. \n\nBTC, ETH and other projects are doing it too, in their own way, trying to address what the new digital economy needs and demands.\n\nUltimately, each crypto community recognizes that the old financial systems are obsolete and they are crumbling. We need new and faster systems -- decentralized systems -- that satisfy the multifaceted needs of the global digital financial community.\n\nSo yeah, there is BTC and ETH and LTC and Monero, etc., etc.... And there is also DOGE.\n\nHow many of these cryptos stand on the foundation of Love, Generosity, Light Hearted Jokes, Memes, and rocksolid community? \n\nHow many cryptocurrencies have an image of the sweetest most loveable dog in the universe as the symbol they rally behind?\n\nDoge. Only Doge. \n\nIt's an experiment! It's a big, global, wonderful, incredible experiment full of love, dreams, hopes, heart, friendship, community, and goodness. And, yeah, I know that there is also greed -- as there always will be when value is involved. \n\nBut value -- at its core -- is about OUR VALUES as a people and as a global society and as a community.\n\nSo what do you value? I value DOGE! \n\nDo Only Good Everyday.",
