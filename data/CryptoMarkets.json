But I'm convinced that altcoins are on their way to break the correlation with BTC. I mean loads of alts have huge potential and the can be performing much better if it wasn't for BTC. \n\nMATIC for example is one of these, its ecosystem is growing enormously, and it's getting a lot of upgrades constantly, I believe this a perfect example of alts that are held imprisoned by Bitcoin's performance. But alts are definitely going to decouple off of BTC, and that may be sooner than what we expect.",

I just don't hold cash like a corporation does for long periods so I am not making the connection yet with BTC outside of a speculative asset (which is how I \"use\" it currently).",

That's because the value of Bitcoin still goes up around 3 to 5 times between bull runs. This is great for the traders and hodlers alike. Once this cycle stops (because the rewards will be so small that mining has no more impact on the total price of Bitcoin), the volatility will go down and Bitcoin will become an incredibly stable asset. In fact, personally I believe that Bitcoin will become the most stable asset to ever exist, only slowly going up in value as the value of everything humans create increases.",

Because I've had the same idea in the past and it's honestly not viable even in the Sahara you'd need around \u00a315k setup to make \u00a310 per day in bitcoin.\n\nIf your serious. I'd say spend the \u00a315k on bitcoin. Sit tight and prey bitcoin goes up.\n\nIf your living somewhere which has nightfall. You'd need a huge battery bank and bigger solar array 30x pannels and plus another 3 inverters to charge the batteries to run the miner at night.\n\nYou'd end up spending any profits on replacing faulty inverters and batteries due to wear and tear.\n\nMaybe a proof of stake would be best option if you love those kind of payments.\n\nShame cos it'd be such a fun project and hobby.",

This helps maintain a healthy and stable token price that benefits traders, investors, and liquidity providers.\r  \n\r  \nGemkeeper is a community-focused Automated Market Maker (AMM) and DeFi platform built on Oasis\u2019 Emerald Paratime. It allows users to execute token swaps, enter existing and create new liquidity pools. Gemkeeper exposes users to yield farming on Oasis using globally accepted crypto assets; users earn $BLING by staking their GemKeeper Liquidity Pool (GLP) tokens in the Gem Mine.\r  \n\r  \nFountain Protocol \u2014 a first cross-chain lending platform powered by Oasis \u2014 enables users to experience high capital efficiency management of DeFi assets. The Fountain Lending Pool allows users to receive a high yield return with low gas fees through a smooth lending protocol where lending and borrowing are accessible to all. \r  \n\r  \nIn addition, we have integrated with several bridges!

They also range from companies that work in all possible areas from medical, automotive, DeFi, NFT, trading, staking, etc. This is to say that for an ecosystem like Oasis there are a lot of partners that focus on different aspects. And that is because a network like Oasis has so broad use cases and interests. \n\nIt would be useful to look at our roadmap to find our current interests, but let me just quickly mention a couple of things that we are currently working on. NFT and GameFi economies are very interesting to us, and we are working on integrating the building blocks and primitives that allow us to bootstrap those into our network. One company from our Metaminds x Accelerator program (another partner :D ), Rosart, already released their NFT Launchpad, and are launching their marketplace. Rosart is also becoming a partner to our other programs so that they can support other projects in our ecosystem, like the foundation has supported them. This way we facilitate success in all ways and cross generationally. \n\nAnother focuses of ours are DeFi and Confidentiality. Those are whole different stories, but with very similar dynamics as with Rosart. Ultimately, building success for a L1 revolves around partnerships as long term win-win situations are what it takes to be successful in this space.",

We\u2019re ramping up 2022 to be the year of growth and I\u2019ve developed and aggressive strategy that is fully deployed and in action. We have so many amazing events planned for our community and one of the best ways for them to get involved is our Ambassador Program!\r  \n \r  \n\ud83d\udce3Oasis Ambassador Program \ud83d\udce3\r  \n(https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/become-an-oasis-ambassador-and-build-a-responsible-data-economy-bbd38d0f9c12) which has a special incentive breakdown only available to ambassadors. The program has grown to over 500+ members including our China team, making local outreach easier than ever.

We are highly underrated when it comes to our global presence and we are looking to change this in the upcoming quarters in a dramatic way.\r  \n\r  \nOur approach is that we attract high-quality Ambassadors from online communities just like this one. We grow and empower our Ambassadors to use the skills they have from their existing careers and interests. There are community content generation bounties, community engagement bounties, marketing bounties, BD bounties, and soon to launch our Ecosystem Ambassador Bounty Program. \ud83d\ude0e\r  \n\r  \nThe Ambassador program is a perfect onramp into the industry and we\u2019ve proudly helped many of our Ambassadors secure jobs within the industry!\r  \n\r  \nIf you are interested in our ambassador program, you can learn more about it here and earn $ROSE: https://oasisprotocol.org/ambassador-program\r  \n\r  \nWe are also currently focusing heavily on building the Defi 2.0 ecosystem and applications, and the NFT + P2E gaming ecosystem. As we speak there are a lot of teams deploying their applications to the Network via the acceleration and hackathon programs. Aside of the ones being developed its already possible to use some of the many DEXes and lending protocols, and to collect some amazing NFT sets \ud83e\udd73\r  \nOur current hackathon, The Oasis Bloom Hackathon, will raise brand awareness of Oasis within the developer community and yield some great dApps for our ecosystem. This hackathon facilitates the next generation of DApps for web3 & beyond in areas such as DeFi and P2E Gaming. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the support of our sponsors, Jump, NGC, Newman, Hashed and Dragonfly. The winning teams will also have access to potential investments and mentorship opportunities provided by the sponsors, especially for the winning teams.

Thanks for asking it :)  \n\n\nThe mainstream has a lot of use cases that can benefit from transposing existing web2 and offline process to a smart contract / decentralized system. Most of these currently, however, suffer from the public nature of all data stored on chain. If you just imagine, how many things would you store online if all of the information was publicly available. Things like all of your emails, your bank account transactions and location data can be stored on the blockchain but currently only in a public format where everyone has access to the same data.  \n\n\nNow this is obviously a sub optimal method of doing things, and this is what Oasis is here to solve. Our technology allows us to store all this information using blockchain but to keep it private simultaneously. That is what we believe will be the catalyst for mainstream adaptation. Timing wise we are actually really close now for that to happen, so I\u2019m expecting first mainstream applications using confidential data to roll out in 2022. And that\u2019s super exciting!",

It\u2019s also not technically following the rules, but after a long time of manual grinding I also discovered the ability to run multiple bots simultaneously which increased the efficiency of gameplay and most importantly, the amount of items that I was able to gather. \n\nThe thing is that back in that time there was no proper way to monetize the in-game assets you had. Only through shady websites was that possible, and sometimes people would also sell cracked items that got deleted after game patches as they were in reality not legit. NFTs address this crucial aspect: ability to buy and sell items, and to know that they are legitimate. In addition, blockchain games have a lot of possibilities for building reputation systems using on-chain activity to detect fraudulent behavior, something I should have been definitely banned for in my time :D\n\nThere is a strong trend currently towards P2E idle games that essentially function as NFT and token minting machines where they generate tokens and allow to breed assets to a certain point where the early players have gotten a strong enough position that it becomes inaccessible to the new players. In trading terms, I would be short on these type of projects.\n\nHowever, we are seeing a really cool wave of Triple A games announcing their GameFi and P2E economies which in trading terms I would be very bullish on. In the short term there definitely will be a lot of browser based P2E games getting a lot of hype, but in the long run the Triple A desktop / console games will most likely bring the GameFi space into the next level.",

Unlike a Parachain, a ParaTime does not need to do consensus itself, making it simpler to develop and more integrate into the network as a whole. ParaTimes take care of compute and discrepancy detection is used to ensure correctness and integrity of execution, making ParaTimes more efficient than Parachains and other chain designs that rely on sharding.  ParaTimes supports confidential compute, allowing it to support new and innovative use cases that require handling sensitive data and fixing many of the existing issues with DeFi such as front running. \r  \n \r  \nBecause ParaTimes separates consensus from compute, and puts little restrictions on the kind of compute environments that can be built, the Network has the ability to simultaneously support enterprise use cases, fully open compute networks, specialized runtimes for machine learning, AI, etc. This separation allows multiple ParaTimes to process transactions in parallel, meaning complex workloads processed on one ParaTime won\u2019t slow down faster, simpler transactions on another. This is a major source of bottlenecks and gas-fee expenses for most blockchains, inhibiting their wide-scale adoption. Separating PTs computation from each other and operating them with their own 'ParaTime engines' (virtual machines essentially) also enables Oasis to provide a holistic environment for PT occupiers.\r  \n \r  \nOur governance model ensures there is no competition within the ecosystem for support. An Inter-ParaTime communication protocol is on the roadmap for 2022 and it will be a total game changer as it will allow for dapps on different ParaTimes to share value and features with each other. We have Parcel, Emerald (our EVM compatible ParaTime) and  CIPHER (our WASM ParaTime) which will be adding privacy to the blockchain industry in a way never before enabled. Oasis is a great network for building scalable web3 applications that allow users to retain ownership of their own data, and to monetize it.Tokenized data is currently used in the Parcel environment by entities looking to benefit from the ease of integration through the Parcel API. \r  \n \r  \nOasis can protect your data/keep it private in applications, so that you retain ownership of your information and choose who can see it. On an application that takes advantage of this Oasis feature, if you don't want to share your data with others it's totally possible. Currently a lot of web2 services sell your information to third parties and make money off it without the end user knowing where their data is going, Oasis is making strides to create an internet where the end user can also benefit from this monetization, a responsible data economy.",

We didn't just choose an acronym for Oasis, we chose a statement with historical meaning that we felt embodied the way our team deeply considers every single decision we make. \n\nA large part of the inspiration behind our name comes from what an Oasis represents. We are the Oasis of privacy in the privacy desert that's the current web. You could also take some James Halliday references to Ready Player One with the metaverse they build and live in being called the \u201cOasis\u201d, but that\u2019s more of a coincidence and might come up later on during some puzzle campaigns I\u2019m working on.  \ud83d\ude09\r  \n\r  \nWhat's even more exciting, is the $ROSE name selection which was actually thought out in incredible detail. \ud83d\ude0e\r  \n\r  \n**\ud83c\udf39ROSE: A Symbol of Privacy \ud83d\udc40**\r  \nWe wanted the token to stand as a representation for the network and Roses fit very well with this imagery. Historically they have often represented \u201csecrecy\u201d. Dating back to Ancient Greece, the Rose was seen as a symbol for secrets or privacy, used by Aphrodite as a gift in exchange for keeping the secrets of Gods.\r  \n\r  \nIn Ancient Rome this symbolism continued and the phrase \u201csub rosa\u201d or \u201cunder the rose\u201d was to mean \u201cdone in secret\u201d or \u201cunder a pledge of secrecy\u201d. This phrase and the symbol of Roses as secrecy extended throughout history with the British Tudors era where state secrets were decided in a room with a large rose hanging from the ceiling.\r  \n\r  \nThis fits well with our vision for the Oasis Network, which seeks to power the next generation of blockchain use cases through its unique capacity to support confidential computing and private data on the ledger.\r  \n\r  \nYou can read more about it in here: [https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/introducing-rose-the-oasis-network-token-cee031b5a532](https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/introducing-rose-the-oasis-network-token-cee031b5a532)",

The trick usually to distinguish real usage from hype is to look at the onchain transaction activity versus the price activity. Currently as the crypto market is small, it is still possible to have a disproportionate influence with hype marketing. In the long term, however, the measure of the success of the network will become the onchain activity it has. \n\nMuch like with \u2018normal\u2019 companies the valuation model is set based on their commercial activity. There will always be some premiums aside of tangible / non tangible assets and revenue, the thing in crypto currently is that the real usage is still small, which leaves a lot of room for that type of value, which hype is included in.\n\nOur approach to this is to focus on building. There\u2019s a lot of noise in the space, and we do not want to be distracted with all of that. Our goal is to support the teams that are building in the network, and to ensure the developer experience is as good as possible. Aside from developer experience we are putting in a lot of effort to ensure that the community is well informed and supported.",

We all could use a little help in life and putting your ego aside and giving yourself permission to learn from someone you respect and admire is a quality worth possessing. \r  \n \r  \nI had the privilege of being mentored by the GM & President of the Metal Industries company I worked at throughout my 20\u2019s. He taught me the values of business, groomed me to understand contract negotiations tactics and pushed me to apply for leadership positions within the industry. He encouraged me to develop my skills in every way possible and taught me the cut-throat mentality required when it comes to business. I appreciate this man very much in my life and wouldn\u2019t be who I am today without his mentorship.\r  \n \r  \nSince I joined the Oasis team, Professor Dr. Dawn Song has been an inspiration to me and has been helping me take my career to the next level in this amazing industry of Blockchain. She encourages me to push my expectations higher, to have a more clear vision and to set our sights on goals that to many individuals, would see as impossible. We at the Oasis Network don\u2019t believe in the impossible, we are enabling what once was believed to be impossible, therefore we believe anything is possible.",

Denying that is plain ignorance on how markets work. If you think that ETH consistently only gets its value from BTC then you are a fool. I would argue that much of the crypto matket's buoyance is supported by all the advances Ethereum has brought, including DeFi and NFTS. It's attracted a tonne more new money over the last 5 years. Proof of Stake is going to attract a whe lot of good press too due to the green factor and stakers will be getting ~15% APR.. which will no doubt get reduced as more stakers come online which ofc will further bolster the price. But people like yourself will no doubt say that it's to do with the halvening lol. This sub is hilariously ignorant. HFSP",

It's called technical debt, and it's a byproduct of any long-developed and growing project. Every software company deals with it. As long as it's dealt with in some manner, than it's a necessary byproduct of development. Nobody can project how their designs or code will hold up in 5 years, 1 year, even next month.\n\n> We are already past the point of anyone having a full picture of the system. This is bad.\n\nThis... is standard? Does the payment gateway team at Meta understand Facebook feed generation? And do they really need to? No.\n\nNow, this is precisely why as a software company grows, they commonly need to break apart their monolithic application. It's hard to scale dev teams when the software is so intertwined. Perhaps there's an architectural issue with ETH where even a small change in 1 team impacts all the code. That's an issue that should be resolved. But that doesn't necessarily mean feature dev needs to stop, or features need to be culled. All software companies go through this. The corporate slogan is \"fixing the plane while flying it.\"\n\nIMO, this is no cause for concern. Unless the tech debt in ETH brings down the network, or makes it unmanageable to develop in, than it's ok.",

But I would be more concerned with the blockchain's node requirements. Most blockchains the average person, even in The West, still can't run their own node and are beholden to only a few actors behind the curtain running backend servers to support their wallets and open attack vectors and loss of privacy etc. \n\nEthereum's transition should actually help against Sybil attacks but at the sacrifice of the average person being able to independently contribute to the ecosystem leaving it much more censorable and less private (increased node requirements, can't even stake without at least 32 ETH so need to give up custody to a third party).",

Recently I staked UDO and started earning 0.35% on UDO tokens on daily basis. It's a temporary program and it does not offer POS or anything but still why should I let go of it. For me, it doesn't matter if the project is offering PoW or PoS all I want to know is the project is legit or a rug. So I am happy with what have and will definitely keep your point in my mind, it might come in handy one day! Thanks for letting me share my take on this thread.\ud83d\ude09",

Do you understand that Uniswap, Axie Infinity, Loopring, AAVE, Shiba Inu, Compound, and 500+ other coins were all built on Ethereum?  Every time someone transacts with any of these coins Ethereum is paid.  Eth currently generates over $30 million a day in revenue and you don't think it will make it to mainstream?     \nHave you heard of CryptoPunks or  BoredApeYacht Clubs?  Both were built and run on the Eth network as well along with 90% of the most profitable NFTs on the market.  \n\nHedera has its good points but its owned and governed by companies such as Google, IBM, Boeing and LG which in my book makes it the least \"crypto\" crypto project on the market.  I personally see it as a research and development tool for major corporations to capitalize off of in this new and thriving industry.",

MATIC is also a great altcoin and one i owned for awhile. I let go of a large portion when it hit 2.80s and have since reallocated some of the profits into RBIF. It pays reflections, its super cheap, the dev team is great with the whitepaper and over delivering on promises made to the community. We\u2019re also preparing for 1% of RBIF to be burned once we hit 3000 holders. Which at the moment is sitting at about 31 left. I would check it out and see how you like it, there is a ROBOINU website to visit and to look at the details for yourself.",

I'm not an expert, but last week, redditors on Monero subs ask people to buy and withdraw Monero from exchanges. Why? Because they believe that some major exchanges sell Monero that they don't have, thus high demand, low supply - I guess.\n\nThat's all I know. Hope someone could bring a better explanation.",

It has to do with BTC being such a dominant asset in crypto currency, and how much of the liquidity in the crypto space being paired with BTC. Let\u2019s use an example BTC/BNB . If most of the liquidity for BNB is paired to BTC and BNB is worth  x amount of BTC then if BTC makes a move down this will also bring down the USD value of BNB. The x amount of BTC you can get for your BNB is now worth less in USD then before the BTC move down. Over time this will resolve as the market dominance of BTC falls but currently BTC is too big to fail and would collapse the entire crypto market.",

Good point as a matter of fact, The truth is that not everyone has the patience and literacy to understand the nitty-gritty details of a project's utility. This is why I often advise my friends to keep it simple sometimes. Get your stablecoins and put them in an automated yield generating protocol in DeFi. It's even better if it is a protocol that permits single deposits and auto-compounding such as spoolfi offers. \n\nNot everyone cares about profit. Not everyone is greedy. At the same time, not everyone gives a shit about utility. Some people just want a steady passive income that comes with low risks and disturbing volatility.",

That's essentially what a 'hardware' wallet is (which remember is software on a self-contained computer). Granted missing some significant features, but at it's core, very similar in practice esp in non-stupid hands. (With plenty of room for disagreement, I'm aware of the rebuttals)",

These however tend to have lower APRs 15-40%. For example pairing atom and Cro to generate osmo. Both coins have uses across multiple defi platforms so they are not dependant on performance of that particular Dex. The reward token is and will likely decrease in value over time like any yield coin but you are not over exposed to this risk (osmo could be an exception for a few reasons).\n\nPairing with a yield farm token will almost always result in a decrease of your principle due to inflation and sell pressure which is usually offset by a higher Apr. For example osmo-atom to produce Osmo. \n\nWith ultra high Apr farming (high risk 200+%) you only need about $15k to pump out $500-800 a week. However with high Apr comes high volatility and it doesn't matter how high the Apr is if the rewards or principal is losing 10% or more each week. These are positions that may only hold for a few months at the best. If the Apr is in the mid 100s you can almost guarantee this. \n\nFor more generic asset pairings with  30-70% range you need $60,000 to generate the same return but will be exposed to some volatility as you are likely pairing with a yield token.\n\nFor stable coin pairings at the 8-15% range you will need $200k. \n\nFind your risk tolerance, spread across multiple platforms, read the white papers! You need to know if there are pegs to watch or inflationary events etc and how everything works.",

Because they believe that some major exchanges sell Monero that they don't have, thus high demand, low supply - I guess.\n\nThat's all I know. Hope someone could bring a better explanation.",

There aren't many platforms that support Fantom and they recently hit $40M TVL so while there's still a lot of opportunity, it's not like you're aping into a sub $1M TVL degen farm.",

I think of Balancer as kind of going for the hostile takeover method, which obviously can be extremely powerful in the corporate world. I think the same thing will play out here.

There are a lot of us and growing every day that are of the same mindset and working in the same direction independently to free ourselves from the masters. I remember my old man saying they wanted us all living in housing projects way back in the mid 1980\u2019s and I thought he was crazy back then. They changed the name to \u201caffordable housing\u201d and it has come to pass. Perpetual renters because owning ur own home and a couple acres with a garden is almost unattainable. The only way to afford that is to enslave yourself to debt and a job that consumes almost every waking moment you have. And you get to spend 2 hours of awake time with the family and home you work for. This has been generations in the making, not one presidential term, not one lifetime congressional seat, this has been engineered over the last 50 years if not longer. You aren\u2019t alone and I hope to live long enough to see the people take their freedoms back and will do what I can to support projects and help this be successful and also do what I can to NOT participate in their system to the extent it can be done and take advantage of all routes to leave it entirely. Including downsizing and living with less to NOT pay the taxes to support it. 48 years old. Quit my job yesterday to cash out my 401k before it completely tanks, selling my house while the market is up and checking out. It\u2019s an orchestral 2 steps forward and 3 steps back my whole lifetime fighting against financial catastrophes and being a hamster on a wheel getting nowhere. I don\u2019t want the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d anymore, I want to be free. Those used to be the same thing. Now you can\u2019t have both.",

Recently came across a new project with a novel idea with regards to staking and passive income.  Archangel is the native token in an emerging ecosystem of tokens that all collaborate throughout different sectors within crypto.  By owning and subsequently staking your Archangel, you earn rewards from the entire ecosystem of tokens during each staking pool.  This is not APY or APR, but literal tokens in the form of reflections from the other projects.  For example, when staking pool 2 opens in a couple months, when you stake your Archangel, you will recieve Archangel, Scratch, Guardian, and Brainstem.  Each staking pool will earn more as the ecosystem grows.  It's an interesting concept, so if you are really into passive income you should check it out.",

What are your thoughts on Polkadex? I was fascinated with this project when their first crowdloan launched, and now after reading their whitepaper I\u2019m excited seeing them actually having a chance to win a parachain slot this time.\n3. What spaces do you see in Polkadot\u2019s ecosystem to contribute in and actually using it? (both as a developer or an amateur user)",

But from my limited knowledge on the space, I see Kusama as more than a test net, as far as I know it has everything that Polkadot have (except less security) but it's faster and cheaper! It's still a bit confusing the why of having both, and projects want to run on both chains.\n2. Can't tell much about Polkadex as I don't know it, but that's on the the queue as I mentioned about defi and dexes.\n3. I definitely want to be more active on the crowdloan scene, thats my current No.1 goal! Then I want to have a proper look on the ecosystem as a whole and then I can take an informed decision. I'm more acquainted with NFT and metaverse projects currently. LPs definitely interests me, and i definitely want to explore bridges with other ecosystems also",

If some of the boxes aren't ticked you can skip a project.\n\nI'll explain by taking the following example. NFT tickets allow to prevent scalping and protect ticket buyers from fraud as the secondary market can be controlled by smart contracts. However, the ticket is just the entry point.

It allows it to list any asset with a chainlink price feed. Currently is has over 50 crypto pairs, and 10 Forex, already making it the most diverse leverage exchange whether DEX or CEX. And it will be listing stocks by months' end and commodities after that.\n\nIt is a crypto with an actual product/service that people pay to use, generating a large revenue stream for the protocol.\n\nThe best part is, not only does it distribute almost all of the revenue it earns, it is also very deflationary. It's well known that short term leverage traders on average lose more than they earn, and the net losses buy back the $GNS tokens on the open market and burns them. In a little over a year it has burned 25% of the supply, while providing huge yields to LPs (often in excess of 100%, and always over 60%). \n\nThe GNS tokens form the liquidity backstop to the protocol, and are a necessary part of the ecosystem. Not just a shitty inflationary governance token with no use case. \n\nOnce the gTrade platform is fully built out with commodities and indices, (estimated Q4), the team will begin work on a decentralized casino and betting platform that will utilize and reward the same $GNS token. \n\nWith many countries banning CEXs from offering leverage trading, there is a vacuum that needs to be filled. Like it or not, leverage trading is a huge percentage of daily crypto volume, and these users are not going away just because their governments don't allow it on centralized exchanges. \n\nNot many projects can boast $2.72M distribution of revenue in the month of March (annualized at $32.94M) at a tiny $80M market cap, while burning 25% of supply in a year.",

Mainly because here in Australia you can no longer leverage on binance and because the kucoin futures liquidation threshold can be as bad as -30% in some cases.\n\nOne problem this doesn't suffer from that leverage on a CEX does is the the lack of any price slippage - which is precisely why CEX liquidation threshold can be as bad as above for a newly launched coin (pretty sure it was DOGE that they did me dirty on when they first launched it). You lose your liquidity so fast when people are able to take out $1m positions on just 10k if its not synthetic. \n\nThe trade off is that its too early to say whether it will be able to offer lower leverages as efficiently - if it could capture the 1-5x market that would be incredible. If in future it proves  able to without the risk being too big there would be a huge market of potential CEX traders who don't want to KYC for whatever reason (as I imagine tax liabilities of borrowing 900k on a CEX vary between places).\n\nAlso, not gonna lie finding this project also spurred me into learning a decent base of solidity and javascript to run a liquidation bot, which has been a frustrating but rewarding exercise. Pretty grateful as nothing had actually pushed me to learn about crypto stuff more deeply than the very basics until it even though Id been into crypto since 2013 and now I feel like I have a reasonable handle on web3js, how ethereum/polygon and its transactions work etc.",

Influencers get to create content or NFTs and users buy those contents with the $ELITE token, it actually shows a different kind of interaction between the celebrities and the users. Also if an NFT Is bought and held by a user, the Value increases according to how much more the content will be worth based on the social algorithm of the platform. I think it\u2019s success will be highly based on its marketing, but the idea is brilliant.",

They also range from companies that work in all possible areas from medical, automotive, DeFi, NFT, trading, staking, etc. This is to say that for an ecosystem like Oasis there are a lot of partners that focus on different aspects. And that is because a network like Oasis has so broad use cases and interests. \n\nIt would be useful to look at our roadmap to find our current interests, but let me just quickly mention a couple of things that we are currently working on. NFT and GameFi economies are very interesting to us, and we are working on integrating the building blocks and primitives that allow us to bootstrap those into our network. One company from our Metaminds x Accelerator program (another partner :D ), Rosart, already released their NFT Launchpad, and are launching their marketplace. Rosart is also becoming a partner to our other programs so that they can support other projects in our ecosystem, like the foundation has supported them. This way we facilitate success in all ways and cross generationally. \n\nAnother focuses of ours are DeFi and Confidentiality. Those are whole different stories, but with very similar dynamics as with Rosart. Ultimately, building success for a L1 revolves around partnerships as long term win-win situations are what it takes to be successful in this space.",

We\u2019re ramping up 2022 to be the year of growth and I\u2019ve developed and aggressive strategy that is fully deployed and in action. We have so many amazing events planned for our community and one of the best ways for them to get involved is our Ambassador Program!\r  \n \r  \n\ud83d\udce3Oasis Ambassador Program \ud83d\udce3\r  \n(https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/become-an-oasis-ambassador-and-build-a-responsible-data-economy-bbd38d0f9c12) which has a special incentive breakdown only available to ambassadors. The program has grown to over 500+ members including our China team, making local outreach easier than ever. We recently broke the 500 global ambassador milestone with many of our members in regions poised to explode with community support. We are highly underrated when it comes to our global presence and we are looking to change this in the upcoming quarters in a dramatic way.\r  \n\r  \nOur approach is that we attract high-quality Ambassadors from online communities just like this one. We grow and empower our Ambassadors to use the skills they have from their existing careers and interests. There are community content generation bounties, community engagement bounties, marketing bounties, BD bounties, and soon to launch our Ecosystem Ambassador Bounty Program. \ud83d\ude0e\r  \n\r  \nThe Ambassador program is a perfect onramp into the industry and we\u2019ve proudly helped many of our Ambassadors secure jobs within the industry!\r  \n\r  \nIf you are interested in our ambassador program, you can learn more about it here and earn $ROSE: https://oasisprotocol.org/ambassador-program\r  \n\r  \nWe are also currently focusing heavily on building the Defi 2.0 ecosystem and applications, and the NFT + P2E gaming ecosystem. As we speak there are a lot of teams deploying their applications to the Network via the acceleration and hackathon programs. Aside of the ones being developed its already possible to use some of the many DEXes and lending protocols, and to collect some amazing NFT sets \ud83e\udd73\r  \nOur current hackathon, The Oasis Bloom Hackathon, will raise brand awareness of Oasis within the developer community and yield some great dApps for our ecosystem. This hackathon facilitates the next generation of DApps for web3 & beyond in areas such as DeFi and P2E Gaming. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the support of our sponsors, Jump, NGC, Newman, Hashed and Dragonfly. The winning teams will also have access to potential investments and mentorship opportunities provided by the sponsors, especially for the winning teams.

You can \u201clend\u201d (rent) this token via smart contract with conditions, such as how much gas you\u2019ll allow being spent for how much time they\u2019re allowed to view the data (even select data for data queries without exposing the rest), it is then returned to you!

Some great areas for this are things like browser cookie data and ultimately even banking and transactions data. \r  \n \r  \nWe have a number of companies already developing such solutions on Parcel API and many upcoming in Cipher paratime.

Thanks for asking it :)  \n\n\nThe mainstream has a lot of use cases that can benefit from transposing existing web2 and offline process to a smart contract / decentralized system. Most of these currently, however, suffer from the public nature of all data stored on chain. If you just imagine, how many things would you store online if all of the information was publicly available. Things like all of your emails, your bank account transactions and location data can be stored on the blockchain but currently only in a public format where everyone has access to the same data.  \n\n\nNow this is obviously a sub optimal method of doing things, and this is what Oasis is here to solve. Our technology allows us to store all this information using blockchain but to keep it private simultaneously. That is what we believe will be the catalyst for mainstream adaptation. Timing wise we are actually really close now for that to happen, so I\u2019m expecting first mainstream applications using confidential data to roll out in 2022. And that\u2019s super exciting!",

It\u2019s also not technically following the rules, but after a long time of manual grinding I also discovered the ability to run multiple bots simultaneously which increased the efficiency of gameplay and most importantly, the amount of items that I was able to gather. \n\nThe thing is that back in that time there was no proper way to monetize the in-game assets you had. Only through shady websites was that possible, and sometimes people would also sell cracked items that got deleted after game patches as they were in reality not legit. NFTs address this crucial aspect: ability to buy and sell items, and to know that they are legitimate. In addition, blockchain games have a lot of possibilities for building reputation systems using on-chain activity to detect fraudulent behavior, something I should have been definitely banned for in my time :D\n\nThere is a strong trend currently towards P2E idle games that essentially function as NFT and token minting machines where they generate tokens and allow to breed assets to a certain point where the early players have gotten a strong enough position that it becomes inaccessible to the new players. In trading terms, I would be short on these type of projects.\n\nHowever, we are seeing a really cool wave of Triple A games announcing their GameFi and P2E economies which in trading terms I would be very bullish on. In the short term there definitely will be a lot of browser based P2E games getting a lot of hype, but in the long run the Triple A desktop / console games will most likely bring the GameFi space into the next level.",

Unlike a Parachain, a ParaTime does not need to do consensus itself, making it simpler to develop and more integrate into the network as a whole. ParaTimes take care of compute and discrepancy detection is used to ensure correctness and integrity of execution, making ParaTimes more efficient than Parachains and other chain designs that rely on sharding.  ParaTimes supports confidential compute, allowing it to support new and innovative use cases that require handling sensitive data and fixing many of the existing issues with DeFi such as front running. \r  \n \r  \nBecause ParaTimes separates consensus from compute, and puts little restrictions on the kind of compute environments that can be built, the Network has the ability to simultaneously support enterprise use cases, fully open compute networks, specialized runtimes for machine learning, AI, etc. This separation allows multiple ParaTimes to process transactions in parallel, meaning complex workloads processed on one ParaTime won\u2019t slow down faster, simpler transactions on another. This is a major source of bottlenecks and gas-fee expenses for most blockchains, inhibiting their wide-scale adoption. Separating PTs computation from each other and operating them with their own 'ParaTime engines' (virtual machines essentially) also enables Oasis to provide a holistic environment for PT occupiers.\r  \n \r  \nOur governance model ensures there is no competition within the ecosystem for support. An Inter-ParaTime communication protocol is on the roadmap for 2022 and it will be a total game changer as it will allow for dapps on different ParaTimes to share value and features with each other. We have Parcel, Emerald (our EVM compatible ParaTime) and  CIPHER (our WASM ParaTime) which will be adding privacy to the blockchain industry in a way never before enabled. Oasis is a great network for building scalable web3 applications that allow users to retain ownership of their own data, and to monetize it.Tokenized data is currently used in the Parcel environment by entities looking to benefit from the ease of integration through the Parcel API. \r  \n \r  \nOasis can protect your data/keep it private in applications, so that you retain ownership of your information and choose who can see it. On an application that takes advantage of this Oasis feature, if you don't want to share your data with others it's totally possible. Currently a lot of web2 services sell your information to third parties and make money off it without the end user knowing where their data is going, Oasis is making strides to create an internet where the end user can also benefit from this monetization, a responsible data economy.",

We all could use a little help in life and putting your ego aside and giving yourself permission to learn from someone you respect and admire is a quality worth possessing. \r  \n \r  \nI had the privilege of being mentored by the GM & President of the Metal Industries company I worked at throughout my 20\u2019s. He taught me the values of business, groomed me to understand contract negotiations tactics and pushed me to apply for leadership positions within the industry. He encouraged me to develop my skills in every way possible and taught me the cut-throat mentality required when it comes to business. I appreciate this man very much in my life and wouldn\u2019t be who I am today without his mentorship.\r  \n \r  \nSince I joined the Oasis team, Professor Dr. Dawn Song has been an inspiration to me and has been helping me take my career to the next level in this amazing industry of Blockchain. She encourages me to push my expectations higher, to have a more clear vision and to set our sights on goals that to many individuals, would see as impossible.

Since the project allows developers to use XRD's defi libraries and the Radix Engine to build their own DApps, it opens up a world of innovation from people with ideas. More developers contributing, more potential to find gems. I like to use Scrypto (to learn for now) for accessing Radix engine because it is written in Rust language and documentation is just \\[chef's kiss\\].\n\nThis is just an oversimplification but it is very robust and I'm definitely looking forward to that project's future and the developers using their ecosystem like myself.\n\nAnother gem which is very new but will offer another neat wallet idea is RoboInu Finance (RBIF). The person who started it was an ex-Google developer, and passed to an experienced software project lead, and she's been kicking ass, in my opinion. Since I'm really into community and collaboration, RBIF's culture has captured my interest. It's not about hyping, it's not about pumping, but about nourishing the community by continued support and offering solutions. RBIF has a special place in my heart. lol\n\nThe 2 products/solutions I'm very interested about are their flagship RoboWallet and RoboLaunchpad (which aligns with my interest for collaboration).\n\nRadixDLT is already a mature project while RoboInu Finance is still very very new. I think financially, you can gain a lot from RBIF in a year or 2. ;)",

The complexity of entering the crypto market for someone who has no knowledge about it. They will be the Apple of crypto. Make it so that a 75year old can easily be aware of projects and invest in them. \n\n2. Whale manipulations. How frustrated are we as retail investors to see whales draining profits over and over again. They hurt the chart. Well, Coyote Coin is implementing a Harpoon Tax to discourage whale dumps. If any wallet tries to sell more than 5% of the previous 24hr trading volume, the sell tax gets ratcheted up to about 33%, with 10% of that getting redistributed to holders.",
