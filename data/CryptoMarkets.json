            "text": "Bitcoin nowadays is showing sudden trend reversals, demonstrating the price changes ranging more than 42%. In the weekly time frame, the [BTC](https://swapzone.io/currencies/bitcoin) price has a chance to go beyond the $60,000 levels soon. \n\nMeanwhile, the third-biggest Bitcoin whale has jumped into accumulation mode after 2,822 BTC purchases in the past seven days. The whale is said to be the largest non-exchange entity that accumulated BTC worth $117 million in the past week.\n\nIf the whale is really accumulating the asset, then the demand may increase above the supply making the price to range high. And eventually, the [BTC](https://swapzone.io/currencies/bitcoin) price may witness a steep price swing.\n\nDo you believe that BTC price will hit new record anytime soon? Any thoughts?\n\n[\u00a0Source: bitcoinwarrior.net](https://preview.redd.it/q2e20d0awvu81.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=364288be423c8efea53cca76a628c562a758ab9d)",

Among them is Gavin Andresen, who published in 2014 the last email he received from Satoshi Nakamoto on April 26, 2011, just 11 years ago.\n\nBut before that, a few days earlier, he had exchanged emails with Mike Hearn, explaining on April 23, 2011, that he had moved on to other things than Bitcoin:\n\n>\"I've moved on to other things. It's in good hands with Gavin and everyone.\"\n\nDetails on these emails are published on Mike Hearn's page: [https://plan99.net/\\~mike/satoshi-emails/thread5.html](https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread5.html)\n\nOn April 26, 2011, he then sent his last known email to Gavin Andresen:\n\n>\"I wish you wouldn't keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure, the press just turns that into a pirate currency angle. Maybe instead make it about the open source project and give more credit to your dev contributors; it helps motivate them.\"\n\nEleven years after Satoshi Nakamoto's last known online message, no one still knows who this mysterious figure was who gave birth to an incredible monetary revolution that the world will be able to benefit from.\n\nLet's hope that his identity will remain a mystery forever, and let's focus on the Bitcoin project as he wanted, trying to get the most out of it for the most people. Which has been done very well so far.\n\nThe best is yet to come for the Bitcoin revolution.",

However, new data shows that talks of Russians are evading sanctions via crypto don\u2019t seem to be true.  \nAs per data from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, the ruble-denominated crypto activity on March 3 stood at $34.1 million. 1 million activity a week ago on February 24. The ruble-denominated crypto activity stood at a record $158 million in May 2021.  \nData from Citigroup also shows that the actual [**Bitcoin**](https://swapzone.io/currencies/bitcoin?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) buying from Russia just stood at an average of 210 BTC per day. Thus, Russia\u2019s buying power seems to have little impact on the crypto market. Probably, it could be because of renewed whale buying as reported by Coingape.\n\n*Russian volumes have been relatively small so far, suggesting that the price action is more due to investors positioning for an expected uptick in demand from Russia, rather than Russian demand itself. It will take meaningful capital flight to move the needle*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lnanby83adl81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a3fe41bf920f7db15e0e1bcfc9c4feff7df4466",

Are there other perks of big brother looking over crypto related Platforms like Coinbase, Binance, Tycoon or UniSwap? Or is this a lone benefit?\n\nThe DOJ explained that in August last year, fraudsters contacted the victim by phone claiming to be with the Office of the Inspector General, adding:\n\nThe fraudsters deceived the victim into believing his personal information had been used to facilitate a drug trafficking and money laundering scheme, and as a result all of the victim\u2019s assets would be frozen.\n\n\u201cOne of the imposters, who identified himself as agent James Hoffman, told the victim that he was required to deposit funds into a secure government account until the government verified that the victim was not involved in criminal activity,\u201d said the Justice Department.\n\nThe scammers further demanded all of the victim\u2019s personal identifying information and details regarding his financial accounts, the DOJ noted.",

(Image credit: Eliza Gkritsi/CoinDesk)\n\nThe difficulty of mining a bitcoin block dropped 0.35% on Thursday, the second time this month, after a consistent climb since November.\n\nOn March 3, mining difficulty dropped 1.5%, data from information platform Glassnode shows.\n\nThe difficulty adjusts automatically relative to the computing power on the network, also known as the hashrate, to keep the time between each mined block relatively stable at 10 minutes.\n\nThe bitcoin mining hashrate has dropped from an all-time high in February of 248 exahash/second (EH/s) to 216 EH/s on March 17, according to data from Glassnode.\n\n\"This slight drop is likely due to unprofitable miners unplugging ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). As energy prices increase globally, we will likely see more ASICs fall off the network,\" Compass Mining founder and CEO Whitt Gibbs.\n\nElectricity prices are soaring across the world as one of the world's largest exporters of fossil fuels, Russia, is enthralled in a war with Ukraine, and global energy supply chains are being severed by sanctions.\nI hope the global energy crisis is solved soon cos its effects can be seen in crypto space from PoW coins like Bitcoin to crypto trading platforms like Coinbase and Tycoon. \n\n\"My bet is that Kazakh miners going offline due to electricity shortages and a government crackdown on illegal mining caused the drop,\" Jaran Mellerud, researcher at Oslo-based Arcane Research.",

In reaction to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, US President Joe Biden announced on Thursday that he had authorized \"\"tough sanctions.\"\" These sanctions attempt to impede Russia's capacity to transact in dollars and other major foreign currencies, and involve fines on five Russian banks with a combined asset value of $1 trillion.\n\n A large number of Russian elites, as well as their family members, will be targeted. All of this is on top of the fines levied earlier this week. \nAs crypto is getting more widely used, me and the people around me started crypto to hold their money in projects like Parrotly Finance and the top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In a government that is taking steps to legalize cryptocurrencies and where the digital assets are already widely held, such punishments may be less effective.\n\n Typically, countries utilize physical workarounds to dodge sanctions, such as Venezuela and North Korea's use of petroleum transfers from ship to ship, but digital assets such as cryptocurrency and decentralized exchanges might become the most effective approach to avoid fines.",

There are some projects utilizing synthetic tokens where rewards get released based on adoption rather than a fixed time frame.\nDaFi protocol has been doing this for a while now and they saw great success off of it so you should be safe investing in similar projects.\n\nYou don\u2019t necessarily have to go all in with these projects. Just invest a very moderate amount. Even a small amount of money can end up being a huge sum if that project ends up pumping hard (as startups usually do)",

The crypto sector as a whole is by now familiar with DeFi, and the pros and cons that come with it.\n\nGameFi has the potential to alter that by bringing its crypto tokens to an entire generation of developing/rural economies through a simple smartphone game. Take Axie, for example. Fifty percent of those who began playing the game had never heard of Bitcoin before.\n\nWhile games like Axie have high entrance hurdles, it's obvious that chains like Ethereum are proving to be a problem for these newly bred P2Es which require an insane amount of on-chains transcations, ETH doesn't really scale with that, also most p2e games are very low effort nowadays.\n\nA lot of major corporates are taking the leap and joining the Crypto space each in their own way, for example **Ubisoft** (the gaming giant) announced a partnership with the HBAR Foundation which is an entity dedicated to rapidly funding Innovators and entrepreneurs in the Hedera economy, it's been aggressively expanding the ecosystem and this partnership with Ubisoft is a huge milestone.\n\nI really think Hedera is a good choice seeing how fast that network is, it can reach a TPS up to 100K in addition to txn fees costing $0.0001, pretty impressive stuff if you ask me. I think news like this is really beneficial since people will be able to engage in high quality P2E while also paying minimal fees and not having to worry about reliability or downtime.",

There are many companies that\u2019ll take bitcoin  as payment now, like amazon, starbucks, paypal etc. \n\nThis being said if you\u2019re trying to invest in bitcoin or other currencies. Those who are starting out might choose exchanges like coinbase, kraken or binance just to name a few that have a \u201cwallet\u201d so you can store all of your digital currencies.\n\nCrypto Wallets come in many forms, \u201chot\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d wallets. Hot wallets are for online storage use. Cold wallets are offline hardware storage devices. \n\nI have compiled a few wallets that have caught my eye and maybe yours.\n\nExodus: It has no fees and is a hot wallet. It offers crypto exchange services for your desktop, phone and hardware crypto wallets. Gives you live charts and 24/7, 365 days a year customer support.\n\nSquirrel Wallet: Has no fees and private keys are not  required and if you\u2019re a mobile user you can control your assets from your device. This smart wallet will be a game changer when it is released. Rather than relying on controlling your wallet through a private key. This wallet\u2019s code is utilized and allows features to be programmed directly into the wallet. Having the ability to recover lost wallets without the need for seed phrases. Don\u2019t let the name fool you. \n\nElectrum: This wallet is for my advanced users and it specializes in private key encryption and two factor authentication. Just like Exodus, Electrum is a hot wallet that gives you online encryption. Also offering many interfaces like phone and desktop.\n\nI can go on and on about wallets, honorable mentions would be metamask, trust wallet, ledger, etc. etc. With the popularity of crypto I think the topic of having a wallet is missed. Just because you have some crypto in Robinhood doesn\u2019t mean it belongs to you. They belong to robinhood.",

This wouldn\u2019t make any sense, and people would probably stop using those services.\n\nBlockchains like Bitcoin have been using a system called Proof of Work consensus mechanism. Proof of Work systems requires powerful computer hardware to solve arbitrary mathematical puzzles in order to validate the transactions on the blockchain, while mining tokens and reinforcingdecentralization.\n\nMany compete to have the very best hardware system, so they can get bigger rewards, often creating a huge mass of fancy equipment to one-up everyone else, these could be referred to as mining hubs.\n\nThe mass amounts of electricity required to run these mining hubs are not the most eco-friendly *(imagine the electricity bill!)*. Not only that but if one person controlled 51% of the network\u2019s computational power the network would be compromised, thus defeating the purpose of decentralization, which is a huge con for the Proof of Work consensus.\n\nEthereum apps have tried their hand at fixing these shortcomings and decreasing the amount of time it takes to validate a transaction byimplementing something called a \u2018layer 2 scaling solution\u2019. Simply put, this just means that every time the blockchain has transactions to process, they are grouped in \u2018bundles\u2019 which are then added back to the main blockchain once they have been given the a-o\\* \\* kay. This improvedsomething called scalability, or the capacity of the blockchain to allow for more transactions at a quicker rate.\n\nHowever, just like any simple process you then add a lot of new steps to, it becomes very complicated. More complications = less security. In a way, we\u2019ve now traded one problem for another.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You might be asking, you thought this article was about Avalanche, right? Correct! Despite the trials and tribulations of networks before their time, they HAVE been able to achieve a decentralized layer 1 protocol that is highly scalable AND secure! Avalanche has claimed itself to be the \u201cfastest smart contracts platform in the blockchain industry, as measured by time-to-finality.\u201d (No worries if you are confused on the concept of time-to-finality, it is covered later on in this article as it pertains to Avalanche, we've got your back!)\n\nBefore we can take a bite of the meat of what Avalanche is, we\u2019ve got to start at the beginning...

I have absolutely nothing to do where I currently live so my plan is to leave his Twitter open while I play through Halo CE and borderlands 2. The moment he tweets some dribble and if it's on the exchange with my Bitcoin I'll buy immediately and sell after I'm happy with the profits. I'll compare to my main portfolio and see where it ends up.\n\nEdit: after some math I realised I only need to make 39% profit on each trade to achieve this. Fun fact, using similar math and a well known calculation you only need 10 trades/cycles of 7.2% gains to double your money!\n\nEdit 2: Added a name for this after lying in bed unable to sleep - The 7 days of Christmas challenge as it starts on Christmas day for me in Australia.\n\nEdit 3: RIP inbox, away from home for Christmas so waking up on Christmas morning to so many comments albeit remind me in 1 week was pretty cool.\n\n4: Day 1 was a failure, not on cryptopia like all the past ones. tried it with some money I had on bittrex but it truly seems bots have taken over and instantly cause connection issues when you go to that exchange pair....\n\nAlso thank you for the Reddit gold kind stranger, was a nice Christmas present :), this individual a long with 4 others have asked me to add a dogecoin address for future projects so I have. \n\nTo be clear I am not asking for donations or money at all, anything donated will be stored and eventually donated to charity. If I actually get some donations to this address I'm thinking id run a poll for the community to vote to determine where the coins should be invested. After a year of hodling and perhaps several more polls to adjust the portfolio any money will be donated to charity. Again I have been asked to do this and replied to these people saying I don't want to look like I'm asking for money, I do however think this would be a cool idea to have a community run portfolio to give to needy causes.\n\nDogecoin - D6CXrdL7H85rBwA5UiQGTBad36SiexmXEy\n\nEdit: incase you guys haven't realised I already made an updated post, at work so I can't really find it right now.

I'm kidding, but try not too rub it too hard into anyone's face, and also know that you're willingly playing his game of manipulation. So realize your gains asap\n\nGood luck!",

            "text": "I noticed that in those subreddits more and more beginners are posting and advertising coins - mostly not because they really understand the tech behind it - but to pump it up. So beginners are trying to fool other beginners.Now i decided to write down some basic advice to avoid mistakes.  \n\n1) only play with money you can afford to lose.\n\n\n2) NEVER EVER make a buy or sell that is triggered by a feeling of 'not wanting to miss out on a sudden development'. also known as fomo: fear of missing out. Invariably, you will make bad decisions if you do.\n\n\n3) never buy on a sudden upswing. Especially if you don't know why it's swinging up. You may be buying into a hype curve triggered by other people's fomo. When that happens, you'll lose big in the correction that follows. The one exception is if you see a spike and then also find a good reason. When segwit was finally locked in for bitcoin, all the uncertainty ended and the price shot up for a very good reason. Jumping on that train can be a good decision.\n\n\n4) when you finally take a profit and sell, walk away. Don't keep looking at the price. If you do and you see it going beyond the sell price, you may be tempted to jump in again and take a bit more profit. Not only do you pay 2 extra transaction fees, but you will also risk buying into an overshoot which corrects 2 minutes later, and you lose the profits you realized 5 minutes earlier.\n\n\n5) understand that by playing carefully and with consideration, you may actually miss an occasional coin suddenly increasing in price. that is not to be helped. However, it also means that you are not making a lot of blind gambles that will cost you a lot of money.\n\n\n6) do some research, and only buy into projects for which you actually understand the purpose and which you believe may work in real life. a coin needs more than fanboys shills to be valuable long term.\n\n\n7) be very carefull when buying during a time period when there is a lot of euphoria and all coins are going strong. If the entire market is going strong, all coins do well, even the shitty ones\n\n\n8) learn to recognize pump and dump cycles and avoid them. the saying in poker is: if you don't know who the sucker is, it's you. don't be the sucker.\n\n\n9) look at the long term prices and use baselines, triangles and fibonaci and try to think of what you think the correct value to buy is. with some basic effort you can figure it out and set the buy order and walk away.\n\n\n10) Do NOT try to play the game of buying and selling dips. buy dips if you want to play that game, but don't sell with the idea of buying back shortly after to game the dip. this is a good recipe for disaster. If you were holding NEO 2 days ago when it was 0.0039 BTC and sold with the idea of buying back at 0.0033, you'd be cursing yourself badly now that it shot up to 0.0064\n\n\n11) when buying, don't just look at the timeline, also look at the order book. If you see big sell walls that are not balanced by buy walls, it may be better to wait for the price to drop some more.\n\n\n12) doing the things above takes time and consideration. you will miss out from time to time by waiting to long, but you will also not make catastrophic errors. Also long as your positions are string, you can continue to keep playing the game.\n\n\nOk this was more than I had planned to write down, and nothing in it was rocket science, but it may help beginners. I surely did not start making decent profits until I started doing this.",

The thing you\u2019ve researched and know is sound, and would bet your entire trading stack on if someone put a gun to your head.\n\nI have thought for cryptodecades (so like 1 year) that ETH was, and continues to be, undervalued relative to the market.  Hence it\u2019s my personal blue chip.\n\nGiven that the first thing people want to do when panicking is to \u201csell back to fiat\u201d, you\u2019ll note that lots of your funds are usually only convertible to another crypto on most exchanges.  So regardless of what you want to do, you basically cannot make it home to fiat quickly.  What to do?\n\nInstead of panicking - either hold fast in what you\u2019ve got OR retreat but retreat to something YOUVE done research on and think is blue chip (for some it\u2019s BTC, others it\u2019s NEO, others it\u2019s VeChain, others it\u2019s some combo, etc etc).  That way even when \u201ceverything is going down\u201d, if you took a few moonshots and they look terrible, you at least always KNOW where intermediate homebase is.  If you haven\u2019t thought of this stuff yet, well you should have, but thankfully Reddit\u2019s community has vetted certain names over and over again and for all the flack people here get, there actually ARE decent and great traders on this site.  If you\u2019re invested and panicking and are a noob and don\u2019t know the above names, get to work here and see which one of the names you like.\n\nAnd, if you do do such a thing and retreat, I\u2019d suggest just hanging on for a bit in that position. If your blue chip is getting hammered \u2014 well that\u2019s just what sometimes happens in crypto, and a correction back up will occur because the underlying cryptofundamentals are, relatively speaking, good.  Also, note the overall marketcap - cryptoblues usually only get hammered when the ENTIRE marketcap is going down.  And if that\u2019s happening, remember that history has recently shown that 100-200 billion dollar swings in the overall MC happen quite readily.  \n\nNot rocket science but I feel today newbies might be nervous.  Keep your heads in the game.  As someone here once said, it takes balls of steel to create wealth - and those balls are only necessary when the market is going DOWN, not up.",

Here are the five lessons learned so far.\n\n1) Never sell for loss. Market is still evolving quite rapidly and there are more chances that your investment is going to increase from your buying price in due course even if it's at loss presently. A bit of patience will be fruitful later.\n\n2) Never fall prey to FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) and FOMO (fear of moving in). Remember that old saying - grass is always greener on the other side. Do some research and keep believing in your investment.\n\n3) Alts always seem to go down when bitcoin is swinging wildly, no matter which direction bitcoin is moving. However, they catch up pretty quickly once bitcoin stablizes. Therefore don't panic sell if you see a plunge.\n\n4) Prices almost always tend to correct/go down after a brisk increase or all time high.\n\n5) No-one can predict the price of a coin, so, if anyone is doing so he must be misleading. Fundamental/technical analysis can help predict the trend though.\n\nAbove all, keep faith in the almighty, and your coins will MOON one day!!\n",

            "text": "Lots of people have PM'd me asking me the same questions on where to find information and how to put together their portfolio so I decided to put a guide for crypto investors, especially those who have only been in a few months and are still confused.\n\nMany people entered recently at a time when the market was rewarding the very worst type of investment behavior. Unfortunately there aren't many guides and a lot of people end up looking at things like Twitter or the trending Youtube crypto videos, which is dominated by \"How to make $1,00,000 by daytrading crypto\" and influencers like CryptoNick.\n\nSo I'll try to put together a guide from what I've learned and some tips, on how to invest in this asset class. This is going to be Part 1, in another post later I'll post a systematic approach to valuation and picking individual assets.\n\n#Getting started: Tools and resources\n---------------------------\n\nYou don't have to be a programmer or techie to invest in crypto, but you should first learn the basics of how it functions. I find that [this video by 3Blue1Brown is the best introduction to what a blockchain actually is and how it functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4), because it explains it clearly and simply with visuals while not dumbing it down too much.  If you want a more ELI5 version with cute cartoons, then [Upfolio](http://www.upfolio.com) has a nice beginner's intro to the blockchain concept and [quick descriptions of top 100 cryptocurrencies](https://www.upfolio.com/100-coins-explained). I also recommend simply going to Wikipedia and reading the blockchain and cryptocurrency page and clicking onto a few links in, read about POS vs POW...etc. Later on you'll need this information to understand why a specific use case may or may not benefit from a blockchain structure. Here is a [quick summary of the common terms](http://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/a-quick-guide-to-cryptocurrency-terms) you should know.\n\nNext you should arm yourself with some informational resources. I compiled a convenient list of useful tools and sites that I've used and find to be worthy of bookmarking:\n\n**Market information**\n\n* http://coinmarketcal.com - Keeping tabs of everything going on in crypto is tough, wouldn't it be great if there was some sort of calendar? Well this is a calendar of upcoming crypto events, whether its conferences, product releases, burns, exchange listings...etc. You can also filter by types of events, coins and month. \n\n* http://coin.fyi - Great for following the news related to a specific cryptocurrencies\n\n* http://cryptopanic.com - An aggregator of various crypto sites and news, filterable. \n\n* http://coinspectator.com - Another aggregator from over a 100 different sources of crypto news.\n\n* https://www.ccowl.com/news - News from major sites (CoinDesk, Cointelegram, Bloomberg...etc) on one page \n\n* http://cci30.com - Kind of like the S&P500 for crypto, its an index of the 30 biggest cryptocurrencies\n\n* http://eveningstar.io - this is basicall trying to be the Morning Star for cryptos\n\n* http://icotracker.net - I like this site for looking at what ICO are coming up\n\n* http://www.icoalert.com - Another good site for upcoming ICO tracking\n\n* http://icodrops.com - More ICO listings and they have a \"hype\" rating \n\n* http://bitcointalk.org - Probably the biggest crypto community, lots of Bitcoin old timers who have seen it all\n\n* Both [Medium](http://medium.com/topic/cryptocurrency) and [Steemit](http://steemit.com/trending/cryptocurrency) have plenty of blogs to follow depending on what interests you within crypto\n\n* Telegram is the preferred chat platform, just stay away from PnD groups (same for Discord PnD groups)\n\n\n\n**Analysis tools**\n\n\n* http://cryptowat.ch - Great charting tool owned by Kraken that gives you a pretty wide look at various cryptos across most major exchanges.\n\n* http://coinmonsta.io/metrics - Want to see what the most shilled coins are on Twitter? This ranking multiplies the number of tweets vs. sentiment estimate to arrive at a score.\n\n* http://onchainfx.com - A better version of coin market cap, has all sort of columns and you can add flags. Also I like their market segmentation filters. \n\n* http://www.sifrdata.com/ - Great visualizations of various metrics. I find their correlations to be very useful.\n\n* http://www.coingecko.com - includes useful information about crypto like the breakdown volume by fiat currency, social media stats, code repository stats..etc\n\n* http://www.tradingview.com/chart/ - the best charting site that I use for stocks, however it has plenty of major cryptos\n\n* http://www.iconomi.net/dashboard - basically forms different ETFs out of cryptos. Not a bad place to get ideas for your portfolio.\n\n* http://cointrading.ninja/correlation - See a matrix of price movement correlatiosn between various cryptocurrencies over various periods.\n\n* http://coinmarketcap.com - Useful for scanning the market, and finding the blockchain explorer and official website for each individual crypto. Their API is also quite useful for Excel based analysis.\n\n* http://icobench.com - Another ICO tracker which does nice summaries, shows teams, milestones, financials and gives a rating for each IC\n\n* http://cryptomaps.org - Visualization of price across different segments, primarily hashing functions and ICO release dates\n\n* http://solume.io - compares the number of Twitter mention increase decrease to price\n\n* http://www.badbitcoin.org - a list of all the known scam sites. Check this list before joining something.\n\n\n**Portfolio Tracking**\n\n* Delta and Blockfolio are the major mobile apps, I personally recommend Delta. \n\n* For desktop [I prefer to use a CoinMarketCap API Excel tracker](http://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7m3nvy/ive_created_an_excel_crypto_portfolio_tracker/) that automatically draws live data from CoinMarketCap. Customize it to your own liking. There are also plenty of online tracking sites like AltPocket but I've never used them so can't recommend one.\n\n**Youtube**\n\n\nI generally don't follow much on Youtube because it's dominated by idiocy like Trevon James and CryptoNick, but there are some that I think are worthy of following:\n\n* Crypto Investor - A background in finance gives Crypto Investor a much more nuanced approach, and he is very insightful in terms of investor behavioral psychology. Listening to his negativity and criticism of parabolic price action in a sea of lambo chasing is refreshing.\n\n* CoinMastery - Carter Thomas takes on a rational mid-term to long term approach to investing in crypto, and has been a voice of reason many times.\n\n* DataDash - He's more focused on trading, but I still like him for his news summaries and overall decent content.\n\n* IvanOnTech - Brings a programmers perspective, goes through the Github and explains many programming issues with blockchains.\n\n\n\n#Constructing a Investment Strategy\n---------------------------\n\nI can't stress enough how important it is to construct an actual investment strategy. Organize what your goals are, what your risk tolerance is and how you plan to construct a portfolio to achieve those goals rather than just chasing the flavor of the week.\n\nWhy? Because it will force you to slow down and make decisions based on rational thinking rather than emotion, and will also inevitably lead you to think long term.\n\n#Setting ROI targets\n---------------------------\n\nBluntly put, a lot of young investors who are in crypto have really unrealistic expectations about returns and risk.\n\nA lot of them have never invested in any other type of financial asset, and hence many seem to consider a 10% ROI in a month to be unexciting, even though that is roughly what they should be aiming for.\n\nI see a ton of people now on this sub and on other sites making their decisions with the expectation to double their money every month. This has lead a worrying amount of newbies putting in way too much money way too quickly into anything on the front page of CoinMarketCap with a low dollar value per coin hoping that crypto get them out of their debt or a life of drudgery in a cubicle. And all in the next year or two!  \n\nBut its important to temper your hype about returns and realize why we had this exponential growth in the last year. The only reason we saw so much upward price action is because of fiat monetary base expansion from people FOMO-ing in due to media coverage. People are hoping to ride the bubble and sell to a greater fool in a few months, it is classic Greater Fool Theory. That's it. Its not because we are seeing any mass increase in adoption or actual widespread utility with cryptocurrency. We passed the $1,000 psychological marker again for Bitcoin which we hadn't seen since right before the Mt.Gox disaster, and it just snowballed the positivity as headline after headline came out about the price growth. However those unexciting returns of 10% a month are not only the norm, but much more healthy for an alternative investment class. Here are the annual returns for Bitcoin for the last few years:\n\nYear | BTC Return\n------|-------\n2017 | 1,300%\n2016 | 120%\n2015 | 35%\n2014 | -60%\n2013 | 5300%\n2012 | 150 % \n\nKeep in mind that a 10% monthly increase when compounded equals a 313% annual return, or over 3x your money. That may not sound exciting to those who entered recently and saw their money go 20x in a month on something like Tron before it crashed back down, but that 3X annual return is better than Bitcoin's return every year except the year right before the last market meltdown and 2017. I have been saying for a while now that we are due for a major correction and every investor now should be planning for that possibility through proper allocation and setting return expectations that are reasonable.\n\n**How to set a realistic ROI target**\n\nHow do I set my own personal return target? \n\nBasically I aim to achieve a portfolio return of roughly 385% annually (3.85X increase per year) or about 11.89% monthly return when compounded. How did I come up with that target? I base it on the average compounded annual growth return (CAGR) over the last 3 years on the entire market:\n\nYear  | Total Crypto Market Cap \n-------|------\nJan 1, 2014:|  $10.73 billion \nJan 1, 2017:  | $615 billion\n\n>Compounded annual growth return (CAGR):  (615/10.73)^(1/3) = 385%\n\nMy personal strategy is to sell my portfolio every December then buy back into the market at around the beginning of February and I intend to hold on average for 3 years, so this works for me but you may choose to do it a different way for your own reasons. I think this is a good average to aim for as a general guideline because it includes both the good years (2017) and the bad (2014). Once you have a target you can construct your risk profile (low risk vs. high risk category coins) in your portfolio. If you want to try for a higher CAGR than about 385% then you will likely need to go into more highly speculative picks. I can't tell you what return target you should set for yourself, but just make sure its not depended on you needing to achieve continual near vertical parabolic price action in small cap shillcoins because that isn't sustainable. \n\nAs the recent January dip showed while the core cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum would dip an X percentage, the altcoins would often drop double or triple that amount. Its a very fragile market, and the type of dumb behavior that people were engaging in that was profitable in a bull market (chasing pumps, going all in on a microcap shillcoin, having an attention span of a squirrel...etc) will lead to consequences. Just like they jumped on the crypto bandwagon without thinking about risk adjusted returns, they will just as quickly jump on whatever bandwagon will be used to blame for the deflation of the bubble, whether the blame is assigned to Wall Steet and Bitcoin futures or Asians or some government. \n\nNobody who pumped money into garbage without any use case or utility will accept that they themselves and their own unreasonable expectations for returns were the reason for the gross mispricing of most cryptocurrencies.\n\n#Risk Management\n---------------------------\n\nQuanitifying risk in crypto is surprisingly difficult because the historical returns aren't normally distributed, meaning that tools like Sharpe Ratio and other risk metrics can't really be used as intended. Instead you'll have to think of your own risk tolerance and qualitatively evaluate how risky each crypto is based on the team, the use case prospects, the amount of competition and the general market risk. \n\nYou can think of each crypto having a risk factor that is the summation of the general crypto market risk (Rm) as ultimately everything is tied to how Bitcoin does, but also its own inherent risk specific to its own goals (Ri).\n\nRt = Rm +Ri\n\nThe market risk is something you cannot avoid, if some China FUD comes out about regulations on Bitcoin then your investment in solid altcoin picks will go down too along with Bitcoin. This (Rm) return is essentially what risk you undertake to have a market ROI of 385% I talked about above. What you can minimize though is the Ri, the aset specific risks with the team, the likelihood they will actually deliver, the likelihood that their solution will be adopted. Unfortunately there is no one way to do this, you simply have to take the time to research and form your own opinion on how risky it really is before allocating a certain percentage to it. Consider the individual risk of each crypto and start looking for red flags:\n\n* guaranteed promises of large returns (protip: that's a Ponzi)\n\n* float allocations that give way too much to the founder\n\n* vague whitepapers\n\n* vague timelines\n\n* no clear use case\n\n* Github with no useful code and sparse activity\n\n* a team that is difficult to find information on or even worse anonymous\n\nWhile all cryptocurrencies are a risky investments but generally you can break down cryptos into \"low\" risk core, medium risk speculative and high risk speculative\n\n* Low Risk Core - This is the exchange pairing cryptos and those that are well established. These are almost sure to be around in 5 years, and will recover after any bear market. Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum are in this class of risk, and I would also argue Monero. \n\n* Medium Risk Speculative - These would be cryptos which generally have at least some product and are reasonably established, but higher risk than Core. Things like ZCash, Ripple, NEO..etc. \n\n* High Risk Speculative - This is anything created within the last few months, low caps, shillcoins, ICOs...etc. Most cryptos are in this category, most of them will be essentially worthless in 5 years.\n\nHow much risk should you take on? That depends on your own life situation but also it should be proportional to how much expertise you have in both financial analysis and technology. If you're a newbie who doesn't understand the tech and has no idea how to value assets, your risk tolerance should be lower than a programmer who understand the tech or a financial analyst who is experienced in valuation metrics. \n\nRight now the trio of BTC-ETH-LTC account for 55% of the market cap, so between 50-70% of your portfolio in low Risk Core for newbies is a great starting point. Then you can go down to 25-30% as you gain confidence and experience. But always try to keep about 1/3rd in safe core positions. Don't go all in on speculative picks.\n\n**Core principles to minimize risk**\n\n* Have the majority of your holdings in things you feel good holding for at least 2 years. Don't use the majority of your investment for day trading or short term investing.\n\n* Consider using dollar cost averaging to enter a position. This generally means investing a X amount over several periods, instead of at once. You can also use downward biased dollar cost averaging to mitigate against downward risk. For example instead of investing $1000 at once in a position at market price, you can buy $500 at the market price today then set several limit orders at slightly lower intervals (for example $250 at 5% lower than market price, $250 at 10% lower than market price). This way your average cost of acquisition will be lower if the crypto happens to decline over the short term.\n\n* Never chase a pump. Its simply too risky as its such an inefficient and unregulated market. If you continue to do it, most of your money losing decisions will be because you emotionally FOMO-ed into gambling on a symbol.\n\n* Invest what you can afford to lose. Don't have more than 5-10% of your net worth in crypto.\n\n* Consider what level of loss you can't accept in a position with a high risk factor, and use stop-limit orders to hedge against sudden crashes. Set you stop price at about 5-10% above your lowest limit. Stop-limit orders aren't perfect but they're better than having no hedging strategy for a risky microcap in case of some meltdown. Only you can determine what bags you are unwilling to hold.\n\n* Diversify across sectors and rebalance your allocations periodically. Keep about 1/3rd in low risk core holdings.\n\n* Have some fiat in reserve at a FDIC-insured exchange (ex. Gemini), and be ready to add to your winning positions on a pullback.\n\n* Remember you didn't actually make any money until you take some profits, so take do some profits when everyone else is at peak FOMO-ing bubble mode. You will also sleep much more comfortably once you take out the equivalent of your principal.\n\n\n\n#Portfolio Allocation\n---------------------------------------------\n\nAlong with thinking about your portfolio in terms of risk categories described above, I really find it helpful to think about the segments you are in. [OnChainFX](http://onchainfx.com/) has some segment categorization but I generally like to bring it down to:\n\n* Core holdings - essentially the Low Risk Core segment\n\n* Platform segment\n\n* Privacy segment\n\n* Finance/Bank settlement segment \n\n* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment\n\n* Promising/Innovative Tech segment \n\nThis is merely what I use, but I'm sure you can think of your own. The key point I have is to try to invest your medium and high risk picks in a segment you understand well, and in which you can relatively accurately judge risk. If you don't understand anything about how banking works or SWIFT or international settlement layers, don't invest in Stellar. If you have no idea how a supply chain functions, avoid investing in VeChain (even if it's being shilled to death on Reddit at the moment just like XRB was last month). \n\nWhat's interesting is that often we see like-coin movement, for example when a coin from one segment pumps we will frequently see another similar coin in the same segment go up (think Stellar following after Ripple).\n\nConsider the [historic correlations between your holdings](https://cointrading.ninja/correlation). Generally when Bitcoin pumps, altcoins dump but at what rate depends on the coin. When Bitcoin goes sideways we tend to see pumping in altcoins, while when Bitcoin goes down, everything goes down.\n\nYou should set price targets for each of your holdings, which is a whole separate discussion I'll go in Part 2 of the guide.\n\n#Summing it up\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis was meant to get you think about what return targets you should set for your portfolio and how much risk you are willing to take and what strategies you can follow to mitigate that risk. \n\nReturns around 385% (average crypto market CAGR over the last 3 years) would be a good target to aim for while remaining realistic, you can tweak it a bit based on your own risk tolerance. What category of risk your individual crypto picks should be will be determined by how much more greed you have for above average market return. A portfolio of 50% core holdings, 30% medium risk in a sector you understand well and 20% in high risk speculative is probably what the average portfolio should look like, with newbies going more towards 70% core and only 5% high risk speculative. \n\nJust by thinking about these things you'll likely do better than most crypto investors, because most don't think about this stuff, to their own detriment. \n\n",

            "text": "I keep seeing people post about Evergrande making interest payments on time and that the world is good again. I used to work on a bulge bracket Asia HY bond desk and this is not the case. \n\nTwitter and the Media is missing the full picture and no one has pointed it out yet. \ud83d\udc47\n\nWe aren\u2019t fully out of the woods. There is a difference between onshore (denominated in CNY) and offshore bonds (USD). Evergrande has offshore coupon denominated in USD due Sep 23 and have yet to make an announcement on those. Given a choice, they would pay onshore first. Should they decide not to pay USD, this will hurt global investors regardless. That said, there is still a 30-day grace period so it\u2019s not end of the world, even if they don\u2019t. \n\nThe CCP won\u2019t directly step in but they will save the house buyers in the case of a default (so they don\u2019t see any protesting etc). SOE banks will be the first to get screwed and majority of loans/commercial papers are to them. The scary part is that we\u2019re not too sure how many of these guys re-levered this debt into other instruments so there may be ticking bombs all around. \n\nUltimately, the nearest USD coupon that is due is on Sept 23rd (Thursday), roughly equating to US$100m in interest. Sure, you may meet that interest but the company still has $300bn of principal coupon worth to pay. \n\nPersonally, I see a few routes moving forward but one needs to look at the debt structure (1). horizontally (time-based) and (2). vertically (who and what type of debt do they hold) to see a better picture.\n\nHorizontally:\n- Sept 23, $83mio in interest due\n- Sept 29, $45mio in interest due\n- Oct 11, $~160mio in interest due\n- Nov 6, $80mio in interest due\n- Dec 28, $250mio in interest due\n\nVertically:\n- 54% of its $300bn are in secured borrowings\n- 2% are convertible bonds (lower pecking order)\n- 21% are senior notes (this is mostly held by UHNW individuals and big funds/banks)\n- 6% PRC bonds (local onshore denominated debt)\n- 17% Unsecured direct bank borrowings (mostly to SOE banks)\n\nThat said, my gutfeel is that the CCP will go in indirectly via the SOE banks taking the brunt of the hurt; they\u2019ll likely working their butts off now with some meeting of sort with all EVERRE\u2019s biggest debt/equity backers. The key players in this game are:\n\n[In order of importance to the CCP]. \n1. People who bought homes (they will be taken care off first)\n2. Suppliers and construction companies contracted (perhaps this may be next)\n3. Public debt holders (UHNW/Funds/Banks) \u2013 the key people here are the funds/banks\n4. SOE banks who provided direct loans (govt backed anyways)\n5. Equity holders. \n\nMy guess at the end: some SOE banks come in with some package to save certain pieces of the above pie. Perhaps the CEO/management team gets reprimanded strongly? Either ways, this is the largest elephant in the room now and the Crypto market is worried of the repercussions and quakes that we could feel from this fallout.\n\nThat said... enough about Evergrande, Crypto is dealing with its own troubles. Messari's Mainnet event got hijacked by a SEC subpoena, Mr Gensler called stablecoins 'poker chips' (we get it), and Binance derivatives service got clamped down in Australia.\n\nOn-chain data wise: During the dip, BTC's LTH-SOPR (1.26) vs STH-SOPR (0.97) indicated short-term holders (speculators, swing-traders, etc.) sold into losses, while long-term holders took profit. Regardless, the stablecoin supply ratio fell, and the exchange reserves of BTC is nearing a six-month low. This suggest traders are flushed with cash, but whether they are willing to step in (presumably on long leverage positions) is another question. For the second day, BTC Long liquidation also indicated a sharp up spike relative to the past 12 days while the estimated leverage ratio hovered at the mid-point (relative to the past two weeks), suggesting a very risk-off environment.\n\nIn derivatives: BTC and ETH option contract open interest held constant while traders adopted a wait-and-see approach to prices. Options skew indicators reflect a different story: 25% delta skew (Volatility premium for puts to calls), a significant jump, reflecting a high belief among option traders that further downward movement is imminent. Coin days destroyed also show that the move was mostly driven by short-term traders. \n\nPersonally, I like to fade such event-driven markets (but only post FOMC). Just note that conditions are primed such that if we get very positive news, people are flushed with cash for a jolt back to risk. A gentle nudge to also remember just how short-term market participant thinks, and that one only needs to look just over the ridge to stay ahead. IMO, the Evergrande fiasco is starting to look more like a very controlled detonation by the CCP - even if their offshore entity defaults (after the 30-day grace period), it won\u2019t trigger a cross-default to its onshore entity. Finally\u2026 I actually took Gary Gensler Washington Post interview early this morning to be bullish for Crypto long term. We certainly need certain aspects of the market to be reined in to progress further. Have a good one!\n\n- I write daily thoughts on Bitcoin/Crypto/TradFi for fun on Telegram too but I\u2019m looking to start here! Some redditors have posted on my behalf on other channels too / most of which I can\u2019t due to the lack of karma \ud83d\ude02",

            "text": "This is a comment I made in another post, and I would like to share for anyone who's interested in refining their strategy with Crypto trading.\n\nAfter 1+ years of trading crypto, I've learned a lot about investing and trading. I started like many of us have--going with whatever was being shilled or mooning. Of course, I lost a LOT of money that way, and slowly my investment strategy has developed. I've learned a few key things. I sleep soundly at night, and rarely check prices/news because of the strategy.\n\n1. The number one thing I'm looking for is a technology with an actual, practical use in the future. I just saw a post about \"OilCoin\"--supposedly it will be a coin that will be SEC-compliant and match the price of a barrel of oil. WHO CARES? There is almost no point to that coin, except that it might be stable, and it has team members that worked for the government. This leads to my next criteria...\n\n2. A good *business-savvy* team. I don't care if you have the top software engineer from Stanford and a 20-year Wall Street veteran. In fact, seeing people from Wall Street on the team gives me automatic thoughts of a pnd scheme run by someone who knows how to pnd. I want someone leading the business that has a long past of successful sales and business partnership experience--and not a \"serial entrepreneur\" either. I'm talking about someone who has closed deals, brought products to market, and made a company or two better than they ever were or ever have been.\n\n3. A tech that, if it doesn't bring something completely new and useful to the table (such as ETH smart contracts vs. Bitcoin's value transfer way back when, or IOTA with DAG vs. all blockchain coins recently), completely blows its competition out of the water. For example, RaiBlocks is the hot new value-transfer crypto (competition to Bitcoin, many others) that completely puts blockchain-based techs to shame due to its use of DAG. With almost-free transactions, instant transactions, and potential quantum-attack immunity, there's no way to view it as a no-brainer right now. That's just an example of this criteria of mine.\n\n4. My final criteria is a history of stability, and current wide adoption of the tech--even if I think it may have flaws down the road. These are the \"safe bets\" such as LTC and XRP that you can generally assume will slowly rise in value, and not crash/be manipulated by pnd's any time soon.\n\n5. When I follow the above 4 criteria, this final point is the most important--I never panic when there is a dip. I know from my time trading that the great techs with great teams and great potential will always end up rising in value over the long-haul, and I don't need to worry about, \"Will it crash? Should I chase a shitcoin for short-term gains?\" (Which, I've learned, is the best way to lose a lot of money). \n\nEveryone has different strategies, and I firmly believe the only way to feel comfortable and not panic trade during dips and moons is to learn your own strategy the hard way, and learn from your losses. Good luck! ",

Very hard. The overwhelming amount of people who tries beating the market fails at it. The amount of patience, discipline and knowledge (including insider knowledge) is unbearable for most investors. One bad trade can fuck up months and months of successful trades.\n\nI made lots of money day trading and to be completely honest looking back I just think it was absolutely not worth my time and I think I was lucky as well.\n\n90% of the people I know who invest through researching and buying the \"technology\" are barely up in $ and way down in Bitcoins ffs.\n\nDon't try to outsmart the market, you're gonna lose.",

Binance landed in deep water with regulators in the US. Coinbase continued to underperform against expectations in the stock market. Most coins and tokens trended down.\n\nIt is interesting how Cardano has flowed through this mess appreciating rather than decreasing in value. This is probably due to two simple things. One, it\u2019s not Bitcoin, so it\u2019s not in the primary spotlight of negative news. Two, it\u2019s got perhaps the most momentum of third generation blockchains, and that makes it an easy hedge for those concerned with point one.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. ADA is probably overpriced right now, riding on a halo due to low interest capital, crypto hype, and the primary market option floundering. A re-pricing will probably occur, I would suggest alongside ETH, as both have surged far ahead of their internal market growth. By that, I mean ahead of the smart contracts or profitable tokens, or practical global deployments matching the scaling of the token price.\n\nThese are heady times. It is a perfect moment to keep your hat firmly attached, stick to your long term plans, and not get distracted.\n\n== Additional Note ==\n\nI\u2019m bullish about the long term, but I suspect we will have a jolt in the short term as peak crypto 2021 passes. It\u2019s important to remember than the last time that happened, Cardano went from $1.0085 on January 1st 2018 to $0.1508 on March 26th 2018. In the latter part of the year it was trading in the 2 to 4 cent level with spikes to around 8 cent until April 2020, when it started the current upward trend, significantly accelerating in 2021. I don\u2019t expect as dramatic a repricing this time because the fundamentals have improved. Nevertheless\u2026 one should reread the paragraph above if one finds oneself getting too excited.",

Too many early whales like Polychain dumping on every pump attempt and having too much funds tied to the Tezos Foundation which pays most of that out as overhead. This creates a lot of FUD within the community and makes it very difficult to get momentum and expand their userbase. You have a few zealots, but it's very difficult to get someone reasonable to sing praises and rep the brand just to let some early VC dump on them and for TF members to promote Bitcoin on Twitter (yes, this happened). \n\nThe value of a public blockchain is really community x tech. Doge is the extreme of community power (via memes) making tech not important. Tezos has the tech but structurally shits on the good will of its community. Cardano has a good mix of both, which is why it is successful even before the smart contract upgrade is deployed (private testnet already up for weeks, public testnet announced for end of the month, public testnet currently estimated to be July-August though I'd say September based on IOG's history).",

In my opinion, investing in altcoins isn't the safest way to gain money, despite the hype coins like Doge. As for me, I choose to invest in those currencies that have already earned a reputation for themselves - BTC, Litecoin, ethereum. It seems more reasonable to invest in them and then open a deposit account with https://haruinvest.com/ and get my interest. This step helped me preserve and increase my assets. The fact that I opened my annual deposit with Haru saved me from unwise decisions in July when etherium's value went down, and I was considering selling all my stash.",

            "text": "**Update 2:** THE NOVEMBER SEGWIT2X HARDFORK HAS NOW BEEN CANCELLED! :D\n\n**Update:** Thank you for your appreciation on this article. I decided to publish it on Medium. &nbsp;\n\n[You can find the article on this link.](https://medium.com/@ross.p/with-less-than-a-dozen-days-left-before-the-segwit2x-fork-i-thought-id-start-gathering-some-facts-6386fe28d84f)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n**Existing Article:**\n\nWith less than a dozen days left before the SegWit2X fork, I thought I'd start gathering some facts before I start forming personal opinions and speculative conclusions. I refer to the SegWit1X chain as 1X and the SegWit2X chain as 2X for simplicity, and I have looked for very simple facts and safe assumptions. Here are the dots that I gathered: &nbsp; \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Fork at Block **494,784**. Approximate time = **16th of November** - see Reference 6 for exact time. &nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 **The New York Agreement:** The NYA involved parties representing about 83% of the then hashing power who all agreed to both hardforks - one for SegWit and another for an increased block size of 2MB (2X) within 6 months of the former. Further details in reference 1. &nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 It is safe to assume that miners will only mine the most profitable chain (possibly several chains in differing proportions). &nbsp;\n\n\u2022 If whales pump a single chain it will gain more value. If this happens, miners will be more inclined to mine that particular chain only. This will result in the other chain(s)potentially losing overall mining attractiveness. &nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 **1X** will continue to have a 1MB block and SegWit; &nbsp;\n\n\u2022 **2X** will have a 2MB block and SegWit; &nbsp;\n\n\u2022 **Bitcoin Cash** (Just for info right now) currently has an 8 MB block with NO SegWit; &nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 **Current Price Status (Futures) on BitFinex:** 2X/BTC = 0.17; 1X/BTC = 0.83 &nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 **Current Mining Status:** 2X = Around 85% of blocks are signalling for 2X. &nbsp;\n\nIt seems only a few mining pools including Slush Pool, F2Pool and Kano CKPool are not signalling Segwit2X. All Antpool (Jihan Wu) owned pools are signalling for Segwit2X and will likely continue to do so up to the fork. It is not clear if any other pools from the Segwit2X signalling group will change their minds in the meantime. &nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 **Lower mining power chain:** Likely to be 1X. Fees likely to be extremely high as not many miners. Difficulty adjustment could take a few weeks, if not months. Until then it will be very difficult to transfer funds.

Charles who has incorporated some of Vinny Lingham's quotes, states the following: &nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\t\n**a.** BCH is a fork of BTC with same PoW, but with improved Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA). BCH cannot die, but 1X and 2X could both die. If whales shift most of their holdings to BCH (or another coin), that would incentivise the miners to mine BCH (or another coin) instead of 1X and 2X. Both 1X and 2X would lose their mining power; however Core would release an emergency update to software adding DAA like BCH (or another coin). Thus, 1X would survive, and 2X (which might not get DAA) would die. &nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n**b.** If 2X continues to be the dominantly mined chain, 1X will be forced to launch an emergency update to their PoW with DAA. There could be fighting between the two chains, and as a result a struggle to become dominant --> potentially causing altcoins to flourish. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**My observations**\n\n\u2022 **BCH** is upgrading their EDA (Emergency Difficulty Adjuster) on Nov 13. [See website](https://www.bitcoincash.org). This will lead to reduced volatility in BCH - likely making it more attractive to more long-term miners. &nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\t\n\u2022 **Mining profitability:** It is currently almost equally profitable to mine either BTC or BCH. &nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022  What to keep and eye on before the fork to judge yourself where the fate of BTC is heading. &nbsp;\n\n1. **Mining** signalling distribution\n\n\n2. **DAA**: 1X or 2X software updates to implement Difficulty Adjustment Algorithms\n\n\n3. **Futures** price before fork\n\n\n4.

            "text": "This post goes to all of you who\u2019ve been around for about a month, weeks, days or even hours.\n\nOk, so after reading and hearing about this digital money thingy that magically grows on its own making everyone rich overnight called Bitcoin and confirming you don\u2019t have to buy a full coin for like $16,000, you\u2019ve decided you want in. You setup your Coinbase account, gave almost all your personal and banking info, plus a photo, your ID and  your credit card to a complete stranger and bought a fraction of something you barely understand hoping it will somehow turn your hard earned money into a fortune someday. But it looks like you\u2019re going nowhere, because as incredibly fast as BTC grows, right now it would need to go from around $16,000 to $32,000 just to turn your $300 investment into $600 and that\u2019s far from the huge profits you thought you\u2019d be making in a few months.\n\nSo... you read there\u2019s this other thing called Alternative Crypto Coins or Altcoins for short, and people say many of them are incredibly undervalued, meaning that they haven\u2019t been pumped in price yet so these Altcoins are the key to making it big for small investors like yourself. What happens when you decide you want to invest in Altcoins? Well, the main problem is that there\u2019re more than 900 different projects out there and at least 100 of them can be considered somewhat \u201cserious\u201d. Then, how to decide which ones are worth your money?? Well, the main advice people gave newbies mere months ago was to read a lot, understand each project, visit forums, read whitepapers, check market caps, coins in circulation,join communities and decide for yourself.\n\nAnd you may think: \u201cI came here for the easy magic internet money and now I have to spend weeks reading things I don\u2019t understand to decide if I should invest on a project that may or may not explode in price months or maybe even years from now?? No thanks. There has to be an easier way\u201d.\n\nAnd you decide it\u2019s best to just check a few subreddits like this one and see what people are talking about. Ignoring all previous posts making exactly the same question you start a new thread asking everyone where you should put your money. And I don\u2019t blame you. I\u2019ve been there too. I know what it feels like to have your money ready to invest in anything and you just need someone to point you in the right direction, no matter which one, but fast because people are making money out of this and you don\u2019t want to be left behind. So let me be the first one to say: OK. Go ahead and trust your money to a complete stranger on the Internet who\u2019s telling you to buy as much as you can of this coin you\u2019ve never heard of, but it\u2019s going to the moon in a matter of days. It\u2019s ok. You have to learn how this market works one way or another. Maybe after making your first few investments you can take it more slowly and start actually reading about this amazing new technological environment that\u2019s the blockchain. Maybe after that you can make better personal decisions and even put your money behind a project you really find interesting and worth it.\n\nI\u2019m just going to give you one little piece of advice. When you\u2019re reading posts and this guy comes and says \u201cYou should be all buying this coin because it\u2019s got a great team behind, a serious project a real world application...\u201d and all that, please, take your time to, at least, check that user\u2019s history and profile. It will only take something from minutes to like an hour max and you\u2019ll find out how long they\u2019ve been redditors for, what other people think about them and their comments and posts, if they normally give good advice, if they\u2019ve been right before about other coins, if they\u2019re normally upvoted and therefore have a high karma... After all it\u2019s your money and you shouldn\u2019t just give it away without having at least a basic idea about where it\u2019s going or if you\u2019re just being used by some guy who just wants to dump his bags of shitcoins on gullible newbies.\n\nHappy Hodling!!",

Note: These are not weighted averages but I doubt that makes any difference.\n\n[Top 100 CMC coins by price](https://i.imgur.com/rjW9rTl.png)  \nHere we're sorting by price-per-coin from the most expensive coins (BTC, BCH, DASH, ETH) to the least expensive (KIN, XP, BCN, DOGE). There's a pretty clear trend here that the expensive coins are up a little bit, but the cheaper the coin is the more likely it is to be up a huge amount.\n\n[Top 100 CMC coins by circulating supply](https://i.imgur.com/aha3LX3.png)  \nThis is sorted by the total number of coins in circulating supply, from fewest (GBYTE, GNO, BTCD, DGD) to the most (KIN, XP, BCN, DOGE). There's an even clearer trend here that the coins with smaller total supplies are up a little bit, but the more coins circulating the more likely that coin is to be up by a lot.\n\n[Top 100 CMC coins by market cap](https://i.imgur.com/PXMjTeM.png)  \nThis is the top 100 coins by the value of their total market capitalization from lowest (WTC, POE, BLOCK, ITC) to highest (BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH). This time there's basically no trend. The coins with the highest market caps are up just about as much as the lowest market cap coins, and it's fairly random inbetween.\n\nI'm neither a statistician nor a market analyst but this looks like pure market irrationality to me. The best recent predictor here for market performance of a coin is simply the size of its circulating supply, which is essentially a meaningless decision about where to put a decimal place. Satoshi could have just as easily capped bitcoin at 21 billion coins instead of 21 million, and maybe if he did the BTC market cap would be much higher because people would perceive it as \"seeming cheap\".\n\nWe're in a bull market and nearly everything has been up, so there's a lot of FOMO and throwing money at anything that moves. If this was the stock market I would knowingly tap the side of my monocle and say \"Oh ho, fundamental valuations will catch up to you in the end, and then you'll be sorry you didn't do your due dilligence.\" In crypto, however, I've seen little evidence so far that fundamental valuation ever catches up to anybody.\n",

The fact that share price has literally nothing to do with the valuation of a company if you don't consider the amount of shares circulating... it's such a basic knowledge... (except you can't buy less than 1 share as an individual, making higher price shares slightly \"out of reach\" for small investors, like e.g. Amazon, but still...)\n\nAnd more than that, the constant confusing between cryptocurrencies and stocks is just nonsensical. If cryptos were to be comparable to other assets, at least use commodities... or better yet, treat cryptos like what they purpose to be, i.e. ***currencies***, like $ or Euro, i.e. not \"shares\" of anything but means of exchange of actual value (e.g. human work for pizza via the medium called \"dollar\").\n\nThey're not equivalent to currencies, I think it's a category of their own, but still. It would be the least bad comparison to make. It would actually make sense at least intellectually (logic & semantics), if not financially/economically.\n\nIt's all boding so bad for the short/medium term of this market.\n\nEventually, I have no doubt the crypto-techs ('s' because not final yet insofar as it's all still beta software) will become a thing in our world. Perhaps not instead of fiat currencies but at least concurrently with those.\n\nBut in the meantime, this crazy market will crash. And then it will get worse before it gets better. Eventually we'll see some sanity, but I'm thinking years (mid-2020's). ",

            "text": "I am putting together my investment portfolio for 2018 and made a complete summary of the current Top 100. Interestingly, I noticed that all coins can be categorized into 12 markets. Which markets do you think will play the biggest role in the coming year?\n\nHere is a complete overview of all coins in an excel sheet including name, a full description, market, TPS, risk profile, time since launch (negative numbers mean that they are launching that many months in the future) and market cap. You can also sort by all of these fields of course. Coins written in bold are the strongest contenders within their market either due to having the best technology or having a small market cap and still excellent technology and potential. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s8PHcNvvjuy848q18py_CGcu8elRGQAUIf86EYh4QZo/edit#gid=0\n\nThe 12 markets are\n\n1. Currency 13 coins\n2. Platform 25 coins\n3. Ecosystem 7 coins\n4. Privacy 11 coins\n6. Currency Exchange Tool 8 coins \n7. Gaming & Gambling  5 coins\n5. Misc 15 coins\n8. Social Network  4 coins\n9. Fee Token 3 coins\n10. Decentralized Data Storage 4 coins\n11. Cloud Computing 3 coins\n12. Stable Coin 2 coins\n\n####**Foreword**\nBefore we look at the individual markets, we need to take a look of the overall market and its biggest issue, scalability, first:\n \nCryptocurrencies aim to be a decentralized currency that can be used worldwide. Their goal is to replace dollar, Euro, Yen, all FIAT currencies globally. The coin that will achieve that will be worth several trillion dollars. \n\nBitcoin can only process 7 transactions per second (TPS) currently. In order to replace all FIAT, it would need to perform at least at VISA levels, which usually processes around 3,000 TPS, up to 25,000 TPS during peak times and a maximum of 64,000 TPS.  That means that this cryptocurrency would need to be able to perform at least several thousand TPS. However, a ground breaking technology should not look at current technology to set a goal for its use, i.e. estimating the number of emails sent in 1990 based on the number of faxes sent wasn\u2019t a good estimate.\n\nFor that reason, 10,000 TPS is the absolute baseline for a cryptocurrency that wants to replace FIAT. This brings me to IOTA, which wants to connect all 80 billion IoT devices that are expected to exist by 2025, which constantly communicate with each other, possibly creating 80 billion or more transactions per second. This is the benchmark that cryptocurrencies should be aiming for. Currently, 8 billion devices are connected to the Internet.\n\nWith its Lightning network recently launched, Bitcoin is realistically looking at 50,000 possible TPS soon. Other notable cryptocurrencies besides IOTA and Bitcoin are Nano with 7,000 TPS already tested, Dash with several billion TPS possible with Masternodes, Neo, LISK and RHOC with 100,000 TPS by 2020, Ripple with 50,000 TPS, Ethereum with 10,000 TPS with Sharding. \n\nHowever, it needs to be said that scalability usually goes at the cost of decentralization and security. So, it needs to be seen, which of these technologies can prove themselves decentralized while maintaining high TPS.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the coins of the first market. Each market is sorted by market cap.\n\n##Market 1 - Currency:\n\n1. Bitcoin\n2. Ripple\n3. Bitcoin Cash\n4. Litecoin \n5. IOTA\n6. Dash\n6. Nano\n9. Decred\n14. Bitcoin Atom\n15. Dogecoin\n16. Bitcoin Gold\n17. Digibyte\n19. Bitcoin Diamond \n\n##Market 2 - Platform\nMost of the cryptos here have smart contracts and allow dapps (Decentralized apps) to be build on their platform and to use their token as an exchange of value between dapp services.\n\n1. Ethereum\n2. EOS\n3. Cardano\n4. VeChain\n5. Neo\n6. Aeternity\n8. Stellar\n18. Ethereum classic\n11. Ziliqa\n6. QTUM \n7. Icon\n8. LISK\n9. Rchain \n10. ARDR\n11. Ark\n11. Ontology\n12. Bytom\n13. Nxt \n14. Stratis \n15. Status \n17. Neblio \n18. NEM\n19. Bancor\n20. Dragonchain\n7. Skycoin\n\n##Market 3 - Ecosystem\nThe 3rd market with 11 coins is comprised of ecosystem coins, which aim to strengthen the ease of use within the crypto space through decentralized exchanges, open standards for apps and more \n\n1. Nebulas\n2. Waves\n3. Salt\n4. CHAINLINK\n6. WTC\n7. Ethos \n9. Aion\n\n##Market 4 - Privacy\nThe 4th market are privacy coins. As you might know, Bitcoin is not anonymous. If the IRS or any other party asks an exchange who is the identity behind a specific Bitcoin address, they know who you are and can track back almost all of the Bitcoin transactions you have ever made and all your account balances. Privacy coins aim to prevent exactly that through address fungability, which changes addresses constantly, IP obfuscation and more. There are 2 types of privacy coins, one with completely privacy and one with optional privacy. Optional Privacy coins like Dash and Nav have the advantage of more user friendliness over completely privacy coins such as Monero and Enigma. However, the question is if full privacy coins will be hindered in growth through government regulations or not or if optional privacy coins will become more successful through ease of use and no regulatory hindrance. \n\n\n1. Monero\n3. Zcash\n4. Verge \n5. Bytecoin \n6. Bitcoin Private\n6. Komodo\n7. PIVX\n8. Zcoin\n9. Enigma\n10. Navcoin\n13. Tenx\n\n##Market 5 - Currency Exchange Tool\nDue to the sheer number of different cryptocurrencies, exchanging one currency for the other it still cumbersome. Further, merchants don\u2019t want to deal with overcluttered options of accepting cryptocurrencies. This is where exchange tool like Req come in, which allow easy and simple exchange of currencies. \n\n1. Cryptonex\n2. QASH\n3. Kyber\n4. Achain\n5. Req\n6. Bitshares.  \n5. Loopring\n8. ZRX\n\n##Market 6 - Gaming\nWith an industry size of $108B worldwide, Gaming is one of the largest markets in the world. For sure, cryptocurrencies will want to have a share of that pie.\n\n1. Storm\n2. Fun\n4. Electroneum\n5. Wax\n\n##Market 7 - Misc\nThere are various markets being tapped right now. They are all summed up under misc. \n\n1. OMG \n2. Power ledger\n3. Populous\n4. Monacoin\n5. Revain\n3. Augur\n6. Substratum\n7. Veritaseum \n8. TRON\n9. Syscoin\n10. Hshare\n11. BAT\n12. Dent\n13. Ncash\n14. Factom \n\n##Market 8 - Social network\nWeb 2.0 is still going strong and Web 3.0 is not going to ignore it. There are several gaming tokens already out there and a few with decent traction already, such as Steem, which is Reddit with voting through money is a very interesting one.\n\n1. Mithril\n2. Steem \n3. Rdd\n12. Kin\n\n##Market 9 - Fee token\nPopular exchanges realized that they can make a few billion dollars more by launching their own token. Owning these tokens gives you a reduction of trading fees. Very handy and BNB (Binance Coin) has been one of the most resilient tokens, which have withstood most market drops over the last weeks and was among the very few coins that could show growth.\n\n1. BNB\n2. Gas\n3. Kucoin\n\n##Market 10 - Decentralized Data Storage\nCurrently, data storage happens with large companies or data centers that are prone to failure or losing data. Decentralized data storage makes loss of data almost impossible by distributing your files to numerous clients that hold tiny pieces of your data. Remember Torrents? Torrents use a peer-to-peer network. It is similar to that. Many users maintain copies of the same file, when someone wants a copy of that file, they send a request to the peer-to-peer network., users who have the file, known as seeds, send fragments of the file to the requester., he requester receives many fragments from many different seeds, and the torrent software recompiles these fragments to form the original file.\n\n1. Gbyte\n2. Siacoin\n3. Maidsafecoin\n4. Storj\n\n##Market 11 - Cloud computing\nObviously, renting computing power, one of the biggest emerging markets as of recent years, e.g. AWS and Digital Ocean, is also a service, which can be bought and managed via the blockchain.\n\n1. Golem\n2. Elf\n\n##Market 12 - Stablecoin\nLast but not least, there are 3 stablecoins that have established themselves within the market. A stable coin is a coin that wants to be independent of the volatility of the crypto markets. This has worked out pretty well for Maker and DGD, accomplished through a carefully diversified currency fund and backing of each token with 1g of real gold respectively. DO NOT CONFUSE DGD AND MAKER with their STABLE COINS DGX and DAI. DGD and MAKER are volatile, because they are the companies of DGX and DAI. DGX and DAI are the stable coins.\n\n1. DGD\n2. Maker\n10. USDT\n\n_________________________________________\nEDIT: Added a risk factor from 0 to 10. The baseline is 2 for any crypto. Significant scandals, mishaps, shady practices, questionable technology, increase the risk factor. Not having a product yet automatically means a risk factor of 6. Strong adoption and thus strong scrutiny or positive community lower the risk factor.\n\nEDIT2: Added a subjective potential factor from 0 to 10, where its overall potential and a small or big market cap is factored in. Bitcoin with lots of potential only gets a 9, because of its massive market cap, because if Bitcoin goes 10x, smaller coins go 100x, PIVX gets a 10 for being as good as Monero while carrying a 10x smaller market cap, which would make PIVX go 100x if Monero goes 10x.\n\nIf you liked this post, follow me on my profile for upcoming analysis posts https://www.reddit.com/u/galan77",

Left to continue my MBA program, and I am still an active Komodo supporter, obviously.)\n\n\nSome information about Komodo, to try to help clear up the constant misconception that we're a privacy coin.\n\n\nKomodo is a platform. In philosophical decision making, we're try to adhere to the same principles that make Linux and its many distros useful.\n\n\nOur primary focuses are:\n\n\n  * Our security measures\n    *  We endow all developers' blockchains on our platform with the Bitcoin hash rate. It is as though the Bitcoin hash rate is an upstream \"kernel\" that we pull into our collective platform features\n  * Atomic-swap capabilities \n    * This is what enables people to create independent cryptocurrencies on Komodo and sell their creations without having to wait for a centralized exchange to approve their product, and for their users to trade freely between coins\n    * Our atomic-swap tech is complete and arguably the most advanced/tested. We've been testing atomic swaps since 2014, and currently have completed ~100,000 swaps\n  * Our language-agnostic, multi-blockchain compatible, smart-contract API\n    * We created a solution called Merkle Root of Merkle Root, or MoM for short, that allows for multi-chain smart-contracts.\n    * In other words, on Komodo, you can run a smart-contract between, for instance, Komodo, Bitcoin, and Ripple, and when the smart-contract updates on one blockchain network, the MoM tech detects the advance in the smart contract and pushes the updated data to the other blockchains.\n\n\nWe provide the option of zero-knowledge privacy as a part of all this, by using the Zcash parameters as an upstream update, but this is just an aside. Most transactions on the Komodo platform are transparent (i.e. non-zk-private).\n\n\nHope that's helpful.\n\n\nedit: I'm not sure there's a difference between platform and ecosystem. It depends on how you look at it. For Komodo, we're a platform, and the collective of users, activity, and users' products becomes an ecosystem. ",

Look at volume of Visa, mastercard etc. We need decentralized, fast (ideally instant), cheap(ideally free) coin, that shouldn't kill our planet when being operational. Why does the fridge need to communicate with anything every second anyway? Plus for me adopting as a global currency any coin which is controlled by one entity is straight up stupid.

After its initial boom, markets consolidate and only the strongest survive. \n\n> Plus for me adopting as a global currency any coin which is controlled by one entity is straight up stupid. Do you really want to give THAT much power to a private company?\n\nCurrently almost all currencies are owned by only a handful of entities, which changes after further adoption. www.arewedecentralizedyet.com\n\nI'm not saying that Nano is bad, but scalability is probably the biggest hurdle for cryptocurrencies right now and the coin which can handle\nbillions of tps simply has a better hand than one that can only do 50,000. It's too early to tell in what way scalability is an issue, but it definitely shouldn't be underestimated. ",

Idk if its Greed or Fear of Missing out on Potential Profits. What strategies do you guys use to take profits? Anyone here takes a small percentage weekly or monthly? When you sell stuff, do you keep a small percentage like 10-15% just in case the coin pumps later? A lot of times I sell something that hasn\u2019t been moving for months and then it conveniently pumps after I sell it as if they were all waiting for me to leave haha. \n\nI watched my portfolio go from $200 in Early December 2020 to around $43,000 during the first week of May 2021 (Thanks to all the Meme Tokens). Then it dropped a lot, but now its recovering. I still have PTSD from the January 2018 crash, but what I learned from that is that HODLing through that crash would have made me back everything that I had if I had faith and patience. I watched the same thing happen again last month. My guts and instincts were telling me to Buy stuff when they\u2019re red even when they\u2019re dipping daily. It was hard tbh. \n\nI remember everyone wishing for low prices and saying \u201cIf xxx goes back to $$$, i\u2019m buying a lot\u201d and \u201cIf I bought xxx last month or last year at those prices, I would have been rich\u201d. Everyone says things like that and how if they bought Bitcoin or any other coin, they would be millionaires, but the reality is that if they bought any coin early, they\u2019d sell it early or panic sell it at a Loss after any of the annual/yearly FUDs that come and go. \n\nI don\u2019t trade on emotions and I am unfazed/desensitized to FUD. I can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s part of the issue since I suck at taking profits. Yes, I know that historically things tend to go up if you zoom out, but I lost around a million dollar\u2019s worth of profits between this bull run and the last one mainly because of my HODLer mentality. I tried switching back and forth between being a Trader and Holder, but I just couldn\u2019t convince myself to do it. How do you guys do it? Any tips or suggestions or advice? And for profits, what kinda strategies do you guys use for taking them? (A percentage of the profits? Taking only your initial investment?). Don\u2019t tell me that we Never Take Profits here. \n\nHolding is easy, Taking Profits is Hard. Looking for Genuine advice.",

I have coded the risk metrics into tradingview. These models give very similar results to another popular crypto risk metric which costs $95/mo.  The models were created in matlab using econometrics and machine learning toolboxes.   I have coded these models in order to predict market cycle peaks and bottoms. I decided to make this, because if you are younger or in college, new investor or whoever you may be.... you may not have $1200 sitting around to buy access to the more well known model.  I believe you however, still deserve to have access to a model which can accurately help you determine where market cycle tops and bottoms may occur, even if you are not rich (yet). **In fact if you are a young investor, the opportunity cost and eventual lost profit from spending $1200/yr** is massive when compounded over time. It is kind of backwards that only the wealthy investor should have access to information which makes them more wealthy.\n\nThe risk analysis model is so far coded for Bitcoin, Cardano, Etherum, and Solana. I am currently working on developing the model for other top alt coins.\n\nEDIT: The model is currently invite only on tradingview. You will need to head to the youtube video to watch how to use a model like this, and then signup following the link there (google forms signup - no spam mail will be sent to you, only your tradingview username is required). [https://youtu.be/OYeBdFx2sEc](https://youtu.be/OYeBdFx2sEc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This is the Ethereum risk model coded into Tradingview - these are available now](https://preview.redd.it/uqmbdw0z2kv71.png?width=1798&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e550f95930dfac76c0dc28b215fd83b50b62f5b)\n\nThe tradingview indicator is now available to access. I also explain in detail how to use this model on my youtube channel. My channel is completely focused on data analysis of the crypto markets. I am working on making tools that crypto investors can use for free to develop a better investment strategy.  Here is a link to the video describing how to use this model, instructions on how to signup for the model can be found here also: [https://youtu.be/OYeBdFx2sEc](https://youtu.be/OYeBdFx2sEc)",

Over 90% of my portfolio locked up in our flagship coin.\n\nI\u2019m spooked though, anything can happen with the fork, Tether is looking suspect and BitConnect is a clear Ponzi scheme. It feels like a house of cards ready to crash at any point.\n\nI\u2019m a trader, I\u2019m not a gambler. Right now it is too hard to trade, nobody knows what the fuck will happen, anything can.\n\nI\u2019ve sold the lot. My view is this, if the price crashes I don\u2019t lose anything. If the price rallies I don\u2019t lose anything. There are always new trades to make and I\u2019ll be looking once the fork settles and we know where we are.\n\nIt\u2019s been a great year but I am now stress free. I\u2019m not checking prices every 5 minutes and I can go to sleep without the fear of checking prices in the morning.\n\nI hope Bitcoin goes from strength to strength and I hope any traders holding through the fork make good money, I hope Segwit2x burns to the ground.\n\nGood luck all, long live Bitcoin x",

And the 12% apr that they pay me every week is really adding up. Now I\u2019m sitting at 99% CRO and am still buying more every week. And they\u2019ve made so much progress since July. \n\n- Fortune favors the brave campaign with Matt Damon + many ads in top cities all over the world\n- Acquisition of name rights of the crypto.com arena\n- DeFi and cronos network launching, which I think is equally big in driving this bill run as the ad campaign\n- their exchange set to launch this or next month, which is going to be huge if done right \n\nIt\u2019s hard to recommend a better project out their right now. Im sure CDC\u2019s market cap will rise to binance current market cap in a few years, if not sooner (by then binance will probably grow too, not saying I think CDC will overtake binance anytime soon)",

Decentralization and control of the financial system have also been major topics. As for national security concerns, many countries will probably have to reconsider their positions on Bitcoin acceptance and deployment.  \n\n\nUkraine has received bitcoin contributions, while Russian oligarchs have transferred their wealth into cryptocurrency in order to avoid their assets being frozen or confiscated.  \n\n\nCrypto exchanges operate as banks for digital assets. They are broadly divided into two categories: CEX and DEX. In many ways, centralized exchanges are similar to traditional banks. Also, these platforms have rules and regulations and are generally regarded as easy-to-use and trustworthy. The KYC process is usually required.   \n\n\nI became fully aware of DEX since I began using my first DeFi platform, KAIBA, not long ago, and I also understand that DEX eliminates the intermediary altogether and functions as peer-to-peer marketplaces where smart contracts and atomic swaps are used to conduct transactions. Traders are responsible for their own money and are liable if it is misplaced, for example, when their private keys are hacked or payments are delivered to the wrong location.   \n\n\nNow consider all of this in the context of the war. Shutting down the accounts and actions of users in the decentralized system appears to be a near-impossible process. Federov noted this and stated that the \u201cUkrainian crypto community is ready to provide a generous reward for any information about crypto-wallets of Russian and Belarusian politicians and their surroundings\u201d. Seems like a witch-hunt has begun.",

I am hoping one of you have some logical reason and insight that might rebalance my expectations about ETH and bring my frame of thinking back down to earth, or if not solidify my current state of mind that ETH is the future of crypto currency and offers more value to the world than BTC or other alt coins. \n\nSuperiority over alt coins:\n\n1. ETH being one of the top crypto currencies in the world makes it an easy choice when considering any digital asset; it has proven its legitimacy and built a thick layer of confidence over the years that will be hard to break in to the future.\n\n2. Smart contracts look to change the landscape of financial markets, or really any area today where money or consensus is exchanged between two parties regardless of application. This one is huge I cannot stress enough how valuable smart contracts are to the future of the world.\n\n3. Though other coins have hit the stage offering smart contract functionality, and even offering higher throughput when compared to ETH, the prospect of consensus layer (ETH 2.0) which claims to offer 100,000 transaction per second (Google suggest that Visa can handle 24,000 transaction per second?). This enormous increase in transaction processing would put ETH in the number 1 seat for throughput and scalability. Unlocking the endless potential for smart contracts and transactions in general.\n\n4. Reliability is a big factor for me, despite some of these really interesting new coins that offer a comparable network all seems to have a struggle adjusting to their popularity and in a pretty bad way. ETH though not susceptible to similar experiences has already had its share of discovery and has perhaps matured to a more reliable and dependable network.\n\n5. The ETH development team is perhaps one of the most respected and trusted block chain development teams in the world. Over the years this team has garnered a huge amount of respect in the crypto community. This makes me feel that I am in pretty good hands and that is worth something.\n\nSuperiority over BTC: \n\nDespite BTC being the big dog on the block and accepted by most as the gold standard of crypto, I see many reasons why ETH is a far better option.\n\n6. True Value - BTC fights a lot of battles in regards to its true value, many will argue that BTC has no real value and offers nothing but a collective agreement that it is valuable (I don\u2019t agree with this btw), you know like gold or diamonds, things we have all agreed are valuable.... However stupid this argument is there is some truth in the logic, as gold can still be used in maybe industrial applications resulting in value outside of just backing a currency (which it doesn\u2019t even do anymore in some cases). This argument against BTC true value cannot be applied to ETH as in addition to being an asset it also offers utility, if we all agree ETH was useless as an asset what we could not deny is the its usefulness as a utility due to smart contract functionality.\n\n7. We know who created ETH. Early on and perhaps still today people find comfort in the fact that BTCs creator is anonymous (or dead, or maybe not anonymous? who knows?) this seemed pretty cool in 2017 when the world started to find real interest in block chain and decentralization. However I feel as time has passed this has become a hindrance for BTC, if the last couple years have taught us anything it\u2019s that crypto currency needs flexibility to become truly useful and to be applied in any mainstream setting. It is my personal opinion that knowing a dedicated development team backs a product and is pushing to improve it leave me with this a sense that BTC will become the Commodore 64 of the crypto world in the next 10 years with no true direction or guidance. ETH will become the Xbox, or PlayStation.\n\n8. Out of reach, growth potential - Many claim BTC is going to between $100,000 and $500,000 in the next X number of years; though this may be true normal people cannot acquire enough BTC to allow them to buy that Lambo. ETH however is still only 3k at time of writing this, which gives us little guys a fighting chance of getting in early (or sooner). Imagine ETH is realized to its full potential with Defi, NFTs, governance, or any other future application and it can also transact 100k transactions per second. What\u2019s not to say ETH will be worth 40,000 or even 100,000 in future? In this regard ETH could much more easily double, triple, quadruple, rinse and repeat. currently the total supply is of ETH is in the 120 million range and BTC is 21 million, today if you reduced the supply of ETH to match that of BTC each ETH would be 15k, still far below the value of where BTC sits, this is insane, how ETH is currently 3 times less valuable than BTC while offering so much more?!\n\nAs a software engineer with a solid understanding of crypto, block chain, and smart contracts it feels impossible for me to accept that ETHs true value has been recognized and I know that its full potential far exceeds that\u2019s of BTC or any crypto currency to date. I know with depth how a lot of applications work, I think this makes it a bit easier for me to see how ETH could be used is an endless amount of ways to benefit nearly all industries. My go to example is my interpretation of DeFi as a trustless financial Internet thinks of the opportunities this presents to developers, businesses, entrepreneurs, or any of us as individuals. Block chain will allow the collective voice of the world to be heard without a filter and transact with freedom so we can create the world we truly desire.\n\nIf you made it this far I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts as to why any logic I have outlined above is either flat out wrong, misunderstood, or irrelevant to the success of ETH.",

This is approximately twice as much as the second and third place finishers, BNB Chain and Fantom.\n\n Ethereum, still controls 54 percent of the DeFi market, worth $111 billion. According to CoinGecko, LUNA has increased by roughly 38.8% in the last week. Over the same time frame, Anchor Protocol (ANC), Terra's largest DeFi project's native token, rose by more than 70%. Anchor is a money market similar to Ethereum's , where users may earn up to 19.49% on Terra UST.\n\nAs a result, there's a lot of price activity boosting the Terra ecology. The causes for the recent increase are several. Last month, for example, the LUNA token debuted on the FTX Exchange.\n\nThe protocol is making $1 billion for a Bitcoin treasury, obtained through a LUNA token sale, was more significant. The funds will reportedly be used to establish a \"UST Forex Reserve,\" according to Jump Crypto and Three Arrows Capital, who led the raise on February 23.\n\n I really am bullish in DeFi, that\u2019s why my main investments are in DeFi, making sure I diversify across multiple networks, like Terra on cosmos, AGFI on ethereum, CAKE on the bnb chain and so on. I think this cannot stop from growing rapidly until one outperforms all the others. What is your opinion on this aspect of defi, will there be one winner or will they all win?",

Or perhaps someone here would be so kind as to try to explain it to me? I'm specially interested in learning how these two technologies will complement or compete with one another.  \n\nAccording to the information on the Hedera website, there will be some amount of interaction between the two networks. Is that correct? Or will it devolve into a battle for market share, with one technology eventually edging out the other owing to adoption rates?  \n\nI've only recently caught back up with Hedera after very recent headlines regarding the HBAR Foundation and the $100M impact fund which was launched for innovators to build a vast network of Dapps and protocols only on Hedera.  \n\nLet's see how Ethereum moving to PoS will turn out, hopefully Ethereum will be able to handle the mainstream audience.\n\nAny ideas or references would be really helpful.",

            "text": "As **Ethereum** continues to gain more popularity, the need to scale up to handle more transactions give birth to several Ethereum scaling solutions including Layer 2 roll-ups & Side-chains. All scaling solutions are created to meet up the goals of transaction speed and transaction throughput, allowing the platform to process thousands of transactions per second and scale globally.\n\nHowever, Layer 2 platforms use the Ethereum main-net security directly from the Layer 1 *Ethereum* consensus unlike the Sidechains that run parallel to the Ethereum main-net. The Layer 2 platforms like *Optimism, ZK roll-ups, Arbitrum, Nahmii,* etc, provide solutions with Ethereum scaling issues and development of more L2's to ensure Ethereum continues to be the most continually used smart contract platform as more organizations/institutions begin to understand the benefits and abilities smart contracts. \n\n*Optimism* is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible but takes a longer time for transactions to be confirmed unlike ZK roll-ups that are not EVM compatible but faster transaction throughput. For the Optimistic security protocols to be enacted on *Arbitrum*, 7-days wait time for main-net confirmation is needed. Thereafter, i found *Nahmii* to be the most prominent model employed to scale *Ethereum.* \n\n**Nahmii** is a revolutionary layer 2 scaling protocol for the Ethereum blockchain which provides faster throughput, low latency, instant finality and predictable fees that are unmatched by other scaling solutions. Nahmii is EVM compatible and addresses challenges by leveraging Ethereum's security providing a high-speed and low-cost execution layer. It makes every Ethereum dApp better and production-ready with:\n\n* **High Throughput**\n* **Low Latency**\n* **Instant Finality**\n* **Predictable Fees**\n* **Low Transaction Fees** \n\n**Nahmii** bridge is one of the exciting features within the Nahmii ecosystem, making it stand out from the competition. The Nahmii Bridge works through the meta-mask extension and serves as a portal in and out of the Nahmii network. It also allows deposit and withdrawal of ERC-20 tokens like **NII.**\n\nOnce a bridge of assets from Ethereum to Nahmii is complete, the asset balance is displayed within a short time.  These amazing features generally make Nahmii one of the fastest-growing Scaling solutions on the Ethereum network.\n\n**Learn more about the Nahmii bridge here:** \n\n[***https://blog.nahmii.io/the-nahmii-bridge-is-now-live-e245bcfe6d66***](https://blog.nahmii.io/the-nahmii-bridge-is-now-live-e245bcfe6d66)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts about other Ethereum scaling solutions including layer 2 platforms and side-chains.",

I think that it was kind of expected to see Eth doing good, even though it wasn\u2019t the only altcoin, Solana was also one of these that were living good times before that bear market hits. \n\nBut I\u2019m trying to be more realistic. What do you think is the case with Ethereum right now? Even Vitalik Buterin has admitted that Ethereum 2.0 might be taking around 6 years to arrive, which means that as things stand, we will be living with the same gas fees and the same congestions on the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nI\u2019m not a fan of comparisons, I mean each cryptocurrency project serves its community in its own way. But if you look at it, now we do have some blockchains that are giving too much competition to Eth. I mean look at the improvements Solana is doing on a daily basis, and it even became the home for most gaming and NFT startups now. Even one of the most promising launchpads, solanaprime, is going to be boosting startups to this chain offering insurance funds to protect the investors from scams. This might be one of the best opportunities to invest in startups.\n\nI mean this is real competition. I\u2019m not saying this or that chains are going to be the \u201cEthereum killers\u201d, definitely not, Eth is always going to be Eth, but the competition is hot now, and it\u2019s only for our good as investors. \n\nBut what do you think is the matter with Ethereum now? What\u2019s next? I understand that this is a bear market, but were you expecting Bitcoin to outperform it in terms of price?",

Perhaps there are many of them on the BSC or Sol network? Perhaps similar projects also appear on other blockchains, which allow transactions to be carried out instantly without huge commissions.

And as a result, provide users with personal data management and equitable healthcare. \n\nOn another exciting news, Polygon DAO launched Polygon village which is going to be a full stack ecosystem to help devs build and grow by giving access to all services and offerings ranging from hosting, audit service, infrastructure, api related services, and most important talent discovery. This will motivate more and more devs to migrate to Polygon network.\n\nToday Matic price is around 1.45$ trading at 50% below its ATH. If you check all price prediction platforms, headlines are positive. You can also do your own analysis and still discover that an increase in price will soon take place. Anyways, I want to be clear, this is not a financial advice. I\u2019m just giving a handful of fundamental reasons to remain optimistic on Polygon.",

This helps maintain a healthy and stable token price that benefits traders, investors, and liquidity providers.\r  \n\r  \nGemkeeper is a community-focused Automated Market Maker (AMM) and DeFi platform built on Oasis\u2019 Emerald Paratime. It allows users to execute token swaps, enter existing and create new liquidity pools.

They also range from companies that work in all possible areas from medical, automotive, DeFi, NFT, trading, staking, etc. This is to say that for an ecosystem like Oasis there are a lot of partners that focus on different aspects. And that is because a network like Oasis has so broad use cases and interests. \n\nIt would be useful to look at our roadmap to find our current interests, but let me just quickly mention a couple of things that we are currently working on. NFT and GameFi economies are very interesting to us, and we are working on integrating the building blocks and primitives that allow us to bootstrap those into our network. One company from our Metaminds x Accelerator program (another partner :D ), Rosart, already released their NFT Launchpad, and are launching their marketplace. Rosart is also becoming a partner to our other programs so that they can support other projects in our ecosystem, like the foundation has supported them. This way we facilitate success in all ways and cross generationally. \n\nAnother focuses of ours are DeFi and Confidentiality. Those are whole different stories, but with very similar dynamics as with Rosart. Ultimately, building success for a L1 revolves around partnerships as long term win-win situations are what it takes to be successful in this space.",

We are highly underrated when it comes to our global presence and we are looking to change this in the upcoming quarters in a dramatic way.\r  \n\r  \nOur approach is that we attract high-quality Ambassadors from online communities just like this one.

As we speak there are a lot of teams deploying their applications to the Network via the acceleration and hackathon programs. Aside of the ones being developed its already possible to use some of the many DEXes and lending protocols, and to collect some amazing NFT sets \ud83e\udd73\r  \nOur current hackathon, The Oasis Bloom Hackathon, will raise brand awareness of Oasis within the developer community and yield some great dApps for our ecosystem.

Gaming on ETH, for example,  is not sustainable as gas fees can go through the roof when there is high traffic. It would be devastating for gamers to part with upwards of 50$ every time they need to complete a transaction. P2E games require many txs for players to progress and low gas costs are essential to success. Oasis Network is perfectly positioned to attract high-quality gaming projects where blockchain is not just \u201cone element\u201d  with ongoing hackathons, a booming ecosystem fund, and a fast-growing community.",

Thanks for asking it :)  \n\n\nThe mainstream has a lot of use cases that can benefit from transposing existing web2 and offline process to a smart contract / decentralized system. Most of these currently, however, suffer from the public nature of all data stored on chain. If you just imagine, how many things would you store online if all of the information was publicly available. Things like all of your emails, your bank account transactions and location data can be stored on the blockchain but currently only in a public format where everyone has access to the same data.  \n\n\nNow this is obviously a sub optimal method of doing things, and this is what Oasis is here to solve. Our technology allows us to store all this information using blockchain but to keep it private simultaneously. That is what we believe will be the catalyst for mainstream adaptation. Timing wise we are actually really close now for that to happen, so I\u2019m expecting first mainstream applications using confidential data to roll out in 2022. And that\u2019s super exciting!",

It\u2019s also not technically following the rules, but after a long time of manual grinding I also discovered the ability to run multiple bots simultaneously which increased the efficiency of gameplay and most importantly, the amount of items that I was able to gather. \n\nThe thing is that back in that time there was no proper way to monetize the in-game assets you had. Only through shady websites was that possible, and sometimes people would also sell cracked items that got deleted after game patches as they were in reality not legit. NFTs address this crucial aspect: ability to buy and sell items, and to know that they are legitimate. In addition, blockchain games have a lot of possibilities for building reputation systems using on-chain activity to detect fraudulent behavior, something I should have been definitely banned for in my time :D\n\nThere is a strong trend currently towards P2E idle games that essentially function as NFT and token minting machines where they generate tokens and allow to breed assets to a certain point where the early players have gotten a strong enough position that it becomes inaccessible to the new players. In trading terms, I would be short on these type of projects.\n\nHowever, we are seeing a really cool wave of Triple A games announcing their GameFi and P2E economies which in trading terms I would be very bullish on. In the short term there definitely will be a lot of browser based P2E games getting a lot of hype, but in the long run the Triple A desktop / console games will most likely bring the GameFi space into the next level.",

We didn't just choose an acronym for Oasis, we chose a statement with historical meaning that we felt embodied the way our team deeply considers every single decision we make. \n\nA large part of the inspiration behind our name comes from what an Oasis represents. We are the Oasis of privacy in the privacy desert that's the current web. You could also take some James Halliday references to Ready Player One with the metaverse they build and live in being called the \u201cOasis\u201d, but that\u2019s more of a coincidence and might come up later on during some puzzle campaigns I\u2019m working on.  \ud83d\ude09\r  \n\r  \nWhat's even more exciting, is the $ROSE name selection which was actually thought out in incredible detail. \ud83d\ude0e\r  \n\r  \n**\ud83c\udf39ROSE: A Symbol of Privacy \ud83d\udc40**\r  \nWe wanted the token to stand as a representation for the network and Roses fit very well with this imagery. Historically they have often represented \u201csecrecy\u201d. Dating back to Ancient Greece, the Rose was seen as a symbol for secrets or privacy, used by Aphrodite as a gift in exchange for keeping the secrets of Gods.\r  \n\r  \nIn Ancient Rome this symbolism continued and the phrase \u201csub rosa\u201d or \u201cunder the rose\u201d was to mean \u201cdone in secret\u201d or \u201cunder a pledge of secrecy\u201d. This phrase and the symbol of Roses as secrecy extended throughout history with the British Tudors era where state secrets were decided in a room with a large rose hanging from the ceiling.\r  \n\r  \nThis fits well with our vision for the Oasis Network, which seeks to power the next generation of blockchain use cases through its unique capacity to support confidential computing and private data on the ledger.\r  \n\r  \nYou can read more about it in here: [https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/introducing-rose-the-oasis-network-token-cee031b5a532](https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/introducing-rose-the-oasis-network-token-cee031b5a532)",

The trick usually to distinguish real usage from hype is to look at the onchain transaction activity versus the price activity. Currently as the crypto market is small, it is still possible to have a disproportionate influence with hype marketing. In the long term, however, the measure of the success of the network will become the onchain activity it has. \n\nMuch like with \u2018normal\u2019 companies the valuation model is set based on their commercial activity. There will always be some premiums aside of tangible / non tangible assets and revenue, the thing in crypto currently is that the real usage is still small, which leaves a lot of room for that type of value, which hype is included in.\n\nOur approach to this is to focus on building. There\u2019s a lot of noise in the space, and we do not want to be distracted with all of that. Our goal is to support the teams that are building in the network, and to ensure the developer experience is as good as possible.

It is, that\u2019s what I\u2019m seeing as roughly half of all functioning dApps in the market are built on it. But you know the problem is Ethereum has its limitations like low throughput, poor user experience, tech stack which is not customizable as is its governance dependance.\n\nMany projects tried exploring Ethereum compatible blockchains as a way to mitigate these limitations, but the truth is there\u2019s no specialized framework to build such blockchains or protocols to connect them. I believe this where Polygon comes into the picture. \n\nPolygon is a remarkable blockchain with a slew of benefits. I mean processing 3.5 million transactions per day each costing less than one cent is something fantastic serving as a solution for Ethereum\u2019s congestion. Also offering a wide range of solutions for a variety of problems such as compatibility, scalability, security, interoperability, and modularity. \n\nKeep that in mind peeps, MATIC\u2019s aim is becoming the internet of blockchains whether you believe in it or not, making Ethereum accessible to everyone. I personally believe that such a strong network with already existing partnerships and successful products and future technical advantages are more than enough to secure Polygon\u2019s existence. So instead of looking at Ethereum and Polygon as competitors, I think we\u2019d better start understanding them as a synergy.",

There's a ton I think I understand but I probably don't and finally there's a whole lot of crap I just cannot wrap my head around no matter how hard I try. One thing I genuinely do not understand on an economic level is how some incredible projects are undervalued and some projects that honestly sometimes feel like they don't add anything or are just driven by hype are doing way better price or value wise.\n\nI understand that hype is a big thing but jesus godamn, sometimes the entire market as a whole feels like it's driven by hype and people's opinions on projects and investments are just as volatile as the market.\n\nI'm going to use Ethereum, Polygon, Cardano and Solana as an example. It was massive how much Solana was overhyped a year or two ago from now. This was it boys, this was the \"Eth killer\". Solana fanboys spread FUD about Ethereum and Polygon like the plague. Where are they now? The Solana team are known liars and VCs are literally moving to Polygon. It's all gone and I feel Polygon will replace Solana in the Top 10 in the future. We all know Ethereum is still king.\n\nCardano was and feels like it's straight up selling you a white paper. Incredibly over-valued and of course the old \"Eth killer\" narrative is used. Although I think Cardano is a great project and will do well, I do think it's over-valued and over-hyped.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is people are way too quick to get swept up by the hopium and the hype.  You must ground yourself in reality and shut out the noise. Hype comes and goes but projects putting in quality work despite the price not pumping the way you would like it to is a better long-term investment for me personally.

Crypto is supposed to be rewarding for hard work, not for large funds. Ethereum trying to reward the highest bidder makes it as power-hungry as the next guy.\n\nDon't get me wrong here, no one loves Ethereum more than I do, which is why I always tried to educate others on it and defend their negative aspects, such as the gas fees, and the long wait for transactions, but going to 2.0 makes it unfair for the little guy and it's time we talked about it.\n\nLet's not forget there are thousands of people across different social tiers who are fully invested in ETH mining gear, even many here in my little country, who will be absolutely rekt when the update comes in.\n\nThere are many things that Ethereum could spend time working on, many that are dire and require urgent solutions, like the smart contracts or constant attacks on the blockchain, to which they can offer an insurance fund of sorts (?) as how Kraken exchange has done or how soIana prime has implemented, or the long wait for transaction to which they can implement some micro-mining mechanism such as with the case of lota, but instead of solving these solutions, eth will collectively be moved to a new order, and few are posing questions about why is that.\n\nI hope Vitalik realizes that there are urgent things that need solutions before we can make the move.",

            "text": "In this post we're going to talk about AAVE an open source liquidity protocol in the context of stablecoin adoption. I feel like it's super necessary to have a \"home base\" of sort of. I think that's where stablecoins come in for a lot of us. The crypto market is like the PVP zone in an MMO and stablecoins are the main town. Stablecoins are usually pegged to fiat like USD or other cryptocurrencies like how DAI is pegged to Eth but anyway I'm sure you all knew this already.\n\nAAVE is basically a non-custodial liquidity protocol where you can earn interest rates on your deposits and where you can borrow assets as well. This launched on Ethereum long ago and has launched on Polygon as well as avax less than a year ago. Personally as far as these kinds of protocols are concerned, I feel like measures like accessibility are more important than market cap.\n\n In a system where how much money you're actually making comes down to the dynamics of borrowing and  lending, all the aspects of interest should be looked at in order to  have a better understanding, It's not just one variable we're working with here. Deposit index is one of the many factors  we can start with. Although the deposit index for stablecoins is almost always the same, APYs on Polygon are 6.89% on Polygon compared to 3.92% on Avalanche. So by depositing your stablecoins on Polygon using the same protocol, you would have outperformed everyone else.\n\nI urge you to DYOR as there are frankly many other factors to look into, I've simply only given you a taste but I will link what I used as reference. In hopes that you may be able to learn and piece it together for yourself.\n\n**references**:\n\n[Aavescan.com](https://Aavescan.com)\n\nhttps://dune.xyz/aavegrantsdao/Aave-Polygon-Growth-WIP",

It pays reflections, its super cheap, the dev team is great with the whitepaper and over delivering on promises made to the community. We\u2019re also preparing for 1% of RBIF to be burned once we hit 3000 holders. Which at the moment is sitting at about 31 left.

            "text": "Have you noticed that despite the overall situation crypto market some DeFi projects continue to gain traction.  \n\n\nIn the last two years, we saw the total TVL jump from  $10Bn in January 2022 to an ATH of over $110Bn in November 2021. Today the total value locked in DeFi sits at $74.5Bn according to Defipulse index.  \n\n\nIt is clear to me this is a one-way road! Adoption will keep increasing and we can already notice that a few \"regional\" DeFi projects are emerging such as Tropykus and Pods Finance which are aiming to South American crypto investors.   \n\n\nI just attended to Ethereum Rio conference and there I had the chance to know a few interesting projects developing here in Brazil and South America and the one I liked most was Tropykus. The CEO Mauricio Tovar gave an emotional speech about how Tropykus is impacting communities in the region. I honestly hope they achieve what they want as it's not common to see projects with both a social and environmental touch, and as a Brazilian, I reckon we need that.  \n\n\nAnd the truth is - every DeFi degen has a favorite project - Aave, Compound, Anchor, Yearn, and many many others. I'm personally staking UST on Anchor and staking on Dafi Protocol and Binance earn (ok, ok, I know! Binance!? Yeah... the APY isn't the best but I believe my funds are safu, right!?)  \n\n\nDecentralized Finance is also making the most of this situation and it is obvious as projects keep churning out announcements of integrations & partnerships with other crypto ecosystems - the future of crypto and DeFi will be completely and totally multichain and integrated, just like [Skylar](https://twitter.com/skylar_eth) from Eth Foundation said on his speech yesterday at ETH Rio.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I know the picture I took doesn't illustrate what I said above. Posting it just to prove I was there - hehehehe.](https://preview.redd.it/j2d3hr5fzqn81.png?width=899&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bc3601be916c229ae1d5a6fc8176913ad19a989)\n\n  \nIf you allow me I will use one my favorite DeFi project as an example.  \n\n\nDAFI protocol is making the best of the bear market by focusing mostly on building and developing while collaborating with crypto platforms. These include DeFi, GameFi, NFT, exchanges, etc. This is a significant move and it won't be a surprise to see major traction in terms of adoption. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOut of the 30+ integrations and partnerships in the past couple of months, the ones that struck the chord for me are the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network integration and the partnership with SolanaPrime. While the integration on  BSC Network significantly reduced gas fees, the partnership with SolanaPrime introduces staking 2.0 to all DeFi, GameFi, and Meterverse projects launching on the Solana-based launchpad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe partnership with SolanaPrime makes DAFI more promising as its innovative technology of reinventing how every decentralized network is rewarded & will be exposed to a strong ecosystem that ultimately builds support for the platform and influences price.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNotably, the sheer hard work and constant announcements of partnerships by the team is one more reason to bag DAFI and stake for some APY. For the likes of Brokoli Network and APY Finance, it\u2019s #buidl time as more users start to delve into DeFi with staking and Yield farming.  \n\n\nBrokoli Network\u2019s green DEX, dApp, API & NFT are set to help reduce DeFi\u2019s carbon footprint on the environment while Tropykus wants to expand the access of financial services to South American communities which usually would never have access to this kind of thing.  \n\n\nThe future is amazing and just like Skylar said yesterday \"we're still early\".",

Purchasing crypto with fiat and any unrealized appreciation is not a taxable event. However, the tax executive noted that selling crypto is a taxable event. He explained that \u201cThe gain or loss is generally capital in nature\u201d and that this could be taxed.\n\nEven if a holder exchanges their crypto for other assets like [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://swapzone.io/currencies/bitcoin?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) or [Ether (ETH)](https://swapzone.io/currencies/ethereum?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo), the EY executive noted that users have a \u201ctaxable event and are required to report gain or loss on the disposed crypto.\u201d\n\nThe same applies to nonfungible tokens. \u201cIf you purchased an NFT with fiat, no taxable event,\u201d . However, purchasing NFTs with crypto is treated very similarly to a crypto-for-crypto exchange. \u201cThe gross proceeds less your tax basis in the asset, generally including any associated fees/costs,\u201d said the crypto tax expert.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kavpsxxqxcn81.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=77380ef09deb82d700f92ad642060930a98f9b7e",

They are entitled to the benefits of success because they have stuck with the project from the beginning. A crypto launchpad is the greatest place to look for a startup project.\n\nThe cost of launching in a crypto launchpad is inexpensive (or non-existent), an increasing number of companies are turning to them for funding.\n\nSome examples are BSCPad, the first launchpad based on the BSC Network. The platform\u2019s fully decentralized protocol assists blockchain-based projects with fundraising, token distribution, and increased liquidity.\n\nAXL is being built as a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on the Ethereum Chain (ETH) and the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) that will allow staking, liquidity provision, yield farming,  launching IDO. The launchpad will allow any coin to operate as a tier token. By simply establishing a smart contract, projects could have their own launchpad. It claims to solve real-life problems.\n\nBut what is unique about AXL launchpad, I understand each Participant will be able to buy up to $50, and in total 600 users. This means after passing the due diligence, new startups will be able to raise up to 30K in a Private Round. \n\nSo, ideally new projects and great ideas have that have no liquidity to start can have  a chance to launch, So, I think AXL seems to be solving problems\n\nBullPerks is also a decentralized VC and multi-chain crypto launchpad, best known for its transparent and community-dedicated approach.\n\nIn recent years, launchpads have become increasingly popular, benefiting both startups and crypto investors.\n\nDo you have any other DEX launchpads that are unique and solve problems?",

The transaction volume of DeFi continues to grow at an exponential rate every year. I found DeFi very interesting so I did some research.  \n\n\nDeFi is big business. There are more and more DeFi ecosystems that provide us with all these useful services. A user with a crypto wallet can trade digital assets, get loans, or take out insurance, among many other things. Platforms like Kaiba (decentralized gas-efficient infrastructure) made me realize how big an impact DeFi has and it will certainly transform business financial services. Even the transaction banking industry is beginning to see DeFi's potential to overhaul the inflexibility of present processes.  \n\n\nYou can think of DeFi in layers:  \nThe blockchain \u2013 Ethereum contains the transaction history and state of accounts.  \nThe assets \u2013 ETH and the other tokens (currencies).  \nThe protocols \u2013 smart contracts that provide the functionality, for example, a service that allows for decentralized lending of assets.  \nThe applications \u2013 the products we use to manage and access the protocols  \n\n\nLending platforms, such as Compound and Aave, together with decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and Curve, cemented their positions as the market-leading protocols with the first-mover advantage.

It would take forever to complete transactions and those transactions wouldn\u2019t even be worth it considering the gas fees will most likely be higher than the actual transaction itself.\n\nThis might be the only flaw with Ethereum. The developers didn\u2019t really think they\u2019d see this amount of success so fast and didn\u2019t implement a built-in scaling solution.\n\nThere are talks about the move to PoS making Ethereum more bearable but I still think we\u2019re gonna have to resort scaling solutions like Cartesi and other similar ones for low fees and fast transactions.\n\nSo let\u2019s just appreciate these projects for now and not take them for granted. I really can\u2019t imagine how the market would operate without them. It would simply break right then and there",

            "text": " We all love to talk about crypto adoption and how we are getting closer there. But how far have we really come and how close are we?\n\nI believe the adoption is going to happen on multiple frontiers, but I'll like to talk about that of web3 crypto payment. Originally, bitcoin served as nothing but a means of decentralized payment. People mined lots of bitcoin and used them to settle transactions over the internet. These were usually gamers, developers and dark web folks. Today, the crypto space is so massive, so much more than payments is happening. People no longer buy bitcoin just as a medium of exchange, but also as a speculative asset. Most of the wallets owning bitcoin haven't spent their bitcoin according to recent studies. A consequence of this is that people are not easily willing to exchange their bitcoin for goods and services.\n\nThen there is also the problem of transfer fees which comes with moving cryptocurrencies from one wallet to another. It could be more expensive than what it costs to move fiat, especially using ERC20. On the side of the receiver, which could be individuals, institutions, providers of services, business and merchants in general, there is this fear of being paid in volatile cryptocurrencies. Paying for a $200 item using bitcoin is cool, but in the next few hours, that bitcoin could be worth $195 or $205. If the bitcoin isn't converted to fiat the moment it is received, there is a chance it won't reflect the same price over time.\n\nThese issues and more prove to be a hindrance to adoption of cryptocurrency payment. Projects like Cryptocom, Utrust, Kasta are trying to solve this issue. I\u2019m more familiar with Utrust\u2019s approach to the problem. Utrust is a cryptocurrency payment platform that has tackled most of the issues people face with using crypto for payment. Originally built in the Ethereum blockchain, UTK, the token of Utrust, is migrating to the Elrond network, which would make transactions faster and cheaper imo. They are already cheaper to use than traditional payment services like PayPal or bank transfers. They have over 10,000 merchants who integrate with their solution and this gives the users access to virtually everything they could need. Their merchants cut across the automobile industry, travel, arts and NFTs, real estate, eCommerce and so on. The user can choose to pay with stable coins or with popular cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Elrond  and Utrust token. Merchants can also choose to receive in those crypto or in fiat to avoid volatility.\n\nAs an incentive to use the platform, users can earn 0.5% or 1.5% cashback when they stake 1,000 or 20,000 UTK. In the new tokenomics coming later, users and merchants will always earn cash back whenever they transact, but will earn higher (+yield) when they stake UTK and EGLD tokens. The project is also a DAO to enable participants to control how the platform would operate in the future. \n\nSo guys, what do you think? Is this good news on how far we have come with the adoption or what?\n\n[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/utrust](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/utrust)\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kasta/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kasta/)\n\n[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cronos](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cronos)",

I mean day-to-day trading might bring you some income, but it will definitely not make you rich. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m investing in DeFi and web3 projects. These are supposed to be having some decent future especially that both these spaces are increasing in value. For example, I\u2019m keeping BIT in my portfolio, and I recently added some more after the news of Redbull racing holding some of this lmfao.Also I\u2019m keeping bags of Ethereum. \n\nThis is the kind of projects I meant when I said that I\u2019d rather put my money in long-term investments. I mean I can\u2019t imagine myself opening and closing positions daily or investing in a dogcoin, this kind of moves will definitely get me wrecked in a bear market. What y\u2019all think?",

According to research from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, those wallets have attracted $22.2 million worth of crypto so far.\n\nThe prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum plunged Wednesday night after news that Russia had invaded Ukraine. Bitcoin dropped back below $35,000, and Ethereum dropped below $2,400 \u2014 though both had risen by Friday afternoon. As of Monday morning, Bitcoin was back over $40,000 and Ethereum was near $2,800.\n\nThis activity is why decentralization of money is important. Imagine trying to move fiat, you would face restrictions. The coming of decentralized payments means like Bitcoin and Decentralized Exchanges like Fomodex.io is a blessing. Truth be told.",

Meanwhile, the ruble hit a new low against the dollar on Monday, falling below one US cent, and has remained there ever since.  Many investors tried to get out of the ruble after it lost it\u2019s value after all the sanctions.\n\nAnother reason driving up crypto prices is rising skepticism among certain newer investors about government measures that impact currency prices, such as the economic penalties imposed on Russia this week. \n\nMany of my friends jumped into crypto in the last market crash, and they convinced me to jump in too. They recommended me to diverify my portfolio in Bitcoin and Ethereum, and some low market cap projects like Parrotly Finance. So far my crypto journey has been great and I\u2019m not planning to sell any time soon.",

Those who have been here for long time, know that the market operates in cycles, and altcoins act following Bitcoin\u2019s price actions. So do you guys think we will be seeing an altseason taking place soon?\n\nPersonally, I really hope that we get back to normal and that the market continues to pump. I think that\u2019s the normal thing to happen right now, because most of the cryptocurrencies are undervalued and they have a lot of improvement to do in terms of the charts. Also, the market has been going down for the past 2-3 months, so now is the time for the correction to happen. So I really believe we might be on the verge of a new bull-run. \n\nIf you ask me, I\u2019d recommend everyone to go and fil their bags with altcoins, definitely something with real utility. I guess these are the ones that will be pumping soon.\n\nFor my part, I filled big bags of Ethereum and BitDAO. I\u2019d say that BitDAO and Ethereum are among the assets that can be easily held for a long term. Aslso, these projects are yet to fulfill their potential and their ecosystems are still growing. I mean Ethereum definitely still has a lot of room for growth, and BitDAO is holding the largest treasury in the crypto space, and both of these projects are in the heart of web3, which makes them real contenders to be among the top performers in the market.\n\nThis is why I believe this is a critical time for all investors to act and to start filling their portfolios with alts that do have a potential. Let me know what y\u2019all have been doing recently.",

The transactions are peer-to-peer regardless of where the sender and receiver are situated. There is no need to justify your payment or pay the exorbitant costs associated with many foreign transfers conducted through central banks.\n\n Cryptocurrencies have a bright future, but the general people will need time to understand the power of an autonomous decentralised monetary system. So far, shady places have wielded more power than real works.\n\nPeople should invest in good projects that solve real-world problems, such as algorand, which solves the efficiency problem and has the potential to create its own eco system, similar to how ethereum, polkadot, and xrp are changing the waves defi sector, or bob eco coin, which is unique and has social and cultural implications and working in ev sector.\n\nAnother effect of cryptocurrencies that we may anticipate in future technologies is much improved and mature blockchain versions.

The invasion's announcement sent Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies down at first.Since then, the US government has retaliated against Russia's invasion with tough economic penalties, which have helped cryptocurrency values recover from their initial price drop.\n\nThere are a few voices of hope in the crypto world among all the doom and gloom.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum and a Russian citizen, has spoken out against Russia's invasion, saying that the country should not have given up hope of a peaceful conclusion. \n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the CEO of FTX, has committed to help Ukrainian traders financially. Bankman-Fried declared on Twitter that any Ukrainian account holder enrolled on the FTX cryptocurrency platform is entitled for $25 in free money, writing: \"\"we just awarded $25 to everyone Ukrainian on FTX do what you need do.\"\"  With many people storing their money in crypto, I think I will store it in $AGFI and BTC. Hopefully the war calms down and everything goes back to how it once used to be.",

Those tokens are subsequently burned and removed from circulation.\n\nThen, the same number of tokens are unlocked out of the bridge contract on the Ethereum side and allocated to the user's address (wallet) that sent in the tokens on the BNB side. These tokens are then claimable by that address. This allows those tokens to re-enter circulation. The bridge will be in place at launch and allow arbitrage trading on both sides\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSubreddit: r/AccelDefi\n\nWebsite (\\[[https://www.acceldefi.com/\\](https://www.acceldefi.com/)](https://www.acceldefi.com/](https://www.acceldefi.com/)))",

            "text": "Here is a list of interesting projects to check out, all of which are distinct from one another.\n\nWhat are the best metaverse-based cryptocoins?\nLet\u2019s talk about 3 metaverse crypto coins:\n\n1.        Star Atlas\nThe virtual gaming metaverse Star Atlas is set in the year 2620.\n\nThree different factions have emerged in the distant future:\n\n1. Humankind governs the MUD territory..\n\n2. As a group of aliens, the ONI region\n\n3.Sentient androids command the USTUR sector.\n\nThese factions are engaged in a never-ending battle for resources, territory, and political dominance. You, as a Star Atlas faction citizen, will have the power to influence the outcome of this intergalactic conflict while also earning rewards for your contributions.\n\nStar Atlas is a perfect example of what can be achieved when cutting-edge blockchain, real-time graphics, multiplayer video games, and decentralised financial technologies come together.\n\nThe Star Atlas universe is based on the Grand Strategy multiplayer genre, which allows for engaging, long-term gameplay as factions battle it out in a universal space cape that is constantly in flux. Players stake real-world assets in order to expand their in-game corporate empires, discover new and distant alien worlds, engage in high-stakes combat, and shape the game's features and future with earned political power.\n\n2.        Decentraland\n\nThe Decentraland (MANA) Ethereum token powers a virtual reality platform called Decentraland. In Decentraland, MANA can be used to buy both virtual land plots and in-world products and services..\n\nMANA is a digital asset token that can be used to pay for goods and services in Decentraland.\n\nIt is Ethereum-based and follows the ERC20 token standard. It can be bought and traded for fiat currency or other digital currencies. MANA is a cryptocurrency that can be stored in a cryptocurrency wallet and custodian.\n\n\n3.        Metakawn\nA slightly new and unique project with a strong focus on community.\n\nMetakawn, a project focused on the Modern Muslim generation. This is the First Metaverse for Modern Muslims who share the same values in a Halal EcoSystem. Instead of relying on brand sponsorship and/or social media networks, a platform that allows Muslim creators to earn a fair living from their community.",

Last week I read an online [article](https://capital.com/metisdao-metis-price-prediction) about Layer 2 scaling protocol called Metis that provides help with all these problems such as expensive gas fees, slow transactions that are characteristic for ETH.  \n\n\nI wanted to ask you for your opinion about Metis, I was so busy in the last few days I hadn't time to sit and write you about this, but I would like to know a little bit more about it from your personal experience since I need some solution and help with problems I'm dealing it using ETH.  \n\n\nAll this I've read sounds really great as you can see: The platform has various use cases: supporting users to build their own NFT minting and trading business, yield farming, launchpad, decentralized exchange (DEX), investment business, or their own token. Metis is well-suited for powering the sharing economy through dApps that offer affordable and speedy micropayments.  \n\n\nSo, what do you think?",

It could be tough to experience the ecosystem in such condition and unless ETH2.0 comes there's a big barrier. Luckily scaling solutions exist. These can help you experience ETH Dapps while costing a fraction of gas fees.\n\nMost popular solution currently is Polygon. While other solutions like Arbitrum and ZKsync are coming up. So I ask you what is your favorite scaling solution and why? I've been using AURORA these days and it has been a great experience since it is relatively new and the ecosystem offers great rewards on farming. It was also gas free until very recently.",

But I want to ask everyone with those feelings, what are you doing about it? \n\n\n\nAre you buying the dip and practicing DCA on good trusted cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum or you any of your favorite coins, or are you stocking up on trusted DeFi coins like Aggregated Finance or PankakeSwap. If you aren't using this buying opportunity to stock on on some crypto at a discount, then you won't make a lot of profit in the bull market compared to buying and DCA now, and diamond hands till we reach the moon.\n\n\nI get it you are fearful on your hard earned money, but we all know we have a risk factor in crypto, even in bitcoin and ethereum. But we all have to hold strong our crypto to reach the moon.",

            "text": "Hopefully this isn't considered spamming because mods from r/cc removed my post over there. Interested to see what other people's picks for 2018 are!\n\nIf you thought 2017 was a ripper year for crypto, I think you're in for a big surprise in 2018! I'm not a serious finanical investor nor a professional giving advice but I wanted to share a few projects I'm excited for moving into 2018. Please follow up on this post by doing your own research and I hope you come to some of the same conclusions I did.\n\nI get quite a few people PMing me asking me to share how I decide to invest in a coin. I use a rather strict methodology to ensure I only invest in future-proof technologies. It also means the coins I invest in will be more likely to survive dips and bear markets.\n\n**My methodology**\n\nI think the most important rule is to not chase pump and dumps. Research every coin that you think has potential and make decisions from there. \n\nPersonally I only invest in coins with:\n\n * Solid and usable technology\n\n * Clear future use-case\n\n * Transparent researchable team\n\n * Evidence of active GitHub or code or working product\n\n * Token has value within the project (inherently part of the ecosystem)\n\nIf a coin is missing one of these characteristics, it needs to be super strong in another field to make up for it.  Honestly the biggest gains I have made are the projects I researched thoroughly, believed in and then HODLed, even through all the dips.\n\n**Core picks**\n\nThese are the projects I believe have proved themself worthy of the long hold. I liken them to bluechip shares, they will hold (relative) value through dips but still have the potential to increase exponentially with adoption.\n\n * **[Raiblocks](http://wcibtc.com/xrb)** - Rai does one thing, and one thing well: fast and free transactions. It is honestly the perfect currency. The only know issue currently is potential spam attacks but the devs say they are working on this. It currently lacks data storage and smart contract functionality, but that can all be added later through different layer solutions. Really excited for this one!\n\n * **[IOTA](http://wcibtc.com/iota)** - DAG based data-network build for machine to machine transactions where you complete proof of work for 2 other transactions before yours is processed. People also seem to forget that IOTA software is only half of the picture; The IOTA devs have been working on processor hardware that can complete proof of work at a machine level. Expect big things of IOTA in the next few months as they ramp up annoucements.\n\n * **[Monero](http://wcibtc.com/xmr)** - The best privacy coin. As long as everyone is able to see all your transaction and wallet history, crypto will never be suitable for real-world adoption. Monero is tackling this problem head on.\n\n * **[Factom](http://wcibtc.com/factom)** - A token which builds off other blockchains to store financial contracts and data. Multiple grants from Dept of Homeland Security and Bill & Melinda Gates foundation. Working with Linxens (one of the largest RFID and passport manufacturers in the world) on Smart Identity products. They already have multiple Fortune 100 customers that will be annouced in Q1 2018 who are already implementing their products.\n\n * **[OmiseGo](http://wcibtc.com/omg)** - Finance and payment provider. Once they launch their own blockchain in 2018, all their current transactions will be routed through it with portions of the dividends being paid to OMG holders.\n\n * **[Binance Coin](http://wcibtc.com/binance-coin)** - Binance is now the number one altcoin exchange in the world. Their token is used to lower fees and they have been burning them to lower supply. With a limited number of tokens and the exchange traffic increases, the price of BNB tokens will be a good litmus test of the crypto environment.\n\n * **[Request Network](http://wcibtc.com/req)** - Full suite of auditing, finance and payment software powered by the blockchain. They launched their testnet on the Rinkeby Ethereum testnetwork the other week and it is absolutely fantastic. It will eventually expand to include other cryptos and fiat. One of my most exciting and promising holds.\n\n * **[Neo](http://wcibtc.com/neo)** - Smart contract and do-it-all platform. Often refered to as chinese ethereum with good reason. NEO has a huge developer community and HongFei has tweeted recently about being in talks with the Chinese government to provide a standardised platform to stick to their regulations. Perfect vehicle for Chinese capital to flow into the crypto ecosystem.\n\n * **[Stellar](http://wcibtc.com/xlm)** - Partnership with IBM speaks more then I can shill. A solid project\n\n * **[Ethereum](http://wcibtc.com/ethereum)** - Ever taken a glance over the top 300ish coins and realised how many of them are ERC20 Ethereum based tokens?Ethereum will flourish in 2018 as more DApps are released. Can't go wrong with Ethereum\n\n**Volatile picks**\n\nWhile I wouldn't consider these picks risky by my methodology, they lack the long term credibility and are probably more prone to volatile behaviour. Higher volatility means higher potential gains, but higher chance of loss.\n\n * **[UTrust](http://wcibtc.com/utrust)** - Payment platform system with the world's first inbuilt cryptocurrency consumer protections. If you missed REQ, now is your time to get in at the ground floor. Huge team and looks very solid.\n\n * **[Chainlink](http://wcibtc.com/chainlink)** - Decentralized oracles for linking real world applications with blockchain applications. I know 4chan has shilled Chainlink to death but if they can deliver what they promise it will be a top 20 coin.  \n\n * **[Quantstamp](http://wcibtc.com/quantstamp)** - Smart Contract auditing. Token holders also receive a free airdrop of every smart contract they audit. Backed by Ycomb. Ready to pop!\n\n * **[Bounty0x](http://wcibtc.com/bounty0x)** -A decentralized bounty hunting platform enabling anyone to manage bounty programs, and bounty hunters to receive payment for completing bounty tasks. Already have a working product and have gained some notoriety for hunting down the EtherDelta hacker. Solid concept and very low marketcap currently.\n\n * **[Horizon State Decision Token](http://wcibtc.com/decision-token)** - Australian startup focusing on providing a immutable polling and election results. One of the best uses of blockchain technology I have ever seen. They already have their product integrated in MiVote and are launching fully next year.\n\n * **[Eidoo](http://wcibtc.com/eidoo)** - A managed wallet with identity addons. Fantastic team and very professional looking. \n\n * **[Modum](http://wcibtc.com/modum)** - Real time tracking for (legal) drugs in Europe. Credible team and has a working product. A solid pick that will see more attention as it's real-world roll-out starts\n\nHappy new year 2018!",

Either way, they are essentially trying to get into the market of online gambling, a currently-several hundred billion dollar market. They have working tech (which is actually very well done, go try it for yourself if you are interested), a reputable and experienced team with great connections, and little to no competition in this area of the market. I am not going to overly shill FUN, but if you are interested, I encourage you to do your own research and find out for yourself if it is a coin of interest. The current MCAP is still very low in comparison to their 2018 timeline, assuming that they live up to their word.\n\nEdit: I would still consider FUN a \u2018volatile\u2019 pick for the time being",

Ether's use case is to power Dapps, which isn't really a use-case in and of itself, but its an investment in the future potential of Dapps. ARK is similar in that it meets all the qualifications on OP's list, except a specific, foreseeable use-case. (I think there are a couple projects popping up that are branches of the ARK blockchain, not sure how useful they are *yet*.) ARK uses a much more efficient verification protocol than ETH, (and a couple other neat features built into the network) but is still a budding project relative to the goliath that is ETH. So, pros and cons, but should definitely make the list.",

The transfer of NFTs from initial sale to any subsequent resale is recorded immutably on the blockchain, so all parties involved can easily verify the authenticity of the ticket. Even cooler, in cases where resale of tickets is strictly forbidden, NFTs can be programmed as non-transferrable, so they physically cannot be moved to another buyer.\n* **Perpetual revenue:** As programmable digital assets NFTs can have built-in rules for resales, merchandise, content and royalty splits. This means that the organiser can determine profit sharing percentages for any future resales or downstream creative content on secondary markets, and reliably receive these funds knowing they are unalterable within the NFT\u2019s coding.\n* **New revenue opportunities:** NFTs put tickets into the realm of programmable money, opening up unlimited potential for new revenue opportunities. For example resale of NFT tickets as **collectables,** using NFT tickets as a gateway for giving food and drink deals, even rewarding super fans who have collected a certain number of event tickets.\n\nOver the past year the NFT tickets have gained more attention in the crypto space. I have compiled extensive list of developers, investors, financial instintutions, ticketing companies and NBA owners that have advocated the benefits of NFT ticketing\n\n **Mark Cuban \u2013 Entrepreneur, shark and owner of the Dallas Mavericks** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mxtowrn4r7g81.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=b136df5f401c2b96e18ec2f730ed8be90dea1f01\n\n **Gary Vaynerchuk - CEO of** **Vaynermedia**\\*\\*, Creator of veefriends\\*\\* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/racoxoa7r7g81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ee1e8dacce4aa177bbd5e6acc8d28655a9b0324\n\n **Jack Groetzinger \u2013 CEO Seatgeek** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6mrqrz9r7g81.png?width=359&format=png&auto=webp&s=543bcc908a9595bb1ef6b0b6833bbc6dc9e39c83\n\n **Ted Leonsis \u2013 owner of NBA's Wizards, the NHL's Capitals, the WNBA's Washington Mystics** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nqdc3s0dr7g81.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=46fdacbdeac0f0fdadf1d7bd6830464e947398e2\n\n \n\n**Barry Ritholtz \u2013 co-founder of Ritholtz wealth mangement \u2013 2 billions usd under management**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1uni3sggr7g81.png?width=455&format=png&auto=webp&s=58315aa34030c765c62263b73d3f3c42e46bb86a\n\n **Coinmarketcap** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xf645lvjr7g81.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=9302749976153bc70298effdbf755c363ee2afaa\n\n **Bankless** \\- Carly Reilly\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/echesa5nr7g81.png?width=368&format=png&auto=webp&s=c76733e2e6cbf65ff0111c1169b11684092f364f\n\n **Grayscale - Worlds largest crypto asset manager** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cm2bja5sr7g81.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bb50d036090b6c5a289655e11ddf6e1ea76758e\n\n**Snoop Dogg**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmk8d86xt7g81.png?width=316&format=png&auto=webp&s=56140160d688037f9c2628ee1b8e116ed059f09f\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Vitalik Buterin - co-founder Ethereum** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wp0jpcvr7g81.png?width=345&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebbf9385fc7040321fd62d505f9cd75261b30675",

This is a frequent talking point among people who aren't into NFTs or crypto, and one that should be addressed.\n\nI think the clearest answer is that decentralization and transparency alone create a superior product, prone to less potential profiteering, grifting, and fraud. As long as the chain is active and being maintained, it has the potential to outlast any centralized company database, especially as the technology matures. It doesn't need to even be significantly better to become the standard.\n\nIf someone can come up with a clear use case in which NFT ticketing is superior, and does something a centralized company database cannot do, then let me know.",

So I decided to check 3 random services and hope you'll help me to pick the best one for me. I'm sorry if you won't agree with me as I'm new to it. So I am ready to hear your opinion and your choise in that niche.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Binance\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first thing I've mentioned is that I have to enter my email in order to create the account. It looks strange, especially when everyone worry about their privacy. It's a minus, I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe good thing is that it promises to have the lowest trading fees which is very important. But I can change only crypto-pairs on Binance, so when I'll decide to change crypto to USD for withdrawal - I'll have to look for another place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the whole, it's very easy to create a wallet there and do different kinds of exchanges.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Coinbase\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd the same thing from the beginning - it asks for email during the registration. Guys, have you heard of privacy?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis platform is well-known as the best exchange website for crypto newbies. It deals with the major coins only and it provides a lot of trading volume and liquidity. I think that it can suit me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo tell the truth there's nothing more to say about that service, just that it's easy to use and widely known. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. EtherMium\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEtherMium is an example of a decentralized exchange service. Moreover it doesn't require any registration in order to create a wallet, which is very important for privacy as I understood. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt has an advantage over the centralized cervices - the trading is anonymous there, unless you identify your wallet as being yours. I like the point that I can create Ethereum wallet but it's posible to exchange only tokens there. So if I'll prefer the major coins - it will not suit me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut if I'll do token trading - I could take part in affiliate program and get 50% from the profit. It's a good bonus, I think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the whole, the service is good-looking, easy to navigate but it really lacks major coins. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what can you advice me to try? Are these services good or it's better to choose something else?",

Last week Yourticketprovider announced that it would turn its 2 million tickets sold annually into NFT tickets.\n\n**Interest of NFT tickets in the ticketing industry**\n\nIn the ticketing industry, NFT tickets have recently gained a lot of popularity. **Mark Cuban and Ted Leonsis (NBA team owners)** both see the added value of NFT tickets and want to turn their tickets into NFTs. Additionally, major ticketing companies like **Ticketmaster and Seatgeek** are actively working on implementing NFT ticketing. Ticketmaster recently launched a FAQ for its NFT ticket marketplace. Seatgeek hired a blockchain executive as VP of engineering and Seatgeek plans to roll out NFT ticketing for the NFL and NBA. Furthermore there is interest from non-crypto institutional investment funds in NFT ticketing and GET protocol (an NFT ticketing solution). **Barry Ritholtz** (founder and chairman of **Ritholtz Wealth Management, 2.3 billion** assets under its management) wrote about the topic in his personal blog.\n\n**Benefits of NFT tickets include:**\n\n**Increased profitability -** Total control and insights over the primary & secondary market. Take in the profit that would have gone to scalpers.\n\n**Collectible** \\- Tickets become tradable digital collectibles (NFTs), with a variety of awesome possibilities for fans & event organizers.\n\n**Unrivalled data** \\- Clear, verifiable data on ticket ownership, vastly improving marketing efforts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Benefits of NFT ticketing](https://preview.redd.it/xbojxtbmjun71.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=af3400f6b023e4e8f76217d3a77c4cb87ba86b09)\n\n**Adoption**\n\nYouticketprovider partnered with GET protocol this week to turn their **2 million tickets sold annually into NFT tickets**. Yourticketprovider will use the digital twin product that allows ticketing companies to easily integrate NFT ticketing. **GET protocol** is one of the main projects developing and selling NFT tickets. So far 9 ticketing companies are using the white label product of GET protocol. In total more than **800k tickets have been sold using GET protocol**. Ticket sales have been limited the past 1.5 year because of the global pandemic. I expect that the NFT ticket sales will see exponential growth as restrictions for events will get lifted globally.\n\nWhat I personally like is that all ticket sales can be easily checked and verified on chain using the NFT ticket explorer.\n\nNFT ticket explorer:\n\n[https://explorer.get-protocol.io/](https://explorer.get-protocol.io/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[NFT ticket explorer](https://preview.redd.it/krdbbfykjun71.jpg?width=862&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=707ae604e9309d671e1ef8e9a2f7fcda45f5999e)\n\n**Crypto Partnerships**\n\n**Polygon**\n\nGET protocol switched from Ethereum to polygon this year. Polygon was necessary to scale the NFT ticketing solution efficiently\n\n**Chainlink**\n\nLast year GET protocol integrated Chainlink\u2019s verified randomness tool.

It has a product that is tried and tested in real life with consumer using it that don't know anything about crypto. GET has the first mover advantage. Furthermore GET has already onboarded 9 ticketing companies. The biggest one is Yourticketprovider that sells 2 million tickets yearly. Yourticketprovider is also part of CM.com, a publicly listed company that is valued at 1.1 billion. It shows that companies of that size prefer to use the NFT ticketing solution developed by GET protocol instead of developing their own. \n\nAdditionally, there is very little competition in the NFT ticketing space. There are a few other projects focussed on NFT ticketing, but none of those are on a public blockchain where the transactions can be tracked. None of the other projects have onboarded the number of clients GET has or have sold anywhere close to the number of tickets GET has sold. It is the only NFT ticketing project that has a scaleable solution for NFT ticketing (as far as I am aware, please list any if you found a project that sells a decent number of tickets)",

There is also a buyback program. See the latest report. Instead of burning the tokens there was a recent change that the tokens bought back from the openmarket will be put in the DAO. The DAO can decide whether to burn or use it for further development.\n\nhttps://medium.com/get-protocol/burnback-report-q2-2021-5314bfdef2d3#:~:text=The%20GET%20Protocol%20processed%20a,647%20GET%20has%20been%20burned.\n\nThere are also other angles currently being developed to add more value to the token. Like developing DeFi for for the ticketing industry. Ticketing companies can pre-fund events with the NFT tickets as colleteral. \n\nhttps://medium.com/get-protocol/decentralizing-event-financing-liquidity-x-defi-x-nfts-975f028135f5\n\nBe also sure to check out the social channels of GET on reddit and telegram (the community is mostly active on telegram).

Their STARK-Based Ethereum compatible roll-up is going to be massive. No other chain is putting this much work into ZK aka No other chain is putting this much work into the future.\n\nPeople will constantly complain that the price isn't moving, but who cares for the short term? I don't. I'm aware of the fact that when you're bringing in the cutting edge tech that they've been bringing in then the price will follow. It's already happening, be patient.",

            "text": "**TL;DR:** The Sharpe Ratio is an excellent tool to assess risk-adjusted return on an investment. 4 cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Dash, Monero, and Bitcoin Cash) all have Sharpe Ratio\u2019s over 2, which signals a good investment per risk involved.\n\n## The Long Version\n\nHow many people have told you that cryptocurrencies are too risky? A fraud? A\nPonzi Scheme?\n\n**Bitcoin has increased over 1,500% over the last year**, but none of this is\nnew. Cryptocurrencies have been on a tear unlike anything we have ever seen\u2026just\nlook at how it compares to the various bubbles of the past:\n\n*Full Disclosure: not calling it a bubble\u2026just providing context!*\n\n[Comparison of Bitcoin to Past Bubbles](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1250/1*8rJh4eLCMoTZ-ZrUp1JAIQ.jpeg)\n\nBut you\u2026you are a **savvy investor**.\n\nOutsized gains tell us nothing except **something increased from a little to\nalot**.\n\n## Total Returns are not adjusted for risk\n\nLet\u2019s take the following quiz\u2026one is the right answer, but you won\u2019t be graded\nfor it.\n\n**Which of the following investments would you rather be in?**\n\n1.  Crypto A started at $1, went to $500, back down to $1, back up to $600\n1.  Crypto B started at $1, went to $100, to $300, to $600\n\nBoth investments have the same return, but which would you choose?\n\nI\u2019ll give you some ti\u2026oh you already have an answer? You choose #2?\n\n**Exactly.**\n\nMost investors look at total returns over various timeframes \u2014 one-day,\none-month, one-year\u2014 when evaluating an investment. **These returns are\nmisleading since they aren\u2019t adjusted for risk**.\n\nJust look at the example above \u2014Crypto A made a massive return on the initial\ninvestment, but that does not mean it was a compelling investment opportunity.\n\n> \u201cUsing volatility as a measure of risk is nuts. Risk to us is 1) the risk of\n> permanent loss of capital, or 2) the risk of inadequate return.\u201d \u2014 Charlie\nMunger\n\nIf only there was a better way\u2026\n\n## What is the Sharpe Ratio?\n\n[The ELI5 Version of the Sharpe Ratio](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1250/1*bsWK2jozQar9k7ZwQCrgeg.png)\n\nThe Sharpe ratio is a measure used heavily in the finance world for calculating\nrisk-adjusted returns.\n\nThe calculation solves the issue of misleading total returns by taking the\naverage return earned above the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total\nrisk \u2014 an absolute measure of risk.\n\nInvestors can directly compare multiple investments and evaluate the amount of\nrisk taken on to generate the same percentage points of return, **which makes\nfor a much fairer comparison**.\n\nWhile this does make for a much better comparison, you are smart and know that\neven though something may have a higher Sharpe Ratio, that does not indicate it\nis less volatile\u2026the higher ratio actually indicated that the investment\nrisk-to-reward profile is much better or proportional vs. another.\n\nSo for this article, I will show you how to implement the Sharpe Ratio in the\nwonderful world of cryptocurrencies.\n\n## Top Cryptocurrencies by Sharpe Ratio\n\nWith your new, sweet investment tool, you can calculate the Sharpe Ratios of top\ncryptocurrencies.\n\nBut because I love you (and to save time), I went ahead and did it for you:\n\n[Top 12 Cryptocurrencies by Sharpe Ratio](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1250/1*mRR09Qh9t2zsJKWdyOCCgA.png)\n\nNot surprisingly, Bitcoin ranks as the top risk-adjusted earning cryptocurrency\nfrom the top 12. Even though Bitcoin is very volatile, the returns have matched\nthe craziness.\n\nWhat is interesting to me, is all the way at the bottom \u2014 our dear friend NEO,\naka the \u201cChinese Ethereum\u201d. A Sharpe Ratio of 0.03 in an industry of 1s, 2s, 3s,\nand a 4 is honestly\u2026terrible. But a large portion of this is due to NEO\nstumbling out of the gate after getting listed on Bitfinex, with returns of\n-18%, -13%, and -24% in the first 10 days of trading.\n\n## My Gift to you \u2014 a tool to automatically calculate Sharpe Ratio\n\nA post from me would not be complete without a tool for you to utilize what we\njust talked about.\n\nThe spreadsheet pulls in the top 12 cryptocurrencies from the Bitfinex exchange,\nand calculates the Sharpe Ratio for each.\n\nThe user can modify the risk free rate, calculations, and any of the currencies\ncurrently being pulled.\n\n**First time install**\n\nThe tool is nice and simple to use. It requires about\n2 minutes to setup, then after that you are good to go.\n\n1.

An increase of investment property from 1 to 2 is exactly equivalent to an increase from 10 to 20 or 100 to 200, because the ROI is the same in all three cases.\n\nSecond, the Sharpe ratio that the writer cites uses standard deviation, a measure that meaningfully applies only to normal distributions.

Really unique project that has the potential to be a gold mine. It's P2P file-sharing but seeders get compensated with UFR tokens. This could completely take uTorrent/BitTorrents market cap as people will definitely want to seed files on this app and get tokens for it. I myself would use this app if successfully made, and with that low of a market cap the potential is huge here.  \n\n[RedPulse](https://coin.red-pulse.com/): ICO starts today, Whitelist is already closed (I think?). \"China\u2019s economy is already the 2nd largest in the world in terms of nominal GDP, and 1st in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). However, as a market for investment and industry participation, it remains incredibly difficult to understand. This disconnect presents a huge opportunity to platforms and services that can bridge this informational gap. The problem is made all the more challenging to solve by several critical circumstances.\"\n\n[EnjinCoin](https://EnjinCoin.io): ICO is going on now. Really big market for this type of thing, the e-Sports market and crypto will be a realistic use case in the future. I love this project and think people will actually use it, as opposed to 99% of the other projects which sound great but have no real uses. \n\n[Airswap](https://www.airswap.io): Decentralized exchange like 0x. Really cool project, will be watching this one. \n\nGrid+: ICO starts October 30. \"Grid+ leverages the Ethereum blockchain to give consumers direct access to wholesale energy markets. This decreases costs, shifts production closer to demand, and moves us all toward a cleaner energy future.\" (Backed by Consensys)\n\nSalt - Blockchain-based loans.\n\nDNT - We've already seen it at 4x this price, so it could happen again. The project itself is alright. \n\nI will actively add projects as they are suggested here. \n",

Right now I happen to find projects like Solana, Polkadex, Enjin, and the upcoming Stoic token to be interesting (though with this last one it\u2019s just because I use their app and the token allows you to unlock certain features). Though I\u2019m totally hyped with Solana right now. I know people don\u2019t think that Solana can beat Ethereum (I kind of think the same way) but it shows promise.\n\nThough honestly there is just an overwhelming amount of crypto-related projects right now and it\u2019s kind of hard to figure out which ones to invest in. I know a lot of these projects can be quite sus too, and while there are some that are good, each one still has its own issues. But in the end, no matter how much you strategize, you still need some kind of luck to get good gains in all these.",

You may remember from my last post [Top crypto picks for 2018: building a futureproof portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/7mzpea/top_crypto_picks_for_2018_building_a_futureproof). I had such an overwhelming positive response of people sending me PM's commenting how much money they made because of my post, I've decided to share my updated portfolio picks. \n\n**My methodology**\n\nSame as before. The golden rules I follow when investing keep me from chasing pumps and dumps and ensure I'm invested in solid, usable and futureproof trechnology. I think the most important rule is to not chase pump and dumps. Research every coin that you think has potential and make decisions from there.\n\nPersonally I only invest in coins with:\n\n * Solid and usable technology\n\n * Clear future use-case\n\n * Transparent researchable team\n\n * Evidence of active GitHub or code or working product\n\n * Token has value within the project (inherently part of the ecosystem)\n\nIf a coin is missing one of these characteristics, it needs to be super strong in another field to make up for it. Honestly the biggest gains I have made are the projects I researched thoroughly, believed in and then HODLed, even through all the dips.\n\n**Core picks**\n\nThese are my blue-chip shares: the projects I believe have proved themself worthy of the long hold.They will hold (relative) value through dips but still have the potential to increase exponentially with adoption. You'll notice most of them are platforms, not specific projects. Most of my reasoning behind this is because while singular projects may multiple in value, platforms will increase in value exponentialy.\n\n * **[Ethereum](http://wcibtc.com/ethereum)** - Ethereum is currently without doubt the leading smart contract and trading cryptocurrency platform.  If you've ever taken a glance over the top 300ish coins, you would be astonished by how many of them are ERC20 Ethereum based tokens. With it's fast and cheap transactions, Eth is always my go-to mode for transfering and buying crypto. \n\n * **[IOTA](http://wcibtc.com/iota)** - DAG based data-network build for machine to machine transactions where you complete proof of work for 2 other transactions before yours is processed. People also seem to forget that IOTA software is only half of the picture; The IOTA devs have been working on processor hardware that can complete proof of work at a machine level. The IOTA Foundation (non-profit) has been hiring some of the best names in crypto over the last year and they have a great number of partnerships with technology giants, including Robert Bosch Engineering RND, one of the leading chip technology developers in the world. IOTA is still a beta product, but if they keep shooting goals at the current rate their network will rival that of current blockchain infrastructure.\n\n * **[Neo](http://wcibtc.com/neo)** - Smart contract and do-it-all platform. Often refered to as chinese ethereum with good reason. NEO has a huge developer community and HongFei has tweeted recently about being in talks with the Chinese government to provide a standardised platform to stick to their regulations. Perfect vehicle for Chinese capital to flow into the crypto ecosystem.\n\n * **[Monero](http://wcibtc.com/xmr)** - The best privacy coin. As long as everyone is able to see all your transaction and wallet history, crypto will never be suitable for real-world adoption. Monero is the number one competitor in the privacy space (at the current time). Excitingly, Monero has a major update planned for March 2018, with their planned release of their BulletProofs update. This update is expected to greatly decrease both transactions times and fees while reduced the memory requirements of their software. \n\n * **[Stellar](http://wcibtc.com/xlm)** - Since my last post, I've had the oppurtunity to research Stellar is much greater details, and I have been thoroughly impressed with what I have found. Honestly, their partnership with IBM speaks more then I can shill, with IBM running many of their public nodes, showing their public backing of this project. Most exciting is FairX exchange that Stellar is launching 2018 which will offer both altcoin and fiat trading pairs. Rumoured to be a much needed direct competitor for Coinbase.\n\n * **[Request Network](http://wcibtc.com/req)** - Edited this in! Can't believe I forgot REQ. Request Network is a full suite of auditing and financial tools including payment processing and fiat to alt coin conversion. REQ is backed by tech kickstarter YCombinator. They have now released their test net running on the Ethereum Rinkeby network, and are set for mainnet release in Q1 2018. If REQ achieves it's vision, it will completely revolutionize the financial and auditing industries.\n\n * **[Factom](http://wcibtc.com/factom)** - A token which builds off other blockchains to store financial contracts and data. Multiple grants from Dept of Homeland Security and Bill & Melinda Gates foundation. Working with Linxens (one of the largest RFID and passport manufacturers in the world) on Smart Identity products. They already have multiple Fortune 100 customers that will be annouced in Q1 2018 who are already implementing their products. Factom is one of the best blockchain technology usage cases I have ever seen.\n\n**Trading picks**\n\nWhile I wouldn't consider these picks risky by my methodology, they lack the long term credibility and are probably more prone to volatile behaviour. Higher volatility means higher potential gains, but higher chance of loss. At this stage, I don't plan on really holding any of them super long term, but they may be good for some short-term gains.\n\n * **[UTrust](http://wcibtc.com/utrust)** - Payment platform system with the world's first inbuilt cryptocurrency consumer protections. Utrust has largely missed the hype that has driven REQ price in the last week and there is certainly potential for them to gain ground in the payment platform sector. \n\n * **[Lamden Tau](http://wcibtc.com/lamden)** - A suite of developer tools that speed up the process of creating new and custom blockchains and apps. I haven't had a chance to fully read up on how they plan on implementing their toolset but they have a highly professional team with set usecase and roadmap. Only available on EtherDelta currently so it's a bit of a dark horse.\n\n * **[Chainlink](http://wcibtc.com/chainlink)** - Decentralized oracles for linking real world applications with blockchain applications. I called this on my last post and it has tripled in price since. Chainlink is the next step to blockchain technology intregration and it currently has no real competitors in this space. Chainlink's potential is unbelievable. \n\n * **[Quantstamp](http://wcibtc.com/quantstamp)** - Smart Contract auditing. Token holders also receive a free airdrop of every smart contract they audit. Just like Request Network, QSP is backed by kickstart YComb giving it some of the best tech connections a company could hope for. \n\n * **[Horizon State Decision Token](http://wcibtc.com/decision-token)** - An australian startup focusing on providing a immutable polling and election results. They already have their product integrated in MiVote and are launching fully this year. This type of immutable data storage is the perfect example of the power that blockchain technology can have in real world applications, especially with such controversy surrounding recent elections. Imagine how much simpiler 2020 elections would be with this technology being used ;)\n\n * **[Modum](http://wcibtc.com/modum)** - Real time tracking for (legal) drugs in Europe. Credible team and has a working product. Modum has been one of the tokens that has a real-world usecase, but has been largely ignored mostly because (i think?) people tend to flock to the larger chinese startups like Walton & Wabi.  Modum already has existing customers and existing revenue, it can only go up with adoption.\n\n * **[Raiblocks](http://wcibtc.com/raiblocks)** - I've dropped this from a core pick to a trading pick. I love Raiblocks. I love it's free and fast transactions. But it lacks the development infrastructure. I know the dev team is working on this and I love that it has a huge future ahead of it, but I'm not ready to go all in with the recent 30x in price. I jsut think the development has a little catching up to do on the pricetag. Bright future ahead. \n\n * **[Binance Coin](http://wcibtc.com/binance-coin) / [Kucoin Shares](http://wcibtc.com/kucoin-shares)** - I'll lump these two in together because they have almost identical use-cases and purposes. Binance is now the number one altcoin exchange in the world - Their token is used to lower fees and they have been burning them to lower supply. Kucoin Shares give the holder a small percentage of every transaction fee that the exchange takes. It's honestly hard to value these kinds of coins but they both hold critical roles with-in their respective exchanges.\n\nFeel free to share in the comments your top picks for a balanced portfolio. \n\n2018 is going to be a great year for crypto!\n\n",

I think they are absolutely terrified of this possibility and that is the reason.  This question has been posted before, but the last discussion about it was over a year ago and I think it needs to be taken more seriously, as no clear answer has ever been given and no conclusions have been reached.  \n\nWhat would happen if someone uploaded illegal content to the ETH blockchain such as child pornography? Wouldn't every single ETH miner and individual with a copy of the ETH blockchain thus be committing a felony? Would this be an effective way for someone to destroy/criminalize Ethereum?\n\nI am under the impression that deleting things from the ETH blockchain would undermine its mission, has never been done, and is not currently possible without the majority of the miners agreeing to do so. How would the ETH community handle this, what would happen next?\n\nThe ETH creator's only response to this is that it would be too expensive to upload image files (UNTRUE, see my edit below), but for someone who just wanted to harm the ETH project I'm sure they would be willing to pay any price.  This is no excuse for not having a plan.  Somebody somewhere is going to do this, it's just a matter of time.  \n\n\nThe laws about this are extremely clear: \"Undeveloped film, undeveloped videotape, and **electronically stored data that can be converted into a visual image of child pornography are also deemed illegal** visual depictions under federal law.\"\n\n\nEDIT: Just did some quick math and it costs about $250 to store 45 KB on the ETH blockchain.  This is way more than enough for a clear image or even several images.  What the ETH creator said about doing this being prohibitively expensive is total bullshit.  It's not a practical way to save your photos but there are countless black hats who just enjoy ruining things for everybody else, and $250 to throw a wrench in the ETH project would be a very small price for them.  \n\nThis image is 11.5 KB and would cost $65 to store on the ETH blockchain:  https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0c/56/2b/0c562b3a3cbf007072b45d35532d7250.jpg\n",

Strictly speaking, the following is electronically stored data that can be converted to cp:\n\ni=0\nwhile True:\n    print i\n    i+=1\n\nSince the above loop will print every positive integer, and since any image can be represented as an integer, those few lines of text can be considered to be a highly compressed data archive containing all the illegal pornographic images ever produced.

            "text": "There are currently a lot of platforms, more specifically, there are 35 platforms within the Top100 only and many do very similar things. How is one supposed to know how they differ? That was the question that I asked myself.\n\nSo, I decided to compare all platforms within the Top100. I noticed that they can be put into into 5 different categories. Note: A platform is a cryptocurrency that offers smart contracts at least.\n\n1. Dapps platforms \\- 12\n2. BaaS \\- 11\n3. Liquidity \\- 2\n4. Misc \\- 7\n5. Behemoths \\-3\n\nHere are all platforms in an excel spread sheet in their categories with a description: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s8PHcNvvjuy848q18py\\_CGcu8elRGQAUIf86EYh4QZo/edit#gid=268170779](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s8PHcNvvjuy848q18py_CGcu8elRGQAUIf86EYh4QZo/edit#gid=268170779)\n\nIn order to find out which one is the best platform in each market currently and made sure to be strict with every platform and point out their flaws.\n\nLet's look at the 5 markets.\n\n# 1) Dapps platforms\n\nDapps platforms are definitely a solid bet for the next years. Besides Ethereum, Neo, EOS and Stellar are probably the most known here, however, all 4 are simply extremely centralized and would need to completely change their architecture to become more decentralized. Until that happens, none of these platform can really be considered as a platform with good technology, since everyone can achieve high scalability by letting a few hundred nodes do the consensus algorithm. There is nothing difficult about that. The difficulty is achieving several million TPS with 100,000 nodes deciding consensus.\n\nCardano, Aeternity are the only ones that seem to be able to maintain excellent decentralization with high scalability, because they scale through side\\-chains/horizontally.\n\nAll platforms considered, Ethereum seems to be on the way there as well with its change to Casper.\n\n1. Cardano has a great team, has probably the most secure PoS that was peer\\-reviewed in a scientific approach, has their mainnet launched, has near infinite scalability through sidechains and offers broad usability of Smart contracts in a number of programming languages.\n2. Ethereum is a 2nd generation blockchain that allows the use of smart contracts and dapps on a smaller scope. Ethereum currently has bad scalability, though this concern could be alleviated by the soon to be implemented Sharding concept and its new PoS/PoW consensus algorithm Casper. Still, there are platforms with much more comprehensive dapp ecosystems, and much more scalability. However, Ethereum just closed a partnership with AWS. This is probalby the biggest partnership in the cryptosphere. Though, in order to be better than any of the top 3 platforms, it would need to provide Oracles, a lot more functionality for dapps, partnerships, decentralized data storage, cloud computing.\n3. Neblio is similar to NEO and a good platform, though it has a much smaller market cap.\n4. EOS has high scalability, though is much more centralized than Skycoin, Elastos and Cardano. However, it offers a lot of functionality for Dapps. EOS is overhyped. It is on the same level as Neblio, Neo, Aeternity, but not on the same level as Skycoin, Elastos, IOTA, Cardano.\n5. NEO is a very established platform in this category.However, Neo dapps scale on\\-chain and can thus clog the network quickly. For that reason, NEO had to pick a very centralized approach to maintain scalability and it looking to rely on hand\\-picked nodes to maintain scalability in the future, very similar to EOS also very centralized approach of 121 handpicked nodes.\n6. Stellar has similar goals as Ripple, only that it is more a platform than only a currency, so it does offer more functionality. . Stellar uses Byzantine Fault Tolerance in the consensus protocol, which ensures secure consensus can be reached (moving the blockchain forward) even if a large percentage of nodes are disabled or acting dishonestly. It also helps keep nodes distributed. Stellar is a good platform with tight involvement with banks. While it doesn't have as much functionality as all above platforms, it can probably carve out its niche by doing really good business with banks.\n7. Aeternity: We\u2019ve seen recently, that it\u2019s difficult to scale the execution of smart contracts on the blockchain. Crypto Kitties is a great example. Something as simple as creating and trading unique assets on Ethereum bogged the network down when transaction volume soared. Ethereum and Zilliqa address this problem with Sharding. Aeternity focuses on increasing the scalability of smart contracts and dapps by moving smart contracts off\\-chain. Instead of running on the blockchain, smart contracts on Aeternity run in private state channels between the parties involved in the contracts. State channels are lines of communication between parties in a smart contract. They don\u2019t touch the blockchain unless they need to for adjudication or transfer of value. Because they\u2019re off\\-chain, state channel contracts can operate much more efficiently. They don\u2019t need to pay the network for every time they compute and can also operate with greater privacy. An important aspect of smart contract and dapp development is access to outside data sources. This could mean checking the weather in London, score of a football game, or price of gold. Oracles provide access to data hosted outside the blockchain. In many blockchain projects, oracles represent a security risk and potential point of failure, since they tend to be singular, centralized data streams. Aeternity proposes decentralizing oracles with their oracle machine. Doing so would make outside data immutable and unchangeable once it reaches Aeternity\u2019s blockchain. Of course, the data source could still be hacked, so Aeternity implements a prediction market where users can bet on the accuracy and honesty of incoming data from various oracles.It also uses prediction markets for various voting and verification purposes within the platform. Aeternity\u2019s network runs on on a hybrid of proof of work and proof of stake. Founded by a long\\-time crypto\\-enthusiast and early colleague of Vitalik Buterin, Yanislav Malahov.\n8. IOST: To improve speed and scalability, IOStoken uses a Proof of Believability consensus mechanism eliminating the need for an energy\\-hungry proof\\-of\\-work protocol, which stands as a barrier to blockchain scaling up for widespread adoption. With this system, a node is validated based on its past contributions and behaviors. Moreover, to increase fairness and to most fully embrace the decentralized nature of the blockchain, IOS uses a \u201cfairness\u201d algorithm that randomly distributes data to various nodes. It\u2019s intended to support service\\-oriented goods and services with large customer bases. Decentralized applications and smart contracts, the hallmarks of blockchain platforms, are a priority for IOS as well.\n9. Request Network: Req payments can be used for online purchases, business to business invoices, escrow, advanced payments and eventually IoT payments between machines. Other than payments, the Request Network is also tackling auditing and budget transparency. Businesses have the ability to track invoices to audit payments as well as record transactions for accounting purposes. Governments, nonprofits, and other organizations can also use Request to bring transparency to their budget and expenditures.\n10. Rchain: Similar to Ethereum with smart contracts, though much more scalable at an expected 40,000 TPS and possible 100,000 TPS. However, Rchain has not launched ye..\n11. Ziliqa: Zilliqa is building a new way of sharding, so that 10,000 tps are soon possible by being linearly scalable with the number of nodes. That means, the more nodes, the faster the network gets. They are looking at implementing privacy as well.Rchain is an ok platform.\n12. Ethereum classic is the original Ethereum that decided not to fork after a hack for philosophical reasons. The Ethereum that we know is its fork.\n\n# 2) BaaS (Blockchain-as-a-Service)\n\nBaaS take a different route to adoption than mere Dapps platforms. They are also dapp platforms, but focus on businesses (B2B) instead of end\\-users (B2C) within the cryptosphere. They sell their blockchain services to companies, who then can build their own customizable blockchain as a side\\-chain to the BaaS without hassle and worry about technology or blockchain architecture. This is all handled by the BaaS company already and the customer only needs to change a few variables and they have their own blockchain. Side\\-chains are interesting, because they allow virtually infinite scaling, since there can be an infinite number of side\\-chains that only communicate with the main\\-chain occasionally and handle the majority of transactions on their own chain. This is also called horizontal scaling.\n\nThe success of a BaaS platform largely depends on its ability to close partnerships to sell to large businesses and having the best usability. The more contracts they can sell to businesses and institutions, the more valuable it will be. For that reason, the BaaS with the best ability to form partnerships and do sales will win this market. Technology isn't as important here. Of course, the platform has to work without bugs, but having a platform with outstanding technology, average usability and average marketing will lose against a platform with average technology, great usability and great marketing.\n\n1. VeChain is a Singapore\\-based project that\u2019s building a business enterprise platform and inventory tracking system. . While it is not really competing with the above mentioned platforms, any of them can build supply management tools into their platform and compete with VeChain. However, VeChain has very strong partnerships. This gives them some protection of any of the above mentioned entering the market. Examples are verifying genuine luxury goods and food supply chains. VeChain has one of the strongest communities in the crypto world. If you are looking for something more high risk, high return, have a look into Ambrosus and Devery(Eve). Both also seem to be good at building partnerships, which is the most important characteristic for a supply chain platform required to succeed.\n2. Icon is called the Korean Ethereum. However, it specializes more on building customizable blockchains for banks, insurance providers, hospitals, and universities, since it's a BaaS. Icon has a focus on on ID verification and payments. Icon is ery close behind Vechain, because with Samsung and Line.\n3. WTC is a supply chain management platform, similar to Vechain, however, with fewer partnerships.\n4. Komodo\u2019s open\\-source platform is for doing transparent, anonymous, private, and fungible transactions. They are then made ultra\\-secure using Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain via a Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) protocol and decentralized crowdfunding (ICO) platform to remove middlemen from project funding. Offers services for startups to create and manage their own Blockchains. While it doesn't have as many partnerships as other BaaS, it is the only BaaS that offers privacy so far. However, that's. it such a bug competitive advantage, since it can be replicated rather swiftly.\n5. NEM: The NEM blockchain powers what they call the Smart Asset System. This system is intended to be an open, customizable blockchain solution for any number of use cases built on top of simple, powerful API calls. NEM started as a NXT fork and introduced a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Importance (PoI), designed to reward users\u2019 contribution to the XEM community. It is roughly based on proof\\-of\\-stake, but it also reflects how active a user is in transacting with other users. POW rewards powerful computers and also requires excessive amounts of energy. POS gives an unfair advantage to coin hoarders. The more coins they keep in their accounts, the more they earn, meaning that the rich get richer and everyone has an incentive to save coins instead of spending them.\n6. Ark is a fork of Lisk, which is doubling down on a smaller feature set than Lisk. Ark is a good BaaS, though it doesn't have many partnerships. Furthermore, they haven't launched their platform yet.\n7. Dragonchain: The Purpose of DragonChain is to help companies quickly and easily incorporate blockchain into their business applications. Many companies might be interested in making this transition because of the benefits associated with serving clients over a blockchain \u2013 increased efficiency and security for transactions, a reduction of costs from eliminating potential fraud and scams, etc. Dragonchain is a good BaaS, though it doesn't have many partnerships. However, it was funded by Disney, so it might be able to get partnerships more easy.\n8. LISK: Lisk's difference to other BaaS is that side chains are independent to the main chain and have to have their own nodes. Similar to neo whole allows dapps to deploy their blockchain too. Lisk is a good BaaS, though it doesn't have many partnerships. Furthermore, they haven't launched their platform yet.\n9. Stratis: Different to LISK, Stratis will allow businesses and organizations to create their own blockchain according to their own needs, but secured on the parent Stratis chain. Stratis\u2019s simple interface will allow organizations to quickly and easily deploy and/or test blockchain functionality of the Ethereum, BitShares, BitCoin, Lisk and Stratis environements.Stratis is similar to Lisk, but also doesn't have many partnerships\n10. ARDR: Ardor is a public blockchain platform that will allow people to utilize the blockchain technology of Nxt through the use of child chains. A child chain, which is a \u2018light\u2019 blockchain that can be customized to a certain extent, is designed to allow easy self\\-deploy for your own blockchain. Nxt claims that users will \"not need to worry\" about security, as that part is now handled by the main chain (Ardor). This is the chief innovation of Ardor. Ardor was evolved from NXT by the same company. NEM started as a NXT clone.\n11. Bytom: Bytom is an interactive protocol of multiple financial assets ( digital currency, digital assets warrants, securities, dividends, bonds, intelligence information, forecasting information and other information that exist in the physical world) can be registered, exchanged, gambled and engaged in other more complicated and contract\\-based interoperations via Bytom.\n\n# 3) Liquidity\n\nThere are really only 2 platforms in the Liquidity market, albeit the Liquidity market could be one of the biggest markets with insitutional investors entering the cryptoworld soon, since there is very little liquidity in Bitcoin. For example, say a pension fund wants to buy or sell $10B in Bitcoins. No single exchange has that many Bitcoins available and it would wreak havoc on the market. This wouldn't be a problem with Liquidity platforms, since they pull all order books together and back up market liquidity with FIAT money among other things.\n\n1. QASH is used to fuel its liquid platform which will be an exchange that will distribute their liquidity pool. Its product, the Worldbook is a multi\\-exchange order book that matches crypto to crypto, and crypto to fiat and the reverse across all currencies. E.g., someone is selling Bitcoin is USD on exchange1 not owned by Quoine and someone is buying Bitcoin in EURO on exchange 2 not owned by Quoine. If the forex conversions and crypto conversions match then the trade will go through and the Worldbook will match it, it'll make the sale and the purchase on either exchange and each user will get what they wanted, which means exchanges with lower liquidity if they join the Worldbook will be able to fill orders and take trade fees they otherwise would miss out on.They turned it on to test it a few months ago for an hour or so and their exchange was the top exchange in the world by 4x volume for the day because all Worldbook trades ran through it. Binance wants BNB to be used on their one exchange. Qash wants their QASH token embedded in all of their partners. More info here [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8a8lnr/which\\_are\\_your\\_top\\_5\\_favourite\\_coins\\_out\\_of\\_the/dwyjcbb/?context=3Qash](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8a8lnr/which_are_your_top_5_favourite_coins_out_of_the/dwyjcbb/?context=3Qash) is doing something completely different as the above mentioned. It offers liquidity in an illiquid market. Sell shovels during a gold rush.\n2. Loopring is similar to Qash, only that it functions as a dezentralized exchange, while QASH is more of an API without a user interface. It is a protocol that will enable higher liquidity between exchanges and personal wallets by pooling all orders sent to its network and fill these orders through the order books of multiple exchanges. When using Loopring, traders never have to deposit funds into an exchange to begin trading. Even with decentralized exchanges like Ether Delta, IDex, or Bitshares, you\u2019d have to deposit your funds onto the platform, usually via an Ethereum smart contract. But with Loopring, funds always remain in user wallets and are never locked by orders. This gives you complete autonomy over your funds while trading, allowing you to cancel, trim, or increase an order before it is executed.\n\n# 4) Misc\n\nThese are platforms that are focused on a specialized functionality\n\n1. Nebulas: Similar to how google indexes webpages Nebulas will index blockchain projects, smart contracts & data using the Nebulas rank algorithm that sifts & sorts the data. Developers rewarded NAS to develop & deploy on NAS chain. Nebulas calls this developer incentive protocol \u2013 basically rewards are issued based on how often dapp/contract etc. is used, the more the better the rewards and Proof of devotion. Works like DPoS except the best, most economically incentivised developers (Bookkeepers) get the forging spots. Ensuring brains stay with the project (Cross between PoI & PoS). 2,400 TPS\\+, DAG used to solve the inter\\-transaction dependencies in the PEE (Parallel Execution Environment) feature, first crypto Wallet that supports the Lightening Network.Nebulas is the only one doing what it's doing. This makes them very unique and a good investment.\n2. Centrality is a decentralized market place for dapps that are all connected together on a blockchain\\-powered system. Centrality aims to allow businesses to work together using blockchain technology. With Centrality, startups can collaborate through shared acquisition of customers, data, merchants, and content. That shared acquisition occurs across the Centrality blockchain, which hosts a number of decentralized apps called Scenes. Companies can use CENTRA tokens to purchase Scenes for their app, then leverage the power of the Centrality ecosystem to quickly scale. Some of Centrality's top dapps are, Skoot, a travel experience marketplace that consists of a virtual companion designed for free independent travelers and inbound visitors, Belong, a marketplace and an employee engagement platform that seems at helping business provide rewards for employees, Merge, a smart travel app that acts as a time management system, Ushare, a transports application that works across rental cars, public transport, taxi services, electric bikes and more. All of these dapps are able to communicate with each other and exchange data through Centrality. Centrality is the only one doing what it's doing. This makes them very unique and a good investment.\n3. Salt: Leveraging blockchain assets to secure cash loans. Plans to offer cash loans in traditional currencies, backed by your cryptocurrency assets. Allows lenders worldwide to skip credit checks for easier access to affordable loans.Salt is a good lending platform. However, there is also Elixir, a better investment with a 30x smaller market cap, but also strong technology. Elixir has such a low market cap, because they didn't have an ICO and they only focused on development and no marketing. As of last week, they started marketing.\n4. Aion: Today, there are hundreds of blockchains. In the coming years, those hundreds will become thousands and\u2014with ,widespread adoption by mainstream business and government\u2014millions. Blockchains don\u2019t talk to each other at all right now, they are like the PCs of the 1980s. The Aion network is able to support custom blockchain architectures while still allowing for cross\\-chain interoperability by enabling users to exchange data between any Aion\\-compliant blockchains by making use of an interchain framework that allows for messages to be relayed between blockchains in a completely trust\\-free manner.\n5. Waves is a decentralized exchange and crowdfunding platform by letting companies and projects to issue and manage their own digital coin tokens to raise money.\n6. ChainLink is a decentralized oracle service, the first of its kind. Oracles are defined as an \u2018agent\u2019 that finds and verifies real\\-world occurrences and submits this information to a blockchain to be used in smart contracts.With ChainLink, smart contract users can use the network\u2019s oracles to retrieve data from off\\-chain application program interfaces (APIs), data pools, and other resources and integrate them into the blockchain and smart contracts. Basically, ChainLink takes information that is external to blockchain applications and puts it on\\-chain. The difference to Aeternity is that Chainlink deploys the smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Chainlink's main functionality is oracles, a functionality also offered by IOTA.\n7. QTUM: Smart Contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. QTUM is a smart contracts for BTC, a very niche market. Furthermore, BTC might offer smart contracts itself soon and make QTUM obsolete. Hopefully QTUM will expand into more smart contracts functionality to become relevant again.\n\nNebulas with Indexing the Blockchain world and Salt with Lending are probably the 2 most interesting platforms here. Nebulas doesn't have a single competitor, though there are several competitors to Salt with a much smaller market cap and with similar development progress, ELIX.\n\n# 5) Behemoths\n\nThere are 3 platforms that have not been discussed yet. However, they can do most what the above platforms can do and have the potential to steal the market of all above mentioned platforms. That's why I call them behemoths.\n\n1.) Skycoin :Skycoin is building what Pied Piper is building in the series HBO's Silicon Valley, a completely decentralized internet that is not run by ISPs, but by IoT devices, making telecom providers like Comcast, ISPs who can control bandwith, cost, net neutrality, filters, access etc. obsolete and completely decentralize them. Skycoin offers what 36 coins are offering: \n\n1. 12 Scalable Currency (Bitcoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin Gold, Nano, Bitcoin Diamond, Dogecoin, Digibyte, Decred, Bitcoin Atom)\n2. 10 Smart Contract and Dapps platforms (Cardano, Ethereum, Neblio, EOS, Stellar, Neo, Rchain, IOST, Ziliqa, Eth classic)\n3. 10 BaaS (VeChain, Icon, WTC, Ontology, Komodo, NEM, Ark, Dragonchain, LISK, Stratis).\n4. 4 Decentralized Storage (Siacoin, Maidsafe, Gybte, Storj)\n\nIf you think that the decentralized Internet will blow all other markets out of the water and will be the biggest invention of this decade, then Skycoin is your pick, because covers that and what 27 coins do.\n\n2.) IOTA: With the launch of Q 1 week ago, IOTA is about to offer what 27 platforms within the Top 100 are offering (!) and they are probably looking to replace several more.\n\n1. 12 Scalable Currency (Bitcoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin Gold, Nano, Bitcoin Diamond, Dogecoin, Digibyte, Decred, Bitcoin Atom.)\n2. 10 Smart Contract and Dapps platforms (Cardano, Ethereum, Neblio, EOS, Stellar, Neo, Rchain, IOST, Ziliqa, Eth classic)\n3. 2 Oracles (Aeternity, ChainLink)\n4. 3 Outsourced Cloud Computing (DBC, Aelf, Golem)\n\nIOTA is at the same level as Skycoin and Elastos. However, SKY's flagship product is the Decentralized Internet and ELA's is the most comprehensive dapps operating system in the cryptosphere, which IOTA cannot really replicate in the near future, because it takes years of reseach and development. This protects ELA and SKY from IOTA for now. \n\nHowever, it looks like IOTA can snatch up all the smaller, easier to replicate markets, such as cloud computing, oracles, smart contracts, decentralized storage, currency exchange and soon possibly also supply chain management, BaaS functionality, privacy, security identification since none of those are really hard to build. However, Skycoin and Elastos will probably focus on their flagships and leave IOTA to scoop up all the rest. It will be an interesting year.\n\n3.) Elastos started out as a mobile operating system 18 years ago and has now moved towards a smart contracts platform, operating system and a runtime environment for Dapps. Thanks to side\\-chains they are near infinitely scalable and is thus also very decentralized. Elastos is offering what 36 coins are offering\n\n1. 12 Scalable Currency (Bitcoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin Gold, Nano, Bitcoin Diamond, Dogecoin, Digibyte, Decred, Bitcoin Atom.)\n2. 10 Smart Contract and Dapps platforms (Cardano, Ethereum, Neblio, EOS, Stellar, Neo, Rchain, IOST, Ziliqa, Eth classic)\n3. 10 BaaS (VeChain, Icon, WTC, Ontology, Komodo, NEM, Ark, Dragonchain, LISK, Stratis).\n4. 4 Decentralized Storage (Siacoin, Maidsafe, Gybte, Storj)\n\nIf you are very convinced that BaaS solutions and dapps platforms will be the big winners for 2018, then Elastos is your pick as far as I can see, because it is probably the best BaaS and dapps platform with near infinite scalability and the best decentralization and thus does what 32 coins do.\n\n3 Closing Questions\n\nAll of the above findings leave me with those 3 questions. What are your thoughts?\n\n1. Why invest in any of Dapps platforms (Cardano, Neblio, EOS, Stellar, Neo, Aeternity, Rchain, IOST, Ziliqa, Ethereum, Eth classic) when Elastos and Skycoin do everything they do, are much more decentralized and scalable through side\\-chain/off\\-chain/horizontal scaling and offer lots more functionality beyond that?\n2. Why invest in any BaaS (Ontology, Komodo, NEM, Ark ,Dragonchain, LISK, Stratis, ARDR) if ICX and VeChain offer everything what all of the above offer and already have 10x more partnerships than their competitors?\n3. It looks like out of all 35 platforms, only 5 are really strong: IOTA, Skycoin, Elastos, VeChain, ICX. While the first 3 seem to cover already almost half of the top 100, the last 2 really convince in the partnership department. What's the argument for investing in any of the 30 other platforms? Maybe that they can specialise on a specific feature set, however, is this really a convincing argument? The cryptoworld is harsh and if you can't keep up with competition, you'll be moved out of the market quickly.",

                    "response": "Maidsafe - SAFE Network (decentralised internet, not just a storage coin like mentioned above)(Scalable, instant & private transactions, new consensus mechanism invented by them called PARSEC, big experienced team, 10+ year project, smart contacts, censorship resistant internet, DDOS resilient, private, secure, no blockchain, sharding solved, more efficient using less energy, no servers, autonomous network, Silicon Valley HBO advisors):\n\nI won't lie, I am a huge following of this project and after being interested and involved in Bitcoin, etc since early 2013, there hasn't been a project I've been as excited about than this one. Not only do the goals of the project seem so grand and huge, I have grown a massive amount of respect for the honesty, professionalism and technical expertise of David Irvine and his team, but also of many of the members on their main forum: https://safenetforum.org/ \n\nAs a software engineer myself, but in a different field, I can really appreciate how complex this project is and how hard it is to deliver with confidence that there won't be problems. These guys are reinventing the wheel with trying to truly decentralize the internet and giving us back control of our data, privacy, security as well as creating an amazing ecosystem that should bring in thousands if not millions of developers and content creators over time. \n \nThe community is so good, that some of them understand the code that well that they often answer questions on the forum just as well as the actually Maidsafe team can and have also written an excellent Safe Network Primer: https://www.safenetworkprimer.com/\n\nNot to mention in the past the community have run their own test nets and found bugs. For me, this kind of community with a deep understanding of the tech with a passion for the project and working hard to develop on top of the platform is a key indicator of a very good project that has a massive potential for success. \n\nThis project has been going on for over ten years (pre Bitcoin) and is so complex that when it finally arrives it will really turn some heads, with the fact it doesn't use a blockchain, so will solve the scaling issue, and that it is going to have instant use cases, with many apps and websites already created before we even hit full launch. \n\nAlso recently announced at the SAFE DevCon 2018 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DKjsJxVdfg , Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the world wide web, has shown an interest in the project and there has been some development work done by one of the excellent community members to show how Tim Berners-Lee's project called Solid can use the help of the Safe Network to achieve some of it's goals: https://safenetforum.org/t/devcon-talk-supercharging-the-safe-network-with-project-solid/23081   \n\nIf you don't know about this project, I strongly advise to do your research on it, as you will not find many projects with such a huge goal, plus amazing team and awesome community. Even people that have heard about this project usually dismiss it because it has either been going on too long (without understanding the complexity of the goals) or they think it is just another storage platform like Siacoin or Storj, but it is so much more than that. \n\nThere is a running test network at the moment called Alpha 2, which has a number of apps and websites on it. \n\nThe other shout out to Maidsafe to mention is that the recent series Silicon Valley based their decentralized internet on Maidsafe's project(not Skycoin like some think) and actually employed the three main members from Maidsafe to advise them technically. Here is a post from Maidsafe about it:\n\nhttps://safenetforum.org/t/silicon-valley-tv-and-maidsafe-all-is-revealed/22541\n\nRecently we had huge news of a new consensus mechanism they've designed and named PARSEC. It is supposed to be scalable, quicker and more efficient than a blockchain and will apparently help most of the DAG projects like IOTA that still rely on a central control. Here is the update from the forum when they released the news:\n\nhttps://safenetforum.org/t/maidsafe-dev-update-may-24-2018-introducing-parsec/23647\n\nAnd here is one of the number of media articles written about it:\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2018/06/02/not-just-another-decentralized-web-whitepaper/\n\nCheck it out and the forum. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised :)\n\n\nGreat work on the list by the way. Although I don't agree with all, it is a nice read and appreciate the big effort. \n\n\n\n\n",

However, how does it comapre to IOTA? Don't get me wrong, I used to be a big nano fan, instant transactions, zero fees, 1 million the energy usage of Bitcoin, but then I found IOTA, which does all that and many more things.

After using both, I personally found iota more difficult to use. It has problems involving the coordinator, only one time addresses, and the encryption protocal is custom not off the shelf. Also, last time I sent a transaction with iota it took much longer than anticipated. The smart contracts are cool, but for what nano is doing I don't think they're necesarry.",

This summer, there is going to be alot of bitter folks that wish they never logged into their accounts on Feb 1 2018. Countries around the world are not banning crypto.  They are simply cleaning things up and gearing up for full blown legal crypto.  Sure, there will be new rules but crypto is here to stay.  If tomorrow marked the final day of cryptocurrency history, I could understand the panic and the selling.  However, do you think the Canadian gov't would be using Ethereum for record keeping if crypto was in trouble?  Would IBM be partnering with Stellar if crypto was doomed?  Would Microsoft be sponsoring NEO dev competitions if crypto was ending?  Would Samsung be pouring big money into building and selling cryptocurrency mining chips if Crypto was truly in trouble?  Politicians are pumping the breaks until they figure out how to cash in.  They did they same thing with daily fantasy sports, online poker, gambling, and cannabis.  In 2015, Daily Fantasy Sports was legal in 45 states.  In 2016, it was legal in only 10 states because politicians wanted to shut it down until they figured out how to make money off it for themselves.  Today, DFS is legal in 41 states.  That's right, from an unregulated 45 (2015), cracked down to 10 (2016), and now that politicians can make money off the regulated industry, it's legal in 41.  Folks, crypto is going through the growing pains of becoming a full blown accepted industry. Check out online poker...\n\n- 1995: The first online poker websites appear.  Everyone made money except governments.\n\n- 1999:  Republican from Virginia, Robert Goodlatte, tried to shut it down with a new law.  People panicked and cashed out.  His law never passed.  It was defeated.\n\n- 2003:  Thanks to pressure from the Justice Department, most banks blocked customers from sending money to poker sites\n\n- 2005:  The world's largest online poker site (PartyGaming) went live on the London Stock exchange the same year that a Republican from Iowa tried to ban credit card payments on gambling sites.  His bill never reached the Senate floor.\n\n- 2006:  Goodlatte is back again.  Tries to ban online poker/gambling.  He is defeated again.\n\n- 2006:  President Bush signs the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, banning the transfer of money to gambling sites.  Everyone cashes out.\n\nToday:  New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware have legalized it.  People in every state freely use offshore sites.  Banks are no longer blocking payments.\n\nWhether it's online poker, cannabis, daily fantasy sports, or cryptocurrency, the people vote with their wallets.  Sure, governments always get involved so they can make a buck too (if it was about our safety, health, and well being then guns would be outlawed).  Hold your coins if you haven't sold.  Buy coins this weekend at a massive discount.  Embrace the future.  Expect dips along the way.  We are riding a climate change graph that continually trends up.  So what if there is a record cold winter here or there.  The zig-zagging line is trending up from year to year.  Hold and/or buy.  You will have major profits should you choose to sell this summer, fall, or in 2019.  Keep your eye on the prize, stay off reddit, stay away from \"news\", and trust your instincts when you realized months or years ago that this was an unstoppable revolution: the future.\n",

Ethereum costs the same as it did on Jan 2.\n\nOne thing you're forgetting is that a massive amount of people in crypto now are new and have no sense of perspective. To them Bitcoin going down to 8K puts them at a big loss. Imagine all those people who put in their vacation fund money into Bitcoin when it was at 17K or into Tron at $0.25. \n\nI remember at beginning of 2017 I thought that if we're lucky we may hit 10K by 2020.",

That\u2019s it. Calling most of them a company would be a huge overstatement too.\n\nNot investing in XRP because \u201ccompanies won\u2019t use the token\u201d is so naive that it causes me physical pain to read.\n\nAgain, you\u2019re betting on potential.\n\nHow could you possibly think a group of random teenagers with no social or business skills and experience creating yet another ERC20 token that has no use has more potential than XRP? A US based company with an amazing team and investors and partners that go far beyond most blockchain companies will probably ever work with?\n\nLike I\u2019ve said, I understand why you\u2019d rather bet on Ethereum, Bitcoin even and a few others here and there.\n\nBut honestly stop acting like a damn parrot. The only reason you\u2019re constantly repeating the \u201cThEy WoNt UsE XRP!!!\u201d argument is because you\u2019ve seen someone else say it and you want to come across as knowledgeable.\n\nChances are you\u2019ve read that, accepted it as the absolute truth and left it there without doing even a shred of further research. Yet fall for the constant shilling of random coins every single day, driving you insane.\n\nThe whole crypto space is in its infancy stage but Ripple is laying a solid ground for an amazing future. They\u2019re among a handful of others, tops. If you\u2019re in 10-15+ coins you\u2019re going to go home disappointed, because the hits most of your \u201cinvestments\u201d took will shatter any profit you\u2019ve made from the minority of your portfolio.\n\nIf you actually care about arguments for investing in XRP and genuinely want to make money with your investments instead of your gambling based on short term satisfaction, read articles like the ones below:\n\nhttps://xrphodor.wordpress.com/2017/11/01/who-do-you-trust-with-your-money/\n\nhttps://xrphodor.wordpress.com/2017/11/07/xrp-the-digital-asset-for-banks/",

At it's current price of $0.23 the market cap for total supply would be 23 billion dollars. With that easy math we can understand easily that ripple being worth $1.00 would put its market cap at 100 billion - which is above BTC and isn't happening any time soon.. even 50 cents or a 50 billion marketcap (which would only be a doubling in value) is pretty ridiculous and would value itself above ethereum.",

This is all speculative but if banks adopt XRP protocol and do move into using XRP then it\u2019s not just thinking of it as a cryptocurrency for the public but how major banks transfer extremely large sums of money... if that does happen the market caps we are talking about are trivial especially if they can use it as a way to hold off purely \u201ccurrency \u201c coins from taking banks out. Disclaimer for the trolls- all of this depends on IF it does happen. Which I\ufe0f think is why you should contemplate at least getting some",

You have the lovers and haters of it. The lovers have already bought in, the haters Won't buy in. The few who are in between might if it starts to rise.

It looks to me like the market is not taking this supply issue into account with the current price ($0.22 today).\n\nIn the near future (6mo -- 3 yrs) you're going to see a lot of institutions struggling to buy into crypto. A fuckton of enterprise money is going to be invested in large chunks all over the place. Banks see the writing on the wall, and need to hedge their bets to find alternate value stores (besides securities, gold, commodities, and fiat currency)\n\nBTC is very scarce. Truly, there's not a lot of trade-able or salable BTC. Maybe 100,000 -- the rest are in cold storage, in deep hard hands (hodlers), or lost. If you're an institutional investor, Bitcoin looks solid. Demand is high and will grow. Supply is low. This is why I believe the hyper-monetization of Bitcoin will continue for a while.\n\nXRP on the other hand is as available as Ripple wants it to be. Sure, its going to release (sell) it in such a way to cultivate the company and the platform, but that doesn't necessarily mean the value will continue to go up. Ripple's interests may not align with yours (assuming you want XRP to just go up in value). Comparatively speaking, I don't see how supply and demand compare to Bitcoin or even Ethereum.\n\nNot to knock the company or its technology. Ripple is awesome and is here to stay. The token however -- i took a hard look at it but am putting my money elsewhere for now.",

No so much have to go right before this could be a winner.\n\nAccording to their website the games code is finished and the ICO is basically for collecting the prize money for the jackpot that the game is going to hand out. As soon the ICO (and jackpot is collected) the game will start and you should see returns already there.\n\nWhat I like about the ICO project:\n\n-\tThe game is finish\n-\tFully transparent game rules and smart contracts\n-\tJackpot can not be touched by owners\n-\tAs soon ICO stage is over, you are in green\n\nNegative/risks:\n\n-\tGame is controversial (could also means it will get talked about a lot)\n-\tNeeds players that want to gamble for the jackpot\n\nICO token is called JACK, one JACK is currently 0.005 ETH after ICO stage it will quickly multiply as the game progresses, and this is build-in as a mechanism in the game so won\u2019t be changed.\n\nhttps://etherjack.io/\n\n*As always every investment have risk\u2019s, so do your own research before investing!*\n\n\nOver the next few days I will post more coins and maybe another ICO if I find anything good. It's all about being ahead of the curve. \n",

            "text": "This is a piece to do a quick overview of decentralised exchanges and a quick comparison for newcomers and old timers alike.\n\nAs you may already know, the first generation decentralised exchanges are\n\n* **expensive to trade**\n* **slow**\n* **limited to assets within one blockchain**\n* **spot only**\n\nIt's also prone to errors and fat fingers. These include the old idex, etherdelta, and uniswap. These were unsurmountable obstacles at that time, as such, centralised exchanges flourished.\n\nHowever, I believe it's finally time for decentralised exchanges to shine. In Jan 2021 alone, [aggregate volumes hit 55.8B usd](https://www.coindesk.com/decentralized-exchange-january-2021-volumes-record). This was unthinkable just a year ago. Decentralised exchanges are finally able to solve all of these issues by\n\n1. Settling trades in Layer-2 (L2) - greatly lowering fees and increasing speed\n2. Being multi-chain - greatly increasing the amount of pairs you can trade\n3. Introducing derivatives - allowing you to YOLO and leverage your life savings\n\nThis brings it to parity (somewhat) with centralised exchanges. I regard these 3 to be essential functions.\n\nThis article will give a quick introduction to some of these projects and compare them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Comparison of DEXes](https://preview.redd.it/yld62j8krmk61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e2503d69310e3f242307dc7f52813d124fa702c)\n\n**Group 1: Dexes that only have 1 out of the 3 essential functions**\n\nThis includes MCDEX, Futureswap, DerivaDex, Kwenta, dFuture, DeversiFi, Zkswap and so on. These are Dexes that have tried to solve some of the issues but lack other essential functions\n\n**Group 2: Dexes that have 2 out of the 3 essential functions**\n\nThese are very promising projects which have achieved a lot in this space like Synthetix, dYdX, Perp, Loopring, Waves, IDEX and have a strong team. However, at this point in time, they need one more essential function.\n\n**Group 3: Dexes that have 3 out of the 3 essential functions**\n\nNow this is what I'm talking about. Let's explore each of them briefly below. You can search them up to read more.\n\n**1. Serum**\n\nSerum is built on Solana which has extremely fast block times (400ms) and very low transaction costs. It is able to interpolate between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Currently it's live and users are able to swap tokens with margin trading coming soon. Raydium has also launched as one of the first few tokens on SOL and users are able to get it there.\n\nThe SRM token is a governance token and 80% of the DEX fees goes to SRM buy and burns. SRM can also be staked to give SRM holders 50% discount on trading.\n\nSerum's backers include FTX, Alameda Research, Multicoin Capital, 3commas and more.\n\nWebsite: [https://projectserum.com/](https://projectserum.com/)\n\n2. Injective Protocol\n\nInjective is a layer-2 decentralised sidechain relayer network that is core tendermint-based. It's fully permissionless, allowing anyone to trade anything. It will offer It is able to communicate with other blockchains with Cosmos. It has formed several partnerships with Elrond, AVAx, Marlin Protocol, Ocean Protocol, HuobiECOchain and Covalent.\n\nThe INJ token is also a goverance token that users can also stake to earn rewards. Details are not out yet.\n\nCurrently, it's on testnet, with mainnet planned for Q1 2021.\n\nInjective is backed by Binance Labs, Pantera, Hashed, QCP Capital, 3commas and more.\n\nWebsite: [https://injectiveprotocol.com/](https://injectiveprotocol.com/)\n\n3. Demex\n\nDemex is also a core tendermint-based L2-Dex that will be able to offer multichain support between NEO, ETH, BSC and ZIL tokens. The tendermint-based consensus algorithm is able to reach 10,000 tps and it will be launching the world's first decentralised futures with 150x leverage.\n\nThe SWTH token is an essential part of the ecosystem and holders are able to participate in governance, stake to receive rewards. Stakers also receive all of the fees from the exchange, or can use it to mint CDPS for stablecoins(coming soon).\n\nDemex is backed by Neo Global Capital, Neo Eco Fund, Zilliqa, Defiance Capital, Three Arrows Capital, Digital Assets Capital Management, DeFi Capital and MXC Exchange.\n\nWebsite: [https://dem.exchange/](https://dem.exchange/)\n\nAs you can see, these are the three top decentralised exchanges that will rock 2021. Each of them are different and focus on different markets with different audiences.\n\nWhat are your picks? Share them below.\n\nDisclaimer: All projects are great projects. I probably hold a bit of everything in here. This is not financial advice. Also all information is to the best of my knowledge.",

I agree with you that now is the time for DEXes to step forward and shine.\n\nI need to do some research on Serum.  It sounds interesting, but the main DEX that I am following at the moment is Demex which runs on Switcheo TradeHub.  Futures were soft launched yesterday, so there will be some ramp up time as the team adds market makers, but things are exciting, especially with a current market cap of less than $40m while staking SWTH is paying 55%+ apr.\n\nInjective looks to be another interesting project, but its market cap is already up to about 250m, and it's still in the testnet phase.  I'll be keeping my eye on it though and hope they deliver.\n\nThe time is ripe for DEXes to step forward, and there will be more than one winner.  I expect these 3 to have an early leg on the competition and should do well.  At this point, I'm leaning towards Demex.  DYOR",

If you just heard about NEO a few weeks ago it would be impossible catch up on past occurrences due to high volume of Reddit posts and articles made on the project. I\u2019m going to try and simplify the past, present and future as much as I can into one well thought-out post. I hope I can be helpful to anyone who has been investigating like myself. I will include sources with all of my research.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/NBI7S (img for mobile backround)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Key notes from the White Paper** http://docs.neo.org/en-us/\n\n\n\n**Digital Assets**\n\nDigital assets are programmable assets that exist in the form of electronic data. With blockchain technology, the digitization of assets can be decentralized, trustful, traceable, highly transparent, and free of intermediaries. \nOn the NEO blockchain, users are able to register, trade, and circulate multiple types of assets. Proving the connection between digital and physical assets is possible through digital identity. \nAssets registered through a validated digital identity are protected by law.\n\n\n\n**Digital Identity**\n\nDigital identity refers to the identity information of individuals, organizations, and other entities that exist in electronic form. \nThe more mature digital identity system is based on the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) X.509 standard. \nIn NEO, we will implement a set of X.509 compatible digital identity standards. \nThis set of digital identity standards, in addition to compatible X.509 level certificate issuance model, will also support Web Of Trust point-to-point certificate issuance model. \nOur verification of identity when issuing or using digital identities includes the use of facial features, fingerprint, voice, SMS and other multi-factor authentication methods. \n\n\n\n**Smart Contracts**\n\nThe NeoContract smart contract system is the biggest feature of the seamless integration of the existing developer ecosystem. \nDevelopers do not need to learn a new programming language but use C#, Java and other mainstream programming languages in their familiar IDE environments (Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.) for smart contract development, debugging and compilation. \nNEO's Universal Lightweight Virtual Machine, NeoVM, has the advantages of high certainty, high concurrency, and high scalability. \nThe NeoContract smart contract system will allow millions of developers around the world to quickly carry out the development of smart contracts. \n\n\n\n**Economic Model**\n\nNEO has two native tokens, NEOand NeoGas\nNEO represents the right to manage the network. Management rights include voting for bookkeeping, NEO network parameter changes, and so on. The minimum unit of NEO is 1 and tokens cannot be subdivided.\nGAS is the fuel token for the realization of NEO network resource control. The NEO network charges for the operation and storage of tokens and smart contracts, thereby creating economic incentives for bookkeepers and preventing the abuse of resources. The minimum unit of GAS is 0.00000001.\n\n\n\n**Distribution Mechanism**\n\nNEO's 100 million tokens are divided into two portions. \nThe first portion is 50 million tokens distributed proportionally to supporters of NEO during the crowdfunding. \nThis portion has been distributed.\n\n\nThe second portion is 50 million NEO managed by the NEO Council to support NEO's long-term development, operation and maintenance and ecosystem. \nThe NEO in this portion has a lockout period of 1 year and is unlocked only after October 16, 2017. \nThis portion **WILL NOT enter the exchanges** and is only for long-term support of NEO projects. The plans for it are as below:\n\n\n\u25aa 10 million tokens (10% total) will be used to motivate NEO developers and members of the NEO Council\n\n\u25aa 10 million tokens (10% total) will be used to motivate developers in the NEO ecosystem\n\n\u25aa 15 million tokens (15% total) will be used to cross-invest in other block-chain projects, which are owned by the NEO Council and are used only for NEO projects\n\n\u25aa 15 million (15% total) will be retained as contingency\n\n\u25aa The annual use of NEO in principle **shall NOT exceed** 15 million tokens\n\n\n\n**GAS distribution**\n\nGAS is generated with each new block. \nThe initial total amount of GAS is zero. \nWith the increasing rate of new block generation, the total limit of 100 million GAS will be achieved in about 22 years. \nThe interval between each block is about 15-20 seconds, and 2 million blocks are generated in about one year.\nAccording to this release curve, 16% of the GAS will be created in the first year, 52% of the GAS will be created in the first four years, and 80% of the GAS will be created in the first 12 years. \nGAS will be distributed proportionally in accordance with the NEO holding ratio, recorded in the corresponding addresses. \nNEO holders can initiate a claim transaction at any time and claim these GAS tokens at their holding addresses.\n\n\n\n**Consensus mechanism: dBFT**\n\nThe dBFT is called the Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerant, a Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus mechanism that enables large-scale participation in consensus through proxy voting. \nThe holder of the NEO token can, by voting, pick the bookkeeper it supports. The selected group of bookkeepers, through BFT algorithm, reach a consensus and generate new blocks. \nVoting in the NEO network continues in real time, rather than in accordance with a fixed term.\n\n\n\n**Cross-chain assets exchange agreement**\n\nNeoX has been extended on existing double-stranded atomic assets exchange protocols to allow multiple participants to exchange assets across different chains and to ensure that all steps in the entire transaction process succeed or fail together. \nIn order to achieve this function, we need to use NeoContract function to create a contract account for each participant. \nIf other blockchains are not compatible with NeoContract, they can be compatible with NeoX as long as they can provide simple smart contract functionality.\n\n\n\n**Cross-chain distributed transaction protocol**\n\nCross-chain distributed transactions mean that multiple steps of a transaction are scattered across different blockchains and that the consistency of the entire transaction is ensured. \nThis is an extension of cross-chain assets exchange, extending the behavior of assets exchange into arbitrary behavior. \nIn layman's terms, NeoX makes it possible for cross-chain smart contracts where a smart contract can perform different parts on multiple chains, either succeeding or reverting as a whole. \nThis gives excellent possibilities for cross-chain collaborations and we are exploring cross-chain smart contract application scenarios.\n\n\n\n**Distributed Storage Protocol: NeoFS**\n\nNeoFS is a distributed storage protocol that utilizes Distributed Hash Table technology. \nNeoFS indexes the data through file content (Hash) rather than file path (URI). \nLarge files will be divided into fixed-size data blocks that are distributed and stored in many different nodes\n\n\n\n**Anti-quantum cryptography mechanism: NeoQS**\n\nThe emergence of quantum computers poses a major challenge to RSA and ECC-based cryptographic mechanisms. \nQuantum computers can solve the large number of decomposition problems (which RSA relies on) and the elliptic curve discrete logarithm (which ECC relies on) in a very short time. \nNeoQS (Quantum Safe) is a lattice-based cryptographic mechanism. \nAt present, quantum computers do not have the ability to quickly solve the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and the Closest Vector Problem (CVP), which is considered to be the most reliable algorithm for resisting quantum computers.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Reasons for choosing dBFT over PoW and PoS:**\n\nWith the phenomenal success of Bitcoin and its increasing mainstream adoption, the project\u2019s unbounded appetite for energy grew accordingly. Today, the average Bitcoin transaction costs as much energy as powering 3.67 average American homes, which amounts to about 3000 times more than a comparable Credit Card settlement.\n\n\nThis mind boggling amount of energy is not, as it is commonly believed, being wasted. It is put to good use: securing the Bitcoin network and rendering attacks on it infeasible. However, the cost of this security mechanism and its implications for an increasingly warming and resource hungry planet led almost the entire crypto industry to the understanding that an alternative has to be found, at least if we\u2019re interested in seeing blockchain technology gaining overwhelming mainstream adoption.\n\n\nThe most popular alternative to PoW, used by most alternative cryptocurrency systems, is called Proof-of-Stake, or PoS. PoS is highly promising in the sense that it doesn\u2019t require blockchain nodes to perform arduous, and otherwise useless, cryptographic tasks in order to render potential attacks costly and infeasible. Hence, this algorithm cuts the power requirements of PoS blockchains down to sane and manageable amounts, allowing them to be more scalable without guzzling up the planet's energy reserves.\n\n\nAs the name suggests, instead of requiring proof of cryptographic work, PoS requires blockchain nodes to proof stake in the currency itself. This means that in order for a blockchain node to be eligible for a verification reward, the node has to hold a certain amount of currency in the wallet associated with it. This way, in order to execute an attack, a malevolent node would have to acquire the majority of the existing coin supply, rendering attacks not only costly but also meaningless, since the attackers would primarily harm themselves.\n\n\nPoS, as well as PoW, simply cause the blockchain to fork into two alternative versions if for some reason consensus breaks. In fact, most blockchains fork most of the time, only to converge back to a single source of truth a short while afterwards.\n\n\nBy many crypto enthusiasts, this obvious bug is very often regarded as a feature, allowing several versions of the truth to survive and compete for public adoption until a resolution is generated. This sounds nice in theory, but if we want to see blockchain technology seriously disrupt and/or augment the financial sector, this ever lurking possibility of the blockchain splitting into two alternative versions cannot be tolerated.\n\n\nFurthermore, even the fastest PoS blockchains out there can accomodate a few hundred transactions per second, compare that to Visa\u2019s 56,000 tx/s and the need for an alternative becomes clear as day.\n\n\n\nA blockchain securing global stock markets does not have the privilege to fork into two alternative versions and just sit and wait it out until the market (or what\u2019s left of it) declares a winner. What belongs to whom should be engraved in an immutable record, functioning as a single source of truth with no glitches permitted.\n\n\nAfter investigating and studying the crypto industry and blockchain technologies for several years, we came to the conclusion that the delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance alternative (or dBFT) is best suited for such a system. It provides swift transaction verification times, de-incentivises most attack vectors and upholds a single blockchain version with no risk of forks or alternative blockchain records emerging - regardless of how much computing power, or coins an attacker possesses.\n\n\n\nThe term Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) derives its name from the Byzantine Generals problem in Game Theory and Computer Science, describing the problematic nature of achieving consensus in a distributed system with suboptimal communication between agents which do not necessarily trust each other.\n\n\nThe BFT algorithm arranges the relationship between blockchain nodes in such a way that the network becomes as good as resilient to the Byzantine Generals problem, and allows the system to remain consensus even if some nodes bare malicious intentions or simply malfunction.\n\n\nTo achieve this, Antshare\u2019s version of the delegated BFT (or dBFT) algorithm acknowledges two kinds of players in the blockchain space: professional node operators, called bookkeeping nodes, who run nodes as a source of income, and users who are interested in accessing blockchain advantages. Theoretically, this differentiation does not exist in PoW and most PoS environments, practically, however, most Bitcoin users do not operate miners, which are mostly located in specialized venues run by professionals. At Antshares we understand the importance of this naturally occurring division of labor and use it to provide better security for our blockchain platform.\n\n\nAccordingly, block verification is achieved through a consensus game held between specialized bookkeeping nodes, which are appointed by ordinary nodes through a form of delegated voting process. In every verification round one of the bookkeeping nodes is pseudo-randomly appointed to broadcast its version of the blockchain to the rest of the network. If \u2154 of the remaining nodes agree with this version, consensus is secured and the blockchain marches on. If less than \u2154 of the network agrees, a different node is appointed to broadcast its version of the truth to the rest of the system, and so forth until consensus is established.\n\n\nIn this way, successful system attacks are almost impossible to execute unless the overwhelming majority of the network is interested in committing financial suicide. Additionally, the system is fork proof, and at every given moment only one version of the truth exists. Without complicated cryptographic puzzles to solve, nodes operate much faster and are able to compete with centralized transaction methods.\n\nhttps://www.econotimes.com/Blockchain-project-Antshares-explains-reasons-for-choosing-dBFT-over-PoW-and-PoS-659275\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**OnChain**\n\nIt is important to note the technical difference between Onchain and NEO. Onchain is a private VC-backed company with over 40 employees. NEO is a public platform with different community-led groups contributing to this public project. There exists NEO council comprised of the original NEO creators, employees from Onchain, full time NEO council members and there is also the first Western based group called City of Zion. This confusion is likely the source of the rumour about Antshares and Alibaba having a connection. Onchain and NEO are separate entities who are intimately related via cross-chain communications and similar designs.\n\n\nOnchain, a Shanghai-based blockchain R&D company, first started developing Antshares in February of 2014 which will eventually become the foundation of DNA. Onchain was founded by CEO Da HongFei and CTO Erik Zhang in response to the attention from private companies garnered by the development of Antshares, China\u2019s first public blockchain. In contrast to the weeks-old start-ups launching ICOs that is happening currently in the blockchain world, it took them 22 long months of R&D to even begin providing services to their first customers. Finally, in April 2016, the first whitepaper on consensus protocol from China was born \u2014 the dBFT (delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance) protocol.\n\n\n\n2016 was a busy year for Onchain and they really picked up the pace that year. Other than continuing the development of Antshares, brushing shoulders with Fortune 500 companies, Onchain became the first Chinese blockchain company to join Hyperledger \u2014 an open source blockchain project started by the Linux Foundation specifically focusing on the development of private and consortium chains for businesses. It is here where the Da HongFei and Erik Zhang, entered the hyperbolic time chamber that is now known as Fabric, a platform by Hyperledger for distributed ledger solutions, and has consequently helped them to develop many aspects underpinning the design of DNA.\n\n\n\nIn June of 2016, during the first of many future partnerships with Microsoft China, Onchain founded Legal Chain specifically targeting the inadequacies of the digital applications within the legal system. In 2005, (Digital Signature Act) was passed into national law which permitted an effective digital signatures to gain the same legal rights as a real signature. \n\n\n\nIn company with Microsoft China, they are also aiming to integrate the technology with Microsoft\u2019s face and voice recognition API function to kick start this digital revolution within the legal system. At the same time, a partnership was formed with FaDaDa, a third-party platform for electronic contracts that has processed over 27 million contracts to date, to provide secure evidence storage with DNA. If that\u2019s not enough, they were also voted as KPMG\u2019s top 50 Fintech Company in China and established a relationship with the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry which led to the recent tour to Japan. Finally, at the end of 2016 they announced a partnership with Alibaba to provide attested email service for Ali Cloud with Legal Chain where it provides a proof-of-existence for a blockchain-powered email evidence repository for enterprise-level use.\n\n\nFosun Group, China\u2019s largest private conglomerate, have recently invested into Onchain in order to apply DNA across all of its businesses. Currently, Fosun International has a market cap of 102.98 billion dollars on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and that is only its international branch.\n\n\nThe role of Onchain so far is reminiscent of Ethereum\u2019s EEA in addition to a stronger emphasis of governmental cooperation. Onchain has identified the shortcomings of present laser focus of hype on public platforms such as NEO and Ethereum and addressing that with DNA. DNA envisions a future where a network of assorted, specifically designed blockchains serving private enterprises, consortiums, government and the public communicating with each other forming an interconnected blockchain network.\n\n\nThis is the goal of DNA \u2014 infiltrating every little inefficient niche that had no better alternatives before the invention of blockchain. What is especially critical to remember during this explosive time of hype driven partly by the obscene degree of greed is that not every little niche that blockchain can fill will be holding its own little ICO for you to \u201cgo to the moon on your rocket powered lambos\u201d. Some of those efficiencies gained will simply be consumed by companies privately or by public systems such as the legal system.\n\n\nhttps://hackernoon.com/neo-onchain-and-its-ultimate-plan-dna-4c33e9b6bfaa\n\nhttp://www.onchain.com/\n\nhttps://github.com/DNAProject/DNA\n\nhttps://siliconangle.com/blog/2016/10/20/onchain-partners-with-alibaba-for-blockchain-powered-email-evidence-repository/\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-fosun-blockchain/chinas-fosun-invests-in-local-version-of-bitcoin-tech-blockchain-idUSKCN1B30KM\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**City of Zion (CoZ)**\n\nCity of Zion (CoZ) is a global community of open source enthusiasts, with the shared goal of helping NEO achieve its full potential.

While NEO\u2019s dBFT consensus algorithm is designed to achieve consensus with higher efficency and greater network throughputt, no amount of theoretical calculations can simulate the reality of real-life conditions.\n\n\n--**Key Observations**--\n\n\n**Smart Contract Invocations:**\n\nA total of 13,966 smart contracts invocations were executed on the NEO network over this time period, of which, nearly all called the RPX smart contract method `mintTokens`.\nA total of 543,348,500 RPX tokens were successfully minted and transferred to user accounts, totalling 10,097 smart contract executions.\n\n\n**Refunded Invocations:**\n\nA total of 4182 refund events were triggered by the smart contract method `mintTokens`. (Note: RPX has stated that these refunds will be processed within the next two weeks.)\n\n\n**Crowdsale statistics:**\n\nA successful `mintTokens` execution used around 1043 VM operations, while an execution that resulted in a refund used 809 VM operations. Within the hour and six minutes that the token sale was active, a total of 12,296,409 VM operations were executed.\nA total of 9,575 unique addresses participated in the RPX ICO. Half of these, approximately 4,800 unique addresses, participated through CoZ\u2019s Neon wallet.\nThe top 3 blocks with the most transactions were block 1445025 (3,242 transactions), block 1444902 (2,951 transactions), and block 1444903 (1609 transactions).\n\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nAt the moment, the consensus nodes for the NEO network are operated by the NEO Council in China. By Q1 2018, NEO Council aims to control less than two-thirds of the consensus nodes.\n\nWe are pleased to note that the NEO network continuted to operate efficiently with minimal network impact, even under extreme network events. Block generation time initially slowed down to 3 minutes to process the largest block, but quickly recovered to approximately 25 seconds. Throughout the entire RPX ICO, consensus nodes were able to achieve consensus and propagate new block transactions to the rest of the network.\nIn closing, while we consider this performance to be excellent, NEO Council and City of Zion areworking closely together on upgrades, that will increase the throughputs of the NEO network.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Hyperledger**\n\n**Members and governance of Hyperledger:**\n\nEarly members of the initiative included blockchain ISVs, (Blockchain, ConsenSys, Digital Asset, R3, Onchain), well-known technology platform companies (Cisco, Fujitsu, Hitachi, IBM, Intel, NEC, NTT DATA, Red Hat, VMware), financial services firms (ABN AMRO, ANZ Bank, BNY Mellon, CLS Group, CME Group, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group, J.P. Morgan, State Street, SWIFT, Wells Fargo), Business Software companies like SAP, Systems integrators and others such as: (Accenture, Calastone, Credits, Guardtime, IntellectEU, Nxt Foundation, Symbiont).\n\nThe governing board of the Hyperledger Project consists of twenty members chaired by Blythe Masters, (CEO of Digital Asset), and a twelve-member Technical Steering Committee chaired by Christopher Ferris, CTO of Open Technology at IBM.\n\nhttp://www.8btc.com/onchain-hyperledger\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperledger\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a leading open-source contributor in China\u2019s blockchain community, Onchain shares the same values as the Linux Foundation and the Hyperledger project intrinsically.

Woo-wee that was some ride.\nMy optimism was blased apart within a few short weeks as mine (and most of yours) portfolio was completely decimated. But I hodled strong through the carnage and sleepless nights and 'WTF was I thinking'. What else could I do in reality. Sell at 70% down or more? \n\nWhen things stabilised a bit I added more, not a whole lot, but I dipped my toes in and feel I and we are in a better position than ever . 2018 should be a banner year .\n\nTake-aways\n1) I completely failed to spot the top of the market. I knew it was very bubbly but somehow was fairly convince that it would keep riding upwards with just small bumps in the road. Instead we have the worst crash the crypto markets have experienced in perhaps 4 or 5 years. \n\n2) I didn't use tether and tether was the big 'fear' of the markets. It's still dodgy as hell, but it helped make some folks even richer, and it certainly was a damp squid compared to the actual crash we experienced. Now with new stable coin options and increasing regulation I think we have passed the most dangerous time regarding Tether. Some folks probably rode their luck on that one, good for you I guess.\n\n3) I completely underestimated how a dumping BTC would kill everything including Ethereum. So called flippening never happened. \n\nProjection : Ethereum sure looks good for upside now. So does BTC.\nThe only major concern now is if Ethereum will be a security or not. If investing in the big two it might be a good idea to split the investment between BTC and ETH (just in case ETH is declared as a security, BTC is a commodity and it might take up the slack from the dollars that would have been invested in ETH). If ETH is not declared a security, happy days as ETH and BTC should both be very strong contenders in their respective divisions. If stocks are used as reference Wall Street funds tend to prefer the big cap coins with lots of liquidity and transparency in holdings and which have proven themselves over a few years. \n\nI also hold a bunch of other stuff , IOTA, OMG, you name it..it's more fun that way but you'd probaby do pretty well just holding ETH and BTC.",

You have two options - either invest long term (hodl) or do shorter-term trades and rebalancing all the time. It is easy to calculate that in the latter case you have to make ~40% more (assuming US taxes) than in the former one. So, sure, I made some extra % when jumping from BTC to VEN, but probably not that much because I got into it when it started climbing already. For an average Joe like me the long-term holding i.e. an analogy of potato couch ETF portfolio in stock market is probably the best option. But if you do a lot of research and lucky you may still pull 10x returns in a short turn on some unicorns.\n\nSo, it's not different from stock market. You can do ETFs, i.e. invest in large portfolio of top-20 like OP suggests.

In backtesting, the indicator was able to flag NEO/Antshares in July 2017, Vechain in October 2017, and ICON in November 2017: all three went onto 10x in price. I\u2019m sharing the cryptos flagged this week below.\n\n**Background**: I wrote a program that scrapes reddit posts from r/cryptocurrency and r/altcoin, and calculates how much certain cryptocurrencies are mentioned, to help give an early indication of the next potential 10x crypto. Crowd sentiment has proven to be a good place to start for more research. I'm always working to make my insights more useful so please reach out with any comments, and stay tuned for updates!\n\nIf you prefer to follow along via email and get more kinds of insights every week, you can do so [here](https://www.cryptomintclub.com/).\n\n**Note**: *always* do your own research. Not all cryptos with a lot of mentions are being talked about for good/positive reasons (e.g. BitConnect). Keep reading for info on getting a list of all recent posts so you can browse the headlines and gauge sentiment. Sentiment is also only one piece of the puzzle: fundamental research on the project and team itself is required to make a good investment decision.\n\n**RECENTLY TRENDING CRYPTOS**\n\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n1. This week, a high throughput blockchain platform (**Zilliqa**), a blockchain powered internet, operating system, and runtime for dApps (**Elastos**), and a blockchain project for crypto-asset and other digital information inheritance (**DigiPulse**) appeared on our list of cryptos that the community is talking more about for the first time. All three are recent ICOs.\n\n2.

Check it out at r/coinhuntworld \n\nYou can earn it by unlocking crypto vaults with trivia questions and then they give it for free. It makes money because once it\u2019s out of beta and they feature more coins, people can advertise their coins using this app. So it\u2019s free for the user, and there could be some that are headed to the moon on it soon.\n\nIt\u2019s good for beginners, though you won\u2019t make a ton starting out. But hey, free is free and I\u2019ve already made about $55 in the past month, plus it\u2019s fun and gets me out of the house.

Our goal is to *empowers streamers by enabling them to connect directly with their audience, increase and control novel revenue avenues*.\n\n**Who:** [14 people strong](http://gimli.io/#Team), including\n\n*Technology:* Ouziel Slama, who co-developed counterparty, Joseph Fiscella who co-founded the Alexandria project\n  \n\n*Pro gamers:* Luffy - *street fighter IV world champion* , Stephano - *Starcraft 2 foreigner world champion*\n\n\n*Streamers:* Thud - CEO ASUS ROG school ; Skyyart, Aypierre\n  \n\n*Business:* cool (!) and experienced team (some Columbia, Harvard, Polytechnique), and real eSports fan \n\n**Why:** Streamers have massive audience in the hundreds of millions globally. Yet, due to ads-blockers and poor audience retention as soon as the live game over, streamers monetization of their viewers is low. \nWith Gimli, streamers can create entertainments and functionalities with GIM embedded commissions. From substantial source of direct GIM revenues, to better engagement, higher number of minutes watched and increased donations, Gimli's promise is to give control back to streamers.\n\n**Partners and adoption:** [Existing streaming partners](http://gimli.io/#partnerships) with more than one million twitter followers. Streamers set up functionalities and GIM they receive when their audience use Gimli on their stream. Partnering with them creates viral and exponential adoption.\n\n**Tokens:** GIM tokens are required to run all functionalities including donations, votes, bets and custom ones. Each functionality is a run by trustless Ethereum smart contracts tailor made for streamers. [Try our working PoC](http://demo.gimli.io/).\n\n**Crowdsale detail:** 90 Million GIM will be exchanged for ETH, with a portion reserved to eSport professionals and early backers. \n\n**Resources:**\n\n[http://gimli.io/](http://gimli.io)\n\n[Backend beta](http://demo.gimli.io)\n\n[White Paper](http://gimli.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Gimli-white-paper.pdf)\n\n[Team](http://gimli.io/#Team)\n\n[Telegram](http://www.t.me/thegimliproject)\n\n[Slack](https://auto-invite-contact.herokuapp.com/)\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/Zz5GT6)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/thegimliproject)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/thegimliproject/)\n\n[Bitcointalk.org full announcement](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2014659.0)\ncontact@gimli.io",

We will not end up like BAT\u00a0\u00a0Burning is definitely a good option, but it will also give the team a disproportionate amount of tokens. Distributing all the tokens to the fraction of everyone's contribution would be the answer but we want to prevent whales as much as we can to enhance distribution of the sale\"\n\nThis is not the answer i hoped for.

            "text": "I\u2019ve decided to document my journey with an experiment in crypto investing that involves creating a Crypto Index Fund of sorts.\n\nWith a nod and hat tip to Brett McLain (http://blog.mclain.ca/31-crypto-currencies-week-1/) who was the inspiration for this experiment, as he enters week 14 of his own.\n\nWhere my experiment differs is in the number of cryptos selected, as well as the style of selection. Brett went with the Top 30 (actually he used 31 in the end) by Market Cap.\n\nFor my experiment, I shall be selecting 35 cryptos that I\u2019ve hand selected.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get the rules set.\n\n**The Rules**\n\n- 35 cryptocurrencies.\n- $350 total.\n- $10 of each, exactly. So coins like Bitcoin that are worth considerably more than $10, will be piece bought.\n- All bought on same day. Price paid is whatever price they were going for that day.\n- Weekly update, with analysis of how things are going.\n- Similar to the other $10 in x cryptos experiments, only this is my 35 specially chosen cryptos, not the top 35 by market cap.\n- Mix of established coins, along with some very new projects and hedges against other projects (for example, BTC & BCH).\n- All cryptos were bought on Tuesday 21st November.\n- No more buying after the first day.\n- No rebalancing or selling.\n- Holding for 1 year.\n\n**Why Am I Doing This Experiment?**\n\nPrimarily, this is a thought experiment for me. It\u2019s also a method that I hope proves whether a diversified portfolio is more effective in the long run than holding a single (or few) cryptos.\n\nI have longterm holds in a numbers of coins over a long period of time. This small-scale thought experiment is separate to that.\n\nAnd why do I think an \u201ccrypto index fund\u201d is such a good idea? This:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/aIxx3zu\n\nThat\u2019s a picture of the whole crypto market cap over the last year. It\u2019s rising constantly (especially in the last few months), and is only set to grow more (and more rapidly).\n\nSo an index fund that tracks a large segment of the market should be a really good thing. My profit will rise as the overall crypto market cap rises. That\u2019s what this experiment is all about.\n\nAnd if it isn\u2019t a good thing, we will see.\n\n**The Cryptos** \n\nHere are the cryptocurrencies I selected (listed by price):\n\n\n\nFoo | Bar\n---|---\nBitcoin | (BTC)\nBitcoin Cash | (BCH)\nDash | (DASH)\nEthereum | (ETH)\nZcash | (ZEC)\nMonero | (XMR)\nLitecoin | (LTC)\nNEO | (NEO)\nGas | (GAS)\nQtum | (QTUM)\nLisk | (LSK)\nOmiseGO | (OMG)\nWaves | (WAVES)\nWalton | (WTC)\nMetal | (MTL)\nVertcoin | (VTC)\nSalt | (SALT)\nMetaverse ETP | (ETP)\nNeblio | (NEBL)\nArk | (ARK)\nKomodo | (KMD)\nEOS | (EOS)\nModum | (MOD)\nAdEx | (ADX)\nKyber Network | (KNC)\nPowerLedger | (POWR)\niExec RLC | (RLC)\nCivic | (CVC)\nObsidian | (ODN)\nRise | (RISE)\nVeChain | (VEN)\nRipple | (XRP)\nChainlink | (LINK)\nRipio | (RCN)\nRequest Network | (REQ)\n\nA lot of research and thought went into selecting these 35. I don\u2019t want to get into too much detail about why I chose individual cryptos (although that might come later).\n\nFirst, I will answer the two most macro of questions first:\n\n- **Why 35?**\n\nThis is pretty simple. I wanted a large enough amount that would justify an \u201cindex fund\u201d without being unwieldy. As this isn\u2019t a traditional index fund, it would be ridiculously complex to buy 100s of cryptos individually and then be able to store them somewhere.\n\nI think 35 is a good number that allows for diversification and balance, without being too complex and unwieldly.\n\n- **Why these cryptos?**\n\nWhether all of these 35 cryptos will turn out to be successful (and I define success as giving me at least a 1.5x ROI in a year), will be an interesting part of the experiment.\n\nI chose these 35 for specific reasons individually and I made sure to choose a number of project types - straight up currencies, platforms, dApps, protocols, etc.\n\nIn this index fund, there will be small total supply coins, large total supply coins, large market cap coins, small market cap coins, old projects, new projects and everything in between.\n\nBut all of them are good projects, I believe. Time will tell and I invite questions and discussion about the cryptos themselves in the comments.\n\nBased on their Market Cap rankings, I put the 35 cryptos into a number of types that I\u2019ll explain a bit here:\n\n- **The Big Boys**\n\n- **The Second Tier**\n\n- **Emerging Upstarts**\n\nThe cryptos in The Big Boys section are pretty obvious. The established and time-tested players like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dash fit here.\n\nIn the Second Tier we have the potential future stars. Cryptos like NEO, OmiseGO and Lisk fit comfortably here.\n\nWhilst The Emerging Upstarts are filled with newer projects that are super solid, for example: Walton Chain, PowerLedger and Chainlink.\n\nBy selecting older and newer projects in this \u201ccrypto index fund\u201d I\u2019m hoping to leverage both money coming into the established/known cryptos, as well as potentially making bigger market cap jumps with some of the new projects that have far to run.\n\n**Potential Issues With the Experiment**\n\nSome obvious issues with my method became apparent pretty quickly:\n\n- Firstly, certain cryptos will naturally have an advantage (at least early on), if they were down that day compared to their usual average. \n\nSome coins were near all-time-highs, which will naturally skew the experiment a little and make it a little harder for them to succeed\u2026at least in the early stages of the experiment. For example, Bitcoin happened to be very near its ATH when I bought it for the experiment. NEO and AdEx were also very near their tops. \n\n- The natural volatility of Bitcoin meant that I wasn\u2019t able to hit exactly on $10 for each, and some of the values are therefore a little off-kilter because of that. I did the best I could.\n\n- Due to the relatively small amounts involved, I probably won\u2019t be taking these off the exchanges I bought them on (transaction fees). Leaving on exchanges isn\u2019t ideal (for obvious reasons), but this experiment is more about the thought experiment for me. My large holdings are in cold storage. \n\n**Moving Forwards**\n\n\nI bought these cryptos on Tuesday 21st November. I will, therefore, be doing a weekly update every Tuesday where I chart the experiment\u2019s progress.\n\nI'll be including charts/graphs in future updates, so that we can see a visual representation of what's going on.\n\nI\u2019ll be making a site to chronicle this experiment and give it a home. \n\nLet me know what you think of my plan - I\u2019m open to constructive criticism and any thoughts you might have.\n\n**Sources and Helpful Resources**\n\nHere\u2019s some of the many resources I consulted for this project:\n\nhttps://digitalassetdbtest.azurewebsites.net/\n\nhttp://aenigma.capital/Leveraging-the-Cryptoeconomic-Machine.pdf\n\nhttps://www.whatbitcoindid.com/portfolio/\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/\n\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en\n\nhttps://coincheckup.com/\n\nFeel free to follow me here for more regular updates: https://twitter.com/cryptoindexfund",

A prime example of this is **Dracula Protocol**. Their community engagement in Telegram is golden when it comes to FUD shared on the channel. Everyone is ready to answer and knows where to find the answers.\n\nA smart project makes sure their devs pop on your channel a few times a week and are ready to answer any questions. The only kind of FUD that should be banned if a mod notices someone stating the same FUD over and over again even if they have received a clear answer multiple times. Then the fudders are only after a lower entry point and in fact they are hurting the project.\n\nStill, letting FUD be open on your channel is dealing openly with constructive criticism, and that makes you BASED.\n\n***-> Use FUD to deal with the weak spots.***\n\nAnother effective way to use FUD for the benefit of your project is to make your FUD as stupid as possible. Let's say a project has locked their liquidity forever. That means they really can't rug. Here a stupid FUD argument would be \"THIS IS A RUG, SELL NOW!\".\n\nWhen someone is reading this conversation they get concerned and want to know if the fudder is right. This is why a\\_concerned\\_person\\_pays\\_attention to the comment dealing with the FUD - and when people pay attention, it is way easier to shill your solid project to them.\n\nI have seen this working great on a project called **Toad Network**. They also have a weekly FUD Friday to dig up the weak spots of their progress to deal with any yellow flags that new people entering would raise.\n\n**-> Use FUD for attention.**\n\nOne last thing one can use FUD with is to build anticipation. This is a double-edged sword and should be used wisely.\n\nIf you have a diamond solid project that has the best history, has the most open and high-skilled team and real trust with community, you can make\\_them\\_wait. Let's say you have your code openly on Github to anyone to go through and people can see you are building it every week. Still the launch day gets delayed a few times. This creates fear, uncertainty and doubt in the weakest minds in the community. Now what happens then?\n\nThe people that know the project well will notice the FUD that someone is experiencing. They will point out facts to this person and educate them more about the project, about the tech, the history of the team, about the upcoming marketing, partnerships etc.\n\nAlso, the well-educated may become bored waiting. One bad thing that can happen is that they start becoming silent in the community. But a half of them will start helping the project, building themselves, making memes, writing Medium articles, Reddit posts or do daily tweets. This is all fueled\\_by\\_anticipation\\_in\\_them - And in the end it pays out big time.\n\nBut as I mentioned, this is a double-edged sword and you need to know your community and be very transparent of your doings and the development and have a long history. One project that now has this advantage is **Ethereum** with it's future scaling. Another one would be **Dracula Protocol** already mentioned above in this writing.\n\n***-> You use FUD to build anticipation in your own mind.***\n\nComment below your ways to use FUD for your benefit **without hurting a project**. :)",

Well, when it comes to the best blockchain casinos, what makes them special is a technology in the blockchain system called **Ethereum**. One specific example to be taken into account is Myoddz.bet casino (www.myoddz.bet) .\n\nTypical casinos comprise a \u2018middle-man\u2019 entity in every transaction which verifies each and every transaction. This makes pretty expensive and often faulty because they are always involved in conflicting transactions. Blockchain casinos, on the other hand, operate on a totally different principle where virtually there is no intermediary to verify records but a network of many blocks that do the authentication.\n\n**Advantages of using a blockchain casino:**\n\n* impossible to alter original data;\n\n* the capability for random number generation in a completely decentralized and authenticatable way;\n\n* cheaper compared to any other casino;\n\n* virtually impossible to hack.\n\nAs cryptocurrency world is growing we will attend a transition from traditional casinos to the blockchain ones. Fairness is guaranteed and the system is totally \u201chacker \u2013proof\u201d because of its decentralized nature.\n\n**Why is Myoddz.bet worth a chance?**\n\n Their system provides you dividents payouts so it's like actually owning a blockchain casino!

With the beta release of IOTA Smart Contracts, IOTA offers programmable smart contracts on the IOTA 2.0 DevNet, including early support for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and smart contracts written in Solidity, Go (TinyGo) and Rust. We are currently working on extended EVM support, further optimization and porting smart contracts to the IOTA mainnet. Together with the integration of the Tokenization framework, it will offer a powerful solution for seamless, trustless and feeless interoperability and composability between smart contracts on IOTA. \n\nAn article on ZDNet:\n\n [IOTA is bringing smart contracts with zero fees, Ethereum interoperability, and compatibility for next-gen distributed apps | ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iota-is-bringing-smart-contracts-with-zero-fees-ethereum-interoperability-and-compatibility-for-next-generation-distributed-applications/)",

Many coins that have no real value at all and will die back off whenever they leave the coin. \n\nAs the value begins to climb smaller investors who are not in the know begin to believe in that coin. They think it is really going to take off so they decide to buy some. By the time  they have seen the coins rise then the pump is probably close to over and the dump is going to begin leaving them with money in a shit coin that no one truly wants. DO NOT DO THIS.\n\nIt seems that the pumpers are taking their profit from this scam and moving it into ethereum for safe holding. This practice has messed up the entire market and lost a lot of people a lot of money. This isn't good for the cryptocurrency world and makes the market look like a scam. \n\nTo stop it......do not try to jump onto their pump band wagon. If you see a coin suddenly out of no where, that has went up 40-50%, do not invest in it. It is a scam.\n\n If you are currently holding a coin that is being pumped then ride it up to around 40-50% and sell it out from under the pumpers. This is the most powerful way for everyone to stop this. Once they begin getting stuck with shit coins then they will stop. ",

It's unfortunate now but if people are investing without doing their research or consulting someone knowledgeable that they trust then it's a big risk they're taking. Cryptos are so volatile right now that you can't be an informed investor and expect everything to give 1000% returns. \n\nI do think more people will lose money but in the long term as people become more cautious and stop chasing candles, we'll see the PUDs reduce as well the gains at which point it'll come down to which of these projects have actual real world value. I think that's to be expected tho.",

I have \u20ac10K in extra cash that doesn't really mean a great deal to me. One year from now, I'll be moving to a new country and this cash will basically determine how comfortable we are during that shift (three months where my wife won't have a salary, but I will). If that \u20ac10K becomes \u20ac0, no big deal, we'll be fine on my salary alone without having to dip into our savings.\n\nIf the \u20ac10K grows into a larger number, it just means that we'll be able to really enjoy ourselves during those three months before my wife starts working again: rent a nice house, take lots of little trips, splurge on our new life abroad, etc. \n\nSo I'm going to invest this \u20ac10K into 10 cryptocurrencies for the next 12 months. This thread will mark the beginning of my research into which 10 CCs those will be.\n\nEdit: Yes, I'm a gambling man. And yes, we can afford to gamble this money.",

Market Cap is calculated according to the following simple formula:\n\n**Market Cap = Current Coin/Token Price (Current Price) X Circulating Supply**\n\nFor instance, if a coin is currently priced at $10 and its circulating supply is 3,000,000 tokens, its total market capitalization would be 10 x 3,000,000 = $30,000,000.\n\nA coin with a very small price, but with a very large circulating supply, can have a market capitalization value that is much higher than that of extremely high prices whose supply is too small.\n\nTherefore, this metric will be especially important in determining the size of a certain coin instead of relying on the current price that most new investors often apply.\n\n# What does it do for the investors?\n\nThe market capitalization of a coin gives investors a relative view of the performance of these coins.\n\nWe can divide the coins into 3 types:\n\n**Large-Cap:** These coins have a very large market cap (>1 billion USD) including the top of the largest cryptocurrencies today such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or Ripple.\n\n**Mid-Cap:** Medium market cap, lower than the above coins and typically range in capitalization from $100M to $1 billion\n\n**Small-Cap (Small Cap):** low market cap (<100M US$)\n\nYou can view these indicators on major cryptocurrency reporting sites like CoinmarketCap or CoinGecko\n\nOne of the important properties of Market Cap is that it is closely related to the price movements of that coin. More specifically, the larger the capitalization, the less volatility, and conversely, the smaller the cap, the stronger the price movement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ What is the difference between Large - Cap Coin and Small-Cap Coin? ](https://preview.redd.it/r65cov2xb4771.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e595934a56e3818348841222f842401bbaa848)\n\n \n\nTherefore, new coins/tokens with small capitalization will often have the potential for a huge price increase, but with high risk. So investing in these coins/tokens can bring you great returns when x10 x100 times assets if at good times. Larger cap coins still have potential but can\u2019t give you such a big reward!\n\nHowever, the value of the market cap is not a determining factor as it cannot give you a complete picture of the potential of a coin. Note that these are relative figures only.\n\nWe BSCArmy always advise doing comprehensive research before investing in cryptocurrencies and taking into account all important considerations. Market capitalization as a statistic doesn\u2019t tell you anything about actual trading volumes in the last few hours. As a result, it\u2019s a good idea to check Coinmarketcap for a cryptocurrency\u2019s 24-hour trading volume on several exchanges over a respectable time period.\n\n***Source:*** [https://bscarmy.com/what-is-market-cap/](https://bscarmy.com/what-is-market-cap/)",

            "text": "This is something I've been looking at for the last month. Some of these can be scams or are just plain gambling. I also think they can serve a purpose of hedging larger investments if you find one that is worth while. The fundamentals behind these tokens that make them worth while are seen regularly but having them all in one project seems to be rare.\n\nIt's important for these investments to have an active organic community. Most of these new low market cap crypto currency's are filled with bots. Investing in a token that is filled with bots is just throwing your money at something hoping a project gains traction. This is essentially gambling as a community with real humans actively believes in the project and the utility behind it.\n\nUtility is another important factor when investing in these tokens. If the project has no utility it will inevitably lead to a pump and dump. As price rises the investors will begin to question the value of the token. If there is no value (utility) people will begin exiting there position in mass once the price starts to take massive leaps. This doesn't mean the token has to be Ethereum's replacement but it has to have some use case. This could be NFT's, games, or a meme platform. These alone don't personally show a lot of value to me but sometimes these tokens have bigger dreams than that. This is when I believe the token is a diamond in the rough. A good dev team will consider this before the launch of the token and be transparent about the future.\n\nThe dev team is the most important aspect of any project. Having dev's that you recognize from other projects or have a positive reputation is a good sign that you've found something worthwhile. Dev's not only create and improve the project itself but also help market the project to help get it off the ground. When dev's are active in the community and helping it grow organically alongside the community its a good sign. This is another reason these low market cap crypto currency turn into pump and dumps. The same as no utility, if the community doesn't trust the dev team, they will make whatever money they were aiming to make and exit their position.\n\nFor a crypto currency to maintain its community and progress into a real project like SHIB, DOGE, and SAFEMOON. I believe it needs all of these fundamentals simultaneously. If one is missing people will lose faith and get out in mass. If you choose to get into these please remember to DYOR and that even a good project at a low market cap can be high risk. Only invest what you can afford to lose because in this space even if something ticks all the boxes it can potentially go to nothing.\n\nI forgot to mention. It's a scam if a few wallets hold a significant amount of the token or if there is some reason you can't sell the token after you buy it. Non scam's will allow you to sell whenever you want. Also, look at the chart, these tokens are not different from any other investing. There will be corrections, if a chart is looking too green over a long period be careful.",

            "text": "DCC stands for Distributed Credit Chain. The platform which is based on blockchain technology aims to become a parallel banking channel rather than just the institutions which are currently controlling the entire finance industry. With the help of decentralized platform, banking services can be provided by the various different stakeholders rather than just the registered banks.\n\nWhen you look at the services of the banks that is providing loans as well as allowing to invest in various assets and other avenues, hardly any other institution is able to provide the same range of services. This makes the banks create a monopoly. However, monopoly is bad for any kind of business. That is why this platform is trying to create an ecosystem for distributed banking. Only with the help of distributed banking, the competition will increase and the level of service which will be provided will be higher. This is one of the main reasons why distributed banking holds such a lot of promise.\n\nThis platform will actually create different stakeholders so that such services can be provided. It will also be identifying the individuals or the consumers with their real-world identities. As a result, fake accounts cannot be created. With the help of the real-world identities, ID will be provided to the consumers which will be known by the name of DCCID. With the help of this ID, the stakeholders will be able to decide whether the individual can be allowed to invest in different projects or whether the individual can be granted a loan. All of this information will be available to the stakeholders which are providing the services to the individual. The exact identity of the individual will not be revealed. Moreover, there will be a proper credit system for the stakeholders to decide whether the banking services can be provided or not.\n\nAlso, based on the cryptocurrency Holdings of the individuals, the loans can be provided as well. With the help of these collateralized loans, the interest rate which the individuals will be able to get will be on the lower side. Also, there will be proper tracking of the repayment capability. As a result, it will become easier for the stakeholders to grant bigger and bigger loans depending on the credit history.\n\nCurrently, the platform is coming out with an ICO.\n\n**DCC ICO details:**\n\n* Date of ICO: 28-05-2018 to 28-06-2018\n* Platform: Ethereum\n* Token acronym: DCC\n* Price of token: 13,700 DCC = 1 ETH\n\nAs the platform is trying to provide services to the under-banked customers, it holds a lot of potential.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThus, if you believe in the amalgamation of the finance industry with the blockchain industry, you should definitely look at this platform. If indeed, it is able to provide such collateralized services to the consumers and also provides them with the normal banking products, the potential in this platform is immense. If you\u2019re looking to invest in ICOs, this is one which you should definitely look at. You have to make sure that you can hold it for a longer period of time in order to generate any kind of returns from this ICO.\n\nOfficial website: [http://www.dcc.finance/](http://www.dcc.finance/)",

            "text": "**TL;DR:** I simulated a 1-year movement of 10 top cryptocurrencies using an advanced statistical method called geometric Brownian motion, which you can find below. I also created a spreadsheet to simulate prices of ~24 different cryptocurrencies, which you can download here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eUIgBowJs2NyKw7kYbx5z_VeCOxsMQdNELfbngs4XnY/copy. The sheet utilizes a paid add-in, which I provide free of cost to those who are less fortunate. \n\n## THE MYSTERY OF PRICE MOVEMENT\n\nSo, you\u2019re sitting at your computer with money to invest.\n\nYou have made some good money already in the market, but you want more.\n\nCryptocurrencies have reached a record [$600 billion in market value](https://www.ccn.com/cryptocurrency-market-cap-climbs-to-600-billion-as-bitcoin-price-recovery-continues/) after the recovery, with the inevitable $700 billion mark right around the corner.\n\nThe price movement of top currencies remains a mystery. But it doesn\u2019t have to be.\n\n## THE PAIN OF UNCERTAINTY\n\nCryptocurrencies are volatile, irrational beasts.\n\nSimple methods of forecasting grossly over/underestimate the potential of a volatile currency.\n\nFor example, moving averages are used frequently to estimate future prices. Moving averages, however, [suffer from many pitfalls](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/11/pitfalls-moving-averages.asp?lgl=rira-layout) that make them poor estimators of volatile markets.\n\nEvery great and successful investor has a plan. You will add one more tool to your arsenal today.\n\n## A BETTER METHOD FOR ESTIMATING CRYPTO PRICES\n\nIn my prior article about [estimating the movement of Bitcoin Prices](https://medium.com/@spreadstreet/bitcoin-madness-how-to-simulate-bitcoin-prices-in-google-sheets-c61cb42f26ed), I spoke of a method that is used frequently in the stock world to estimate prices.\n\nThis method is a Monte Carlo simulation using the geometric Brownian motion model.\n\nI won\u2019t cover off on the full methodology here, but essentially I am going to:\n\n1.  Get historical daily prices for 10 top cryptocurrencies\n2.  Calculate daily returns\n3.  Simulate a year\n4.  Simulate a year many times\n\nBy the end of the article, you will have the following:\n\n* A one-year simulation of top cryptocurrencies\n* Likely price range of each cryptocurrency\n* A downloadable model to complete yourself\n\n*A note on forecasting, simulations, and recommendations: Monte Carlo\nsimulations are to be used as guidelines and tools, not as gospel. I am not\noffering financial or investing advice.*\n\n## BITCOIN\n\n#### What is Bitcoin?\n\nYou know what Bitcoin is, stop it.\n\n#### One-Year Simulation\n\n[1-Year Simulation of Bitcoin Prices and Returns](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*urHMeecyVx17Fr6zQRs4lA.png)\n\n#### One-Year Simulated 1,000 Times\n\n[1-Year Bitcoin Prices Simulated 1,000 times](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*Mh7NEK_rOlW5qisAidn0Xw.png)\n\n#### Verdict\n\nWe can be 95% certain that **Bitcoin prices will fall between $9,095, and $371,588 with a median of $60,837**.\n\n## BITCOIN CASH\n\n#### What is Bitcoin Cash?\n\nFrom the Bitcoin Cash project website:\n\n> \u201cBitcoin Cash is peer-to-peer electronic cash for the Internet.

The next hard fork, called Constantinople,\nwas recently discussed during an Ethereum core developer meeting and could\ninclude Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Casper update.\n\n#### One-Year Simulation\n\n[1-Year Simulation of Ethereum Prices and Returns](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*Z6eKkQXb0mIGfDOulvhwzA.png)\n\n#### One-Year Simulated 1,000 Times\n\n[1-Year Ethereum Prices Simulated 1,000 times](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*MbLrkDqEiF7ZaiwEUcwYbg.png)\n\n#### Verdict\n\nWe can be 95% certain that **Ethereum prices will fall between $193, and $8,027\nwith a median of $1,267**.\n\n## EOS\n\n#### What is EOS?\n\nEOS is a blockchain-based, decentralized operating system, designed to support\ncommercial-scale decentralized applications by providing all of the necessary\ncore functionality, enabling businesses to build blockchain applications in a\nway similar to web-based applications.\n\n#### One-Year Simulation\n\n[1-Year Simulation of EOS Prices and Returns](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*0TS8EizPApfxm_T0d9be7w.png)\n\n#### One-Year Simulated 1,000 Times\n\n[1-Year EOS Prices Simulated 1,000 times](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*_d52Hl9jHCkBZrcdf5QBpA.png)\n\n#### Verdict\n\nWe can be 95% certain that **EOS prices will fall between $0.98, and $1,386 with\na median of $33**.\n\n## LITECOIN\n\n#### What is Litecoin?\n\nLitecoin\u2019s claim to fame is faster transaction processing times. It uses a\nscrypt-based mining proof-of-work algorithm to target the regular computers and\nGPUs most people already have.\n\nThe ability to target regular computers and GPU\u2019s happens to be a huge\ndifferentiator from the crowded mining population of Bitcoin.\n\n#### One-Year Simulation\n\n[1-Year Simulation of Litecoin Prices and Returns](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*Y68-_K8AelNm0uISx61RIw.png)\n\n#### One-Year Simulated 1,000 Times\n\n[1-Year Litecoin Prices Simulated 1,000 times](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*rrdHRBBLhGiD2QLjBT_oKA.png)\n\n#### Verdict\n\nWe can be 95% certain that **Litecoin prices will fall between $42, and $12,241\nwith a median of $745**.\n\n## OMISEGO\n\n#### What is OmiseGO?\n\nOmiseGO is building a couple of things:\n\n1.  Decentralized exchange\n2.  Liquidity provider mechanism\n3.  Clearinghouse messaging network\n4.  Asset-backed blockchain gateway\n\nOmiseGO is not owned by any single one party. Instead, it is an open distributed\nnetwork of validators which enforce behavior of all participants.\n\nAccording to\n[Blocknight](https://medium.com/@coinrepeater/what-is-omisego-omg-72fd1e532d3e):\n\n> Also, OmiseGo counts Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum), and Joseph Poon (Lightning\n> Network Co Author) among their advisers. Joseph Poon is actually billed as\nauthor of the OmiseGo whitepaper.\n\nThose are some pretty big names.\n\n#### One-Year Simulation\n\n[1-Year Simulation of OmiseGO Prices and Returns](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*KTTQKYxPI5x8iVULLCA7sQ.png)\n\n#### One-Year Simulated 1,000 Times\n\n[1-Year OmiseGO Prices Simulated 1,000 times](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*S2vMp4dTkj1UX9gKM7Ml4g.png)\n\n#### Verdict\n\nWe can be 95% certain that **OmiseGO prices will fall between $0.62, and $185.35\nwith a median of $8.56**.\n\n## NEO\n\n#### What is NEO?\n\nNEO (formerly known as AntShares) is a smart asset platform and the first open\nsource public blockchain project in China.

From the [xrphodor\nblog](https://xrphodor.wordpress.com/):\n\n> Ripple is a US-based company.\n\n> Why is this an important point to consider? A US-based company like Ripple is\n> subject to some very stringent laws regarding securities trading and money\ntransmission. These include requirements that define how Ripple might interact\nwith crypto markets and both institutional and retail crypto traders.\n\n#### One-Year Simulation\n\n[1-Year Simulation of Ripple Prices and Returns](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*GDdxIecE4I5suTZUAGr_Iw.png)\n\n#### One-Year Simulated 1,000 Times\n\n[1-Year Ripple Prices Simulated 1,000 times](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*fWyK2FgQdx7TjVz50xOR8Q.png)\n\n#### Verdict\n\nWe can be 95% certain that **Ripple prices will fall between $0.05, and $163\nwith a median of $2.71**.\n\n## MONERO\n\n#### What is Monero?\n\nMonero attempts to solve privacy and fungibility issues that persist in Bitcoin.\n\nPart of the algorithm for Monero automatically mixes transactions with previous\ntransactions and does this by implementing ring signatures.\n\n#### One-Year Simulation\n\n[1-Year Simulation of Monero Prices and Returns](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*_rjhaDv6ZRmxeDs16Bk1Mg.png)\n\n#### One-Year Simulated 1,000 Times\n\n[1-Year Monero Prices Simulated 1,000 times](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*B25Mnjeer-qyQhZelDPYTw.png)\n\n#### Verdict\n\nWe can be 95% certain that **Monero prices will fall between $68, and $8,142\nwith a median of $760**.\n\n## Zcash\n\n#### What is Zcash?\n\nFrom the [Blockchainhub\ninfographic](https://blockchainhub.net/blog/infographics/zcash-explained/):\n\n> Zcash is a permissionless cryptocurrency that can fully protect the privacy of\n> transactions using zero-knowledge cryptography.\n\n#### One-Year Simulation\n\n[1-Year Simulation of ZCash Prices and Returns](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*2fZ-f8Hyv84iUvVTxyJv_A.png)\n\n#### One-Year Simulated 1,000 Times\n\n[1-Year ZCash Prices Simulated 1,000 times](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*8KUc4p3k9Dxi66sVkC5qug.png)\n\n#### Verdict\n\nWe can be 95% certain that **Zcash prices will fall between $54, and $6,259 with\na median of $549**.\n\n## YOUR VERY OWN FORECASTING TOOL\n\nSince i\u2019m so nice, I went ahead and created a forecasting tool for you to use:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eUIgBowJs2NyKw7kYbx5z_VeCOxsMQdNELfbngs4XnY/copy\n\n### SERVICES USED:\n\n1.  Google Sheets\n2.  [Spreadstreet Google Sheets\nAdd-in](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spreadstreet/fghpmppcbabgnpekploacbjijhppnkpp?authuser=0)\n3.  StockTwits\n4.  CoinMarketCap API\n\nFull disclosure: The google sheets add-in is a 14-day free trial, and $15 per\nmonth after. However, no one should be refused access on the basis of money\n(especially true for students and less fortunate). Send me a message, and I will\nmake sure you are not left in the dark.\n\n### A NOTE ON SECURITY\n\nUsers have expressed hesitation about running a google sheets add-in on their\nmain computer, so I will attempt to ease those concerns:\n\n* I am located in the U.S., and my business is registered in the state of Maryland\n* If this were malicious, people would have downvoted the add-in into oblivion,\nand it would have been removed from the store\n* **If you are still worried, you can open it within a virtual machine and test it\nfirst**\n\n### WHAT IT PULLS:\n\n* 90-day history of ~24 different cryptocurrencies\n* 1-Year simulation of prices\n* 1-Year simulation of returns\n* 1-Year simulation ran 1,000 times\n\n### GETTING THE SPREADSHEET TO WORK FOR YOU\n\n**Install the Spreadstreet add-in for Google Sheets**\n\n* [Click this link to download the Spreadstreet Google Sheets\nAdd-in](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spreadstreet/fghpmppcbabgnpekploacbjijhppnkpp?authuser=0)\n* Follow the installation instructions included with the add-in and log-in\n\n**Get sheet ready for use with the add-in**\n\n* Important Open the template, click the menu Add-ons / Spreadstreet / Help / View\nin store, and then click Manage and in the dropdown menu click Use in this\ndocument.\n* Login to the Spreadstreet add-in for the first time (Add-ons -> Spreadstreet ->\nOpen) and keep the window open\n\n**After logging into the add-in, change the dropdown reference**\n\n* In the analysis tab, change the \u201cSELECT CURRENCY\u201d dropdown (B3) to one of the\nother choices\u2026this refreshes the pull\n* Note: CoinMarketCap API has limits. Be careful when attempting to refresh the\nsheet too many times\n\n### TROUBLESHOOTING\n\n1.  *Important* Open the template, click the menu Add-ons / Spreadstreet / Help /\nView in store, and then click Manage and in the dropdown menu click \u201cUse in this\ndocument.\u201d\n2.  A reload of the entire worksheet fixes quite a few problems.\n3.  Deleting and re-pasting the formula in A1 of the \u201cCandles\u201d tab fixes things as\nwell.\n4.  If all else fails, drop me a message\n5.  The \u201cSELECT CURRENCY\u201d cell in the Analysis tab (B3) refreshes the pull. Change\nthe results for new data.\n\n**When I try and change a coin, I get a #DIV/0 error**\n\nLogin to the Spreadstreet add-in, and keep the window open. Try changing the\ndropdown again.\n\n**I have tried logging in, activating the template with \u201cUse in this document\u201d\nand refreshed the sheet\u2026still nothing.**\n\nHead to the \u201cData\u201d tab. Delete the formula in cell A1, and repaste the\nfollowing: =SS(\u201ccandles-bitfinex\u201d, ticker, \u201c1D\u201d, \u201chist\u201d, true, \u201c\u201d, \u201c\u201d, \u201c\u201d, \u201c0\u201d)\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nWhether you are investing in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or SpankCoin, it is imperative\nto have a plan. Most notably, a worst-case scenario.\n\nThe Monte Carlo simulation is a fantastic way to get a range of prices for a\ncryptocurrency. And after reading this, you can see how the final values change\ndrastically depending on what you are looking at.\n\nI urge you to download the sheet and try your own hand at simulating different\ncoins. The sheet is setup to pull in every single coin from CoinMarketCap.\n\nCheers, and happy hunting\n\nOriginal article can be found here: https://medium.com/@spreadstreet/10-statistical-price-predictions-for-10-cryptocurrencies-january-2018-3dcf04bf9d9a\n\n## RELATED POSTS\n\n[Financial Modeling for Cryptocurrencies: The spreadsheet that got me my first\n1,000%\ngain](https://medium.com/spreadstreet/financial-modeling-for-cryptocurrencies-the-spreadsheet-that-got-me-my-first-1-000-gain-f4d0d1a6e5ed)\n\n[A Super Simple Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Spreadsheet for Finding Mismatched\nPrices](https://medium.com/spreadstreet/a-super-simple-cryptocurrency-arbitrage-spreadsheet-for-finding-mismatched-prices-a6e8b12dd8b0)\n\n[Bitcoin Madness: How to Simulate Bitcoin Prices in Google\nSheets](https://medium.com/@spreadstreet/bitcoin-madness-how-to-simulate-bitcoin-prices-in-google-sheets-c61cb42f26ed)\n\n[7 Smart Ethereum Price Prediction Methods for\nHODL\u2019ers](https://medium.com/@spreadstreet/7-smart-ethereum-price-prediction-methods-for-hodlers-7f08aad60cb1)",

But they are offering something around 800% APY to 5000% APY from what I\u2019ve seen...how is that possible? \n\nDefinitely going to start staking now that their rewards are online.

I'm very excited about this coin, and if you're asking why I did this...I'm trying out my AMA consolidating script that I wrote for fun :) I'm interested in seeing what people think about this coin! You can read the responses directly from this link: https://www.reddit.com/r/RaiBlocks/comments/7ko5l7/colin_lemahieu_founder_and_lead_developer_of/\n\n_______________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What are your top priorities atm? Both in developing areas itself and in terms of integration?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe top priorities right now are:\n\n- Wallets desktop/mobile and ease-of-use improvements to the node\n\n- Integration with exchanges\n\n- Vendor adoption wider user adoption\n\nThese basically need to happen in a sequence because each item isn't useful unless the previous one is complete.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_______________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Do you have any plans to have your source code peer reviewed? By peer review I mean sending your source code down to MIT for testing and review.**\n\n**Where do you see Raiblocks 5-10 years from now? (For instance do you envision people using a Raiblocks mobile phone app to transfer value between each other, or buy stuff at the store?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe definitely need peer and code reviews and we're open to anyone doing this. We have ideas for people in universities that want to analyze the whitepaper or code so we'll see what comes of that. In my opinion code security guarantees can only be given with (eyes * time) and we need both.\n\nI'd like to see RaiBlocks adopted as an internet RFC and basically become an ubiquitous background technology like http. I think you're probably right and a mobile app would be the most user-friendly way to do this so people don't need to carry around extra cards in their wallet etc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_______________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Is there a list of the team readily available? Are there firm plans to expand, and if so, in which directions?**\n\n**The roadmap indicated a website redesign scheduled for November 2017. Is there an update?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe have about 12 people in the core team; about half are code and half are business developers. On the redesigned website we're going to include bios for sure, no one in our team is anonymous. I think we have pretty good coverage of what we need right now, we could always use more people capable of contributing to the core code.\n\nThe website design is well underway, we wanted to streamline and add some more things to it so it took longer than originally estimated. It'll looking like after the new year we'll have it ready.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_______________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Would you ever consider renaming the coin to simply \"Rai\" or any other simplified form other than RaiBlocks?**\n\n**2. What marketing strategy do you think will push XRB forward from now on as a fully working product. Instant and free, the green coin, \"it just works\" coin, etc?**\n\n**3. Regarding security, is \"quantum-proofing\" a big concern at the moment and how do you guys plan to approach this when the time comes. And how possible would it be for bad actors to successfully implement a 51% attack.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. Yea there are a few difficulties people have pointed out with our name. People don't know if it's \"ray\" or \"rye\". \"Blocks\" doesn't have a meaning to a lot of people and the name reference might be too esoteric to be meaningful. I'm not prideful so I'm not stuck on a particular name, we'll take a look at what our marketing and business developers say peoples' impressions are and if they have any naming recommendations.\n\n2. Our marketing strategy is to focus on complete simplicity. Instant and free resonates with enthusiasts and mass adoption will only come when using xrb is absolutely the same experience as using a banking or other payment app. People aren't going to tolerate jargon or confusing workflows when sending or receiving payments.\n\n3. Quantum computing is going to be an amazing leap for humanity but it's also going to cause a lot of flux in cryptography. The plan I see is the similar to what I did in selecting the cryptographic algorithms we're using right now: look for leaders in academia and industry that have proven implementations and use those as they recommend migration based on computing capability. Quantum vulnerabilities can be an issue in the future but a vulnerable implementation would be an issue right now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_______________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Hi Colin, lately XRB has been getting frequently compared to and contrasted with Iota. I was hoping that you could give us your thoughts on the differences between the two and what your general vision for the future of Raiblocks is.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt's flattering to be compared to IOTA, they have a very talented team building ambitious technology. When looking at design goals I think one thing we're not attempting to approach is transferring a data payload, we're only looking to be a transfer of value.\n\nThere are lots of ideas and technology to be developed in the cryptocurrency space and I want RaiBlocks to solve one section of that industry: the transfer of value. I think the best success would be if RaiBlocks was adopted as the global standard for this and crypto efforts could move to non-value-transfer use-cases.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_______________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Do you see XRB becoming the new payment method for commerce. As in, buying coffee, groceries, etc? Do you have plans for combating the HODL mentality so this currency can actually be used in the future of buying and selling?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBeing a direct transactional payment method is our goal and we're trying to build software that's accessible to everyone to make that happen. I see holding as a speculative tactic anticipating future increases and you're right, it's not in line with day-to-day transactions. I think as market cap levels off to a more consistent value the reason for holding and speculating goes away and people can instead focus on using it as a value exchange.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_______________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Are you planning to expand the RaiBlocks team over the next 12 months? If so, what types of positions are you hoping to fill?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRight now we have about 12 people, half core and half business developers. I think this count is good for working on what we're doing right now which is getting wallets and exchanges worked on. Ideally people outside our team will start developing technology around xrb taking advantage of the network effect to build more technology faster than we could internally. That being said we're going to look in a few months to see if there's anything out there people aren't developing that should be and we'll see what people we need to make it happen. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**At what point did you make the decision to make RaiBlocks your full time job? What was the decision making process like?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt was after the week where the core team met here in Austin to brainstorm our next steps. I saw how much enthusiasm there was from crypto-veterans with having a working system capable of being scaled up to what's needed for massive adoption and it seemed the risk needed to be taken.\n\nIt was hard decision to make, working in the crypto and finance is rough and I like using my leisure time to work on inventions. Of all the projects ideas I have this one seemed to have a high chance of success and the benefits of having a working, decentralized currency would be huge.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Hi Colin, what prevents great cryptos like XRB from being listed on bigger exchanges?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt's good to understand where the biggest headaches for exchanges lie: support tickets, operations, and development. If a technology is different from what they already have, that takes development time. If the software is new and not widely run, that's potential operations time to fix it which results in support tickets and community backlash. Adding BitCoin clones or Ethereum ICO coins is easy because they don't have these associated risks or costs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What can the average RaiBlocks-Fan do to help XRB getting adopted / growing / expanding?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think the best thing an average fan could do is word of mouth and telling people about RaiBlocks. More people being aware of it means there's the possibility someone who's never heard of it before would be interested in contributing as a vendor, developer, exchange etc.\n\nGood advertising or marketing will never be able to reach everyone as well as someone reaching out within their own network.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Ray or Rye?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRay hehe. It comes from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stones Lots of people don't know the answer though >_<\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Are you looking at incorperating a datamarket like iota in the future? Given the speed of the network a data exchange for highly accurate sensors could be a game changer.**\n\n**Further more, are there any plans to increase the Dev team in the future? I read on the FAQ you'd like RaiBlocks to be somewhat of a protocol which is a huge ambition. A Dev from say the Mozilla foundation or other could further cement this ambitious project.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTransmitting data payloads is something we probably won't pursue. The concern is adding more features like this could cause us to make decisions that compromise the primary focus points of low-cost and speed for transferring value.\n\nWe can add people to the dev team though I think we'll get the most traction by teaching teams in these other organization how to use RaiBlocks so they can be the experts on the subject in their companies.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Does the actual RaiBlocks version require \"Each node in the network must be aware of all transactions as they occur\" part? This was in the old white paper and is asked here:**\n\n**https://www.reddit.com/r/RaiBlocks/comments/7ksl81/some_questions_regarding_raiblocks_consensus/?st=jbdmgagc&sh=d1c93cca**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf a node wants to independently know the balances of all accounts in the system, it must at a minimum have storage to hold accounts and all their balances. In order to know all balances it must either listen to transactions as they're happening or bootstrap from someone else to catch up as what happens on startup.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**There is no incentive to run nodes. Some people will do it because it is cheap as fuck (as I read an raspberry pie can run it). But I think not many people will do it.**\n\n**1. How important are the nodes in terms of further scaling?**\n\n**2. On which network conditions where the 7000 transactions met?**\n\n**3. What happens if the transactions per day tenfolds but the nodes don't?**\n\n**4. How much better will Rai scale if someone sets up, lets say, 100 nodes with awesome hardware and network?**\n\n**5. How many nodes could be enough for visa level scaling?**\n\n**6. Which further improvements can be made for Rai IF there needs to be other improvements than setting up new nodes? Are there other concepts like 2nd layer solutions planned?**\n\n**7. How will Rai defend network attacks?**\n\n**I know there is an PoW part. But since there a also large attacks on high cap coins on which people invest millions of $ to congest a network..Is it possible that the Rai network will be unusable for several days because of this?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think the out-of-protocol incentives to running a node are under-referenced yet I see them as the primary driving factor for participating as a whole. Node rewards come at the expense of other network participants and in this closed loop the incentives aren't enough to keep a cryptocurrency alive. Long-term there needs to be a system-level comparative advantage to what people are already using for a transfer of value. If someone is using xrb and it saves them hundreds or thousands of dollars per month in fees and customer irritation in delayed payments, they have a direct monetary incentive to using xrb and a monetary incentive in the health of the system.\n\n1) More nodes provides transaction and bootstrapping redundancy. More representatives provides decentralization.\n\n2) The 7k TPS was a profile how fast commodity hardware could eat transactions. All of the real-world limits are going to be something hardware related, either bandwidth, IO, or CPU.\n\n3) The scaling is more related to the hardware the nodes are using rather than the node count. If there was 10x increase in transactions it would use 10x the bandwidth and IO as nodes observe transactions happening.\n\n4) If someone made 100 representative nodes the network would be far more decentralized though the tx throughput would be unchanged since that's a per-node requirement.\n\n5) Scaling to Visa will have high bandwidth and IO requirements on representatives associated with doing 10k IOPS. Datacenter and business class hardware will have to be enough to handle the load.\n\n6) Second layer solutions are always an option and I think a lot of people will use them for fraud protection and insurance. Our primary focus is to make the 1st layer as efficient and high speed as possible so a 2nd layer isn't needed for daily transactions.\n\n7) Defending against network attacks will be an ongoing thing, people like breaking the network for lulz or monetary gain i.e. competing cryptos. If there are attacks we haven't defended against or considered it'll be a matter of getting capable people to fix issues.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Are you open to changes to the name? (Rai)**\n    \n**What are your plans with regards to marketing?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm open to it, people get confused on ray/rye pronunciation, not the greatest first impression.\n\nAs far as timing I think marketing works best after a more user friendly wallet and integration in to more exchanges otherwise we're sending traffic to something people can't use. We're going to start by focusing on the initial adopters which will likely be enthusiasts and going forward work on the next set of users that aren't enthusiasts but want to drive savings for their business through lower payment processing costs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A recent tweet(https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/942961006614945792) from Vitalik Buterin. Could this be a case with testing the scalability of RaiBlocks as well and in reality we wouldn't come close to 7000tx/s?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think he's definitely right, a lot of the TPS numbers are synthetic benchmarks usually on one system. The biggest thing hindering TPS are protocol-specific limits like hard caps or high contention design. The next biggest thing will be bandwidth and then disk IO. Some of these limits can be improved by profiling and fixing code instead of actual limits in the hardware.\n\nWe want to get better, real world numbers but our general opinion is that the RaiBlocks protocol is going to be limited by hardware, rather than design.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Are you planning to add a fiat gateway to the main website and mobile wallet?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf we can make it happen for sure, that seems like a very user-focused feature people would want.\n\nThe difficulty at least in the US is the money-transmitter licenses which are hard to obtain. More than likely if this functionality was added it'd be a partnership with an established financial company that has procedures in place to operate within countries' regulations.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**I saw a post on /r/iota that claims that their quantum resistance is a main benefit over raiblocks. Can you go into detail about this? explain any plans you have to let XRB persevere through upcoming quatum revolution?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think everyone with cryptography in their programs is keeping an eye on quantum cryptography because we're all in the same boat. I don't have cryptanalysis credentials so I didn't feel comfortable building an implementation and instead chose to use one off-the-shelf from someone with assuring credentials.\n\nThere are some big companies that have made small mistakes that blow up the usefulness of the entire algorithm, it's incredibly easy to do. https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/12/ps3-hacked-through-poor-implementation-of-cryptography/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Hello Colin, is any security audit to the source code planned?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe don't have one contracted though both internally and externally this is an important thing people want completed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Do you have plans to radically change the interface of the desktop wallet, and to develop a universal, cross-platform, clean and simple UX design for the wallet? This will be huge for mass adoption in my humble opinion**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI completely agree, we do plan on completely redoing the desktop wallet, both from a UX standpoint and maintainability so UI code doesn't need to be in C++. This could also remove out dependency on QT which is the least permissive license in the code right now.\n\nI write code better than I design GUIs ;)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**It seems like Raiblocks is aiming to be a true currency with it's lacking of transaction fees and fast confirmation times, which is great! If Raiblocks can add some kind of support for privacy then I think it got the whole picture figured out in terms of being \"digital cash\". Do you currently have any plans to implement privacy features into RaiBlocks?**\n\n**If Raiblocks is unable to do this, it will still be a straight improvement over things like LTC which are currently being used as currency, but I don't think it will be able to become THE cryptocurrency without privacy features.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI love the concept of privacy in the network and it's a hard thing to do right. Any solution used would need to be compatible with our balance-weighted-voting method which means at least we'd have to know how much weight a representative has even if we're hiding actual account balances.\n\nTo be fully anonymous it would have to be hide accounts, amounts, endpoints, and also timing information; with advanced network analysis the timing is the hardest thing to hide. Hopefully some day we can figure out an efficient privacy solution though the immediate problem we can solve is making a transactional cryptocurrency so we're focusing on that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Could you provide an analysis on the flaws of RaiBlocks? Is it in any way, shape, or form at a disadvantage compared to a blockchain based ledger like bitcoin? There has to be drawbacks, but I haven\u2019t found any.**\n\n**Do you plan on expanding the dev team and establishing a foundation? Also, how much money is in the development pool?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne drawback is to handle is our chain-per-account model and asynchronous updates it takes more code and design. This means instead of one top-block hash for everything there's one for each account. This gives us the power of wait-free asynchronous transactions at the cost of simplicity.\n\nAfter we finish up things like the wallet, website, and exchange integration we'll be looking at seeing what dev resources we need to build tech if no one else is already working on a particular thing. We have about 6 million XRB right now so we've made the existing dev funds go a long way. If something expensive to build came along and dev funds wouldn't cut it we could look at some sort of external funding.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_______________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How big of a problem is PoW for exchanges and what are potential solutions?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nConsidering how much exchanges stand to make through commission I don't see the cost as a barrier, it's just an abnormal technology request compared to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWe're working on providing a service exchanges can use in the interim until they set up their own infrastructure to generate the work. Other options are containers people can use on cloud services to get the infrastructure they need until they want to invest in their own.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**It's my understanding that since everything works asynchronously, in the case of double spending there is a chance a merchant would receive the block that would be later invalidated and have it shown in it's wallet, even if a little later (1 minute?) the amount would correct when the delegates vote that block invalid. Is there any mechanism to avoid this? Maybe tag the transactions in the wallet as \"confirming\" and then \"confirmed\" after that minute? Is there actually any certain way for a wallet to know, in a deterministic/programable way, at what moment a transaction is 100% legit? (for example if the delegates are DoS'ed I guess that minute could be much longer). I know this is an improbable case, but still...**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYea you're hitting a good point, the consensus algorithm in the node is designed to wait for the incoming transaction to settle before accepting it in to the local chain for the exact reason you listed, if their transaction were to be rolled back the local account would be rolled back as well.\n\nWe can trend the current weight of all representatives that are online and voting and make sure we have >50% of the vote weight accounted for before considering it settled.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Hey Colin, will you eventually have support for a Trezor or other hard wallet?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYea we'll definitely work with companies like Trezor that are interested in being a hardware wallet for xrb. It's just a matter of making sure they support the signing algorithms and integrating with their API.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n________________\n\nEDIT: I'm getting a lot of messages asking me how to buy XRB. I used this guide which was very helpful: https://www.reddit.com/r/RaiBlocks/comments/7i0co0/the_definitive_guide_to_buying_and_storing/\n\nIn short -- buy BTC on coinbase, open up an account on bitgrail, transfer that BTC from coinbase to bitgrail, then trade your BTC for XRB. It's a pain right now because it's such a new coin, but soon it will be listed on more exchanges, and hopefully on things like shapeshift/changelly. After that it will be much easier... but until then, the inconvenience is what we have to pay in order to get into XRB while its still early.\n\n________________\n\nEDIT: BAD SCRIPT, BAD!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Anytime money can flow into low cap coins for fully blown altcoins bull run. Below are the list of top 5 potential 50x in alt coin bull and reasons why chose them.\n\n1) Fusion - It has great tech likes Time lock, quantum swap, DCRM. Working product like Anyswap and new \"be your own bank\" app called chainge is under development. Compared with DOT, NEO, ATOM fusion is highly under valued. MC less than 12m and circulating supply of 66m and Max supply of 81M fusion is already 50X behind NEO, ATOM and DOT. No doubt it can pump up so easily. There is speculation of Binance listing soon.\n\n2) Aergo - Aergo has a great tech with proven 13K TPS. They have solid parnership with samsung and korean government. Apart from that they have parnerships with PWC, Hyundai etc. Their main product Aergo Hub beta gonna be launched soon and mainnet of aergo by end Q1. It will explode like theta anytime\n\n3) ANY - Anyswap is a by product of fusion and competitor to ethereums uniswap. Anyswap is cheap and tokens are listed after due diligence and community voting so no scam coins will be listed here easily. They have more interoperability and bridged many other chains. DCRM usage in anyswap makes it more secured compared to ethereums. Their Native token ANY and its MC is so undervalued their tech and when compared to UNIswaps UNI. Easy 50X token as total supply is any is only 100m and circulating supply is less than 13m.\n\n4) Navcoin - Navcoin MC is less than 11m and they launched privacy protocol on January. It will be implemented on March first week. Compared to Verge, XMR, ZEN, PIVX, FIRO the current market cap of navcoin is so much under valued as supply of navcoin is just 70m with small inflation.\n\n5) Credits - Only 220m supply, 1m TPS which team is trying to prove in mainnet. The price has gone much so down but once they prove their TPS it can do easy 50X. But it's highly speculative.\n\nAll the tokens which I picked up or less than 12m MC. There are few other good ones like QUANT, TRAC but they already seen some good runs so I have excluded it here.\n\nWhat's your thought on my pickings and what will be your picks?",

This platform would require no coding knowledge, and would be tailored to folks who prefer to do analysis within spreadsheets such as Excel and Google Sheets.\n\n**Quick About Me**\n\nI am a former Fortune 500 financial analyst, where I managed two $3 billion portfolios. I've been investing/trading since 2002/2003. If you take a look at my kindle cloud reader, you will see over 100 books dedicated to trading and investing of all sorts - technical analysis, fundamental analysis, daily options trading strategies, value investing, volatility trading, quantitative trading, algorithmic trading, and bullshit trading. \n\nI think crypto is the future, and I believe that it is on an unstoppable path. My ultimate goal is to become a cost-leader in the field, and be tailored towards the individual investor. You shouldn't have to pay hundreds to thousands of dollars for top-notch tools.  \n\n**Features at a Glance**\n\n- Currently over 3,000+ datasets spanning 800+ currencies, and more being added every week (see below for full list)\n- Excel add-in to automatically pull the datasets directly into a spreadsheet\n- Spreadsheet based trading templates (currently technical analysis, will expand to other areas in the future)\n- Advanced charting tools utilizing Trading View\n\n**Databases currently included (updated daily)**\n\n- Bitcoin Charts Exchange Rate Data\n- Bitcoin Charts Tick Data\n- Bitcoin Watch mining statistics\n- Bitfinex exchange rate data\n- Bitstamp USD/Bitcoin exchange rate\n- Blockchain\n- BNC Liquid Index (premium)\n- BNC Digital Currency Indexed EOD (premium)\n- BTC-e\n- BTER historical spread data\n- Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX)\n- Local Bitcoins\n- Poloniex (5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 2 hour, 4 hour, Daily)\n\nAll datasets are available as a **tab-delimited, CSV file**. The datasets are a mix between raw tick data, OHLCV, spreads, mining and economic statistics. They can be used for backtesting, analysis, and charting. \n\n**Investing/Trading Templates and Strategies**\n\n- Ethereum Daily Trading Strategy\n- Williams %R\n- 12 and 26 day EMA\n- Relative Strength Index\n- Moving Average Convergence-Divergence\n- Average True Range\n- Many more to come as I find time to build them out\n\n**On The Horizon**\n\n- Google sheets add-in\n\n**Potential Ideas**\n\n- Giving premium users a partial currency of their choice every month, based on sub price, almost like a savings/investing/trading vehicle\n\nI'm open to answer questions or talk more about the project if there's interest. Hope it helps the traders and investors out there.\n\nJohn",

The token overtook [Ripple (XRP)](https://getblock.io/nodes/xrp/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) and [Cardano (ADA)](https://getblock.io/nodes/ada/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) jumping two spots in the list on Thursday.\n\nBasically it jumped nearly 17% over the past seven days and was last trading around $120, its highest level since late-November. The token also rose 0.4% in the past 24 hours, while the broader crypto market fell around 5%.\n\nThe token surged through the second half of March. It had earlier this week overtaken Terra (LUNA) to take the no. 8 spot in the top 10 cryptocurrencies.\n\nSo we're really bullish about SOL, and actually [recently our SOL node's been updated to v1.9.12 version](https://getblock.io/nodes/sol/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) is that a coincidence?

However, one fast rising business in Russia has so far refused to halt its expansion: bitcoin dealers.\n\nCrypto exchanges, unlike the other financial institutions, have opted not to halt service to their Russian customers. After the ruble's value plunged as a result of US economic sanctions, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong remarked in a series of tweets this week that \"regular Russians are utilizing crypto as a lifeline.\" He claims that shutting down Coinbase's platform in Russia will harm regular Russians, many of whom are opposed to the conflict. Personally, I avoid storing my assets on a exchange since any rule could make you lose access to your crypto. I\u2019m a user of hard wallets but I\u2019m looking for new innovations to store my assets like the Flock Wallet from Parrotly Finance. In times like these in the market, we need to be diamond hands and avoid selling at a loss and hope everything will be peaceful like before.",

So they are looking to buy the Tether USDT stablecoin to store they wealth in.\n\nEven though storing wealth in USDT is not recommended, due the shady rumors against Tether, and the most known one is Tether is not being backed by anything. Then on the other hand, for long term storing of value it's better to invest in projects that gives a return on your investment like Aggregated Finance.

Americans and Russians already proved this theory to be true. Even the laws that apply to crypto may change at any circumstance.\n\nMy humble advice or reminder to you guys is that before deciding to trade in crypto you should be fully informed of the risks and costs associated with the trading. Don\u2019t forget to acknowledge your investment objectives, and risk appetite. Also, know your level of experience and don\u2019t hesitate to seek professional advice where needed. \n\nPersonally as a Matic holder, I\u2019m glad to see Polygon gaining people\u2019s trust and securing investors\u2019 interest in it. I mean simply Matic gained traction as the market rebounded after its recent downturn. Matic was up over 4%, while its trading volume rose more than 13% in the last 24 hours. In a highly competitive space like crypto polygon\u2019s recent magnificent growth in market size surely deserves some praise.\n\nBrothers, it\u2019s not hard to find trustful info and data. But also be aware that not all may be accurate, reliable, current, complete, or appropriate for YOUR needs. No one will accept liability for any loss or damage as a result of your trading but you!

When they lose in a dip, they declare crypto to be a fad. You can simply stake, lend, or mine cryptocurrencies, but this is a completely different procedure. Here are some unusual ways to earn money.\n\n\u2022 Investing in Currency That Pays Dividends\nBuying and holding dividend-paying tokens is one of the simplest and most hassle-free ways to make passive income with cryptocurrency. It's worth noting, however, that not all digital currencies pay out dividends, so do your homework before investing.\nAt the moment, exchanges are issuing the majority of these dividend-paying digital tokens. NEO and Cosmos are two examples of cryptos that pay dividends.\n\n\u2022 Put your money in a savings account that pays interest.\n\nWhile investing in cryptocurrency can help you profit when prices rise, depositing your funds into interest-bearing accounts can help you earn a higher return on your crypto assets. Many platforms now provide this service to investors, and the majority of them also include other features to help you get the most out of your crypto assets.\nSome platforms offer high interest rates of up to 12.73 percent, calculated on a daily basis. Preferred Interest Payout and Token Swap are two features on the platform that allow users to earn and receive in the currency of their choice.\nIf all of this is still too much for you, you can simply use some crypto projects in your daily life and be rewarded with cryptos. You've probably heard of a brave browser that does something similar.\n\n\nPKT Cash is another project similar to this where you can Turn Bandwidth Into Income.PacketCrypt, the world's first bandwidth-hard proof of work, is used by PKT. When you connect your home or office internet to the PKT Network, you can earn PKT Cash (PKT). That's my take and I would love to see if you have a better option that you experienced yourself.",

If you as 5 different crypto investors about mass adoption, you literally won\u2019t be getting any identical answers, simply because we don\u2019t have a clear definition about what this mass adoption is. For me, I believe that when we talk about crypto being adopted worldwide, we need to reach a level where everyone in the world is capable of getting into the cryptocurrency market. \n\nOne of the biggest obstacles that are blocking crypto\u2019s path to this glory is gas fees. I mean most individuals around the world won\u2019t be willing to take part of this technological revolution if they\u2019ll be obliged to pay these crazy gas fees. Probably we\u2019ve got some convenient layer ones that request lower gas fees, like Solana for example. Even though this chain has some issues, but it\u2019s still giving the chance to retail investors and even young NFT artists to pave their way into the blockchain space without having to pay crazy amount in gas. It also has some of the strongest laucnhpads in the market, Solana Prime for example, which is pushing blockchain startups to accelerate in what is being called \u201cthe wild west\u201d of financial markets.\n\nBut what I\u2019m saying is that few are the projects that are doing this job. Eventually, we need more of these if we want this scene to become supported worldwide. I don\u2019t know if this process is going to be accomplished within a year or two, but eventually crypto will find a way, and we will wake up one day realizing that crypto is the new lifestyle for everyone, not only those who are technology enthusiast.",

Looking back, it wasn't the gas fees that kept me out, but the user centric tools that made learning about crypto, and researching project difficult.  It was too disjointed, confusing, and ultimately too much to follow.  Even today as an crypto enthusiast and defi investor, it is like having a second job.\n\nThank god I found Archangel.  They are building a collaborative ecosystem of tokens targeted at providing that one stop shop of for user centric tools that everyone and every project, like Solana and all the tokens listed on their blockchain, can utilize.  The platform for these tools is called Guardian and both the token and platform will be launching very soon.  There is even a pre-sale registration for Guardian this weekend if you're into that kind of thing.\n\nIt is projects like these that will really usher in the fabled mass adoption the crypto market desires.\n\nGood luck investing and stay safe out there!",

Projects that care about their community and keep on an honest relationship with them are the ones to succeed and remain in the market for good time.\n\nOne of my favorite projects is Polygon. MATIC\u2019s team for example, hasn\u2019t failed its community, and what proved that was the implementation of their own EIP update after the community insisted on taking this step. Well it didn\u2019t even hesitate to go for it as the community requested! I even see that Polygon is the most community focused project especially that it is offering us somehow zero fees for swift transactions! \n\nPolygon is truly leading the space with transactions and users. I believe this will benefit the entire space overall. Not to forget the growing fundamentals that seem to also be boosting the overall market sentiment for the blockchain project.\n\nAlso, blockchains now are some of the richest sources of verifiable data. And this is a big step towards improving developer access to datasets, and helping analysts unlock their immense latent value. What\u2019s better than that? So after Polygon\u2019s integration into Google\u2019s BigQuery, one will be able to query their datasets, run analytics and extract insights.\n\nWe have a saying in my native town which says whoever preserves in something, will find what they\u2019ve been striving for.

Thanks to the rapid maturity of the crypto and blockchain spaces over the last few years \u2014 coupled with easy access to secure, performant, enterprise-grade solutions \u2014 cryptocurrencies and blockchain-powered solutions are now at the forefront of the technological and financial revolutions.\n\nWhen bitcoin first came around in 2009 up till 2017, it was always BTC and cryptocurrency is \"REVOLUTIONARY\". And now, the narrative is changing into \"EVOLUTIONARY\" as huge financial institutions are gradually setting up themselves for the future with the blockchain. At first, we had *MicroStrategy* and *Tesla*, before bank giants like *Goldman Sachs* and *JPMorgan, UBS (Union Bank of Switzerland), MasterCard* etc, began to add crypto to their portfolio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThereafter, *NYDIG* \\- a subsidiary of a $10 billion asset management firm, said it would provide crypto buy, hold, and sell services to its clients, and *U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo, Silvergate Capital, Signature Bank,* and *JPMorgan Chase* \u2014 some of the most recognized names in the financial industry \u2014 all began to create or are planning to create and provide their clients with crypto-based products and services; which is exactly what **DeFi Enterprise** entails.\n\nHowever, financial institutions continue to have difficulties adopting DeFi due to challenges posed by Security, Governance & Connectivity which is what ***Unido*** offers. *Unido* bridges the gaps between cryptocurrency-powered DeFi and traditional, fiat-based finance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo key **Unido** offerings are *Unido Enterprise Platform* and *Unido Institutional.*\n\n**Unido Enterprise Platform**:  Helps enterprises to seamlessly and securely manage their assets. It creates bridge for businesses to integrate into DeFi networks while keeping them compliant with their regulatory needs.\n\n**Unido Institutional**: A full-stack crypto bank-in-a-box that provides  customers with easy access to the crypto banking and provides an accessible bridge for their customers to invest and use cryptocurrency and DeFi seamlessly.\n\n**Learn more about the Unido ecosystem here**: [*https://medium.com/unidocore/unidos-enterprise-grade-platform-provides-the-security-scalability-and-interoperability-needed-d1d3ab575b04*](https://medium.com/unidocore/unidos-enterprise-grade-platform-provides-the-security-scalability-and-interoperability-needed-d1d3ab575b04)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think about the change of narrative, what do you think about crypto and DeFi adoption, what do you think about financial institutions in cryptocurrency, what you think about the Unido ecosystem, what did you think about the future of cryptocurrency?\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts.",

Personally and after a 3.5 years period in this market, I\u2019ve come to a conclusion that whatever happens to the market, the quality of the asset you\u2019re investing in is the most important factor.\n\nDeFi is for me among the industries that still have a lot of potential to fulfill. It\u2019s one of the spaces that still have a lot of growth to achieve, and DeFi projects like AAVE, and CRV will be improving decently in terms of market value.\n\nIt\u2019s so easy to make money in a bull-run, especially if one\u2019s investing in memecoins for example. These coins pump really fast, but they\u2019re the first to dump and automatically lose their value whenever a crash happens, and only God knows if these are going to recover from such losses or not.\n\nI think that DCA is one of the most effective strategies anyone can be thinking of when investing in crypto, especially because it\u2019s one of the most volatile markets. So investing for the long-term, hodling, and not panic selling is what we all should be doing.\n\nAnd as I said, most importantly we\u2019ve got to choose our assets wisely. Personally, I\u2019m holding Ethereum, and I don\u2019t think I need to explain why, and BitDAO, which is the largest cryptocurrency treasury DAO we\u2019ve got and it\u2019s investing in DeFi projects, even Redbull racing are holding a bag no lmfao.\n\nSo yeah, I believe that patience is key in this market, and eventually, if we all wait long enough, we will be ending up making money, and DeFi is one of the most promising spaces in crypto if you ask me.",

Even platforms like CoinOvy for example are allowing their users to pay for their subscriptions and purchases using their cryptocurrencies.\n\nYeah crypto still has a long way to go, but we\u2019re surely on the right track.

Debates about Bitcoin have been increasing and the question I\u2019ve been hearing is if it will be able to deliver again the immense gains it has notched since its founding. \n\nI also know many investors who started looking into altcoins taking advantage the money pouring into the crypto space and the metaverse. And others looking more into risky memecoins as it\u2019s becoming one of the most talked about investment opportunities.\n\nAs my wallet mostly holds MATIC, I do feel relaxed honestly. Speaking of analysis wise, I saw a bullish candlestick while examining a Polygon\u2019s chart. If the moving averages take a clear upward direction, this means some of you should be considering opening a long position.\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest here for a second. We agree that MATIC\u2019s price needs a little push to surge, but where\u2019s this push from? I believe it\u2019s from the partnerships made and the new projects launched. Polygon already proved its capability in entering the NFT and gaming sectors, and having some dominance. Polygon Studios is developing play-to-earn games such as Nakamoto or Wonderhero. This will be affecting the increase of MATIC\u2019s value. And if Polygon is able to launch more successful NFT projects, I believe its price value will increase.\n\nMy advice to you is to seek projects with technological achievements and future ambitions.",

            "text": "I'd like to share my brief journey on the PolkaDot ecosystem, which started back in April 2021 (almost one year ago)\n\nWith a shy purchase of DOT, most likely recommended by some random moon-boy YouTuber was my first step on the DotSama's land! It wasn't particularly a good entry, but the hype around it made it look good...\n\nBy then I dint't know much more about what Polkadot was besides being a smart contract platform and I HODL it, and eventually started staking it on binance for ages...\n\nFast forwarding to November, a friend told me about a super cool NFT bla bla bla... I didn't care. Until I l looked at it properly when I started reading Aleksandar Mitrovic's views on the NFT space (Unique Network's CEO) which he often shares on Twitter. That was a turning point for me both regarding NFTs and Polkadot! I use to joke that Aleksandar created a monster: me!\n\nI got interested in Unique Network's take on the NFTs, bringing utility to the table, and that made me follow & support the project and eventually made me want to invest in it! As a bonus it had to token, so it was as early as it gets, a moonshot could be just in front of me!\n\nGreed kicking in! And I wanted to get in...\n\nThe only way to invest in it was through Quartz's crowdloan for a Kusama parachain (which I had no idea what was: neither kusama, neither a parachain) and all of that sounded too complicated to me.\n\nFear kicked in! And so I dodged it but...\n\n...the seed was there and I started learning a bit more about Polkadot, like what a parachain was, what kusama was, what a Layer 0 was (also made me look into Cosmos), how the crowdloans worked, etc\n\nMeanwhile Quartz won the parachain and I got disappointed for missing it's crowdloan, but the truth is that I took the best decision: \"not touching what I don't understand\" and in the middle of the Greed and Fear I mentioned above, the fear made take the right decision and not letting the FOMO affect my decisions.\n\nFast forwarding to 2022, Unique had it's own crowdloan for a PolkaDot parachain, which it also won on a close photo-finish line against Litentry, which I took part as I already had a working and loaded JS wallet with KSM and DOT, and some experience transferring funds and using it, I already knew about the candle system for the crowdloans (which by the way I found brilliant to avoid manipulation), the competitive advantages it has against other smart contract blockchains on Web3 due to substrate flexibility,etc. Long story short I was much more confident and trustful with the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nFrom my research I found that the crowdloan system is a great hunting ground for new projects and it's quite competitive and that makes the projects stronger from the cradle, comparing with other ecosystems.\n\nNow I'm looking into Polkadot's DEXes and DeFi also! Looking into Clover Finance and Acala. If you guys have any tips on the best place to learn and start trying out some DeFi on the space would be much appreciated.\n\nAny random tips and advices on resources to learn further are even more appreciated!\n\nMeanwhile I just wanted the say it's great to be on the Dotsama space! Looking forward to grow wiser (and wealthy) as the ecosystem grows!",

I have been investing in stocks for about a year with pretty decent success, I couldn\u2019t invest big bucks so the returns haven\u2019t been crazy.

During periods when there is either a negative or no big market movement, passive income streams supply some extra cash. With the present environment, this can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Here are my favorite methods of generating passive income through cryptocurrency holdings.\n\n* Using your own private crypto wallet, stake your currency or tokens on your preferred protocol. Validating blocks is a frequent means of contributing to the security of the chain.\n* Decentralized or Centralized Lending via a crypto platform and let them reimburse you for allowing the platform to hold or lock up your crypto. In this scenario, the mechanism is different. You can typically get good rates, but the drawback is that you will need to lockup your crypto for higher earnings. Examples are [Haru Invest](https://haruinvest.com/), Celsius, and Nexo.\n* With the help of LP Tokens. The most profitable, but also the most risky. You can create a pool of token pairings to be swapped by users.\n\nHow about you guys? Tell me your most favorite holdings for passive income with crypto!",

The only work involved is to ensure you have that ADA back in the staked wallet for the next epoch.\nEdit: spelling",

Its government will reverse opposition to cryptocurrencies for the good of Great China\n* Russia will fall into desolation and be disgorged economically and socially in the western world\n* Some benefits such as economies of scale and efficiency from globalization will diminish worldwide, more so outside the EU and the Americas\n* Cryptocurrency's total market capitalization will exceed $150+ Trillion USD.\n\n**15 years of stupendous crypto growth has commenced.**\n\nEpochal challenges and changes have commenced worldwide, sadly caused by a blood-thirsty Putin killing helpless women, disabled, children, orphans, etc\n\nEU, European nations, and the U.K. will spend huge and reconstruct Defence and Energy. Demand and Construction will increase, likewise prosperity.\n\nPrice rises for Oil, Energy, and Commodities will cause inexorable inflationary pressure and inflation will be in excess of 5% in the short to medium term across dependent countries. In the long term the dislocation within, and regression from globalization will result in, almost immutable, inflationary pressures globally, especially in dependent countries.\n\n**And, oh, add decreases in Efficiency.**\n\nThe power, spheres of influence, and economy of China will needlessly fall due to its support of Russia, irrespective of its understandable anti-American perspective. Nevertheless, its stance will come at a net cost to Great China. Thus, possibly throwing away its golden chance to usurp or replace the USA in some respects in world affairs.\n\n**The world needs a prosperous and Great China.**\n\nPutin has atrociously ostracized Russia for at least two more generations after this, with his evil-laden and senseless war. The gross miscalculation of Putin and the Russian Army in invading a peaceful, progressive Ukraine and friendly Ukrainian people is a game-changer in world affairs, world trade, and will cause a realignment in various economies, increase inflation and provide fodder and a massive accelerator for the adoption and growth of cryptocurrencies worldwide.\n\nChina can't save Russia, neither its brain drain nor corporate exodus. It has instead helped to solidify the dominant position of the USD and by extension spur the growth and entrenchment of the world\u2019s sole superpower, the USA.\n\n**Why?**\n\nIt\u2019s now practically impossible to replace the USD in global trade or in Russia\u2019s trade with the world or the USD as the world\u2019s prime reference currency.\n\nThe USD is in widespread use worldwide and it\u2019s backed by a democratic government system, the largest and most liquid bond market, furthermore by higher hydrocarbons production, and by the world\u2019s largest economy with an unparalleled innovation culture, and equity markets, and venture capital sector.\n\n**Still, looking for further proof?**\n\n[The Executive Order on Digital Assets by President Biden on 9.3.22](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/) will accelerate the innovative streak of God\u2019s own country, the USA.\n\nCryptocurrency's prospects have never looked or been this good. Viewed from all perspectives including governmental, inflationary pressures, and huge public awareness, institutional adoption, and HODL; cryptocurrencies will invariably and inexorably rise in value, become pervasive, and a powerful driver for creating prosperous peoples across the world.\n\n**Global poverty will be lower.**\n\nAll told, earthly factors and the gods favor cryptocurrencies and related sectors. I foresee stupendous growth in the total market cap of cryptocurrencies in excess of $150T, powered by endemic adoption worldwide and the proliferation of cryptocurrencies.\n\n[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy Mr. Michael[Ultainfinity Global Group](http://ultainfinity.com/)Founder, Chairman & Group CEO",

The x amount of BTC you can get for your BNB is now worth less in USD then before the BTC move down. Over time this will resolve as the market dominance of BTC falls but currently BTC is too big to fail and would collapse the entire crypto market.",

And please, don\u2019t tell me that they\u2019re free to spend their money however they want. \n\nTake also for example NFTs that made a shock to the society especially after selling ape pictures for 300k$. This got everyone interested to rush towards NFTs as a source of investment and profit, but now statistics prove that this interest has been declining lately. Is it because they found it\u2019s not that easy? \n\nWhile everyone is eager for money, I look forward to practical implications, hoping that NFTs being random pictures will have a beneficial role such as keeping documents safe, or promising real value to owners, even improving ticketing, and contributing in many other good benefits. Same as for cryptocurrencies, instead of just being an ecosystem of investments, be a world of change and exchange.\n\nSo I personally, believe in projects that generate utility, that have a solid community of people being built around similar interests, that have roadmaps and white papers explaining their future importance and contributions. \n\nPolygon Matic is my favorite example, as I\u2019m a massive believer in Polygon\u2019s aim and vision. The amount of growth we\u2019ve seen since 2021 is further proof, and yet the team doesn\u2019t fail to surprise us with new technology. And now many are waiting, so am I, for the new products that\u2019ll be exploding their ecosystem as they claim. \n\nLet\u2019s forget a bit about profit, and focus on utility and benefits for us and for everyone around us.",

I have been a stock investor earlier, but the techniques I used to use there hardly works in this market. But I have to admit that there are players in this market who are making huge profits in every market condition, be it bullish or bearish. Thus, I want to do copy trading because I have recently heard about it from [this video](https://youtu.be/JXvbaQLB0VU). So can anyone suggest me some platform like this where I can follow a leaders' trade and make profits?",

Only if Hedera's price overcomes a couple big resistances and does not break the $0.19 support level will this be possible. Fears of quantitative easing have sent cryptocurrency markets into a tailspin. \n\nThe slump has been accelerated by ongoing geopolitical tensions in Europe, which has reduced the whole crypto market cap by 1/3rd. The price of Hedera coin is currently 62% below its all-time high of $0.57 set in September 2021. \n\nAt time of writing HBAR is currently prices at $0.21 and it's fair to say it will x4 soon, the reason I'm saying this is because only 2 Weeks ago did the HBAR Foundation start a $100M SIF(Sustainable Impact Fund) which is funding innovators and entrepreneurs who are aiming to build the best DeFi and GameFi Dapps only on Hedera.  \n\nRegardless of the fund, I was able to get some Alpha leaks from one of the HBAR Foundation Podcasts with one of the co-founders and it seems like big news is on the way regarding HBAR and Ubisoft, looks like a major gaming ecosystem is being built.  \n\nFinally a lot of NFTs are going to launch on Hedera and this was also confirmed by the HBAR Foundation on the same podcast mentioned above and they including eSports Stars, Luxury Brand and two new eSports gaming platforms launching as well.

But I do believe if you don\u2019t have an understanding of what public or private keys are or basic security topics, it is perfectly fine to do so. The ultimate goal for when you gain a better understanding, is to eventually move your crypto onto your own form of storage. There\u2019s nothing wrong with leaving your crypto in these exchanges; most of them offer insurance coverage on crypto holdings if anything were to happen. \n\nBut, still the risk remains of hacking, so if you do decide to choose a wallet, there are many options. It all depends on your liking and preferences.\n\nYou have many to choose from:\n\nCoinbase Wallet- good for beginners trying to take crypto more seriously\n\nBinance- good digital crypto wallet for trading\n\nKraken- best wallet just because of its convenience.\n\nSquirrel Wallet- a non-custodial wallet that's defi that requires no private key management and no fees at all\n\nMetamask- a perfect beginner secured wallet \n\nTrustwallet- supports thousands of different assets \n\nAnd many many more, just be sure to DYOR\n\nBut at the end of the day like anything that has to do with online accounts, active security measures you take can make a huge difference in keeping your crypto safe too.\n\nWhat crypto wallets are you guys currently using?

The regulator was established last week when the first law to regulate crypto assets was adopted in Dubai.\n\nBinance announced Wednesday:\n\nWe have been granted a virtual asset license from Dubai\u2019s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA).\n\nWith this license, \u201cBinance will be able to operate within Dubai\u2019s \u2018test-adapt-scale\u2019 virtual asset market model as a base for expansion into the region,\u201d the company explained.\n\n\u201cAll licensed VARA service providers will be monitored progressively to open access to the retail market,\u201d Binance noted, adding that in the future, it \u201cwill be permitted to extend limited exchange products and services to pre-qualified investors and professional financial service providers.\u201d\n\nIn the future, I feel that more crypto trading platforms like Coinbase, Tycoon and Crypto.com will also get their licenses. \n\nBinance further revealed:\n\nIn addition to exchange operations, Binance will anchor a blockchain technology hub in the Dubai World Trade Centre.",

There's a million ways to do something and the way that you are currently using is not the only one come on there could always be a better way, or there could always be something you could learn from someone else.\n\nThis is especially the case in the world of cryptocurrency, where they are thousands of ways to do something. For example if you wanted to enter this taking world there are hundreds and hundreds of ways to do it. You could do it on major platforms or on some small programmes. This is also the case where if you wanted to borrow money many platforms will offer it but each will have its own way to pay it back.\n\nFor me I used to trade a lot of small coins, and this is where I learned that it makes a big difference where you actually do it. If you do it on some small and tiny platform than there is a major risk of getting the rug pulled from beneath you. And it has happened to me before. Even if your research the project well there is always the probability that the founders will get tempted by major profits and scam everyone.\n\nAnd that's why some platforms have went as far as to offer literal insurance funds, such as the case with so\u1e37ana prime, because as hard as you vet the coin, you can't trust human greed.\n\nPeople are greedy by nature, and will take advantage of other people just to make themselves some money.",

I am happy that people are pushing for regulation and not ban. Hopefully other countries will see the benefit of crypto, especially crypto trading via Coinbase, Binance, Tycoon, UniSwap and the likes. \n\nThe key takeaway from the session is the group's apparent support of the Finance Ministry\u2019s approach to regulation, with some technical reservations. Experts urged the Ministry to augment the language in its bill related to non-institutional mining, the role of traditional banks, Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures and the illicit uses of crypto.\n\nShould it attune to its own working group\u2019s advice, the lower chamber will be putting its weight behind the position of the Finance Ministry in the heated up debate with the CBR, which promotes a restrictive approach to crypto.",

I\u2019m not going to talk about the cross-border payment simplicity that crypto is offering, or about the financial freedom that is granted to individuals putting their money in this market, crypto is going to have a big impact on the macroeconomic scale. \n\nI literally believe in that. I mean first of all, I think that DeFi is the backbone of the entire cryptocurrency space, and it\u2019s going to be like that for a long time, simply because if you look at it, it\u2019s the most \u2018serious\u2019 space around here. It actually has formed a strong alternative option for individuals to replace banks. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that decentralized finance is going to take over a banking industry that has been here for centuries, but it\u2019s definitely showing a real competition and it\u2019s becoming a reliable investment, especially with projects like AAVE, Curve, or even BitDAO which is holding the largest crypto treasury in the crypto space and is pouring billions into DeFi to grow this space. \n\nThis growth is going to let banks reconsider their performances, and would give the individuals the chance to invest in \u2018better alternatives.",

And how much does news factor into it? Do you look for the rumours to buy and await the news with notifications ready, or are you long gone before that usual sell-off begins - focusing purely on a targeted % increase? Is it almost completely luck, and do you just trade a few at a time to maximise your chances of one being successful?

Even if you only have a small BAT balance, Brave is a good option to use because of its excellent ad blocker. However, the ethos that underpins the brave browser concept is worth noting.\n\nBecause it is true that \n1) you are paid for your attention and \n2) advertisements steal time from your life - and time is the most valuable resource we have.\n\nConsumer-focused cryptocurrency projects exist, in which users can earn a certain amount of cryptocurrency by participating in the network.\n\nA project that comes to mind is Theta.\n\nSimply going about your daily routine can now earn you cryptocurrency. In terms of other crypt, however, this is only one layer. Let's go back one more layer, and this time consider your internet connectivity. What if I told you that you could profit from it?",

In fact I started buying coins people hate on and it\u2019s been working. Right now in crypto sediment matters more than utility in a lot of cases. Your TA is a joke because it means nothing. It\u2019s a waste of time and the whole stock market is rigged so you TA means shit there as well. Get over yourselves nobody here is a crypto prophet. All I see is a bunch of Jim Cramers on YouTube making money off of likes. One that comes to mind would be BitBoy.

Chances are it starts in December or somewhere next year. When everyone and their grandma is bullish and thinks Bitcoin will hit a $million then it will go down. Right now it is very likely going higher though. Nobody knows how high.

Mods did nothing about that, while in the meantime I got banned for creating a post about Navcoin and sharing it on discord. \n\nThey've got their favorites and they got some coins they'll do anything for to keep it unnoticed.\n\nShows why we need decentralized solutions to even stuff like reddit, people with power over others will always use it.",

People do know the answers, they just aren't on reddit and have no incentive to share verifiable information with YOU. People who are on reddit have some of the answers, just not the entire answer and certainly not without a good amount of spin.\n\nWhat is true, is that the metric ton of misinformation and bad interpretations that lead to a lot of bad or circular arguments where no one can verify anything is a symptom of adoption and democratization of the industry. More participants always lead to less truthful consensus and a gravitation towards polarized, reductive conclusions that only get some of the information right while the rest becomes propaganda.\n\nWhat is true, is understanding that reddit and the internet at large isn't a place to receive information about anything. It's a giant billboard and advertising platform.\n\nWhat is true is that anyone doing anything real with regards to TA is making money and not sharing their information about it. Anyone making a truly informed decision about what coin to invest in is more likely to spread bad info in order to position themselves better. Anyone who isn't interested in the \"my team is best\" tribalism isn't posting about \"all coins are good actually\" because there's no point for them to do so.\n\nEven doing your own research relies heavily on whether or not you even know what to research and where to get good information from.\n\nThe internet isn't a greek forum where great minds come to discuss the finer things in life, it's a big game of telephone where some people desperately try to keep the truth alive while others are having fun making sure information becomes as perverted and useless as possible because they think it's funny or nets them profit.",

However, after reading the article, it sparked a question: what if there is a way to counter this?\n\nSince the entire currency is built on solving arithmetic problems using electricity, I understand that mining cryptocurrency requires a large amount of computing power. The power required to find each new coin rises as their value rises and mining success rates fall.\n\nI like the idea where we can stake our crypto and then allocate the returns to social initiatives that aim for carbon neutrality.\n\nHow do you think crypto can help solve climate change?",

                    "response": "Crypto can help climate change in a couple of ways: (1) the Energy Web Token is a project aimed at decentralizing our energy grid. The idea is to provide electricity to homes, businesses, and assets when needed in a more efficient way. I don\u2019t want to get to in depth on this project, but it\u2019ll definitely help reduce our carbon footprint and can possibly get us entirely on renewables. (2) Decentralized carbon credit markets. Right now corporations offset their carbon footprint by buying carbon credits. This is done through centralized dealers. If this system is decentralized it can open the floodgates to many more types of investors and potentially supercharge carbon capture/offsets which should help reduce the amount of CO2 in our atmosphere. (3) NFTs are currently used mostly for art, but their real use case is in real estate or real assets. This is also a bit complicated and there needs to be a regulatory framework built around this to work, but for example, a developer could build an apartment building and then sell it as an NFT. If the building had 30 units, they could divide their NFT into 30 pieces. Whoever buys the NFT would be entitled to the rents received by the specific unit (a dividend). In the context of climate change the same thing could be done for Solar Farms, wind farms, or other real assets. Instead of getting a loan, an investor could hold an NFT auction to raise money for the construction of a solar farm. Buyers of the NFT would be entitled to a percent equity in the asset as well as a dividend from the revenues the solar farm produced. Again, this requires a regulatory framework and is by no means easy to do, but people are already working on it, so it\u2019ll probably happen. (4) This last idea is pretty speculative and I\u2019m not sure exactly how it would work, but you could create a \u201ccarbon coin\u201d that is given to any entity that sequesters 1 ton of carbon. The value of the coin would be based on the current spot price of carbon (~$50-$100/ton) and it could help incentivize people to sequester carbon from the atmosphere. In the same way Bitcoin has a \u201cproof of work\u201d system this token would have a \u201cproof of capture\u201d system. Additionally, you could peg the circulating supply of tokens to the amount of CO2 in our atmosphere in excess of pre industrial levels. Right now that would imply an inflationary supply, but if enough carbon was sequestered, it would eventually become deflationary. Again, not sure how it could all work, but I think it\u2019d be a good idea. (5) other ideas that might help that I haven\u2019t though of yet.\n\nI\u2019m currently a Grad student at Johns Hopkins studying Energy Policy and Climate Change and I\u2019m going to make my capstone project about how crypto\u2019s can help solve climate change. Let me know if you have any ideas that could work or any projects that are currently doing things to improve the situation.",

            "text": "Asset tokenization is the next crypto gold rush, with a potential market of TRILLIONS of dollars that will be on-ramped over the coming years. The hardest part at the moment, as we know, are regulations. Projects working in the United States, in particular, are finding it very tough to get off the ground with all the red tape between them and their ambitious goals.\n\nThankfully there\u2019s a few countries leading the charge, such as Liechtenstein with their Blockchain Act, and the newest frontrunner bringing blockchain to a fully integrated digital economy is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing developing countries: Ukraine.\n\nIn July, [Ukraine passed their digital currency statute](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/01/ukraine-puts-cbdc-on-par-with-cash-in-new-payments-law/) that has been signed into law and will now allow the roll-out of perhaps the world\u2019s first Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).\n\nThey have been working in [direct partnership with the Stellar Development Foundation](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-government-picks-stellar-help-140028973.html) to create the network infrastructure required to pull this off. This is a huge deal for Stellar, that has always been working diligently behind the scenes, and you should expect some big moves from XLM. If the CBDC is in any way related to the public Stellar network, well\u2026 all bets are off.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate Stellar and XLM \u2013 once they are able to prove they can develop one country\u2019s CBDC there are others already lined up. The news is coming.\n\nLast week, the President of Ukraine went on [tour around Silicon Valley](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/volodimir-zelenskij-na-zustrichi-v-san-francisko-zaklikav-pr-70549) in the US to discuss with businesses and tech investors their ambitious plans to bring Ukraine to the forefront of blockchain and digital integration. This included meetings at the highest level, such as that with [Tim Cooke from Apple.](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/president-zelensky-hoping-to-lure-us-hyperscalers-to-ukraine/)\n\nToday the next major step in Ukraine\u2019s journey to be one of the world\u2019s most progressive crypto economies has been [passed by their government](https://dip.org.ua/en/news-of-the-mfa-of-ukraine/ukraine-adopted-a-law-on-cryptocurrencies/). The Virtual Asset Laws will allow a whole host of business and investment integration to take place across all levels of legal and economic requirements. Fully regulatory compliant asset tokenization, with flexibility and direct support for startups and tech initiatives from the government.\n\nLet that sink in for a bit:\n\nRegulatory compliant asset tokenization.\n\nTrillions of dollars opening up to blockchain.\n\nThere aren\u2019t that many crypto projects yet making moves into Ukraine, for whatever reason. Binance is a big one \u2013 they have recently started pushing marketing their hard. Another one is Smartlands, a startup asset tokenization project on the Stellar network that has been diligently building throughout the past four years and is now ready to hit the big leagues.\n\nHere\u2019s why Smartlands stands out from other Asset Tokenization projects:\n\n\u00b7 Legal frameworks will allow direct ownership of assets;\n\n\u00b7 Retail investors will have access to the asset tokens on the investment platform;\n\n\u00b7 Secondary markets and governance flexibility is unlocked by the new regulations;\n\n\u00b7 They have proven themselves in the United Kingdom, with an FCA-licensed building tokenization project already completed.\n\n\u00b7 Multiple asset classes \u2013 this isn\u2019t just about real estate. This is set to unlock asset classes across many sectors, they will be adding SME funding to their real estate listings soon.\n\n\u00b7 Company revenue sharing \u2013 part of the genius tokenomics of Smartlands (and their token SLT) is that ALL revenue received by the company will be converted into SLT *on market* before being split 2/3 to the company and 1/3 to staking holders. This creates both scarcity and buy pressure simultaneously.\n\n\u00b7 The first four properties listed on the platform are seeking tokenization of $18.5 million dollars. That will generate $945,000 of fees as revenue for Smartlands that will be converted to SLT *on market* and then distributed 1/3 to staking holders \u2013 we expect around 10c per SLT to be distributed in the *first round*.\n\nThis is still a small cap project \u2013 currently only sitting on around $30mil market cap and with a total max supply of 7.2mil tokens.\n\nWhat you are seeing here is everything lining up for a fully regulatory compliant start-up, yet to hit the big leagues or even start their marketing proper (they were waiting for the project to be ready \u2013 with these laws it now is), ready to move into a multi-trillion dollar sector.\n\nThey are working in Ukraine with partnerships with Ukrainian investment banks (Empire State Capital) and government-linked initiatives for businesses (Big U), alongside investment management firms (White Asset Management) and full legal representation (Quantum Attorneys). All of it already established. In Ukraine. On day one of these laws being passed.\n\n**$30mil market cap. 7.2mil supply, with staking to begin shortly.**\n\n**You do the math and please DYOR ->** Smartlands.io **/** slt.finance **/** empire-state.capital\n\n**SLT is available on the Stellar DEX (Lobstr app, Stellarterm,** StellarX **etc.) and** Whitebit exchange.\n\n*Get ready for some serious fireworks, this is going to be fun!*",

For simplicity let's calculate the listing fee in dollars also... so that brings us to $945,000 in total *if these first four properties are filled*.\n\nThe entire amount will be converted into SLT *on market* (important) and then 2/3 will go to Smartlands as revenue and 1/3 will be shared with staking holders.\n\nThat gives us around $308,000 that will be shared between staking holders for the first month of revenue sharing (to be paid out on 1st December this year).  \n\nI've presumed that basically everyone holding SLT will stake, because why wouldn't you... so $308,000 / 3,000,000 = 10c per SLT.",

The tether company mints new tethers to swap for the new dollars entering the crypto market.  Then buyers are swapping these new tethers for bitcoin, etc.  But when the crypocurrency market cap goes down, I would expect the relationship to be going the other way.  Money is leaving the system.  People want their old dollars back and give back their old tethers to do this and the number of tethers in circulation should drop.  But we don't see this.  The number of tethers goes up whether money is entering the system (market rising) and the number of tethers goes up when money is leaving the system (market falling).\n\nCan anyone clearly explain realistically how this can be so? :)  \n\nIt smells extremely fishy to me...plus the lack of open accounting of course...",

Sure enough, USDT market cap doubled this last month, despite the total crypto market *contracting* by 27%. This is totally antithetical to their mission to peg USDT to USD. At this point the only reason USDT is being traded at the price it is is because people *trust* that that is the price. If at any point from right now people start waking up, USDT is going to collapse.\n\nBefore someone tries to argue that that sounds like USD; wrong. USD is backed by the world's biggest economy, and enforced by the world's most powerful military. USDT *should* have been backed by USD. It's clearly not. Now it's only backed by farts and dreams.\n\nThere is a caveat here, in that it's likely that people are trading more USDT following the correction over the last few weeks. However the volume does not seem to match up with market cap. In fact, earlier today they just dumped another $650 million into circulation despite trade volumes *decreasing*. As of writing this, USDT is down 1.27%.",

Because of this we expect the number of tethers to go down to reflect this.  In actual fact we see the number of tethers go up massively instead.  This makes me think that those tethers are probably not backed by actual real dollars.  This means that some time in the not too distant future, tether could break, which means any tether holdings would be virtually worthless.  This could be calamitous for many people holding tethers.  According to tether's own conditions of sale, they do not guarantee to exchange tethers for dollars.  Buyers have no leg to stand on.  Plus add into this mix that their auditors have walked away from the company.  These facts can't be anything other than hugely worrying?  ",

To express his devotion to her, he invited their friends to commemorate their wedding on Memo, a social network built on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain that uses the Memo protocol to write permanent and uncensorable posts on the BCH public ledger.\n\nThe couple held a surprise lucky draw for well-wishers who posted their blessings on Memo with the tag #tianli and picked winners using blockchain explorer oyo.cash. Each lucky winner received 10000 satoshis of BCH in their cryptocurrency wallet courtesy of the couple!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/71um518ddpz11.jpg?width=3144&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c03052166eb51a0a53c8082534fc086a7fb32b5e\n\nThe Chat.Chat app made the well-wishing and lucky draw process both easy and delightful. Chat.Chat is a cross-platform gateway to the decentralized world that lets users enjoy instant messaging, decentralized app browser and crypto wallet features in a single app. Memo was previously only available through the web, but with Chat.Chat\u2019s decentralized app browser the couple\u2019s friends posted their congratulations as easily as posting an update on Facebook and had it enshrined forever on the blockchain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wsn6zyyhdpz11.png?width=537&format=png&auto=webp&s=5330b5fd8505a8d88a6fb6240f18fade51af5aa7\n\nThe new couple\u2019s friends had also prepared a high-tech surprise of virtual currency gift cards custom-designed by Chat.Chat. Each card\u2019s design and value could be customized freely as a unique and meaningful wedding gift.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cnumvt4jdpz11.png?width=406&format=png&auto=webp&s=282d8331d9ea4e97f8054662d74fbaf200603324\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8c07le6nbsz11.jpg?width=882&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a3ad1daec1c9b2c919b6f59de87d504512acaf6\n\nTry Chat.Chat [https://apple.co/2DNYc9V](https://apple.co/2DNYc9V) !

However, their propaganda has worked wonders and made many people think the opposite. The fact is, Bitcoin Cash is magnitudes more decentralized in terms of miners, multiple independent development/research teams, etc. There are 3 things that cannot be hidden for long; the sun, the moon, and the truth. Educate yourself and spread the truth. This is the only way to make a stand against misinformation and censorships.\n\nPeople should get the full story of r/bitcoin because it is probably one of the strangest of all reddit subs.\n\nr/bitcoin, the main sub for the bitcoin community is held and run by a person who goes by the pseudonym u/theymos. Theymos not only controls r/bitcoin, but also bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.com. These are top three communication channels for the bitcoin community, all controlled by just one person.\n\nFor most of bitcoin's history this did not create a problem (at least not an obvious one anyway) until around mid 2015. This happened to be around the time a new player appeared on the scene, a for-profit company called Blockstream. Blockstream was made up of/hired many (but not all) of the main bitcoin developers. (To be clear, Blockstream was founded before mid 2015 but did not become publicly active until then). A lot of people, including myself, tried to point out there we're some very serious potential conflicts of interest that could arise when one single company controls most of the main developers for the biggest decentralised and distributed cryptocurrency. There were a lot of unknowns but people seemed to give them the benefit of the doubt because they were apparently about to release some new software called \"sidechains\" that could offer some benefits to the network.\n\nNot long after Blockstream came on the scene the issue of bitcoin's scalability once again came to forefront of the community. This issue came within the community a number of times since bitcoins inception. Bitcoin, as dictated in the code, cannot handle any more than around 3 transactions per second at the moment. To put that in perspective Paypal handles around 15 transactions per second on average and VISA handles something like 2000 transactions per second. The discussion in the community has been around how best to allow bitcoin to scale to allow a higher number of transactions in a given amount of time. I suggest that if anyone is interested in learning more about this problem from a technical angle, they go to r/btc and do a search. It's a complex issue but for many who have followed bitcoin for many years, the possible solutions seem relatively obvious. Essentially, currently the limit is put in place in just a few lines of code. This was not originally present when bitcoin was first released. It was in fact put in place afterwards as a measure to stop a bloating attack on the network. Because all bitcoin transactions have to be stored forever on the bitcoin network, someone could theoretically simply transmit a large number of transactions which would have to be stored by the entire network forever. When bitcoin was released, transactions were actually for free as the only people running the network were enthusiasts. In fact a single bitcoin did not even have any specific value so it would be impossible set a fee value. This meant that a malicious person could make the size of the bitcoin ledger grow very rapidly without much/any cost which would stop people from wanting to join the network due to the resource requirements needed to store it, which at the time would have been for very little gain.\n\nTowards the end of the summer last year, this bitcoin scaling debate surfaced again as it was becoming clear that the transaction limit for bitcoin was semi regularly being reached and that it would not be long until it would be regularly hit and the network would become congested. This was a very serious issue for a currency. Bitcoin had made progress over the years to the point of retailers starting to offer it as a payment option. Bitcoin companies like, Microsoft, Paypal, Steam and many more had began to adopt it. If the transaction limit would be constantly maxed out, the network would become unreliable and slow for users. Users and businesses would not be able to make a reliable estimate when their transaction would be confirmed by the network.\n\nUsers, developers and businesses (which at the time was pretty much the only real bitcoin subreddit) started to discuss how we should solve the problem r/bitcoin. There was significant support from the users and businesses behind a simple solution put forward by the developer Gavin Andreesen. Gavin was the lead developer after Satoshi Nakamoto left bitcoin and he left it in his hands. Gavin initially proposed a very simple solution of increasing the limit which was to change the few lines of code to increase the maximum number of transactions that are allowed. For most of bitcoin's history the transaction limit had been set far far higher than the number of transactions that could potentially happen on the network. The concept of increasing the limit one time was based on the fact that history had proven that no issue had been cause by this in the past.\n\nA certain group of bitcoin developers decided that increasing the limit by this amount was too much and that it was dangerous. They said that the increased use of resources that the network would use would create centralisation pressures which could destroy the network. The theory was that a miner of the network with more resources could publish many more transactions than a competing small miner could handle and therefore the network would tend towards few large miners rather than many small miners. The group of developers who supported this theory were all developers who worked for the company Blockstream. The argument from people in support of increasing the transaction capacity by this amount was that there are always inherent centralisation pressure with bitcoin mining. For example miners who can access the cheapest electricity will tend to succeed and that bigger miners will be able to find this cheaper electricity easier. Miners who have access to the most efficient computer chips will tend to succeed and that larger miners are more likely to be able to afford the development of them. The argument from Gavin and other who supported increasing the transaction capacity by this method are essentially there are economies of scale in mining and that these economies have far bigger centralisation pressures than increased resource cost for a larger number of transactions (up to the new limit proposed). For example, at the time the total size of the blockchain was around 50GB. Even for the cost of a 500GB SSD is only $150 and would last a number of years. This is in-comparison to the $100,000's in revenue per day a miner would be making.\n\nVarious developers put forth various other proposals, including Gavin Andresen who put forth a more conservative increase that would then continue to increase over time inline with technological improvements. Some of the employees of blockstream also put forth some proposals, but all were so conservative, it would take bitcoin many decades before it could reach a scale of VISA. Even though there was significant support from the community behind Gavin's simple proposal of increasing the limit it was becoming clear certain members of the bitcoin community who were part of Blockstream were starting to become increasingly vitriolic and divisive. Gavin then teamed up with one of the other main bitcoin developers Mike Hearn and released a coded (i.e. working) version of the bitcoin software that would only activate if it was supported by a significant majority of the network. What happened next was where things really started to get weird.\n\nAfter this free and open source software was released, Theymos, the person who controls all the main communication channels for the bitcoin community implemented a new moderation policy that disallowed any discussion of this new software. Specifically, if people were to discuss this software, their comments would be deleted and ultimately they would be banned temporarily or permanently. This caused chaos within the community as there was very clear support for this software at the time and it seemed our best hope for finally solving the problem and moving on. Instead a censorship campaign was started. At first it 'all' they were doing was banning and removing discussions but after a while it turned into actively manipulating the discussion. For example, if a thread was created where there was positive sentiment for increasing the transaction capacity or being negative about the moderation policies or negative about the actions of certain bitcoin developers, the mods of r/bitcoin would selectively change the sorting order of threads to 'controversial' so that the most support opinions would be sorted to the bottom of the thread and the most vitriolic would be sorted to the top of the thread. This was initially very transparent as it was possible to see that the most downvoted comments were at the top and some of the most upvoted were at the bottom. So they then implemented hiding the voting scores next to the users name. This made impossible to work out the sentiment of the community and when combined with selectively setting the sorting order to controversial it was possible control what information users were seeing. Also, due to the very very large number of removed comments and users it was becoming obvious the scale of censorship going on. To hide this they implemented code in their CSS for the sub that completely hid comments that they had removed so that the censorship itself was hidden. Anyone in support of scaling bitcoin were removed from the main communication channels. Theymos even proudly announced that he didn't care if he had to remove 90% of the users. He also later acknowledged that he knew he had the ability to block support of this software using the control he had over the communication channels.\n\nWhile this was all going on, Blockstream and it's employees started lobbying the community by paying for conferences about scaling bitcoin, but with the very very strange rule that no decisions could be made and no complete solutions could be proposed. These conferences were likely strategically (and successfully) created to stunt support for the scaling software Gavin and Mike had released by forcing the community to take a \"lets wait and see what comes from the conferences\" kind of approach. Since no final solutions were allowed at these conferences, they only served to hinder and splinter the communities efforts to find a solution. As the software Gavin and Mike released called BitcoinXT gained support it started to be attacked. Users of the software were attack by DDOS. Employees of Blockstream were recommending attacks against the software, such as faking support for it, to only then drop support at the last moment to put the network in disarray. Blockstream employees were also publicly talking about suing Gavin and Mike from various different angles simply for releasing this open source software that no one was forced to run. In the end Mike Hearn decided to leave due to the way many members of the bitcoin community had treated him. This was due to the massive disinformation campaign against him on r/bitcoin. One of the many tactics that are used against anyone who does not support Blockstream and the bitcoin developers who work for them is that you will be targeted in a smear campaign. This has happened to a number of individuals and companies who showed support for scaling bitcoin. Theymos has threatened companies that he will ban any discussion of them on the communication channels he controls (i.e. all the main ones) for simply running software that he disagrees with (i.e. any software that scales bitcoin).\n\nAs time passed, more and more proposals were offered, all against the backdrop of ever increasing censorship in the main bitcoin communication channels. It finally come down the smallest and most conservative solution. This solution was much smaller than even the employees of Blockstream had proposed months earlier. As usual there was enormous attacks from all sides and the most vocal opponents were the employees of Blockstream. These attacks still are ongoing today. As this software started to gain support, Blockstream organised more meetings, especially with the biggest bitcoin miners and made a pact with them. They promised that they would release code that would offer an on-chain scaling solution hardfork within about 4 months, but if the miners wanted this they would have to commit to running their software and only their software. The miners agreed and the ended up not running the most conservative proposal possible. This was in February last year. There is no hardfork proposal in sight from the people who agreed to this pact and bitcoin is still stuck with the exact same transaction limit it has had since the limit was put in place about 6 years ago. Gavin has also been publicly smeared by the developers at Blockstream and a plot was made against him to have him removed from the development team. Gavin has now been, for all intents an purposes, expelled from bitcoin development. This has meant that all control of bitcoin development is in the hands of the developers working at Blockstream.\n\nThere is a new proposal that offers a market based approach to scaling bitcoin. This essentially lets the market decide. Of course, as usual there has been attacks against it, and verbal attacks from the employees of Blockstream. This has the biggest chance of gaining wide support and solving the problem for good.\n\nTo give you an idea of Blockstream; It has hired most of the main and active bitcoin developers and is now synonymous with the \"Core\" bitcoin development team. They AFAIK no products at all. They have received around $75m in funding. Every single thing they do is supported by /u/theymos. They have started implementing an entirely new economic system for bitcoin against the will of it's users and have blocked any and all attempts to scaling the network in line with the original vision.\n\nAlthough this comment is ridiculously long, it really only covers the tip of the iceberg. You could write a book on the last two years of bitcoin. The things that have been going on have been mind blowing. One last thing that I think is worth talking about is the u/bashco's claim of vote manipulation.\n\nThe users that the video talks about have very very large numbers of downvotes mostly due to them having a very very high chance of being astroturfers. Around about the same time last year when Blockstream came active on the scene every single bitcoin troll disappeared, and I mean literally every single one. In the years before that there were a large number of active anti-bitcoin trolls. They even have an active sub r/buttcoin. Up until last year you could go down to the bottom of pretty much any thread in r/bitcoin and see many of the usual trolls who were heavily downvoted for saying something along the lines of \"bitcoin is shit\", \"You guys and your tulips\" etc. But suddenly last year they all disappeared. Instead a new type of bitcoin user appeared. Someone who said they were fully in support of bitcoin but they just so happened to support every single thing Blockstream and its employees said and did. They had the exact same tone as the trolls who had disappeared. Their way to talking to people was aggressive, they'd call people names, they had a relatively poor understanding of how bitcoin fundamentally worked. They were extremely argumentative. These users are the majority of the list of that video. When the 10's of thousands of users were censored and expelled from r/bitcoin they ended up congregating in r/btc. The strange thing was that the users listed in that video also moved over to r/btc and spend all day everyday posting troll-like comments and misinformation. Naturally they get heavily downvoted by the real users in r/btc. They spend their time constantly causing as much drama as possible. At every opportunity they scream about \"censorship\" in r/btc while they are happy about the censorship in r/bitcoin. These people are astroturfers. What someone somewhere worked out, is that all you have to do to take down a community is say that you are on their side. It is an astoundingly effective form of psychological attack.\n\nSource: https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/adam3us/status/633119949943275520\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3hb63g/bip_suggestion_lock_the_blockchain_to_only/cu5v2u2/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3uu3we/bitstamp_will_switch_to_bip_101_this_december/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3uu3we/bitstamp_will_switch_to_bip_101_this_december/cxi370c/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3rejl9/coinbase_ceo_brian_armstrong_bip_101_is_the_best/cwpglh6\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3axnc3/this_is_the_definition_of_fud_how_to_subvert/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3z0pkq/theymos_caught_redhanded_why_he_censors_all_the/\n\nhttp://pastebin.com/1kvuj5bw\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/418r0l/lukejr_is_already_trying_to_sabotage_bitcoin/\n\nhttps://medium.com/@octskyward/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7#.cjuafsypy\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3axnc3/this_is_the_definition_of_fud_how_to_subvert/\n\nhttps://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/bitcoin-roundtable-consensus-266d475a61ff#.g42rjs2ew\n\nhttps://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-classic-targeted-by-ddos-attacks/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5h2wiv/was_theymos_running_a_botnet_in_2007_theymos/?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5fm11b/unullc_is_actively_trying_to_delete_satoshi_from/?\n\nhttps://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/pull/180#discussion_r91823463",

For the memes, it\u2019s called HodlBot. \n\nA few months later, I\u2019m releasing the hosted version of the bot. Now anyone can put their trade-only API keys into HodlBot, and it will automatically trade into the top 20 cryptos. It will also handle monthly rebalancing automatically. \n\n**What does the algorithm do?**\n\nThe algorithm take the top 20 coins and assign each coin a % allocation based on their weighted market capitalization.\n\nThen it caps every coin to be at most 10% of the total portfolio value. Anything above 10% gets redistributed to all the coins below by weighted market capitalization until the entire sum of the portfolio adds up to 100%.\n\n**What\u2019s the minimum amount I need to have in Binance?**\n\n$200 is the minimum.\n\n**How much are Binance transaction fees on rebalancing?**\n\nI simulated monthly rebalancing on a 3 year period, and found that the average transaction fees were 0.26%. \n\nThis can be higher or lower based on how volatile the market is in the future. The theoretical max is 1.2% (if every coin in the top 20 turned over every month). \n\n**How much does it cost?** \n\nFor the first month it\u2019s $1. Afterwards it\u2019s $10 per month.

Prices are, however, free to increase as speculative value is created by the high demand for a low-cost, diversified and automated cryptocurrency portfolio that can be held as a single token\"\n\nThe fact that the token value can be above NAV, means that you're buying into the speculation of the container when you do this, which defeats the purpose of holding an index.\n\nI'm not confident that they can actually offer price protection to never be below NAV. To do so they rely on market arbitrage assuming an unit of C20 is the same as the underlying assets. However, in black swan events I don't think this the case. Traders would place an anti-premium against C20 in a market where they are trying to sell off all my assets to get to fiat as quickly as possible. Worse than losing 1% is waiting for the transaction to take place to get ETH, then to go from ETH to fiat. Traders would also place an anti-premium against C20 if ETH was taking a big shit.",

That choice totally saved my ass, now at least i can buy more ETH after crashed.\n\nThat aside, I also included small features like notification when there\u2019s a **price surge in cryptocurrency within 60 minutes** (or a pump and dump as you call it), or when a coin is listed or delisted.\n\nThis is link for android: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cointrendtracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cointrendtracker)\n\nAnd for dude who use iphone: [https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1443987253?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1443987253?mt=8)\n\nImportant thing to note:\n\n**- If you don't want to login, just choose \" Stay incognito\" option at bottom**\n\n\\- This crappy indie app **won\u2019t require any permission from your phone,** so you don\u2019t have to worry about the safety of your private keys.\n\nI build it by myself with the help of some friends (i\u2019m Major in Computer Programming). I know it just an unknown app, and you may find it so silly but i\u2019d love to hear what you guys honestly think. I love coding useful tools for crypto trader so if you have any idea, but you aren\u2019t able to make it, you can tell me about it via my email and I\u2019ll try to make it a reality if I am able to.\n\nMy email is: [nghia.dt143158@sis.hust.edu.vn](mailto:nghia.dt143158@sis.hust.edu.vn)\n\nThanks for reading until here.

It is nothing which is a solid rock state you can not change.\n\nThis issue makes our and other cryptocurrencies with master nodes appearing to have more than, up to 70% less market cap and makes them appear to be very small cap coins, which is simply not true.\n\nAlso, this has not been done with bigger already existing master node coins such as DASH or PIVX. - So if all master node coins get this bad perk, why does this not appeal for bigger coins?\n\nHere is the answer we received from Coinmarketcap:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/GpPiPhq.png\n\nWe find this decision pretty unfair since it makes our approach to bigger investors and interested people harder than other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWe hope that this issue will be solved soon, since this way it appears that coin market cap is preferring specific coins and losing it's neutral state as an information website.\n\n\n\nUpdate: After contacting Coinmarketcap they understood our situation and will fix all issues that are in our coinmarketcap page.\nMasternodes will stay in the circulating supply - as this makes most sense.",

The highest tier provides 5 years of historical data. this tier has a \"inquire for pricing\". the tier below is 699usd a month... and only provides 1 years of historical data. i.e. https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/pricing\n\nI thought this was highly unfair, decided i would get the data and share it freely to everyone. id prefer not to go into detail about how i got it, they might take it down. \n\nI have all price data, of all cryptocurrencies listed on cmc\n\nfrom: 2013-04-28 \n\nto: 2018-08-04.\n\nlink to download:\n\nhttps://www.filedropper.com/5yearscmchistoricaldatafrom20130428to20180804\n\nI'm using sql server, so i tried to provide a db agnostic as possible way to share this data, so i dumped it into a csv file. this is the table structure. Table name is CmcHistoricalPriceData\n\nId | CoinId | Symbol | Date\t| Open | High | Low | Close | Volume | MarketCap\n---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----\n835561 | 1 | BTC | 2013-04-28 | 135.3 | 135.979| 132.1 | 134.21 | 0 | 1500519936\n\n- The CoinId looks odd, but its used as a foreign key to other tables im using, mainly the coins provided via the free v2 api https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v2/listings/. full api here https://coinmarketcap.com/api/\n\n- the Id field is just a primary key that increments by one for each new listing. i added non clustered index for faster retrieval, but eh, surprisingly it only ended up being 835561 rows. so not really any needed, the index uses the coinid and date.\n\ni did some spot checks on https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/, looks to be accurate.\n\nthis data is useful for back testing, and general market analysis, if you use the R programming language you can do some interesting stuff with this data. \n\nAs for their highest pricing tier with 5 years of historical data, there might be a richer data set, but i think the data provided in my table is enough to do most analysis. the only other data that would be useful would be exchange data, looking for arbitrage opportunities etc.\n\nOnly disappointing aspect of this data is that it doesnt go back past 2013, not sure how to go about getting that data.\n\n\nHope you guys like it. \n\n- If anyone who knows R can quickly show me how to build a set of the % difference of marketcap changes between the peak of mcap and the bottom historically, id really appreciate that, hope that question makes sense.\n\n- here is the table, the types are not correct e.g. decimal, but it does the job. just run it if ur using sql server, or u can prob run it thru an online converter for ur db of choice. if you can suggest a better decimal type for this kinda data id like that too.\n\n\nscript:\n\n    /****** Object:  Table [dbo].[CmcHistoricalPriceData]    Script Date: 2018-08-18 1:24:11 PM ******/\n    SET ANSI_NULLS ON\n    GO\n\n    SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON\n    GO\n\n    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[CmcHistoricalPriceData](\n\t[Id] [bigint] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,\n\t[CoinId] [bigint] NOT NULL,\n\t[Symbol] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,\n\t[Date] [datetime] NOT NULL,\n\t[Open] [decimal](30, 12) NULL,\n\t[High] [decimal](30, 12) NULL,\n\t[Low] [decimal](30, 12) NULL,\n\t[Close] [decimal](30, 12) NULL,\n\t[Volume] [decimal](30, 12) NULL,\n\t[MarketCap] [bigint] NULL,\n     CONSTRAINT [PK_CmcHistoricalPriceData] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED \n    (\n\t[Id] ASC\n    )WITH (PAD_INDEX = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON) ON [PRIMARY],\n     CONSTRAINT [IX_CmcHistoricalPriceData] UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED \n    (\n\t[CoinId] ASC,\n\t[Date] ASC\n    )WITH (PAD_INDEX = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON) ON [PRIMARY]\n    ) ON [PRIMARY]\n    GO\n\n    ALTER TABLE [dbo].[CmcHistoricalPriceData]  WITH CHECK ADD  CONSTRAINT [FK_CmcHistoricalPriceData_CmcCoinListing] FOREIGN KEY([CoinId])\n    REFERENCES [dbo].[CmcCoinListing] ([CoinId])\n    GO\n\n    ALTER TABLE [dbo].[CmcHistoricalPriceData] CHECK CONSTRAINT [FK_CmcHistoricalPriceData_CmcCoinListing]\n    GO\n",

Raising two kids is no joke because I have to be a mother figure aside from being their dad. (I know it sounds ironic that it's the girl ditching the guy not the other way around but this is real life you know. I cannot do full-time jobs because I had to tend to my kids. After all, they're just toddlers. So that's where I got the idea to invest in cryptocurrencies. I was pretty glad of the fact that I can invest in something and earn a passive income without doing too much and I like it because I get to watch my kids and still earn money by purchasing crypto and just by holding long-term. I have earned here and there and After 2 years of investing in all sorts of cryptocurrencies, I happen to land on this Crypton (CRP) one day and being the adventurous guy, I decided to give it a try.   \n\nAt first, I was pretty worried because not that many people that I know use it but I had a generally positive experience with their platform surprisingly and like all other coins, it can be an extremely lucrative endeavor if done properly. We all heard those stories of people making huge profits in a very short amount of time or with a little amount of money they've invested that skyrocketed throughout a couple of weeks to extreme highs and made staggering returns. And I am one of them. Well, I'm not a millionaire but I can say, my life is beyond comfortable at this point. I'm trying to resist the temptation of bragging about how much money I own because, the problem with bragging about how much money you\u2019ve made from Crypton could make you a potential target for robbery, ransomware, or kidnapping. The good thing about them is that all transactions are strictly confidential. So nobody knows who you are or where you're from. I almost feel like a paid shill sometimes lol. I know people gripe about crypto shilling but it's honestly the only way I'd consider purchasing altcoins at this point. . While others continue to trade without the fear of venturing out or even losing, others are being patient, cautious, and reluctant. Although I do respect both points of view, only the risk-takers are getting high returns. As what people call it, High-risk, high returns.",

She doesn\u2019t want Putin or Americans to have access to privacy through crypto in all reality.  \n\n\nConclusion:\n\n* No centralized entity can be trusted at all.\n* Those in power are doing everything they can to stop crypto from mass adoption.

It allows it to list any asset with a chainlink price feed. Currently is has over 50 crypto pairs, and 10 Forex, already making it the most diverse leverage exchange whether DEX or CEX. And it will be listing stocks by months' end and commodities after that.\n\nIt is a crypto with an actual product/service that people pay to use, generating a large revenue stream for the protocol.\n\nThe best part is, not only does it distribute almost all of the revenue it earns, it is also very deflationary. It's well known that short term leverage traders on average lose more than they earn, and the net losses buy back the $GNS tokens on the open market and burns them. In a little over a year it has burned 25% of the supply, while providing huge yields to LPs (often in excess of 100%, and always over 60%). \n\nThe GNS tokens form the liquidity backstop to the protocol, and are a necessary part of the ecosystem. Not just a shitty inflationary governance token with no use case. \n\nOnce the gTrade platform is fully built out with commodities and indices, (estimated Q4), the team will begin work on a decentralized casino and betting platform that will utilize and reward the same $GNS token. \n\nWith many countries banning CEXs from offering leverage trading, there is a vacuum that needs to be filled. Like it or not, leverage trading is a huge percentage of daily crypto volume, and these users are not going away just because their governments don't allow it on centralized exchanges. \n\nNot many projects can boast $2.72M distribution of revenue in the month of March (annualized at $32.94M) at a tiny $80M market cap, while burning 25% of supply in a year.",

Mainly because here in Australia you can no longer leverage on binance and because the kucoin futures liquidation threshold can be as bad as -30% in some cases.\n\nOne problem this doesn't suffer from that leverage on a CEX does is the the lack of any price slippage - which is precisely why CEX liquidation threshold can be as bad as above for a newly launched coin (pretty sure it was DOGE that they did me dirty on when they first launched it). You lose your liquidity so fast when people are able to take out $1m positions on just 10k if its not synthetic. \n\nThe trade off is that its too early to say whether it will be able to offer lower leverages as efficiently - if it could capture the 1-5x market that would be incredible. If in future it proves  able to without the risk being too big there would be a huge market of potential CEX traders who don't want to KYC for whatever reason (as I imagine tax liabilities of borrowing 900k on a CEX vary between places).\n\nAlso, not gonna lie finding this project also spurred me into learning a decent base of solidity and javascript to run a liquidation bot, which has been a frustrating but rewarding exercise. Pretty grateful as nothing had actually pushed me to learn about crypto stuff more deeply than the very basics until it even though Id been into crypto since 2013 and now I feel like I have a reasonable handle on web3js, how ethereum/polygon and its transactions work etc.",

It uses smart contracts on a blockchain to make data exchange safe and secure, and I believe this will have an impact on our daily lives.\n\nI believe that if we can share some material anonymously on the blockchain, there will be no restriction and information will finally flow freely.

I find them being talked about here on reddit or facebook but it's taking too much of my time researching and learning new stuff on crypto on how to play to earn.\n\nWhat are your favorite play-to-earn crypto games and why?",

A new project gets launched and pumped up by a couple whales, speculation gets amplified, personalities are hyped along with their projects, and a few months down the line it usually all ends up in tears ($TIME, et al.)\n\nBeyond all the mess and fake hype, I believe there are innovative projects with ironclad fundamentals that tend to fly under most people's radars.\n\nAmong my new favorites, I'm bullish on [Zebec.io](https://Zebec.io) , a continuous settlement protocol that allows for real-time continuous streams of payments. Also very bullish on [liquality.io](https://liquality.io), a multi-chain \"superwallet\" with one-lick atomic swaps that makes Metamask (and their support team) look like hot gabage.\n\nCurious to find out what under-the-radar projects everyone is currently bullish on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease, no nft's or \"node\" projects\n\nEdit: Ty so much for all the suggestions. Lots of great projects to go through!",

Since the project allows developers to use XRD's defi libraries and the Radix Engine to build their own DApps, it opens up a world of innovation from people with ideas. More developers contributing, more potential to find gems. I like to use Scrypto (to learn for now) for accessing Radix engine because it is written in Rust language and documentation is just \\[chef's kiss\\].\n\nThis is just an oversimplification but it is very robust and I'm definitely looking forward to that project's future and the developers using their ecosystem like myself.\n\nAnother gem which is very new but will offer another neat wallet idea is RoboInu Finance (RBIF). The person who started it was an ex-Google developer, and passed to an experienced software project lead, and she's been kicking ass, in my opinion. Since I'm really into community and collaboration, RBIF's culture has captured my interest. It's not about hyping, it's not about pumping, but about nourishing the community by continued support and offering solutions. RBIF has a special place in my heart. lol\n\nThe 2 products/solutions I'm very interested about are their flagship RoboWallet and RoboLaunchpad (which aligns with my interest for collaboration).\n\nRadixDLT is already a mature project while RoboInu Finance is still very very new. I think financially, you can gain a lot from RBIF in a year or 2. ;)",

The complexity of entering the crypto market for someone who has no knowledge about it. They will be the Apple of crypto. Make it so that a 75year old can easily be aware of projects and invest in them. \n\n2. Whale manipulations. How frustrated are we as retail investors to see whales draining profits over and over again. They hurt the chart. Well, Coyote Coin is implementing a Harpoon Tax to discourage whale dumps. If any wallet tries to sell more than 5% of the previous 24hr trading volume, the sell tax gets ratcheted up to about 33%, with 10% of that getting redistributed to holders.",

It\u2019s true that crypto is giving us an opportunity to achieve financial freedom, as its true that only a few will get there. So keep your focus on the process if you really want the result.\n\nMy ultimate advice is never to invest in a project without reading its whitepaper, understanding it\u2019s purpose (what problem does it aim to solve), and evaluating its team. Believe me when I tell you, a bit of research makes a huge difference. \n\nTry to relatively diversify your wallet, and rebalance based on each coin\u2019s performance, especially that the market differs if it\u2019s bullish or bearish. Keep in mind that to make money in crypto it\u2019s not about getting every call correct. In fact you can make a number of bets, and only hit one winner to still come out ahead.\n\nPersonally I am a huge fan of technology, that\u2019s why my wallet is based on MATIC tokens to hodl. Polygon has proved itself to be a top notch technological project trying to improve and shape the ecosystem. But of course that hasn\u2019t stopped me from owning other coins, some resting with MATIC, while others being traded kind of on a daily basis.\n\nManaging a portfolio isn\u2019t simple, so start small. Believe there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. With experience start expanding your wallets. Don\u2019t forget you need to keep your track on what\u2019s happening in the market and following up on the daily news.\n\nLet me know if there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve missed. Hope you all be satisfied peeps! Goood luck!",

I am looking for projects that will be here in 10 years and have a real life impact. There are plenty of projects that have this potential, but that gives you the next dilemma: What is the project really worth?\n\nComing from a Finance background I like to value a project, which is sometimes difficult in Crypto. Just saying the price will go to $1, $ 10 $1000 or the Moon is not a real metric I would like to rely on.\n\nI have been using a Discounted Cash Flow model, which can be applied on projects with enough transparency, actual business model and something that could be considered as a Cash Flow. This way I can make a rational decision in investing.\n\nAs an example I applied this to **GET Protocol** (NFT Ticketing Project), each ticket sold uses a certain amount of $GET, while the supply is capped. This usage can be seen as a Cash Flow and used in your model. This gives me an intrinsic value of about x10 todays price. For more on the project I can recommend this blog:\n\n[https://medium.com/coinmonks/nfts-are-much-more-than-just-jpegs-99c20cd963fd](https://medium.com/coinmonks/nfts-are-much-more-than-just-jpegs-99c20cd963fd)\n\nThat being said probably there are other models/methods out there that also work good in crypto. Curious to hear what you guys use to value a project?",

The game isn't out yet and 2. It's actually *very* close to launching so it's not all speculation on vaporware.\n\nThe name is from their partnership with AAVE. Aavegotchi's the NFT's have been out for about a year now, but the actual MMO game launch isn't until this year.\n\nThey are doing an alpha/psuedo-airdrop starting March 31. If you hop on the server and play around, there will be random drops of the 4 elements/coins, you can in theory make some free cash during this alpha. If you don't own a \"gotchi\" (your player/character) by then, no worries you can borrow one for free. This alpha is more of a giant stress test then anything.\n\nAgain, I don't want to sound like shill, so I'm happy to disclose I personally am interested in this project and have a gotchi. However the game isn't out, so it could very well all not be worth it. I'm just as clueless as you and everyone else \ud83d\ude42\n\nBut, the timing here aligns with you wanting to get started in the space. This is a unique one in that it starts end of this month, so you can be there from the beginning if you want to experiment. Cost can be free if you're willing to borrow, or you can grab an Aavegotchi or land plot now.\n\nHappy to answer questions, hopefully this post doesn't read as me trying to just shill a project for my own benefit.",

So I bought in with the whole 15000 and took a huge loss now down to 7-8k . so in reality I really am at a loss for 2021 but from what Coinbase reported it just seems like I am up . I want to get your guy\u2019s input on how to go about filing and if I have to pay for the profit on the first 5000 I got . Any advice or pointers are much appreciated thank you all !",

This is subjective and not the holy grail, if the project is like good a lower or higher mcap is welcome!\n\n2) Should have solid(verified) partnerships.\n\n3) Super strong team(product, engineering, marketing) with solid credentials(educational background, experience, etc.)\n\n4) Do they really need the blockchain? Couldn't they offer their services without a token?\n\n5) Solid Tokenomics \n\nNot necessary but good to have: If the project has active user base/active app/active product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's bring it on!",

More information will be released on this soon, but think of it as the crypto version of YouTube, but you can see all teh video reviews you want for the projects you are most interested in from verified influencers!\n\nHerald is a communication tool within the Guardian platform where project admins can post comments and updates for their entire community to see.\n\nThere is another compentent that will provide other projects full bios for marketes or influencers so they can connect with the right ones for their projects!  This will also link directly to any videos uploaded into BrainStem from these verified influencers.\n\nAnother component, Token Strength, looks at numerous variable within a token to calculate an overall strenght score so you know if it is a strong buy!\n\nThere will be a section that displays features tokens and coins based on their overall scores.  A section where new projects that haven't lauched can begin building a profile BEFORE they launch so you know what you are buying on launch day.  Another section showing the top news stories for the day pulled from numerous crypto sources.\n\nThere will be a risk analysis component that will analyze your potfolio and provide a risk assessment, complete with recommendations of where you can reduce risk.  And since this is embedded with the Guardian platform, will link you to those projects within BrainStem so you can learn more!\n\nThe Scratch Engine will be embedded into Guardian to hanlde your NFT needs.\n\nThere will be a DeFi section, linking you to Defi solutions for buying and selling.  Initially, this will be linked to FEGex, but there will be more in the future.\n\nThere will be a security component (that will also be it's own token) called SpyDr (pronounced spider).  Not much is know about this yet, however initially released information is it will present auditor services from the best in the business, liquidity and asset locking providers, and insurance carries who offer specific services for crypto.  How about a visual depiction of etherscan, bscscan and others to show you how a contract is disbursed?  Phase 2, maybe a little scam hunting and malicious wallet identification?\n\nI'm sure I missed some, there is so much!  Basically, everything you need, and never even thought you need, all wrapped up into one integrated platform so you can take control of your crypto portfolio in ways you never imagined.\n\nAnyway IMHO, I think it is worth a look!",

There\u2019s a shit ton of them, especially here.\r  \n\r  \nWhen it comes to how much you should start on, honestly, it doesn\u2019t matter. Your $300 is already more than enough. It is best to start small since you\u2019re just starting and you\u2019re exploring. On my end i started with 200 and just kept hodling.\r  \n\r  \nAlso, since you\u2019re going to trade, learn to stop/prevent losses and do risk management. When I first started with crypto, I kind of regretted going into it without completely preparing myself so do your research and be cautious.\r  \n\r  \nAlso, if you\u2019re in the US, then you\u2019re going to have problems with binance since it will require you to use a VPN. I would suggest going for Coinbase Pro (though I\u2019m using coinbase since it works in where i am right now). With trading, I think you\u2019re already good with those two. I\u2019m familiar with both Bybit (through their sub r/Bybit) and I\u2019m currently trying to figure my way on Kraken.",

At that time unknown malicious attackers stole over 153 000 ETH after discovering a bug in Parity\u2019s multisig wallet code.\n\nThe projects affected by the attack were Swarm City, Edgeless Project, and \u00e6ternity. Recently, with the help of the three projects, SimpleSwap identified 500 ETH sent to the platform from one of the attacker\u2019s wallets. Our team acted quickly, stopped the attacker from exchanging and removing the funds, and returned the stolen funds back to Swarm City, Edgeless Project, and \u00e6ternity.\n\nSimpleSwap is proud to create an honest and trustworthy environment within the crypto community. We know that only through cooperation and mutual support can we create the open financial system we all dream of.",

And the products they have match this expectation, in that you do get the exchange, promotion of new coins, trading competitions, DeFi, etc\u2026 but also you can just use the card for cashback (paid in CRO), maybe use their Earn for interest on stablecoins (1:1 fiat conversion using TrustToken, current rates around 6-8% without lock-in) and that\u2019s it. Looks like your bank with a debit card and a savings account. \n\nCRO itself isn\u2019t a revolution in blockchain technology, but I expect the price to reflect success of the company. Also after the launch of their mainnet and burn of 70 billion coins earlier this year, crypto.com will have to buy back from the open market to keep up with rewards (which I expect to go down over time). \n\nTbh when I saw the Matt Damon commercial a few weeks ago (just prior to current pump), I realised how hard they want to invest in on catching newcomers and make them feel *safe*, which is crucial in a world where crypto is still mainly viewed as some expensive and obscure investment for insiders or a dark web scam. I don\u2019t see any other crypto-based company getting Hollywood endorsement anytime soon.",

Part of what I\u2019m saying with ADA is that selling now while it\u2019s down 50% from ATH and putting it into something that is up 50% in the week is not the best investment strategy in my opinion. That being said, some people may have more agressive investing/trading strategies than me, so I won\u2019t tell you not to invest somewhere else.

Essentially the idea here is that in addition to storage nodes (people providing extra space on their hard drive, for example) other projects can be used to provide storage as well.

Rastaswap's token is called $Rcoin. The purpose of Rastaswap is to tokenize stock options of cannabis related companies and start ups, so that more people can invest and access all over the world. Cannabis is restricted in some countries so stocks are not an option either, but this opens the door for the rest of the world to invest in an exponentially growing cannabis industry!  \n\nICO price is .11 USD, there will be a maximum of 160million tokens. Finally, holders will receive daily dividend rewards of either $ETH $BNB or $CAKE at 4:20 PM (amount depending on how much you hold and daily volume). The Telegram community is great too! Only place to go is up!!!!!!!!",

Upfront taxes go in part to funding an investment pool and community members make proposals and vote on investments to make with that pool.  Distributions of gains are made to holders when an investment is liquidated and the person that proposed the investment gets a 2.5% additional share of the profits.  \n\nIt is a really unique business model with a great community and a lot of potential.  It is very early.  Market cap is under $15mm and they are just kicking off marketing.  They are also about to roll out a fiat in-ramp.  I think there is a lot of upside here.",

The reflections are 8% and more than half the circulating supply has been burned already.\nThey have an anti-whale feature that dosent let whales sell more than 0.125% of the total supply in one transaction.\n\nThey also have a Buy-Back and Burn function. When Buy-Back and Burn is enabled, the contract purchases EGC from exchanges, which creates a green handle, then permanently removes those tokens from circulating supply (burn) which makes the $EGC token scarcer over time. More than 1.7% of tokens have already.\n\n**Utilities and dapps**\n\n\nSome utilities include Nft Marketplace, Nft Lending, Content Creator subscription platform(think Patreon, YouTube, and onlyfans combined. The platform will increase volume and hence reflections). Utilities all coming within next few months.\n\nSupported Exchanges like Bitmart, Lbank, Bibox and many others to coming in the next few weeks.\n\nticker: EGC\n\nreddit: r/evergrowcoin\n\nwebsite: evergrowcoin.com\n\nreflections dashboard: app.evergrowcoin.com/dashboard\n\n***\n\nCompared to almost all other deflationary coins the returns are insanely higher.

This is a common misconception that a coin that is cheap has more upside potential but it just isn't true. Look at the market cap to get an idea of it's growth potential.\n\nFor example SHIB is $0.000037, while also being the 13th largest by market cap.

Platform is ready to start in December in Latam countries. \n\nYou can stake it on Bancor or Uniswap\n\nRentible will also add a marketplace for rent metaverse properties. \n\nMarket can insane!

                    "response": "Investing: I hate investing and wasted so much opportunity just holding eth. Most alt crypto investments should be shorter investments than many other markets. This is cuz of the cheap valuations VC and ppl get into. This in turn causes lots of sell pressure and volatility in the markets when the project does become successful. So I always recommend to invest for the short term cycles in crypto. That being said, the best thing YOU can do is look at the\u2026 \n\n(1) Solana ecosystem compared to eth\u2019s. You\u2019ll see that impressive backing usually means very lackluster price action. Early backers can get in at nutty cheap valuations, only for the token to list at 10x+ the seed Val. This is also accelerated by FTX listing then as Perps, only adding to the sell pressure, as it allows shorting. With funding/backers, it\u2019s best to look to community projects with little or no VC backing (rmrk, spell, ohm). These coins can do many multiples just because they is no coordinated selling, usually. That being said, each of these coins is down like 80% after going up 100x. This is weak conviction selling coins to greater conviction. This is actually healthy for markets, as there are ppl like me who turn 9k into 300k on spell; quickly becoming a sizable % of my portfolio, thus allowing euphoria to only accelerate the fear or losing riches. Healthy.\n\n2.) don\u2019t lie to yourself. My biggest mistake was letting others convince me of something. Ofc you gotta have ppl like coin bureau to act as a stepping stone in crypto. However, in peak euphoria and froth, there\u2019s toxic ppl wanting you to support the next world reserve currency and will hit you with massively flawed logic. My favorite was ohm. If you don\u2019t know what ohm is, it\u2019s a treasury-backed asset. If the coin goes below treasury, then ppl could arb it, in theory. The coin traded to 20:1 treasury backing at peak, with dumb money chanting \u201cits back!\u201d\n\nThink about that for a second\u2014 ppl were lining up putting their lifesavings into a project that only ensured a possible -95% drawdown, *IF* the team dissolved the funds to token holders. The team decided to invest that money similar to a VC (decided in November mind you). So now the risk-free treasury is now a risk-on liability. Peaked at 3k, now like $60. Good project honestly, but ppl lied to themselves BIG time.\n\n3.) Knowing the landscape. So for this Ill talk on top L1s. Eth was king in 2020, if you were on another chain, then you missed. That being said, BNB caught massive attn going into 2021. This was due to their grant program or liq. Program (forget what it\u2019s called). This saw massive liquidity and valuations on a chain with WEAK fundamentals, but cheap fees. This became a narrative. I missed all of this, but I fortunately was a naive matic believer. I saw a Reddit post about getting on the chain and using Quickswap, so I did just that. Bought $500 or so of quick at $20. Got a nice return, but sold a bit early. Matic is fundamentally stronger than BNB, but still weak, especially at the time. Another coin I was big on was Avax. I replicated my quick trade on avax, and bought png cheap. Did my research, learned about subnets and horizontal scaling that other chains like matic cannot do. This built my conviction in avax, so when they announced their liquidity program, I was then able to ride it from ~$20 to $110. Ditched my png for a better dex token (joe) and made a good return on a sizable chunk of my portfolio.\n\nWhen moving into dapps, it\u2019s also important to consider landscape, tokenomics, and tech of L1 layer. I\u2019ve moved away from betting on lending, dexs, meme coins on strong chains, and now bet on novel projects building on these layers.\n\n4.) since I invest in cycles, it\u2019s best to look for hype imo. No one knew what ohm was at launch, but I could have easily have got a 5x out of it just based on how strong the community is. \n\nSpell and the abra projects had insane projects and potential, BUT I\u2019m absolutely convinced the convinced it was Dani\u2019s memes and [shitposting](https://twitter.com/danielesesta/status/1467912789985529863?s=21) that drove hype and community.\n\nSolana has insane marketing and backers. While it\u2019s ecosystem did absolutely shit, the token itself thrived. This is because of the dynamic for new investor wanting cheap fees and low valuation bags. I never entered with lots of conviction, and I think I\u2019m actually in the red 5k from sol NFTs lmao.\n\nAvax was hyped cuz of the $600m-1b rewards program.\n\n5.) learn to admit when it\u2019s over. We\u2019ve seen massive pumps into 90% pullbacks with the majority of those tokens never again reaching half their ath many times in crypto (Ltc). This is why I invest in cycles, because the dynamics change so fast. Many top L1s cannot compete with the next wave of L1s (look into celestia ;), so learn to cut your dreams early before the market does.\n\n5b.) learn Ta. It\u2019s not voodoo, nor a prediction thing. However, you can learn market structures of what\u2019s likely to be bullish/bearish based on price action (pa) alone. Ya tracks the markets emotions, and Crypto is nothing but emotions cuz 99.9% of ppl don\u2019t kno why they\u2019re buying crypto, they just know number go up. \n\nI\u2019m not gonnna larp and act like I sold top. I mainly trade lowcaps, and a brief bear from top coins can be a GREAT entry, but I\u2019m down like 50% from ath and many great traders are. I grew bearish when btc formed an ascending wedge in the 60ks. I did break structure to 69k, but ultimately slumped back into the wedge. Being a eth head, I watched eth battle BTC\u2019s negative pa, but it ultimately consolidated just ABOVE 4k support. This shows weak buy pressure, so I exited with an average sell of like 3800-4200. Held my rmrk from $70 to $16 tho lol some are just too strong\n\n[free ta course that I started with](https://youtu.be/q7BVTJol0IA)\n\n6.) all business is done on Twitter. I have my own project and almost only reach out to ppl via Twitter. Telegram and discord are the next most important apps to use.\n\nReddit is for the pigs, and the pigs go to slaughter. That being said, there are LOTS of big brain ppl on the chats, none of which are the top comment or post.\n\nTwitter ppl:\n[cobie- most popular trader](https://twitter.com/cobie?s=21)\n[Andre](https://twitter.com/andrecronjetech?s=21) and [banteg](https://twitter.com/bantg?s=21) are devs at yfi\n[hentai avenger- turned 20k into nearly 100m](https://twitter.com/hentaiavenger66?s=21)\n[CL- cat](https://twitter.com/cl207?s=21)\n \nLastly* follow [DarrenLau](https://twitter.com/darrenlautf?s=21) he has a telegram with all of the crypto news from that day. This is what will turn you into a wolf\n\n6.) fail. And admit your dumb (see my last comment lol)\n\nI was a scared little kid in 2020. I bought the fear of corona, but was hesitant to enter crypto with force in defi summer 2020. 2020, I got a 3x with my money, but suffered a 60% drawdown. I learned Ta and fundamentals going into 2021. From Jan to May I got a 5x with a 50% drawdown, then that summer to present I\u2019m up 10x AFTER suffering a ~50% drawdown. \n\nNow as crypto ppl lose more and more hope the lower we go, I\u2019m gaining more and more hope. The lower we go, the more multiples do do on the next leg up\n\n7.) learn narratives. Ohm fork, gameFi, L1s. This is best done via Twitter and pattern recognition\n\n__________________\n\nI spent 5.5yrs in hs and didn\u2019t graduate college. Now I got a team of writers with way more impressive credentials than myself. I learned more than them because I took the risk and was curious.\n\nAlso, someone said day trading is worthless, well they just cannot control emotions. I turned 1.5k into 13k day trading for a month, but it\u2019s exhausting and boring. I was also using leverage, and that Carrie\u2019s immense risk. One of my old bosses went from 5m to 250k in a month from leverage. Low caps I think are safer\n\nHope you enjoyed. I spent like a hour and twenty",

If I see alt coins start pumping 30% a day and breaking new highs then I know i\u2019m right and btc has topped and they will all dump together after that retrace. If btc starts pumping away again and alts keep bouncing around down here then I am wrong and btc might break new highs again. \n\nBut i don\u2019t think i\u2019m wrong. \n\nAs for what specific altcoins will pump and do those 1000%+ moves, my guess is xrp, xlm, zec, xmr and those other altcoin projects that have not pumped yet, but have risen out of their bear market resistance levels and still holding above them. Many of the older coins slammed into their previous all time highs and then came back down, but still making higher lows since the summer. Those are a good signs. Those are the coins that show accumulation. \n\nThe alts like doge and shib or projects like sol or avax and these newer ones that pumped over 1000% in a little less than a month in my opinion are sliding into their bear markets. And even if they do see a new high, it won\u2019t be life changing percentages from this point, we simply missed the boat on many of those. \n\nThat being said, the whole market is in a huge bubble, we\u2019re playing with fire here.",

According to research, billions of dollars have been spent on digital marketing up to date, and the aftermath of Covid 19 has pushed that number even higher, as most businesses have resorted to online marketing and have found that digital marketing is critical to their success.\n\nComing back to the crypto field, we only have digital marketing, so its critical to the success of any project. In most cases, digital marketing benefits marketers and organizations handling it at the expense of buyers and consumers. So, in my search for a digital marketing company that benefits both the vendor and the consumer, I came across UwUFUFU, which is a digital marketing company in the crypto space.\n\nBefore I talk about UwUFUFU, I'd like you to know that everything I'm going to say is based on my own research, so you should do your own if necessary.   \nUwUFUFU, as I previously stated, is a digital marketing project, and it combines digital marketing with P2E (one of the good sides of crypto right?).  It accomplishes this by displaying advertisements in the form of socially engaging quizzes, and rewarding users with NFTs, lootballs, and FUFU (its native token) for completing a specific number of quizzes.\n\nFrom my explanation above, I hope we can see that brands will benefit from displaying their advertisements on UwUFUFU and consumers also get to earn from going through the adverts, so it's a win-win situation for both parties.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of the project is that it has integrated DeFi into its system and currently has two staking pools with 3000% and 1800% APY respectively, also it presently has over 120K active users which are playing quizzes on its platform, and that shows that it's a project that is loved by many.\n\nThis little information that I've learned that there is a chance for a quick earn with FUFU - So I\u2019ll keep you posted with what happened to my staking FUFU-folio.",

Whether in the form of decentralized exchanges, lending and borrowing of different asset types, or through insurance products, DeFi is evolving and expanding swiftly to mirror the traditional financial services ecosystem.\n\nOne of the most appealing aspects of adopting blockchain technology to reinvent banking is the potential for the market to become permissionless and accessible to anybody. Another appealing feature is the notion of composability, which allows anybody to combine current DeFi offerings to create a new one. The scalability of such a network, which is basically made up of blocks of interconnecting components, implies that future financial inventions and demands may be readily constructed on top of it and connected, all under the control of smart contracts.\n\nThat's how we have a Kaiba DeFi Lightning Chain (KLC) which is a fast and cheap blockchain based on PoA consensus that is 100 times faster and 1000 times cheaper than ETH. It is not only 100% compatible with ETH, but also cross-chain compatible with other major blockchains.\n\nThe conclusion is that this new form of decentralized financial technology may eventually have an impact on the future of centralized finance entities, with DeFi potentially being seen as an alternative that's cheaper, quicker, and more relevant.",

The perception that crypto is just for a privileged few in the population is now absurd, thanks to the 4dot ecosystem and many other investment opportunities that have since been developed. The new technologies allow anyone and everyone with capital to invest in and benefit from crypto.\n\n\n$CCF has to be one of the most important \"not-so-new technology\" in the blockchain ecosystem (Cross Chain Farming). It has been a quiet mover in the FaaS industry over the last few months, but it deserves every crypto trader's attention.\n\n\nIt's a Defi 3.0 FaaS protocol in which investors profit from a yield farming treasury controlled by the protocol. Members are rewarded in the form of dividends and reflections, just like other investments. It's also the Binance Smart Chain's first fully audited Cross-Chain DefI 3.0 FaaS DAO. As a result, investors can keep track of their tokens in real-time.\nThis isn't the only ecosystem that can thrive. Other projects include D3 Protocol, 4dot Launchpad, and Hera Capital, which is set to launch in 2023. Previously, you would have to spend a significant amount of time studying and analyzing these markets before making any investment, but that is no longer necessary. Enter the new player, the 4dot ecosystem, which is essentially four players in one.\n\n\nThis ecosystem integrates all of the other ecosystems and invests wisely on behalf of its investors, making Defi available to everyone.\n\n\nThe system is also affordable, simple to use, and extremely secure to all of the investors on board.",

They combine derivative products that imitate an underlying asset like currencies, indexes, stocks, bonds,\ncommodities etc. in simple terms, they allow investment firms to leverage on multiple financial vehicles instead of focusing all their investments on one asset.\n\nCrypto synthetic assets employ the same methodology giving subscribers exposure to a range of different component assets without needing to hold the underlying asset. This is fantastic because a crypto investor doesn\u2019t have to leave the crypto ecosystem to hold assets from fiat\ncurrencies (e.g United States dollar or British pounds ) to commodities like gold and silver by holding tokens that are mapped to the value of these assets. \n\nTo make investing in crypto synthetic assets a lot easier you can subscribe to protocols like konstellation.tech\u2019s alkemy.

You may have a security team as far as the large scale is  concerned. They simply CANNOT find every single bug under every single  nook and cranny.\n\nWe something in  the cyber security and hacking world called hack value. The term is self  explanatory but It's basically the value of a target and what you can  get out of putting time and effort that's going to go into hacking it.  Crypto technology is an incredibly valuable for a hacker because of just  how much money is involved. Using Polygon as an example, they launched  their bug bounty program and a bug was patched that could have cost the  chain MILLIONS.\n\nIt's sad to see  how little these massive projects worry about their security when  there's literally billions of dollars involved. There's a little quote  that says \"You don't buy a screen protector before your screen breaks.\"  but as far as security is concerned we MUST be pro-active. There is not  only money at risk but reputation.\n\nFor  the sake of conversation, I'm not sure if there area any security guys  here but I've been consistently hearing that none of it will matter when  ZK comes out and that it's impenetrable. NOTHING is impenetrable and  unhackable, nothing. Thoughts?",

But based off my research so far, it appears that choosing the right digital wallet is an important step in this whole process. Is there an overall wallet that people tend to go for? Or is it down to personal choice? Kinda like a bank account? Either way, hopefully this is allowed here, but any advice you can provide would be much appreciated. I kinda feel like if i don\u2019t start soon, I\u2019ll miss the boat and I don\u2019t wanna be left metaphorically and financially stranded in the future, as it were, whilst everyone made sensible investments and choices now, you get me?

They are of particular importance for citizens of emerging economies: Play-to-Earn communities (so-called Gaming Guilds) amassed hundreds of thousands of people in the Philippines.\n\nLast but not least, rocketing popularity of the Play-to-Earn segment should be attributed to a corporate-driven aggressive promotion of metaverses.\n\n[There are three easiest ways to earn in P2E depending on who you are: a trader, a gamer or a blockchain enthusiast](https://getblock.io/blog/how-toearn-with-play-to-earn-basics-of-hottest-crypto-trend-right-now/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v3ax2mp2exr81.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdb71651c16039d87cc9586199b73613628b9076",

It uses a play-to-earn approach rather than the standard \"play-to-win\" concept that has been popular in the gaming industry to provide monetary incentives to gamers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy biggest concern about recent P2Es and GameFi is pretty much the entirety of the game not being completely on-chain like it's supposed to be, meaning 90% of the time it's centralized because frankly, I don't think there is a chain capable of handling the txns any game needs or the high density of players; Let's say a crypto game kicks off and becomes \"viral\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really doubt any current chain is able to handle this amount of heat, except maybe Hedera which has yet to build a Gaming Ecosystem simply due to the lack of adoption and funding this past couple of months. But I'm not really worried about since I've been seeing the crazy amounts of money the HBAR Foundation has been spending on Devs and innovators to help build DeFi and GameFi in their economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere do you see GameFi headed in these couple years? Do you think it will explode in the near future or will it fall behind regarding the quality of games and not to mention the speed of on-chain txns affecting the game's perfomance or general security.",

I actually have no idea how any of this stuff works. I got a fake budget of 1 million dollars and the project lasts 8 weeks. What crypto should I invest in (choose at least 4-5 different ones) and how much each? The goal is to earn as much as I can at the end of those 8 weeks. At any point during the project, I can change only one of the things I invested in by selling it and buying something else in its place. Only one change allowed! Thank you so much!",

                            "response": "> EDIT: fill your bags while it\u2019s on SALE!\n\nNot for me... right now it is still at my first \"sell targets\" (I bought around $15, my first deposit was on 2016/07/25) and my sell targets were $500,  $2000,  $20,000.   So far, I've successfully exercised all of them with no regrets. I missed the BTC boat and promised myself I would not miss the ETH boat; I'm glad I didn't.   \n\nSince then, I've lost some value in  crypto scams,  lost some in shitcoins (like ZLA, KEY), gained some value in good bets (ADA, DOT) and been able to pay some \"real life\" debt with some of the gains.  \n\nRight now \"zooming out\" at the ETH chart it is clear to me that the \"right\" price is around sub $1000. Why? It was at around $500 back in November last year before this \"bull wave\" started. Back in 2017 we saw the same pattern with the bull run, going up from $40 to +$1000 and then down to around $200.  Yes, there is value that \"sticks\" after the bull run, and this time is different (more institutional money which \"sticks\" more), but still, nothing justifies an increase from $500 to $2000  or even $1500.  \n\nThe good news is that ETH \"touched\" the $4000. For me that means it is feasible to get there. We will get there, in time.  That's the reason why you only put in what you can afford to lose.  You do not count with that money, if in 5 or 10 years it gives you a 10x or 100x increment then you won.",

I want everyone to know how Poloniex treats customers who invest money on their website, and that they shouldn't be trusted, this issue has been going on for more than 5 months now, and with such an amount it's very, very wrong to ignore me and freeze my account, no organization should do that.\n\nI've trusted Poloniex with my money and this is what I get in return, a frozen account and no explanation of why my funds are held. This is very unprofessional and they're bad for the crypto community. Everyone needs to know about this and stop exchanging on this shady exchange.\n\nProof of funds/account: https://i.imgur.com/9UfZ4P8.png\n\nPlease everyone, help me get this viral and let Poloniex know that their reputation will be ruined if they don't release my funds.\n\nThank you everyone, I appreciate it.",

I still think the way the website is designed is best for my needs over all other exchanges, but there's no way I'm putting my money at risk with those fools.\n\nI used their ticket support system during these \"DDOS attacks\" too because of a delayed transaction that seemed stuck. Took two weeks to hear anything and by the third week, the transaction finally cleared. The ticket was never closed or finalized, and I never bothered following up since I got the result I wanted. Needless to say, I will never trust my money with Poloniex and honestly, with the amount of other options available no one should either.\n\nReally looking forward to decentralized exchanges. Until then I would recommend using Shapeshift.io over any exchange if you're not trading daily.",

                    "response": "Polo has always been fairly sketchy. Many of these exchanges seem to put very minimal back into investing in their product. Tbh man I would stick with one of the US certified exchanges...coinbase, gemini, etc. If your trading I would keep bulk of your assets on one of them and use either bittrex or Bitfinex (if you think they have security down path). I have delt with support from Bitfinex, gemini, and bittrex. The fastest by far(same day) was Bitfinex. Bittrex and Gemini also resolved my issues in a timely manner and have both upgraded their ticket systems to help. I guess what can we all do the help? Are there any mods from Polo on Reddit we can bombard for you?",

That's not to say I'm not going to buy back in, but it's hard to take away from Reddit's bubbled crypto subreddits, whereas \"everyone\" has the same hive mind mentality. Here's one that's not. Anyways.\n\nI sold out. =\\, Today's movement (+) I don't think is sustainable. I think everything is at systemic risk right now. Unlike before, this is a global sell off, and not just a concentrated one (coupled with next weeks stock action).\n\nPeople understand Mt Gox happened. There is billions tied to this market, so that is also going to put a stop on buys for awhile.\n\nThe hype is dying down. People aren't getting crazy moon gains, so less people are wanting in, collectively. People are getting burned by the crazy price swings - so all the grandmas, aunts and uncles who got in Dec, sorry for your loss. There was a ton of ignorance from people that came in from Dec as well.\n\nFurther, there is a systemic risk, and it starts and stops with the exchanges. I know I keep touting this horn, but I think Bitfinex sort of fucked this entire market with monopoly money.\n\nI don't see the market immediately recovering. A modest bump, but then back down again. At best I see Eth getting to and staying sideways $1300 for a month. At worst, $450-500. It really depends on how people treat this market, and what the hell the SEC is going to do with Tether. This is going to be a long played out process. I could be wrong, so I will stay humble.\n\nPsychology has alot to do with it, and with each passing day - people find out more and more about this market.\n\nEdit - I was forntunate to begin making the vast majority of my sales Dec31-Jan14, before everything went kaboom. I still have about 30 in the market. In VEN. Just incase anyone is wondering. **I don't want to see people burned, just because they took Internet advice from a collective group of strangers.**\n\nEdit 2 - **I've seen this hive mind mentality before with Wall Street Bets, /WSB/ and AMD stock. Moon moon moon. No, it didn't go to the moon.** It crashed, and its just gone sideways ever since everyone jumped on it via Reddit - and said 'hodl'. From $15.50 to $9.00. In that time, Intel (and nVidia*) has outperformed AMD's stock. Lisa Su memes, everywhere. That is this, all over again.\n\nEdit 3 - **Even the top post in this subreddit, is Leonardo DiCaprio saying he aint going the fuck anywhere. XD. Its the top post. Do you know from that meme, how many people are actually going to subconsciously follow that advice? It's sad.** If Facebook interferred in our election, Reddit is a transference of that same viral-attitude to get quick rich scheme.\n\nEdit 4 - While we like to stick to Crypto, just be aware of what's happening in the broader markets as well.  https://www.marketwatch.com/story/buckle-up-this-ultimate-bear-chart-signals-a-pivotal-moment-for-investors-2018-02-05\n\nI did find this quote to be cynical, funny (unforntunately relevent) at the same time.\n\n\u201cBull markets don\u2019t die from old age,\u201d says Guggenheim Partners CIO Scott Minerd. \u201cThey typically get shot in the head.\u201d\n",

Even sentiment can be quantified, which you don't show evidence of here, and the fundamental reason why I don't believe you.\n\nYour logical fallacy is...an inverse-bandwagon?\n\nYou claim that the fact everyone is on the bandwagon means that the bandwagon is going to fall off a cliff. What evidence do you have to prove that? What evidence, reasoning, numbers, analysis, or fundamentals do you have for any of your price targets? Why don't you think the market is going to immediately recover? Why only ethereum? How can you say without a doubt that tether is a fraud? Why are the exchanges going to fail with 100% confidence? What is the systemic risk here, and what is your evidence?\n\nI can actually relate to quite a bit of your sentiment on a personal level, but if even one of your answers to the questions above was, \"I just know\" or \"I have a feeling that this will happen\", then you're just as bad, if not worse than the shillers that you're hating on.\n\nP.S. The stock market corrected today because bond yields climbed to the point where yields have actually become attractive for the first time since 2013, investors are starting to come back into their normal risk profiles from being pushed out so far due to aggressively expansive monetary policy, the modestly large selloff this morning triggered panic selling, exacerbated by algos going haywire, and will not transform into a bear market with a 99.95% confidence level.",

There is a lot of attention, and a lot of eager expectation, but as far as reality goes the practical usability of blockchains has in some cases even regressed due to rising transaction fees.\n\nI expect 2018, at least within the Ethereum space that I\u2019m best able to speak about, will be the year of action. It will be the year where all of the ideas around scalability, Plasma, proof-of-stake, and privacy that we have painstakingly worked on and refined over the last four years are finally going to turn into real, live working code that you can play around in a highly mature form in some cases on testnets, and in some key cases even on the public mainnet. Everyone in the Ethereum space recognizes that the world is watching, and we are ready to deliver.\"\n\nTHE WORLD IS WATCHING,\n\nAND WE ARE READY TO DELIVER.\n\n",

OP took his profits and got out. That's commendable no matter if Bitcoin went to $100k or $1. Getting into something, making a profit, and getting it out is nothing to cry over even if other people made more on it.",

Exactly what was happening \"back then\" before it all went bust.  When the dust settled, it was the companies that actually had plans and customers and great management teams that survived.  \n\nI'm in for a bit, but not more currently than the old \"no more than I can afford to lose\".  Friends who are in for a lot more keep telling me I'm too scared and not taking it seriously enough.  My thought is if it's really that big of a game changer, there will be more than enough upside to augment retirement nicely.\n",

I should've sold into BTC and I wanted to, but I got too greedy. It dropped hard, and BTC skyrocketed every since. Painful.\n\nMentally, I went insane for 2 days. I couldn't eat or sleep and I had a hard time talking to people. I had a big ah hah moment where I realized it's just money, and in the end, life is what you make it. Money doesn't make your life. If you give money too much power over your life, it can destroy you. People kill themselves over money problems. It's not worth it. Life is great, and money is just one small aspect of life. Life should not revolve around money.\n",

Yes, the video titles are worded like clickbait but they're legit. I did some of what they did (on a much smaller scale, obviously; ie - when they buy $10k of a coin of a new or up-and-coming project, I'll put 100$ into it or something like that) and turned a pretty decent profit by literally just buying low, holding, and selling high. Rinse and repeat. Take profits (or cut your losses), reinvest half in something else that has big things coming or decent potential, wait for profit or an unacceptable amount of loss.. that's investing. Trading, I don't really do but those youtubers have tutorials and tips on if you'd like.",

Now they want new coin that they market as \"one that will bonk Doge\" to create meltdown in the crypto market and spark the need for regulations.\n\nHere's some of that involvement illustrated here: [https://i.imgur.com/IYS33Yu.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IYS33Yu.jpg)\n\nThere's no way all these people decided to just get into some coin out of nowhere without big plan for it. There are even \"mysterious donors\" in their community that literally buy billboard ads in NY (see: [https://i.imgur.com/1Uzc5MG.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/1Uzc5MG.jpg)) and there's more and more coming in Australia, Germany, even in London or freaking Dubai, this isn't organic!\n\nSomething like that doesn't just pop up organically, it's all planned. Nothing is like it seems. We need to spread awareness of this to whole crypto community, because it's not only attack again the Dogecoin, it's attack on whole crypto itself! Also, there's Bill Gates.\n\nPlease help me spread awareness about this.",

Take trading presumptions \n\n2. Backtest them (maybe find something out-of-the-box so you don't add too much on your plate while learning trading)\n\n3. See what has potential\n\n4. Work on that\n\nOnce you have a strategy you can automate it easily on CLEOone (solid backtester too), Haasonline, or something else depending on what you need.  If you don't want to use builders add coding to the things you need to learn.\n\nIt will take more time but you will be lerning a craft instead of stumbling in the dark.",

This is not only due to their lack of understanding of the crypto scene but as well as a lack of relevant resources to help them identify pump and dumps to avoid them and/or take advantage of them. To help prevent that we are building a pump and dump watchlist to highlight potential pump and dumps. \n\nFor a start we are using trading volume surge as a key indicator of possible pump and dumps. The logic is that a sudden trading volume surge can only be justified either by a very big news or a pump-and-dump. This list can serve as a trigger point, and you can easily jump on twitter and verify if there were any news justifying the exponential trading volume.\n\nHere is how we are currently identifying PnDs: we identify the cryptos with average daily volume between $100k and $2M, and 24h volume at least 5x above their average daily volume. \n\nYou can see this list in our beta tool here https://beta.digitalassetdb.com. We have a section on the page called Exponential volume surge. \n\nPlease have a look and share your feedbacks in the comments. \n\nWhat do you think of this approach? \nWould you add other selection criteria to make this list more accurate?\nWhat value do you see in maintaining a pump and dump watchlist since the crypto space is extremely volatile anyways?\n\n*** \n\n**Edit 1:** We now show all assets with an average daily volume above $100K and 24h volume at least 5x above their average daily volume. \n\n**Edit 2:** Reports are now generated every 5 minutes.\n\n**Edit 3:** Added Exponential Surge by Price\n\n**Edit 4:** We have made lot of new update over the past few days. We posted about it in the part 2 of this post [here](https://redd.it/7m0sc7) let us know what you think.\n\n**Edit 5:** Exponential Spikes are now based on weekly average price and volume instead of monthly previously.",

This means it still has much more room to grow and make profits.\n\nHowever to reach mainstream status, we need the mainstream market to start accepting full on crypto payments, and we know that\u2019s not happening anytime soon. So we have to integrate a form of traditional kind of payment through these crypto credit/visa cards.\n\nI\u2019m currently using one of these crypto cards from Zpae and they\u2019re actually very convenient and I also get cashback on my crypto so that\u2019s cool. If more companies keep doing stuff like this crypto will soon charge into the mainstream market. Just wait and see.",

That may play to your advantage if you just never mention it again.   \nBut heaven FORBID anything should happen down the road legally, that crypto may be considered assets which you may have to be shared with her eventually regardless. Maybe not now, and legislation is iffy around what crypto is but one day, it may be clearly defined, and the time you bought this crypto may fall in a precarious time frame.   \nI'm not sure it's worth the money transferring it to another wallet if it's as expensive as you're projecting if ultimately she forgets about it and it's safe.   \nI don't know your situation. And know I am not harsh in this because there is so much we the internet don't know. And not saying you haven't tried it cause I don't know.\n\nBut as a sign of good faith in you doing everything you can, take what you would spend on transfer fees and spend it on you two or your kids now for a vacation or therapy or bills. Life is too short to be saving for a better day sometimes when something can be done today. \n\n\u2014best of luck to you all.   \n\n\nP.S. \n\nIf your OP is suggesting crypto and money were the cause of the problems, spend the crypto and money on what you need now. Money is secondary and you can also get more later. \n\n  \n\\*not a lawyer. This is a non-judgmental brainstorm and not financial advice",

            "text": "I don\u2019t know how people don\u2019t see this yet: NFTs are the next bullrun. It doesn\u2019t matter what they are now, they are what teams and big normie companies are looking to develop. That means they are SEVERELY undervalued in all aspects. What they will be worth at the end of the bullrun will be a LOT more than they are now. DeFi is dead. Think of it like this: DeFi is like investing in Oil--a lucrative but very established market with some very big players, NFTs are more like crypto in that they are severely undervalued, a new market, and the mainstream is now looking to get into them and learn about them meaning their ROI is going to be way bigger, it\u2019s absurd. Sure, you may get out worse off if you can\u2019t actually figure out who is good to invest in. Perhaps their marketing plan or business model is shit. Maybe you\u2019ll pick a loser and be a bagholder, but overall you\u2019re looking like you\u2019re going to make a good stack if you get in when and where you should.\n\nPlaces like Bake, Rari, OpenSea (though no token) are making a ton of money and this shit hasn\u2019t kicked off yet. Think of it like this. NFTs are computers back when people thought computers were for loser nerds who couldn\u2019t get laid. Now everyone has a literal computer in their fucking pocket they spend most of their day on. A lot of NFTs now are shit, sure, but they\u2019re growing, more big money is being poured in, and they very well could normalize into regular retail markets--and we are going to make sweet bank as they grow and get bigger and better and the market grows. The problem I see with A LOT of them, Rarible being a good example, is they are just undiluted shit. Like you can actually take a shit, take a picture of it, and put it up as an NFT. Partnerships and filtering needs to take place for quality to emerge. Nevermind, the fact that there is a ton of IP infringement going on in these places. Do you think legal suits are going to bode well for the valuation and long-term functioning of some of these companies? No, and content creators know that and the good ones don\u2019t want to associate with companies who actively promote behavior that destroys their livelihoods.\n\nI am getting in early on something at ILO, that means a shit ton less than it will be worth even one week from now when the 10x FOMO happens. If you want to get in, go for it, I don\u2019t give a shit. Be poor, be rich, do whatever\u2014DYOR, etc, etc. But the reality is you don\u2019t get a better moonshot when you get in at ILO/ICO. If this thing even gets a slither of a slither of the NFT market it is a literal 100x. Inb4 the comment section is filled with \u2018NFTs are a meme\u2019, \u2018NFTs are going nowhere\u2019, \u2018hur durr I can just printscreen your NFT and it\u2019s mine\u2019\u2026 yeah, cool: don\u2019t care still making my easy 100x.  Maybe they are the dumbest thing on the planet, it doesn't matter they're going to get some normie ape and I'm going to ride their ape brains from branch to branch until they ape so hard the centrifugal force of a branch sends me into orbit to the moon. Edit: Oh yeah, forgot to mention this NFT is doing partnerships/vetting, so the huge issue of IP infringement I mentioned, and content creators not wanting to work with them, or their NFT market being a sea of literal junk and crap is not going to happen.\n\n**Investment:** **Seedswap (SNFT)**\n\nAt ILO, roughly under a cent per token, and with a supply of only 100m it\u2019s going to go to 10c easily  after ILO ends\n\n**Website:** [www.seedswap.io](http://www.seedswap.io)\n\n**The telegram is on the website**\n\n**ILO:** [**https://www.unicrypt.network/amm/uni/ilo/0x4cC177CCE7e533D3f7189Bac202Ad86107a8FD45**](https://www.unicrypt.network/amm/uni/ilo/0x4cC177CCE7e533D3f7189Bac202Ad86107a8FD45)\n\n**DYOR, not your mother, etc.**",

Tezos is an open-source platform backed by a worldwide community of validators, academics, and builders that tackles fundamental hurdles to blockchain adoption for assets and applications. Tezos is built with long-term upgradability, open participation, cooperation, and smart contract security in mind.  \nFor those who don't know, Tez (XTZ) is the Tezos network's native coin. Tezos is a blockchain network that uses Liquid Proof of Stake and is open source. Tezos, being a Layer 1 protocol, allows developers to build sophisticated apps utilizing tools that support a wide range of programming languages, including Javascript, Golang, and Python. Music labels, NFT performers, athletic franchises, central banks, real estate developers, and others. So good job gemini for listing Tez!  \nFor USD trading pairs, trading for XTZ will first be available via their FIX/REST APIs and ActiveTraderTM application. Trading for USD, GBP, EUR, CAD, AUD, HKD, and SGD pairings will then begin on their Gemini Mobile App and website.  \nTezos promotes innovation to ensure long-term viability and scalability as crypto usage grows throughout the world.  \nI noticed that Tezos is really upping their game. I've recently noticed their advertisements on brave browser, which is fantastic!   \n[https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-now-supports-tezos](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-now-supports-tezos)  \n \n\nWhat are your thoughts about Tezos?",

The idea is to detect the beginning of a surge trend in order to ride the trend as it develops.\n\nI has trailing stop loss and a couple of other pretty neat features to help maximise the profit and it's highly configurable. It's been tested by around 2000 people already with various degrees of profitability - based on the user's config.\n\nI am now working on creating a web app for it so that's more user friendly than running scrips. Many of you were really interested in the app so I'm happy that some of you have joined in the development of this project!\n\nIf you're interested to be updated on the project's development and to be part of our beta testing release, you can join the subreddit that I just created for it. Bear in mind it's all bearbones right now, but I will post more regular updates on this particular project on there :)\n\nWe chose the name after the Norse God of Knowledge - the badass Mimir.\n\n[https://np.reddit.com/r/MimirTrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/MimirTrading)\n\nOr if you want to register your interest for beta testing, just go here:\n\n[https://mimirbot.com/](https://mimirbot.com/)\n\nLastly, if you're good with code and would like to try out the alpha version check out the github repo:\n\n[https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/Binance-volatility-trading-bot](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/Binance-volatility-trading-bot)",

Big Dog Metaverse claims that Meta\u2019s business model is flawed and claims to provide an alternative metaverse that will not be subject to privacy concerns or censorship. \n\nBig Dog issued the following statement: \n\n\u201cFacebook has changed its name to Meta in an unfortunate attempt to dominate the metaverse with the same unscrupulous practices they have used in social media platforms. Meta and Mark Zuckerberg have a long history of misusing user data for use by nefarious political actors, scam marketers, and more. Moreover, they have sole authority to censor users when users express \u2018disagreeable\u2019 points of view. Big Dog Metaverse is completely decentralized meaning users decide their reality instead of large corporate overlords. We are holding this demonstration at Meta HQ to let people know, they have a choice and they should choose wisely.\u201d\n\n**Event Details**\n\nWhat\n\nProtest against Meta\u2019s alleged misuse of consumer data\n\nDate\n\nMonday January 10, 2022 \n\nTime\n\n12PM\n\nLocation\n\nOutside the \u201cthumbs up\u201d sign at Meta HQ\n\n1 Hacker Way Menlo Park, CA 94025. \n\nProtective masks with the iconic Big Dog Token logo along with food and beverages will be provided for all attendees as a \u201cthank you\u201d from Big Dog Metaverse to those who show up. \n\n**About Big Dog Metaverse**\n\nThe Big Dog Metaverse is a social platform where users can sign up and create their own Big Dog characters. Each character is also a unique NFT and comes with a social profile, stat points and an experience-based growth system. Experience points can be obtained from playing Big Dog mini games, engaging in social activities and building a good reputation in the Big Dog",

            "text": "Hey everybody,\n\nBig time lurker since about 2013 in the crypto space and wanted to share something I built that may or may not be interesting to you.\n\nSo here we go...\n\n**what did I build :** an application to systematically generate orders and give you the entry  points you want\n\n**why did I build it**: I got tired of using garbage crypto exchange UIs and wanted to enter more than 1 order at a time\n\n**how did I build it:** I built it from scratch using React, Node, Mongo, and ElectronJS\n\nLet's get to the tour:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A nice landing page for CoinCatcher](https://preview.redd.it/spf97jpaodj71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5540c631573af116349181eef7a14375ea01331d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Seems pretty basic.. what's so cool about it?**\n\nwell, from this app, you can view and manage all your portfolios on crypto exchanges in a single interface. How many of you can tell me the % portfolio allocation that you have in BTC or ETH or USDT even? Unless you track it outside somewhere, probably very few.\n\nCoinCatcher wires up to CoinbasePro, Binance, and KuCoin (With future implementations of Gemini and Bittrex)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Exchange Management in one place](https://preview.redd.it/9rs6s61wodj71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7ca7070be73a062d4c541b1eda5e6b02f80d941)\n\n**Now that you have some exchanges added... what do you do?**\n\nFirst, you could go to balances and see just what your allocation is across all assets in all connected exchanges.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Asset Allocation Across all exchanges](https://preview.redd.it/78ymulx5pdj71.png?width=1722&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1e645ac6a22448e9ac5ef5dcd0681e81639f9de)\n\nThat's a pretty cool feature I'd say and helpful for those of you who trade multiple assets.. but where are the orders?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[View open orders for a particular exchange](https://preview.redd.it/h14vmqnfpdj71.png?width=1921&format=png&auto=webp&s=55bbde013dad83f2e7507f18ff6d85c129b09dfa)\n\n**and you can see market position for that trading pair**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BTC-USD on CoinbasePro](https://preview.redd.it/pkgqbmjupdj71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd7a8eba23f0cdd60ebc358775a16fd0b5f4bb20)\n\nAs you can see in the graph, there's a green area indicative of buys, black bar which represents market price and if there are sell orders, they're noted as a red area chart to the right side of market price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How would you know what orders filled?** I'm glad you asked...\n\nIn the fills section, CoinCatcher pulls fills for the last 24H, 2D, 5D, 7D, or 30D.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fills](https://preview.redd.it/d1a3duh6qdj71.png?width=1908&format=png&auto=webp&s=6924e22215357943c8ab7fef90c263de5739e7c4)\n\nLuckily there's functionality to figure out what you **average cost**  is for that set of fills:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Aggregated fills with average cost](https://preview.redd.it/jzg35hagqdj71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=59e3e83b2829137f54dc1f8053a85e812fee4a5d)\n\n**Now to the core of the app: how to place orders**\n\nSay I wanted to trade BTC-USD on coinbase and I wanted to buy the dip as we've just rallied to 50k and can expect some pullback.... with the TradingView chart you can see the $48,000 to $42,500 zone is ripe for buying as we could see potential support somewhere in there..**but where?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Buy A Zone](https://preview.redd.it/2dnbv5spqdj71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3deb085acd0fa68bb768ef34f5f43fef0001153)\n\nLuckily, if you're correct in your prediction and there's a support zone somewhere in there, you will be a buyer and hopefully catch the lowest local point... **Here's how**\n\n**Select the Exchange to trade on**\n\n**Choose your trading pair, enter total $$ (capital allocation), starting order price(48,000) and ending price (42,500)**\n\n**Enter Starting size (0.01BTC) and increment Price (buy every $500 down) and increment size (0.01BTC) or 43%**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This is your entry](https://preview.redd.it/sf9bwxoqrdj71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc45c4bfa8557bacfc7d6df02b51d8f4c4b3717e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[These are your orders](https://preview.redd.it/n28mh7psrdj71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=16b1843d1a9f78ad18787231a981fa55fbe189b2)\n\n**After you click send orders, all the orders in that grid will be sent off to the exchange and HOT on the books.**\n\nIf I wasn't poor this would work but this is the result:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I don't actually have $50,000 to place orders with but you get the gist...](https://preview.redd.it/xya7s5q1sdj71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b15d9ae3593ac418830ebbabe775ad76ee7bea03)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**One last sneak peak:** for those of you who like Binance Futures. It's wired up to get you an entry in about 12 seconds (from what I measured). I called it **\"Fast Mode\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[and with 4 clicks.. you're in the market](https://preview.redd.it/0f94ipbosdj71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dd0eb664eec4ee42a28029971f1739a0805e133)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know what you guys think...

            "text": "Comparing nowadays market with 2013/2017 we see very similar patterns arise. Hysteria is probably gonna break out sooner than later, and here is why.\n\nNOTE: this is my personal, speculative view based on  pattern recognition and market sentiment. I'm not here to create any FUD/FOMO or whatever, even though I'm probably still getting flamed for it in the comments.\n\n1. The marketing and creation of shitcoins is still on a contant rise. A LOT of new investors fall for fake promises from new projects, because they think it's the next new thing. This is ofcourse nothing new, BUT it won't slow down until we're starting to see red numbers again, and the shitcoin teams cannot afford to invest into marketing anymore.\n\n2. ETH will most likely overtake BTC as crypto asset with the largest market cap. This is mostly derived from the fact that ETH is still by far the most utilised and adopted blockchain out there, and with continuous work from the dev team, that won't change anytime soon. If u take a look at the BTC dominance chart, I expect a similar pattern to that in 2017. When this hits the news a new wave of dumb money will shortly flow into the market, leading to large price volatility.\n\n3. Looking at the market cycles, most technical analysts believe that BTC will climb to new ath's this year. Combine this with the fact that the BTC dominance will most likely keep dropping, altcois will soar when this happens.\n\n4. When everyone thinks they can cash out soon and never have to work again, big corporations who have had a balanced portfolio since like forever (and basically control the market) will just dump on the average joe, leading to real FUD all over town, and ending the 2nd part of the 2021 bull run.\n\nThere are more points that I'm willing to discuss in the comments, but for now I've taken my shit, so it's time to go on with life.\n\nFeel free to share your opinions and have a civilised discussion in the comments.",

Ofcourse BTC will be there, becausr that's what the people know and love (even though I think the product is essentially useless). I think the projects you should watch out for the most are: ETH, ADA, DOT, SOL and BNB. These are imo the largest blockchains who are competing for market dominance. If i.e. ETH is performing well, you can see projects like UNI, AAVE, MKR, etc. follow suit. If on the other hand ADA's fees and smart contracts work much better, we might see some existing projects moving to their chain (like what singularityNET did). Same thing for the other blockchains.\n\nTldr: follow news about the leading blockchains, and the biggest projects on these chains. Always look critically at the articles you read, because I see some  terrible journalism on the internet (looking at you cointelegraph).",

When is the best day of the week to sell and best day of the week to buy? Well I looked into it and created some tables. Some things to know:\n\n* Dates: January 18, 2017 - January 17, 2018\n* Top 10 coins/tokens based on current market cap that have a full 365 days worth of data\n* The change in price is reflective of the opening price each day\n* I used US, China, and S. Korea Holidays, but more can be added if they are relevant to market prices.\n* I used all relevant holidays and special dates that I could find for the 3 countries. If there are more to add, please let me know for version 2.0 of this sheet (Version 2.0 will include data from the top 25 coins/tokens)\n* The 4 charts in the link below are for days of the week, US holidays, China holidays, and S. Korea holidays.\n\n[4 Interesting Charts](https://imgur.com/wLMXpIg)\n\nSome conclusions:\n\n* New year's eve was the biggest buy day of the major holidays\n* New year's day was the biggest sell day of the major holidays.\n* Tuesday was the most popular day for an increase, suggesting you should sell on these days.\n* Saturday was the least popular day for an increase, suggesting you should buy on these days.\n* October 4 and 5 were both significant days in China and S. Korea for holidays, and both showed a decrease in the market.\n* Holidays in May were all shown to have increases in the market, regardless of the country.\n\n\nI hope you all enjoy this, and let me know what you all would like to see for version 2.0.\n\ndosequisxx",

Finally, I removed all coins that were not on the infrastructure level and coins that I could not ascertain to become monopolies.\n\n \n\n\nConclusion\nThis led me to 10 coins (unintentional number) that are monopolies in their respective category + 1 that I kept as a hedge for payments, since it is the most fragmented and uncertain category:\n\n\nEthereum \u2013 platform\n\n\nBitcoin \u2013 store of value\n\nLitecoin \u2013 payments\n\nNeo \u2013 platform (China)\n\nMonero \u2013 anonymity\n\nAragon \u2013 governance\n\n0x \u2013 exchange\n\nCivic \u2013 identity\n\nRaiden \u2013 scalability (for Ethereum)\n\nEnigma \u2013 privacy\n\nHedge: RaiBlocks \u2013 payments\n\n \n\nRemarks\n\nOnly 3 are not in the top 100: Civic, Raiden, and Aragon. I excluded the investment allocations for each coin, since that is completely opinionated/dynamic. If anyone has legitimate reasons for adding coins to this list that they believe to be monopolies, then I\u2019ll happily debate with you in the comments. Thanks for reading.",

[Feel free to post your questions over there.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/pq2t2c/i_am_a_cryptocurrency_tax_attorney_ama/)\n\nTo answer OP's question, you should be tracking all of your trades and calculating your gains/losses for each taxable transaction. (Any time you trade crypto-to-crypto counts.)\n\nIf you have unrealized gains/losses, they don't count for your taxes, so if you stopped trading and the value of your assets rose before the end of the year, you wouldn't pay taxes on that value. The thing that matters is your overall *realized* gains and losses. \n\nIf you pay taxes on your gains and the value drops, you can sell for a loss and 'realize' the losses. Keep track of these losses though since you are allowed to 'gain' back the value of any capital losses tax-free by carrying your losses forward into next year. Sometimes, if you realize massive losses, this can mean tax-free gains for years in the future. \n\nWhile it stinks to have to pay taxes in such a volatile marketplace, the good thing is that so long as you track your activity, you can write off the losses as well. \n\nThere is software on the market for DYI crypto taxes. Ideally, you'd just plug in your wallet addresses and have everything sorted out automatically. Depending on the types of trades you made and the setup of the defi activity you participated in, some of these softwares will be pretty painless. However, I have not yet found any perfect software that does everything. As a result, you should expect some level of manual manipulation of the data to make sure things line up properly. \n\n182 trades isn't a whole lot of activity for a year, so even if you had to manually build those out it shouldn't take more than an afternoon. \n\nGiven how little your USD gains were, I can't exactly say it would be a worthwhile investment, but there are also CPA's and tax firms that can do this kind of work for you. While it is always nice to know things are going to be done correctly, it isn't exactly cheap. In your case, you could possibly pay someone a couple thousand dollars to realized $4k in gains. Obviously this is not the most efficient use of your money, so it is up to you if you go this route. \n\nUnfortunately, this is one of those hidden costs of trading crypto. Very few projects are designed with the tax implications in mind and it makes it pretty hard to pay taxes if you haven't been tracking your activity. That being said, if you've kept everything limited to a single wallet (or a couple wallets/exchanges) it should be fairly easy to unravel after-the-fact if you're willing to put in the time.",

Congratulations on the capital gain. And, you owe tax on this gain.\n\nThe volume of your trades is irrelevant to the IRS. They don't care if you made one trade, or two-hundred trades. The IRS only cares about the \"taxable events\", which is; selling for a profit/loss, or exchanging for a profit/loss, or, staking for a profit/loss. This includes exchanging from one crypto to another. So if you bought $100 in Doge, and the price of Doge increased, and you were able to then exchange it for $150 of Shiba, it means you made a profit of $50 on your original Doge, and you would owe tax on that $50. The tax would be a *short-term capital gain tax* (which is the same as your standard income tax rate for whatever income bracket you are in). You owe this tax even if you never convert the Shiba back into US$. You owe this tax even if the price of Shiba plummets. The exchange from one coin to another was the taxable event, regardless of what happens to Shiba.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe price in US$ that you acquired the Shiba becomes your acquisition price of the Shiba, so if the price of Shiba now plummets, you can take the loss as a deduction if you sell the Shiba.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*It's important to understand that the swap from one crypto to another is a taxable event, so you will have to pay taxes on that swap* (or, if you made a loss on the swap, you can deduct the loss). Even if you do not convert to fiat, the swap itself was a taxable event.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you report this? You can use some online tools for this, or you can just break out an excel spreadsheet and start recording the 182+ trades  you made. 182+ trades is a lot of excel lines, but... welcome to the adult world. This is all reportable on your 2021 taxes, which will be due April 15th next year. This also means that if you make more trades from now until the end of December, you will add those trades into the calculation also. This is also true for any losses you make between now and December. All of these are added up together (along with any fees) to arrive at your capital gains/losses for your 2021 trades. As u/RED_BULLish_Crypto says, IF you owe MORE than a certain amount in taxes, you may have to pay quarterly estimates. I think the threshhold is $1000 in taxes. Anyway, you can search online for this.",

            "text": "Be sure to read this, you will be HAPPY you did - VeChain\n\nGuys,\nFirst let me say that I own VeChain, but this post is way beyond my personal investment but instead I\u2019d like to provide a fresh look into why VeChain as we the best investments in Blockchain technology for years to come.\nThe market today is all about FOMO and hype, and that\u2019s absolutely fine, the market can continue and increase in total Cap for years to come, but eventually the blockchain and its related tokens will need serious adoption to utilize and incentivise each project.\nMany of the amazing projects with super high valuation (i.e.: IOTA, EOS\u2026) are just speculation and it may be that they can deliver and all will be well.\n\n\nHowever, VeChain is VERY different, as explained by Sunny Lu, the CEO of VeChain.\n\nVeChain is building business relations FIRST and letting its customers dictate the path forward. \nWith already agreements in place with the Chinese national Govt as well as many other multi billion dollar companies:\n\n===============================\n\nHubei Sanxin Cultural Media Ltd.\n\nBitOcean\n\nHealthcare Co. Ltd\n\nXiamen Innov Information Technology Co Ltd\n\nA Global Convenience Store Franchise\n\nLooking Into Who Is Jiangsu Printed Electronics\n\nVeChain teams up with Madeforgoods | CN press release\n\nVeChain affirms partnership with China Unicom\n\nGlobal strategic cooperation with DNV GL\n\nGroupe Renault teams with Microsoft and...\n\nWorld\u2019s Largest Freight Company to Use Blockchain Tech for Asset Management\n\nPwC CN: VeChain S.E.A. becomes a portfolio company of PwC\u2019s incubation...\n\nBabyghost and VeChain: Fashion on the Blockchain - Nasdaq.com\n\nChina\u2019s Largest Wine Importer Wants to Place Wine on a Private Blockchain\n\nBright Fishery (officially announced in weekly report vol.6)\n\nAnd many more with signed NDAs (BMW rumered and more\u2026)\n\nVeChain is positioning itself to be in high demand and usage for years to come. \n\nVeChain is re-banding itself as VET VeChain/Thor (instead of just VEN) and will deliver a revolutionary new Blockchain-X in Q2 of 2018. With \nthe rebranding they announced a passive income system through proof of stake which is bound to create generous returns for anyone holding 10K of VET or more.\n\n\n===============================\n\nWhat I think many people are missing is the fact that even if the entire Crypto market crashed (which I don\u2019t see happening at 700B which is still low), the VeChain/Thor will thrive due to the need for its technology and business partners which will adopt the technology in 2018.\nSo when you are investing in VeChain, you are getting a double reward. If the Crypto market doubles in total Cap, you VET will be worth substentilaly more, but even the market has peaked, the fact that the VeChain ECO system will thrive (and it is a fact IMHO due to the many business relationships) your VET will create a very high ROI. VeChain is exceeding all expectations when it comes to its enterprise market penetration and we are all in January (testnet will be released Q2 of 2018). \n\n===============================\n\n\nThe investment world is taking notice as Breyercapital and other investment firms are adding VeChain to its very limited blockchain profolio. \nSo I know what you must be thinking, well it all sounds nice and well, so why did VeChain only go up 10x in  past month and not 100x. \nWell the answer is simply (and I got proof). Whales (many of them Chinese) are well aware that VeChain will be a top player in the crypto work and are trying to gain as many VET as they can before the tokens gets up really high in value. And so market manipulation is happening in unprecedented fashion (never seen anything like it in any other coin) and high sell walls and \ncontinues re-buys to force the price to remain low so they can accumulate.\nHere is a proof: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8k6w5cen3ryu2yt/Chart.png?dl=0\nWhales are trying to get enough VET so they own a Mjolnir master node which can pay close to 1,000,000.00 a year if and when the price of VET gets to $25.00 \nSee here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bfgixylquemgtby/VET.jpg?dl=0\n\n===============================\n\nI honestly believe the price will climb well above $100 USD before Q2 2018 as VeChain is a game changing blockchain company in its approach to business relations first and adoption second.\nThis is giving everyone an opportunity to get in now before the Whales stop price manipulation (eventually they will stop since they have accumulated enough and wish to the price climb themselves). I honestly believe this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and this is the reason for my first real post in Reddit Blockchain (all my other posts are on programming Google Angular :)\nNow let me prove to you that the writing is on the wall.\n\n\n\nThis morning the market crashed +20% and yet you can see that ONLY VeChain is maintaining it\u2019s price, that is because the Whales auto orders are buying everything they can below and above a certain price.  As you can see from my snapshot from 8AM this morning:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/2aeki6xbwdwjt75/Market.JPG?dl=0\nI know many of you think that if you buy into VeChain now you are getting it at its all time high, but in a year you will look back at its current market Cap of 1.5B and you will be amazed at how undervalue it has been (this is my personal opinion and not financial advice).\nNow don\u2019t take my word for it, always do your own research.\nI do highly recommend you watch the very popular Boxmining video on VeChain:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH2G_44x4vw&t=767s\nas well as:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42_YmVGs5MA&t=300s\n\n\n===============================\n\nand most importantly the VeChain THOR Power Forged AMA:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWoEsBQFozM\nThe opportunity here is mind boggling and while it goes without saying that I have a VET and would like to see it rise in price, I am sure this single post is not going to make even a small dent in its high volume trading and so I am not posting this for my own benefit but instead to open everyone\u2019s eyes to this amazing opportunity. I am an Angular developer and I spend hundreds of hours developing open source code which is posted on GitHub for the benefit of the Angular community and so I am used to giving back (you can see my Reddit ratings and post history of years). It\u2019s just the first time I am doing the same for the Crypto community,\n\n===============================\n\nHappy new year and good luck,\n\n\nSean.\n",

I don't think people fully understand - not only is VeChain arguably the most exciting crypto based on their outlined roadmap, they are about to be doing something that only one other crypto (that I know of) is doing, and that crypto grew over 6000X in 2017. That coin is NEO and what VeChain is doing is paying crypto's version of dividends.\n\nIf you haven't heard, NEO holders get paid dividends of GAS just for holding NEO in their wallet. I have made over $500 just off of GAS dividends alone, not to mention the tremendous gainz from NEO.\n\nBack to VeChain. When they rebrand from VEN to VET in Q2, they will be the second coin to introduce crypto dividends in the form of THOR (a new coin that will be created after the rebrand). So that means, if you are a VET holder, you will start to earn free THOR which is both attractive as a VeChain holder, and as a THOR holder.\n\nI expect VeChain to steeply rise in the next few months leading up to their rebrand, with a HUGE spike after people start really understanding this concept of free coin!",

I put in less than $5,000 (not that much but it should help with college loans at least a little).\n\n\nMy questions:\n\n\n1) What tax form do I use when reporting crypto gains? I\u2019ve heard of 1040 and LIFO and FIFO but I don\u2019t know what form(s) to use.\n\n\n2) Do I have to keep a record of every single trade, even crypto-to-crypto?\n\n\n3) I have no income besides crypto at the moment, but when I get a job on campus next semester, I\u2019ll have some extra income. What is the income threshold, if there even is one, to where I have to start reporting gains?\n\n\n4) Lets say that somewhere along the line, I end up messing up and my taxes aren\u2019t reported correctly, or even at all. I don\u2019t know how that would happen but let\u2019s say it happens. What does the IRS do to me? Do I have to pay a penalty, or is it worse (jail)? \n\nThanks for taking your time to answer all these questions.",

All numbers here hypothetical and hopefully simplified.\n\nI buy 0.5 Eth @ $900/eth on Monday.\n\nI buy 0.5 Eth @ $1100/eth on Tuesday. (average $1000/eth)\n\nI exchange 1 Eth valued at $1200/eth on Wednesday for $1200 worth of cryptox.\n\nI turn back into 1.1 Eth on Thursday now valued at $1000/eth again.\n\n\nMy first transaction I made an even exchange (1200 for 1200) gaining nothing, but for tax purposes they count a gain of $200 since Ethereum is worth $200 more than when I bought it?\n\n\nMy second transaction I gained 0.1 Eth (+$100 on that day), but technically lost $100 total value. Is this taxed at a gain or a loss of $100?\n\n\nThen Friday, Eth drops to $700/eth and doesn't recover until after tax season, but I make no transactions. I am now in the red $230, but I'm still taxed as if I had made money? Taxes are a joke....with no punchline.\n\n",

Not to mention over 40% (!) of the total supply is locked in staking. \nNow, if that's not bullish, I don't know what is.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\ud83d\udccc Utilities \u2013 beta version release by end of February\n\n\n- IDO LaunchPad. BSC and ERC-20 (all other chains will follow).\n- On-Chain Data Analytics. BSC and ERC-20 (all other chains will follow).\n- Cross-Chain DEX to be delivered approx April. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur dev Monk is setting up a fully registered Hedge Fund Company which will be a tokenized project that launches on our LaunchPad. M31 Holders will gain access to this and can invest BUSD for monthly returns of approx 10%.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\ud83d\udccc The following MAJOR publications will be writing in-house articles about our project to coincide with our utility release. **This is not a press release.** Each of these publications are writing the article themselves!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**VentureBeat, USA today, Arizona Central, Detroit Free Press, Maxim, HackerNoon, SFGate, Chron, Times Union, SF Chronicle, Houston Chronicle, Bitcoinist, NewsBTC, Benzinga, Village Voice, L.A.

Given, this was EARLY on. I'm talking late December 2020, $2.57 a share. I had a GUT feeling with the growth of wallstreet bets, these stocks were surly gonna moon shot. So at $32.11 I APED 100k into GME. The other 11k I split between NOK & AMC. \n\nLong story short I sold GME at $319.29. Paper hands sold all of it. You do the math.\n\nNow here comes where I need YOUR help.\n\nI am going to test this AGAIN, but with crypto. I have $111k in checking right now. I will put $11,111.1 into the TOP 5 most upvoted/vouched for/best DD coins y'all comment. \n\nI will post monthly updates of my gains and loses of each coin.\n\nPlease make this a fun and good experience for me I've never trusted this much money in strangers, however; I have faith in yall.\n\nUPDATE: DEC 4th 12:01.",

                            "response": "And the Banano argument is as follows....\n  You want to make some serious money again, buy Banano. Current market cap is around 42 million at the time of writing. I expect Banano to somewhat easily do a 10x from here, which would make it a 420 million dollar cap, which would put us around the 155 to 160th spot on coin market cap. That doesn't sound very unrealistic. \n\nThere is a lot of hype around banano right now and for good reason. Most people think that Banano is just some shitcoin like all the dog coins and rugpulls out there. Banano is nothing like them. The Banano guys like to have fun and they have built a small ecosystem surrounding this coin. Over 32,000 monkeys on their reddit, over 37,000 monkeys in their discord and over 12,000 on their telegram. If you want to know why some stocks and some crypto do well, it's because of the growing number of monkeys that get behind them. Everyone loves Banano and it's growth is going to get much bigger. If you head over to yellowspyglass.com this will show Banano distribution  and wallets. Currently 145,000 wallets holding Banano. That's a pretty decent sized cheering squad. \n\nBanano is a fork of Nano, which means it gets to enjoy the same fast and feeless transactions. Kalium is a mobile wallet that can hold your Bans and its gotta be one of the simplest wallets you can use. The nice part is 1 ban is 1 Ban, so it's very fun to test it out and send it around. \n\nBanano also figured they would get involved with DEX's for more exchange options. Currently available on Pancake Swap and Sushi swap as Wrappen Banano (WBAN). \n\nAlot of the devs work on both projects, banano and nano. They have come up with some cool ideas/projects including Camo Banano, which is currently still in development. Fast,feeless and untraceable sounds pretty wild to me. \n\nAnother part of the eco system is folding at home. You can donate your computer power to scientific research and get paid Banano for doing so. Team Banano is quite often one of the number 1 folders in the world. \n\nWant to earn Banano by watching TV or videos, check out jungle.tv  and earn bans for watching. \n\nThe founders of Banano and whole team can be found in the discord daily and they are truly a wonderful group. I know everyone shills their coin to you and says they are the best, but I truly believe they are the best. Even DOGE creator Billy Markus agrees that Banano is a stand out to him. I would send a link to confirm that, but I'm deep in this post on my cell phone. So just go to r/banano, sort by top all time, scroll down a couple and you will find the post from Billy Markus himself. \n\nAnyways, good luck with what ever coin you end up choosing, but I know this one is gonna be a huge winner and will deliver way bigger gains than all the top 20 coins being mentioned to you.\n\nPS- I noticed most people shilling you didn't provide any DD, I hope you get the chance to read this.",

There is no mistake that its technology alongside with good fundamentals will take Avalanche ( Avax)  in the top 5 cryptos.\n\nAvalanche   has a market cap of 15 billion and Ethereum 's market cqp is 520 billion. So we have a lot of better chance of 4-5-6x  our money. \nAlso Avalanche is burning coins with e ery transaction and iw becoming smore valuable\n\nAvalanche\u00a0is a\u00a0layer one blockchain\u00a0that functions as a platform for decentralized applications and custom blockchain networks. It is one of Ethereum\u2019s rivals, aiming to unseat\u00a0Ethereum\u00a0as the most popular blockchain for\u00a0smart contracts. It aims to do so by having a higher transaction output of up to 6,500 transactions per second while not compromising scalability.\n\nThis is made possible by Avalanche\u2019s unique architecture. The Avalanche network consists of three individual blockchains: the X-Chain, C-Chain and P-Chain. Each chain has a distinct purpose, which is radically different from the approach Bitcoin and Ethereum use, namely having all nodes validate all transactions. Avalanche blockchains even use different consensus mechanisms based on their use cases.\n\nAfter its mainnet launch in 2020, Avalanche has worked on developing its own ecosystem of\u00a0DApps\u00a0and\u00a0DeFi. Different Ethereum-based projects such as SushiSwap and TrueUSD have integrated with Avalanche. Furthermore, the platform is constantly working on improving interoperability between its own ecosystem and Ethereum, like through the development of\u00a0bridges.",

While other crypto wallets require me to use a seed phrase, with ZenGo, I didn't get any passwords or seed phrases which is strange.\n\n\\-------------------  \nReddit answer to upvote:  \n\\-------------------  \nZenGo uses your biometric data (fingerprint) to encrypt a key (password) which, half of it is on your phone and backup on cloud services, and the other half of the password is stored on ZenGo's server.  \nIn this way, no one besides you can control your crypto, but at the same time, your wallet is also recoverable, unlike cold wallets, which do not provide any backup if the password is lost.  \nBeing in charge of your own \"cold\" crypto wallet security comes with great responsibility, and human error could lead to theft or accidental deletion.\n\nBy using their wallet, you remove the need for a password, so you can never lose it, and you can never fall into phishing scams or any other password theft hacks that ask for your private key.\n\n   This is enabled by using a unique security model called MPC (Multi-Party Computation), which keeps the user's data hidden from the provider.  \nZenGo describes their security model in depth here: [https://zengo.com/security/](https://zengo.com/security/).",

According to LaLiga\u2019 s latest  research, they are also areas where crypto is taking off amongst fans.  Data from this year reveals that 1 in 10 fans in the MENA region are  crypto investors and 6 out of 10 crypto investors in the MENA region are  LaLiga fans.\n\n\u201cCrypto is being embraced by football fans and we want to bring in  partners who demonstrate our understanding of what\u2019s important to them  and align with our values. In that regard, Divi Labs was an obvious  choice,\u201d said **Oscar Mayo, Executive Director at LaLiga. \u00a8Much like LaLiga they are a challenger brand that is innovating its sector.**  Like us they are driven to deliver the very best experience to their  fans. But perhaps most importantly, they, like us, care about building  close links with their community and are driven to leave a long-lasting  positive impact on everyone they reach.\u201d\n\nThe partnership will push the boundaries of brand activation through a  comprehensive schedule of activities. Areas include the creation of  unique content and player-driven experiences that will help educate fans  about crypto, leveraging of key LaLiga assets and platforms including,  TV, experiential events, & the integration of CSR initiatives to  build awareness of, and facilitate access to, essential services in  local communities experiencing challenges that can be solved through  crypto.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with LaLiga gives us a powerful platform from which  to reach and engage new audiences around the world and deliver on our  mission to enable people from all walks of life to engage in the crypto  economy and achieve financial freedom and inclusion,\u201d said **Nick Saponaro, CEO, Divi Labs**.  \u201cCritically, it also offers a launchpad from which to get our products  into the hands of people who need them most. The partnership will enable  us to accelerate the creation of real-world initiatives that help some  of the most in-need communities on the planet.\u201d\n\nBy removing barriers to entry, innovating new frictionless  technologies, and delivering use cases for the developed and developing  world, Divi Labs is on a mission to help people across the globe to  engage in the crypto economy and achieve financial freedom and  inclusion. Its self-custodial mobile wallet comes loaded with innovative  features that deliver on the company\u2019s promise of individual control  and financial sovereignty. They include Divi\u2019s patented 1-Click  Masternode (MOCCI\u2122) and staking vault technologies that make earning and  owning crypto as easy as pressing play on Spotify.\n\nNow that the hard work has been done and its core technologies have  been implemented, Divi Labs\u2019 next step is to bridge into DeFi and work  with LaLiga, its audience and partners to shape the roadmap by defining  the features they\u2019d like to come next.\u00a0\n\n\u00a9 LaLiga - 2021  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/crypt0snews/comments/r7f4bs/laliga\\_names\\_divi\\_the\\_official\\_crypto\\_wallet\\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypt0snews/comments/r7f4bs/laliga_names_divi_the_official_crypto_wallet_for/)",

Centralized exchanges are forced to comply with these rules, you could lose all your crypto in any time.\n\n\n You may be wondering where do I put my coins in. What's the alternative to centralized exchanges you may ask. The answer is simple. You need to have a crypto wallet to store your coins.There are some apps on android, IOS, windows and others, make sure your DYOR to get the right one. As the saying goes : \"Not your keys, not your coins\". And even better, store it in a hardware wallet if you have a large sum of money in crypto. And then you have to try decentralized finance or DeFi for short. You can look into the well known ones like Aggregated Finance, PankakeSwap or Aave. \n\n\n\nIn conclusion, not your keys not your coins, so store your coins on hard wallets and try out DeFi instead of using centralized exchanges.",

In such field, weaknesses were scalability, security, liquidity, accessibility to information, and of course centralization. And as a response, simply the term DeFi 2.0 has become popular to describe a new generation of DeFi. \n\nOf course many projects have had their hands in this field, but as usual Polygon its own plans to help shaping DeFi. That\u2019s when Polysynth was deployed on Polygon Mainnet couple of months ago, aiming to become the home for entire scope of perpetual swaps where every asset would actually be tradable. \n\nI believe guys that MATIC is where theories turn into world class products, and dreams turn into efficient and effective reality.

It is simply impossible for the U.S treasury to yield that kind of control over any Cryptocurrency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat Can They Do?\n\nThe most they can do is provide a legal notice to a bank or Cryptocurrency exchanged (Based in the U.S) to freeze your assets, if they think you are involved in illegal activities such as money laundering, scamming or ransomware attacks. The government cannot do jackshit if you have your Crypto in a decentralized wallet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoreover, there are around 27 Million Americans, or 8.3% of the population that own Cryptocurrencies. It is just unfeasible for the government to individually target all of their bank accounts or assets if they are going for Crypto as a whole, which is barely mentioned in the provision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Prohibition Does Not Target Crypto\n\nr/CryptoCurrency \\- The COMPETES act is less serious for Crypto than what some people are making it out to be\n\nNo Mention of Cryptocurrencies\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main prohibition is more likely to be focused on Banks rather than Cryptocurrencies as Criminal transactions are only 0.15% of all Crypto transactions. The Feds aren't dumb, they know this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey're already spying on you\n\nFor the apparent clause that allows spying.... Well you're late. The U.S government has been spying on you for as long as you've been existing and this bill is going to be very insignificant in that regard. Moreover, anyone can \"spy\" on you already through blockchain explorers, but the thing that matters is, they don't know who is behind each wallet\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: The clause of the bill that people are freaking out over is largely irrelevant towards Cryptocurrencies, and Crypto holders who don't hold their wealth in an exchange are still unaffected. So, should you be concerned about this bill? Absolutely, it is still a clear overreach and a few people can still be affected. But should you panic like all media is telling you to? Absolutely not. No government can freeze or control Crypto transactions.",

Personally I can see Russia turning to crypto for a solution(if they didn\u2019t ban it already). For example, one major sanction the west did was freeze Russian billionaires assets that are tied up in the west economy. Whether you agree if these sanctions are good or bad it\u2019s clear that they are extreme. \n\nTo my knowledge if the Russian billionaires had put their money in crypto the west would of been unable to freeze their assets. Obviously for many Russian billionaires it\u2019s too late but for the future I can definitely see some of them taking this route. The obvious concern would be if a crypto wallet got hacked they would lose all of their money which is a million times worse then just getting their assets frozen. However, I\u2019m sure for some Russians this is a small risk which they are willing to take in order to keep their businesses alive. \n\nIn addition, as of now i\u2019m sure crypto has very little use cases in Russia and in the World compared to the amount of use cases the dollar has. This is due to the fact that most places don\u2019t accept crypto yet however that number is slowly increasing. On the other hand the Russian Ruble keeps decreasing in value making it a perfect time to implement change. In my opinion it would only make sense for Russia to adopt crypto. \n\nAnyway thanks for reading lmk what you think!",

These forces have been felt most strongly in the twenty-first century, particularly in the rapid rise of technology and globalization, which has become an inextricable aspect of our existence.\n\nAs a basis, our pick is Sylo. This is a very good project that I have been onto for quite some time. It seeks to be a decentralized communication application and data exchange network powered by a Layer 2 micropayments infrastructure and the SYLO token. User-run Service Peers provide infrastructure to the network. It has the unique Sylo Smart Wallet which has a decentralized private messenger and crypto wallet (where you can store all ERC20 tokens as well as ERC721 NFTs)\n\nThe Sylo Smart Wallet is decentralized with no single point of control. Your communications are encrypted, genuinely safe when combined with military-grade encryption. The ability to support millions of users in terms of performance and scalability, decentralized, private communication, storage, and micropayments are all possible with the network.\n\nSylo ensures that you are safe, with the ability to trust, because the lives of journalists, activists, migrants, and others are dependent on encryption as promised by developers. \n\nThe characteristics Sylo possesses that distinguishes it from the competition is that on the Sylo Platform, all messages, voice conversations, video calls, and file transfers are end-to-end encrypted, which means that only you and your intended recipients can see what is communicated.Sylo adheres to cryptography's first rule: \u201cDon't roll your own crypto.\u201d\n\nThe Sylo smart wallet allows users to buy bitcoin in-app and transmit it directly to their wallet eliminates a major 'anguish' that prevents beginners from taking use of cryptocurrency's benefits. \n\nMeanwhile, developers can use the Sylo Protocol to create decentralized communication applications.The protocol was created solely on a peer-to-peer basis with the purpose of allowing developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) with the same degree of user experience (UX) as regular messaging apps. This helps to avoid the scalability concerns that other dApps encounter.\n\nYou could even use the Sylo Experience SDK to create your own standalone web3 app, leveraging the Sylo Smart Wallet user base of over 50 countries! There is no need to be concerned about registration or other matters such as payments. \n\nCan you share with me what communication network you use apart from MONERO , LITECOIN or DASH and how safe you think you are?",

In September, the total number of cryptocurrency ATMs worldwide reached 10,000, 67 percent more than a year ago. The sector is growing rapidly and is not going to stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FOR MORE INFOMATIONS:**\n\n**OUR WEBSITE:** [**https://bitcovault.com/**](https://bitcovault.com/)\n\n**HOW TO START:** [**https://bitcovault.com/how-to-start**](https://bitcovault.com/how-to-start)\n\n**ABOUT US:** [**https://bitcovault.com/about-us**](https://bitcovault.com/about-us)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is a cryptocurrency ATM and why do you need one\n\nA cryptocurrency ATM (crypto-machine, or BTM, which stands for Bitcoin Teller Machine) is a device that allows buying or cashing in bitcoins (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ether (ETH), Dash (DASH), Litecoin (LTC) and others. Instead of a bank card, it uses a crypto wallet from which coins are debited or sent to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExamples of cryptocurrency ATMs you can buy - [Bitcovault.com](https://Bitcovault.com)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCryptomats are primarily just a convenient way to instantly exchange cryptocurrency for cash without dancing with tambourine. They are most popular among users who don't have constant access to high-speed Internet, and also among those who don't have a bank account or don't want to have one for privacy reasons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow the sector is developing\n\nThe first crypto machine was installed in October 2013 at a Waves coffee shop in downtown Vancouver, Canada. According to Coin ATM Radar, in September 2020, the number of cryptomats worldwide exceeded 10,000. A year ago there were only 6,000; at the beginning of the summer there were 8,000. In just one year, their number has increased by 67%. And although compared to more than 3.5 million conventional ATMs it is like a drop in the ocean - the trend itself is important. The sector is actively growing and shows no signs of slowing down. As cryptocurrencies grow in popularity and confidence in them increases, there are more and more crypto machines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost crypto machines are in the U.S. (7,800 - 127% more than a year ago), Canada (812 units) and the U.K. (260 units). Crypto machines are also popular in developing countries and countries with unstable financial markets. The demand for the service in the Latin American, Asian and Australian markets is also growing rapidly. In total, crypto machines are installed in 71 countries. Russia currently has 51 cryptomats, Ukraine has 23, and Kazakhstan has 3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn total, there are more than four dozen manufacturers of cryptocurrency ATMs. Genesis Coin (35% market share) and General Bytes (30% market share) produce the most devices, as well as Lamassu, BitAccess, Coinsourse. They operate slightly differently, but we won't go into details - there usually aren't many cryptomats around to choose from anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegulation of crypto machines: how they are treated by authorities around the world\n\nCryptocurrency ATMs allow you to buy and sell digital currencies and convert them to cash. Anything related to cash is the domain of bank regulators, so they can't leave cryptocurrencies out. Therefore, in countries where cryptocurrencies are permitted and regulated, crypto operators must comply with anti-money laundering legislation. In the U.S., for example, they must comply with the same standards as banks: register with the Federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as well as obtain a state license. In Canada they have to report all transactions over 10,000 Canadian dollars (about $7400). The authorities often accuse cryptocurrencies of being used by criminals to hide their profits. In reality, criminals launder about $1-3 billion through cryptocurrencies and $0.8-2 trillion through banks and cash. Thus, no more than 0.3-1% of all digital assets are used for criminal purposes.",

            "text": " You know an industry\u2019s going to the next level when it gets its own banking industry. Or so the saying could easily go. Because there haven\u2019t been that many industries, to date, with the ability to create an alternative banking system. But then, blockchain isn\u2019t just another industry: It\u2019s an entirely new paradigm  \nCryptobanking is a concept that takes traditional financial services and positions them for the crypto age. We live in dynamic, ever-changing times, and blockchain has brought a viable solution to the crying shame many of us *knew* we were living but were helpless to change: the fact that our systems, like our institutions, are archaic.\n\nBefore we explore the meaning of a cryptobank, let\u2019s take a step back and consider the meaning of the word \u201cbank.\u201d\n\nA bank\u2019s job is to provide customers with financial services that help people better manage their lives. As technology advances and competition increases, banks are offering different types of services to stay current and attract customers. \u2026 This ensures you get the most out of your current financial institution.\n\nA cryptobank, then, would provide customers with financial services that help people better manage their cryptocurrency portfolios \u2026 *and* their lives (for cryptocurrency is becoming as much part and parcel of our \u201clives'' as fiat).\n\nAdditionally, a cryptobank would help you get the most out of using a single service (e.g. the cryptobank in question), which is in sharp contrast to the current standard of what feels like using 30 different service providers for every 2 altcoins. In turn, such a service offering would attract customers not only to the cryptobank in question but even, if they play their cards right, to cryptocurrency and blockchain as a whole.\n\nWhile it\u2019s early days yet (for the notion of a cryptobank), this is a concept that is sure to gain traction in the near future.\n\nWhat might a cryptobank look like? What follows is a look inside 6banc, a blockchain startup that, owing to its particular service offerings, serves as a good example of how a cryptobank operates.\n\n## Case Study: 6banc\n\nLet\u2019s revisit our banking checklist and apply it to cryptobanking. A cryptobank should be able to move money, store money, grow money, and lend money.\n\n6banc offers all of these, thus serving as the perfect case study for imagining a pathway between cryptocurrency\u2019s current camping spot on the financial outskirts and a world in which a \u201cbank\u201d no longer implies *only* the 621-year-old sense of the word.\n\n[6banc](https://www.6banc.com/) operates in the fintech space. On the surface, they offer what many other blockchain fintech companies bring to market, operating under what you\u2019d consider a current account:\n\n* A multi-currency crypto wallet, available on Android, iOS, and as a web app\n* A debit card, linked to your wallet, to spend your cryptocurrencies anytime, anywhere.\n\nBring the following into the mix, and it gets more interesting but is still a way off from qualifying for \u201ccryptobank\u201d status:\n\n* A native global cryptocurrency trading exchange linked to your accompanying card and wallet\n\nPerhaps this addition brings us closer to a qualifying definition?\n\n* A savings account that rewards account holders for staking their crypto assets that generate higher returns on their investments. \n* A merchant system that will allow businesses to accept payment in any of the above-mentioned currencies, with an option to convert to fiat immediately or keep a percentage or the full amount in crypt\n\nFinally, there\u2019s this. The big kahuna. The elements that drive home the \u201cAha!\u201d moment: there is a life \u2014 growing and thriving \u2014 after conventional banking, after all!\n\n* A fiat loan facility from accredited lenders using your cryptocurrency assets as collateral.\n* Exchanging crypto currency for cash in real-time. With live exchange tracking which brings crypto into the real world.\n* Zero-Cost International Payments. One can pay international vendors around the clock 24/7 with live market exchange rates from FX Desk in New York.\n\nAside from 6banc, other interesting crypto bank start-ups that are worth mentioning are:\n\nZiglu - An internet-first bank for consumers focused on cryptocurrencies. Its account allows consumers to hold multiple (traditional/foreign and digital) currencies in a single account. \n\nSEBA - offers banking solutions for cryptocurrencies to consumers and businesses. It provides transaction banking services for accounts denominated in both crypto and fiat.\n\nNuri - Online investment platform for cryptocurrencies. It enables users to invest in crypto & earn interest in Bitcoin. Users can invest fiat currencies in crypto portfolios.   \n \n\nIn a nut shell\n\nBlockchain is rapidly, and with surprising stealth, transforming the face of the majority of our industries. Not every crypto user is using crypto to do away with middlemen at all costs. Cryptobanks, then, straddle two seemingly opposing worlds: One that\u2019s been reigning for centuries(Banks), and one that\u2019s steadily gaining traction as an alternative financial system(blockchain).",

The point is that if or once a disproportionate amount of your net worth is in crypto, you should reduce that to a more sane risk level.  The opposite is just as true, your millionaire friend with no crypto would not be stupid to put at least some of his inheritance in to crypto even if its at ATH. He could wait for a dip, but that could take forever and he could just as well end up buying in higher, no one knows.\n\nIve been doing this for years, and sure, with hindsight I would have been better off never selling, that is obvious. With hindisight we should all have mortgaged our houses and sold our kidneys to buy more. But we dont have crystal balls. And because I took and continue to take profits, I dont really care when the next crash happens. I will have cemented a good amount of profit which even allows me to buy back in if it drops really deep (and my crypto wallet becomes a too small fraction of my net worth). If it doesnt crash and keeps going up exponentially, thats fine too, sure I will have missed out on some just like everyone who didnt sell their first borne for more crypto,  but I will still have enough in crypto to be perfectly happy with that too.\n\nTL'DR: what is your net worth (and what do you expect to earn in the foreseeable future), and how much of that is in crypto. If its zero percent you are probably doing it wrong. If its 95% then you are doing it wrong too. But it doesnt matter at all how much of your net worth is crypto profit or inherited or you worked your ass off for for 40 years. Money or wealth has no memory, it doesnt know where it came from and neither should you care about that.",

Acumulate pi coins\n\nIt seems super easy and the developers are promising that pi is going to change crypto space forever by making it more accessible and easy to use, and saying how it is the next bitcoin but better and that it's better than other crypto currencies since you can mine it without an expensive computer, all you need is a phone.\n\nThe developers use a lot of buzz words that are used in crypto space like 'mining' , 'halving' and 'crypto wallets' and what not and people are easily falling for it.\n\nHowever, there are a bunch of issues with this 'crypto currency':\n\n1. It isn't actually a cryptocurrency\n2. Mining pi isn't actually mining anything\n3. Pi doesn't have a value and the supply is 'unknown'(unlimited)\n4. It is centralized\n5. It will eventually defeat it's purpose\n\nPi isn't a crypto as they say it is, it isn't decentralized and you can't mine it. The whole 'pi network' is on the copmany's servers. The app has a button that says 'click to mine pi' and by clicking it, pi coins start flooding your 'wallet'. It has nothing to do with mining since you are not providing hash power or liquidity. Basically what's happening is that on their servers, developers are just adding some credits to your account, the same way a video game copany adds virtual money to your online game account. \n\nAnother issue is that pi doesn't have a value. It's worthless. Developers are open about it, since of course they can't hide it, but they are constantly promising that when they 'transition to a blockchain' pi will become valuable. There are millions of users with thousands of pi coins on their accounts and the supply is 'unknown' but right now, it is basically infinite meaning that pi is trully worthless.\n\nThat transition is what I think it's the worst part about this. Basically since pi coin right now isn't a crypto currency, it's just like a score in an online video game, if the developers want to make it a decetralized crypto currency, they are gonna have to develop a new crypto coin, call it pi coin, generate millions of wallets and give them out to users, delete the current pi coins they have and send the exact ammount of PRE-MINED new pi coins to their wallets.\n\nNot only is that going to be extremely complicated to do, but it is also going to mean that pi coin will be almost worthless and it will become impossible to mine it with one click a day(which will defeat it's purpose) because that's not how gas fees work.\n\nDevs are curently runing some 'tests' on their testnet but that's a pointless waste of time since even if they manage to make pi a propper crypto currency, it's gonna be worthless. The only good thing about pi is that you aren't going to lose anything by participating.",

            "text": "Anyone who becomes interested in cryptocurrency eventually realizes that they need to gauge how secure a crypto wallet is. But this is not necessarily a simple task. There are several different kinds of cryptocurrency wallets, including hot wallets, software or desktop wallets, cold wallets, and paper wallets. Which of these is the best option? Every wallet has its benefits and drawbacks. Convenience can come at the cost of security; extra features may come at the cost of simplicity. In an article made by KuCoin, entitled \"Top Crypto Wallets of 2019<Kucoin Blog\", the goal is to help users decide which wallet is the best in order to find the correct wallet for their needs and preferences. Everyone should take several different points into account when looking at these wallets. After reading, it comes down to the point of which to choose? Fortunately, here are some words of advice based on other's experience with the wallets as mentioned in the article above.  \n\n\nHardware and paper wallets aren\u2019t the easiest to use, so while they are very secure, others would not recommend them to crypto beginners. They are also not a good option if someone's planning to make a lot of transactions or send funds back and forth from an exchange. However, if they are confident in their knowledge about cryptocurrency and are looking for a place to store coins long-term, then either a hardware or a paper wallet could fit the bill. Hot wallets are also free but they are much more convenient to use. They are also much less secure. So many would say they are handy for quick transactions and holding small amounts of cryptocurrency, but for sure wouldn't recommend them for storing large amounts of crypto for long periods. Software wallets are a decent middle ground. They are free and only slightly less convenient than hot wallets. They are less secure than paper wallets and hardware wallets, but more secure than hot wallets. However, from all of that said, the main take away from this discussion is that an 'all-in-one wallet' or things like 'most secure crypto wallets' does not yet exist. The decision of which one to use ultimately comes down to what features are most important to each individual. Everyone has to choose one that addresses their most significant concerns, from security, convenience, monetary cost, or even a thing which favors them.  \n[https://blog.kucoin.com/top-crypto-wallets-of-2019-desktop-online-wallets-sk-rd](https://blog.kucoin.com/top-crypto-wallets-of-2019-desktop-online-wallets-sk-rd)",

One has to learn how to use other apps like uniswap and then connect it to a wallet and learn how to work uniswap. It\u2019s honestly all a process and it can take weeks to get used to it. Fortunately for us there is a wallet that is currently being developed that aims to integrate this into one easy app. The wallet is called K9 Wallet. The developer is transparent as to how the progress for the project is looking. Of course, it takes time for a project like this to be developed. The developer also created a token that comes with the wallet. The white paper came out a several days ago and it goes into better detail as to what the developer aims to do. I honestly feel this project is filling up an empty hole in the market that aims to make crypto wallets much more user friendly. Therefore it will introduce new people into the crypto-market Here is the website link https://k9wallet.com/. All the other links that will keep us updated on the project will be on r/k9wallet. Remember, this is pre-wallet/app launch. Always do you your own research and stay safe!!!",

Financial institutions are not allowed by central bank to facilitate **Bitcoin** transactions. Some platforms like **Coinbase** may issue the **IRS**  Form 1099-MISC while others may not leaving you to keep track your  gains and report the income.  That said there are other ways to trade **Crypto**. I have been doing it by **OTC market** traded Grascale **Bitcoin** Trust **GBTC** and **Ethereum** Trust **ETHE**.  Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is a traditional investment vehicle with shares  titled in the investors name, providing a familiar structure for  financial and tax advisors and easy transferability to beneficiaries  under estate laws.\n\nThanks to [https://www.hotstocks.news/about](https://www.hotstocks.news/about)\n\nhe did a good research on Voyager. Since he covered it last Wednesday, **the stock has gone up close to +15%.** Further information was summarized from this article published by [Beth Kindig and Jessica Ablamsky](https://beth.technology/author/newsletterbeth-technology/) on [March 17, 2021](https://beth.technology/2021/03/).\n\n**TLDR**\n\n**Voyager Digital Ltd.**  is basically a digital platform that focuses on enabling users to buy  and sell digital assets such as cryptocurrencies. Voyager was created by  one of the **co-founders of Uber**, **together with executives of E\\*TRADE**, **TradeIt** and **Lightspeed** Financial. The Voyager app enables its users to trade **55 cryptocurrencies** in a fully secure environment.  Users can earn interest on their deposits and trade **100% commission-free**. Voyager doesn\u2019t charge commissions on crypto traders, which is a big differentiator from competitors like **Coinbase** or **Binance**, for example. Actually, **Coinbase**  can often charge ridiculous commissions (a $5k trade could cost you as  much as $80 in commissions). So that gives a valuable edge to **Voyager**. The app supports **Bitcoin**, leading **DeFi** (decentralized finance) tokens, and stable coins, among a variety of other **altcoins** and allows you to trade many tokens that **Coinbase** or **Kraken** does not support. For example, Voyager offers **Dogecoin**, a meme coin pushed by **Elon Musk**.  It also offers interest on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot, and Chainlink.  The Voyager app is currently only available in the US, but there are  plans this year to expand to Canada and Europe, as well as to launch a  debit card. **Voyager** also comes with the added benefit of **offering 9% interest**  on stable coins as the company is a consortium for stable coins,  including USD Coin (USDC) and Tether\u2019s USDT, which have surpassed $7  billion in circulation.  As such, it provides exposure to decentralized  coins like Bitcoin and stable coins based on the fiat system.\n\nA direct competitor of theirs would be **Coinbase** Global, which is the largest U.S. cryptocurrency brokerage, and which [announced](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkU2OhCAQhU_T7DQCgrhgMZu5hkEolWiDgbIdbz_YJoSfRx6v6sMahDmmS-8xI7mnAa8ddIAzb4AIiRwZ0uCdZlKIjkpOnG4dVUIRn4cpAbyN3zSmA8h-jJu3Bn0Mj6Pre0UWLfkE_WgEk9M00Q6oZKOxsoHGWT62_RNsDuchWNDwgXTFAGTTC-KeX_znxX7LOM-zxgUyllSsbXwXzYdPEXyYy95GH0aTobLp2jHaI6Xy4FXBn11MmKF6CqycT2Cx2vzXWDWcdowSr1nD6H2gvGWC1bQuDVhqW9oJMMzxUTkA2huYlGpt39BX27xnVudjzGjsepdEkl7X3eS93M03mq9Ygoeyvo_g8RogmHED90DDh_0X4zBDgFT-xA0GNZVU9EqJrpO0eRgVqpwrLnjBX1JdLK6gl4i5tLvmfzszndU)\n\n that it would go public through a direct-listing initial public  offering that could value the company at more than $100 billion. In  comparison, Voyager had as a market cap of $2b. That\u2019s quite a big gap.\n\nIf **Voyager** were to reach even a 10th of **Coinbase**, the stock would 5x. **Robinhood**,  on its end, is lacking in crypto offerings and it seems like Voyager  has already come at them and eaten some of their crypto-oriented user  base according to [this article](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkUuO5CAMhk9T7FLiEfJYsOjNHGAWs40ccCUoCSBwupXbD-kg7B8ZGZvPFgiXmC-TYiF2u4muhCbgT9mRCDM7C-bJOyM7rXvRKeZM68SgB-bL9MmIB_jdUD6RpXPevQXyMTwZ_TgObDV6_Mwjqmqu06OcueSgdce7uYWPlu4pDKfzGCwa_MZ8xYBsNytRKi_19ZJ_6rbRhwPyhmQhvW08aizH6lYEt_uApZ7v1qv8jbMPa4yuOeI3NtVy8y9esFS1-UoUG8rgfFgaSKlZkEojNa-rcfEn7BHc_QzzRnIpuBK9UK3U8i3e9VtW2Fb0GkE6NQ8OUYyAn2Fo7cjFq-XHIt_lnAuB3e5GWTbblqCkerfcwH6DlddU9TiDp2vCAPOO7kFJz0R-4U4LBsx1Um4CMqITehwG3fed4A-5ylqpQWlVh1KrulizglkjFYp2K_8BcimjwQ)\n\n.\n\nIn terms of **financials**, take a look at the below, courtesy of *Seeking Alpha*.\n\n**Voyager Digital**  announced record Q2:21 revenue of $3.6 million. In February, the  company experienced rapid growth surpassing $1.7 billion in AUM (assets  under management) and $20 million in monthly revenues. Voyager grew from  $5m in AUM in Dec 2019 to $1.7b in Feb 2021 (a 340x), and from 8.5k  trades processed in Dec 2019 to 2m trades processed in Feb 2021. That\u2019s  some serious growth. **VYGVF**  expects strong growth to continue, led by geographical expansion, new  product launches, and platform enhancements. Some examples of new  products include the development of debit and credit cards, margin  products, desktop, and continued expansion of its interest program. In  addition to adding new features and implementing platform enhancements, **VYGVF** is also focused on expanding internationally and bringing the Voyager App to investors in other countries.\n\n**Voyager is FDIC-insured**. However, the crypto held with Voyager is not insured. **Gemini**,  which operates as a trust, has private insurance. Crypto investors  generally store their assets on a cold storage crypto wallet, which  means it is not connected to the internet. In the event there is no  insurance, the risk to cold storage wallets is minimal.\n\n**Voyager** reported roughly **400% growth** from December to January, and **132% growth**  sequentially from January to February for total monthly revenue growth  of over 1000%in a two-month period. Basic users grew from 150,000 in  December to 440,000 by early February. The company reported 605,000  verified users at the end of February.\n\n**The company closed a private placement of $46 million on January 21st, 2021.**\n\n**Voyager**  has seen 75%+ sequential quarter growth with increasing operating  margins in 2020. Per the Investors Presentation, Voyager had a previous  goal of reaching [$20 billion AUM](https://assets.investvoyager.com/k3ZL4_xqClL4CfMu?_ga=2.230700185.789441839.1615737382-348589892.1615737382)\n\nbased  on $500 million AUM as of Q1 2021 (this was achieved at nearly 3X the  company\u2019s original goal with currently $1.7 billion AUM). The company  believes it can achieve 90% CAGR on number of funded accounts and 35%  CAGR on average account size.\n\n**How does Voyager Make Money?**  Voyager\u2019s revenue is not dependent on commissions or fees. The company  plans to introduce a debit card, credit card, margin, loans, and  advisory products over the next year or so. Right now, the business  model creates revenue in **two** specific ways:\n\n1. **Smart Order Routing:**  When you place an order to buy or sell a cryptocurrency, Voyager  provides a listed price that you accept. It then connects your order to  12 exchanges. Unlike securities, which by law must have the same price  across all domestic exchanges, cryptocurrencies are priced at variable  levels. In other words, the same coin can be listed at two different  prices at the exact same time. Voyager uses your order to capitalize on  this inefficiency by performing an arbitrage across various exchanges.  The profits from such a move would typically surpass any commission or  fee, allowing Voyager to provide exceptional pricing. Voyager will thus  share the profits from this arbitrage with you in an attempt to execute  your order at a lower price than you agreed to.\n2. **Voyager operates like a bank.**  However, Voyager is not considered a bank or a broker-dealer. In their  terms and conditions, Voyager very clearly states \u201cWe will lend, sell,  pledge, rehypothecate, assign, invest, use, commingle or otherwise  dispose of funds and cryptocurrency assets to counterparties, and we  will use our commercial best efforts to prevent losses.\u201d If you receive a  loan from a bank, the loan is used by the bank as collateral for other  investments. This creates multiple derivatives on a single asset. This  is similar to **Robinhood**  in that the users take on counter party risk. Should Voyager become  insolvent, you will need to stand in line behind other creditors to  receive your money back. For taking on this risk, **Voyager** offers significant yield in a yield-starved economy. Like a bank, a minimal deposit must be kept to receive this **interest** payment, which can be **as high as 9%**.  As part of this program, it may take up to 7 days for you to withdraw  any crypto from your account. Voyager Digital is engaging in fractional  lending practices, which banks have been doing for centuries.\n\nLast March, **Voyager acquired Circle Internet Financial\u2019s trading app**,  which provided an additional 40,000 clients. The acquisition  strengthens Voyager in offering the USDC stable coin that has $7 billion  in circulation. Circle is backed by Goldman Sachs and is the founder of  the consortium for USDC. The USDC coin allows global transfer of  dollars at an instant and for a very low transaction cost. The stable  coin is part of a consortium that is also sponsored by Baidu, IDG  Capital and Bitmain with participation on trading apps, such as Voyager  and Coinbase. The supply of USDC has grown by 41% since the start of  2020. A recently announced acquisition of France-based digital asset  exchange **LGOUY** expands Voyager Digital\u2019s reach into **Europe**.\n\n**RISKS**\n\nIt  would not be a proper analysis on a crypto exchange unless we discussed  the risks involved. Hacks that result in a loss of assets are no longer  as likely due to enhanced security measures and custodians. Yet it  bears mentioning that **Mt. Gox was hacked**  in 2014. At the time of the hack, Mt. Gox was the largest crypto  exchange globally, handling around 70% of all transactions worldwide,  totaling $3 billion. The hack resulted in a loss of about 6% of all  bitcoins in existence at the time. The company went bankrupt, as all  remaining assets were frozen. An investor who held their crypto at the  Mt. Cox exchange lost most, if not all, of their investment. **Voyager** Digital was **hacked**  as recently as December of 2020, but no customer data or assets were  lost as the company shut down its systems when the vulnerability was  detected. **Cryptocurrencies do not come with FDIC or SPIC insurance**.  FDIC protects depositors from banks becoming insolvent, providing  guaranteed insurance of up to $250,000. The SPIC protects investors from  a broker-dealer going bankrupt, providing insurance up to $500,000 in  the unlikely occurrence of a broker-dealer becoming insolvent.\n\nCounterparty  risk is a reality for any crypto investor holding their coins at an  exchange/custodian. If a custodian does not segregate coins and provide  unique private keys that the company cannot access, the risk remains  that an investor could lose a portion of their coins in the event of  insolvency.\n\nThis happened to **BitGrail**  in 2019, an Italian exchange. The courts declared that because all  crypto deposits were directed towards the primary address of the  exchange, and were not segregated, it was impossible to determine the  coins\u2019 ownership. Thus, the remaining coins were used to pay off  creditors, **wiping out most of the individual investors** using that exchange.\n\n**To be clear, we don\u2019t think this will happen with Voyager**  but are providing a 360-degree view of the risks. We think the crypto  landscape has become much more secure since Mt. Gox and BitGrail, and  these old stigmas prevent many investors from participating in this  sweeping trend.\n\n**Voyager**  Digital is a thinly traded over-the-counter (OTC) stock. The OTC  markets come with higher risk as there are no central brokers compared  to stocks traded on the Nasdaq. As a small cap OTC stock tied to crypto  moves, Voyager promises to be a roller-coaster ride.\n\nThere  is a report on **Bitcoin** and **Altcoins** by **Ray Dalio of Bridgewater**   published in Jan 2021 which is a fascinating read and I would like to   add that report to the RISK section of this post. Here is the complete   report:\n\n[https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/our-thoughts-on-bitcoin](https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/our-thoughts-on-bitcoin)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nVoyager Digital\u2019s growth is largely undetected by the market at this time and we think this is a boon to investors. With **Goldman Sachs** leading the IPO, **Coinbase**  will be fully priced by the time it hits the market and we are not keen  on direct listings as they did not perform well for retailers if we  look at Spotify and Slack. At that price and under those terms, we will  not be considering Coinbase as we feel our money is better spent on  other stocks, crypto and blockchain companies that are less hyped. In  our opinion, Voyager is a serious competitor to Coinbase \u2013 and most  certainly to Robinhood. For our goals and desired gains in the I/O fund,  we will take the 10 forward P/S on a company growing rapidly rather  than an overpriced DPO at a much higher valuation.\n\nIf the above was not too long and anyone interested in reading the full article go here:\n\n[https://beth.technology/why-were-skipping-coinbase-and-prefer-voyager-digital-overview-of-crypto-trading/](https://beth.technology/why-were-skipping-coinbase-and-prefer-voyager-digital-overview-of-crypto-trading/)\n\nI am not a financial advisor so trade at your own risk!",

            "text": "Yesterday was Token unlocking time for Avax (Avalanche).\n\nWhile we were waiting for an important dump, the whales and Avax enthousiasts held strong.\n\nAvax is on the rise, and expected to go up an up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is (AVAX) Avalanche?**\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) is a highly scalable, cross-chain-interoperable, hyper-deflationary, and unboundedly decentralized cryptocurrency protocol that allows for complex smart contracts, extremely cheap, fast, and reliable transactions, and subchains with custom virtual machines, validator rulesets, and token economics.\n\nYou can launch your own private and public blockchains on top of the Avalanche platform, and either integrate the native AVAX asset, issue your own asset, or both! Within this developer toolset, you can do unique and highly niche-oriented things, such as place geographical and technical restrictions on who can be a validator, integrate decentralized oracles into the governance layer of your blockchain, and design new proof-of-concepts that are integrated with the highly robust and efficient Avalanche consensus engine.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) comes equipped with the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) on its C-Chain, the infrastructure to launch new custom blockchains on its P-Chain, and support for UTXO based usecases on its X-Chain. All of these separate chains synergestically work together to create one whole system, and all utilize the same AVAX asset, through decentralized protocol-level cross-chain atomic swaps. Your custom subchain can tap into this network effect in order to create new experimental concepts that Avalanche can benefit from.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) is also designed to be very deflationary, with both a hardcoded max supply cap and by having 100% of all fees on the three primary chains burned. The fee-burn model is superior for security and economically aligned validator incentives, and also allows holders to capture the value create by Avalanche apps through usage-driven deflation. Economic constants that aren't hardcoded (such as fee prices), are parameterized so that validators can vote to change them in reliable and structured time intervals.\n\nAvalanche retains maximal decentralization through the nature of its efficient consensus engine, which results on subsequently added nodes not weighing down the system's scalability much if at all. Testnets have showed that Avalanche has been able to sustain upwards of thousands of validators while being stress tested. The goal is to eventually have tens of thousands and possibly even millions of validators, all of which participate in the block production process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why Do We Need Avalanche?**\n\nMoney is currently controlled by central entities, being held at fractional reserve by banks, and being printed by governments. Governments are able to print so much that they can devalue a currency to nothing, and even if they don't, you can still lose 2%, 5%, 10%, or more every year. This money goes to funding programs you may not morally agree with, and this inflation extends beyond the taxation that was voted or formally decided into existence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ecosystem Development: Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge, Pangolin, and More :**\n\nThe Avalanche ecosystem took the next leap forward with the [**launch of the Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge**](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/94159/bridge-avalanche-ethereum-defi-networks)**,** [**Pangolin**](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/pangolin-a-community-driven-dex-for-avalanche-and-ethereum-assets-6526e6ccea5),  and several other DEXes for Avalanche and Ethereum assets. Unlike many  other high ranked coins that barely support asset transfers, Avalanche  is currently the only decentralized chain that fully supports the EVM,  with many millions of dollars\u2019 worth of digital assets on top. It is the  place where cross-chain DeFi is taking place, with fast finality, high  throughput, and significantly lower transaction fees. \n\nIn the same time period, a number of integrations were announced:\n\n* [Congress of Mexican State of Quintana Roo](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/congress-of-the-mexican-state-of-quintana-roo-uses-avalanche-to-optimize-transparency-in-its-8ed495202b43) \u2014 first government publicly using Avalanche\n* [TrueUSD](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/trueusd-launches-natively-on-avalanche-bringing-us-dollar-liquidity-to-its-defi-ecosystem-37254c25171) \u2014 one of the largest and most trusted fiat-backed stablecoins\n* [Injective Protocol](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/injective-is-integrating-with-avalanche-to-launch-a-diverse-array-of-interoperable-derivatives-43233b0b198f?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------) \u2014 decentralized derivatives (and Mark Cuban [favorite](https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1362427956107345924?s=20))\n* [Copper](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/copper-integrates-avalanche-to-bolster-institutional-grade-storage-and-trading-security-for-avax-f104b9d24b?source=collection_home---4------7-----------------------) \u2014 institutional custody & trading\n* [Axelar](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/axelar-expanding-its-cross-chain-communication-network-to-connect-avalanche-with-other-leading-1499b2ac7fb4) \u2014 cross-chain communication\n* [Router Protocol](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/router-protocol-expanding-liquidity-access-to-avalanche-defi-community-e1a1a26efdd) \u2014 cross-chain liquidity routing\n* [Coin98](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/coin98-wallet-integrates-avalanche-and-its-native-tokens-5733ac168df3) \u2014 one of the most popular wallets in southeast Asia\n* [Frontier](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/frontier-begins-multi-function-integration-to-serve-avalanches-defi-ecosystem-ca3b6b15ad86) \u2014 wallet for staking, NFTs, and all native assets.\n* [SIMBA Chain](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/simba-chain-expands-to-avalanche-enabling-low-code-smart-contract-deployment-on-the-internet-of-143bed9bbd2e) \u2014 smart contracts as a service\n* [OIN Finance](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/oin-finance-to-enable-defi-users-to-mint-stablecoins-using-avax-b4f9570c6b49) \u2014 stablecoin and staking derivatives issuance platform\n* [Cartesi ](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/cartesi-integrating-with-avalanche-to-expand-layer-2-infrastructure-within-defi-9abdf29422df)\u2014 Layer-2 DeFi infrastructure\n\nIn  a vacuum, each of these projects brings significant new functionalities  to Avalanche. When combined with the Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge (AEB),  Pangolin, and more applications launching on the platform, however, they  make Avalanche the premier platform for DeFi.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Community Growth :** \n\nThe  Avalanche Community is the cornerstone of the entire project, and a key  driver in making Avalanche a premier platform to build on. Better yet,  it is growing at an unprecedented pace since the start of the year:\n\n* Industry  market data sites CoinMarketCap and Blockfolio have seen AVAX increase  on users\u2019 watchlists by over 3x to more than 55,000 combined.\n* Avalanche  Twitter alone has seen a meteoric rise in new followers, growing over  70% to more than 42,000 followers, while accounts associated with the  project (including prominent team members) have grown to a combined  194,000 followers.\n* Avascan, a third-party block explorer for Avalanche, reported recently almost 150,000 unique monthly active users.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What to Watch For :** \n\nAt a high level, we should all expect to see the most new activity and growth on Avalanche in the following pillars:\n\n* **Wallets \u2014** Wallet  support is vital to expanding the Avalanche ecosystem, and improving  user experience. In Q2, AVAX will be supported by some of the most  downloaded crypto wallets in the world, bringing Avalanche to tens of  millions of new users.\n* **DeFi \u2014** More  applications will be expanding to Avalanche, including cornerstone  functionalities like lending, collateral optimization, decentralized  options, and most crucially fiat onramps for users to seamlessly access  Avalanche\u2019s DeFi ecosystem.\n* **NFTs \u2014** NFTs  will be a huge area for growth on Avalanche, as creators can easily  issue NFTs directly through the Avalanche Wallet. In Q2, we should  anticipate core NFT infrastructure like auction and discovery platforms  coming to Avalanche, and potentially a marquee brand in the collectibles  world.\n* **Listings, Custody & Infrastructure \u2014** Two  major qualified custodians are in the process of integrating with  Avalanche. This will not only enable faster integrations with leading  partners across the world, but also open AVAX to the institutional  marketplace. Furthemore, more major listings, including large U.S.  venues, are expected to be supporting Avalanche in Q2.\n* **Institutions & Enterprises \u2014** The  Ava Labs team is exploring multiple proofs-of-concept with institutions  and enterprises across the financial services, insurance, and  pharmaceutical industries, including two publicly-traded companies.\n* **Crypto Infrastructure \u2014** Developers  building on Avalanche will have more tools at their disposal, including  popular solutions for data charting and smart contract optimizations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2665",

This vote will basicaly determine if EU will enforce identification and regulation of every non-custodial wallets such as Metamask, software wallet, Trezor, Ledger etc. This could lead to exchanges refusing to transfer in or transfer out to wallets, making cryptos very centralized and easily controllable by government and their regulators.\n\nEvery transaction over 1000 EUR is subject to verification, it might even be lowered to 0 EUR, meaning all transactions would have to be verified/authorized by designated authorities.\n\nThis is a huge drawback and will put Europe citizens behind others. This could also become a worldwide policy, giving extra powers to the originators of this request: the US FATF Travel Rule. Instead of taking sovereignety, Europe is following uncle Sam steps again.\n\nImagine how easy it will be for them in the future to blacklist any wallet for not complying to a new model, for participating in a or a convoy for freedom, for raising a concern on twitter, for consuming too much fossile fuel this month, for not contributing financially to Ukraine war etc...\n\n**What is the FATF Travel Rule?**\n\n[https://sumsub.com/blog/what-is-the-fatf-travel-rule/](https://sumsub.com/blog/what-is-the-fatf-travel-rule/)\n\nThis regulation is the equivalent of total control on cash and its planned disappearance.\n\nThis is plain totalitarism disguised under anti money laudering.\n\nThe vote is this thursday, we have to act NOW !\n\nHow to act?

            "text": "The Blockchain has been bifurcating since the development of the whitelist. There is a conundrum wherein crypto startups need to provide some exclusive access to their early investors, but the actual access in itself doesn't have much value so they are essentially giving units (coins/tokens) in preparation for a quick increase after a public sale, which is followed by an inevitable sell off. At this point, the protocol, if it remains attractive to crypto markets, begins to dig itself out of this pre-planned hole. This is the \"no FUD\" period for moderators, and significant frustration for early, but late, retail investors. \n\nI bring this up just to point out that we are clearly recreating the P2P market cycles seen in more conventional markets. This isn't necessary. And it will lead to the inevitable tiered investor development that is common between self directed brokerage accounts and the shielded hedge funds that have seemingly limitless latitude in their fiduciary vehicles.\n\nWhy am I posting this on Crypto Markets? Frankly, it's a small enough sub that a productive conversation is possible. But, more importantly, investors come to this sub for info to help them  decide where to park their crypto. Of course, not in a financial advise sort of way... But still, from the viewpoint of a single retail investor, it seems like we are ignoring the deterioration of the market if we don't call out the machinery that devalues markets: private sales, botting, non-custodial platforms/wallets, and predatory marketing (think celebrity endorsed shit coin).\n\nWe have a chance to do it differently. Think of it like a solo server on Rust... think of it like single deck black jack. \n\nHow do we build that? All viewpoints are welcome.",

            "text": "So what, you thought it was all over? There you were thinking, \u2018ah finally, a return to normality\u2019 after two years where the world\u2019s governments panicked into what have turned out to be mostly ineffective, but often ruthlessly enforced policies for \u2018our own benefit\u2019. \r\n\r\nWell, more fool you if you did, but then, you probably should have paid more attention during history lessons at school. For centuries, the greatest minds have tried to warn us about the nature of government, which is, ultimately to concentrate power in the hands of a few. \r\n\r\nBut before you begin to assume, this article isn\u2019t about Covid. Far from it. Covid was simply the beginning sniffles of a much larger malady, and one which is being played out right now, especially in the Western world, where the average person still thinks they have freedom and liberty. \r\n\r\nNo, on the contrary, this article is about the split in the timelines which is occurring right in front of your face. It\u2019s about the paths we individually and collectively choose to go down, and what that means for our future. And at its root is one simple question: Who controls your money?\r\n\r\nWhilst I\u2019m going to talk a lot about Canada here, make no mistake, the same principles are likely to be employed elsewhere, not just in countries where one expects dictators to show their true colors, but also where you\u2019d historically expect at least some level of individual liberty.  \r\n\r\nCanada Has Fallen? Maybe Hyperbolic, but Trudeau! \r\n\r\nSo, The Canadian government has finally used its power to crush the Freedom Convoy, as we knew it eventually would. \r\n\r\nThere was no negotiation. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not once decide to go and speak to the truckers and their supporters with the aim of negotiating a satisfactory end to the protests. \r\n\r\nInstead, he simply went through the increasing stages of authoritarianism, beginning with slandering them, to then threatening them with varying forms of ever-increasing social ostracization, and finally sending in riot police to violently crush non-violent dissenters (in the case of some, quite literally, under rifle butts and cavalry hooves). \r\n\r\nBut one of the most menacing strategies which the authorities employed is the frightening use of economic terrorism, both as a weapon with which to label the protesters, but also as a tool to crush dissent. \r\n\r\nBank accounts were frozen, assets seized, and even cryptocurrency held in centralized exchanges was effectively stolen by the government, without due process. \r\n\r\nSome of those who were financially frozen out weren\u2019t even present at the protests in person, but have been targeted for simply giving a few dollars in support to the protesters from afar.   \r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic violence: The final arbiter\r\n\r\nIn the modern age, when a belligerent nation invades a neighbor or behaves in what richer, (normally Western countries) deem to be a violation of sovereignty, sanctions are often the screw which turns to pressure the antagonist to back down, and effective these financial sanctions quite often are. \r\n\r\nBut what happens when your adversary happens to be your own people, the people who overwhelmingly elected you, and now they are protesting the legislation you have put in place? \r\n\r\nYes, certainly guns and jackboots are very effective at crushing dissent, but if the willingness to use violence was the one true final arbiter, then most of Europe would have been wearing Swastika\u2019s, and Mahatma Gandhi would have been written into history as a terrorist. \r\n\r\nHumans have proven themselves to be incredibly resilient against pure brute violent force. Every now and again, the peasants\u2019 get annoyed, and decided to revolt, with the response generally causing a few heads roll before the riot is quelled, but ultimately the status-quo is never quite the same, with some concessions generally being made by the powers-that-be to try to stop it happening again. \r\n\r\nBut now, the Trudeau government has decided it\u2019s time to bring out it\u2019s big guns and commit economic terrorism against its own citizens. Thus, the real final arbiter has been established, and it\u2019s not force derived from the barrel of a gun, but rather one committed by the state at the point of a financial Howitzer. \r\n\r\n\r\nNobody is Immune\r\n\r\nPutting aside the use of militaristic riot-police cracking a few heads to bring an end to the Canadian protest, the tactics of preventing individuals from being able to transact in normal society should be a cause for concern for everyone who still thinks that government should serve the people, and not the other way around. \r\n\r\nFor it is this ability that those in authority have to effectively censure people from being able to hold and use money which is where the Trudeau regime has essentially crossed the Rubicon. \r\n\r\nIf a person cannot safely exchange for goods and services, if they have their assets taken from them on the whim of the government, without the benefit of due process, the logical conclusion is that these people cannot buy the basic essentials of life, and thus they suffer a pernicious form of financially driven murder, as they are rendered an Orwellian un-person at the press of a button. \r\n\r\nAnd nobody is immune, whilst the world relies on centralized money to function. \r\n\r\nPeople who have never been financially cancelled have never really thought about their money before. Seemingly, most of us assume that the money in our bank accounts is ours, and we can get to it whenever we need, and thanks very much for the simple tools which mean we don\u2019t have to carry cash around with us. \r\n\r\nWe have, all of us, been slowly indoctrinated to be part of this system of financial insecurity, where at any time, we can be economically exterminated at any time the government feels threatened.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe World Economic Forum Terror\r\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not just limited to Canada. Trudeau is a member of the benign-sounding, yet thoroughly malevolent World Economic Forum (WEF).  If you don\u2019t know the WEF, headed by Klaus Schwab, is a supra-governmental organization which is driving globalism by any means. One of its ways of achieving this has been to \u201cpenetrate\u201d governments by sponsoring it\u2019s acolytes to achieve high political status: according to Schwab\u2019s own very public boast, at least half of the Canadian government is made up of WEF members. \r\n\r\nThe WEF\u2019s master plan, the Great Reset (recently rebranded to the Great Narrative) presents a disturbing world, a dystopian society which looks very much like a techno-feudalism where Billionaire technocrats rule the world, and everyone else is effectively a serf. \r\n\r\nThis is their utopia, and it\u2019s not a tin-foil hat conspiracy theory spun by raging YouTube personalities just for clicks: It\u2019s basically all laid out in Schwab\u2019s own books, as well as being peddled by world leaders on a daily basis (most of whom are, of course, WEF members). \r\n\r\nIn this society, the catchphrase (and ominous warning to anyone paying attention) is that \u201cyou will own nothing, and be happy\u201d (they may as well have gone on to add the word \u201cpeasant\u201d at the end of the phrase). \r\n\r\nIn the WEF\u2019s utopia, all money is digital and your access to it is ultimately at the whim of the elites. If you don\u2019t behave, you can be switched off. Poof\u2026.gone. No more ability to buy a car, a house, even groceries. You are literally removed from society. You become an un-person. It doesn\u2019t mention what happens to those who are switched off, but if you can\u2019t buy what you need to live, it\u2019s fair to assume you don\u2019t live much longer. \r\n\r\nDo you think this could never happen? Well, it already is. In China, the great communist state already has a social credit system, where every \u2018citizen\u2019 is tracked, with their behavior and spending is continuously examined and rated, with punishments ensuing for those who don\u2019t comply with the \u2018accepted norms\u2019. \r\n\r\nAnd now, of course, we can add peaceful, liberal, rational Canada to the list of states which are happy to evict citizens from money. \r\n\r\nThis goes way beyond automatically citations for breaking the law, and includes bot issued (and collected) public morality violations which were humorously portrayed in the 1993 film Demolition Man. Almost thirty years after this movie premiered, and here we are watching life imitate art, again. \r\n\r\nIt will come as no surprise that pretty much all banks will immediately comply if the government \u2018requests\u2019 they freeze the assets of any of their customers. Banks don\u2019t really care if they leave their customers unable to access their own money, just so long as the government doesn\u2019t get annoyed with them, because that would be very bad for business. \r\n\r\n\r\nCryptocurrency and Liberty\r\n\r\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, the first decentralized peer-to-peer digital currency, for the first time in human history, there was a chance for ordinary people to free themselves from the shackles of the fraudulent financial house of cards upon which national economies were built. They did this by being their own bank. They held and controlled their Bitcoin, not anyone else, and it didn\u2019t require you to seek permission from any authority to use or hold. \r\n\r\nGovernments, especially authoritarian ones, really don\u2019t like Bitcoin, for the simple reason that it cannot be controlled by them. Over the last few years, many other cryptocurrencies have emerged, with wide-ranging applications beyond just that of being decentralized digital money. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been this decentralized liberty which many people love about cryptocurrency. Having the ability to keep your money out of the reach of those in authority is very appealing, especially for those people who have a somewhat more skeptical view of government. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Apathy of Cryptocurrency Holders\r\n\r\nHowever, cryptocurrency has for many years had a fatal flaw in terms of usability, and this flaw was found in the centralized crypto exchanges upon which many of the transactions occur. People have been encouraged to hold their crypto on these exchanges, and just like banks, convenience has once again been key to marketing this idea of actually giving up the control of your crypto. \r\n\r\nConvenience, perhaps, but apathy is probably more accurate, as users are ultimately the ones responsible for not bothering to bring their crypto back into the relative safety of their own privately controlled wallets, out of the reach of any institution. \r\n\r\nCentralized crypto exchanges in many ways act like banks. They hold their users\u2019 funds on their behalf, and require practically the same identity verification as traditional financial institutions in order to access services. They are also regulated by a financial authority (in other words, they are allowed to exist only at the whim of the government), and just like banks, are required to report on anything deemed to be \u201csuspicious\u201d.\r\n\r\nOf course, governments have allowed these exchanges to grow and flourish, probably because they were aware that, at any point, they could simply demand the executives comply with any-and-all diktats decreed by the administration, on pain of having their regulatory licenses revoked if they failed to do as they were instructed. \r\n\r\nAlongside traditional banking institutions, these exchanges were targeted by the Trudeau regime in their quest to bestow financial blacklisting on their own citizens, with almost all immediately bending the knee to comply with the demands of the increasingly authoritarian government. \r\n\r\nMillions of dollars-worth of crypto was seized by the Canadian government, stealing the funds from ordinary citizens who had committed no crime (or even if the administration said they had, had not been given the privilege of any due process or right to a fair trial of their peers). \r\n\r\nRegardless of the legality, morality or otherwise of these actions, it has happened now, and it\u2019s unlikely the people whose financial existence has effectively been wiped out will see their funds returned, even if the Canadian Supreme Court decides to rule Trudeau\u2019s \u2018emergency powers\u2019 unconstitutional. \r\n\r\n\r\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies: It\u2019s crypto, but not as you know it. \r\n\r\nHowever, the story doesn\u2019t end there. Whilst authoritarians dislike crypto which they can\u2019t control, they do like the technology that underpins it. In fact, blockchain, the technology which powers cryptocurrency, is so interesting to them that almost all of them are investigating rolling out their own digital currencies, called Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC\u2019s). \r\n\r\nThese are effectively cryptocurrencies, with one major difference; they aren\u2019t controlled by their user communities or by smart algorithms which guarantee nobody controls your funds but you, instead they are issued and controlled by the central banks. \r\n\r\nThis provides the governments all the benefits of blockchain technology but without the headache of not being able to have full control of the lives of the people should they so desire it. \r\n\r\n\r\nDecentralized Stablecoins can save democracy.\r\n\r\nHad the funds belonging to the victims of Canada\u2019s over-reaching government sanctioned theft held their cryptocurrency in decentralized wallets, there would have been nothing the government could do, except bluster. There was no literally way of seizing the crypto of people who controlled their own keys. \r\n\r\nIndeed, decentralization and the very act of controlling your own keys is the hedge against authoritarian government. It\u2019s probably one of the very last bastions of true liberty in this modern age. \r\n\r\nHowever, cryptocurrency has a problem which makes it unsuitable for use in daily life at present. It is notoriously volatile, with large price movements occurring regularly. Not only that, literally thousands of different crypto\u2019s have been created, each with unique and different properties, and with new ones coming out daily, it\u2019s hard to pin down one which could act as an alternative and widely accepted currency for general transactions. \r\n\r\nThis makes most cryptocurrencies effectively unusable as a means of general daily payment. Imagine you agreed to buy something with crypto in a shop; by the time you had completed the transaction, the value of the token you were sending would likely have moved, leaving one side of the transaction out of pocket. \r\n\r\nThe key to digital currency being useful in modern life is a cryptocurrency which has essentially the same value as the nationally accepted currency, but which is held only in a wallet that was inaccessible to the authorities\u2026essentially what we refer to as a decentralized stablecoin. \r\n\r\nA stablecoin holds its value. It\u2019s easy to understand what it is currently worth, because one token is equal to one US dollar. Therefore, customers and merchants alike understand exactly what they are getting in return for providing goods and services, and the funds are beyond the reach of the state or other institutions. \r\n\r\nBringing it all together\r\n\r\nThose who have been in the cryptocurrency world for a long time generally understand one very important principle, that decentralized money, out of the control of banks and governments, is the holy grail which ensures true financial liberty. \r\n\r\nCryptocurrencies issued by central banks however do not. This is one of the goals of the World Economic Forum and its globalist neophytes. A single currency, centrally controlled by them, forced upon everyone. What could possibly go wrong? \r\n\r\nThis is the crossroads that the world stands upon right now. If we continue to choose the path of apathy, the likelihood of a tyrannical, centrally controlled, financial \u2018Sword of Damacles\u2019 hangs over all our heads. \r\n\r\nIf we apathetically continue down this path, we will literally be giving our economic wellbeing over to a tiny group of ultra-wealthy psychopaths who just love power, and who wish to control every aspect of your life. \r\n\r\nNeither is the alternative just Bitcoin, as some maximalists would argue, or even cryptocurrency in general, because there exist fundamental barriers to their adoption as a general-purpose means of exchange. \r\n\r\nFor ordinary people to become part of the global revolution against financial tyranny imposed by dictators, the only viable solution at present are fully decentralized stablecoins, essentially representations of existing currencies which we are already familiar with. \r\n\r\nThese exist beyond the fickle hand of rulers and leaders whose allegiance is demonstrably not to the people who elected them, but to their shadowy masters in the WEF and other globalist organizations (which not a single person on the planet has ever voted for). They are, as the name suggests, stable, and most importantly, are controlled by each of us individually. \r\n\r\nThis is the real rebellion, one in which everyone can participate, and it doesn\u2019t require you to weather the elements, the batons and tear gas, in order to make your protest effective. This is the one revolutionary act which the government can do nothing about, and which, if we all did it, would neuter the tyrants completely, and free us all from the threat of financial terrorism. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical. Unsuccessful rebellions indeed generally establish the encroachments on the rights of the people which have produced them.\u201d\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON",

            "text": "We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.\n\n  \n\n**TLDR**: Strategies are presented here to create basic positions from which you can explore other new strategies. As mentioned, options strategies allow the creation of positions with the risk aversion level from the investor's demands. Using the strategy as a hedge, it is necessary to consider whether your position is suitable or not.\n\n**Get smarter:** Not any asset has options based on it. However, we can design our own to make contracts that closely resembles an asset we hold with another asset. Of course, the complexity and number of transactions also increase, they reduce profit by cost.\n\n# General Conclusion\n\nOne of the most attractive feature of options is that it can be a combination of options or combined with other derivatives to create a variety of strategies. The possibilities for profit can be so varied that almost any investor can find a strategy that meets their preferred level of risk and is in line with the market forecast.\n\nWithout options, the strategies are very limited. If the assets are expected to increase, people would buy the stocks; if they are expected to decrease, people would sell them. Choice makes the move from forecasting to a profitable action plan, if the forecast is correct. Of course, the strategy will punish you for incorrect prediction. However, with the correct use of options, the punishment will be quite small and predictable.\n\nIn this newsletter, we will introduce some simple option strategies that you can apply easily. These strategies are the easiest to understand and require the least transaction.\n\n# Covered Call Option strategy\n\n>**TLDR:** I have $ETH. I sell options for $ETH so people can buy $ETH when prices increase. I get money upfront. I lose the infinite upside.\n\n## Who will use this strategy?\n\n### Own Asset\n\nYou have people who own the asset, say $ETH. In crypto space, we have two types of people. The first type is people who just have $ETH as an investment and keep it in their wallets. I'm looking at you, institutional investors.\n\nThe second type is people who are liquidity providers to protocols like HEGIC, OPYN.\n\n### Sell Call Option\n\nFor people who are liquidity providers, this is where you will be selling a call option.\n\nCrash course: call option is basically the ability for someone else to buy your ETH. You're selling the possibility for someone to buy this asset (ETH) from you at a different price.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's say ETH right now is worth $1800 and you want to sell this call option. The strike price is $1950 and they have to pay a premium of $100. Let's say ETH becomes $2200.\n\nBecause someone bought the call option from you, they can go to you and buy at $1950 because you've already made a promise. The benefit for you is that you received this $100 premium no matter what. This premium is why people want to be option sellers as they get to earn some money.\n\n### How does this strategy help to manage risk?\n\nThis is money upfront whether ETH goes to $2200 or ETH drops to $1000. Whatever happens to ETH doesn't matter because I have this $100 upfront.\n\n#",

            "text": "I know so much more now than when I first started about 11 months ago. I thought it would be cool to share some shortcuts for other people who are in the same boat as me.\n\n1.When sending a large transaction(everything is relative!), always make a test transaction first. Everybody knows to double-check the wallet address and chain but we\u2019re humans and bound to make mistakes. I\u2019ve messed up my transactions before so now I always do a test (transferring a tiny amount of money first) for big transactions.\n\n2. Bookmark exchange sites to avoid fake sites. People can buy ads so that their copycat site shows up above the real site. This is especially common in google ads. Don't click those ads for exchanges or defi projects!\n\n3. Sites like [CoinMarketCap](https://pasteboard.co/OtGvNYjzTUeV.png) and [DropsEarn](https://dropsearn.com/airdrops/) have a list of free airdrops you can apply for. There are contest/giveaway airdrops and then there are \"use our protocol\" airdrops. Understand the difference before you get your hopes up. For contest/giveaways you simply need to follow a few social media accounts plus a retweet to qualify.\n\n4.Crypto screener sites can help you find new trading opportunities or confirm whether your positions are strong or not. I like to use [CoinRotator](https://www.coinrotator.app/) because it settles on a position (buy, sell, or hodl) by comparing the coin\u2019s performance against BTC, ETH and USDT. I used it to exit a few of my lucky winners from earlier in the year on AXS and SOL.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7t3rsug4ei81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=65b3709d10f13c1affad5cc2611d86932f5dc7b6\n\n5. Scams are happening all the time so stay alert always. This [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/quvhd5/are_you_a_crypto_newbie_heres_an_updated_list_of/) I saw a while ago details many of them. These scams can range from someone downloading an old livestream from Coinbase, Apple, Binance, huge huge names, then stream it on their Youtube/Facebook account; to random Redditors dm-ing you saying they were impressed by how smart and knowledgeable your Reddit posts/comments are and they want to work with you.\n\nSome of the tips are probably common sense but who knows. We learn by teaching. Perhaps you have some tips to share with others as well. Not every post needs to be about new coins or calling out scammers. Crypto is an adventure to me and I am enjoying the ride (so far.)",

            "text": "**Preface:**\n\nI came across this coin from a anti-rebase post on DeFi from the founder of this coin. Through deep diving and doing my own research I have came to the conclusion that this is the coin I would bet comes out on top as one of the top tokens of 2022. I have done the research so you don't have to. I will admit, while asking the Founder questions and tearing apart every angle I could in the discord, I was offered a mod position in the discord. Other than the trivial mod roles I have no previous or current affiliations with the project team and I have invested in this protocol. As always, this is only my opinion and not financial advice.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI would like to start by introducing the founder. The reason why I want to start with this is that so many of the coins listed here have anonymous teams or they are \"doxxed\" by some auditing team that we are forced to trust. With many of these devs and founders located in different counties with much different crypto laws (or none at all) it makes the \"doxxing\" almost useless as in the event someone decides to exit scam we still really have no one to hold accountable.\n\nThe founder for this coin/protocol is Andrew Eddy, a US based sole-founder who's background is in web development, Economics, and having ran real businesses at the highest level(CEO) with his previous endeavor Sequr. His LinkedIn can be found here: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-eddy-75a63337](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-eddy-75a63337) A little off-topic but the man has been bit by a shark. You can find the inside edition story on this at: [https://www.insideedition.com/aftermath-of-terrifying-shark-attack-captured-in-newly-released-bodycam-video-62353](https://www.insideedition.com/aftermath-of-terrifying-shark-attack-captured-in-newly-released-bodycam-video-62353)\n\nFew things to digest here.\n\n1. He is U.S. based meaning he abides by US law and regulation\n2. He is real and not just a \"dev\" behind a \"great idea\"\n3. He has the skills and experience to back up this protocol\n4. He has been bitten by a shark.\n\nOk now onto a look inside the protocol. I'm going to split this into two sections; The road less traveled(V1) and The Vision(V2)\n\n**The Road Less traveled:**\n\nThe team developing this protocol has really thought of the current state of events(Time/Wonderland) as well as the future with the initial implementations at launch. The reason this is titled as the road less traveled is that many of these mechanisms have been implemented in traditional finance and economic fields yet has either been poorly implemented or not implemented at all in the world of crypto. So the road has been paved before but has not been traveled in this space quite like this. As with any new project this base foundation is meant to be built on. However this base in itself is of great value and even without v2 would supply a high mcap once it has picked up steam. As said before, A-lot of this has not ever been done before in DeFi. To any investor this presents a huge untapped value of a token on a pioneering front. Below are the mechanisms that have launched with the protocol in V1.\n\n*Fair + Stealth Launch*\n\n$Novo Token is launched with no VC allocation, no pre-mine, no ICO/IDO, no private sale or seed round. Novo has decided that the simplest and most fair way to start would be by providing liquidity and opening up trading of the token on a Dex. No announcements or marketing were done ahead of the token launch. This launch happened a mere 3 weeks ago. with only 315 unique wallet addresses at the time of this post it makes it one of the stealthiest and fair launches I have seen yet.\n\nI. *Tokenomics*\n\nStarting Supply (Max): 1,000,000,00\n\nPublic Supply: 500,000,000 Treasury (Liquidity & Staking Rewards): 450,000,000 Lab (Project Growth): 50,000,000\n\nII. *Volume based protocol*\n\nCurrently until temporal staking is live (explanation of how this works is further down) NOVO has a 5% transaction fee or tax. 2.5% is being sent back to the holders via reflections while the other 2.5% is sent to a staking address. Once TS and the dApp are live this staking address will distribute the rewards to the first round of stakers in the protocol OR sent to a burn address. This is still being decided on by the team.\n\nIII. *Anti-Whale mechanism*\n\nBesides the wallets running the protocol (Treasury, Staking/rewards, and growth) No one wallet can hold more than 0.5% or 5,000,000 Novo. As you can expect this relatively easy to counteract with just using multiple wallets however, as price of this coin increases it makes whales abilities to pump and dump the coin as the transaction fees along with this feature make it incredibly hard to create any arbitrage opportunity as it is needed to be done over multiple wallets and very costly. In turn in any event this happens holders are rewarded with the fees generated by the volume (any volume is good volume with this protocol) and the treasury is also rewarded which increases the ability of the price recovery method with-in the protocols infrastructure (this will be explained in more detail below)\n\nIV. *Smart treasury*\n\nCurrently the treasury is auto converted to BNB and deposited into yield compounders through stable coin single side staking and/or stable coin LP pairs. This diversifies the treasury across multiple over-collateralized stable coins and operates different than a traditional treasury as its not held in its native token.\n\nV. *Price recovery method.*\n\nIn the event of a bear market the treasury can buy NOVO on the open market. The most important function of the Treasury is to perform PRM's which is Price Recovery Mechanism's. An example would be the Novo Treasury buying NOVO from the market to combat prolonged bear market exposure. This is where the part of the fees from the transactions going to the smart treasury comes into place. With more volume (even on the sell side in a bear market) The treasury becomes stronger and stronger.\n\nAll of the above have been implemented on NOVO's launch. As you can see the base implementation of this coin is already unique and provides holders to invest with confidence. A-lot of this is already used by economists and governments around the world. All rewards and mechanisms are backed by something with REAL value. Not \"printed\" or made up as we have seen with rebase tokens with their native coin.\n\n**The Vision (V2)**\n\nAs I pointed out in the intro, this protocol not only has a great starting base layer but also the roadmap and future implementations only build and compound on the original foundation. Some topics will have the same label as V1. This is because with some of the other things implemented the original basis will be able to operate even more efficient but typically in the same manor as before.\n\nI. *Volume based protocol*\n\nNifty visual breakdown: [https://imgur.com/QZ9e96Q](https://imgur.com/QZ9e96Q)\n\nOn a transaction of $1000 there will be a 5% transaction fee. Within this transaction fee $20(40%) goes to the liquidity pool, $5(10%) is burned/removed from the supply, $5 goes into the treasury(10%), with the remaining $5(10%) going straight to the staking pool.In the event this is transfered a 2% fee will be applied with the same breakdown.\n\nAs you can see this is very lucrative for the holders of NOVO. However, You are probably asking your self how an why are people going to transact novo so we can reap the sweet rewards? The answer to that question lies in the Pilars of utility outlined in the documents provided on their website. I'll list and explain below and elaborate on the more in depth aspects:\n\nII. *Temporal staking*\n\nThis one is something I really love and levels the playing field between all types of holders. I'm going to link straight to NOVO's website to explain this as there is an algorithm at play and it is different than your traditional staking methods. This will all happen within NOVOs dApp which is soon to be released.\n\nTemporal Staking: [https://novo-2.gitbook.io/welcome-to-gitbook/rest-and-reflect-aka-temporal-staking](https://novo-2.gitbook.io/welcome-to-gitbook/rest-and-reflect-aka-temporal-staking)\n\nThe general idea is to give everyone a fair chance. To do this time staked is taken into the traditional equation and weighted along side the amount. This gives early adopters and loyalty to the protocol a piece of the pie where as with traditional staking whoever owns more of the liquidity is typically issued the most rewards. Once you un-stake your time resets and the people below you move up the ladder to higher time staked rewards.\n\nIII. *Smart Treasury V2*\n\nThis be the same as above except instead done manually it will be done via a liquidity advisor and smart contracts. NOVO realizes liquidity in the staking pool along side returns are what drives the strength of the treasury. Making this automated with set parameters along side an advisor who measures just how liquid the treasury is so NOVO can effectively launch PRMs is a huge win for the protocol in my book.\n\nIV. *Pillars of utility*\n\nSource: [https://novo-2.gitbook.io/welcome-to-gitbook/pillars-of-utility](https://novo-2.gitbook.io/welcome-to-gitbook/pillars-of-utility)\n\n* Pillar #1 - Temporal Staking: This is more than liquidity farming. Although we value liquidity, Novo doesn\u2019t have a need for your liquidity. In fact, one of our greatest sources of income is our ability to provide liquidity. Temporal staking represents a commitment to the protocol that is measured and rewarded differently than other staking contracts. By staking your Novo and locking them in a smart contract, you are providing two things, stability to the project, and liquidity outside of our ecosystem. You will receive additional rewards from transactions that are earmarked specifically for stakers. This is where things get interesting. What happens next is a good segway into Pillar #2, Proxy Growth.\n* Pillar #2 - Proxy Growth: When you stake Novo, something we call rest and reflect, you are doing more than solidifying your share of the rewards, you are actively participating in other DeFi protocols. If a user stakes $100 worth of Novo, the Treasury uses $100 worth of BNB (or the native token of whatever chain you are using) and does one or more of the following functions: Stakes to Yield Optimizers such as Beefy.Finance Liquidity farming and AMM projects Additional Yield Farming opportunities Your staked Novo represents value and we don\u2019t want to lock it, we want to amplify it for our holders, in a passive and (eventually) automated way. In other words, you can have your stake (think cake) and eat it too. But thats not all. There are more ways your staked Novo are earning. This takes us to Pillar #3, Treasury Yields.\n* Pillar #3 - Treasury Yields: The Novo Smart Treasury has a lot of jobs, but none more important than that of its job to earn. The treasury is the majority owner of liquidity. It earns a percentage of fees from transacted Novo across AMMs. The Treasury also receives a small portion of fees directly from volume. The treasury also receives ecosystem fees such as those derived from Novo Pay (Pillar #4) and future product releases. The Treasury earns for the protocol and distributes the earnings to the protocol via the stakers. Now let\u2019s discuss Pillar #4, Novo Pay.\n* Pillar #4 - Novo Pay: We believe our greatest derivation of volume will come from one of our simplest products, Novo Pay. Novo Pay is a fiat to token onboarding solution meant for easy implementation in a project's Dapp. Novo Pay allows projects (including our own) to purchase a token listed only on a DEX directly with a credit/debit card. All in one module, any project can handle payment processing and KYC with all the regulatory requirements solved for and taken care of. Until buying tokens from new projects is easy, DeFi and Crypto as a whole can not grow to its full potential. Novo Pay solves that problem. Novo Pay used NOVO token to swap fiat to whatever coin available. This in turn will lower the barrier of entry for common people to get into DeFi. Everything they need is on-ramped easily and wrapped in one token. However if they wish to buy another token on Novo pay the swap will take place via novo to BNB for example. So if you have been following along until now you will realize this is a huge volume driver and rewards mechanism for holders of NOVO.\n* Pillar #5 - Blockchain Agnosticism: Novo in its current state is a token on Binance Smart Chain or BSC. A lot of people wonder why we chose BSC and our answer is twofold. The first, and more obvious reason, is that it is fast and cheap. This is DeFi and people need to move funds, approve staking contracts, and be flexible. Obviously, given the current state of affairs on Ethereum, it was not a viable option. The second reason we chose BSC is that we knew it wasn\u2019t going to be our final destination, and would simply serve as a good starting chain for us. From day one, we have been quietly building a system to accomplish true blockchain agnosticism. Rather than minting and burning tokens, we are implementing bridge lockers that allow cross-chain transactions and support one overall supply. Which additional chains we add first will be up to the community. Achieving a single, unified supply is only the first step in true agnosticism. The second challenge, a more daunting task, is to implement a unified staking and reward mechanism that interacts with the Novo smart treasury on a protocol level, rather than a blockchain level. With the right execution, blockchain agnosticism paves the way for even more Pillars of Utility in the future.\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\nObviously TA is not helpful on a coin that just launched. However, in the current market this coin has been moving well against bitcoin, It has done about 700%+ at the time of this post and has help prices for about a week now while constantly hugging ATH. So yes, I am saying it could go up or it could go down :). Luckily for anyone invested in this token the case remains that currently whatever volume, whether good or bad, means rewards.\n\nThis protocol has the safe and stable things we know and love about DeFi wrapped into it. This significantly lowers the barriers to entry to DeFi and thus makes it a very attractive up and comer. \n\n**Closing statements:**\n\nI have taken a deep dive into a ton of these new coins lately and have followed DeFi for quite a while. This has been one of the very few projects I have seen pop up with actual use. I fully believe this will be the next hot crypto and will be the building block of the future of DeFi. I am simply coming to this sub with the information I have found. I hope this has helped you at-least have a better understanding of this project. What you choose to do with this information is on you.\n\nUseful links:\n\nInterview with the founder done by Defi Enthusiast: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JAmxnB-kwY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JAmxnB-kwY)\n\nWolf of Alt Street AMA with the founder: [https://youtu.be/968XN-qD348](https://youtu.be/968XN-qD348)\n\nNOVO website: [https://www.novodefi.xyz/](https://www.novodefi.xyz/)\n\nNovo Discord: [https://discord.com/invite/CYQkfpF2fc](https://discord.com/invite/CYQkfpF2fc)\n\nCoinGecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/novo](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/novo)\n\nTLDR: CEO is likeable, Tokenomics are impressive, and future prospect looks incredible.

The way you will be able to shop everything through one app and your wallet that is associated with that app is making me think it will become a unique way to shop online.  \n\n\nEven though that isn't still a thing, it's coming in big time! Trust me saying this as I see some apps that are preparing for launch and have this exact idea in mind. I'm talking about apps like Atpay, look it up and it will all be clear to you. Apps whose goal is to become Amazon or eBay-like apps just a lot larger and with many other benefits. Benefits like BNPL (buy now pay later) concept, no fees on your loaned money, plus you get platforms coin as a reward for paying back loan money.  \n\n\nThe future of this is very near and I'd like to hear different opinions on it.",

All this has become available thanks to the magic of modern blockchain technologies that does not stand still and are improving every day.\n\n# About Chives\n\n[Chives coin (XCC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chives-coin/) is a hard fork created by volunteers from the community using the open source code of Chia. Being completely decentralized, without pre-mining, without ICO and an autonomous cryptocurrency, it creates an energy-saving, green and environmentally friendly blockchain system.\n\nThe goal of the project is to create an independent community and a global decentralized payment network using its own cryptocurrency, called Chives or XCC, as the main payment method.\n\nAs a result of the latest update of the Chives network, a new token issuance mechanism, CAT, was inherited.\n\n# What is CAT?\n\nChives Asset Tokens (CAT) is a completely new token issuance standard based on the environmentally friendly Chives blockchain, similar to ERC20 for issuing interchangeable tokens on an ETHERNET network.\n\nCAT tokens are minted from chives coin (XCC) coins and live in the Chives blockchain. The received CAT tokens can be withdrawn from circulation and recycled back into XCC.\n\nIf it is difficult for you to imagine the process of minting and decommissioning CAT, it is worth thinking about copper and coins:\n\n* For example, in the real world, if you have a sheet of copper, you can mint pennies. The nominal value of the received coins is not directly related to the value of the copper from which they are made. With Chives, if you have a small emergency, you can issue SFE tokens, the cost of which is not directly related to the cost of the emergency from which they are made.\n* In the real world, you can also melt coins and get raw copper. In Chives, you can do the same with your tokens and melt them back into XCC.\n\nAny CAT tokens you create must follow the rules you set. You have full creative control over how the token will be put into circulation and how it will be withdrawn from it.\n\nHere are some examples of using CAT tokens:\n\n* A means of payment within your ecosystem or Gamefi project\n* Issuance of stablecoins and meme tokens\n* Issue of shares.\n\n# How do I issue my CAT token?\n\nAnyone can issue their own token based on the Chives blockchain using the CAT standard, while not having programming skills and experience writing smart contracts using the new [Chives Swap](https://chivescoin.net/) functionality, as indicated in the screenshot below:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jnkq4vrurv981.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=85a9dfbd6d8fbde4a943c388045e26e26ccdbdf8\n\n* Visit the website [***chivescoin.net***](https://chivescoin.net/) ***(1)***\n* Expand the ***Chives Asset Tokens*** tab ***(2)***\n* Select ***Issue Token (3)***\n* Enter the address of the chives wallet to which ownership of the tokens will be issued ***(4)***\n* Enter the number of tokens to be issued ***(5)***\n* Enter the code from the mail to confirm the transaction ***(6)*** and click Submit ***(7)***\n\n***For the issue of the token, Chives Swap takes a commission of 2,000 XCC, which at today's exchange rate = $ 22. To issue a token, you will need 2,000 HR + a little emergency for processing from into tokens in the equivalent of 1 HOUR = 100,000 X-tokens.***\n\nCongratulations! You have become the owner of your own token, the success of which will depend on [tokenomics](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/en/article/what-is-tokenomics), the marketing budget and the success of the [ICO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering).\n\nYou can receive and send tokens using the [Chives light wallet](https://github.com/HiveProject2021/chives-light-wallet/releases/).\n\nConclusions\n\nAlong with the global energy crisis, new, environmentally friendly and energy-saving technologies are emerging that are ready to completely replace their predecessors in functionality.\n\nThe Chives blockchain, based on the outstanding Chia source code, is no exception and makes simple, understandable and accessible what has been difficult for many for a long time.",

That wallet is actually part of a public/private key pairing. The public key is the wallet address and it us intrinsically linked to the private key. You cannot guess the private key by knowing the public key, i.e. it cannot be brute force hacked.\n\nTypically you BTC on a central exchange and then send it to a wallet app. Now when you spend BTC, you go to your wallet app and create a transaction. Before the money (crypto) can be spent, the wallet has to prove it has the authority to spend that BTC. It does so by signing the transaction which is done with an algorithm that uses the private key. The private key (or keys)  is what is stored on the wallet app, not the crypto or the record of the crypto you have. Once the transaction is signed it is sent out into the big wide world and verified back the blockchain validators before a record of the transaction is added to the blockchain.\n\nThe keys are produced as a pair using an algorithm. The algorithm typically starts the process using a number. The seed is a written representation of that number. It is easy to write words without mistakes than it is to write a very very long seed number. The seed phrase is converted to a numeric representation and used by the algorithm to create the blockchain address where your crypto record is stored (public key) and the key to prove you own it (private key).\n\nThe seed phrase can be taken by someone to their own phone or computer, entered into the wallet app using the seed recovery process and bingo they now have the authority to transfer your BTC to their own wallet. They do not need access to your hardware wallet, phone or computer.\n\n\nNever ever share your seed. If someone asks you for it they are a scammed. There is 0% chance someone asking for your seed is legit.",

            "text": "  We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.\n\n  \n**TLDR**:Ampleforth is fascinating because it has the potential to become the global base money of the future. This is done by having governance in code, and it internalises any currency volatility to produce countercylical pressures with its monetary policy.**Get smart:** This is unlike the current global currency (USD) that we have, so this model has a potential to succeed.**Get smarter:** The problem is arguably how the distribution of tokens are with certain key stakeholders. Could affect token holders in the long-run. \n\n# General Conclusion\n\nAmpleforth is very interesting because it could definitely become a global base currency moving forward. Instead of USD, imagine a currency that is used by everyone in the world to trade. Instead of having the world currency (USD) being tied to the internal politics of US, this new currency is neutral and changes its monetary supply based on the global demand of money.In this episode, we will uncover the design of Ampleforth works, the economic considerations and how it plays a role in the DeFi space.\n\n# 1. What is Ampleforth (AMPL)\n\n* Ampleforth wants to be a token with a stable value.\n* **How?** They do this with an automated governance using code, by internalising the price volatility in the secondary market.\n* **Explain more?** The code is 2 math functions. (1) It calculates the price difference between the \"ideal price\" USD$1 and the actual exchange rate now (e.g. US$1.15). Then it mints more tokens, so that the price goes back down to US$1. (2) It doesn't do this suddenly, token changes happen over a period of 10 days. We call this supply smoothing.\n* **So what's cool about it?** It can be used as collaterals in the DeFi projects. It's also not strictly pegged to a fiat currency (e.g. DAI with USD), so it makes it more independent and useful in the long run. Basically, Ampleforth is the new global currency without central bank.\n* **Can I earn money with AMPL?** It is possible. For example, doing arbitrage trading with price differences, because you know that prices will always go back to US$1.\n\n# 2. AMPL vs AAVE, COMP, USD\n\n* You can't compare AMPL with AAVE or COMP.  \n* because they have different token functions.\n* AMPL has a money function and AAVE or COMP has a utility function. It's like comparing USD with American Airlines miles system. It's similar, but not the same.\n* But you **can** compare AMPL with USD.  \n* because they both have money functions.\n* AMPL has an independent monetary policy while USD clearly does not.\n* USD is governed by the central bank (aka FED). It's a bunch of smart people in a room, deciding how much money should be available in the economy, the interest rates, the lending rates, etc.\n* AMPL is governed by code instead.\n* **Is that good or bad?** It really depends. It's good because economists are always looking for solutions to get an independent neutral money, used by everyone. We call this the Triffin Dilemma. However, because it is **only** governed by code, it's possible to affect the secondary market in a short period, if you have enough tokens to manipulate the code.\n\n# 3. Economics Design of Ampleforth\n\n* **Market Design** \n* To increase network effects and demand for AMPL, there are 2 systems in place  \n* increase the use of AMPL as collaterals for DeFi projects\n* use of Geyser program for people to stake their tokens\n* To reduce insane fluctuation in prices, a supply smoothing function is applied, so the change in token quantity is done over a period of 10 days.\n* To become more politically independent and to tap onto the benefits of a digital network, the information (prices, volatility, decision making) is done by oracles and machines.\n* **Mechanism Design** \n* Math is used to define the rules of the game, for the system to abide by\n* When prices change, it affects the amount of tokens available. This directly affects the number of tokens you have in your wallet.  \n* **Get smart:** this is where most people don't understand the system. They think that AMPL is a scam. Because tokens can be removed. See below (5. Valuation of Ampleforth) for further explanation.\n* Oracles are used to take in prices (via exchange rates of AMPL) and internalise that information.  \n* **How**? It changes the amount of of AMPL supply, in response to the prices.\n* If prices are too high: print more AMPL\n* If prices are too low: burn some AMPL\n* **Token Design** \n* Instead of [chartallist](https://youtu.be/1suLcHUHcDU) money like USD, AMPL is metallist money (aka commodity money, like gold). But we call it synthetic or digital metallist money.  \n* Machines (math mentioned in #3) define the monetary policy\n* Uses Countercyclical approach (see points above on when it prints or burns AMPL)\n* Reduce economic fluctuations (see mechanism design above, on internalising price differences and changing supply, so value of 1 AMPL is about US$1)\n* AMPL's value is allowed to fluctuate between \u00b15% of US$1\\*  \n* this US$1 is pegged to the economic definition of \"Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the 2019 dollar\"\n* Supply smooth is used so that we prevent supply side inflation (or shocks). So if there is an increase in tokens by 15%, the increase will happen over 10 days. Each day will increase by 1.5% instead.\n* It's also interesting because it has low correlation to Crypto-assets price fluctuations.  \n* **Get smart**: this is great for being part of the portfolio\n* Big VCs own a significant percentage of AMPL tokens that is vest  \n* **Get smart**: this can be dangerous when the vesting period is over and they dump it in the market\n\n# 4. Monetary Policy\n\nThere are 3 situations in the monetary policy:\n\n>Graphs and explanations are in the video.\n\n* expansionary  \n* Prices will remain the same in the long-run\n* But supply will increase\n* Market cap will increase in the long-run\n* contractionary  \n* Prices will remain the same in the long-run\n* But supply will decrease\n* Market cap will decrease in the long-run\n\nCombine all these 3 states together, so you can visualise what the general shape of the supply and price and market cap looks like.",

            "text": "We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.\n\n \n\n**TLDR**:\n\nUTXO is the accounting method for Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin is not physical, it makes it hard to verify how much money there is in your wallet. Instead, Bitcoin tracks all the \"receipts\" of you many Bitcoins you have spent and how much you have remaining.\n\n**Get smart:** It works.\n\n**Get smarter:** The next levelling-up with UTXO is to enable UTXO to interact with smart contracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ELI5: What is UTXO?\n\n>UTXO is a way of calculating how many tokens you have in your wallet (aka accounting method). There are many other ways.\n\nUTXO stands for Unspent Transaction Output. It is the remaining amount or changes you get from each transaction. Only unused outputs can be used as inputs to a transaction. When a transaction takes place, the input is deleted and the output created as a new UTXO which can then be consumed in future transactions.\n\n>Think of it as a receipt that shows the balance amount or change. Add them up, and that is the total amount available for spending.\n\n**ELI5 explanation**\n\nA book costs $19.50. You have a $20 note. You pay with $20 and you get back $0.50 and a receipt saying you get back $0.50 in change.\n\nBecause everything is digital, it's hard to verify if you really have that $0.50. Instead, we rely on this receipt to tell us how much you have. When you add all these receipts up and calculate the total change received, that is the total amount of balance money you have to spend.\n\n**High school explanation**\n\nSuppose you have a UTXO that determines that you have 10 coins and you want to buy something that costs 2 coins. You would make a transaction spending your entire UTXO balance by sending 2 coins to someone else and 8 coins back to yourself. Once this transaction is complete, a UTXO is created, for both the consumer and the receiver.\n\nIn general, UTXO specifies how much money the user has received, essentially determines how much the user can spend. The amount the user gets back will be added to their account balance. Therefore, it is more likely that each user will have more than one UTXO, and the sum of all unused coins in each UTXO will be the user's total account balance.\n\n## UTXO and Dollar Bills\n\nIn a deeper sense, each UTXO is like a single coin or note of cash. If you have $25 in cash, you must have more than one note because there is no such thing as a real twenty-five dollar note. When you have $25 in your wallet, you can have any combination of the number of notes \u2014 UTXO currently in your wallet: Twenty-five $1 notes; five $5 notes; two $10 notes and one $5 note; a $20 note and a $5 note, etc.\n\n>Many note combinations total $25. In each case, you have exactly $25, even though you have a different number of notes in each scenario.\n\nThe same is true of UTXO. Even though you see a unique balance in your wallet, you may have one or more UTXOs currently in your wallet. These UTXOs come in different sizes but when added up, the total equals the total balance in your wallet.\n\nFor example, when you buy an item with cash, you may not be able to provide the exact amount needed to pay for it. Let say you buy a cup of coffee for $3.5. You have $25 in your wallet, but chances are, you do not have exactly $3.5 to pay for coffee.\n\nInstead, you'll need to pay more than one (or a few) notes and then get some change in return. You can pay for coffee with four $1 notes, in which case you will receive a 50-cent change. Or you can pay for coffee with a $20 note, in which case you will receive a $10 note, a $5 note, a $1 note and two 25 cents coins.\n\n## UTXO and Bitcoin\n\nLet's now bring it to Bitcoin. Because it is the most famous cryptocurrency that uses UTXO.\n\nSuppose the wallet has a balance of 100 $BTC. Even though you only see a single balance, the amount includes several UTXOs. You can have 4 combinations of UTXOs\n\n1. 25 $BTC each\n2. 2 UTXOs worth 50 $BTC\n3. or a set of UTXOs worth 37, 18, 40 and 5 $BTC.\n\nWhen you buy a new car worth 35 $BTC but your wallet contains only UTXO equal to 15, 17, 28 and 40 BTC each. In this case, it is impossible to split UTXO, so there is no way to pay exactly 35 $BTC to buy a car.\n\nInstead, you have to spend 40 $BTC. With such a problem, the network suggests 2 new UTXOs: 35 $BTC and 5 $BTC. That means the car dealer gets 35 $BTC UTXO, while you get 5 $BTC UTXO as a conversion.\n\nYou can also spend 17, 28 Bitcoins UTXOs and receive 10 $BTC when you convert. A transaction can use any combination of UTXOs. There is no control over what kind.\n\nJust as you can split UTXOs into separate instances, you can also combine them in larger transactions, generating less on the network.\n\n## UTXO Advantages\n\n* **Immutable:** Because the UTXO is simply referenced and is completely consumed when spent, there is no chance for a transaction to be redone.\n* **Verification:** Transactions can be verified in parallel. Two transactions cannot affect the same UTXO. This is due to the stateless nature of UTXO transactions. The transaction does not refer to any input outside of the consumed UTXOs and the corresponding signature.\n* **Privacy:** Privacy protection is encouraged in the UTXO model. Users are encouraged to create a new address for every incoming transaction including a changed address. By using a new address at a time, it is difficult to conclusively link different coins to a single owner.\n\n## UTXO Disadvantages\n\n* **UI / UX is difficult**. Users tend to think about accounts when they conceptualise their money. The wallet provider must manage a set of potential addresses and calculate the corresponding balances. Doing so in a way that privacy protection might require running a node locally.\n* **Limited smart contract capabilities.** Each UTXO has spending criteria that indicate the conditions of spending. This may require a signature from many parties but has very little ability to reference external state like an oracle.\n\n## Difference between Fiat and UTXO\n\n### Transaction Fees\n\n>First, you will have to pay transaction fees to make the transaction on the blockchain. When you send a certain amount of money to another address, the new UTXO you receive will be the original UTXO amount minus both the amount you send and the transaction fees on the blockchain you pay.\n\nNew UTXO = (initial total number of UTXOs) - (total amount sent to another address) - (transaction fees)\n\n*Transaction fees vary from blockchain to blockchain and can even change on the same blockchain at different times.*\n\n### Flexibility\n\n>Second, a regular Fiat transaction is not the same as a UTXO because Fiat notes are fixed on denominations. In other words, Fiat is limited to the value the government chooses to print.\n\nIn the United States, the denominations of notes exist: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100. In countries where Euro is used, the denomination of the note is \u20ac5, \u20ac10, \u20ac20, \u20ac50, \u20ac100, \u20ac200 and \u20ac500. These denominations do not include coins, but what they mean here is: you cannot create a cash note with any amount you want (e.g. $3.5). The value of each note is predetermined.\n\nThis is not true of UTXO. In practice, this has several important benefits. That is, it offers a lot more flexibility than the Fiat. It can have $1 M Bitcoin in a single UTXO, instead of thousands of fiat notes in different denominations.",

Having no other choice, Marston sets out to bring three members of his former gang to justice. \n\nThe game is played from a [third-person perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-person_view), and is a multi-player game. The player may freely roam in its interactive [open world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world), a fictionalized version of the [Western United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States) and [Northern Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mexico), primarily by [horseback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism) and on foot, but also, trains and stage coaches.\n\nInvestment Case\n\n1) Metaverse is the top performer of 2021, and will likely continue to be the most sought after sector going forward\n\n2) NFTs are seeing frantic buying, as investors speculate on ownership of all digital assets\n\n3) Most \u201cplay to earn\u201d games are boring, so an action packed game in the style of \u201cred Dead Redemption\u201d will make the application more \u201csticky\u201d\n\n4) This is not a meme coin, but a real project. There are multiple streams of returns. There is the opportunity to earn from token appreciation, passive returns, deflationary supply, NFT sales, game currency, etc.\n\n5) Investors are sought, not traders, and this is represented in the structure of the token, including reflection, anti whale, etc.\n\n6) The game developers have vast experience in creating metaverse projects, including TCG world\n\n7) The project is run by Ulrich Krach, who has extensive experience in banking, investments and technology going back 25 years. He is also running another crypto project, Mad Mongoose MADD, which is bringing his top performing hedge fund to the crypto market\n\n8) This is an entry level opportunity (fair launch). As there are not yet outside investors, there is no sales pressure from potential sellers\n\nRoadmap\n\nA top game developer is already on board. This developer has extensive experience in unity 3d graphics creation, NFTs and metaverse creation, and is located in Bahrain. The game is set to premiere in Q1 of 2022, but quality will take precedence over timing. \n\nLiquidity will be locked in January 2022. \n\nPromotion is starting in December 2021, and will include paid ads, PR news releases, social media, telegram, etc. There have been extensive discussions with Lunar Strategy, one of the top digital marketing agencies in the crypto space.\n\nThe Project Head\n\nUlrich Krach is an experienced investment manager, having spent over 20 years at leading investment firms in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. He brings experience from such firms as Deutsche Bank (Germany), Credit Suisse (Switzerland), Legatum Capital (Dubai), Narmo Capital (Bahrain), Yuanta Securities (Taiwan), Primasia Securities (Taiwan), Fubon Financial (Taiwan), among others. Mr. Krach has a Bachelor of Commerce from McMaster University in Canada, and an MBA from York University in Canada. He is also the author of the book: Secrets of Successful Speculation (available on amazon.com)\n\nTokenomics\n\nWild Wild West Metaverse (WWW), has contract address (0x71a152c54945394cea597e95158a7ea5bbf2bc8b). It has 10 bn tokens outstanding, with an initial price of 0.001 USD, giving it a very reasonable market cap of 10m USD. It will be paired with BUSD to limit volatility. \u200b\n\n**Transaction tax**\n\nThe token has a transaction tax of 8% on each buy and sell, as following. This is intended to reward holders in favor of traders.\n\n1) Marketing 2%. This will ensure growth of the community as word spreads. It will include social media, PR news releases and paid ads. A top digital marketing agency is on board.\n\n2) Burning 2% (instant burn), meaning the token will be hyper deflationary, as every trade reduces the total supply, increasing the value of each remaining token. \n\n3) Reflecting 2% (paid in WWW coin), meaning that on every transaction, existing holders get rewarded in WWW token\n\n4) Liquidity 2% (go directly to LP)\u200b. This will be used to continually increase the size of the liquidity pool, providing stability to the price.\n\n**Anti Whale Measures are embedded in the token, with a** Max wallet 5% of float and Max transaction 3% of float. This again is designed to limit volatility and reward investors over traders.\n\nMetaverse/Gaming/\u201dPlay to Earn\u201d Industry\n\nThanks to Facebook\u2019s pivot to \u201cmeta\u201d, 2021 has seen the explosive rise of the metaverse, as both major and small companies look to carve out their niche in this space. \n\nMost of the top performers in crypto in 2021 have come in gaming/metaverse tokens. And analysts predict a continuation of this strong trend. This year, we saw Axie Infinity launched at 14 cents, and is currently trading at 91. Sandbox launched at 8 cents, and is now trading at 4.86. Decentraland launched at 0.01, and is now at 3.16. All these tokens now have a market cap of 4-7bn USD. \n\nWild Wild West launched at 0.001 in December 2021. There is huge potential for WWW to grow into something like Axie Infinity, considering its very small market cap of USD 10m and price of 0.001 USD. How high can it go? 10x? 100x?\n\n\u201cPlay to Earn\u201d\n\nThe Play-to-Earn business model is the latest development in the games industry. It\u2019s a business model that embraces the concept of an open economy and provides financial benefits to all players who add value by contributing to the game world. It\u2019s likely to introduce new game concepts and retention models not yet seen in modern gaming. \n\nThe online gaming community worldwide is witnessing a steady growth in members of all ages and from all over the world. With the gaming industry currently being worth more than $180 billion, this rise is only expected to continue. Recently, a new form of gaming called \"Play-to-Earn\" has emerged that has taken the community by storm.\n\nSimply put, Play-to-Earn games provide the opportunity for players to make money by playing games online and earning collectibles. This is made possible through blockchain technology \u2013 the same technology used to power [Bitcoin](https://www.manilatimes.net/topic?eid=127564&ename=Bitcoin&lang=en) \u2013 to keep track of users' progress. In Play-to-Earn games like the popular Axie [Infinity](https://www.manilatimes.net/topic?eid=82989&ename=Infinity&lang=en), players can earn in-game items that are represented by Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain. \n\nSummary\n\nWild Wild West is a new gaming token launched on the Binance Smart Chain. Our goal is to create an old wild west world with NFT functionality. The WWW token will represent ownership of the company and currency within the game.\n\nWWW is also a deflationary token that rewards its holders:\n\n\u00b7 2% reflection\n\n\u00b7 2% liquidity pool\n\n\u00b7 2% instant burn\n\n\u00b7 2% marketing\n\n\u00b7 10 bn token supply\n\n\u00b7 WWW exclusive NFTs out soon\n\n\u00b7 Game development to finish in Q1 2022\n\n\u00b7 Liquidity will be locked in January 2022\n\n\u00b7 Verified contract on BSC Scan\n\n\u00b7 Huge marketing campaign\n\n\u00b7 Less than 10 holders at the moment\n\n\u00b7 Coinmarketcap and Coingecko listing soon\n\nMore information under: [www.wildwildwestmetaverse.com](http://www.wildwildwestmetaverse.com/)",

            "text": "Many World's ($MANY) - World's First Marginal Tax Crypto System\n\n \n\nListen up gang, we got a real moonshot here so load your bags before liftoff. How do I know? I'm one of the Devs.\n\nWhat a journey it has been, but the time has finally come and we have launched the pinksale. This is not just a moonshot, it's a moonshot with justification. So let's start right there, myself and the CEO are completely doxxed:\n\nCEO - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanvir-shagar-np-7a3b5713b)\n\nCOO - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenjbumbera)[Audit](https://solidity.finance/audits/ManyWorlds/)\n\n[Website](https://www.manyworldstoken.com/)\n\n[Whitepaper](https://docs.manyworldstoken.com/whitepaper/usdmany-worlds-token/tokenomics)\n\n[BSCscan](https://bscscan.com/address/0x3E2ed75F718251Fd011312b9E33Bf10A4dbfda54)\n\n[Art Teaser](https://share.getcloudapp.com/P8u602zR)\n\n[Pinksale](https://www.pinksale.finance/#/launchpad/0x40aA8469b2AEFD263d2604DB38C5474b3BC7d3A3?chain=BSC)\n\nWhat's amazing about what we have done so far, is this team formed only about a month ago and have since delivered this quality of work in a very short period of time. But let's get talking about the token:\n\nManyWorld's is essentially broken up into 3 areas: Visionary tokenomics, Utility, and Entertainment\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nWe have created the worlds first marginal tax system in the crypto space :) This means that the tokens you hold behave differently depending on when you purchased them in terms of taxes paid and rewards received. Our token pays you weekly BUSD rewards for holding depending on the length that you hold!\n\nCurrent BUSD rewards based systems levy a heavy tax on both the buy and sell side, most in the range of 13-14%. They then distribute those rewards on an hourly basis (huge gas fees) evenly among all token holders depending on how many you are holding. The reason they are all the same is because EverGrow ($EGC) was the creator of BUSD rewards contracts and ever contract since has been a copy and paste of it.\n\nProblem: This system only caters to the early whales by creating a 50% burn at launch and having a tax so heavy that as the price of the underlying asset increases, the taxes simply are not worth paying for later investors in terms of BUSD rewards. Volume is the only way to generate BUSD rewards and a 13% buy tax and 13% sell tax makes this impossible to trade since you would need 30% returns simply to break even. The only real reason to purchase a token like this is the BUSD rewards, but again the same problem arises that between the heavy taxes and the immediate 50% burn, the BUSD rewards generated for later investors won't even be enough to cover the taxes.\n\nSolution: 50% burn on a quarterly schedule and the world's first marginal tax system.\n\n**Buy Tax**\n\nThe buy tax is 3% as compared to 13-14%, immediately resolving the barrier to entry problem. But if our buy tax is so much lower than how can we possibly issue BUSD rewards at a better rate? That answer is in the marginal sell tax system.\n\n**Sell Tax**\n\nAt the time of purchase, whatever tokens were purchased begin aging. Yes, this means if you purchased some tokens today and then purchased some tokens next week, each group of tokens that you own is now aging at a different rate and therefore earning different rewards:\n\nLevel Rewards:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Level|Milestone Age|Feature Unlocked|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|1st Day|Lottery|\n|2|8th Day|BUSD Rewards Kit|\n|3|91st Day|BUSD Upgrade Kit|\n|4|180th Day|Redacted|\n|5|Redacted Day|Redacted|\n\nTaxes:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Level 1 Sales Tax|Level 2 Sales Tax|Level 3 Sales Tax|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|3%|8%|12%|\n\nAs your tokens age, you earn more and more rewards and the sell tax increases up to the cap of the L3 sales tax.\n\n# Rewards\n\n**Level 1 Lottery**: At level 1, meaning starting from the moment you purchase, you are able to participate in the daily lottery. Every token purchased within a 24 hour period counts towards entries into the daily lottery. At the end of each 24 hour period, 10 wallets who have entered that day are randomly selected and the winnings are distributed evenly among those 10 winners. Not only is this just cool, it greatly helps with the volume problems of other BUSD rewards contracts.\n\nBetween the lottery, low buy tax, and low level 1 sell tax, this is the only stablecoin rewards based system in existence that makes it possible for day traders/swing traders to participate in.\n\n**Level 2 BUSD Rewards Kit:** At Level 2, tokens start earning rewards from the L2 rewards wallet paid out on a weekly basis. Every Monday, rewards are distributed from this wallet to all Level 2 tokens in circulation.\n\n**Level 3 BUSD Rewards Upgrade Kit:** At Level 3, tokens start earning rewards from the L3 wallet in addition to the L2 wallet. So all Level 3 tokens in circulation will receive their BUSD rewards from both the L2 and L3 wallet.\n\n**Beyond Level 3:** Our taxes cap at Level 3 but we are still tracking the age of tokens beyond that. This gives us the ability to pay out even more rewards from other parts of the ecosystem which you can read about in the whitepaper.\n\n# Utility\n\nThe idea behind Many World's is to not create some massive system and be in competition with the titans of the industry, but instead to create bridge utility between client/ecosystem, ecosystem/ecosystem, and metaverse/metaverse. The first stage of that process is going to happen within our own ecosystem and connections will happen with partners and internal projects as we continue to build out the software. You can read more about the utility [here](https://docs.manyworldstoken.com/whitepaper/usdmany-worlds-platform/vision).\n\n# Entertainment\n\nOne of the Devs is an executive in an entertainment design and development company that creates innovative content for film, television, streaming platforms, home video, and themed entertainment attractions on a global scale and has developed animated TV series\u2019 that are on Disney+ and animated media for IP-based themed attractions.\n\nThrough this strategic partnership, we will have the capacity to take on new ecosystems with an entertainment focus and we will expand our stories from NFT Comics that will be traded at our NFT Trading Post to Metaverse PTE Games, NFT Avatars, Mobile Games, Animated Feature Films, Animated TV Series, Tabletop Games, Trading Cards, and so on.\n\nThe art that was teased above is to show what our first NFT Comic Books will look like before we move into the other industries noted above.\n\n# Summary\n\nThis is 1000x opportunity but not just from the need to hype it up. With our visionary tokenomics, well-connected and transparent dev team, utility use-cases, strategic partners, and awesome ecosystem, this is a crypto moon shot that won't just touch the moon and come plummeting back to Earth, but it can reach the moon, build a base, and then head further across the cosmos. If you're eager to get started please review the links posted at the top but if at this point your screaming \"take my money\", join the discord for an opportunity to be part of the whitelist.\n\n**THE DEADLINE TO PLEDGE IS DEC 20TH AT 4PM, PLEASE JOIN THE DISCORD FOR THE PLEDGE FORM.**\n\n**TL;DR:** Doxxed leaders, audited by Solidity, worlds first marginal crypto tax system, stablecoin rewards, daily lottery, amazing art, big ambitious plans, and we are just starting the pinksale this weekend. With the ability to have multiple tax lots that are also rewarded differently, we created a healthy trading environment for traders of all classes and sizes and a scalable environment that doesn't have a barrier to entry only rewarding the early whales. There are so many more goodies that I'm not going to put in here because I know your attention spans are a 7.",

            "text": "\u201cYou will all be familiar with the fact that Google rebranded as Alphabet and Facebook as Meta Group, this is because Google had become more than just a search engine and facebook more than just a social media site. Smartlands was initially created to tokenize land based assets such as farmland and real estate but since our founding we have noted multiple opportunities in other areas such as NFTs, SMEs, data centers, agirultural produce and so on. We felt the name Smartlands did not fully reflect all the business verticals we have developed. From the token holder perspective however SLT will always be the currency of our ecosystem across all business verticals and 33% of all fees generated will be returned to qualifying SLT holders who enter our \"soft\" staking program\u201d\n\n\u201cSLT is a utility token, that fuels all the activities in our platform. Especially all the participants of Definder/Smartlands ecosystem have to collect all the fees and SLT, and the portion (33%) of the collected fees goes as a staking rewards (without increasing SLT supply)\u201d\n\n\n**Definder** - is a new name of our ecosystem and holding company.\n\n\n**SLT** \u2013 is our utility token, issued in 2017 on the Stellar Network.\n\n\n**Smartlands** \u2013 is our brand for real estate and agriculture vertical.\n\n\n\u201cWe decided to rebrand, to more focus on the long term vision (DeFi for real economy assets, more directions for investments, etc.)\u201d\n\n\u201cOur main competitive advantage is a unique positioning, as not only tech/smart contracts/infrastructure provider, but as a complete alternative investment platform, a one-stop-shop solution both for the asset owners and all kinds of investors (retail, HNWIs, family offices).\u201d\n\n\u201cThe main difference with Smartlands is that we are creating a complete infrastructure that is fully legally compliant with the laws of the country in which it operates. For example in Liechtenstein we have created a subsidiary, hired the best law firms and made sure that we have become part of the legal and business environment. This process has required a large (6 figure) investment in Swiss Francs but has the effect of allowing us to operate as part of recognized legal structure in a country that is globally well respected for its financial stewardship. I suspect earlier projects just focused on the crypto aspect of their business and did not overcome all the legal requirements to support their peration.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were also the first to carry out a real estate tokenization project on the Stelar blockchain. We are now in the process of rolling this out globally \u2013 our ultimate target is to tokenize $1 trillion of assets globally.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re closely working with multiple contractors, including top lawyers in Liechtenstein and Ukraine, IT and blockchain specialists, marketing, etc. In total, more than 30 people.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo become a qualified holder the holder simply needs to \u201csoft\u201d stake their SLT holding through the Definder / Smartlands wallet. Minimum requirement is Euro 1,000 of SLT to qualify, the exchange rate is fixed at the start of the month and applies to the remainder of that month. All qualifying token holders are then due to share in the fee pool distribution which represents 33% of the fees generated in that month. This is shared on a pro-rata basis among the qualifying holders based upon the number of tokens staked and the number of days staked in that month. I might add this is \u201csoft\u201d staking and holders can unstake their SLT at any time. This also of course helps to further reduce the amount of SLT in general circulation\u00a0 which, if one understand the concept of elasticity of supply and demand can only be good for the direction of the SLT price over time.\u201d [Source](https://esatoshi.club/smartlands-recap/)\n\n[Smartlands platform/wallet](https://Smartlands.app)\n\n[Smartlands Staking Guide](https://medium.com/smartlands/slt-wallet-update-staking-and-usdc-xlm-pair-added-a2492d9133ea)\n\n[**October News and Progress**](https://definder.global/newsletters/smartlands-monthly-roundup-october-newsletter/)\n\n[**November News and Progress**](https://definder.global/newsletters/smartlands-monthly-roundup-november-newsletter-2/)\n\n[**All news and progress**](https://definder.global/news/)",

            "text": "As everyone has noticed, the last few weeks we have seen a pretty volatile market. Are we in a bull market or in a bear market? No one knows and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we will keep staying in this uncertainty for a few more weeks.\n\nOne thing that is important in a market like this is having control over your investments. Although I wasn\u2019t there in the previous cycle, from what I have heard there are a lot more projects that are clear scams, quick pump and dumps and projects without any use case (I'm sure most of you have seen some examples yourself of this in this sub). Investing in these projects is risky, but having the right tools, can and will be a life safer (or better said; investment safer).\n\nA platform that could help you with this is Bogged.finance. BOG offers several important tools that are usually only available on CEXs (like Binance, Coinbase, Crypto.com etc). Here I would like to outline why I think Bogged is not only a great platform with great tools, but why I believe it\u2019s also a great investment (and why they think the same in [this article](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-hidden-gem-cryptos-to-buy-before-they-break-out)).\n\n**First, let\u2019s take a look at the tokenomics:**\n\n* *Total supply:* 15 million\n* *Circulation supply:* 14.15 million (so almost 1 million tokens burned already!)\n* *Marketcap:* roughly $16 million\n* *Tax:* 4%, of which:  \n\\-1% burned every transaction  \n\\-3% goes to stakers (current APR for solo staking is around 11%!)\n\nThis bull run, some of the most interesting projects were launched on BSC (Binance Smart Chain) as the fees are very low, especially compared to Ethereum. Currently BOG is only tradeable on BSC, but once Certik finishes an audit of the smart contract ([you can track the progress here](https://www.certik.com/projects/boggedfinance)), it will also be tradable between several other chains/networks, including: Polygon, Avalanche, Cronos (crypto.com) and Fantom.\n\nYou might be wondering; what happens to the BOG supply if all tokens are already in circulation? The answer to that is simple; it will be distributed over all the different chains, highly reducing the circulation supply per chain! (which, in theory, means the price could go up, by a lot).\n\nSo which trading tools from Bogged.finance can help you with trading?\n\n* **Limit orders:** Limit Orders are, in essence, instructions to BUY or SELL an asset at a specific price, within a specific timeframe. Want to buy this new token for $xxx ? Set a limit order and once the token reaches this price, the order will be filled.\n* **Stop losses:** no more sleepless nights! A typical stop-loss works by a trader setting a sell price at X% of their purchase price, to hedge against loss. Then, the trading platform executes automatically when the price sinks, hitting the trader\u2019s chosen %.\n* **Swaps:** see below for more info about BogSwap\n* **Sniper:** this is a tool that allows you to buy a newly launched token before others are able to. A very powerful tool in the right hands\u2026\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at the main tools of Bogged:\n\n* BogSwap\n* BogCharts\n* BogBridge\n* BogFolio (soon)\n\n**BogSwap:** [**https://app.bogged.finance/**](https://app.bogged.finance/)\n\nBogSwap uses algorithmic routing technology to ensure that your trade goes through at the best possible price. BogSwap always finds the cheapest route between various DEXes and uses that for your swap. As an example; for BSC tokens, BOG will get you the best price from 12 different DEXs\u2026\n\nOther great features of BogSwap are that it allows you to pre-set your gas amount, saving time spent messing around in your wallet app and also clarifying the process of spending gas on a swap. **AutoTax**, let BogSwap handle the tax automatically with AutoTax and **Multi Tx; s**ubmit more than one transaction when making a swap. Useful for certain trading strategies and avoiding TX limits.\n\n*Available on: BSC, Polygon, Cronos and within the next few days Fantom and Avalanche.*\n\n**BogCharts:** [**https://charts.bogged.finance/**](https://charts.bogged.finance/)\n\nBogCharts is the most feature complete tracking and charting tool for the Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Cronos, Fantom and Avalanche, helping you to make the best investing decisions.\n\n**BogBridge**\n\nWhat do you do if you hold BNB and want to buy a token that is available on Polygon, and you don\u2019t want to use a CEX? Bogged to the rescue! Now that the Certik audit is almost complete, I expect that within the new few weeks BogBridge will be available and you can swap tokens between different chains. How many other projects out there offer this?!\n\n**BogFolio**\n\nHopefully within a few months the team will release their app called BogFolio. It\u2019s an app for portfolio tracking, price notifications, among others. Think Coingecko app. Very cool if they are able to pull this off (and so far the team has always delivered).\n\nAs you can tell there are many reasons why I believe Bogged.finance is a great project. The team keeps coming with great new features, improvements and expansions and with its small market cap this could truly be a moonshot.\n\n**Tl;dr**  \nBogged.finance offers a ton of trading tools which can help you become more successful as a cryptotrader. In addition, they offer one of the best charts out there and now that the smart contract audit is complete, we should hopefully be able to do cross chain swaps across several chains soon. It only has a market cap of around $16 million, and with the upcoming upgrades, partnerships and new tools, I truly believe this is a project everyone should take a look at. ([and so does Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-hidden-gem-cryptos-to-buy-before-they-break-out))\n\nWhat do you use for trading smaller cap coins that are not listed on CEX's yet?",

            "text": "I clearly enjoy cryptocurrency, but even more, I have a never ending desire to understand it. People always talk about how crypto is \"volatile\" and big swings are just apart of the game. While I agree with that idea, I also find it hard to think of an asset that is more easily, commonly, and legally manipulated more than crypto. In the example below, I will be focusing specifically on BTC.\n\nI was reading some deep analysis last night on the increasingly popular **Direct trades (person-to-person)(peer-to-peer) P2P,** online sales of bitcoin on a whale level. But, what has been growing in popularity is the manipulative, more profitable way whales have been selling/changing hands of bitcoin this cycle. And don't forget, the one of the goals of P2P whale transactions are to not crash the market, whether it's a crash up or down, as in real, big, 60% plus crashes. And the reason I bring that up is because you have to understand market-cap, liquidity, and how the stereotypical understanding of market-cap for crypto is completely misunderstood. \n\n***There*** are many situations where **whale A** wants to sell their BTC. But, instead of just dumping on the open market they make a private agreement with a **Whale B** who wants to buy BTC (P2P). For this more profitable & risky P2P example, they can find these whale buyers from discreet (in the know) middle men who take a commission, or if these whales are just (in the know) themselves. But having a trusted middleman makes the change of hands typically work far easier. \n\nInstead of just sending/selling/buying from wallet to wallet, these P2P transaction events happen by Whale A announces he\u2019s gonna dump BTC on the spot market and the (buyer) Whale B then opens a leveraged short on the market right before whale A dumps. Once whale A has dumped all his bag (big volume) BTC spot price will generally dump with it the majority of the time. As soon as the bag is fully dumped on the open market whale B closes their short. And as soon as whale B short is closed, whale A bag is dumped, and BTC price has violently dipped. Whale A then opens a new leveraged long. \n\nOnce new long is opened, whale B then immediately starts buying up the amount of BTC (worth in usd) prior to the dump. Whale B is now technically buying \"discounted\" BTC because the spot price is lower, but he's still spending the same amount of USD he would have if he had just bought via traditional P2P wallet transaction. Thus, whale B is actually now accumulating X amount of \"extra\" BTC for the same initial agreed upon price. Plus, whale B also profited big on the planned open short that whale B had just closed. \n\nOnce whale B buy's up the agreed upon amount in USD worth of BTC the spot market generally goes back to being stable, or whatever price BTC was at, at the start of the whole deal. When whale B finishes his buying, Whale A then closes his leveraged long that was opened during the dip caused by both parties. At this point both whale A and B have successfully changed hands, technically been paid, and are both far happier with the transaction financially because they received a much better bang for their buck deal than they would have if they just send the BTC via traditional P2P. \n\nIn a successful event like this, both parties report the total amount of \"profit\" they made from the change of hands, they report it to the middleman and/or to each other. This step is usually completely transparent & honest. Thus responsible for the increasingly popular way to sell & buy bitcoin when you are working with enough to move the market. In the case of the middleman, he will keep the whole thing private, both parties happy, take his cut, done. \n\nThis specific example was seen yesterday, and looked to be almost perfectly executed. Starting at 50324 whale A dumped. Price dipped to 48446, then bounced back to 50378. \n\nThings to add:\n\nMost of the time, at least during a bull market. The most common side effect will be the rebound bounce up goes higher than the spot price when the change of hands starts because retail traders open more longs than shorts, and typically open them towards the end of the bounce up or at the top.\n\nThis increasingly popular way to buy sell crypto as a whale can be regularly seen once you are aware of these behaviors. Some of these quick dip change of hands move the market a little, sometimes a lot. But the majority of the sharp volatility ends when the change of hands is over and likely when BTC returns to just about the same price at the beginning.  \n\nSometimes multiple parties are involved. Multiple shorts, multiple longs, extra players etc.. \n\nThere are times when one of the parties don't hold their end of the stick...\n\nThese transactions should take 20 minutes - 12 hours MAX. Anything longer is most likely regular market behavior.  \n\n**Why is this important?**\n\nI have no idea, If anyone has something to add to this, please do. I have always had passing thoughts and market movements identifying manipulation, but never heard of a real, start to end proven example strategy until this one. I personally think it's lowkey awesome and if you place yourself in the position that the top 15k BTC wallets, Would you not do the same thing?",

It runs on Polygon (Matic) network. Advantage of polygon network is transfers are very cheap so anyone can try it without paying  fees like ethereum and bitcoin. Token is listed on [https://app.sushi.com/](https://app.sushi.com/) and [https://quickswap.exchange/](https://quickswap.exchange/) . My vision is to become principal medium of exchange throughout the Milky Way galaxy a possibly beyond once the humanity will be able to live in other planets/galaxies.\n\nThis project is in very early stages and is not investment or mooning project. It is about learning about crypto and test the technology. So do not put money into it - im looking for enthusiastic people who would allow organic growth with added liquidity in range of cents. Im not really sure how this exactly work so any help would be appreciated. I want to distribute coints amongs as many people on the earth and then burn rest 99,99% to be truly decentralized.  Total supply is 4,200,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 and no more can be created. After distribution - majority will be lost and no one will own more that 1%. Altairian dollar on polygonscan: [https://polygonscan.com/token/0xc36c817e58233dd9771a56a4b97499d1b7f84c9d](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xc36c817e58233dd9771a56a4b97499d1b7f84c9d)\n\nTo find and add Altairian dollar ALTD token on exchange contract adress is: 0xc36c817e58233dd9771a56a4b97499d1b7f84c9d\n\n1. You need metamask or other decentralized walled : [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn)\n2. Add Polygon network to your metamask wallet: Go to Setting -> Networks -> Add networkd and fill this\n\n\\- Network Name: Polygon\n\n\\- New RPC URL: [https://polygon-rpc.com](https://polygon-rpc.com) or\n\n\\- ChainID: 137\n\nHow to do it with pictures: [https://medium.com/stakingbits/setting-up-metamask-for-polygon-matic-network-838058f6d844](https://medium.com/stakingbits/setting-up-metamask-for-polygon-matic-network-838058f6d844)\n\nNow you are able to send MATIC coin (which is main coin used on POLYGON NETWORK for transaction fees) from Binance or other exchanges to your new metamask polygon network wallet. Be sure you are using polygon (matic) network for transactions - not ethereum or bnb!\n\n3. Now to add ALTD token to your metamask wallet. Open your metamask, scroll down and press import tokens. Then fill the Token Contract Address which is 0xc36c817e58233dd9771a56a4b97499d1b7f84c9d. It will automaticly load the ticker symbol. Press import custom token and now you see it in your wallet. EASY.\n\n4. Once you have some matic on your wallet you can buy pair MATIC/ALTD on sushiswap or uniswap. There is low liquidity right now so Im looking for more ppl who will add MATIC/ ALTD luquidity into the pool.  Liquidity providers earn a 0.25% fee on all trades proportional to their share of the pool. Fees are added to the pool, accrue in real time and can be claimed by withdrawing your liquidity. For first participants I can send you 42 000 ALTD tokens if you will be able to add liquidity for possible exchange. Send me your polygon network adress and I will distrubute the coins.\n\nHere is what guide says about ALTD:   \u201c The Altairian dollar is the principal medium of exchange throughout the Milky Way galaxy, partly due to the general incompatibility (and/or illusory nature) of most other forms of currency. According to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a competent hitchhiker should be able to see the galaxy on less than thirty Altairian dollars a day, although costs around the Guide's headquarters make this, ironically, almost impossible. \u201c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ayg2jey725281.jpg?width=317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b20f3104bfb20847a2c31ddf7c1ab88be4166157",

One of them is: \u201chow patient should I be?\u201d, and the other is \u201cshould I sell at the market dip, even if at loss?\u201d. Patience is an issue when it comes to crypto trading, especially if you know that the project you\u2019re investing in is undervalued, you\u2019d literally be checking the price one a constant basis.\n\nWe all witness when the market is dipping or bearing two types of investors. The first type who freaks out and starts selling so they would protect themselves. But why would you freak out, if you as assumed trust the coin you\u2019re investing in? The second type would just go all in and buy the dip.\n\nSpeaking for myself I have a big wallet of different tokens. For sure I\u2019m not HODLing all of them. I do day-to-day trading, that\u2019s something normal, but I always search for potential projects that I can trust. I always take MATIC as an ideal example. This project always proves to be there for the community improving and shaping the ecosystem and aiming for the ultimate decentralization. I guess you can know what type of investors I encourage.\n\nI compare HODLling to going camping lmfao. This long journey with the bumpy roads and obstacles.

            "text": "[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moontrust/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moontrust/)\n\nMoonTrust recently released their app, which is basically a crypto token payments platform with friends list, private chat, and group chat features like Telegram/Discord.\n\nyoutube video: [https://youtu.be/Od5naDvMNZE](https://youtu.be/Od5naDvMNZE)\n\n**What is MoonTrust?**\n\nJust this year alone, tens of thousands of tokens were created. Most of these token communities were built through Telegram and Discord. Often when new potential investors join these communities, they are misled by the information within the chat channels. This is done by employing bots to hype the project and create traction. Some also employ real humans as moderators who do not even own the token. MoonTrust is a platform to enhance the community by making sure everyone is fully transparent with each other.\n\n**MoonTrust Group Chat Feature**\n\nIn MoonTrust only token holders are allowed to chat, and it will show the actual holding amount at the time of the message. Users are also able to create custom chat channels with customizable token holding requirements. This will help community managers manage their \u201cdolphin\u201d and \u201cwhale\u201d holders. MoonTrust system will automatically remove holders who no longer meet the token requirements.\n\n**MoonTrust Payments and Friends**\n\nMoonTrust also supports payments between friends. When transferring tokens between friends, you no longer need to remember their public address. Simply find your friend using their unique username and send or request as you would just like Venmo. Final confirmation is done via your software wallet. MoonTrust also supports private messaging between friends. Users can also find common tokens held between each other. This allows users to find new friends who have similar token interests.\n\n**MoonTrust Privacy**\n\nAlthough MoonTrust offers multiple privacy options for its users, they do not have privacy options for group chat transparency. Group chats are meant to be public and to prevent manipulation. Anyone who chats in group chats will have their token holding value displayed (only for that specific group chat).\n\n**How Can MoonTrust Benefit Token** **Holders?**\n\nMoonTrust group chat system is a heavily needed system in a space where there are tons of rug pulls making headlines every week. Scammers like to airdrop phishing/scam tokens to random address, but with MoonTrust, the community can warn each other in the specific token group chats. Projects that create fake hype by employing influencers, shillers, or bots, will also be exposed with this chat system. Currently, it is also common that communities are managed by mods who do not own tokens in various Telegram and Discord project groups. These mod services are typically paid in stablecoins, ETH, BNB or BTC, but never the specific project token. In MoonTrust, these types of situations will not happen as holders' token value is displayed and only holders can moderate each other. Any bots or scam offenders banned in MoonTrust will have a direct cost of business to scam groups via gas fees of specific blockchains. Currently banning scammers or bots in Telegram or Discord is free. Malicious actors can easily create thousands of accounts. However, in MoonTrust users can only enter a chat group if they have the tokens. This means for every new account, malicious groups need to send tokens to that address, thus costing them money. MoonTrust is dubbing this \u201cProof of Gas\u201d mechanism. Just imagine the cost of business for these scam groups when using MoonTrust for the ETH chain.\n\n**Upcoming Features**\n\nThe MoonTrust team is not stopping with their current iteration of the app. They are also working on a governance and moderation mechanism. The goal is to allow token holders to ban/mute each other based on their stake in the project. For example, a whale can ban a small fish, but if enough fish and dolphins team up, they can also remove whales. Although the MoonTrust App works on mobile devices, the MoonTrust team is also working on iOS and Android apps to improve user interfaces and user experience. They are working on new designs to better suit the viewing and usage experience of mobile devices.\n\n**Upcoming Multiple Blockchain Support**\n\nThe MoonTrust project is aiming to launch its platform across all blockchains that have token projects built in them. The MoonTrust team is targeting one blockchain launch per year. Their platform launch for Cardano, Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and Avalanche are currently in the works.\n\nApp:[ https://moontrust.net/](https://moontrust.net/)\n\nInformational Website:[ https://moontrust.info/](https://moontrust.info/)",

            "text": "Ok so i'm down to talk about any coins y'all want, but i'm going to focus on BTC & ETH for this **DD**.\n\nBTC's current strongest line of *support* is about **60300**. This line was not broken. If broken, *new* strongest line of *support* is **53k**.\n\nEth's current strongest line line of *support* is about **4300**. This WAS broken. New strongest line of *support* is **3970**.\n\nToday we have now had four big red candles on the hourly & of those four, TWO were LARGE for the relative recent past. And in my experience I have only ever seen 2-3 LARGE red candles (**whale market orders**) during a dip before we usually continue sideways, continue up, or run up before continuing going back down.\n\nThis is my current prediction\u2026 but this is actually super **bullish**. This dip was crucial to continue the run, on crypto quant we are in the **beginning** **stages** of ETH genesis wallets starting to sell rather than accumulate. So to put that into perspective to last year, genesis wallets started to sell at 17k-23k then stopped after the peak dip 5 months later from 64k-51k, then started to accumulate all summer again. The eth genesis wallets are important because most of these wallets are owned by veterans in the crypto space who saw the importance of ETH before anyone else and now there bags are huge with the biggest positions in most all mainstream cryptos. So **tracking** these wallets is the smartest way follow the general market.\n\nMy own bull case for crypto or (BTC) going to 100k+ by EOY was and has been *unrealistic* imo. But now, after this dip and finally starting to see genesis wallets sell. If we continue up, as i think we will, this next part of the run is usually followed by very steep upwards price movements **directly after the first wave of genesis wallets** start taking profits.\n\nThus, overall, as a quick DD, if we stay above the current strongest support line of 60300 for BTC and not break 4000 for ETH, then I will be FAR more bullish on this run than I was 3 weeks ago. And if this does play out, then the **parabolic** part of the bull-run is confirmed imo. PLUS Biden signed the new 1 trillion dollar **infrastructure** bill today... very bullish.\n\nThe only thing I see bringing us further down from these new recent lows are either unexpected global/national news, new negative global/national stock market FUD, or complete FUD targeting strictly crypto , but most **realistically** I think it will be from the fed announcing an **acceleration** in the f**ed taper plan**. Of which I don't see happening till March 2022.\n\n**Current positions**: Long on everything (no bearish positions currently) (have only taken profit on 10-15% of my bag over the past 10 weeks.\n\n**Current Trade Positions**: Limit long on **BTC** at 60375 (no-hit), Limit long on **ETH** at 4344 (Hit)(Active), Limit long on **EOS** at 4.5 (Hit)(Active), Limit long on **Atom** at 29.2 (Hit)(Active), Limit long on **LTC** at 225 (no-hit), Limit long on **AVAX** at 80 (no-hit), Limit long on **DOT** at 39 (no-hit), Limit long on **Matic** at 1.5 (no-hit), Limit long on WOO at 1.49 (no-hit). There are others that I see as good trading positions - relative to coin price but, I don't have any limit orders on them. And my current swing trade positions (no leverage) that I think are good value are 1inch, sushi, SKL, MIR, and Link.\n\nEdit: ALL my Limit longs hit and i\u2019m riding them on 8-14x leverage each hahah",

But I track genesis wallets because they arguably move together.\n\nA whale could be anybody, maybe Kayne West buying/selling bitcoin. But a genesis wallet activity is still a whale, but that wallet has also been involved in crypto for at least 7+ years and knows the game. When tracking the data, you have to think like a whale.\n\nYou are right to assume \"genesis wallet sell = market go down\" but in reality if all the genesis wallets sold at the same time, the market price might even go to zero... Its about liquidity. Whales own A LOT of the market. And similar to warren buffet, Whales can take weeks-months-even years in some cases to enter/exit their positions.\n\n\"genesis buy = market go up\" you are right to assume that too. But it wasn't until a few weeks after Elon announced TSLA would stop accepting BTC and the market was sub 40K until genesis wallets started to accumulate again. And by then, bitcoin was already down 45%+ retail traders all selling, dumb whales selling etc... all the while genesis wallets accumulate.\n\nAs for the selling being bullish. Since genesis wallets just started selling, one could say these are the wallets of people who were impatient for higher prices or maybe even just have an enormous bag.\n\nRemember, Whales control the markets, they always will. But Historically and perfectly genesis wallets have ALWAYS sold into the uptrend and Bought into the downtrend. Their activity usually takes place over the course of 3-7 months at a time. and Since genesis wallets JUST started selling, then we could assume there are still 4+ months of \"smart whales\" who hold a significant amount of the liquidity, are also waiting to sell, but will only sell at X price higher than what it is now. AND IF the rare case that this dip IS the crypto winter, then you won't see genesis wallets selling anymore. They are smart, this is not their first rodeo, they are rich asf and don't need to sell into a loosing market, their average cost basis is probably sub $300 or for ETH and Sub 7k for bitcoin. and thats just the average, many have cost basis's in the cents & dollars. Thus, they have no fear when the market goes bearish. they will just continue to hodl and even accumulate more until whenever they feel like selling. Which is almost always near ATH's and INTO a bullish market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry, were you able to get all that? hope it makes sense.",

This means that DApps on Ethereum can be forked or extended to the NEAR Ecosystem easily.\nHow does Aurora work?\nThe Aurora environment consists of:\n- The Aurora Engine, a high performance EVM\u2014Ethereum Virtual Machine\n- The Aurora Bridge, facilitating trustless transfer of ETH and ERC20 tokens between Ethereum and Aurora, within a great user experience.\nThe base fee token of Aurora is ETH, which will make developers and users feel like home. Aurora will not charge any fees for bridge transfers. Users only pay the ETH miners fee which is paid once during a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe wallet address on Aurora will be the same as the Ethereum address. Users will need to add Aurora as an additional network on Metamask and the Bridge will help users with that.\nTrisolaris is the first AMM built on Aurora. The AMM allows users to swap tokens, provide liquidity for tokens and earn fees for providing liquidity.\nThe governance of Aurora will take a hybrid form of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization\u2014the AuroraDAO\u2014complimented by a traditional entity which will hold one of several seats in the AuroraDAO.\nAURORA token\n     Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 AURORA\n     Allocation:\nEarly Aurora contributors  2.0%\nPrivate round investors  9.0%\nAurora Labs long term incentives  16%\nBootstrapping the Aurora ecosystem  1.0%\nIncentives for project advisors  1.0%\nDistributed to NEAR ecosystem  3.0%\nCommunity Treasury  20%\nDAO balance for future projects  48%\n\nAurora IDO\nAuroraDAO have voted to approve the process of $AURORA IDO. The sale will happen in three phases with the increasing amount of $AURORA tokens available for sale. The three chosen platforms (SmartPad (Nov.4th), BocaChica (Nov.11th), Skyward (Nov.17th)) are on the NEAR blockchain to develop its ecosystem. \nTotal amount of sale: 1,000,000 $AURORA\nAll the collected proceedings of $AURORA sale will be put into liquidity pools. Aurora Labs will explore the opportunities to incentivize the pools.\nInvestors\nAurora announced its first funding round with $12 million raised in total. Over 100 investors took part in the round with the lead of Pantera Capital, Electric Capital, Dragonfly Capital. The success of the raise reinforces Aurora\u2019s appeal among the community and its objective to bring scaling solutions across the crypto ecosystem.\nStrategic Partner: 1inch, DoDo, Chainlink, Snowswap, Band protocol, Near Protocol, DeFiner, Imtoken...",

In my country there are some national crypto exchanges not known in the rest of the world. Had already tried some of them, but most are annoying, have just a few coins listed, and worst of all: very high trading fees AND withdraws, ranging from 1%\\~2%\n\nSo when i discovered binance was very attractive because its easy, there's a lot of options, stacking, the highest volume and very low fees - which i like most, because i trade very very low $ volume. But after these events etc of course i don't want to lose my money like everyone else, and i'm not intended to keeps withdrawing to wallet everytime cause as i said, i trade low money and the fees ouuuch\n\nWhich exchanges are you guys using?\n\nI have heard of coinbase, kucoin, coinex, OKEX, kraken and many others\n\nbut i have no idea which one i choose, some research still lets me in doubt because, even liking comparison, i think these comparison websites can be manipulative.\n\nI am most interested tho in Kucoin because its token is growing fast, does it worth?\n\nWhich are the most trustful exchanges out there?",

            "text": " BIG NEWS ! Aurum \u2014 rewards and BSC utility token \u2014 has integrated the Chainlink Price Feeds deployed on Binance Smart Chain for the Aurum Wallet. By integrating the industry-leading decentralized oracle network, Aurum has access to high-quality, tamper-proof price feeds needed to provide users with stronger assurances that the token and portfolio value displayed in the Aurum Wallet are secure, accurate, and up-to-date.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cxw3cf6sd5q71.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ea45daeafcf618be89adc8d55578cd5f47ff4bb\n\nThe initial integration involves the use of the following Chainlink Price Feeds:\n\n* ETH\n* BTC\n* ADA\n* XRP\n* BNB\n* BANANA\n* CAKE\n* SAFEMOON\n* SXP\n\nAurum collaborated with Chainlink as their go-to oracle solution because its infrastructure is seamless to integrate and time-tested in production. Chainlink already helps secure leading DeFi protocols responsible for tens of billions of dollars in smart contract value, maintaining robust security and high availability even amidst unexpected events, such as exchange downtime, flash crashes, and dta manipulation attacks via flash loans. \n\nDue for full V1 release in Q4 2021, the Aurum Secure Wallet for BSC tokens, and later for multiple blockchains, aims to be a must-have app for both new and experienced crypto users. Beginning as a browser extension, the wallet will be packed full with the most important tools you need without needing to connect to external sites.\n\nExclusive Aurum Secure Wallet features that will be available upon launch or as future updates:\n\n* Live token charts and transactions in-app\n* Highly accurate live price tracking\n* In-wallet token swapping\n* NFT minting and showcase within-app\n* Multi-chain compatibility\n* Donate to charity button\n* Follow wallet\u2019/\u2019copy trade\u2019 function\n\nThe wallet will open up further possibilities for project partnerships, such as the ability to host other tokens as default listing tokens, access promotional/advertising space and seamlessly integrate with the Aurum Dapp where other reward tokens can be selected.\n\nIn order to help secure accurate, real-time token and portfolio values within the Aurum Secure Wallet, Aurum needed fresh asset prices made available in a highly reliable manner. Fair market asset prices should reflect a volume-weighted average from all trading environments, thus, requiring aggregated price data.\n\nAfter reviewing various solutions, Aurum integrated Chainlink Price Feeds because they provide a multitude of critical features such as:\n\n* **High-Quality Data** \u2014 Chainlink Price Feeds source data from numerous premium data aggregators, leading to price data that\u2019s aggregated from hundreds of exchanges, weighted by volume, and cleaned of outliers and wash trading. Chainlink\u2019s data aggregation model generates more precise global market prices that are inherently resistant to inaccuracies or manipulation of any single or small set of exchanges.\n* **Secure Node Operators** \u2014 Chainlink Price Feeds are secured by independent, security-reviewed, and Sybil-resistant oracle nodes run by leading blockchain DevOps teams, data providers, and traditional enterprises. Chainlink nodes have a strong track record of reliability, even during high gas prices and infrastructure outages.\n* **Decentralized Network** \u2014 Chainlink Price Feeds are decentralized at the data source, oracle node, and oracle network levels, generating strong protections against downtime and tampering by either the data provider or oracle network.\n* **Reputation System** \u2014 Chainlink provides a robust reputation framework and set of on-chain monitoring tools that allow users to independently verify the historical and real-time performance of node operators and oracle networks.\n\nBeyond this current integration, Aurum will look to use additional price feeds from Chainlink in the future, as well as explore the possibility to expand to other chains.\n\n>*\u201cWe could not be more pleased to be working with Chainlink and integrating its high-quality oracle network to help power the Aurum Wallet. Chainlink is a world-renowned decentralized oracle network, which means that one of the core and most frequently used functions of the wallet will be highly secure and reliable.\u201d*\n\nKelvin Ha, Aurum CEO\n\n**About Chainlink**\n\nChainlink is the industry standard oracle network for powering hybrid smart contracts. Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Networks provide developers with the largest collection of high-quality data sources and secure off-chain computations to expand the capabilities of smart contracts on any blockchain. Managed by a global, decentralized community, Chainlink currently secures billions of dollars in value for smart contracts across decentralized finance (DeFi), insurance, gaming, and other major industries.\n\nChainlink is trusted by hundreds of organizations, from global enterprises to projects at the forefront of the blockchain economy, to deliver definitive truth via secure, reliable oracle networks. To learn more about Chainlink, visit their website and subscribe to the Chainlink newsletter. To understand the full vision of the Chainlink Network, read the Chainlink 2.0 whitepaper.\n\n**About Aurum**\n\nAurum ($AUR) aims to be the gold standard of rewards tokens and BSC security. Boasting a powerful and innovative rewards system, Aurum holders have the freedom to select any BEP-20 token as an automatically redistributed reward straight to their wallet, increasing the ease and convenience of portfolio diversification without the need for additional capital.\n\nIn terms of utility, the Aurum Secure Wallet, now powered by Chainlink for BSC tokens, aims to collate all the vital tools both new and experienced investors will need in one sleek, safe, and convenient app, offering live and accurate price feeds and portfolio value, inbuilt swap, NFT minting and much more.",

            "text": "***Key changes summarised:***\n\n**LOWER SUPPLY**\\- Gone are the days of quadrillions and an endless amount of zeros - they will be proportionally reducing their supply from 1 quadrillion to 1 billion \u2014 everyone will get the exact same percentage holding proportionally \u2014 so your holdings will be worth the exact same.\n\n**REDUCED TAX-** It was known that the current high tax rates have been a deterrent for many new buyers \u2014 this will now been reduced down to 10% which is particularly important since utility coins rarely have high taxes.\n\n**REDUCED GAS FEES-** They have fully optimised many of the smart contract features to cut gas fees significantly making trading and getting rewarded by $AUR much more efficient.\n\n**LOWER MINIMUM THRESHOLD TO RECEIVE REWARDS-** They have listened to investor feedback regarding the minimum holding to receive rewards. This will now be over 90% lower, from what is current 11billion to 1 billion AUR \u2014 this will be 1000 AUR on the upgraded contract.\n\n**DYNAMIC RESPONSIVE TAX SYSTEM-** They will be able to adjust their taxes to increase/decrease rewards, marketing, buybacks according to the needs of the community.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cqqvhupp4hp71.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7fdb01b7153c3715316d4b578c506ae32466452\n\n***The Migration Process:***\n\nAll holders will automatically be airdropped the new token in the following ratio with no minimum holding requirement and no restrictions (to reflect the total supply changing):\n\nNEW TOKEN : OLD TOKEN\n\n1 : 1.000.000\n\nPlease note your new holding will have exactly the same value as your previous holding from when they halt transactions to when they redeploy since you will retain the same percentage of the total supply.\n\n***Aurum Contract Upgrade:*** what I would like to know:\n\n*Why are they relaunching again?*\n\nThis is **not** a relaunch. Yes, they are upgrading their Smart Contract but everything else will remain the same \u2014 their name, branding, product developments, roadmap etc.\n\n*When will this be happening?*\n\nThey are waiting upon Solidity Finance to finish auditing the new contract \u2014 they will then rearrange a new date for ApeSwap listing and deployment of the new contract. They will announce dates on all of their socials once this is all confirmed.\n\n*What do I need to do to get the new token?*\n\nNothing \u2014 other than add the new contract address on Trust Wallet or Metamask. Bitmart holders should automatically receive the upgraded AUR in their wallet.\n\n*Why will I get less tokens? What will my new tokens be worth?*\n\nInvestors will receive the exact same percentage of the total supply as they held before. This means the value of their holdings from when Aurum stop transactions to when they redeploy on the new contract will be the same .\n\n*Why have rewards percentages been lowered?*\n\nHigh percentage rewards can be very lucrative but only if trading volume is present. Aurum strongly believe that having lower taxes overall will be more attractive to new investors and generate greater net rewards overall. On top of this, due to their dynamic tax system, they have the option of increasing rewards percentages as and when required (i.e. double rewards week promotions) so they can actually have limited periods where they set rewards higher than they were previously.\n\n*What if you change the dynamic taxes to 100%?*\n\nTheir dynamic tax system is capped at 20% - it can never go higher than this.\n\n*Will this affect Aurum Wallet development or release?*\n\nNo \u2014 Aurum Wallet is being developed completely separately and contract upgrade will not affect this.\n\n*What's happening with the Aurum Wallet development?*\n\n* Having resubmitted their latest build to Google Web Store \u2014 the Phase 1 Beta of the Aurum Wallet release is finally upon us. Privacy Policy and Storage Permissions have been addressed and they will be revealing the release date shortly.\n* They apologise for the delays and in future will not be setting any exact release dates until they are confident they can fully and comprehensively meet those deadlines.\n* This release will be accompanied by a Wallet Roadmap- detailing future features being included in the upcoming updates and approximate timelines.\n\n*What's up with the Aurum Pressure Vault?*\n\nAfter a sustained battle, Admonkey has taken this week\u2019s Aurum Pressure Vault top spot, earning themselves the buying pressure from the Gold Pressure Vault and the top featured spot on the *Rewards dashboard.*\n\n*How is the Web development going?*\n\n* The design of the mobile version of the new website is being finalised this week. The last pieces of website content are currently being written. They now have two web developers ready to begin the coding stage to react which is estimated to take around 4 weeks.\n* Mock up designs of the new Rewards Dashboard Dapp design have been completed. They will be looking to integrate this into the new website.\n\n*Are you developing more Partnerships?*\n\nOnce the Solidity Finance audit of the new Smart Contract is complete, they will be able to set an official date for ApeSwap partnership and listing.\n\nThey will be announcing the partnership they have with the Top 20 project on Monday 27th September!\n\n*Are you preparing a marketing campaign?*\n\n* They have prepared more press releases in Tier 1 publications, scheduled for their upcoming partnerships and wallet release.\n* Aurum will also be invited for an AMA within the ApeSwap Reddit community and be featured on the ApeSwap socials (with over 150k followers).\n* Further strategies and actions ahead of full release of wallet will be rolled out gradually as per last week\u2019s AMA update \u2014 CMC airdrop, Crypto Twitter influencers, Crypto Youtubers, giveaways etc.\n\n*Do you have more charity donations planned?*\n\nAfter the $1000 donation to Kids In Need of Defence, the next charity shortlisted for a community chosen donation will be World Orphans added to the existing charities: Sea Sheppard[ ](https://www.seashepherd.org.uk/)and Direct Relief. Voting will be undertaken on their Twitter page this week.\n\n***Aurum have a LIVE Twitch AMA on Tuesday 28th September detailing their future partnerships, listings and Wallet release date!***\n\nI will be following up on Aurum very closely and keep a keen eye on developments!\n\nAs always DYOR on their own TG channel AurOfficial !",

I have roughly 3k that I'll start off investing with and with put it in bitcoin and ethereum.\n\n\\> I want to store my crypto offline in what I think you guys call them cold wallets? Which one would you guys suggest. Also is the process Live Wallet (i.e. Exodus) ----> Cold wallet (i.e Trezor). How do I initially actually buy the bitcoin + ethereum?\n\n\\>Further to my first point I want to stake the crypto as well, is it possible to do it out of a cold wallet and how does it work? Is there a high level of technical knowledge needed to do this?\n\nAny other beginner information would be greatly helpful!",

Can operate as if an investment bank.  \n* Smartlands intend to be the #1 force in Ukraine under the law \u2013 can work with banks, security commissions, investment firms and on an equal footing.  \n* Allowing the issuance of digital assets opens up lots of benefits to Ukraine and its economy, favourable for investments worldwide. Institutional investors across the world can safely invest in Ukrainian businesses and real estate.  \n* Link with the CBDC being worked on with Stellar, which relates to the digital currency law already signed by the Ukrainian President and the central bank will issue a CBDC on the Stellar blockchain \\[*rumour... for now\\]*.    \n\n   * It means the entire infrastructure required for digital assets becomes effortless and completely linked to the CBDC blockchain, transfers to banks and between institutions will be seamless \u2013 with stellar accounts opened for users.  \n   * Banks will be able to open Stellar accounts for users *\\[if so, wow!\\]*  \n* **Why SLT and why Smartlands?**    \n\n   * Investing lots of resources into the development of the platform; developing an ABT marketplace, smart contract platform, wallet etc.  \n   * Will allow everybody in the world to invest in digital assets on the Stellar blockchain effortlessly.  \n   * With one click you can buy security tokens issued on the Stellar blockchain.  \n   * Could have launched a number of months ago, but wanted to improve the user experience and were given legal advice to wait for the laws to pass so they could be fully compliant. Laws have now passed, Smartlands are ready to go!  \n* **Q4 roadmap sets out the path ahead**    \n\n   * Early Q4 Smartlands will have the first deal on the platform, closed and sorted out in November. First payment going to token holders on 1st December.  \n   * Smartlands are focused very carefully on quality control, primarily commercial real estate with long term plans and stable revenue flow. This will enable safer investments to be tokenized successfully with known yield.  \n   * Partnership with Big U will provide access to Small and Medium Enterprises, giving SMEs new ways to raise funds for business and retail investors ways to be involved. Announcement on this coming in a few weeks.  \n   * Stellar network will grant you access to all these investment opportunities, fully compliant with the law and available to retail investors. Truly a gamechanger.  \n   * Smartlands are receiving new phone calls each week with asset owners and potential partners, interested in developing new opportunities \u2013 just had a conversation with a company in Singapore ready to move forward, and in negotiations with the Chairman of a British company that runs care homes.  \n   * Huge pile of things in place and ready to announce soon. All going live in October and November, then we will get all the details. Another interview will come soon.  \n\nMake sure to watch the full video as there are lots of details in there about how Smartlands is situated to take advantage of this new crypto-revolution in Ukraine, along with more general talk about the important of asset tokenization and the flexibility it unlocks for both asset owners and investors.  \n\nThe new laws being passed in Ukraine are truly a game-changer and Smartlands have front row seats!   \n\nThis is a repost from r/320prophecy and all credit for the recap goes to him.",

The   world is now   at  the forefront of a system that extends unprecedented   financial    sovereignty where no one can control your money.\n\nThanks      to Mathematical Algorithms, dependence on individuals and    institutions   to transact and invest is coming to an abrupt and    decisive end. We are   now in an age where you can transact without    entrusting your money to   someone you don\u2019t know from Adam,    irrespective of geographical  position.\n\nToday,    most  Traditional  Financial (TradFi) services and products like    derivatives,  insurance,  AMM, liquidity pools, assets management,    borrowing, lending,  futures,  oracles, among others, are all on the    Blockchain. The most  significant  feature about the whole development    is the ability to engage  these  instruments within a few minutes is  the   unprecedented  transparency it  affords.\n\nWithout     the irritating  inconveniences associated with TradFi, DeFi brings a     holistic approach  to investment that will eventually make the  former    obsolete in all  spheres. Come to think of how you can  transact in a    trustless  environment with no single point of failure.\n\nTotal     Value Locked  (TVL) in DeFi protocols keeps rising with innovative     features,  products, and services. The stimulating trend these days is     that you  don\u2019t just have to hodl your Crypto assets, but you can     leverage them to  earn passive income in copious means using     non-custodial wallets.\n\nBictory Finance\u2019s Role\n\nAt     Bictory Finance,  our contribution to this extraordinary financial     revolution is a  novelty pedestal of tools that drives seamless     navigation of the Crypto  market for Traders, Developers, Liquidity     Providers, and Startups. We  extend an interoperable, thoroughly-fledged     DEX and CEX, working in  synergy with a decentralized crowdfunding     platform for value exchange.\n\nIn   a    cross-chain era where Blockchains interact to execute an agnostic      environment, we are building Bictory on Concordium, a  privacy-oriented,     public, and permissionless Blockchain coming soon  to chains like     Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana, and others. The  multichain layer presents     unlimited opportunities in the burgeoning  open, decentralized finance     market.\n\nThese   are market-ready    tools the industry is yet to experience and  utilize  for sustainable    benefits.

            "text": "Jan 17th: Why is the Market Crashing (BTC Options, Whales, Correction, FUD, Hack, Conferences)?, Maximize Profits During Bull Runs Minimize Losses During Bear Raids\n\nToday\u2019s Report (17th):\n\n\u201cWhy is the market crashing?!\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve had this as a headline more times than I can count in the last 48hrs. The answer to this question is both short and long. The short answer is this week we\u2019ve seen a wallet hack which always creates fear in the crypto world. The reality a 3rd party may enter what you presumed to be a safe place and remove your valuable crypto creates hysteria within the crypto community, especially for newcomers. There have been 2 FUD attacks this week, one out of China and one out of South Korea. Both have been topics of previous posts so to keep it short and sweet: FUD attacks mean a dramatic correction in the market. Almost immediately once South Korea\u2019s was dispelled, China\u2019s was released not allowing any market recovery time. I also discussed whale consolidation. It is easy to go on KuCoin and see the whales at play openly shifting sell and buy walls when the orders approach allowing the price to fluctuate more dramatically, while also pushing it in a specific direction. This is easily visible on KuCoin with people using 5-10BTC. That is $50,000-$100,000. These whales are playing in KuCoin\u2019s open waters with what most of us see as a good amount of money, but to real investors it is chump change.\n\nThis brings me to my new point for today. The December Option Contracts.\n\nAnyone want to guess what day those December options expire in January? January 17th. Want to guess what side the majority of hedge fund guys bet on? If you saw BTC\u2019s chart and were in the stock/commodity industry you\u2019d be screaming SHORT. So we have a group of multi millionaire/billionaires trying to find out a way to cash out up against a BTC that was well above their option price (last week). If you are short you hope the price will decrease, if you are long you hope the price will increase. People who shorted BTC have until today to make it crash further. Cashing in on their short position while it\u2019s under $10k and then using their profits to buy back in and actually go long on BTC for the short term because they know they just intentionally crashed the market and with a negative correction comes a positive one eventually.\n\nWe, even I, am a Plankton compared to the whales and sharks trading BTC futures on the CBOE and CME. I can try to predict market functions based on graphs and trends. I can attempt to find undervalued assets in a market full of scams and billion dollar coins. What I cannot do is control whales and sharks with 1000x the money I am investing openly manipulating the crypto markets the day options expire. People have been asking when will this market correction occur? The honest answer is no one knows. The reality is that we have conferences starting tomorrow, literally tomorrow. These continue through the weekend and continue through March. If I were a betting man, which I am, I would say the correction begins sometime tonight after option expiration or tomorrow pre-conference. This will lead into a bull run which will draw many new investors into the market similarly to what happened pre-Thanksgiving and the bull run we all experienced until just now.\n\nBTC has had 5 price corrections since 2015. I\u2019d include the graph/chart but it won\u2019t let me, so I will try to explain it to you. The total negative correction period was between 5 and 35 days for all 5 events. That means as we are approaching 1 month in BTC\u2019s price correction since it hit almost 20k we are about at the end of the statistical period BTC takes to correct. Each one of these corrections BTC saw a loss in value between 30% and 50%. The current correction we are in places BTC at almost a 50% loss. So we are at the parameters for length of time to correct, and correction amount. The final question, following these prior 4 corrections, how long did it take to attain a new ATH? How long will it be before my portfolio makes me look rich again!? The period for the past events was 8-55 days. Considering thus far BTC has mimicked all its trends to date, I expect it to take 8-55 days before we have a full recovery to a new ATH. Personally I expect it to be on the lower end of that range as I see the entire sector having exponentially more media exposure the next 3 months which should dramatically increase the value of BTC and alts. As the world is exposed and re-exposed to crypto the bull run should build steam. My prediction (that is all it is, a prediction) would be it takes approximately 3-4 weeks to reach a new ATH for BTC. With the $1 trillion market cap (for all of crypto) mark pierced long before May.\n\nI\u2019ve lost close to 30% this week. Most in the market lost much more than that! I highlighted opportunities like NEO, ICX and STRAT which were top gainers among many losers the past few days (even though almost everything dropped yesterday). Having a diversified portfolio between strong coins and moonshots helps weather any future storm. This has not been a fun correction for any of us. Please stop messaging me irate about market conditions. I cannot predict FUD, Hacks, or Dev team issues. I can try to predict when this turn around will occur (as early as tomorrow with option expiration and conferences starting). If you are that irate where you need to talk to someone or post a 6-page essay below feel free to call me: 800-273-8255 (Suicide Hotline). The crypto space has 50% market swings in 1 week. It also has 400% gains in following weeks. If you sell now you are giving those future gains to someone else. HOLD FAST KINGDOM.\n\nThis concludes the educational portion of today, if you\u2019d like a topic reported on please let me know and I\u2019d be happy to add it this week! I usually write a Daily Crypto Report that includes 1. Lessons (similar to above), 2. Safe Picks for January), 3. Conference Plays (from the above conferences), 4. Moonshot Explanations (multiple coins up over 400% in 2 weeks), and 5. ICOs! Feel free to follow me if you\u2019d like to see today\u2019s full report vs. just the educational lesson portion. If you have any topics you want explored please let me know!\n\n(Favorites Remain ICX, STRAT, and NEO as Buy and Hold) My 3 favorite January SAFE plays remain ICX, STRAT, and NEO. NEO has more conferences than any other coin in the next 2 weeks and meetups all over Europe prior to that. NEO is the Asian Ether and should rapidly increase in value in the next 3 weeks. STRAT will remain a favorite of mine as they are launching their ICO Platform and have 2 flagship ICOs ready to be announced (they are timing the down market waiting for a correction, I guarantee it). The founder of STRAT also recently posted on his twitter regarding how exciting next week will be. The market correction is about to be over and there will be many new coins at the forefront of the financial revolution. The FUD started in South Korea and ICX crashed because of it. They still have their first HOSTED blockchain event during their mainnet release the last week of January in the tallest building in Seoul. All 3 make up a major portion of my \u201csafe plays\u201d for January with an expected return of 40-100%.\n\nEveryone is always asking about which ICOs I\u2019m involved in and recommend. If you want to know the ICOs or need referral links for Ku or Binance PM me :)",

The tech is there, yes. XRB is great, transaction speeds and cost rivaling that of VISA/Mastercard (50-100bn space right there). At some point, we have to realize EVERYTHING is over valued right now. Some tech is inherently better than others, but at this point everything is about increasing $$$ rather than increasing speed.\n\nWe still have the few purists who do stick to posting revolutionary breakthroughs, new advances, etc, but almost everything is shitposts, memes, and \"investment\" strategy. Even the HODLers have to realize like 99% of their gains came recently, so they're just as new to this shit as everybody else.\n\nIf you invest with the goal of creating a profit, realize it's okay to invest in a pyramid scheme. There is absolutely money to be made in a pyramid scheme. But please also realize that the vast majority of you are closer to the base than to the tip. The market is manipulated, it's very black and white. By who? You can speculate all you want. Tether, Wall Street, PnDs by the smaller whales, it doesn't matter. As long as you're aware you have very little control and you're okay with that, then it's all good.",

If that were true - if you're holding over long term and you're trying to protect yourself - you'd ideally want to hold for 2 weeks, sell to something like USDT for 2 weeks and then continue that cycle?

This is the time when you see people making Insane profits on alts.\n\nThere's a good tendency that most alts will pump during a bull run but there's always this one legit coin out there that doesn't get enough attention as much as it deserves. \n\nThe essence of this post would be to bring light and attention to those Cryptos we think are undervalued and deserves to be getting much more attention than it does currently, not an attempt to pump your bags but rather creating awareness and I'll go first.\n\n**SYLO**\n\nNow I think SYLO is easily the most underrated low cap Crypto I've seen. You might wonder why if you've never heard of it before or know what it's all about.\n\nSylo is an ecosystem made up of digital consumer wallet software, applications, infrastructure & developer tools to usher in a world of Smart Money. Sylo is a smart wallet application with multiple features like messaging, Crypto support, DeFi features, NFT support as well as payment options.\n\nYou can think of the Sylo app as your regular messenger app which has metamask integrated into it which allows you to chat, call and store your assets easily on the same app. It allows you to chat in a decentralized manner while being sure that your data and private information are safe and not being sold. \n\nThe surprising part is that SYLO has a very small market cap of $17million(at the time of writing this) and it's Listed on Kucoin, Gates, Bittrex and uniswap. \n\nI think anyone would agree with me that a coin with this kind of product and fundamentals should be valued higher than this. \n\nNow shoot me those undervalued altcoins no one is talking about. Let's go.",

LINK is enabling the first genuinely useful applications of smart contracts/DLT that I've ever seen. proverbial wet dream.\n\n\\-vast majority of top defi projects completely reliant on link's tech/oracles, yet it's only ranked \\~#15 in mcap\n\n\\-substantial % of the top 100 projects have integrated LINK in some respect\n\n\\-cefi starting to on-board with LINK (e.g. celsius) \n\n\\-if big banks/SWIFT ever integrate blockchain/DLT, reliable oracles will be absolutely necessary. link = proven industry standard for oracles. enormous upside potential here.  \n\n\\-have hired 100+ employees over the past year, with over 100 job openings available atm.\n\n\\-sergey\n\n\\-have worked with the team in a professional (i.e work) setting. they have their shit together.\n\n\\-extremely obvious price suppression, been in crypto since $70 btc and haven't seen anything like it - besides maybe the VET suppression in 2017. \n\n\\-memes\n\nlinkpool arguments:\n\n\\-my personal opinion is that operating a link node today is the closest \"second chance\" anyone will ever get to mining btc in \\~2011-2015. \n\n\\-individuals cannot run nodes at this time\n\n\\-linkpool is one of the (if not THE) most established nodes in the ecosystem. as a result, they get more jobs + bigger jobs + more rewards + etc.\n\n\\-staking LPL = you get a slice of the top node's (LPL's) LINK rewards\n\n\\-staking LPL = you get a slice of \"early access\" to formal LINK staking (when live)\n\n\\-basically, by staking LPL, i'll be mindlessly printing LINK for the next 10 years. \n\n\\-i personally see this as like - one of those services where you pay someone to mine BTC for you - except i'm painfully early",

XRB - decentralized, simple transactions that are free, quick and scalable, excellent P2P applications, expert and focused team, eco friendly, impending binance listing, impending fix of node/withdraw issue, price bump from future rebranding to NANO, far from too late to buy in (I bought very early and plan to hold)\n\n2. BTC - mass name recognition, store of value, robust security, OG crypto, lots of support of devs, hard forks, lightning network, Segwit wallets (Needs to deal with scaling issues)\n\n3. SUB - getting around censorship/firewalls, lower market cap, privacy, great team, lots of room for growth in market cap, efficient coin transactionally (I bought in early and has been a strong performer for me)\n\n4. XRP - centralized (personally not a huge fan of centralized coins), major corporate backing, quick, cheap, and scalable transactions (I bought XRP to hedge against the risk that the corporations win out in crypto... I hope they don't honestly, but they are tricky and fickle institutions)\n\n5. ICX - complex transactions, atomic swaps, low fees, quick and scalable transactions, lots of room for growth in market cap \n\n6. KCS - passive income through daily dividends (need to have a large amount for this to be worth it), growing exchange successfully adding new coins daily, tons of room for growth in both dividends and market cap increases, on big discount right now  \n\n7. DRGN - family privacy, Disney backing with direct use cases for current/future Disney operations, low market cap, currently found on Kucoin\n\n8. REQ - making crypto accessible to the masses by making a PayPal style button for crypto, aggressive Q1 objectives, low market cap, quality team, quick low cost transfers\n\n9. BNB - a solid exchange bound to grow, 50% off fees when using BNB on Binance, grants Binance voting rights, strong community\n\n10. NEO - quick, cheap transactions, dividends paid as GAS, complex transactions, regulation conscience, Dapps (Full disclosure recently sold my holding of NEO still like it though might even buy back)\n\n\n\n**Let me know what you think of my list and share your own or however many you hold :)**\n\n\n**EDIT 1:** Here are a few coins which are far risker and lower market cap. I have put some money into them as a gamble (I understand these could be a scam/flop and so should you! Im currently up quite a bit on ECA and PHO but I got in much earlier)\n\nPHO: Merge mining, currently trading on c-patex (kinda sketch new exchange), paused on Cryptopia (where I got my PHO; Cryptopia seems to be working on getting PHO back operational), very low market cap, extreme risk/reward\n\nECA: Mobile phone mining, eco friendly, found on a bunch of sketchy exchanges including currently down coinsmarkets (where I got my ECA), very low market cap, extreme risk/reward \n\nXAS: LISK of China, currently on Kucoin (pretty solid exchange imo for low market cap coins), higher market cap then PHO and ECA but still low, decentralized, just bought a small amount in response to this post\n\n**EDIT 2:** This post caused me to buy a small amount of XLM (less risky), VEN (risky), APPC (risky) and XAS (risky) thanks for the advice all!\n\nXLM: Efficient currency, IBM partnership, some room for growth, FairX, just reinvested in this coin after selling in the past and bought small amount due to this post \n\nAPPC: Dedicated team, Crypto apps, low market cap, undervalued, on binance, just bought small amount due to this post (Need to do more research on this before recommending)\n\nVEN: Quality team, deep corporate ties/partnerships, hardware patents, currently on Binance, Chinese connections, Dapps, just bought a small amount in response to this post\n\n**EDIT 3:** For fun here are some of the most talked about coins in the discussion over the past 21 hours that are not mentioned above just going to list names in no particular order thanks for contributing your time:\n\nIOTA, TRX, WAX, OMG, LINK, QSP, ARK, EOS",

                    "response": "I'm not much of a day trader-- I sometimes swing trade, but most of my portfolio consists of longer term positions. I also believe the biggest long term rewards will be in platform/enterprise projects, and my investments also follow as such. \n\n1) Stellar Lumens (XLM)-- Officially and transparently backed by IBM, FairX exchange will allow for direct alt trading without dependence on BTC, platform coin that allows for numerous horizontal integrations, ICO's and other applications. \n\n2) NEO-- They are actually realizing the vision of being a platform with numerous apps and a robust ecosystem built on their system. \n\n3) Vechain (VEN)-- While I like other supply chain oriented coins such as WTC and WABI, I think that VEN has the biggest upside because of their numerous terrific partnerships and great team. For those who don't know, VEN is a supply chain/logistics platform that uses RFID technology with blockchain to streamline supply chains. So many use cases for this one, and they're about to have a rebrand coming up as well. \n\n4) Cardano (ADA)-- I love Cardano because the team is phenomenal (a lot of PHDs, scientists, and engineers), and they are very academically oriented-- all their work is peer-reviewed. They are also a platform-- while their full product is not launched yet, there's a ton of upside here. \n\n5) Monero (XMR)-- One of the spaces where there is a big opportunity for crypto is in the privacy space. For actual transacting, I think this space sees the most use for crypto currency, especially in dark web commerce. Unlike projects like XVG (all hype), XMR has a great team and a real working product, and are continuing to work on innovations like IP masking to make it even more secure. \n\n6)ICON (ICX)-- This one is extremely undervalued because of the Korea FUD and if you want solid partnerships, look no further than Icon. This coin is primed for a huge jump in the coming months with their mainnet launch on 1/24 and their publicity event on 1/31. I think Icon could be $30 by march. \n\nOther projects that I think are great holds in 2018 for a variety of reasons--\n\n7) EOS\n8) OmiseGo (OMG)\n9) Simple Token (OST)\n10) IOTA \n11) Funfair (FUN)\n12) Ethereum (ETH)-- I know this isn't every exciting, but I believe in the flippening and I think that Ethereum could hit $3000 by the end of 2018. \n\nAlso, I should add that I don't believe in the upside of KCS unless you're holding the 1000 needed to get your trading fees discounted. The dividends are distributed across every currency on the exchange and you're getting pennies at a time, meaning it's going to be a while before you even have enough to consolidate by selling. Many of them will lose value before you have enough to sell. Also remember that they are ramping down the dividend from 50% of fees to 15%, so even as exchange volume increases the dividend will not accelerate a huge amount. You could easily open a Wealthfront account with high risk tolerance and put the ~15k it would take to buy 1000 KCS and make 10% a year on it. \n\nI have a background in business/finance, happy to answer any questions from anybody curious about my picks or questions about crypto/the market in general. \n\nEDIT: Added ICON",

The CEO mentioned that a lot of partnerships are coming off NDAs and they are going through a re-branding process. I'm expecting big things out of this one over the next couple months.\n\nETH - Solid growth, I prefer it over BTC as my \"safe bet\" but I'm not afraid to trade it if BTC goes full bull.\n\nWAX - Got in on the ico. Only been in the markets for a couple weeks so it hasn't had much movement yet. Basically its a currency for trading digital items in a market place, but it'll be able to be used for tangible items too. Hoping for big things out of this one too this year.\n\nI have smaller positions in a couple others and watching a bunch more, but I like these the most currently.",

Maybe save it for later when you see this narrative being pushed around so you can come back and get the other side. \n\nEDIT 2: TL:DR - Most negative analysis on this sub lately of Tether are likely from a single biased source that stretches a lot to make his points, and there is simply not enough Tether in the market nor is it concentrated enough to create a catastrophic problem or significant inflation for any USDT currency pair.\n\n\nLike many of you, I have heard the stories and posts about the fraudulent tether, I trade in this space on many exchanges and the growing concern is worrying, so I did my due diligence, and I would like to share it with the community.\n\n\nFirst and most importantly IMO, all this controversy stems from just one account/person. A person on twitter going by the handle @Bitfinexed - https://twitter.com/Bitfinexed \n\n\nHere you can see this person's writings - https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/latest\n\n\nSpoofy, Tethers and institutional investors are what they contend to be the lies and fraud, AND that this entire rally in 2017 is based on fraudulent Tethers and spoofing, and that this will implode the markets.\n\n\nI feel this is also important\u2026 Turns out this person sold at $1000, maybe the real reason he is on this mission??\u2026 \nhttps://twitter.com/whalepool/status/896460700461277185\n\n\nNow for some troubling info, the majority of this narrative (FUD??) here on Reddit in the last month come from just three accounts.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/AtlasRand1/submitted/\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/cetusfund/submitted/\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/AnythingForSuccess\n\n\nAs you can see these accounts entire mission is to post constantly about this. They all show up on the other\u2019s post to comment regularly. \n\n\nBtw, some people on the pro-finex side think this is a smear campaign from other exchanges. I don\u2019t believe this to be the case. This person(s) only talk about Tether/Finex, yet Tether is used and traded by the $millions daily on 3 of the top 5 exchanges, Finex, Bittrex, Polo, yet never a word about those other exchanges. (Check the USDT volume on other exchanges)\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/assets/tether/#markets \n\n\nTherefore, if it is an exchange, it isn\u2019t Trex/Polo because this would affect them as well. If it was an exchange other than Trex/Polo they would have plenty of fire power against 3 of the top 5 exchanges with Tether fraud.\n\n\nThis leads me to believe it is most likely a sad person(s) with an ax to grind. They might have lost their $ on Finex to what they believe are spoofers/fraud and or they were part of the finex hack and sold there BFX too early. \n\n\nBtw I see contention that Bitfinex did NOT pay back the $ from the hack. They did, but some people are mad because they sold BFX early and didn\u2019t recoup full $ amount from haircuts, but that was their decision. \n\n\n~\nPOINTS OF CONTENTION\n\n\n\nSPOOFING\nThis is what set my alarm bells off about these articles I read from Bitfinexed. Specifically spoofing\u2026 https://hackernoon.com/meet-spoofy-how-a-single-entity-dominates-the-price-of-bitcoin-39c711d28eb4 \n\n\nand this nugget\u2026\u201cAnd who the hell is going to go margin long so dramatically after a huge crash?\u201d from this article\u2026 https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/are-fraudulent-tethers-being-used-for-margin-lending-on-bitfinex-5de9dd80f330\n\n\nClaiming spoofing shows this person has limited markets/trading knowledge. Clearly they haven\u2019t watched an order book of any exchange in crypto, equities, or Forex. \n\n\nThis is called scalping or scare walls. Again this is done in every market around the globe. \n\n\nHere is a professional FOREX trader talking about scalping, how it works, who/why they do it. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYMIPmgRb_M&list=WL&index=94\n\n\nTL;DW - they do this to get the price where they want it because they know people are watching the order book (the video is quite enlightening), and the key point that keeps this from being an illegal activity (on regulated exchanges) is THAT THEY DO MAKE TRADES FOR THOSE SIZES eventually. This doesn\u2019t always work and they get stuck in these positions. Risk/reward.\n\n\nThe ironic part about this spoofing idea is Finex is one of the few, if not only exchanges, that offer hidden orders. So people trying to scalp always have to worry if there is a monster hidden order lurking.  \n\n\nGo to the UPDATE: AUGUST 7TH of this story and watch the video he claims proves spoofing and Phil Potter admitting it in the voice over. https://hackernoon.com/meet-spoofy-how-a-single-entity-dominates-the-price-of-bitcoin-39c711d28eb4 \n\n\nI see nothing wrong with what Phil says and no proof of anything in the video. Again this is true on every exchange trading anything of volume in the world. People with large amounts of money move markets, oh the horror. I \u201ctechnically\u201d do this when I place an order and pull it for whatever reason (scared, mistake, etc.) just not in large sums, but I would if I had large sums. \n\n\n\u201cAnd who the hell is going to go margin long so dramatically after a huge crash?\u201d The crash they are referring to is from the early June ATH to the mid-July correction. A 45-day crash? Well, I am one of those people that went margin long. And many many others who read charts, resistance, support, retracement info. Again, this smacks of someone who doesn\u2019t know what they are talking about.\n\n\n\nREASON FOR PRICE RISE/BTC GOES UP WHEN TETHERS ARE CREATED\n\n\nThis is absurd. This completely negates everything else, the Japanese currency ruling and them entering the market, Koreans coming into the market in a huge way (they now have the largest exchange by far with close to a Billion traded DAILY, oh and they don\u2019t use Tether at all), the successful hard fork, or the more (positive!) interest from the media and people than ever before in BTC history.  \n\n\nInstead, we are supposed to think that $395 million dollars of tethers are the reason for this rise in a $160+ Billion market cap.\n\ufffc\n\nC\u2019mon people! Look at that volume for the last 30 days.\n https://imgur.com/a/vKJ5g\nAlso, the overwhelming majority of trade does not exist in Tether but KRW, CNY, USD, JPY. \n\n\nTethers are usually created when extra liquidity is needed, be it a crash or a spike. Because more people are trading. \n\n\nThey try to prove Tether boosts the market with this picture in their article.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/274SE\n\n\nThe problem is 2 of the last 3 tether dumps coincide with a downturn. In fact, there is nothing in this graph that proves this theory. Also, the last tether dump/price rise coincides perfectly with the news of the majority of miners signaling segwit2x for the first time (search r/bitcoin or r/btc around that date). \n\n\nSo do you think the market traded billions of $ at that time because of a $50 million Tether dump or because for the first time in YEARS a solution and path forward became visible??\n\n\n\n\nTHEY DON\u2019T HAVE BANKING//NO INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS/FAKE TETHERS-TERMS OF SERVICE\n\n\nIn regards to banking, clearly they have some kind of banking and a way for large amounts of fiat to get in and out. The banking is not for you and me but for regional bitcoin exchanges and other large customers. \n\n\nYou know how I know this? If they didn\u2019t the internet would be flooded with Finex withdrawal issues, there would be a price premium on Bitfinex compared to other exchanges, just like Mt. Gox had for so long and also Bitfinex earlier in the year when the banking issues started. \n\n\nThis article explains it very clearly (seriously read this article), it has nothing to do with this controversy, just the banking issue in April.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@Austerity_Sucks/why-bitfinex-went-from-a-premium-in-its-crypto-usd-pairs-to-now-a-significant-discount-e7be193d7cb0 \n\n\nTL;DR - All of the imbalances discussed (Finex premium) have been a result of USD frictions into Bitfinex. It has been a chain reaction resulting from the initial freeze to the various gradual withdrawal options. As soon as Bitfinex conclusively addresses the USD flow issues, the crypto pair prices will normalize (which they did) with other exchanges that don\u2019t have banking frictions and USDT price will return to par (which it did).\n\n\nThe premiums on Finex and Tether are what would prove something is wrong, yet they are not here. Surprisingly Finex has been at a discount to GDAX and GEMINI recently. Meaning people are willing to take a loss on prices to be able to lend on Finex. This too will normalize as people/bots arb. \n\n\nAug 9th\u2026 From \u201carguably\u201d bank fraud\nhttps://twitter.com/Bitfinexed/status/895339675120013313\n\n\nAug 22nd\u2026. To \u201cadmitting\u201d bank fraud\nhttps://twitter.com/Bitfinexed/status/900230917196836864\n\n\nListen to that audio in the second link, listen carefully. His explanation is perfectly reasonable. Banks don\u2019t work well, consistently, or at all with crypto related companies (marijuana companies too for that matter) especially in jurisdictions that are outside US/Europe. Surprise surprise, this is nothing new.  When they find out customers, deposits/wire are cryptos related they pull the plug (a reason why Trex/Polo don\u2019t mess with USD). \n\n\nAlso, they gave their customers a haircut, probably a lot of complaints about the hack to Wells Fargo and other banks. These are the correspondent's banks, not Finex\u2019s, they have banking. This is how they can receive large institutional deposits and withdrawals. Which I bet make up the majority of the fiat deposits and withdrawals. \n\n\nClassic 80/20 business rule, 20% of your clients are providing 80% of the liquidity plus you are having banking issues (which is expected in crypto-land), so you cut this service to the 80% saving time/resources/headaches for the 20% loss in a single service to them (no fiat withdrawal/deposits- but crypto flows in and out with ease).\n\n\nAgain if they weren\u2019t able to get money in and out there would be a premium, there would be a long line of complaints online. I have no reason (or proof) to believe that money is NOT coming into/out of the exchange.\n\n\nIt makes total sense too, they are the best lending platform, have one of the most liquid exchanges, and have by far the most reliable and best software/servers/UI/order options. You cannot deny this fact, they are constantly a top 3 exchange in volume, even after a hack.\n\n\nI use Finex (as well as others) because of all those things. Also, they have already been hacked, a second hack seems less likely (IMO, they have more to lose with another hack). They have many big events on the horizon (Ethfinex). Would a company be putting resources into these things if this is all fraud or an exit scam? I find that unlikely. Is this 100% full proof? Of course not, nothing is, especially in crypto, just my reasons for trading there.\n\n\n\nInstitutional Investors -  https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/are-legitimate-institutional-investors-really-coming-onto-bitfinex-s-platform-i-don-t-think-so-cb4ed5175092\nHere is what this person doesn\u2019t comprehend, what if these institutional investors are\u2026 you ready\u2026 here it comes\u2026 other exchanges that use Tether, as well as other crypto related businesses. It is only $395 million Tethers. These exchanges (Trex, Finex, Polo) are printing money. \n\n\nThis isn\u2019t \u201csomeone\u201d with 100\u2019s of millions of dollars as the article suggests, it\u2019s many people with millions/thousands of dollars. Again this all ignores the fact that many more people have entered the ecosystem this year. This is proven by Coinbase growth, transaction growth, and exchange growth (both in volume and # of exchanges), and growth in crypto-related sub-Reddits. \n\n\nYet Bitfinexed is shocked that lending hits ATH\u2019s, but it is perfectly explainable and reasonable based on the evidence and data of gthe ecosystem. Let us not forget BTC is a finite amount, more people are going to increase demand/price, if you think this is a bubble... you haven\u2019t seen anything yet. \n\n\nThe TOS are sketchy and a point of concern but there are two things to keep in mind- It was necessary to word it that way, and the market clearly doesn\u2019t care. \n\n\nIf they had worded it that they will redeem no matter what, they would have money launderers flocking to the service (bogging down resources), plus law enforcement knocking. \n\n\nTethers weren\u2019t created to get $ in/out of crypto but to provide a safe haven and liquidity on exchanges that don\u2019t use USD. And I would say they are working perfectly. Very few are withdrawing USDT for USD. \n\n\nI think it is precisely because of what the co-founder of tether refers to here (and below)\u2026 \u201cIf you want to convert USD\u20ae into fiat currency (or vice-versa) at tether.to, you must go through the whole \u201caggressive\u201d KYC/AML process and get verified. I\u2019ve heard from many who tried and were unable to provide sufficient documentation. Tether\u2019s KYC/AML policies were written by experienced compliance officers and it\u2019s critical that it be done properly and with diligence. It really is about \u201cknowing your customer\u201d and making sure that their uses are legitimate.\u201d  This is a perfectly reasonable explanation why people are not lining up to cash out of Tether, and also why large/reputable institutions can (exchanges, investors, etc.).\n\n\n \n\nTETHERS REPLY TO ALL THIS, PLUS UPCOMING AUDIT\nhttps://tether.to/tether-update/\n\n\nNow ask yourself this, would a company that is operating fraudulently have a roadmap of all these new features that no one will ever use if they don\u2019t provide these promised audits as they say they will by the end of the year?\n\n\nSo as of now they have enough runway until the end of the year. I say we give Tether/Finex the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\nWhile Tether could be operating fractionally (so to could any exchange in crypto btw), there is no proof or evidence of it today. It trades at normalized rates. You can\u2019t just create 100\u2019s of million of dollars without the marketing realizing somewhere.\n\n\nSure, you can say this is a confidence game, but so is crypto, so is the USD, so is the concept of money. I see no reason to be more concerned with this risk than the already risky environment we trade in with exchanges.\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IF I\u201dM WRONG? CRYPTO WILL IMPLODE!\n\n\nNo it won\u2019t. Sure there will be a dip maybe even a correction, but there are only 395 million Tethers. People will get out of Tether even at massive discounts (until $0) into crypto because they can\u2019t get USD, but not more than the 395 million tethers circulating (at this time). \n\n\nAt a certain discount people will understand what is going on and stop trading for Tether. BTC + ETH is worth over $100 billion, how many time does the entire amount of USDT have to turn over to cause a massive crash?  \n\n\nWhat will get hit the hardest are the people left holding tether (if/when they implode) and Trex/Polo/Finex. \n\n\nTo think Polo/Trex would rely so much on USDT that they didn\u2019t fully vet it is absurd as well. Whats more likely, Polo/Trex\u2019s due diligence or this @Bitfinexed person based on conjecture?\n\n\nI\u2019ve already seen a Forbes contributor try and get ahold of Bitfinexed on twitter. https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/894437272241569792  \n\n\nCould I be wrong about all of this??? Of course, but, I feel I have provided more evidence than the other side. You are the Judge :)\n\n\n\n\nUSEFUL INFO\n\n\nSome from u/udecker - Tether co-founder\n\n\nTether.to is who has the backing for the token, not Bitfinex. Bitfinex is a customer of Tether. If Bitfinex wants more Tether, they make a request to Tether, just like all other Tether customers. Tether waits for USD to show up, and when it does, creates the necessary tethers and credits Bitfinex. They both have Tawainese banking so money can flow back and forth easily. (The banking industry in the country of Taiwan are under scrutiny lately because of larger legal issues not involving crypto, but clearly affecting crypto companies)\n\n\nhttps://wallet.tether.to/transparency\n\n\nTether wasn\u2019t designed to be a profit machine. It was designed to be a utility for the crypto community to provide a stable token (with all the benefits of this).\nTether\u2019s business model is this:\n1. Generate fees from wire deposits and withdrawals and conversions.\n2. Interest income on the reserve.\n\n\nBitfinex\u2019s parent company owns a 20% stake in Tether.\n\n\nPeople say Tether isn\u2019t being burned. But they are being recycled which is/was always an option.\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope we can have a productive conversation around this without the usual Gox 2.0, sell it all, Bitfinex is the anti-christ comments with no substance.\nGive us your opinion and perspective because maybe I am missing something\u2026 but, maybe you are too.\n\n\n\nThis was quite time consuming (just ask my kids and boss, lol) So if you found this info helpful you can donate if you\u2019d like here, if not, no biggie smalls :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBTC -  14Wz4SCuKwa81UBh1U7mcaCTxMsYLLuGZK\n\n\n\n\n\nBCH-  16uby9gW79tjn5guQG8v5mTsdu6V6cYyKF\n\n\n\nETH -  0x0181D1C82229BAD741BB6c302ae523aE6DC9a1EE",

I will update this list based on your experience and feedback, trying to present a fair view of each option.\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nhttps://www.coinclerk.com\n\n\n**PRO:** One-stop solution to buy a researched and diversified crypto portfolio without several exchanges and wallets. Also low fees from what I've heard.\n\n**CON:** In closed beta right now and will launch by invitation only to ensure service quality. (Saw the platform at an event a few weeks ago and would really love to get in.)\n\n\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nhttps://poloniex.com\n\n\n\n\n**PRO:** Fast trades, offers coins some other exchanges don't.\n\n\n\n**CON:** Unavailable balances (e.g. right now STORJ), can be expensive, very bad customer service (unanswered tickets). Lots of community distrust.\n\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nhttps://bittrex.com\n\n\n**PRO:** Fast trades, offers coins some other exchanges don't. Customer service replies but it takes quite some time.\n\n**CON:** Some downtime recently and login issues reported. \n\n--------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.gdax.com\n\n\n\n\n**PRO:** Professional setup for trading, pretty easy to use.\n\n**CON:** Verification can take long, owned by CoinBase (dealbreaker for some).\n\n--------------------\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.coinbase.com\n\n\n\n**PRO:** Good user interface and easy purchases. Instant buy options with certain debit cards. Initially starts at $500 USD instant buy limit, after 30 days it goes up to $2000 USD.\n\n\n\n**CON:** Slow, lots of downtime recently,  only offers 3 coins. Not sure if it's a Coinbase issue or bank issue, but there may be unsuccessful deposits even if debit card is verified and used previously. There have been other users/reddit posts about this.\n\n\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nhttps://www.kraken.com\n\n\n**PRO:**  Pretty good community rep (some complaints), interface works well.\n\n**CON:** I read about withdrawal issues, which makes me nervous. Also, support totally overloaded, it can take weeks or months to get help, that sucks.\n\n--------------------\n\n\nhttps://www.bitfinex.com\n\n\n**PRO:** Leveraged trading options (I wouldn't recommend touching that, but there you go). Good volume.\n\n**CON:** Customer support not great at times, had at least one hack I've heard of where they socialized the losses to all users, boo. Fees are mediocre.\n\n--------------------\n\nhttps://gemini.com\n\n**PRO:** Ability to purchase crypto before full completion of bank deposit/wire. Once Gemini gets enough information on the desposit/wire you can buy cryptocoin but there's just a temporary hold on that amount for withdraw. This really helps if you're trying to buy the coin quick.\n\n\n**CON:** Only has BTC & ETH. Only USD deposits.  Some comments below say that accounts have been locked and funds are locked, not good if true.\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\n\n**Now:**\n\nOver to you: What platforms do you recommend or dislike and why? Please share and I'll add them above as a resource for all of us.\n\n\n\nedit: typo\n\n\nedit 2: added some feedback from you guys, will add more in a bit\n\nedit 3: added Gemini based on /u/liemle82 feedback, thanks\n\nedit 4: added more PROS/CONS for coinbase from /u/liemle82 - awesome!\n\nedit 5: received many notes about issus with Gemini, e.g. from /u/the-d0c-is-in below, added comment above\n\n\n\n",

            "text": "**Preface:** I've made this post in /r/CryptoCurrency and will sprinkle it around as many places as I can to be as visible as possible. With more people entering the crypto space every day I have a responsibility to not be too quiet about it. My whole journey started on reddit, so please do me a favour and read it if for nothing else than to just educate yourself.\n\nPlease be polite because this is brand new, and I'm still dealing with it.\n\n\\------\n\nSo, fanciful title aside, I don't really have much of an agenda going into this other than writing down the experience I've had over the last few weeks in one take and hoping it has the impact that I'm aiming it to. For me, this is some level of catharsis because I'm still dealing with my distorted sense of self - and journaling it, even in these first few sentences, is the calm my mind has needed for a while, if for nothing else just to heal.\n\n^(TL;DR - Bought crypto, made gains, moved to Binance, found futures - fucked mine.)\n\n**A note**:  \nCrypto is not foreign to me. While I may have been a new entrant in the 2021 market, I'm a software engineer by trade and have been aware of it since the very early days of Bitcoin. My first buy-in was back in 2017, and we all know how that went, so I've been nothing but cautious ever since. I knew the risks, I never put in more than I could afford, and I knew that if I just kept holding, it would usually (not always) come back around. None of these points were lost on me.\n\n**If you have had any previous trouble with addictions, even something as small as food, cigarettes, or alcohol, please read my story and take this as an extremely important lesson. I'll survive this, but I'm absolutely certain there's plenty more who can't, or won't, especially coming into a bullish alt season. If this post has any goal, it's to minimise the possibility of that happening, and keep any losses contained to a balance sheet.**\n\n*If you are an influencer or celebrity of any type, please make it very clear that when you're promoting cryptocurrency as an investment, there is quite a real possibility that people can slide into trading and by extension gambling. Some will lose their money, some will lose their sense of self, others will lose their lives. You have a responsibility to inform people of these risks when promoting them.*\n\n*I know that Elon frequents reddit, so please, just, take heed of this and don't let anyone find themselves where I did. Be more candid, it could make all of the difference.*\n\n# Me, a brief history\n\nAs stated, I'm a software engineer in his 30's that's worked hard to make sure I pulled myself out of a crappy childhood into the kind of life that I wished I was a part of when I was younger. I've got a house, a couple of kids, a wife, a dog - just all the trimmings that give you that general sense of completeness.\n\nThat doesn't mean I'm not without my flaws. For as long as I can remember I've battled an addictive personality on account of ADHD and other issues caused by a wide array of formative experiences. Alcohol, cigarettes, (soft) drugs, gambling, food, romantic escapades, and other thrill seeking behaviour was an every day occurrence for me when younger, ultimately causing me more harm than good.\n\nSince those days I've worked very hard to shut off that part of my life - seeking treatment and overcoming it. This is important to note, because I'm completely aware of the dangers associated with any of these behaviours, and I steer clear of any situation that may present itself that will push me back in front of that metaphoric freight train.\n\n# Enter, 2021\n\nI've had a decent 2020. Things went pretty bad during the first half, but I was able to really grind through the second half of the year and make sure that things were back on track and everyone in my life was looked after. I entered 2021 with a renewed sense of optimism and a great situation behind me, I'd really set the bar pretty high for what was to come, and there was no way I was going to let anything stand in my way.\n\nIn the midst of all of this, I'm a redditor. Have been for near-on a decade now (I change accounts frequently), and I like to spend a little (lot) of each day scrolling through and catching up on what's happening in the world, what's funny, and just engage in a bit of conversation or crack a few jokes.\n\nSo a few weeks ago we're all aware that WSB hit all time popularity due to the GME saga. It was thrilling, it was sticking it to wall street, it was everything that you love to see on the internet and a movement you could absolutely be a part of. Because of that, I bought my tickets - a couple of shares in GME. The excitement was off the charts, and I ultimately lost about a thousand bucks, but it was absolutely worth the price of admission. I feel like I'd made an actual impact and done something useful.\n\nOff the back of that movement (I'm sure you already know where I'm going with this), Dogecoin was propelled back into the spotlight and I thought yeah, you know what, Elon is talking about it, everyone's hyped about it, I'll YOLO a bit of money at it and see how it goes. At worst I have a bag of Doge, right? I can still use it, it's another little bit of fun to be had, and it'll scratch that crypto itch that I've been ignoring since the ring sting of 2017. Only this time I wont be making the same mistakes, or so I thought.\n\n# Gains gains gains!\n\nSo, Doge went nuts. I made about 3-4x what I initially threw in and once it started to stagnate I liquidated my position (only about 1.5x by that point) back into cash and thought okay, I've got some money in my wallet and a crypto journey I want to start. Let's get into it. So I did my research, found a few coins that I thought were really promising, and started buying them up.\n\nProblem is, a lot of the coins I wanted to purchase weren't available on the exchange that I was using. So with a bit of googling I found that Binance was likely the best place for me to be able to buy the coins that I'd decided I was going to put my money into. I signed up, transferred my funds, and started figuring out the interface. Being in the industry I love to poke around and see what it's made of, which is when I made the one discovery I'll live to regret: *futures trading*.\n\nYou see, for the uninitiated: futures trading is gambling. There's no real other way to cut it, but it's gambling. You're risking what you have by borrowing what you don't in the pursuit of earning a multiplier rather than just purchasing an asset, so the risk is off the charts. Being that I'd had no stock market experience and had no idea what it was, I thought it really was just a neat trading tool. I had a play around with it and instantly I was hooked. I had no idea how anybody could lose using this. It made me feel like the most badass trader around - sitting in front of my high-tech console with all my graphs, making longs and shorts, green indicators everywhere, it was an absolute wonder.\n\n# Knowing the market, trusting what you see\n\nThis was mistake #2. This sub, a few other subs, and social media are absolutely flooded with gains porn, advice on the market, information on what to invest in, and when to invest it. A lot of it is super helpful advice and if you're well versed in the internet it's easy enough to filter out the shills and make your own decision after researching what you've read.\n\nProblem is that I had no idea the market conditions and how that can really influence your investment, especially if futures trading. I knew that there could be a bullish or bearish market, what each of those things meant, and I knew that it would go up and down, so look out for certain things on graphs and other indicators.\n\nOne thing I didn't know much about is liquidation prices, margins, and how much things could go south by something as small as BTC rallying (turns out alts get hit pretty hard), new money flooding the market, whales putting up price walls and manipulating buys/sells, and just how fast all of those things could destroy my position.\n\n# The loss of it all\n\nWhen you get addicted to something, all of the dopamine in your brain is telling you to do it again, do it more, take more risk, and everything else that you know not to be true - it's just true in that moment. Because the market was doing so well I was duped into thinking that *I* was doing well, that *I* was some masterful trader and had it all figured out, and I started to increase those positions and decrease margins, because the gains were even bigger that way. By this point, I had enough balance to cover what I put into coins originally + what I wasted on the WSB fiasco. That was absolutely perfect and I was going to take it out and put it back in the family bank, but I wanted to make another trade, just *one* more. This coin I'm confident about is breaking out and I want to at least walk away with some profit after all was said and done.\n\nWell, that was the moment I learned that things can take a turn very quickly, and a liquidation event won't just ***reduce*** your position, it will completely wipe anything you have left + the margins. I locked my phone, attended to something around the house, opened my phone to look again, and there it was:\n\nNothing.\n\nNo trade, no balance, just nothing. The price had dipped below the liquidation point and unbeknownst to me it was all over just like that. Now, just like I said before, I never risked or put in what I couldn't afford to lose, and it was a completely avoidable mistake had I known more about it, but that's where things really started to fuck me up.\n\n# How could I have been so stupid?\n\nThis is where it starts to take a turn, because it really starts to play on your sense of self when you make a mistake that big due to not knowing. Losing it all on a big gamble, taking a known risk, any of those things - you can handle the loss. You were prepared for it, you set yourself up for it, you made that conscious choice to put yourself out there in that way and you didn't win. It sucks, but that's okay, you can handle it.\n\nThis move wasn't that. This move was a complete and utter fuck up due to my lack of knowledge and understanding. Accidentally finding myself gambling and being unaware of it was bad enough, but losing it all like that so suddenly when I planned to dip out of the position if it went too poorly really shook me to the core. I had *plans* for that money, I was going to *do* things with that money. These are just some of thoughts that start swirling through your mind in the moment and you feel like you've deprived yourself and the people around you of that opportunity by being an idiot. But it's okay, you're not an idiot, you just made a mistake.\n\n# Let's add more money, make it all back\n\nThis is the point that I was in too deep but had no idea. By this point, about a week in, trading had completely consumed me and my days/nights/interactions with family, my relationship with friends was thinned, I was irritable, I was distracted, I was always watching the market. I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating well, all I could watch and feel were my trades. I had to baby them, otherwise they wouldn't work. I was obsessive over all my moves, all of my positions, all of my research - the works.\n\nOnly to me it had happened so gradually that I didn't even recognise that I was all the way down that hole. I didn't realise how consumed I'd become or how bad things had gotten because I'd just slowly and willingly walked into it all thinking it was completely innocent when it was anything but, so when I got to the point of losing that chunk of money, I thought I'd just made a minor mistake and because my trades were already so good, and I could make that back in a second.\n\nSo, stupidly and regretfully, I pulled a large sum of money out of my credit card and slapped it into my wallet. I was going to make back what I lost, make up for my stupid mistake, take it all out, and call it a day. I'd flown too close to the flames and I just wanted to make my exit quietly and gracefully, pretend it never happened and move on.\n\nBut it didn't happen like that.\n\n# The final moments\n\nIn order to make back what I'd lost, I retook the same position that I'd lost on in the first place. I thought it was a winning position, and honestly in the long run it really is. If I had more money, more time, and more knowledge, it would have - but I didn't have any of those things. I put the money right back in to where I made the mistake, vowing not to make it again now that I was armed with the knowledge of what to do, and started again.\n\nSo earlier in the story I talked about BTC rallying and alts dropping rapidly, then whales smelling blood in the water and forcing others to panic sell / trigger stop losses / trigger liquidations, then gobbling up all that remains on the cheap. This is the point in my story where I learned all of those things happen. In order to prevent bleeding out and dying entirely I had to keep reducing my position when possible, and topping up my margin. It went lower, so I had to weather it. I was too deep to sell my position and take the loss, I just had to make sure I didn't bleed out - it was going to swing back up, right? It always has.\n\nThat's where I was wrong. It didn't. Every time it went lower I had to sell off a portion and bolster my margins. I lost more, and more, and more, until eventually I had 1/4 of what I had left. At this point I was in too deep, so I vowed again to learn my mistakes, and use this money to slowly and incrementally make back what I'd lost that time.\n\nBut the market got worse, and I was caught completely unaware in a storm that I couldn't even comprehend. I was a man in a tin boat in the middle of a tsunami. It was all lost. That was it, it was over.\n\nOnce all was said and done, I'd lost around $20,000 USD.\n\n# The mind is more important than the pocket\n\nThis is I guess where I get to the core message, and the lesson that I want people to learn from where I'm sitting.\n\nFirst of all, losing money is bad no matter how you cut it. Some people will go into this investing way more than they can afford to lose, and some people will keep it small. Some people, like me, will small but end up losing way more than they need to. It will take a while for me to recover, but it won't ruin my life. Either way, it's a very hard lesson to learn just on that front.\n\nSecondly is your sense of self, sanity, and reality. Now to me this is the absolute most important lesson to learn of them all. You can very easily find yourself down the rabbit hole and not even know you're there, just as I did. You can be in too deep, destroying your bank balance and everyone around you, and justify it because you've so gradually moved into it that it's all part of your plan. Sort of like the frogs in a boiling pot analogy. By the time you've noticed it's always going to be way too late, and by that point the damage is near irreparable.\n\n# Where I'm at, and the future\n\nFor me this only ended within the last few days, so I'm still processing how I even found myself here, and how to move forwards. Writing this out is helpful because it's allowing me to process and learn from my own mistakes as I go along.\n\nUltimately I've cost my family a lot of money, I've cost myself some opportunities both cash-wise and coin-wise (I have a grand total of zero of the coins that I planned to keep as investments), and I'm dealing with some existential problems that have shaken me so horribly I'm in the middle of a mental breakdown. Don't get me wrong, I'm writing this all very logically and reasonably, but the amount that I'm struggling to comprehend how I ended up here, and the sheer scale of loss, is just making my question my entire self right to the core.\n\nBut that's the lesson I want people to learn. It doesn't matter so much about the money, the opportunity, or anything else that you may lose if you find yourself on the losing side of a bad situation. It's about the mental toll and how you'll react to that, how you'll see yourself, how you'll see the world around you and the pain you'll have to go through as a result of it.\n\nI'll heal. Slowly. Time will get me there, but as a part of that I want to try and limit anyone else entering this market afresh from making the same mistakes that I did. Part of that is telling my story, and the other part is hoping that we can make people more aware that futures/margin trading is gambling. If you have an addictive personality, stay away from it. If you're encouraging people to get into crypto, make sure it's known.\n\nIf I'd have known, maybe I'd be having a different time right now. But, honestly, it's hell. Through the tears, self-berating, and intrusive harmful thoughts, I just wish I could have picked it. I've been through it all before and I can avoid these situations pretty successfully, and yet it *still* caught me with my pants down. That's something that's hard to accept no matter who you are.\n\nIt can happen to you, too. No matter how smart you are, no matter what you've been through, and no matter what you know.\n\nJust, don't be me. It'll torture you forever. If nothing else let me take that one for the team.\n\nQuestions are welcome. Take care out there.",

It seems like Bittrex is trying to pull a Coinbase maneuver, where they were going to try and keep all the Bitcoin Cash (for a huge windfall profit) until a large amount of members started posting and threatening lawsuits. They are finally doing the right thing, just taking their sweet time about it. All NEO owners who had or still have your NEO on Bittrex need to start blasting them on every social media platform in the crypto space to get them to do the right thing. This is stealing your money and mine. I've already sent messages to Bittrex support and will continue to do so. Good luck to everyone in this same situation.",

            "text": "Hey everyone, for the past couple months I have been working on a project called [Coinmunity](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coinmunity-bitcoin-altcoin-app/id1322869245?mt=8). Coinmunity is an app that focuses on the growth of crypto communities, which in the market right now, has so much effect in driving price changes. Each day it tracks which coins have the combined highest % of growth in their Twitter and Reddit communities combined.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nToday, Coinmunity has now been live for one month, so I thought I would share what patterns I have personally picked out, having worked on the data, and observing the rankings during development and while live.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat I have noticed is that you will see certain coins start to creep up higher and higher into the top 10 or 15 communities consistently before a price increase. The best example is TRX. You can see from this reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/7k2c4g/congrats_rtronix_you_were_the_top_growing/) that I made 27 days ago, that /r/Tron had the top community while it was still at $.01 ( and it continues to consistently be in top 10 even now.) I think most of us can agree TRX has some big issues, but the point is that it\u2019s very important to know which coins have the most eyes on them; because when people are watching a coin, they\u2019ll usually buy it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Here are the 20 coins with the most growth in their communities in the last 30 days:**\n\n[#1 TRX](/r/Tronix) -  **Price Change:** +2664.018%, **Total Social Change:**+3904.851%\n\n[#2 VEN](/r/Vechain) - **Price Change:** +709.507%, **Total Social Change:**+974.497%\n\n[#3 XVG](/r/VergeCurrency) - **Price Change:** +2005.76%, **Total Social Change:**+925.614%\n\n[#4 ADA](/r/Cardano) - **Price Change:** +467.414%, **Total Social Change:**+714.406%\n\n[#5 FUN](/r/FunFairTech) - **Price Change:** +366.608%, **Total Social Change:**+611.430%\n\n[#6 REQ](/r/RequestNetwork) - **Price Change:** +646.897%, **Total Social Change:**+607.782%\n\n[#7 BNB](/r/Binance) - **Price Change:** +546.153%, **Total Social Change:**+ 558.920%\n\n[#8 SUB](/r/SubstratumNetwork) - **Price Change:** +619.376%, **Total Social Change:**+501.659%\n\n[#9 XLM](/r/Stellar) - **Price Change:** +249.216%, **Total Social Change:**+501.642%\n\n[#10 ARN](/r/AeronAero) - **Price Change:** +1020.204%, **Total Social Change:**+469.129%\n\n[#11 ENG](/r/EnigmaCatalyst) - **Price Change:** +1162.809%, **Total Social Change:**+427.344%\n\n[#12 MANA](/r/Dencentraland) - **Price Change:** +236.856%, **Total Social Change:**+393.404%\n\n[#13 XRP](/r/Ripple) - **Price Change:** +812.067%, **Total Social Change:**+389.193%\n\n[#14 ETN](/r/Electroneum) - **Price Change:** +60.470%, **Total Social Change:**+366.755%\n\n[#15 QSP](/r/Quantstamp) - **Price Change:** +518.553%, **Total Social Change:**+346.401%\n\n[#16 SALT](/r/SaltTrader) - **Price Change:** +76.836%, **Total Social Change:**+331.701%\n\n[#17 AST](/r/AirSwap) **Price Change:** +561.384%, **Total Social Change:**+272.433%\n\n[#18 THC](/r/TheHempCoin) - **Price Change:** +711.952%, **Total Social Change:**+265.797%\n\n[#19 NULS](/r/NulsService) - **Price Change:** +587.179%, **Total Social Change:**+234.036%\n\n[#20 QASH](/r/LiquidQash) - **Price Change:** +104.2105%, **Total Social Change:**+208.4238%\n\n*Total social change => reddit and twitter growth\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt probably wouldn\u2019t be the best decision to buy a coin based off just community growth, so Coinmunity pulls each coin\u2019s full subreddit to make it easy to quickly research the coin and see if there is any upcoming big news. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Some upcoming features that we think will add value:**\n\n* Google trends\n\n* Marketcap and volume rankings\n\n* Track personal investments\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you have an android, the app is currently in development, but I have made a mobile friendly web app that is available at https://coinmunity.co! I will announce on the Coinmunity [twitter](https://twitter.com/coinmunityapp) when it is completed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs Coinmunity continues to grow, I will start to collect more and more data on social activity surrounding these coins, such as retweets,comments, upvotes, etc. One relationship that I am looking forward to explore is the amount of exchanges a coin is available on vs social growth vs price growth. I think there is a sweet-spot before a coin is widely enough available to experience huge price jumps, where it would be the best time to buy a coin. If this is something you guys are interested in please let me know and I will continue to post each month about further discoveries from the data!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Links all in one place:**\n\nITUNES:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coinmunity-bitcoin-altcoin-app/id1322869245?mt=8\n\nWEB APP:\nhttps://coinmunity.co\n\nTWITTER (will announce android release on here)\nhttps://twitter.com/coinmunityapp\n\nEMAIL:\ncoinmunityapp@gmail.com\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Edit:** If you would like to donate ETH/ERC20 token to development I would really appreciate it.

(we really mean anything, we love hearing from our community) Secondly, **we are giving away 100,000 $CDT** (we are listed on Binance, so its money in your pocket). Just answer this quiz and follow the rules;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[click here >> blox_crypto_quiz](https://blox.io/lp/blox-crypto-quiz)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**About our platform:**\n\n\nBlox is an advanced Crypto asset tracking and management platform for individuals and businesses. We allow automatic syncing of your wallets and exchange accounts with multiple portfolios for free. It helps traders to keep track on their entire balance in the most easy way.\n\nWe are available on iOS, Android and Web. You can automatically sync between the three with a single sign on - useful if you're in an office and on the go at different times.\n\nSome updates about us currently, we are growing massively and are currently recruiting for 5 positions\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[click here for our open positions](https://blox.io/careers)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Frontend Developer\n\n- Senior Backend Developer\n\n- Senior iOS Developer\n\n- QA Engineer\n\n- Senior Full Stack Developer\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis will bring our team up to **30+ people** over **3 offices** around the world, ready to tackle any issues you have.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Future plans:**\n\nOur platform and user base is growing massively on a daily basis and our B2B platform already manages over $2B from the crypto market with clients such as Civic, Aeternity, eToro, Chainlinker and more. Our aim is to get to about 10% of the market being managed under blox by end of the year (ambitious and might be too aggressive, but we are ready for the challenge). We are also starting to implement blox exclusive market data in our apps (you can see it in our explore tab in our Android app) giving our users insights they cannot have anywhere in the industry as well as our public token pages which will have more exclusive data as well in the near future.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe want YOUR feedback on our platform. The only way we can improve is with your help.\nSo, take the quiz, earn some CDT, ask us ANYTHING, and if you want to help with feedback join our social channels to be part of our great community.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRegards,\nblox team",

We faced some confusion with the old name, people were under the impression that it was associated with Dash but more importantly, we wanted to give a simple and intuitive name to match our vision and design. During our ICO we were hacked and 40K ETH were stolen. Nevertheless, all of our investors got their tokens and we made sure nobody got left behind. Moreover, we came up with a loyalty program to show our appreciation to our loyal community. Even though it was rough to push through this unfortunate incident, we came through and have an awesome working product native on iOS, Android and Web with 3 offices around the world and 30+ employees! We are here to stay and give our users the best possible experience :) Hope you join us!",

There was an attempt to use the tokens but it was unsuccessful. Regardless of the heist, we distributed all the CDT tokens to our investors and supporters, that was rough but the right, and the only unquestioned thing to do.\nEver since ETH was sent back to the company's address on two occasions, we believe that the pressure that was applied helped achieve that. We had the Israeli cybersecurity agency following it as well as private agents that kept close tabs on everything.\nWe hope that no one has to face an obstacle like that, but a word of advice, stick to your plans, build what you set on doing and don't let anything deviate you from your original plans.",

            "text": "Here are some of the August 16, 2021 updates from [Crowdsense ](https://www.crowdsense.ai/post/crypto-weekly-outlook-august-16-2021) :    \n\n\n* It was announced on Friday that Cardano (ADA) is targeting the mainnet launch of the Alonzo hard fork for September 12th. This upgrade will enable users to finally run smart contracts on the network, meaning DeFi, gaming,and NFT applications will be supported. In anticipation of the announcement, ADA breached the $2 level and hasn\u2019t fallen below since. Even with the big news, cryptocurrency betting platform Polymarket is currently assigning only 82% odds that Cardano smart contracts will be supported by October 1st, moving up just 4% from the previous week. Skepticism aside, Cardano has moved into the top four cryptocurrencies by market cap and should be watched going forward, especially after having such a major 50% over the past week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Ripple\u2019s XRP was also a major mover last week gaining north of 50%. Going forward, investors should be aware that the road to $2 is still quite steep. There are resistance levels at $1.40, $1.65, and at $1.82. Technical measures including Bollinger Bands and the RSI also suggest that XRP is overbought. Traders should tread carefully as well due to the fact that several major crypto trading venues, including Binance and Huobi, received a total of 61 million XRP tokens (worth $77M) from private wallets within the past 24 hours, with the probable intention of liquidating said tokens. On the positive side, according to Santiment, \u201cin a never seen before trend, the XRP Network was closing in on a higher daily github development rate than Bitcoin, which has rarely occurred.\u201d In fact, development activity for XRP saw all-time highs over the weekend.   \n\n* Infrastructure Bill Passage Update: The much maligned crypto tax and reporting provisions passed by the Senate last week still need to go through the House of Representatives. The House will return to session on August 23rd. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is attempting to advance both the infrastructure bill and the $3.5 trillion spending package together, however, a number of moderate Democrats have said they would not support the spending package until the infrastructure bill gets approved, whereas a number of progressive lawmakers are saying the spending package must go first even though it likely won\u2019t be ready until the fall. Until some compromise is agreed upon, it\u2019s likely the infrastructure bill could languish for weeks if not months. A small number of House representatives from both parties have said the crypto language needs to be changed, but many Democrats are reluctant to change the bill in any way because doing so would return the bill to the Senate, where it could face additional challenges.  \n\n* Is Dogecoin back? DOGE gained 34% over the past week and even broke the $0.30 level. The meme coin undoubtedly benefits when there\u2019s bullish momentum in the crypto market overall and Mark Cuban\u2019s recent comments that Dogecoin is the \u201cstrongest cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange\u201d surely helped push it higher. Not to mention the fact that Elon Musk tweeted his agreement. Another billionaire aggressively promoting the benefits of Dogecoin definitely adds to its story.",

However, just when I think I know whats going on, I don't. \n\nOne thing I understand. \n\n- market dips after bad news. \n\nI get it. People get serious FUD , and as patient as I like to think I am, I fall victim to it sometimes as well.\n\nWhat I don't understand is why the market fluctuates so much , and takes dips when there is nothing but good news being spread. \n\n- Reputable companies popping up everywhere adopting crypto\n\n- all good news about ripple\n\n- Japan and Australia embracing crypto.\n\n- Yahoo adding crypto market watch \n\n- people popping up everywhere wanting to get in. \n\n- its now easier than ever to buy crypto with fiat.\n\nThe market dips with this news.  I get the whole whale theory wanting to sell off for quick profits and buy back low after causing a dip. \n\nI see subreddits super happy about a new release.  Take Bread Wallet as an example. They released a beta to buy BTC and Bread with a CC through their partner simplex, all bread owners were super happy about this,  what happens...the price takes a dip, and I didnt are any sell walls up. Volume was lower than ever. \n\nIBM to introduce steller to banks \nResult: price dips but overall market went up. \n\nLTC introduces LitePay.  Its a great feature\nResult : price creeps up normaly along with the rest of the market. No sign of great interest about this other than the social media.\n\n\nWHY????    Shouldn't the price at least pump up a little bit after this news? Even if its just a pump over hype? Or is there really that much manipulation that its gonna take a massive influx of people to overpower it? \n\nAlso, it seems,like every morning the MCAP is on a decline, and every afternoon the MCAP climbs 50billion or so only to start dipping back another 50 billion during graveyard hrs. \n\nWHY???   What am I missing here? Stocks don't act like this. Whenever some great news comes out. Este Lauder buying a big make up brand... The price shoots up. Almost every time! Even if its just temporary for a week or so. \n\nEnlighten me. ",

It needs to be digested, and often people sell immediately on the news, then buy again after a dip (because, you're right - the news is good!).",

Positive news may be ignored for a coin. But can impact later news. Depends on how traders, market makers and punters consider that coin - the more undervalued they \"feel\" it is, the more support it can achieve going upwards\n\nAlso just because a coin announces a partnership, releases a wallet, rebrands, etc **does not** automatically mean a climb. There are so many factors and variables to take into account. It can often be random.\n\nCoins also move with MCAP, which is like a tide, going in and out, varying levels as traders take profits. When all the good stuff comes together.. then we can get a massive step up like April/May 2017 or like December 2017\n\n>WHY??? What am I missing here? Stocks don't act like this. Whenever some great news comes out. Este Lauder buying a big make up brand... The price shoots up. Almost every time! Even if its just temporary for a week or so.\n\nBecause it's tangible. If you own stock in company X and there's a partnership which will equal actual measurable growth in company X, then company X's stock will grow\n\nCrypto is subtly different. It's not shares. It's associated tokens or \"currencies\". There is often no measurable advantage .. just an intangible desirability by the market for a myriad of reasons - \"good news\", FOMO, tech, random, right place at the right time, flavour of the month, etc, etc\n\ne.g. ultimately most people buy Bitcoin because they think more people will want Bitcoin in the future (short or long term), who think more people will want Bitcoin, and on and on\n\nTLDR It's as much a giant guessing/betting/gambling game on magic beads as much as it's an actual secondary market for arbitrary value on tech/concepts/teams working on specific coins/tech/ideas/companies\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They bought the stock before, because they thought there would be news that would cause the price to go up. And now that the news is released, there is no longer anything on the horizon that will make the price go up.\n\nIn the stock market, people will often keep holding after the news breaks, because good news means that the company is doing well, their fundamentals are strong, and they will continue to deliver results. Their very literal \"share\" in this company now has more value in their eyes.\n\nThe crypto market is different, because right now it's almost entirely speculative. We don't have any models for valuation, we don't even know how much of the total market cap is actual money has entered the market. People buy cryptocurrency simply because they think the price will go up. We can pretend that it's because they're planning to wait until the team builds a product that uses the token, which will increase the value of the token due to the demand that creates. But really, people are always on about \"mooning\" and what's the \"next moon\", etc.\n\nThey're looking for a future event that they believe will cause a big price jump. After that event happens, there is no longer anything in the near future that might make the price jump again. There might be something further into the future, but they'll buy the coin again when that time approaches. For now, they're looking for growth, looking for another \"moonshot\", and this coin no longer offers that. So they sell it to chase the next thing they think will skyrocket.",

Feel free to share my DD in any other subreddit or social media platform to raise awareness.\n\nKEY DETAILS: CWS/USDT ([https://www.seascape.network/](https://www.seascape.network/))\n\n**24h Trading Volume on MXC:** only 87,603 USDT\n\n**24h Trading Range:** $25-$28.267\n\n**Market Cap:** $26m (Audius was $27m when I first called them, it hit an ATH of $580m)\n\n**Investors:** Binance, LD Capital, Paka, Spark Digital Capital, Nabais Capital, M6, DU Capital, JRR Capital.\n\n**Partners:** Chainlink, Moonbeam, Opensea, Maker, Binance Smart Chain, Matic, Treasureland etc...\n\nI got in at $25 today for $25k so far invested. Seeking price target of $500 (20x on $26m mcap to $520m in less than 8 weeks). Likely they will be listed on Binance around $125m mcap or sooner. It's Alt Season now so they *may* increase quicker OR ath may be higher OR both. Remember Audius took nearly 4 weeks to double from my 22 cent call then it exploded to $4.99. Price increases are not linear.\n\nRecall, I developed a deep learning assisted bot to search the internet and work out which of these 1000s of silly coins will gain. CWS/USDT also popped up as another prime candidate gaining the traction metrics leading to organic big gains over the next few months. Add in a coordinated HODL at this volume level and you have a 20x-er. Untouched it has reached $50 by itself, **uncorrelated** generally to BTC, so its a prime alt season huge upswing candidate. Technicals also show a quick fib retracement to $50 within the next 2 weeks or sooner with good buying activity. No one was keeping track of what I said with Audius, this time, it may be different?\n\n**Special Considerations:** Becoming the STEAM game distribution platform for DeFi is a much more realistic proposition than becoming a massive AAA-game developer such as the Activision of DeFi, we are years away from seeing anything like that. I've overseen game production in my past and it's a tough business! Delays happen all the time, and its ends up being expensive and taking much longer than anticipated (even if you x2 or x3 your most conservative time length expectations). Mu**ch better to be the picker and chooser of great games.** I also have contacts at Supercell (who made the great Clash of Clans) and I will hook these guys up. I spent the last few days talking to the founder of Seascape and drilled him for information and believe they are on the right track.\n\nLike Audius, this is a coin with a website that the GENERAL PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND with a product that can be used now, granted they only have a few games, they are developing their blockchain to make it very cost effective and scalable for much bigger game titles to use them as their **in-game coin economy** partner, even if they have better distribution than seascape now. Seascape is an **in-game economy technology partner first and foremost. They are doing the hard stuff, unlike Ultra, so that they later this year become the distribution partner of choice for DeFi game titles.** Ultra is just steam with tokens and they are already around $250m market cap right now, so you see, Seascape could blow them out of the water!\n\n**SEE BELOW FOR COMPETITOR ANALYSIS for when Seascape was JUST $528k mcap** at a $10m private investor valuation (when they first listed - they caught up to that private investor valuation within weeks and that was picked up by my crypto bot - very sorry for the few weeks lag, my bot still needs to crunch data, still working out how to find gems right when they first list but that's an extremely hard thing to do!!)\n\nHowever, as with Audius, I hope another 20x is good enough, BUT I picked this up much sooner than Audius after listing so 30x is my hopium target although I don't want to be too bold. I am seeking $750 take profit if this one keeps rising strongly after surpassing $500.\n\n[Long-term hodler for sure...](https://preview.redd.it/x4rx0hs6rfs61.jpg?width=1112&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31a6aa7676e12efee27f9323103c80bc14074260)\n\nNFTs: 25,000 NFTs minted on BSC and millions of dollars dropped to users through their LP mining game. Increase in its NFT economy alone could add an extra $50m-$100m to its mcap over the next few months.\n\nWhitepaper: [https://f2be4719-641d-430b-92d5-747132d8c9bd.filesusr.com/ugd/061436\\_2d3e0cc2c8cc41a0a42e3cc2d57c7e3e.pdf](https://f2be4719-641d-430b-92d5-747132d8c9bd.filesusr.com/ugd/061436_2d3e0cc2c8cc41a0a42e3cc2d57c7e3e.pdf)\n\n**Remember**: this is a Reddit post, it is NOT financial advice, dispense your loads where ever you wish after doing your own DD and research and maybe throwing a dart at a wall. YOLO. I'm packing up to Mars. Audius already got us to the Moon! (x20 on x20 is x400).\n\n**Notes:**\n\npCWS is the bridged version of CWS (the currency of Seascape on ETH) on BSC (Binance Smart Chain). Users can bridge from ETH to BSC using poly.network bridge. 1 CWS = 1 pCWS as they are completely interchangeable. Here's a walk-through of Polybridge: [https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1](https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1)\n\n**Investors Verification:**\n\n1.

[https://jrr.group/](https://jrr.group/)\n\n**High number of coins in a few wallets:** Audius had a similar position where 84% of coins were held in 2 wallets. Seascape's token release schedule is structured to cause growth in their ecosystem and corresponding growth in their price to mitigate future inflation effects. Essentially new games will be backed by newly released CWS acting as collateral for newly minted game coin economies generated on the Seascape blockchain. This means, as a new game grows its user base and its in game economy grows in value, those additionally released CWS should in effect pay for themselves mitigating inflation effects. Interestingly, Audius had a similar reason for releasing new coins, i.e. to attract new artists, and it grew from $27m mcap to an ath of $580m.",

            "text": "After noobish start in June and a lot of learning from my own mistakes I can give you some advises how to start, how to save some money and tips if you want to trade\n\n**Choosing the project**\n\nFind a project that you really believe it will rise in the long term. Check out the market cap, the project team, roadmap, current state of the development, and worth of the market they are trying to cover. What are the problems they are trying to solve, and who are the competitors. Doing proper research will make you feel more confident when holding. Check also if the coin has fixes total supply and what percentage of the total supply is in circulation to predict future inflation. You can find a lot of useful information about the coin on https://coinmarketcap.com/ . If you click on your desired coin under tab/markets you can see list alt-exchanges where you can buy it. Another useful website is http://coinmarketcal.com/ where you can find dates of interest for various coins.\n\n**Procedure for buying**\n\nMost of the alt coins are trading on exchanges with altcoin ->BTC/ETH pairs. So first you need to obtain BTC or ETH. Coinbase is the most popular choice for that purpose but I would suggest you https://www.bitstamp.net since they have lower fees (0.25% compared to 1.5%). Another option to lower down fees is to use GDAX on Coinbase. With GDAX, if you're \"taking\" an order (meaning filling an existing order in the order book), the fee is  0.25% for Bitcoin and 0.30% for Ethereum. However, maker fees (meaning placing a limit order on the order book that may or may not be filled) are 0.\n\nAfter you bought BTC you can transfer it into BTC wallet on alt exchanges and start trading. Some of the popular alt exchanges are Binance, Bittrex, Bitfinex, etc. I prefer binance since they have the lowest fees (0.1% compared to 0.25%/0.2%). I also grew quite fond of their user interface. Check out advanced mode.\nYou can use this referral link if you like https://www.binance.com/?ref=10196951\nI would also recommend to use 2step verification for logging in.\n\n**Tips**\n\nDon't buy at all-time high if the price was rising too suddenly. I usually search for the dip for the coins that I believe in long term. Rule of thumb: all cryptos are pretty much influenced by BTC. When BTC rises suddenly most of them fall. When BTC falls down suddenly most of the cryptos fall. When BTC is stagnant or has a slow steady rise, alt coin flourish. And last, remember to take part of your profits when it's skyrocketing. Usually, there is a correction after sudden increase. Just holding, without taking the profit is still haunting me with my NEO (Antshares). It's always good to take profit to increase your stack. Have fun and good luck trading/investing!",

            "text": "*Bitcoin is looking both technically and fundamentally strong after its six-month correction, as the Halvening approaches. The last leg up in 2019 saw altcoins brutally sold off as traders positioned for BTC\u2019s parabolic move. This time, the alts are showing some signs of rising with the tide. With prices still near the bottom after a brutal crypto winter, we look at five altcoin projects we view as interesting \u2013 and potentially significantly undervalued.*\n\n[**1) Waves**](https://wavesplatform.com/)\n\nWaves Platform launched with great fanfare back in 2016 after raising 30,000 BTC. Since then the team have diligently \u2013 but relatively quietly \u2013 worked away on a host of DeFi features. Waves is now an extensive and powerful ecosystem that includes user-friendly mobile and desktop wallets; easy token creation; a decentralised exchange that combines speed, security and privacy; safe and accessible smart contracts; an algorithmically-backed stablecoin, Neutrino; and many other products and services. It contains everything needed to launch scalable dApps, and the LPoS network and community-run monetary policy provide a great way to earn on your holdings. With its core tech in place, Waves is now looking to expand globally. Neutrino dollars (USDN) are very promising: there is huge demand for stablecoins (Total Value Locked for the Maker Protocol alone is $600 million), and TVL for Neutrino is almost $4 million after just a few weeks of operation. It\u2019s growing fast, and the more WAVES are locked to generate USDN, the more net demand there will be on the market. Add to that the fact that Waves\u2019 corporate arm, Waves Enterprise, has already established some impressive industry partnerships \u2013 if the same success follows for the open Waves platform, it\u2019s going to start looking very underpriced.\n\n[**2) Ergo**](https://ergoplatform.org/en/)\n\nIn terms of fundamentals, it\u2019s hard to find a coin stronger than Ergo. Ergo has taken a different approach to smart contracts and DeFi, using Sigma protocols to enable use cases that are either impossible or risky on other platforms. Sigma protocols allow for very flexible and elegant coding of functionality, enabling developers to implement dApps that would be very expensive or horribly messy on Ethereum. Think of it like this: it\u2019s possible to build a rudimentary jet engine with junk from your garage. But it wouldn\u2019t be efficient or safe, because you don\u2019t have the right tools or materials. With Ergo, you do. Ergo\u2019s team have been involved with several other crypto platforms, and have drawn on this experience to create something unique. The issue \u2013 and the opportunity \u2013 is that they\u2019ve focused on development and not marketing. It\u2019s not easy to mine and beginners will be better off with the lite wallets rather than running a full node. This is now changing. The first mining pools are coming, and at a $5 million market cap, Ergo could easily outperform many other alts in the short-to-medium term.\n\n[**3) MakerDAO**](https://makerdao.com/en/)\n\nWith a half-billion-dollar market cap, this is by far the largest project on the list. But it\u2019s an excellent one, and given the interest in DeFi \u2013 in which Maker is a leader \u2013 it\u2019s likely undervalued. Maker\u2019s strength comes from several sources. A very solid economic model, a highly professional development and marketing team, and full decentralisation. MakerDAO, for those who don\u2019t know, is the protocol that underpins the Dai stablecoin, which is backed by crypto collateral and smart contract-enforced algorithms. There are no middlemen at all. Best of all, every time users issue Dai against ETH and other collateral, they start accruing fees \u2013 some of which is used to buy and burn MKR. $600 billion is currently locked in Maker Vaults and DeFi is growing fast, so you can see where this is going.\n\n[**4) Beam**](https://beam.mw/)\n\nAlong with Grin, Beam is one of two very exciting projects based on Mimblewimble \u2013 an impressive new privacy protocol that offers significant advantages over existing approaches. While coins like Dash and Monero seek to obscure the flow of money on the blockchain, Mimblewimble enables users to avoid putting critical information on the blockchain in the first place. That makes it both more private and scalable. Of the two, we\u2019ve chosen Beam because it has a well-funded development team and limited coin supply \u2013 plus it\u2019s just passed its first halving, so there\u2019s a good chance the reduced block rewards will have an effect on price in the coming months. At $40 million market cap, it has a long way to go.\n\n[**5) Sentinel**](https://sentinel.co/)\n\nSentinel is another micro-cap ($3 million) and another privacy project, but this one\u2019s a dVPN \u2013 decentralised Virtual Private Network provider. Sentinel Network is a decentralised VPN that cryptographically guarantees the safety of your personal information, maintained by a collection of nodes around the world. It\u2019s built on Tendermint, which is a solid technical choice. We\u2019re interested because it\u2019s tiny, but there are a lot of people who use VPNs. A lot. And after a spate of VPN hacks (including NordVPN), a large proportion of those users must be wondering how safe their \u2018private\u2019 data really is when surfing the web\u2026\n\nThese are just five of the many, many interesting and attractive altcoin projects out there \u2013 we couldn\u2019t include all the ones we\u2019d want in our portfolio. Are you involved with any of these five? Are there others you think should be on the list? Retweet and let us know why!  \n\\#uncutgems",

            "text": "After recently opening for public trading, the SafeFairMoon project is reported to have completed their planned overhaul of the intial branding and use case. On their social media channels and new website they proclaim their mission as centering around a bug-fixed, rug-free deflationary autostaking contract as a use-case token for offering professional contract auditing services on the Binance Smart Chain\n\nFew heads were turned upon the launch of the new website - until the team dropped a bomb in the world of BSC crypto in the form of the the report \"Exposing Suspicious Transaction Activity in FAIRMOON Token\", detailing a sell-off totaling a value of 1.8 million USD from a network of wallets traceable to the tokens dev team.\n\nThe token itself belongs to the category of a low mcap project with room for growth, with barely 2,000 wallets holding the token as this is being written. Interestingly, the newly released roadmap reveals plan for a fully independent auditioning platform, with automatization coming in the future. Following on their muckraking on the Fairmoon affair, it is also to find a point about \"conducting a lottery for ex-fairmoon holders\".\n\nWe all know that crypto space can be both stressful and scary, and investing in even a project that might seem to have the future for it such as SFM cannot be said to be \"guaranteed 100X\" or \"easy money\". DYOR and invest according to sound mind, not FOMO.\n\nAs for the arguments for the need of their product, the SFM website has this to say:\n\n>SafeFairMoon is here to help guide the next generation of crypto enthusiasts in the right directionAs the market booms, many new tokens have popped up on the scene. While we believe everyone should have the right to create, buy, and sell any token they like, we also believe it is important to do so safely. As crypto has grown, many new investors and developers have entered the space with a lack of knowledge about what makes a smart contract safe.As was the case with fairmoon, bad contract code can be a nightmare for buyers. Although the fairmoon contract was audited by one of the most well known auditors in the space, both the auditors and developers missed a key error within the code.The fact that this happened speaks to how early we are in crypto and how much more room there is to grow and make this space safer for new investors.We believe our services will play a key role in pushing the next generation of crypto forward and ensuring buyers and developers can stay safe.",

It combines the block-lattice architecture that was first(?) used by Raiblocks/Nano with a DAG that exists as a separate layer for the consensus. The block-lattice handles the transactions. It's going to be used to scale Web3 dapps as a L1, and also process transactions as a L2 chain.\n\nWho does it: This is an independent, open-source project and will probably be run by a foundation similar to Ethereum and Cardano, but I'm about 99.5% sure its backed by Square. I can enumerate the zillions of times they have hinted as such if I really have to here, but you can search for old biz posts on Zenon here and also on Warosu.\n\nSquare will likely use it to scale Bitcoin transactions where the default payment for merchants and Cashapp users is made in BTC, and then they can set it to dollars or pounds or whatever afterwards.\n\nIts open source and not owned by Square, like how Node.js isn't owned by Google but has wide adoption. They'll easily recruit 1000s of legacy web apps for this bc no code changes are needed, and also dapps on Ethereum will easily switch over.\n\nWith the recent hype for Layer-1s one should definitely look into Zenon Network if L1s are of interest. One of the bigger cryptonews site covered it here. https://cryptocurrenciesnews.co.uk/fundamental-analysis-of-a-professional-low-cap-crypto-investor-applied-to-zenon-network/",

It\u2019s easy, you save on fees, and as long as you stick to large, trusted exchanges (Basically, the exchanges that are a year old and have fiat gateways). Binance, Coinbase, Gemini, Bitpanda etc are all perfectly safe unless something REALLY unlikely happens.\n\nHowever, if you are holding greater amounts, then indeed you should probably take your coins out. If you want to try out transacting a bit, you might look into Electrum, which is probably the default wallet for BTC and its forks, and pretty old. Metamask is similarly great for ETH.\n\nIf your plan is to hold for the long term, there are some new options you probably didn\u2019t hear about while you took a break from crypto. [Amon.tech](https://amon.tech/) offers an interesting solution where you can actually earn interest on your coins.",

            "text": "Hi fellow crypto traders/miners.\n\nYesterday I read something about a coin named mintcoin.\nActually it was on this subreddit.\nI googled it and did not even find the website of this coin, neither did i find any information about it.\n\n\nSo I did a little bit of research and here is what i've found:\n\nMintcoin was launched on febuary 6th and is a coin with Proof of Work distribution and Proof of Stake security.\nSo what does this mean. This means that in the first 5 weeks most of the coins get mined through Proof of Work, as you know it.\nAfter every week of this phase the block reward halves and less coins get distributed.\nAfter 5 weeks, the PoW payout will be fixed at 1 coin per block.\n\n\n\n**But how do we secure the network you might ask?**\n\nThis is when Proof of Stake comes to play. I quote wikipedia:\n> When generating a proof-of-stake block, the user sends some money to themselves, consuming their coin age in exchange for a preset reward. This minting transaction becomes more likely to succeed over time until a valid block is found, generating a new block on the blockchain and a payout for the proving user. This process secures the network and gradually produces new coins over time without consuming significant computational power.\n\n[Wiki: Proof of Stake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake)\n\n\nSo essentially what will happen is that the coins network security in five weaks will move from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake.\n\n\n**So whats the big deal about it?**\nMany coins get created these days and some of them, for example vertcoin, are said to be the successor of maybe litecoin, because they are ASIC-blocking.\nMintcoin will also be ASIC-blocking because it will not make any sense in three weeks to mine it with hardware. All you need to do is buy some mintcoins, store them in your wallet and leave it there. Now here is the thing.\n\nThe longer your coins are unspent, the more powerful your stake will be, so you as an investor will help securing the network by actually be doing nothing :D\nThe best thing about it: As any miner you will be rewarded by securing the network.\n\nI quote the official bitcointalk thread:\n> MintCoin also adopt a variable PoS rate, which gives the highest payout at 20% the first year, then decrease 5% per year until the 4th year it reaches annual interest rate of 5%, then it will remain at this rate. \n\nOf course you will not need to wait a full year to receive a 20% return by mining the coin.\nAfter 20 mintcoin days destroyed you will get your first earnings in your wallet.\n\n\n**Where do I trade it?**\nRight now there are three exchanges trading the coin:\n\n- https://www.mintpal.com/market/MINT/BTC\n\n- https://www.newaltex.com/exchange/mint_btc\n\n- https://coin-swap.net/\n\nI can definitely recommend you mintpal.com. Its based in the UK, has an awesome coin voting feature and is fast as hell.\n\n\n**Is this the right time to get in?**\nI probably is! Right now, all coins are getting distributed. Even if you are not interested in trading your money into mintcoin, you could also mine it.\nMining right now is also pretty profitable. Even with some shitty hardware, I have a ATI HD4870 and I mined about 1500 coins in about 2 hours.\n\nJust think about it this way: The coin cost 6 satoshis right now.\nEven the shittiest coins with less then 0,5 BTC Volume a day made it to more then 100 satoshis.\nFeel free to look it up on cryptsy yourself: https://www.cryptsy.com/ .\n**Mintcoin is traded at mintpal.com at 72.926 BTC Volume.**\nSo it is most definitely the best time now to buy your coins, get active in the community and do stuff :)\n\n\n**Also, check out our very early subreddit and become part of the community: http://www.reddit.com/r/mintcoin**\n\nLinks:\n\n- https://www.mintpal.com/\n\n- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=450381.0\n\n- http://mintcoin.biz/\n\n\nPS: Feel free to correct me or ask me questions. \nAlso I should say that I'm not an expert at this coin, nor am I related in any way to the dev team of the coin. I'm just fascinated about how innovative this coin is.",

They're looking to incentivize their network and ecosystem, providing a passive income stream for holders. \n\nWhat is SYLO?\n\nSylo is an ecosystem made up of digital consumer wallet software, applications, infrastructure & developer tools to usher in a world of Smart Money. Sylo is a smart wallet application with multiple features like messaging, Crypto support, DeFi features as well as payment options.\n\nThe incentivization of the SYLO network will be in three different phases.\n\n\u2713Liquidity mining:\n\nAlso known as \u2018yield farming\u2019, this initiative incentivizes the Sylo community to provide liquidity for the Sylo Token on Uniswap V2.\n\nLiquidity mining on the decentralized exchange will come first.\n\nProvide liquidity for SYLO & ETH, and/or SYLO & WBTC on Uniswap \n\nStake your UNI\\_LP tokens in the Sylo Staking dashboard and earn rewards.\n\n\u2713SYLO node Staking:\n\nSylo Node operators will be rewarded for bootstrapping the network over a period of 100 weeks.\n\nEach epoch will pay out a fixed number of SYLO to staked nodes on the network. This is another great way to capitalize on passive income.\n\nThe more SYLO staked into your node, the more tickets will be sent your way in exchange for your contribution to the network, and the more recognition you and your delegators will receive.\n\n\u2713SYLO network services:\n\nThis service incentivization stage will overlap with the bootstrapping stage. \n\nNode operators will be eligible for bootstrapping incentives in addition to the new service incentives.\n\nAs the Sylo Network becomes populated with more Sylo Nodes, we will begin to deploy incentivized services. Nodes being operated to earn rewards will be able to replace the existing non-incentivized service protocols with incentivized services operating on the probabilistic micropayment layer.\n\nAll these are ways to earn passively and have a reason not to get frustrated by the current market conditions.\n\nSylo is a small market cap asset that I think has lots of room to grow and we could see it pulling some surprises in the future.",

That includes, processing and computation, storage, monetary transfer and a whole host of other specialized services.\n\nFind coins/tokens that are providing these services.  They'll be the ones others build on top of in the future.\n\nEthereum, Golem, Storj, Augur, Steem, Ripple and others are all great picks IMO.",

            "text": "**Preface and Disclosures:**\n\nNone of the information presented is to be taken as financial advice. I am merely a broke college student with too little time on my hand that happens to really like this coin. I personally am currently mining HNT and thus benefit from positive price movements. I am likely to be biased as I have a permanent position in the aforementioned currency and hold an optimistic (bullish) view. \n\n**What is the People\u2019s Network?**\n\nHelium, the people\u2019s network, is a low power, high range, low bandwidth, wireless network provided by individuals. The network is intended to service Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d) devices and enable real time data transfer via this network. The wireless technology used in this network is LoRaWAN, a patented low power high range radio signal technology. The network itself is provided by the people as they host hotspots from their homes, offices, or friends\u2019 homes. These hotspots provide the wireless network for others to use by sending out a wireless signal and connecting to the Helium blockchain via the internet. The incentive for hotspot owners to provide this network is that they get compensated for the use and coverage of the network in the cryptocurrency Helium Token (HNT). These hotspots are effectively miners. All current real time data relating to the network can be found on Helium\u2019s explorer page (*Helium Explorer*, 2020).\n\n**Why use The People\u2019s Network?**\n\nThe main use for the Helium network is to connect IoT devices. This already provides a wide breadth of use cases. The primary reason however is affordability and convenience. Companies that wish to use this network need not build their own infrastructure as the network is being provided by many individuals. The cost of use is a fraction of that when compared to a conventional cellular connection. Additionally, the devices themselves do not need a lot of power to stay connected to the network and eliminate the need for a sim card. Furthermore, all connections are encrypted and anonymized, and thus unlikely to be susceptible to breaches. This makes for a very attractive proposal to large businesses and startups looking to utilize the network. The low cost and lack of need for maintenance is more than compelling for any balance sheet. Even private individuals would be incentivized to use the network for their own personal solution. \n\n**What using the network means for HNT and current use cases.**\n\nCurrently, quite a few companies have signed on to use the network and quite a few startups are looking to launch their product and utilize the network. Here is a list of some of the most promising use cases with a list of companies in parenthesis:\n\n\u00b7 Asset Tracking (digital matter, Conserv, Lonestar Tracking, Lime)\n\no Asset tracking implies putting a GPS tracker that utilizes the helium network to ascertain the location of specific assets. By utilizing Helium, the trackers need less power, are cheaper to use and require no infrastructure to be set up by the utilizing company. The assets can range from micro mobility devices such as rental bikes, scooters, skateboards and others, to cars, paintings and construction vehicles (*Use The People\u2019s Network*, 2019).\n\n\u00b7 Package Tracking (Barnacle)\n\no Packages can be independently tracked from the shipping company and prevent package theft, package loss, and accurate real time tracking of packages. The receiver would gain access to a specific hash that they can use to track their package. This is intended for high value product orders. A return address is printed on the back of the tracker itself and once the package has arrived at its intended destination the customer can send the tracker back via conventional mail (Boen, 2021).\n\n\u00b7 Pet tracking (InvisiLeash)\n\no A dog or cat collar fitted with a helium tracker can allow the owner to quickly and accurately locate their lost pet. Additionally, the low power necessary means that the tracker doesn\u2019t need to be charge frequently. It can also automatically activate only once the pet has left a specified area to conserve using data credits when it isn\u2019t necessary (*Use The People\u2019s Network*, 2019).\n\n\u00b7 Vehicle and Metropolitan Uses (Nobel Systems)\n\no What if you were to need to find parking quickly and accurately in any metropolitan area? Using the Helium network, sensors by parking spaces could tell you in real time which parking spaces are free and which ones are occupied. Additionally, parking could be charged automatically (*Use The People\u2019s Network*, 2019).\n\n\u00b7 Health Monitoring (CareBand)\n\no Elderly people have quite a few challenges to face in their twilight years, especially those suffering from dementia and other memory and cognitive impairment diseases. By having them wear a bracelet that monitors their activity and if necessary, their location, loved ones can be quickly found and helped in the case of an emergency (*Use The People\u2019s Network*, 2019).\n\n\u00b7 Agricultural Monitoring (Agulus)\n\no A lot of agricultural machinery is moving in the direction of atomization. Being able to control and monitor said machinery by utilizing the Helium network would reduce costs, provide enough range to cover vast amounts of land, and instantly notify the operator if any intervention is necessary (*Use The People\u2019s Network*, 2019).\n\nThese use cases are quite promising and provide a real-world application that is useful to the consumer as well as the provider. Helium provides a robust decentralized network that is safe, cost effective and useful. Now that we have established why one would use this network, lets delve in to what happens when you do.\n\nUsers of the network need to pay for its utilization. They can do this by using Data Credits (DC). DC are created by burning the crypto token HNT. Burning means that the token is removed from the supply forever. One HNT is worth 1 million DC. Thus, the utilization of the network increases demand by reducing supply. Supply is replenished by hotspot owners and Validators that maintain and provide the network.\n\n**Tokenomics of HNT**\n\nHNT is the cryptocurrency that is mined by hotspots and validators of the network. Data Credits are used by devices to send data on the network and for transaction fees on the blockchain. They can only be obtained by burning HNT, are non-transferrable and tied to a single user. The cost of data transfer using DC is fixed and does not fluctuate with the price of HNT. However, the amount of data credits one HNT is worth does fluctuate. This is known as oracle price. The oracle price is close to the trading price but more stable and averaged out based on trading price. For example, if HNT is currently trading at 15$ and the oracle price for 1 HNT is 15.50$ then one HNT is worth 1.55 million DC. HNT has a Maximum supply of 223M HNT and the mining of the token is halved every two years on the network\u2019s genesis anniversary. The first halving is scheduled for August 1st 2021. The ultimate goal is to achieve a minting and use equilibrium. Due to HNT needing to be burned to use the network, Helium miners and validators can continue to earn rewards after the maximum supply has been mined. Additionally, a reserve pool is allocated over time. A certain percentage of newly minted HNT is kept in a reserve pool that can be used to pay out miners and validators over time after max supply has been reached guaranteeing a continued rewarding of providing network coverage. This is known as Net Emissions (*What Are Net Emissions?*, 2021).\n\n**Requirements for Mining HNT**\n\nHNT can only be mined by one of two methods. The first is by providing network coverage with a Helium hotspot, creating proof of coverage challenges, passing proof of coverage challenges, witnessing other hotspots passing proof of coverage challenges, and for transferring data. Only hotspots created by approved manufacturers are able to mine and DIY hotspots can be used as a relay to provide a larger coverage area. As previously mentioned, there is not proof-of-work hash rate or hashing like it is currently the case with ETH and BTC. The heavy lifting in terms of processing power has been moved from hotspots to Validators as of the 7th of July 2021. As an aside, Hotspots barely use any power themselves, a RAK V2 Hotspot uses an average of 12W, thus making the mining very profitable in comparison to traditional proof-of-work mining. The second method is by staking 10k HNT and becoming a validator. A validator is a server that runs the blockchain and offloads most of the processing power required for the blockchain and verifies and validates transactions and block integrity. In order for a validator to be online, 10k HNT must be staked. The current official APY for staking is 22% with the halving on August 1st taken in to consideration. Third party pool-based staking platforms may offer higher or lower returns. \n\n**Mining mechanics and mining profitability**\n\nAs mentioned previously, miners provide the network and get compensated for it. This means effectively there is no hash rate as it does not mine via a proof-of-work but via proof-of-coverage. However, there are some conditions. Every miner should be at least 300m apart from each other. Furthermore, the denser an area the more the rewards of miners are scaled down. Scaling means that hotspots that are close together will have their rewards automatically scaled down by a multiplier. For example, if there are too many hotspots in an area the mining scale might be .50 which means that every reward paid out will be multiplied by .50 and thus the reward is half of what it would normally be. Covering areas with less hotspots but enough to forge connections and witness each other is ideal. Everyone benefits from areas that are less congested. Additionally, miners need to have their location asserted during initial setup or when it is moved. This requires the owner to pay a DC fee. The location needs to be fixed and can not be mobile as that would defeat the purpose for providing coverage to a specified location. There are solutions however of having miners set up in remote fixed locations by using cellular for transmitting internet traffic and solar for power. As for profitability, at the time of writing well performing HNT miners can mine around 100HNT per month. After the halving that would be 50HNT per month. At current average trading price of 13$ that is 1300$ per month and after the halving 650$ per month. However, it is likely that the halving will increase the price as demand increases and minting has been cut in half. The initial cost for a miner and a decent antenna comes to around 400-500$ per unit. That means after the halving the ROI for a miner would be less than one month for a miner that performs very well and is in optimal conditions. Furthermore, it is worth considering getting multiple miners and setting them up in multiple locations in preferable less dense areas. Having a healthy 3km or 2-mile distance between each miner would be optimal. Each miner will mine to the same wallet address and they are capable of witnessing each other for extra payouts. The power draw being between 13W and 15W makes this a very attractive proposition as this is negligible in comparison to standard proof of work mining. The only cost consideration would be internet as a miner is known to use about 30GB of data each month which may be a factor for miners running on cellular internet connections. \n\n**Security**\n\nThe HNT wallet is currently available in two forms, the mobile app with fingerprint and other biometric unlocking methods, as well as a command line interface wallet. The CLI wallet requires more caution on behalf of the user (*Wallets | Helium Documentation*, 2019). The mobile app also uses a 14-word security pass phrase and has the option to further secure the wallet with a pin and biometric identifier. The 14 words need to be backed up and secured otherwise the wallet may be lost forever. Each wallet additionally uses asymmetric private keys. Transactions are secured by validators and are just as anonymous and encrypted as a transaction on the ETH blockchain. As for the security regarding hacking, the most common attack vector on hotspots is the only required port that needs to be open is TCP 44158. All other inbound and outbound connections can be blocked or adjusted as needed. The connection the hotspot forges however is exclusively to the blockchain and the connection from each device to the hotspot as well as hotspot to blockchain are encrypted with AES private key encryption at the chip level. Furthermore, each device communicates with the hotspot via LongFi or LoRaWAN and not IP (Internet Protocol). While inexpensive, each transaction and data transfer require DC and thus isn\u2019t free. This also serves as a deterrent for potential hacking attempts and scammers. The radio and wireless signals emitted also all comply with each region\u2019s wireless regulations regarding unlicensed frequency bands (*Security FAQ | Helium Documentation*, 2019).\n\n**Forward looking speculative outlook for HNT**\n\nAs outlined, HNT has a very strong fundamental case in terms of Tokenomics, mining and use cases. I firmly believe that there is a demand for the use cases outlined, and further use cases that are yet to be developed may completely outshine the ones on display here. Something that has not been mentioned is that there is additionally a 5G network coming to Helium. This is supposed to offload regular 5G network traffic when the cellular providers are overloaded to ensure more stable connections and less slowdowns overall. It would use DC for the data transfer costs thus reducing supply. Separate 5G miners are in production, but as of this time they do not factor in to the Helium network yet. The 5G network could however bring on millions of users helping to achieve burn and mint equilibrium faster than expected and may even outpace the minting (Haleem, 2021). As for the fair price of HNT, as of time of writing, HNT has reached an ATH of 22$ per coin and currently trades at around 13$ a coin. In my estimation based on the fundamentals outlined here, a realistic fair price of 30$ per coin is not unheard of. A speculative value of 150$ per coin post halving and increased interest in the project is realistic. This assessment is based on the fact that the market is massive if helium truly succeeds. When taking a burn to mint equilibrium in to account, the value of HNT should be 20$ per $1M DC usage. The current usage of DC on the network is $1.5M thus the assessment of 30$ (*James Fayal on*, 2021). The halving may introduce an increased interest in purchasing the coin as mining rewards will be reduced by half and thus demand will increase. Overall, fundamentally, HNT is a solid project with realistic prospects and use cases. \n\n**TL:DR**\n\nHelium is a wireless network that companies are champing at the bit to use as its cheaper than cellular. The demand for the coin will increase as more companies develop uses for it as the only way to use the network is by burning its cryptocurrency. The only way to obtain it is by buying or mining, thus the demand for HNT could skyrocket if the use cases are compelling enough. HNT go BRR in the long run.\n\n**Works Cited**\n\n*People-Powered Networks.* Helium. (2019). [https://www.helium.com/](https://www.helium.com/)  \n\n*Build The People\u2019s Network*. (2019). Helium.

            "text": "##The Problem\nThe GET Protocol is a solution to an inherent problem that we face today in the event industry. Any concert, theatre event or festival is plagued with tickets being sold second hand for ridiculous prices, resulting in the true fans having to pay anywhere from 5-20x more money for a ticket on the secondary ticketing market. This is caused by bots and professional re-selling companies who rely on the connection made by the artist and fan to gouge fans of their money, in fact many cases have been found against Ticket Master who deliberately hold back tickets from the initial sale in order to sell on their own re-selling websites. In recent occurrences we have seen Adele, Ed Sheeran & other big artists express their anger at these websites and companies, so this brings us to the question of how we can solve this issue?\n\n##Using The Blockchain To Solve The Problem\nSo lets delve into what makes the GET Protocol so good, it's being developed on top of the Ethereum blockchain and is in development by GUTS Tickets, a Dutch team based in Amsterdam. The protocol works so that once fully completed it will allow any artist to sell tickets to fans directly over the protocol & blockchain. Any fan attending an event will never realise that they hold an ethereum wallet as the team believes (and so do I) that in order to get mainstream adoption, the technical side of things should be left running in the background and the user experience should be up front. \n\nThe GUTS Application which utilises the protocol is already working and being used across 10+ theatres in the Netherlands, in fact here's a photo from one of the theatres, [none of these people know they have an ethereum wallet, they are crypto muggles!](https://imgur.com/a/ppXUvSr). As I mentioned in the title, they will have sold 1 million tickets by the end of next year, all of these tickets will be registered and have the ticket state changes on the blockchain and each and every ticket will be backed by a cryptocurrency called [GET](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/get-protocol/). The application uses several pieces of technology to prevent ticket scalping, it ties tickets to the persons mobile sim and shuffles the QR code of the ticket so that only the scanned code upon arrival at the theatre works, therefore it makes it impossible to screenshot the code or print it for re-sale. There are further technologies in play and thanks to the blockchain the venue/artist can also get real time statistics of tickets being scanned (which allows artists complete control to peak under the hood and ensure malicious practices are not in play). Here's a screenshot of the dashboard frpm one of the recent events: https://imgur.com/a/lLH1YFf\n\nThe Team have three main big artists on board from the Netherlands, Youp Van 't Hek, Jochem Myjer, Guus Meuwis (combined they have a following of over 4 million people). They all went onto Dutch Prime Time TV, De Wereld Draait Door to discuss the tech: https://vimeo.com/258953277.\n\n##Introducing GET\nSo GET is a cryptocurrency that backs each and every smart ticket starting in Q3 that is sold either on the GET Protocol or the GUTS tickets application that runs on top of the protocol. Fans never know that there is cryptocurrency or blockchain technology being used, they buy tickets via the GUTS app using FIAT which makes it so that truly anyone can utilise the technology. As an investor this makes any tickets being sold lucrative as since GET is bought off the open market by the price oracle (which buys GET from a range of exchanges at the average price per GET) the buy pressure increases as more and more events adopt the protocol and technology. We're already seeing many events getting on board and many more to come, you can see all the events already line here: https://events.guts.tickets/events\n\nAs for the token economics of GET:\n\n* 10,384,393 GET Current Circulating Supply\n\n* 13,523,852.45 GET Max Circulating Supply\n\n* \u00a35,903,246 GBP Current Market Cap\n\nRight Now GET Is Mainly Available On (Centralised Exchange Coming In The Next Two Months):\n\n* [IDEX] (https://idex.market/eth/get)\n\n* [DDEX] (https://ddex.io/trade/GET-ETH)\n\nNeedless to say that the GET Protocol is primed to blow the doors off the centralised corrupt ticketing industry, which is expected to grow to 24 Billion by 2021. The protocol could allow artists to completely change the way they sell tickets to fans, giving them ultimate control and allowing blockchain to flourish by being used in a way that truly utilises decentralisation for good.

            "text": "- At this very moment, RaiBlocks is trading at $29 down from its all time high of around $37. This means you are not even buying the top and are likely seeing the lowest entry point you will ever see again. \n\n- Bit-Z will officially be listing XRB as a tradable crypto tomorrow which coincides with the closure of the Binance poll. The winner of this poll gets listed on Binance within a week. Guess who's dominating the vote with a 2:1 ratio over second place? Yes, RaiBlocks. Bit-Z will open the door for so many investors who were afraid of putting money on the unknown exchanges of BitGrail and Mercatox. I've spoken to many people with big pockets who are waiting for this chance to buy who were unwilling to buy on the currently accepted exchanges.\n\n- Getting listed on Binance. Sure there may be an initial correction, but every coin listed has since surged to 4-5x past original price within a month.\n\n- Rebranding: A rumor which has been all but proven to be true has leaked the rebranding of RaiBlocks. This will point to RaiBlocks being renamed to \"Nano\" a much more adoptable, sleek, relevant name. This will likely be announced next week sometime based on a rough estimate of one of the developers stating that something big was going to be announced.\n\n- Along with the rebranding, the leaked site shows a beautifully redesigned website and a new wallets. Both of which (especially the wallets) always have a fantastic effect on overall price.\n\n- XRB is still not compatible with hardware wallets. This is inevitable and if renamed to Nano, the Ledger Nano S is just a perfect fit to work harmoniously with. There are so many investors out there who refuse to invest in anything they cant keep in cold storage. This will bring in a lot of new money.\n\n\nNow if you haven't forgotten, XRB is the quickest crypto on the market, has no fees, and allows for unlimited scalability. The team is brilliant and loves interacting with the community, which as a whole is my favorite I've ever been involved with.... and I've been involved in quite a few. At the end of the day, the choice is yours. However, you'd be out of your mind not to think this is AT LEAST a top 5 coin. See you in the next galaxy everyone.",

Please, critics are welcomed. Disclaimer : it's gonna be a long post.\n\n**BTC** : it was obviously my first purchase a few years ago but I have always spent it. Yes, it's been a mistake, I could have be way richer than I am today if I kept them. But it's a currency, isn't it ? \nNow, I hold most of my BTC and I do think that there's still a lot of room to grow. Segwit implementation is starting to be a success and I hope S2x won't work. Nevertheless, I still think that in order to be more adopted in the future, Bitcoin should be used as a currency and not be held forever. **Price prediction : $10K within two years (with some bumps, obviously)**\n\n**LTC** : I have always liked this fork, its quickness, its development. /u/Coblee is one of my favourite guys, I love his honesty and his humility. I think that Litecoin has a chance to be used as a currency and more merchants would be wise to accept it. **Price prediction ? 200$ within two years (with some bumps, obviously).**\n\n**VTC** : I have already made some profits with Vertcoin but I have always bought back my VTC. The community is one of the best and there's a lot of interesting techs. Even though I don't really care about ASIC-Resistance, stealth addresses are really useful. Ledger Nano S, Blue and Trezor will be able to store it, an IOS wallet and an Exchange/Wallet are on their way. Pretty cool. Still, I'd like a rebranding (in French, Vert means Green and I don't think this name helps its adoption). **Price prediction : 20-30$ within two years**\n\n**Quick thought : I don't think there will be room for these three coins in the long term (5-10 years) because they are very similar. For now, I think it's safe to bet on all of them.**\n\n**Neo/Gas** : I love the way Neo has been built and this ability to claim Gas is so easy. While I already made profits with Neo, I still think that it's slightly overpriced currently but crypto world is into speculation, right ? Anyway, Neo's leader is one of the most enthusiast and honest guys I have ever read in crypto. The future is promising and I don't think that China will be able to stop it : FUD is just FUD. There's also a connection between Loopring and Da Hongfei and I think it can't hurt for future collaborations. **Price predictions ? 70-100$ within two years.**\n\n**Qtum** : if Neo is priced like this, Qtum should be too. Just my two IOTA. I guess that the reputation of its leader played a big part in the mind of potential investors. Still, I don't like being influenced by rumors and he has already addressed this topic many times. If the team succeeds to deliver its roadmap (API release, Springmail, Qloha, oracles), then Qtum could be huge. But I do think that it's a long term project. **Price predictions ? 25-40$ within two years**. \n\n**Quick thought : pay attention that - correct me if I'm wrong - Chinese people are way more interested in Qtum than in Neo, whose community come mostly from Western territory.**\n\n**Waves Platform** : hmmm, I'm a huge fan of Waves and Sasha Ivanov. I bought my first Waves more than one year ago and I'm still accumulating (current price is a bargain). Yeah, I know that a lot of people are not fond of the current DEX but it's an alpha version. A new GUI/DEX is coming. There's already FIAT gateways, Bitcoin, ETH, LTC and Zec gateways, a pretty cool IOS wallet has just been released and the Bitcoin-NG protocol is currently on the testnet and once in the mainnet, it will make Waves faster than most of the platforms. Moreover, more and more projects are planning their ICOs on Waves because it's stable & secure. The connection with Oceanlab (a development team which is very serious and has alreadly delivered solid tools quicky after their ICO) is also promising. Ah, and the trendy buzzword 'smart contract' is also coming. Waves has always been my hidden gem. **Price predictions ? 15-70$**. It will mostly depend of users adoption. Even though I respect Ethereum a lot, I'd advise people to give a look on Waves. It's user-friendly and most of us are not coders, right ?\n\n**Navcoin** : Nav is one of my favourite coins out there. First, kudos to the community, humble, cool, genuine. About the coin itself : have you ever sent a transaction with Navcoin ? Wow, it's really, really fast. Anonymous dApps is coming and although I don't know if it will make Nav able to compete with Monero, I think it will make a lot of 'privacy' coins useless (XVG, Zcash, maybe PIVX) and it's way faster than Monero. There's already a FIAT gateway via Changelly available and the team is building a platform in order to buy Nav with FIAT, credit card, Paypal and more. If I sell Nav, it's always in order to buy back. **Price predictions : IMO, it should already be 5$ at least (it's 0.8 currently). If people wake up, 10$ within two years.**\n\n**Ark** : maybe I'm wrong, but I think that Ark is already user-friendly and that it's very important to be adopted. The dPOS protocol is really cool, even for a small holder. The Ledger wallet implementation has been done. The team will enable market fees, the voting will be cheaper. The ArkVM to allow users to make smart contracts is on its way. Overall, There's a lot of room to grow and I have never lose any money with Ark. **Price predictions ? 10-15$ within two years.**\n\n**Lisk** : I don't think I could talk about Ark without doing the same with Lisk. You all know that rebrand & SDK release are on their way. Then, the Lisk ecosystem should grow a lot. So ? I'm accumulating for the long term. **Price predictions ? 10-15$ within two years.**\n\n\n**THE DAG CRYPTO**\n\n**Byteball** : yeah, I know Byteball price is falling but like most of you, I got most of mine for free thanks to the airdrop. Finally, airdrops may have hurt the price since a lot of people dumped their bytes right away. Also, I know that a lot of people are fearful of the lack of decentralisation because most of the witnesses are handled by the founder. IMO, it's a false problem : first, bitcoin, litecoin, even ethereum are not so decentralised either in the end. Plus, everyone can be a witness if the desire is here. In the end, I really don't care about this problem which will be solved. I love the byteball system : the transactions are so fast, the wallets (full & light) are so cool with a chatbot, a store, a betting platform with smart contract. It's so well-advanced and yet, the lack of communication doesn't help Byteball. Anyway, I still think that there is a future for byteball. Some merchants have already started to accept it and there is an incentive cashback program for them and the consumers. It's just the beginning. **Price predictions ? No clue. But Byteball will forever be in my heart and it should be way higher priced than it is today.**\n\n**IOTA** : like Byteball, the lack of decentralization because of the coordinator or the founder behaviour can frighten people. Again, I don't care : coordinator will be taken off in the future and the founder is just a honest guy who doesn't care about diplomacy. I like that. The tech is awesome, the quickness of the transactions are amazing and there are a lot of collaborations, especially with Bosch. I don't think that people truly understand that IOTA's first goal is not to be used by humans, but by machines. The Internet of things is coming and IOTA has a head start. **Price predictions ? 2$ per MIOTA within two years.**\n\n**ALSO**\n\n**Monero** : what can I say about XMR ? Well, it's truly private. I love privacy. Who doesn't ? I really don't think that any governments are able to stop it. No law has been able to stop Bitcoin, no law will stop XMR. This is the aim of decentralization. And yeah, a lot of people looks Monero as the crime currency. Yet, fiat is the first crime currency and don't forget that Bitcoin used to be looked the same way. Invest into your privacy. **Price predictions ? 300$ within two years.**\n\n**FACTOM** : It amazes me how much people talk about crypto adoption and don't see that FCT is already adopted. It's not a project anymore, it's actually used by corporations. \"Don't believe the hype\", there's no hype with Factom but it's concrete, solid, it's a rock. Invest into the rock. **Price predictions : no clue.**\n\n\n\n**CRYPTOPAYMENTS TOOLS**\n\n**MTL/OMG** : I think that these tools will help crypto a lot to be adopted. MTL & OMG teams are solid and well funded. Everybody is criticizing the hype around OMG but it's not really the team's fault. I will be short : both are good projects, one is more oriented towards the American Market, the other towards the Asia. I'm in both. **Price predictions ? 20$ within two years ?**\n\n\n**My past ICO : Minexcoin / MNX** (and not MNC). You should give a quick look on it. I won't develop because it's coming into its first exchange this month and I don't want to \"shill it\". Just FYI : you have the ability to \"park\" your coins daily, weekly or yearly in order to earn some rewards. It's like PoS or Waves leasing. https://medium.com/minecoin-blog\n\n**My failed bet : Signatum** I don't know if it's the end. Maybe it was just a Miner's P&D. Maybe it's not the end and I would be glad because, besides the FUD around the project, it was interesting.\n\n**In the end, I won't talk about Ethereum but I'm it too. I just think that ICO's are hurting ETH and it tires me. But I'm in. I'm also in BAT, SNGLS, LRC and NEM/XEM but it will be for another time. I'm also paying attention on XRB, DLT, BIS.**",

            "text": "The Crypto King Report Jan 18th: Miami\u2019s BTC Conference, Days Until All Time High? (8-50) + Today\u2019s Picks: DASH (and ARK!)\n\nAs I described yesterday at length there have been multiple factors plaguing the cryptocurrency markets these past few weeks. We were hit with FUD attacks from predominant countries in the crypto world (China and South Korea), while having a wallet hack, options expiration, whales at play, and even an upcoming lunar new year, and a second option expiration. I think the upcoming Chinese lunar new year will not be as impactful in markets due to the severity of the correction the markets just sustained. However, a further pull back in the next 2 weeks could be presumed. I personally do not believe a further contraction in the market will take place but believe yesterday at option expiration as I stated the bull market has begun. Checking the charts last evening and this morning it is evident there are only a few coins down, with many making strides into their extravagant losses this past week. However, with all coins recovering where is it best to have your portfolio allocated?\n\nPersonally I love DASH today, tomorrow, this weekend, in general honestly. The team is great, the ability that they allow their coin holders to vote is impressive in itself. However, my favorite part of the entire DASH short term play is the market turned yesterday. News coming out in any positive form will give a substantial pump to the specific coin. Guess what coin will be trending all day today on social media and in public forums? DASH. They have their name on every required ID badge neck lace. They are sponsoring the Miami BTC conference, the pictures, the tweets, the IGs, will all be DASH related. Did I mention they are hosting the after party at club E11even in Miami? It\u2019s one of the largest strip club/night club combos in the entire country. If anyone remembers what happened with Legend\u2019s token to night before NYE when they hosted a huge event\u2026it skyrocketed. DASH has too large of a market cap to sky rocket, but a 30-50% recovery from a $750 price point seems very realistic to occur by the conclusion of the Miami conference which begins today. ARK will also be presenting there but DASH\u2019s presence will far outpace ARK. However, ARK\u2019s market cap is miniscule in comparison and the exposure for it will truly enter it into the realm of considered coins for many investors.\n\nMy favorite conference plays are DASH due to their high volume presence and publicity that this Miami event will drive the next 72 hours. To follow that up ARK is a fantastic play also available on Binance with presentations occurring during the Miami conference as well. No they are not sponsoring it but it is much easier for a coin with a market cap of $200 million to reach $400 million than for a coin with a market cap of $3 billion to reach $6 billion. I think neither of these plays are 100% returns in the short term but an immediate return higher than market by 10-20% even at the beginning of this bull run is not an opportunity to be missed. Presentations start at 12 EST for DASH and other big presenters (prior to that it is solely ICOs, important but won\u2019t impact the large coin prices).\n\nFollowing the conference I am rotating funds back to STRAT, ICX and NEO (in that order) waiting for the STRAT news and recovery and hoping to roll the proceeds from DASH into STRAT, STRAT into ICX, and ICX into NEO. Looking forward to today\u2019s conference and providing the Kingdom insight in tomorrow\u2019s post .\n",

Well, at first sight, ZNN seems to be a randomly created project since they don't quite ensure themselvs any actual advertising and it doesn't look that funny either. No. What it does is more like completing what bitcoin as we know it. This project most probably started as a challange to the developers to improve, by code and also by users feedback, any other cryptocoins that I know so far. A few steps in this direction count as, but is not limited by\n\n \\-   The Dual-Ledger (Meta-DAG + Block-Lattice) architecture, that actually speeds up the transaction time for not using the old fashioned single handedly blockchain\n\n \\-   Its 3 types of nodes (Pillars, Sentinels, Sentries) ensuring the safetiness of it and implementing a new type of echosystem that allways its users to vote\n\n \\-  PoW-Links with potential Bitcoin interoperability and so lowering the transaction fees but with a better transaction speed\n\n \\-   unikernels based zApps (minimal, standalone virtual machines) controlled by smart contracts \n\nWithin the 3 years of its activity Zenon got in front of many comparable projects and is most likely to hit the tops this altseason. So far, they have developed a wallet that amazingly enable an APY > 55%, they launched the public testnet that constantly takes feedback from the users to improve and also one of the best communities there is with fun but full of info content. All in all, with the Alphanet that's yet to come, this is and invite and a threat to just learn more about it, DYOR, 'cuz info is money, and info is out there so go grab it!",

            "text": "Under current law and depending on where you live... (presuming many of you are in the US) you're ultimately going to have to pay taxes on your crypto gains once you cash out to fiat or even if you buy a single cup of coffee with your crypto\u2026 That is unless of course you want to risk taking an extended holiday at club fed... Sound unbelievable? That's what I thought until I started looking into basic crypto TAX issues\u2026\n\nIdeally when you cash out of your crypto holdings you'd want to pay a lower rate on your capital gains so you'd hold your coins for at least a year and a day to be taxed at the lower long term capital gain rate... Then once you have your cash and need to pay the taxman for that year, you have to establish your cost basis on your tax forms (how much you bought each coin for versus how much you sold them for) Now say you buy a bunch of bitcoin on coinbase at different prices over a period of years... and assuming you do not trade them and immediately create a short term capital gain TAXABLE EVENT (don't even get me started\u2026 more on that later) YOU HOLD YOUR COINS... \n\nNow years later, bitcoin is at 100,000 dollars and you're ready to exit back into fiat through coinbase or something else. How do you establish your cost basis to the feds if you transfer a random portion of your 100 bitcoin stack from your secure wallet to your coinbase wallet and withdraw to your bank account? It is in your best interest to claim that the coins you are cashing out now are the more expensive one which you bought later in your 100 btc stack building so you have a smaller capital gain/cost basis and thus a smaller tax liability\u2026 Remember\u2026 You bought 100 coins originally at different times and different prices and sent all of them to a single wallet where they can't be distinguished from one another... Now it's years later and you want to get out with a couple million dollars and keep as much of it as possible after taxes\u2026 How are you going to account for the cost basis of all these different coins that have been put into the same wallet? Does each BTC itself (not wallet) have a unique ID and history that can be tracked? Now add to the fact that under current IRS regulation, if you TRADE any of these coins\u2026 BITCOIN ETHER LITECOIN RIPPLE\u2026 YOU NAME IT\u2026 You immediately reset the clock on the long term capital gain rate with each trade/shapeshift and have effectively created a TAXABLE EVENT, that according to uncle sam\u2026 you need to pay for in FIAT in the tax year you did it or ultimately face back taxes, interest, penalties and even jail whether you actually cash out any of your stack to fiat (incurring more taxes) or just continue HOLDING\u2026 \n\nRead for yourself\u2026 \n\nhttps://bitcoin.tax/faq\n\nIt's insane.\n\nNow make matters worse\u2026 What if you wanted to cash out what are now 100 bitcoins through coinbase that have been traded back and forth and shapeshifted into countless other cryptos which have obviously been held for less than a year due to your constant trading and stack building\u2026 Can you risk claiming that those 100 BTC are the same 100 BTC you originally bought years ago and as such\u2026 claim that they should be taxed at a long term cap gain rate(which is not the truth)? Does each coin have a history that could get you in trouble if you go that route? Can you get away with it?\n\nNow what happens when you've been trading crypto for years and can't account for your countless trades into and out of different currencies which you have NOT paid short term capital gains tax on going back years even though your digital money has only ever been in digital wallets and exchanges and you haven't spent your crypto on goods or services nor withdrawn a single unit of fiat to your bank account\u2026 How many of you are in this boat? How are you going to exit into fiat and keep your money if this applies to you?\n\nFor those of you constantly trading in and out and between different cryptos over a period of years\u2026 HOW ARE YOU DEALING WITH THIS SHORT TERM CAP GAIN TAX LIABILITY ISSUE WITH EVERY TRADE YOU MAKE EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE NOT REALIZING REAL FIAT GAINS IN A BANK ACCOUNT? Sometimes we all get so caught up in memes and price talk that we neglect to come up with a sound exit strategy\u2026 This is serious stuff that we all need to consider\u2026 We've yet to see a substantial number of people successfully cash out of crypto and ride off into the sunset with millions\u2026 It all may be a fantasy ultimately thanks to uncle sam and his current regulation\u2026 so\u2026 WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS VISA VIE SHORT TERM CAP GAIN TRADING/TAXES/EXIT STRATEGY?",

            "text": "Hidden Small Cap Gem?\n\n$BAX is currently available on KUCOIN at .0009 as of May 2nd 2021 \n\nBABB, a company that aims to become the World Bank for the Micro-Economy,\nstands for Bank Account Based Blockchain. It offers a hybrid decentralised financial service system using a utility ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network.\nTheir vision is to increase businesses on a global scale by improving financial support in communities, help improve living conditions, and have an\noverall impact on countries and the global economy especially those underserved by traditional financial systems.\n\n\nBABB Launching  Cash-Out Fiat Gateways in 36 New Regions\n\nThe app will enable users to convert fiat currency into BABB\u2019s native token throughout Europe, which can be sent abroad.\n\nAccording to the official announcement, users can convert fiat currency (\u00a3/\u20ac) into BAX, which is the BABB\u2019s native token, and then be sent without having to go through interbank networks, in addition to not carrying FX conversion fees.\n\nThe tokens can then be converted to fiat and withdrawn to a bank account in 36 new countries in Europe, including Switzerland, Germany and the U.K.\n\n\nAn alternative to the traditional remittance system\n\nRegarding the measure, the company clarified that the new feature solves the slowness of the traditional P2P remittance system, in addition to the operational expenses that this has, along with \u201cpoor\u201d exchange rates.\n\nSpeaking with Cointelegraph, David Taylor, BABB\u2019s chief marketing officer, commented on the traditional remittances system:\n\nBABB clarified that BAX tokens can be purchased via credit/debit cards and highlighted that they could later be purchased via bank transfers \u201cin the near future.\u201d\n\nAnd The future looks like for the next quarter\n- BABB Will be testing their new services, as well as improve the conversion facility.\n-The app size will be compacted (so they keep the app as effective as they can for users with old generation smartphones).\n-They will be phasing out the Fundraising section and make a few design changes to the app.\n-They will be adding Multi-tokenised wallets.\nWe will be testing the integration of tokenised FIAT to Blockchain (ERC-20, Solana, Algorand, Stellar, etc).\n\n*UK Bank Partner (ClearBank)\n*Swiss Bank Partner (Sygnum)\n*SWIFT Code\n*Bank Code (BIC)\n*FCA Registered and Regulated\n*FCA Crypto License pending\n*Bank Accounts & eMoney license is pending \n*UK eMoney license FCA application complete (SEMI)\n*EU eMoney license application coming soon \n*Application for EU Bank License Dec 2021\n\nAccording to to road map Babb/Bax has delivered on every one of its promises and continues to be a pioneer for this concept of being a blockchain based bank account for everyday retail investors.  \n\nIf Babb delivers on everything it\u2019s claiming to accomplish I\u2019m not sure due to lack of its marketing anyone is going to foresee how huge this project is going to be .\n\nIn essence, BABB is building a decentralized bank powered by the blockchain, operating a full reserve and integrating digital currencies all around the world.\n\nMulti Tokenized Economies \n\nBlack Card\nThe BABB Black Card is a secure payment card that links directly with your BABB bank account via a QR code or NFC. It allows both a debit-like functionality, or it can be issued as a pre-paid card for your friends and family. This approach allowed us to design a simple yet elegant card with no need for a chip and pin.\nWith the BABB Black Card you will be able to spend your funds within your BABB bank account in shops and in-person (peer-to-peer). Retailers can accept payment using the BABB card by simply downloading the BABB app and scanning the QR code or via NFC. Payment is made instantly into the retailer's bank account and the funds can be used immediately.\n\nThe BABB Black Card is the first card of its kind, containing no personal information on the card itself, which greatly improves card security.\nIf the card is lost, it can be easily unlinked from your bank account, preventing anyone else from using it. Should you find your card again, simply scan the QR code on the card via your BABB app and it will link to your BABB bank account once again. If the card is lost permanently, new cards will be available very cheaply from certain major online retailers with next day delivery. Alternatively, you can pick up a spare from a friend, or even print a less durable - but equally functional \n\nUse cases: BABB\u2019s primary use cases are:\nPayments \u2014 Enable payments from payers to payees using the BABB\u2019s infrastructure, mobile apps, and the BABB the black card. \u201cPayments\u201d include scenarios like paying a merchant for goods, a small company using BABB for making payroll payments to employees, etc.\n\nPeer to Peer Cash \u2014 Enable users to withdraw and deposit cash from their accounts when interacting with other users or agents. Users can withdraw a currency from their account that is different from the currency held in the customer account.\n\nPeer to Peer Borrowing/Lending \u2014 Users can use the BABB app to lend and borrow money. BABB is used to set the loan\u2019s terms via smart contracts.\n\nCoding Activity: Did not detect a BABB related repository or coding activity in Github. BABB\u2019s CTO is a founder of Seegno. Most of the technical team members listed on the BABB web site are affiliated with Seegno which is a Portugal based web application development firm that has an active presence in Github.\n\nTeam: From the web site \u2014 \u201cOur team includes successful blockchain entrepreneurs with a proven track record, central bankers, investment bankers, data scientists, crypto investors, researchers and engineers.\u201d The review of the BABB team\u2019s LinkedIn profiles (starting with Rushd Averroes) indicates a team mostly experienced in fintech, payments and banking.\n\n\n\nBABB\u2019s unique vision for the future of banking is both radical and feasible. BABB will empower each individual and business within the microeconomy, by creating a decentralised and inclusive financial system. BABB intends to usher in a new paradigm of Fair Banking, by embracing emerging technologies and applying a \u2018people first\u2019 approach.\nThe BABB platform has huge potential for growth, through the three main touch points of the BABB app, the Black Card and Social KYC. By maintaining a physical and digital presence and implementing a natural viral growth mechanism, we expect to see exponential uptake throughout our target markets. \n\n\nAdvisors/Investors: The advisor team members are mostly based in London and have experience in the areas of fintech, banking, academics and marketing.\nGeneral Thoughts: BABB is an ambitious project whose objective is to help people in the developing world improve their lives via access to first rate banking services. What I think the most interesting aspects of BABB are:\nBABB will make available a UK compliant bank account to any eligible person or business in the world without the need for a UK address or credit history. This means a farmer in Bangladesh could be a holder of UK bank account through BABB and have access to sophisticated financial services via the BABB app on her mobile phone.\n\nBABB will tokenize fiat and make the fiat available for saving, payments, loans, etc. This means that users will not be required to perform any payments, loans, savings with BAX tokens \u2014 they will instead be using relatively nonvolatile fiat currency (INR, USD, EUR, etc.) for these transactions. BABB\u2019s fiat will be held in reserve at BABB and accounted for via BABB\u2019s smart contract logic running on Ethereum. My assumption is that BABB\u2019s tokenized fiat will function in a manner like what Tether (USDT) does today with USD held in reserve to keep the price of Tether constant at $1.\nMy bias is to see a multi year vesting schedule for the project team. The BABB team\u2019s token vesting schedule indicates that the team is thinking long term and that BABB is not a founder\u2019s get rich quick scheme like some other recent ICOs.\n\nMy biggest concern about the development roadmap is how aligned are BABB\u2019s goals with UK banking regulations? My assumption is that the BABB team has a solid understanding of how to comply with the Know Your Customer (KYC ) requirements needed for BABB\u2019s customers to meet UK banking regulations. But the degree of gaps between BABBs goals and UK banking regulations is an unknown for me. This unknown is concerning because not complying with the UK\u2019s banking regulations could prevent BABB from realizing its goals.",

            "text": "3 months ago I posted an article looking at 3 different projects that were tokenizing assets on the blockchain. I wanted to do an update on the article to see where each project was today, as well as what the different price changes compared to 3 months ago.  \n\n2018 was supposed to be the year of the STO (Security Token Offering). Real estate, agriculture, stocks, just about any asset can be digitized and issued using the blockchain. Unfortunately at that time, the world was not quite ready for this revolutionary and disruptive technology. Fast forward the clock several years to today, and now the regulatory and technological roadblocks that once hindered these projects are now clear. Countries are becoming more progressive towards cryptocurrency ( El Salvador just made bitcoin a legal tender) and are ready to utilize it with a real and legitimate use case on the blockchain.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow, is a quick look at 3 projects hanging around from 2018 that are now ready to revolutionize the industry.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Smartlands (SLT)**     \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a small cap gem that has huge growth potential. Smartlands leverages blockchain technology to reduce cost of upwards 50% to entrepreneurs raising funds, companies digitizing and issuing their assets on the blockchain, and fund managers who want to digitize their funds for investors. Smartlands is currently focusing their project around crypto friendly regions like Ukraine at the moment, and will expand into other areas once the proper regulatory approvals are made. This platform uses the Stellar network, which utilizes the Stellar Consensus Protocol to efficiently verify transactions on the blockchain. The SLT token will be used to pay for fees on the platform, and 33% of fees received will go back to SLT owners who have their tokens staked. This project just recently rolled out their platform recently with several property listings and is ready to release their wallet very soon (Staking is live 3 weeks after). Looking at the price changes below, Smartlands has held its ground relatively well during this correction time period in relation to others. The upcoming months will be a very important time for this project, but everything seems to be very promising with this project.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMax Circulating Supply Only 7.2 millions Tokens   \n\n  \n\n||*3 Months Ago*|*Today*|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Market Cap** |27 Million|31 Million|\n|**Price** |$5.54|$6.01|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Polymath (POLY)**  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPolymath is another platform that can be used to create, issue, and manage assets on the blockchain. The Polymath network is a decentralized platform, and the POLY token is its utility token. This token can be staked and is used as \"Fuel\" to run transactions interact with smart contracts on the network. Polymath's all time high was $1.56, and is still way off from its current price, so it should have some good growth potential there. The Polymath network was set to go live with Polymesh at the end of March but has hit a delay due to regulatory hurdles. Polymath seeks to be a one stop shop for tokenzing assets on the blockchain and aims to be a large scale global provider. In my opinion, the largest hurdle for Polymath will be gaining regulatory approval in each different region, but it has very promising upside with it's current price if it can pull it off.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMax Circulating Supply 1 Billion Tokens   \n\n  \n\n||*3 Months Ago*|*Today*|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Market Cap** |260 Million|101 Million|\n|**Price** |$.43|$.16|\n\n  \n\n**Ravencoin (RVN)**   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRavencoin is a digital peer to peer network that aims to implement a use case specific blockchain, designed to efficiently handle one specific function: the transfer of assets from one party to another. RVN is actually a fork on the bitcoin code and has been around since January 3rd, 2018. It utilizes POW (Proof Of Work) to verify and initiate the transfer of assets on the blockchain. RVN has some nice upside potential being quite a bit off from its all time high of $.23.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMax Circulating Supply 21 Billion Tokens   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n||*3 Months Ago*|*Today*|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Market Cap** |1.5 Billion|532 Million|\n|**Price** |$.18|$.058|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to keep it short and concise on each of these projects, but to do it the real justice they deserve I would need to write a lot more information. The last several months have seen quite a fluctuation in prices and whether you think the bear market is now or it is just a consolidation period. Tokenizing assets is revolutionary technology and will be here for the long haul. Please feel free to comment below about anything I left out or about exciting things that are coming up on the projects listed!",

            "text": "Bitcoin by its very design is traceable down to every transaction. This major heist has left many members tracking the flow of transactions down a binary tree. Whoever was behind this knows they are being watched and knows they can\u2019t easily cash out without revealing their identity.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/sn7VsAJ.png\n \n\nSo the question remains, How can they get away with cashing out without being discovered?\n\nGraphic: http://imgur.com/a/B7hkv\n \n\nOne method is through dark cryptocurrencies like anon coin and dark coin. These altcoins have coin mixing protocols in the code or the ability to operate on darksend protocols. This makes it extremely difficult to trace specific transactions to specific addresses. While the binary tree is dispersing the wealth of bitcoins across many addresses they are most likely going to create a few accounts on trading platforms that deal with dark cryptos and start exchanging their bitcoins for AnonCoins and DarkCoins. Now these dark cryptos have already seen some recent spikes in demand shortly following the heist. This may be evidence that whoever got away with that wealth of bitcoins may already be testing this method. They would be using dark crypto coin exchanges as a proxy by converting the stolen bitcoins into dark cryptos and then turning them back into bitcoins under a different account. This method would allow them to cash out from entirely different wallet addresses and an entirely different Identity.\n\nWe can\u2019t expect to see these trading platforms step in and stop any transactions once they realize some bitcoins they are receiving came from a distant branch of the initial binary tree.   If this post gets enough attention the trading platforms could be notified to watch for binary tree extension transactions to their own deposit accounts.  This could be applied as a method to investigate the real identity of these movers.  We (the community) would also have no way of knowing if any of these addresses represent internal and therefore unpublished wallet addresses of particular trading platforms.\n\nIn the highly probable event this tactic is applied, we may see a spike in demand for these dark crypto coins as they have a lot of bitcoins to move if they want to cash them all out.  This indicates they are most likely testing this method now and preparing to move large amounts soon. For these reasons AnonCoin and DarkCoin may see a huge spike in demand very soon.\n\nWhat do you guys think? \nAre there any holes in this theory?\n",

            "text": "[https://www.coingecko.com/nl/coins/get-protocol](https://www.coingecko.com/nl/coins/get-protocol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, a little short introduction on what GET protocol is:\n\nThe GET Protocol offers a blockchain-based smart ticketing solution that can be used by everybody who needs to issue tickets(NFTs) in an honest and transparent way. To date **over 650.000** have been sold. It didn't only end ticket scalping but offers many advantages to event organisers, artists and fans.\n\nWhy I'm looking forward to the coming weeks and months.\n\nAfter very bullish first months of 2021 for GET the sentiment has turned around at the beginning of April. Many people took profit and GET/ETH is down around -66% since. I personally think this is the perfect enrtry and there are many catalysts to turn it around.\n\nFirst of all there was no real reason for the selloff. It started with some large holders taking profit and others panicking. This is normal and happens with every project after such rallies. Fundamentally nothing has changed. It did give everyone else a nice entry!\n\nIn the last quarter GET protocol processed 216 163 ticket statechanges and conducted buybacks from exchanges and burned tokens worth $57 220 at the moment of burn. This quarter already 172 520 statechanges have been processed. **17 249 tickets have been sold in the last 24h**! GET is alive and kicking!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2g4zakte4cy61.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b16d122c30965aaa9a5c43e341051427f4ca4fe\n\nLooking at Israel: they are almost covid19 free after vaccinating around 60% of the population. Most Western countries are weeks away from being at the same place. This means that we'll most likely see a lot of restrictions being easened in the following weeks/months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/69yv81gg4cy61.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c38d0f76d3e95af77a31f97abf887fe77c353d9\n\nWith that we'll see a lot more events. Knowing that the ticketing volume in general is probably down more than 90% due to the virus, I think it's safe to say that the number of tickets processed will **increase by a big factor** in the coming period (and with it the buybacks!)\n\nFundamentally nothing has changed. NFT tickets are still hot and many **famous entrepreneurs** are not only endorsing it but **want to implement it**. When you read them describing how ticketing should work in the future, it's like they're word by word describing GET protocol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cbujs51k4cy61.jpg?width=1729&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02b8556ad1e45e5ef9083591bdca250212bbf701\n\nThe great thing about GET is that anyone can easily set up their own ticketing company on top of it (being an integrator through \"white-labeling\"). GET only offers them the tools to do so. And the **requests keep piling in** (3 a day on average from parties all over the globe).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a0qsb1yk4cy61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3dca68247e801a6a9e06652e580236ac6dc85e41\n\nWith the protocol shifting to complete decentralization, it will be governed by the token holders. The logical step is for them to buy themselves in. And some big whale accounts have already been doing so, even during this dip. For example this wallet\n\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3786bf25e15013fdda09dbe881529d44b9ca239](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3786bf25e15013fdda09dbe881529d44b9ca239)\n\n(the wallet is worth around **90 million $ and has been accumulating GET** even during the dip - smart money is buying).\n\nThe advantages of NFT tickets compared to regular tickets are obvious to everyone. Another amazing thing is that the ticketing companies, that integrate the tools GET offers, feed from eachother and take eachother's strong points. **They improve one another**!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fu04x1bn4cy61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea281fe2ed61a369748b0d651bfaf78cc0f8b737\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fgvzh2do4cy61.jpg?width=523&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0978aec823516ec361ee4bccf2baa20c85c5c7c4\n\nSo what can we expect in the near future?\n\nWe'll see a lot of **ticket sales** and **buybacks**, that's for sure! Not only will the lifting of restrictions boost the ticket sales of GUTS but all the new integrators will thrive as well!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kct5jb9q4cy61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=adbf522e90220ba42ec4e60ceb36bfcf67f17504\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/io7rg5ts4cy61.jpg?width=740&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b251e01a24d80eac977d547247fe464838b2a1c0\n\nIn the last blog it was hinted that several **new integrators**, in several countries across the globe, will be integrated on the short term. There are also talks with big players in the US of A! Just one big name joining (which is inevitable) will create a lot of hype.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe new **NFTticket explorer** is set to be released on the short term. This will be a groundbreaking explorer that will let you check the validity of your ticket and the entire history it went through. Much needed transparency coming to the ticketing world!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6nso3dv4cy61.jpg?width=862&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1c6bf49b2992de23a82ada21c1cae5a9932f94d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l0ip0uxv4cy61.jpg?width=870&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89b6e7b0c0547d39e77c363aaa2899a3df3cc620\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**New/upgraded tokenomics**\n\nEventhough I believe that GET's tokenomics are one of the best in the space and will push the price organically, even **improved ones are on the way**! With event financing coming, another layer that captures value will be added to the token.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u809oshz4cy61.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0b9c8850e75c005a07f7550cbd7e025eaa36601\n\n**DAO - governance**\n\nAs stated above: GET protocol will be a **fully decentralised protocol** in the future. The first steps towards decentralisation have been taken. 10 million GET tokens have been burned and 2,6 million tokens (worth 15 million$ at the time of writing) will be governed by the token holders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tj7fg4125cy61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f065af2d642ca4007c8c9304c94aa8dc8893f492\n\nThese are just some of the catalysts that will change the sentiment. **GET is still miles ahead compared to most crypto projects when it comes to adoption, tokenomics, the problem it solves**, ... It just lacks hype but imagine one of those big shots like Mark Cuban mentioning GET, let alone implementing it. The sky would be the limit even on the short term!\n\nWe like to joke around in the community that 1000$ is programmed due to the increasing demand (buybacks) and decreasing supply (the bought tokens are burned forever) but one thing is certain:\n\nTime is in favour of GET holders and patience will certainly be rewarded!",

Exchange BTC-E seized by FBI- locking users funds\n\n**Mid 2017**\n\nBTC-E, a popular exchange in the past, was seized by the FBI over the alleged Alexander Vinnik who was found guilty of laundering funds through the exchange. Alexander Vinnik was originally thought to be one of the operators of the website, however these claims were denied by BTC-E later on.  \n\n\n\nSince then BTC-E has shipped operations to New Zealand and re-branded to WEX. It is believed that most users have been able to access their funds.\n\nHaving said that, it was difficult time during the down-time, with all users unsure if they\u2019d ever be able to access their funds. Although the user base continues to grow, the community had been split over BTC-E. Several users have resisted transacting on the exchange due to their secretive operations.\n\nOn the other hand BTC-E has had significant support, one user commenting \u201cBTC-E deserves respect\u201d over their commitment to re-opening the portal to it\u2019s users.\n\n\nIt has been in-evident that BTC-E played any part in the laundering. So, although BTC-E may not have been 100% at fault- the story does show you the risk you put yourself against trusting a third party to mind your coins for you.\n\n## 4.

Regardless of how the **438.318 Bitcoin** went missing- it clearly shows the lack of protective measures exchanges get away with.\n\nCoinsecure claims that they are working \u201c_day in and day out, and investigations are in full swing for a possible recovery of the lost BTC_\u201d. However they are treading carefully, even with their promises, their website states \u201cshould we be able to recover all of our BTC, all BTC holdings will be refunded\u201d. Key words being \u2018should we be able to\u2019.\n\n## 3. Italian exchange BitGrail claims $195 million worth of Nano (XRB) lost through hack\n\n**February 2018**\n\nThe exchange claimed that the cryptocurrency was [stolen through a hack](http://fortune.com/2018/02/11/bitgrail-cryptocurrency-claims-hack/). Bitgrail have not accepted responsibility for the breach, claiming that the Nano cryptocurrency was flawed.\n\nNano on the other hand [continues to hold its ground](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/03/15/bitgrail-nano-hack-cryptocurrency/), stating: \u201cto date, all reliable evidence we have reviewed continues to point to a bug in BitGrail\u2019s exchange software as the reason for the loss of funds.\u201d\n\n> Once again, BitGrail confirms to have been a victim of theft. A crime made possible by taking advantage of known failures in the NANO team\u2019s various software (Rai Node and the Official Block Explorer) and therefore, for these reasons and in accordance with the law, BitGrail doesn\u2019t consider itself responsible for the unforeseen circumstances.- [Official statement from BitGrai](https://bitgrail.com/news)l\n\nAfter several months of halt, Bitgrail has announced a commencement of operations on 2 May 2018 at 10:00 UTC stating, \u201cthe markets and withdrawals will be operating for all coins, except for NANO/XRB. BitGrail re-open the NANO/XRB market for users at a date to be announced shortly.\u201d\n\n## 2. $400 Million Goes Missing From Japanese cryptocurrency Exchange Coincheck\n\n**January 2018**\n\nYet another unsettling few months for investors as they wait for **500 million XEM tokens** to be refunded after [they were stolen](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-26/cryptocurrencies-drop-after-japanese-exchange-halts-withdrawals). The **Japanese exchangehalted all trading** at the time and have recently restarted trading. This was regarded as **one of the biggest cryptocurrency thefts**, next to the infamous Mt Gox saga.  \n\n\n## 1. Mt. Gox Declares bankruptcy over 850,000 missing Bitcoin\n\n**2011\u20132014**\n\nMt. Gox at its prime was regarded as one of the biggest Bitcoin exchanges. Unfortunately, it **came to a nasty end** once it was found that an extensive number of Bitcoins went missing. Investigations in 2015 found that the **coins went missing over time, starting in 2011**.\n\nBy far, the **most infamous and nerve wrecking loss in the history of cryptocurrency**. The saga continues to date though, with the trustee claiming to [have sold a large chunk of Bitcoin in early 2018](https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/03/07/mt-gox-crashed-bitcoin-trustee-sold-bottom-blockchain-data-reveals). It was [speculated](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgoxinsolvency/comments/82m0dl/mtgox_trustee_has_sold_some_btc_and_bch/) but not definitive that this had a large hand in causing the Bitcoin crash around the time.  \n\n\n\n\nThe above is not intended to spread FUD. It is a reminder to be careful on how you store your cryptocurrency and **raise awareness of the potential risks.**\n\nThe statement \u2018**be your own bank**\u2019, rings true still. It will continue to do so until we can receive service offerings that combine cryptocurrency with _convenience, trust_, and _security_. Having said that, there are also severe risks you carry if you do become your own bank. Damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t!\n\n[Here\u2019s](https://blockogy.com/cryptocurrency/whats-best-way-store-cryptocurrency/) a quick run down on [different storage methods for cryptocurrency](https://blockogy.com/cryptocurrency/whats-best-way-store-cryptocurrency/) **and their associated risks**.\n\nMost of the cryptocurrencies in the market today are based on ERC20. So you can also [download this free guide on storing Ethereum and ERC20 tokens](https://blockogy.com/storing-ethereum-erc20-tokens/).\n\n\n\nBut if you decide to continue storing your cryptocurrency on an exchange you may want to do the following:  \n\n\n1.  Diversify across multiple exchanges- keeping your crypto on multiple exchange means less risk of losing ALL your holdings in case one exchange goes down or shuts down\n2.  Keep a small portion on an exchange for transfers while the rest in [cold storage.](https://blockogy.com/cryptocurrency/whats-best-way-store-cryptocurrency/)\n",

            "text": "Understanding Crypto-Currency Market Dynamics and the Role of BTC, DOGE, and CGB (draft - requesting constructive criticism)  \npapersheepdog  \n  \n  \n*A special note* to the [**Bitcoin** community](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin): All that we have done here would not be possible without your innovation. This trailblazing has left you in a unique position as a highly liquid market gateway which we all rely so heavily on. There will always be a top place for you so long as you maintain this distinction. **Bitcoin TL;DR:** Your community must focus on bridging the divide between government issued fiat currencies and the new realm of digital currencies. You are the gatekeeper that allows us all to prosper and to reach the next level, we need a system of exchanges that can handle a tsunami of fleeing capital which we are likely to soon witness. Government regulations, restrictions and FUD will stand in your way but you must accept this challenge and restore free market principals to the peoples' selection of their currency.  \n  \n*A special note* to the [**Dogecoin** community](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogecoin): We appreciate what you have done for all crypto-currencies by bringing us mainstream excitement. You are lifting us all higher but you cannot do it alone. A healthy ecosystem requires that one currency cannot fulfil all roles. Hopefully this document will help you to understand your bright future within it. **Dogecoin TL;DR:** The value of your currency is derived from the size of the community that trades and accepts Dogecoin. You must work tirelessly to spread the word and get people excited to be using Dogecoin and to accept it at their businesses. When businesses and individuals can operate by spending their earned Dogecoin instead of converting it to government issued fiat, you will have established lunar orbit. To say this another way, your ultimate goal is to create a diverse Dogecoin ecosystem that no longer relies on government issued fiat.  \n  \n*A special note* to the [**Cryptogenic Bullion** community](http://www.reddit.com/r/CryptogenicBullion/): Visionary conception has created a cryptographic asset that is designed with the properties of money, modelled after the gold supply, and whose purpose is to store wealth. This currency could not have come to maturity at a better time as we are seeing a loss of confidence in the  financial industry and a rising demand for Gold and Silver across the globe. **Cryptogenic Bullion TL;DR:** Your community must focus on enhancing the ability of CGB to act as a store of wealth. This includes developing safer ways to store CGB, and safer ways to utilize one's private wallet keys in a secure, offline manner. This focus on safety must include initiatives to make it easier and simpler for curious new community members to participate.  The CGB community must also focus on investor education to help smoothly guide capital from the old economy to the new.  \n  \n*A special note* to the **general crypto-currency community:** You are all an integral part of the true free market capitalism that is occurring in this new digital space. Although I highlight three currencies as prime examples of filling a certain role, the vibrant community that you are all a part of is what has allowed these examples to exist. There is plenty of room along side these examples for others to try to fill a similar role. So long as new and innovative crypto-currencies are launched and given a fair chance to compete, we should all be willing to adapt and change to accept them in order to brighten our collective future.\n  \n---    \n  \nThis document is intended to be used by our collective communities as a guide to come together and provide this new digital space with the services and functions required to support capital and commerce. The crypto-currency FX (foreign exchange) market is very new, and confusion about the fundamentals is currently the most dominant force underlying it. As more professional and seasoned investors begin to take notice of these markets, logic will begin to manifest itself more predominantly in the price action of the various options available. This is the reason that it is necessary for us all to do our homework if we wish to be not only on the profitable side of a trade, but on the side that allocates capital to deserving innovations.  \n  \nThe cryptographic currency market can naturally be seen as part of the greater foreign exchange market which includes all government issued fiat currencies. Many parallels can be drawn and it can get very technical. For the purposes of this document I have left out some distinctions which are not relevant to the overall understanding of the concept and would likely cause confusion. I may also update the document as discussion develops these ideas. We will begin by defining some basic elements found in these markets, the forces that are at play, and details on the roles to be fulfilled in this new economy.\n  \nThe **monetary base** of a currency is the total number of units of a currency that are in existence. The monetary base can expand or contract. Expansion happens through mining and minting, while contraction occurs if a wallet is permanently lost.  Although the monetary base may expand, if the new units are being held and not put on to the market, they may not cause a loss in relative value known as **inflation**. Correspondingly, if a large amount of the currency is lost forever or simply held by the population, an apparent shortage of the currency eventually forces the market to realize a higher exchange rate, identified as **deflation**. These forces act to stabilize the market as low relative prices encourage spending, and high relative prices encourage saving, thus maintaining a steady exchange rate and flow (ie. velocity of money).  \n  \n**Unit price** is the cost per unit currently found on the open market for a particular crypto-currency. In a currency with a very low expansion rate, this would be primarily affected by the flow of capital. Currencies experiencing a high expansion rate of the monetary base will require a supply of capital inflow to balance against the base expansion, called the **maintenance cost**. As the unit price doubles, so does the capital inflow rate requirement (maintenance cost). This dynamic becomes readily apparent when the unit price rises too quickly for the capital inflow rate to maintain the new price and a correction must occur. In addition to capital inflow, the maintenance cost can also be countered by members of the community who choose to hold and save their currency.  \n  \n**Market capitalization** can simply be seen as the total amount of capital that has been invested into a currency. For these markets, normally it is measured in USD, but it could be measured in BTC or any other currency. Usually we would measure this in the currency that we are more familiar with or the one which we perceive to be the most useful. From an investment point of view, market capitalization is a measure of popularity but not necessarily profitability. Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the unit price by the number of units. Investors are primarily concerned with the unit price because this is the direct value of what they hold. If the capital inflow is directly balancing against the expansion of the monetary base (paying the maintenance cost) we will see an increase in market capitalization over time, without an increase in unit price.  \n\nThere are many different ways a currency can be used and they have different **effects on the market capitalization** depending on how long the capital is held in it. They can be used for their **market access** with capital flowing in to one trade pair (eg. USD/BTC) and exiting out of another (eg. BTC/CGB). These are the most market neutral transactions as the currency is not held for long. **Moving funds** from one location or person to another can be accomplished by buying into the market and selling back out the same trade pair at the other location. (eg. BTC/USD). This transaction also represents no intention to hold and will become neutral once completed. **Buying to spend** does immediately imply a boost to market capitalization like all other actions, but when it is spent, the recipient may convert it to another currency, causing the action to be market capitalization neutral overall. **Buying to invest** has the very same effect, yet the duration of the hold can often be much longer meaning a greater benefit to the market capitalization. **Buying to save** is the most market capitalization positive action because savings are usually intended to be held long-term.\n\nDifferent crypto-currencies have different properties depending on their programming and life-cycle which can make them better suited to a certain task than another. The three primary duties which a crypto-currency can fulfil are market gateway, adopted currency, and store of wealth. A **market gateway** is a currency whose popularity has granted it high volume market access to many other currencies both government issued fiat and digital. This allows fast (liquid) and fair market access to serve a wide population base composed of all of the supported markets. An **adopted currency** is one which is used for daily transactions among a population (group of users). The ideal adopted currency is one which expands its monetary base at the same rate of growth as the user base. This maintains stable prices even as capital flows in to the currency. A **store of wealth** is an asset that has the properties of money and should maintain its value over time. It should have a low inflation rate and/or a return on investment to maintain the incentive to hold it.\n\nIt is helpful to use real world examples to explain the concepts covered within this document. For this I will be exploring three crypto-currencies which I believe serve as a good example of each use case. **Bitcoin (BTC)** serves as an excellent market gateway, **Dogecoin (DOGE)** has been widely adopted as a currency, and **Cryptogenic Bullion (CGB)** serves as a store of wealth. I will explain how each one of these fits within its own role and the moderating role of investors in each.\n\n**Bitcoin** was the first crypto-currency to market and has achieved the greatest exposure to markets than any other. Hundreds of trade pairs exist on many exchanges between BTC and both government issued fiat and digital currencies. Its market capitalization is best tied to its use as a **market gateway** and for moving funds from one location or person to another. These activities cause volatility which is smoothed out by investors. If it is believed that the volume of market transactions will go up, or capital will need to flow between locations at a higher rate, investors will buy in anticipation and take profit by providing liquidity as the demand arrives. This should be the main dynamic at play in Bitcoin but since it is one of the first to market, it has also attempted to serve as currency and store of wealth but we can see that it does not perform these tasks as well as others.\n\n**Dogecoin** is the first crypto-currency to sustain a growth trajectory through the fun and excitement of using cryptographic currency, and the socially viral aspect of a meme. Through its wide and quickly spreading adoption it is beginning to properly serve its role as an **adopted currency**. With enough places accepting Dogecoin in exchange for products and services, it will achieve a sustainable velocity as merchants and businesses are able to spend the Dogecoin in their community, as opposed to converting back to government issued fiat currency. This should be seen as the ultimate goal of any newly adopted currency. If it is believed that Dogecoin will be held and used at an expanding rate beyond its maintenance cost, investors should bid up the price, and then take profit by providing liquidity as this increased demand is realized.\n\n**Cryptogenic Bullion** is the first crypto-currency to display all of the properties of money, while providing the bearer with interest for holding it. It is portable, divisible, fungible, scarce, low inflation, durable, non-consumable, and a **store of wealth**. Unlike most other crypto-currencies, CGB has already completed its volatile monetary base expansion stage and is settling in to its maximum target of 2% expansion per year. As capital finally flees the economic bubbles created by the parabolic increase in the global fiat monetary base, it will find its way into both traditional stores of wealth such as Gold and Silver, but also into new opportunities like low inflation crypto-currencies. This will greatly benefit all crypto-currencies as the rising tide lifts all boats, but in this case, not all boats are created equal.\n\nIt is important as market participants that we understand the bigger picture of what is happening to cause interest and investment in this uncharted territory. We can look back to 1971 when Nixon removed the US dollar, and therefore the rest of the world which had its currencies pegged to it, from the price of gold. With US Dollars now having value derived only from their military imposed monopoly on the export of oil known as the petrodollar system, the manipulation and corruption of the world economy that ensued is now coming to a climax. The system that serves to wipe out the middle class  and concentrate the worlds wealth into the hands of those most able to corrupt the political process is finally being replaced by digital currencies which give special favour to no one. We are witnessing the death throes of the old guard as it tries to frame digital currencies as money laundering, terrorist financing, untrustworthy, failures. One needs only to look at what the fiat US Dollar has brought us to know that we could not possibly do worse than this corrupted system we seek to replace.\n\n**TL;DR**: A TL;DR is available at the top for each community. The general idea here is that one crypto-currency cannot do all and we must work together to realize our common goals.",

BlackWallet realized the hack was occurring and tried to reach out to customers to prevent their attempting to login and transfer. Many users continued in a panic frenzy to login, allowing hackers to gain access to their account and depriving them of their XLM. Hacks have occurred in the past and as we all know it creates a panicked frenzy within the crypto space. When I saw there was a crypto hack I immediately opened the article and spoke to a higher power pleading that it wasn\u2019t on KuCoin, Binance or Jaxx. If I felt this anxiety even for a short period of time, the entire market felt it 10 fold which is why there was panic last night and this morning.  This is factor A causing today\u2019s market crash.\n\nChina FUD:\nIt was less than a week ago that we were dealing with South Korea FUD and our U.S. news agencies lying about what was actually occurring. The \u201ctrue\u201d South Korean story has changed probably 6x depending on which news site you follow. Allegedly South Korea raided their exchanges and was going to crack down and ban crypto trading, as of 1 week ago. There were blaring red headlines on every phone app, \u201cSouth Korea Moves to Ban Crypto.\u201d It turns out they do not want fake names used for trading accounts and want taxes paid. Seems like they are trying to legitimize it, not ban it. Yet our news agencies pumped \u201cfake news\u201d down our throats causing market panic and an impeding collapse. This was last week. We were just starting to recover from that when yesterday\u2019s hack and the China FUD occurred.\n\nChina stated yesterday that they were going to continue to intensify their crackdown on the crypto markets. They already have some bans in place but this statement moves to ban exchange clearing platforms and \u2018offline\u2019 exchanges. Every individual already trading in China is doing it underground or in cities like Hong Kong (where many exchanges are located) to get around these bans. This is strictly FUD that should have had no impact on the markets but clearly caused a BTC crash (along with the rest of the cryptos). This is factor B impacting today\u2019s market crash.\n\nConference Consolidation:\nConferences start within 48hrs, with conferences running from Miami to London, to South Korea, to San Francisco and back across the Middle East and Asia! Prior to conferences and major price climbs there is always a consolidation among the whales. Stocking up at discounted prices prior to a big pump in market cap. The total market cap has fallen to pre January lows in this week\u2019s recent FUD attacks (2 FUD attacks!), and wallet hacks. The last factor adding to the doom and gloom the market is currently facing is consolidation by those with unlimited funds of very cheap alts. If you have the money to be shopping right now, it will pay handsomely before the month is over.\n\nThis concludes the educational portion of today, if you\u2019d like a topic reported on please let me know and I\u2019d be happy to add it this week! I usually write a Daily Crypto Report that includes 1. Lessons (similar to above), 2. Safe Picks for January, 3. Conference Plays, 4. Moonshot Explanations (multiple coins up over 400% in 2 weeks), and 5. ICOs! Feel free to follow me if you\u2019d like to see today\u2019s full report vs. just the educational lesson portion. If you have any topics you want explored please let me know!\n\nThe 3 Safe January plays that I\u2019ve been screaming from the rooftops for the last week are NEO, STRAT and ICX. NEO is sponsoring DevCon, has upcoming gas payments and the most impressive calendar for the next month out of any coin. STRAT has their ICO platform and 2 flagship ICOs being announced next week. ICX has a conference in the largest building in Seoul (they are the South Korean Ether/Love) on January 25th as they release their mainnet. These 3 coins will do major things this month.",

I would recommend MyEtherWallet (be careful of phishing, though) unless you have the cash to spend on a Ledger or similar hardware wallet; hardware wallets are more secure.\n\nIf you do make your own wallet, you can track balances easily using the Etherscan website. Additionally, there are many Android and iPhone apps that can see these wallets and keep you updated. \n\nThere are also some apps that can track your holdings on exchanges using their APIs. I currently use the Cryptoport app to track my Bittrex, Coinbase, Gdax, and wallet balances.\n\nEDIT: I should also note my process to buy altcoins. I purchase ETH on Coinbase, then transfer the ETH to my Bittrex account where I trade for altcoins. After acquiring, I can transfer the ERC20 tokens to my ETH wallet where I have full control of them.",

You can then purchase BTC or ETH on Coinbase/GDAX and send to your wallet address for BTC or ETH in your Binance account.  \n\nBinance doesn't use US dollar or Euros or Pounds so you'll need to use BTC or ETH to buy your altcoins.  I recommend ETH as it has lower fees than BTC.  \n\nAfter you have purchased, it's definitely best to transfer them to a hard wallet.  The reason is that a lot of exchanges and individual exchange accounts have been hacked in the past and some people feel that you don't actually own your coins until you've gotten them off the exchange and into a personal wallet.\n\nAs for hard wallets, I personally have the Nano Ledger S which I felt was a good user experience.  They only support some coins though so be sure you research which coins are supported before you buy a specific wallet.  TREZOR is the other popular hard wallet I know of.  And make sure you read about how to back up the seeds/passphrases for your devices.\n\nAs for how do we trust those companies, it's a good thing to be skeptical of, but those two companies have been around for awhile now and have a good reputation.  I believe their apps are open source so they've been audited by other developers.  They're also make tons of money selling these things so it would be a big loss to lose their reputations.  But I suppose it is possible.  That being said, I've seen people say it's best to buy your device direct from the manufacturer and not on Ebay.  \n\nLots of people use coinmarketcap.com to monitor prices.  Some people like to use http://www.countmycrypto.com/ for a snapshot of your current portfolio.  There are also sites like this for price alerts: https://coinmarketalert.com/",

I am merely pointing out a concern I had and trying to see if anyone knows of information that would disprove it. I only posted after spending considerable time searching and being very surprised at how opaque the RH crypto operation is, overall, in comparison to exchanges of their size that have all sorts of technical info posted in public and easily accessible.\n\n/start: TLDR\n\nThere is two problems that could be potentially happening right now.\n\n1. People buying and selling billions of crypto assets, with zero impact on the price of those. In regular exchanges, they check the buys and sells from the source of truth, the blockchain itself, and adjust the prices based on that.\n2. (Applies mostly for smaller coins) There could be more coins being traded than actually exist in the blockchain.\n\n/end: TLDR\n\nBlockchain was invented to guarantee transparency and give peace of mind about problems like that happening from existing fiat centrally-managing systems, but with trading-only exchanges like RobinHood, there is no guarantee of protecting against those anymore. I could be wrong and there is a page somewhere that has information that proves otherwise, but I couldn't find it, hence trying to pick up your brains by posting this.\n\nRobinHood doesn't allow transferring coins in or out. Never had and never will (from everything they talked about so far at least). It only allows buying and selling.\n\nAre there are any actual underlying coins at all anywhere in the system? For smaller coins in particular, does this mean that in theory there could be more coins traded than existing supply?\n\nIs there an SEC regulation that mandates they hold actual coins?\n\nSince there are no transfers in, how do they obtain the crypto they're \"selling\" to you?\n\nDo they have a wallet for each crypto currency? Is the app-only transaction volume public?\n\nDoes the SEC compare and verify the in-app transactions match with the wallet transactions for each crypto asset?\n\nIs any of this public so anyone can go into the Blockchain and compare the RH buying/selling volume to that of the actual wallet on the Blockchain?\n\nIf the trades are naked, does that mean there could be massive buy and sell operations happening there that do not have any impact on the crypto price since no one else can see them? i.e. Buying or selling a billion BTC would be reflected in the blockchain and all exchanges would act and raise or lower the BTC price, but if the RobinHood trades are all naked, that won't happen. That, would be really weird. It would be like a parallel universe where the laws and supply and demand no longer exist.\n\nThe information they released is so limited and I couldn't find anything useful to confirm or deny my thoughts. Even assuming that RH was trading covered crypto assets, Is anything that could prevent anyone exchange from creating a fully-naked crypto exchange?\n\nI am writing this in case someone knows any better.",

At that time, the crypto investment firm\u2019s management claimed Africrypt\u2019s trading system had been breached. This breach compromised client accounts, wallets, and nodes, thus forcing Africrypt to freeze all accounts, the directors claimed.\n\nHowever, shortly after the so-called breach, Africrypt directors Ameer Cajee and his brother Raees Cajee are alleged to have \u201ctransferred the crypto investment\u2019s pooled funds from its South African account(s) through bitcoin on the blockchain in April 2021.\u201d South African media reports estimate that as much as $3.6 billion in investor funds cannot be accounted for.\nMeanwhile, in his response to a media inquiry, FNB spokesperson Nadiah Maharaj refused to acknowledge the existence of any relationship between FNB and Africypt. According to a media report, Maharaj, who cites client confidentiality restrictions, stated:\nAn investigation by local media suggests that after successfully siphoning investors\u2019 funds, the Cajee brothers fled to the United Kingdom. These findings are also corroborated by another investigation by Hanekom Attorneys, a law firm that has been retained by victims of the Africrypt fraud. In addition to these findings, the law firm\u2019s investigations further reveal that Africrypt directors had used mixers in an attempt to obfuscate the flow of the funds.\n\nWhile the case has now been reported to the Hawks (South Africa\u2019s elite police unit), the founder of the law firm, Darren Hanekom, is quoted in the report as suggesting Africrypt\u2019s accounts with FNB have already been \u201cdrained\u201d and that \u201cthe entirety of investors\u2019 funds\u201d may have been subjected to the mixing service.",

Apart from a recent ad in Times Square (https://twitter.com/fayliela/status/958884043004657664), Elastos has been under the radar. The amount of collaborations, investors, and new dApps being announced is staggering and it's difficult for me to keep up with all of them so as always, DYOR and treat this as a primer on ELA. *This is not trading advice, take what you will from here and make your own decisions*.\n\n**What is Elastos?**\n\nElastos aims to create a new Internet powered by blockchain technology. Rong Chen, founder of Elastos, and his team have created Elastos OS, an entire operating system as well as a virtual machine and runtime that can help developers integrate Elastos into existing applications we use and love on every major operating system, today. So you can literally integrate Elastos into an iOS or Android app, or a Windows or Mac app (credit to /u/matrixapp). Elastos has already delivered on this promise having just released their prototype mobile OS https://twitter.com/bytesizecapital/status/961812042305777665. \n\nOn this new Internet, people will be able to own digital assets, generate wealth from them, run distributed applications, all while utilizing the immutable and superior security of the blockchain. Today, there is a seemingly infinite supply of digital books, movies, music and games. But people do not necessarily own their digital property. You can purchase a digital book, for example, but you can\u2019t sell it to anyone else. So, do you really own it? Property rights pave the way for wealth creation, and Elastos intends to build a new World Wide Web that respects those rights. With Elastos, *users are also the owners* of their own data.\n\n*Bitcoin = Trustworthy Ledger*\n\n*Ethereum = Trustworthy Ledger + Smart Contracts*\n\n*Elastos = Trustworthy Ledger + Smart Contracts + Monetizable Dapps and Digital Assets*\n\nElastos has already delivered a mobile OS, mainnet, wallet, and announced the first 5 dApps for the platform including Zapya which has 400 million current users.\n\n**Who are Elastos backers/partners?**\n\n- NEO's Da Hongfei is an investor and advisor to Elastos, as is Bitmain's Jihan Wu.\n\n- Foxconn (world\u2019s largest electronics manufacturer)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn: Elastos received a $31 million sponsorship from Foxconn group for R&D https://medium.com/@elastos/an-introduction-to-elastos-fd9af7ac1f3b\n\n- SAIC Motor (China\u2019s largest auto manufacturer) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIC_Motor: SAIC motor has officially partnered with Elastos to use Elastos\u2019 blockchain technology in the development of autonomous driving technology/smart cars.

(SEED) (\"the Company\" or \"Origin\") an agricultural biotechnology trait and corn seed provider, and Elastos Foundation today announced their plan to develop a global strategic partnership for mutually beneficial joint activities fostering smart economic solutions to establish platforms to serve global agribusiness transactions, data services, and rural e-commerce activities. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/origin-elastos-announce-collaboration-developing-153400890.html\n\n- Perfect World/Cryptic Studios gaming: Fay Li, chief marketing officer for ELA, tweeted the following - https://twitter.com/fayliela/status/959909521756848128 \"stay tuned for the first gigantic gaming platform soon.\" This was followed by another tweet from a gaming studios offices: https://twitter.com/fayliela/status/960610569471410176. In the comments, a few sleuths zoomed in on the photos to reveal the certainty that the offices belong to Cryptic Studios, which is owned by Perfect World Entertainment. \n\nTogether, they're the owners/developers/publishers/China distributors of the following games: Counterstrike GO, Magic the Gathering, Star Trek Online, Dota 2, Dungeons & Dragons, Neverwinter, and more (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_World_Entertainment).\n\n- Zapya (400 million users, p2p file sharing app): Zapya agrees to build on top of Elastos https://twitter.com/fayliela/status/939068214411067392\n\n- Tencent: Sunny Feng, co founder of Elastos and a professor at Columbia University, has deep connections with Tencent. He recently published a book on blockchain that was recommended by Tencent, and has regularly met with Tencent trustees and angel investors to discuss cooperation with Elastos. https://twitter.com/sunnyfenghan/status/963305861346156544, https://twitter.com/fayliela/status/960734800691716096, \n\n**What is G3?**\n\nDa Hongfei of NEO and Jihan Wu of Bitmain are both early investors and advisors to Elastos. Jihan Wu has committed to redirecting hashing power from Bitcoin mining to Elastos. G3 is a co-operation between **NEO**, **Elastos** and **Bitmain** who share a vision of a decentralized economy and smart web. Key features of the smart web include the virtual machine, runtime environments and trust zone, provided by Elastos and Bitmain, consensus provided by NEO and KYC provided by Ontology.\n\nG3 is meant to cooperate with Chinese government regulations and considering two of the leading figures of Chinese blockchain are involved (Jihan Wu and Da Hongfei), the likelihood that these projects will greatly succeed when the Chinese adopt crypto-friendly regulations is very, very high. China appears poised to change their cryptocurrency regulations soon: http://news.8btc.com/chinese-scholar-china-to-release-new-policy-on-cryptocurrency-and-ico-in-2018\n\n**How is the ELA token used?**\n\nELA tokens have a low coin supply, only 33 million in total will ever exist. Circulating supply is 6.5 million according to Huobi, but because of the 1-3 year token lockup program Elastos has introduced that number is expected to decrease (see: https://medium.com/@elastos/elastos-token-distribution-mechanism-position-locking-and-return-plan-acaa015592ef). Locking your ELA tokens generates annual return rates of between 4-6% depending on the amount of time you elect to lock your tokens for. Refer to link above for more details.\n\nELA tokens are mined using 'shared mining' with Bitcoin which means ELA mining piggybacks on Bitcoin mining. Essentially, no additional resources are used to mine ELA (which is important environmentally). ELA will be a staking token in later 2018. ELA holders will receive airdrops of all coins created on the Elastos ecosystem which they refer to as \u2018sugar dividends\u2019, there are more details to be released on this but further reading can be found in the white paper as well as: https://twitter.com/fayliela/status/959909521756848128, https://medium.com/@elastos/ecosystem-collaboration-governance-reward-mechanism-690d1adf331b\n\nAny tokens generated on Elastos will be required to lock 2-5% of their total token supply in ELA. This is huge considering dApps by companies as massive as Zapya (400m users), Huawei, Alibaba, and the unnamed massive gaming company (as well as more to come which has been hinted at many times by Elastos team) will need to generate their own tokens on Elastos or utilize ELA for transaction fees and creating digital assets on the Elastos blockchain.\n\n**Resources**\n\n- https://medium.com/@elastos/beyond-ethereum-the-future-evolution-of-blockchain-6b9a9c8a9d68\n\n- https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/elastos/\n\n- https://www.elastos.org/static/file/elastos_whitepaper_0.2.pdf\n\n*Where to buy?*\n\n$ELA is purchasable on Huobi\n",

Combining the safety and structure of a publicly listed stock with the decentralized ease and peace of mind in having full control over your funds, Cross-Fi is here to change the game, with the Uniswap GCAC Token pair being the first to ever be released.\n\nThrough a buy-back schedule, in which the publicly listed company agrees to buy a number of tokens worth a certain percentage of their net revenue per quarter, Cross-Fi tokens will provide you the opportunity of exposure to a company\u2019s performance, as you would get in the stock market, but crucially through the familiar face of Uniswap. You can HODL, safe in the knowledge that your funds are yours and yours alone.\n\nAdditionally, as with any public company, full disclosure of intent is required before any selling of tokens is carried out. The contract creators have placed within the contract, a necessity to have explicitly disclosed to the public the intent of the contract creator to sell tokens, or even to redeem tokens from the liquidity pool. This, combined with the fact the contract does not let the contract owner transfer funds to other wallets, guarantees that a rug-pull cannot happen. To reiterate, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO RUG-PULL due to the smart contract.\n\nGCAC is paving the way for HODLers to get the best of both worlds.\n\nCheck it out at [https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xf22645743415d8C06D78C8A4F0eA214041b4544F](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xf22645743415d8C06D78C8A4F0eA214041b4544F)",

Recently merged with yEarn finance and integrated v1 & v2 vaults. Akropolis will serve as institutional player engagement and business development in yEarn DeFi ecosystem. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a2txpaaocmr61.png?width=2394&format=png&auto=webp&s=722a456bceb76b04ea94af952cd111e2f65d3622\n\n# What is Akropolis:\n\nAkropolis is a DeFi yield farming and Dollar Cost Averaging (coming soon) tool that offers synthetic savings and high yield \u201caccounts\u201d aimed at DeFi-curious users with no deep technical knowledge and some understanding of Ethereum and crypto. Akropolis was built by the Akropolis team and is the second product built on AkropolisOS.\n\n# DCA (in progress):\n\nDollar-cost average is a popular strategy in traditional finance and the crypto community. To put it simply - it is automated, periodic purchases of an asset (commonly referred to as \u201cstacking sats\u201d in BTC community). Regardless of the asset, the DCA strategy has always been to invest periodically (weekly, monthly, etc) in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase price/cost basis. The purchases occur regardless of the price and at regular intervals. DCA effectively removes much of the headache that comes with attempts to time the market in order to buy an asset at the best prices.\n\n# Yield Farming:\n\nCurrently AKRO staking offers 37% APY. Rewards are vested for one year, which in my opinion is extremely good, because stops whales from dumping their rewards and drop the price. You are unlocking part of them every day, so 1/365. Once you reach 10K AKRO unlocked rewards they will be send to your wallet, distributions happens twice a month, every two weeks.\n\n# Yearn Vaults:\n\nOn the Vaults tab you can find the Yearn strategies v1&v2 integrated. This is the automised product to maximase your yield-farming gains.\n\n# yEarn Merger: post-merger AKRO Tokenomics:\n\n\\- AKRO will stand to accrue a TVL referral fee on funds that enter yEarn vaults/pools through our UI.\n\n\\- The yEarn team is focused on the underlying vaults and aims to become a provider of vaults-as-a-service.\n\n\\- Many other aspects outside of the core tech, such as business development, regulatory and other issues are outside of the focus of the core team and something that we can take on, where our natural strength lies as a wider team.\n\n\\- Conversely, we benefit from close technical collaboration, leveraging the standartised tech stack, unified security processes, and the wider yEarn ecosystem.\n\n\\- AKRO holders will also receive revenue share via fees from our native yield-generating products.\n\n\\- New yield generating products are currently in the R&D phase and they will represent a distinct product set outside of the vault space.\n\n\\- AKRO acts as a governance token for the parameters mentioned below:\n\n\\- Product features and integrations;\n\n\\- Fees;\n\n\\- Propose new Vault strategy;\n\n\\- Propose Vault strategy selection/creation framework.",

I purchase $50 BTC, $50 ETH, $10-$25 in XLM, ADA, ALGO and IOTA as well. I honestly just want to hear some feedback on your success stories, or recommendations. \n\nI hold BTC, ETH and XLM on CoinBase PRO and I hold ADA, ALGO and IOTA on Binance. My favorite of the two is CoinBase PRO. I would hold most my coins on there but unfortunately not all are available on there. I do not use any wallets and honestly the wallets confuse the heck out of me. So any links and info on them would be amazing.\n\nAny feedback in general would be amazing. Let me hear your thoughts on the coins that I have chosen too. I have done my own research, despite the fact that its all still difficult to understand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks everyone!

            "text": "*There\u2019s often a tension in the crypto world between security and convenience. That trade-off is unacceptable if we want these technologies to be widely used. Here\u2019s how Ergo addresses one common and very important issue.*\n\nWe all know that the most secure way to use Bitcoin, or any crypto, is to download a copy of the blockchain and run a full node yourself. That way, every time you or anyone else makes a transaction, your client checks the blockchain to ensure it\u2019s valid. You don\u2019t have to trust anyone else.\n\nA full Bitcoin node checks all the blocks in the blockchain (using headers) and makes sure there are no fraudulent transactions. It\u2019s a very secure way of using crypto \u2013 but there\u2019s a problem. It requires significant bandwidth, storage and processing power. That kind of commodity hardware is expensive, and using a full node to validate and make transactions is in any case unsuitable for mobile devices. This is particularly true for Bitcoin, where the blockchain is over 270 GB and counting.\n\nSPV\n\nSimplified Payment Verification (SPV) is designed to address this problem, as described in the Bitcoin white paper:\n\n* *It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.*\n\nSatoshi notes that this is not a perfect solution, and is vulnerable to an attacker overpowering the network and fooling SPV users.\n\nMoreover, while SPV mode is intended for resource-limited devices, even this \u2018lite\u2019 approach is not always feasible. Ethereum\u2019s headers alone total around 5 GB to download. Thus Ethereum mobile clients do not validate chain validity and so blindly have to trust third parties.\n\nThere are proposals to reduce the requirements for SPV mode by checking just a few random headers, instead of all of them. But it\u2019s hard to do that securely.\n\nEfficient SPV\n\nSeveral years have been spent researching and developing secure protocols that allow for efficient SPV clients. The two best-known and most reliable protocols are NiPoPoWs and FlyClient.\n\nErgo implements NiPoPoWs, or Non-interactive Proof-of-Proof-of-Work. This technology can be explored in full on this dedicated website: https://nipopows.com:\n\n* *Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs) are short stand-alone strings that a computer program can inspect to verify that an event happened on a proof-of-work-based blockchain without connecting to the blockchain network and without downloading all block headers. For example, these proofs can illustrate that a cryptocurrency payment was made.*\n* *NIPoPoWs allow very efficient mobile wallets to be created.* *SPV wallets* *are already very lightweight compared to full nodes because they only require the download of block headers, not the whole blockchain. NIPoPoW wallets need to download only a small* ***sample*** *of block headers, around 250, when SPV clients need to download half a million block headers. The sample needed changes but doesn't grow much in size as the blockchain grows larger by the years, even after decades of data has been accumulated.*\n\nThis enables us to build a mobile SPV client that requires around **just 100KB** of block headers to be downloaded.\n\nA super-efficient Ergo wallet with SPV security is in development, so stay tuned for more updates!",

Maybe, you don't even like gaming and are just a crypto or NFT enthusiast looking for a fun community of people where you can learn, play, grow, and escape the neverending rat race of the world, at large? If any of this applies to you, then hou should check out Fractal Studios. \n\nWhat is Fractal Studios?\n\nFractal Studios, a new gaming company, is bringing an ingenious and unique vision to the cryptoverse. More than just a source of high quality games, Fractal Studios seeks to create an entire, online community that serves as an oasis from the daily stresses of the outside world. They are unlike any other project I have found. \n\nDiscord: So Much More Than You'd Think\n\nTheir Discord is already really impressive, featuring channels ranging from Gameroom, a free and addictive casino, to Crypto, a discussion channel, to Gif Wars, an often hysterical stream of consciousness in gif form.  There's a channel dedicated to music where folks share what's in their rotation, at the moment. And, this is only the beginning. The team is in the process of developing Fractal Studios\u2019 own Minecraft server, and one of the coolest things in the works is a mining method that revolves around education and answering questions!\n\nRandom Rules!\n\nThe team embraces the principles of chaos, and this is reflected  throughout Fractal Studios, but nowhere is it as apparent as in the unorthodox behavior of their token\u2019s redistribution airdrops. Random (RNDM) is the native token for the Fractal Studios ecosystem. Built on the Binance Smart Chain network, RNDM, at first glance, looks like many other deflationary tokens, but the similarity soon gives way to stark contrasts.\nEvery Random transaction incurs a 3% fee. 66% of that (2%) goes to the redistribution wallet, and 33% (1%) goes to the burn wallet. The redistributions will be randomized amounts that fall within a set range. So, you'll always receive your redistribution reward, but it could be a different amount every time! It's almost like a lottery every time!\n\nPlans\n\nFractal Studios has other exciting developments in the works. One is a randomized, ultra-rare NFT generator, which will be launching later this year. They have a clear roadmap including listings on larger exchanges. \n\nSummary \n\nFractal Studios is truly one of the most exciting projects to come along in a while, IMO. I am invested. I'm not a wealthy man, but I feel confident in the success of the project. It has a fully doxxed, transparent team, and it's a cool idea that i think is exactly what crypto needs. \n\nTheir pre-sale launched today. DYOR. Check them out for yourself.\n\nhttps://rndmtoken.com",

Get on your everyday exchange and either convert some other crypto you have to USDC or buy some with FIAT. If you buy it with FIAT, you may not be able to withdraw it right away due to the exchange putting a hold on incoming FIAT deposits.\n2. Transfer your newly minted USDC to your wallet.\n3. CLOSE OUT OF YOUR EXCHANGE BEFORE MOVING FORWARD. This is important to do before using a VPN, I have heard stories (especially from Coinbase) where people have been locked out of their account because they accessed it from an IP outside of the US. I don't know if this is true or not, but better safe than sorry, right?!\n4. Fire up that VPN and connect to some other country (I always connect through Brazil). This is required because non-KYC exchanges are not accessible to US based customers (to my knowledge).\n5. Navigate to the non-KYC exchange. I use Poloniex, it was a little funky to do so. I received a prompt on the main page once I logged in asking me to put in my State of residence. I selected my state and moved on. It hasn't given me any issues.\n6. Send a small amount of USDC from your wallet to the exchange, as a test to make sure it goes through.\n7. Once you verify that the transfer was completed successfully, you can send the rest.\n8. Use the exchange to convert the USDC you transferred to XRP. You will have to do a limit buy, so pay attention to the current pricing.\n9. Once your order goes through, you will have XRP on the exchange. Congrats!\n10. You can either leave it on the exchange or transfer it back into your wallet for safe HODLing.\n\nI hope this helps anyone who is looking buy and HODL XRP living in the US. You could just use Robinhood I suppose, but you don't actually own the currency and screw Robinhood for their shady business practices.\n\nNote: If you use both your mobile device and a PC, you can directly transfer from your KYC exchange to the non KYC exchange. Just use the VPN on one or the other.\n\nIf anyone has any questions or suggestions, post them below. I'll do my best to help out!",

In today's blog entry, I talk about those factors, as well as how I see XRP diverging from Bitcoin's market leading dominance.  \n\nFor Ripple and XRP, it's been nonstop good news over the last four days, with the big news being the anticipated release of the MoneyTap application by the Japanese Banking Consortium (JBC).  I discuss the details behind this application plus I have some surprises about possible business deals you might not know about.  It includes the partial acquisition of a hardware wallet company by SBI, the addition of XRP to the BitIT marketplace, a Grayscale investment fund specifically targeting XRP, and the rumor of Ripple technology underlying a deal between Saison and Grab.  \n\nRounding out the list is an update for those in the XRP community eagerly awaiting the release of the Kyte wallet!  \n\nI hope you enjoy - please leave any feedback below.  \n\nThank you & sincerely,\n-Hodor",

            "text": "I am currently invested in 4 ICOs that have yet to release their tokens. ICOs are unique in the sense that they provide a way to \u201clock up\u201d funds for a period of time (usually 2 months). When the token hits the exchange you usually (if the ICO is successful) have a nice pump, and within 4 months it is trading between 500%-1000% above your ICO price. Normally once it hits the first exchange it is already trading 200% above the ICO price. The harder aspect is trying to predict successful ICOs. However, with a ROI at 500%-1000% you only have to be correct about 1/5 to be successful. Our goal is not to be 1/5 but to be 5/5. Analyzing the whitepaper, the team, the roadmap, where they are in development, partnerships, and existing products are all invaluable aspects to an ICO. Through significant analysis I\u2019ve found my January plays which are listed below:\n\nFor a referral link for any of these ICOs please PM me! Regardless if you use the referral these I highly recommend!\n\n\nHireMatch \u2013  Monster meets the blockchain! They were at the Miami BTC conference and this is truly a fantastic concept. Hiring agencies have taken the internet by storm and assuming blockchain breaks into all sectors of business, the hiring sector is next! This is also a great ICO for U.S. based investors. They are located in Sunnyvale, CA. While the founders have significant experience in the hiring realm being the creators of Recruiter.com and other major recruitment agencies. Their coin symbol is HIRE and their ICO sale is ending fairly soon! With a very well connected team, already formed partnerships, and the ability for U.S. based investors to take place this is has potential to be a great coin! Referral link removed, contact for it please :).\n\n\nIungo- \u201cAIRBNB for internet access.\u201d It lets an individual or business owner rent out the access of their internet. This ICO reached its soft cap VERY quickly and is within $5 million of its hard cap. This will only be recommended for the 2 or 3 days prior to reaching the hard cap. With the soft cap achieved already, the ability to rent out your internet being fairly revolutionary, and less than 1 week left in the ICO sale, this is a very intriguing play. Imagine being able to regularly rent out the use of your router when you weren\u2019t home, or when your business was closed but the router was still on. This is a very cool use of the blockchain and provides many with a new side income! Referral link removed, contact for it please :).\n\n\nSTORIQA: \u201cThe Amazon Cryptocurrency Marketplace\u201d. Great team, great platform, easy to sign up for ICO (even for U.S. investors). Well past their soft cap and approaching their hard cap! Discount for bonus coins still available in the short term! This has been on and off of my rec list but because they are approaching their hard cap I figured I\u2019d give everyone one last opportunity to sign up! Referral link removed, contact for it please :).\n\nKYC Legal: Know Your Customer (the dreaded KYC form). If you\u2019ve completed an ICO recently you know the form I\u2019m talking about. The form they give you at the end, after you\u2019ve sent your .5eth but before they will release their tokens. Basically stating you understand this market is unregulated, etc. Well a blockchain token has in essence solved this problem. I HATE KYC forms and if the KYC system was set up in a way in which you wouldn\u2019t have to fill out that form repeatedly for every ICO it would be more convenient for all investors and ICO companies. KYC Legal intends to do just that. According to the founder DR, \u201cThis is a simple and quick way to complete client identification procedures, which can then be used to verify the client\u2019s identity during various financial operations (so-called KYC (\u201cknow your customer\u201d) requirements that financial institutions and companies working with the money of private individuals use to identify and verify counterparties before starting a financial transaction). This niche is completely untapped and I HATE KYC forms enough to think this is a brilliant idea. They are calling it a \u201cUniversal alternative to Personal IDs,\u201d on the block chain. Brilliant concept and there are 2 days left to receive the 38% discount from the final price. A 38% gain prior to token sale completion is significant, imagine what will happen when the hard cap is reached and it hits the first exchange. Referral link removed, contact for it please :).\n\nThis sums up my favorite 4 ICOs that are completing in the next few days. I would highly recommend (as I have) to get involved in them to keep your ETH safe during these fluctuations and almost have a guaranteed % increase 2 months from now. Always stay diversified, do not be in all alts, ICOs, or the CB options. Always have a rotating diversified portfolio!\n\nIt looks like the market has finally taken a positive turn! I was expecting this following the 3 rounds of FUD attacks (South Korea, China, and India). Unfortunately, it took a few days longer than expected. The one outlier date that exists this week is the second round of options expiring. The options traders (institutional money) crashed the market intentionally last week and this may repeat itself this week. If they do crash it again I would recommend scooping up the cheapest alts you believe in as they will rebound with much more ferocity than BTC. They are using their institutional money to play GOD and manipulate but you can easily counter this by grabbing cheap alts and enjoying the significant rebound that occurs following these market crashes and FUD attacks. There are more conferences beginning in 3 days (London) followed by San Francisco, Manilla, Singapore, Dallas, etc. The market may have corrected in January, especially with 3 rounds of FUD and option traders crashing it. However, this correction was healthy for a market cap that increased 40% in under 2 months. Following a correction, it takes the crypto market 5-60 days to reach new all-time highs (based on past events). With the conferences I think we will do it more quickly than 60 days. Only time will tell but we are in the rebound and this should be a great 2 months, even with the occasional FUD.\n\n\n(STRAT, ICX, NEO, TRX, BRD, MTL, NEO, SC, RDD)\n\nSTRAT: We should receive our positive news in the next 72hrs! A new flagship ICO and being able to examine their ICO platform! STRAT is very inactive on twitter but their founder last week insinuated this week will be HUGE. The market recovery today and tomorrow should place STRAT in a perfect place to release positive news this week. I expect STRAT to break $20, possibly $25 following their news this week! ETH was $1 at presale a year ago, STRAT will be a worthy competitor for ETH within 3 months. \n\nICX: I\u2019ve been on this Korean sensation for almost 3 weeks now! This is the week! Mainnet release is on the 25th at the largest building (skyscraper) in Seoul for a conference that ICX is hosting. The South Korean govt. just went from FUD attacks to almost full support. Their timing couldn\u2019t be better for our little ICX! GO ICX GO! This is your week!\n\nNEO: China\u2019s ETH, it is unfortunate China has taken such a negative stance on cryptos (publicly). The rumors swirling is that they are about to flip flop on their stance. All those huge mining pools in China that were allegedly \u201cshut down\u201d it turns out (rumors) that they were taken over by the state. It seems China is about to be one of the largest miners of crypto in the world (the actual govt.). I doubt they will continue to combat crypto but instead will begin to embrace it as it makes the government very wealthy. NEO is hosting DevCon in 2 weeks and is paying GAS on Binance on the 1st. NEO is a must own leading into DevCon and GAS! I expect the Chinese to relax their restrictions as the rumors swirling are the opposite of what our lovely news agencies are cramming down our throats (FUD). With relaxed restrictions, DevCon, and GAS, NEO wins.\n\nTRX: They announced today their BETA would be out March 29th. For a coin that so many people love to hate, I\u2019m beginning to love to love them. They are a great coin for day trading with huge fluctuations, and they seem to be continuing their development even with all the public pressure and FUD. With a game coming out on the horizon and their BETA launch, I\u2019m very excited to own, and day trade TRX. (Binance)\n\nBRD: New wallet features being unlocked this month using the BRD token, breadcrumbs being sprinkled around events ($50-$1000 in BTC on each one!), and sponsoring 2 of the next 5 events make this an easy winner for February. The publicity between new wallet features, adding purpose to the BRD token, and huge sponsorships should give this coin the launch pad to end in every portfolio (and on the moon!). I can see BRD being a $5 token by the end of February.\n\nMTL: They were delisted from Bittrex basically for being lazy. The Dev team is still hard at work on their platform even though Bittrex gave them until January 1st. They missed their deadline and were delisted. Their delisting and the market correction place this coin in a perfect place for a rebound. Their Dev team has promised to release their platform in Q1, at that point a coin most had lost hope in will explode onto the scene. Bittrex even stated they would relist them if they complete their platform, etc. MTL should have one of the best Q1s out of any coin that isn\u2019t listed to CB.\n\nSC: Siacoin is on Bittrex and going through a hard fork. With Bittrex also opening up to new registrants, SC is in a perfect spot to have a flood of money into it. Many big traders are hypothesizing the coins specifically on Bittrex will pop when they open their gates back up to the masses. This speaks very well for low priced options with great tech, and going through hard forks to improve (SC). This also speaks volumes to coins like RDD which are some of the cheapest on Bittrex and are great for day trading!\n\nMoonshots!!!! I haven\u2019t listed a Moonshot in a while because the market has been in the toilet for 3 weeks \u201ccorrecting\u201d and dealing with FUD. I have a few moonshots I am analyzing and hope to have one ready for release by the end of the week! For now, the play is to accumulate low priced alts on KuCoin/Binance/Bittrex (KuCoin is the best for moons!) as most have fallen 50-75% from 2 weeks prior. Please PM if you\u2019d like to know about specific KuCoin coins, have suggestions for educational aspects incorporated into daily reports or for specific referral links!\n",

Joining platforms like DIFX, where you can buy stocks or forex with crypto, or with a non-custodial wallet like eFin, making your cryptocurrency exchange journey user-friendly. And if you want to start mining cryptocurrencies, there\u2019s companies like Mining City, that will guide you to take your first steps into your mining journey.

In the cryptocurrency space, Bitcoin has shown to be a Unicorn asset. However, as we move more into the technology space of cryptocurrency we can see that ATS wallet is adopting new security and functionality integrations that are paving the way companies in the space act.\n \nAs more people start to use cryptocurrencies, we need better ways to not only consume them but to purchase them and make cryptocurrency easily accessible. Before ATS wallet cryptocurrency users were forced to use dodgy exchange sites and hard to use graphical interphases. However, with ATS users are easily able to transact with cryptocurrencies from their phone with easy user interphases. Someone with little to no knowledge of cryptocurrencies can quickly start interacting with them as the wallet holds multiple functionalities. \nTo be a unicorn ATS wallet would need to have multiple integrations that make cryptocurrency life simple and easy to interact with. Let\u2019s go over the different services that ATS has in one transparent location.\nWallet\nCryptocurrency wallets have been around since the start of Bitcoin, however ATS conveniently allows users to interact with crypto in a completely new way. ATS has FDIC insurance so that if a user has crypto stolen, there is insurance to help offset the losses. This allows mainstream users to download the wallet as they won\u2019t need to worry about crypto being stolen.\n \nExchange\nNot only can you store multiple cryptocurrencies, but you can now exchange them all in one transparent place. You can use ATS to hold your cryptocurrency, and then actively trade it with a click of a button. Anyone who owns cryptocurrency can now become a trader without an expert knowledge of maker/taker fees.\n \nMasternode\nStaking your cryptocurrency can be scary on your own due to the irreversible nature of the blockchain. However, ATS wallet has made it easy to interact with your cryptocurrency using an inhouse masternode. You can now earn 90% interest on your DASH coins, and soon more crypto will be added to the list. Staking and running a masternode has never been easier with the ATS wallet.\n \nBefore the wallet, only experts in the cryptocurrency field could stake their assets. However, ATS has completely changed the ball game and are allowing anyone to participate in the ecosystem.",

            "text": "Adapting the Legacy Financial Industry to Meet Growing Customer Demand for Crypto-Currencies  \npapersheepdog  \n  \nThe world is becoming increasingly comfortable with Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies as we have had time to put them to the test, while regulations are helping to create greater certainty. We must look forward to understand the next big steps which will allow us to truly bring this technology to the masses. Gold and Silver are called honest money for a reason, and it's the same reason that you can apply to crypto-currencies; they pay special favor to no one. They can be stored in a safe, or removed and sent across the world in minutes. We are now able to create decentralized trading markets which put buyers in direct contact with sellers. The value of this is understood when looking at the recent \u201chigh frequency trading\u201d front-running scandal. Our society is technologically saturated and is ready to start building a more robust and decentralized economy. Technologies like 3-D printing, crypto-currencies and wireless mesh networks are showing us what is possible.  \n  \nIn order to try to uncover some of this potential, we will explore some nuances of the old ways and the new ways of doing business. Today, we trust the central banks to not use their ability to print money in an unfair way, but it's simply human nature to exploit unfair advantage. Decentralized crypto-currencies are strictly controlled by a protocol which does not allow for the arbitrary creation, or printing, of money. When you swipe a credit card, money is created which did not exist beforehand, and you are on the hook for it as debt. This fractional reserve banking is what allows up to 30 debtors to be burdened for every dollar in actual reserve holdings. In the new way, money can only come from a wallet with funds in it, and anyone can accept it with virtually no cost. A simple internet connection is required and the recipient must be able to display their wallet address either on paper or screen.  \n  \nLike every new technology, it will take the population a long time to truly understand it. The freedom to interact with each other in boundless, and yet fair new ways is what will drive the demand for these cryptographic blockchain technologies. However, freedom always comes with responsibility. Today's financial system totally depends on centralized trust to store and transact our savings. The trade off for convenience of security is that you don't actually control your money (and it doesn't technically exist). Even still in this new crypto-landscape we are trying to find excuses for holding our money in centralized locations like Mt. Gox, an exchange that lost half a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin in what appears to be criminal fraud which could no more be blamed on Bitcoin than on the precious metal if it was Gold that had been stolen.  \n  \nEquity, capital, foreign exchange, derivative markets, multi-party contracts, even entire companies can be established and controlled using existing decentralized peer-to-peer cryptographic technologies. Currencies are just the proof of concept for these more complex cryptographic trustless accounting and organization systems. We have to expect that this will be an evolution and that those already best suited to meet and profit from demand will do so. It appears that central banking is realizing its conclusion, but this does not mean an end to banks. A re-balancing will occur which returns transparency, accountability, and control away from the concentrations of power, and new relationships will be forged which don't require trust in the banks to verify. The transition period will require institutions which allow capital flow between the debt based fiat currencies and the new crypto-currencies and assets. These same institutions would also be well positioned to offer services to simplify spending, accepting, and saving of crypto-currencies.  \n  \nOne of the services related to spending is market access to legacy financial products, including foreign exchange of central bank issued currencies, as well as to other digital crypto-currencies. The other service to support spending would be mobile apps and online portals which utilize proprietary infrastructure to execute requested actions. These apps would also facilitate the receipt of funds to businesses and individuals while providing security services to increase privacy in a transparent manner. Growing demand is also apparent for services which facilitate storage of savings including physical and information security, secure printing and delivery of private keys at request, customer-verified segregated funds, and advanced crypto-currency functions like claiming interest. These services will combine to provide the masses with the simplicity of banking that they are familiar with, and the benefits that are inherent to crypto-currencies.  \n  \nAs momentum builds and the technology is better understood, we are seeing a progression in the quality and trust-worthiness of services being provided. After enduring the uncertainty of such businesses like Mt. GoX, a company that employed 10 people and got its start in the fantasy card game business, the industry as a whole is finally becoming better capitalized and regulated. The smaller, more agile businesses may soon be losing their edge as larger institutions become more comfortable operating within the guidelines and regulations now being put forth by government. It is a matter of time before unbelievably cheap bank accounts, denominated in crypto-currencies, are offered to customers on a massive scale. This is an opportunity for well-capitalized institutions to prove to their customers that they are determined to remain relevant as these new technologies and services emerge to meet growing demand.

I know a lot of Altcoins and ICOS/Tokens are scams or busts, and that the market itself in general right now is hard to predict or form a  strategy off of because it fluctuates so much and is hard to gather true facts or data from what I have read up on. **whether the last sentence is true or not I am not sure of myself truthfully, second hand resource.**\n\nI am on the following few subreddits daily trying to filter through the garbage and gather any intellectual insight or exceptional opinions backed by sources or logical reasoning,\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTrade/\n\n\n\nNow with all of that being said, I have $3,000.00 USD to put into the market today and can invest daily moving forward as well if I wish or desire to when I see dips or good quick sells.  Money definitely does not grow on trees, but it is also far from a concern for me.\n\nI'm not familiar at all really with transaction fees or how/where I should be buying coins from, then transferring to, or where I should be storing, where/how I can buy Altcoin if I want, and all of that management/organizational jazz. **I am always a student and willing to learn if you have wisdom or can help me with this, oh teachers. *humble bow***\n\n\n**Summary comes to Resolution and Question:**\n\nI would appreciate only intellectual and positive contribution, feedback, and responses please.\n\nDo you think I should just put  all **$3k USD** into *BTC* right now and just hodl it until after the fork and sell off the 2x free coin for Altcoins and ICOs as they will be pumped in the cycle once BTC is finished being pumped?\n\nDo you think I should reasonably expect or see a dip from the current upwards trend with BTC right now and then just throw it all down then before the fork when that happens?\n\nShould I play around with other tokens in the market and bank some high ROI waiting for the dip before the fork (if even a dip) and then swap for BTC and hodl?\n\n\nI am looking to learn as well as to contribute what knowledge I have researched and I am wanting to make smart strategic moves naturally.\n\nReally hoping to find some people with years of experience in this field along with help I need to begin this adventure of what I know will only be a **success.**\n\n\nNice to meet you all upfront! =)",

                    "response": "I entered back in 2013 so I have some breathing room. I see it as inevitable that two things will happen. One is immediately after the fork, people will be frothing at the mouth to get back into alts. I therefore decided to invest in many alts at these cheap prices, not so concerned about \"free money\" from Bitcoin gold. HOWEVER, right now, more and more people are entering the market. I sincerely see Bitcoin as the buzz, the stepping stone into crytpocurrency. I doubt many people will start out buying NEO or Loopring. I will say therefore that it is important to hodl mostly bitcoin and ethereum in general because as I said, it's almost a given that future crypto traders will start out with these. For now I'd say keeping the majority in these 2 is very wise. That being said, I intend to buy back into bitcoin after the fork, gambling on having more by buying in after the mass selloff that I see as a given. Please don't necessarily do this, it is just my gut feeling, research your options. I would also advise looking into using Binance for a allocated portion of your funds as an exchange, they have quality coins, and the binance coin is doing a profit sharing coin burn in the next couple of days. Walton, chainlink, kyber and binance have all done very well for me, so this is just one random person so look into all this yourself. Another interesting lead is to get NEO, as far as I know, they are the only coin that has a wallet (Neon) that let's you simply hit a button to collect free gas just for using it. Normally you have to stake a wallet leaving a computer on 24-7 to receive free dividends. In fact, you can turn around and sell back your gas on binance for more Neo, pretty cool. I know people will downvote this because there tends to be lot's of Neo hate, I just see it as a solid investment. One last point is that it is extremely addictive to \"day trade.\" Keep in mind with exchanges, they charge you transaction fees, so every time you trade you are spending money. Also it's very important to know the fundamentals of a coin and to understand the use cases to see if it will be fruitful. Cheers.",

            "text": " I wanted to write this short guide to let you all know what I\u2019ve learned so far in the three months since beginning my Crypto journey. I\u2019ve learned some difficult lessons and want to help the community learn from my mistakes coming from the USA.\n\n1. Where/how to buy crypto - I would only buy from the crypto.com app because when you sign up for an account, there are zero fees for purchasing crypto with USD for a month. Even after the month is up it\u2019s still the cheapest option for buying crypto (2.99%) that I\u2019ve found. You can link your credit card to the marketplace and buy directly and it\u2019s instant.\n2. Selling crypto - Although crypto.com app is great for buying and cashing out (more on that later), it\u2019s absolutely horrible for trading. They say that there are zero fees but that\u2019s a bunch of crap. They take their cut first and then give you what they tell you (they say it\u2019s free but at least they are up-front about how much you actually receive after the sale). I know this because when you sell your crypto for USDC, the USDC amount received should be very close to the same amount as what your crypto is worth. When you actually sell for USDC the value of your crypto in your wallet goes down by a good chunk. So what should you do? There are many great crypto markets out there that are extremely cheap to buy and sell, my favorite being Kucoin. Kucoin lets you buy and sell to your heart\u2019s content and you can set the price for buying and selling and that order is good until fulfilled. What\u2019s more, the fee to trade is only .1%! That\u2019s only $1 per $1000 traded. To put that in perspective, I sold my SHIB on Crypto this morning and they took like $40 from $440 worth of the coin. Also, no need to do KYC because you're not going to cash out with them. You can still trade to your heart's content without verification.\n3. Withdrawing crypto (not cashing out) - So how would I go about getting a coin off of crypto.com and sending it to Kucoin? I would highly suggest buying Harmony (ONE) or Stellar (XLM) and then sending it over. The reason for this is that the withdrawal fee for those two coins are .008 and .1 respectively. For Harmony, it\u2019s less than a penny! Make sure that you send a test withdrawal first just to make sure that it goes through. To do this, open up your Kucoin app, click on assets tab, then click on \u201cDeposit\u201d. Select the coin you would like to receive and copy the address given. This is Kucoin\u2019s wallet address for that coin. Remember that there is a different address for each coin listed on Kucoin so copy each time. On the crypto.com wallet, go to the coin you would like to withdraw, click \u201cWithdraw\u201d, and then click on the + symbol to add the Kucoin wallet. Paste the address and name it Kucoin \u201cand name of the coin\u201d, then click on \u201cadd\u201d. Crypto.com will send a confirmation to your email which you will have to approve. Now you wait for crypto.com to send you a confirmation that the transaction was sent then after a short while, Kucoin will let you know you have the added funds in your account. Once you have confirmed the coin was successfully deposited, now send the rest (no need to copy the address again since it\u2019s saved in your crypto.com wallet).\n4. Trading crypto - Once you have a coin on Kucoin or similar, you can now trade! Marketplaces like Kucoin have different accounts such as \u201cMain\u201d and \u201cTrading\u201d. When you transfer a coin to Kucoin you must click on the coin you would like to trade and transfer it to your \u201cTrading\u201d account. Once that\u2019s done you can find the coin you want to trade (I recommend always trading in USDT where possible because it\u2019s so much easier to find out the current value of the coin in USD). To trade, be sure to be in the \u201cSpot\u201d tab, then in the \u201cLimit\u201d section, enter in the price you would like to sell at (assuming you want to sell the coin you just deposited once at a certain price), then on the line beneath it you will select the amount of coins you would like to sell (there are percentages beneath that you can select that will autofill depending on the amount you have available), then select \u201cSell\u201d. You do the same thing for buying with USDT. I would recommend adding any coins you want to trade often to your \u201cFavorites\u201d by selecting the star in the top right. Also, make sure that you select your own currency in the settings tab of Kucoin so you aren't dealing in Yuan.\n5. Cashing out of Crypto - Once you\u2019ve made about 200% profit, feel free to cash out by sending crypto to the crypto.com app because they supposedly don\u2019t charge anything to withdraw. You can only take out 100k per month though (I know, I know, so little!). To do so, click on the middle lion looking icon at the bottom of the app, then click \u201cFiat Wallet\u201d, and set up a USD wallet by selecting your currency. Then link your bank account again like you did to buy crypto, select your bank, log in, and you\u2019re set. Now go to the coin you want to cash out of and select, \u201cSell\u201d, then click on \u201cfiat wallet\u201d to deposit the value to your bank account.\n6. Binance - Binance is the most popular exchange in the world. However, it is extremely limited to US residents. If there is a coin that you can only find on Binance then I would set up a Canadian VPN and log into the Bincance marketplace on the desktop and trade really quick, then withdraw the crypto to a marketplace that you don\u2019t need a VPN on. \n7. Research - One thing I like about crypto.com is the information and ranking that you can see when tracking coins. They have a web link that helps you find out more information about a given coin which is very helpful. Always do your research!\n\nHopefully, this wasn\u2019t too confusing to you. This was just something that I wanted to share because my wife can read this if anything happens to me. Good luck!",

The SEC denied the Bats BZX Exchange\u2019s proposed rule change hoping to allow trading of the Winklevoss\u2019 Bitcoin Trust shares, leading Peirce to say \u201cI believe that the proposed rule change satisfies the statutory standard and that we should permit BZX to list and trade this Bitcoin-based exchange-traded product,\u201d and that the decision \u201csends a strong signal that innovation is unwelcome in our markets.\u201d\n* The Law Commission of India published a report regarding the legal status of sports betting and gambling in the country, referencing cryptocurrencies. The report recognizes cryptocurrencies as a method of payment for betting and wagering.

            "text": "Here is my opinion on GRS value before and after the B2X fork:\n\nGRS will steadily increase to its ATH starting from 9th Nov, 2017; and after the Nov. fork (until the end of Dec) the price will skyrocket to 5 to 10 USD levels and beyond. Here are the few of the many reasons for my claim:\n\n1. On 9th Nov, 2017; Korean exchange upbit will allow new subscribers to its exchange. https://twitter.com/UPbitExchange/status/926253055288504320. Since 1st Nov, 2017; they had halted registration of new subscribers due to their server overload due to enormous public interest for registration. In the 1st week of their launch they already became the 2nd largest domestic exchange in Korea surpassing Coinone and Korbit (largest domestic exchange being Bithumb) https://upbit.com/service_center/notice?id=37. It is to be noted that upbit is first altcoin exchange in Korea which is run by kakao talk (a messenger like whatsapp used by 95% of korean people). People trust Kakao talk\u2019s products (unlike Bithumb which was hacked previously). GRS (being Asic Resistant and its amazing wallet infrastructure) held top position in terms of trading volume for significant amount of time on upbit and its interest in Korean people have increased a lot. Hence, expect a big increase in GRS trading volume starting from 9th Nov, 2017.\n\n2. Secondly, Upbit is launching GRS/KRW trading pair. Timeline is not given on their website but it is widely anticipated to be added soon. This is big news because in all the 3 popular Korean exchanges (bithumb, Korbit, coinone) there isn\u2019t any bitcoin pairing and Koreans in general are not very used to trading in bitcoin pairs. GRS/KRW trading pair will not only bring more volume to GRS but also will be much more convenient for traders. This trading pair could be coming any time from now.\n\n3. Bitcoin gold will soon be allowed to be withdrawn and/or to be traded on various exchanges very soon. https://www.fxempire.com/education/article/complete-guide-exchanges-support-bitcoin-gold-448791.It will be further sold for other established ASIC resistance coins such as GRS which has amazing wallet infrastructure already in place. Currently, there are security issues with its listing in many exchanges such as coinbase and other exchanges. Bgold is disliked by bitcoin community and lacks in development. It would take long time for it to reach to the same level as GRS is now.\n\n4. For people who have concerns if GRS could further reduce in value before the Nov. fork; It is to be noted that just in the past week; GRS reddit community has grown significantly. For instance, its reddit page\u2019s subscribers rose from 400 about 2800. It\u2019s market cap has skyrocketed from about few million USD to 50 million USD in a week. It, also recently, got media coverage which led to its further exposure to new people. Majority of the people, including me, are staunch believers in GRS technology are long term hodlers. Given this situation, I believe that it is not expected to dip further from its current levels.\n\n5. Lastly, I have been following many crypto traders who are suggesting to buy GRS (and other alts) before/around or right after the B2x fork because alts are expected to rise in value after that. However, you wouldn\u2019t be able to purchase alts right after the fork due to the issue of replay protection of B2X. You might end up losing all your bitcoins. https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-bogeyman-cometh-segwit2x-51-attack/. Moreover, there is a lot of confusion and fear among the bitcoin community as to which coin will be the real bitcoin and given the issues of replay protection (not been activated on B2x) along with Bitcoin cash claiming to be the real bitcoin. This could get pretty complex and bitcoin\u2019s value could collapse to extremely low levels. That means even if you get B2X; the combined value of BTC and B2X could be lower than the current bitcoin\u2019s price. Do you really want to take this chance or do you want to make significant gains through investing in people\u2019s coin\u2026your choice!\n\nThis is my humble opinion. If anyone disagree or would like to add more; i would love to hear for a constructive discussion",

Audit complete with flying colours. \n\nHaving already hit a $26m MC within the first four days, there is no stopping Karen coin. There are super committed holders (over 6500) with CMC and CG listing just and multiple marketing channels which include big influencer giveaways on Twitter, apparently big crypto Youtuber's have content coming up this weekend along with Poocoin banner ads and more. They have a massive reach on TikTok with over 53 million reach capabilities with their current influencers. \n\nTo be honest the most impressive thing i've noticed is the community support behind the project. Read their group chats like Telegram, the \" Karen Army \" as they call themselves is behind the project 100%. The devs are 100% transparent as well, with AMAs and and frequent, clear updates throughout the time. \n\nTo shed more light on the project it's 100% community owned with a very loyal following. Ownership was renounced and 100% of the LP tokens are burnt. Another big one I liked was the no pre-sale which usually is all purchased up by the dev's. They launched on PancakeSwap and advertised the launch across most of their channels. This way plenty of young investors got in early and have so far made a fortune on their small initial investments. I think this is a huge reason for their success. There are also use cases being created.\n\nThe tokenomics is good with their rate being a little lower than the rest. They have an 8% tax on every transaction instead of the usual 10% so there are lower entry and exit fees incentivising more trade incentive. So 4% is distributed to holders and the other 4% is put back into liquidity.\n\nBroken down simply:\n\n8% tax on every transaction.\n\n4% reflect earning passive income by holding for diamond hands that are a girl\u2019s best friend\n\n4% liquidity protecting against wild price fluctuations.\n\nTo sum it up:\n\n**-** 100% Anti-Carpet Pull\n\n\\- Tokenomics making it Anti-Big Fish\n\n\\- No pre-sale, launched directly on Pancake Swap for all to participate equally.\n\n\\- No dev wallets or dev assigned tokens prior to launch.\n\n\\- LP-tokens burnt ( not locked like most others which eventually become available to the devs )\n\n\\- Contract ownership renounced making it 100% community driven.\n\nJust a note that there have been a few other KAREN tokens that \u201claunched\u201d recently while these guys prepared their launch Token and project details below... This is definitely the O.G Karen Coin.\n\nWebsite: [karencointoken.com](https://karencointoken.com/)",

            "text": "[Venture Capital (VC) funds invest in startups that disrupt industries and reinvent the world we live in, generating billions of dollars in the process. As a result, it\u2019s remarkable to see how the world of venture capital itself has remained untouched by technology for so many years. However, the biggest limitation of the VC model is that VC funds are not liquid. For that reason, investing in the most exciting stage of tech startups is reserved only for those who can afford to \u201cforget\u201d about their capital for 5-10 years.](https://token.iconiqlab.com/)\n\nVenture Capital investment into the blockchain economy has remained rather constant between 2015 and 2016, with the technology attracting approximately $1 billion over the 2-year time frame.\n\nDespite experiencing a slight decrease in funding in the first 2 quarters of 2016, in the latter half of the year the technology managed to achieve encouraging figures; nearly 2x and 3x 2015 levels in Q3 and Q4 respectively.\n\n[Blockchain offers the opportunity of making VC funds liquid through asset tokenization. Asset tokenizing refers to taking illiquid assets, and issuing tradable tokens that give holders rights in these assets (\u201casset-backed tokens\u201d) \u2013 thereby giving them liquidity as the assets become tradable.](https://token.iconiqlab.com/)  \n\nWHY DO VCs INVEST IN BLOCKCHAIN?\n\nLiquidity\n\nIn comparison to traditional venture capital investments, cryptocurrencies are extremely liquid; typically, VC firms only really reap the fruits of their investment after several years \u2014 i.e. once one of their portfolio members sees an exit. In this case, however, VC\u2019s can invest in startups in the crypto-market and see their gains far quicker through ICOs, which will allow them to convert their tokens into Bitcoin or Ether, which can easily be exchanged for fiat currency through numerous platform like Coinbase.\n\nIconiq Lab accepts applications year round. Iconiq Lab is an Initial Coin Offer and Token Launch (\u201cICO\u201c) seed funding wallet and accelerator. They source, fund, develop and accelerate the best crypto, blockchain and technology startups to their own ICO.

SYMBOL mainnet is estimated to be launched by December 2020.\n\nIn   preparation for the launch, the company has announced 15 September   2020, as the start of Opt-in process for XEM holders who want to receive   SYMBOL token XYM upon launch.\n\nNEM made the [**announcement**](https://forum.nem.io/t/opt-in-date-announcement/25565?u=davidshaw)   on Tuesday, August 25. According to the announcement, XEM holders will   be able to Opt-in from the 15th September 2020 through their NEM  Wallet,  or from your NEM Mobile Wallet on their Android device. The  opt-in date  for iOS devices will be announced at a later date.\n\nThe initially announced date for Opt-in was September 7, but *\u201ca further 8 days have been allowed for testing and improvement of the UI/UX,\u201d* said NEM.\n\nHow Will Opt-in Work?\n\nOpt-in   is the method by which existing XEM holders can claim their XYM tokens   at the point of Snapshot, prior to the new chain launch of SYMBOL. The   snapshot will be a picture that will be taken before the launch of   SYMBOL from NEM recording everyone\u2019s XEM balance across the NEM   blockchain.\n\nThis picture will then be used to populate the new [**SYMBOL (XYM) tokens**](https://crypto-economy.com/the-nem-foundations-symbol-is-approaching-how-it-will-be-distributed-to-nem-holders/)   in the new SYMBOL blockchain. The value of XYM is a 1:1 value of XEM.   XEM holders who do not Opt-in will not receive any XYM token.\n\nOpt-in   will also be allowed after the launch of SYMBOL From NEM. According to   the announcement, XEM holders can claim their XYM tokens for up to 6   years after the launch date. The details for post-launch opt-in will be   available at a later time.\n\nSYMBOL Launch\n\nSYMBOL   From NEM is a new a next-generation, open-source decentralized   blockchain platform from NEM with its own native token XYM. SYMBOL will   operate separately alongside the original NEM NIS1 chain.\n\nThe   SYMBOL testnet was launched on January 10, 2020. The initially planned   date for the mainnet launch was 18th April 2020. But just the day  before  the launch, the date was [**pushed forward**](https://blog.nem.io/nem-ecosystem-symbol-launch-plan/)   to mid to late November. According to this new schedule, the opt-in   date was late June, which is now going to happen on September 15.\n\nToday\u2019s announcement reveals that the mainnet launch is now scheduled for December 2020.\n\n[Source](https://crypto-economy.com/nem-announces-symbol-opt-in-date-for-xem-holders/)",

Poloniex? Kraken? purchase ETH on coinbase then transfer to poloniex?\n\n-TO participate in an ICO, would i need to have the underlying current they are asking for? and if so, where would they send the tokens from the ICO?\n\n-And lastly about wallets; would i have to hold an alt coin in a separate wallet other than exchange? and if so, does each coin have it's dedicated wallet?\nThanks!",

            "text": " \n\nHi all, I was looking for new coins to invest in and found this gem, [shardcoin.io](https://shardcoin.io/). It has been flying under the radar and the team has been building their product for three years from scratch. Most coins now a days don't have the product at the time of their launch. That is not the case with SHARD. The team has been developing a plethora of projects for their shard ecosystem. Their wallet has been out for some time and is constantly being updated. Even Binance retweeted about their wallet Infinity Wallet (link: tweet ), so you can guess the seriousness of the project!\n\nAbout the team:\n\nThe team consists of very tech savvy developers and you can see their expertise in their products. I am not going to tell you how good their products are, see them for yourselves. Here are a couple of examples.\n\n1. Infinity Wallet More than a simple wallet\n2. Infinity Crypto DEX - the future of DEXs\n\nShard is one of the most innovative coins to come to BSC & ETH it has one of the most innovative and unique ecosystems within the crypto industry and has worked on its technology for over 3 years with a fully self funded team with over 19,500 holders already and over 75,000 community members with potential to easily reach $4,000,000,000 with its leading and most innovative protocols and platforms. This is one of the few projects or the only serious project to be on BSC & ETH, it has 3 large scale unique projects already developed which not only are leading in technological advancements and making adoption of DeFi easier than ever before but are providing 100s of use cases for Shard. Unlike 99% of all projects on BSC these protocols and platforms are not forks or clones unlike projects such as PancakeSwap. This team has worked on their technology and products for over 3 years to bring quality and unique innovation within the space as well as long term growth to crypto and value with its multi-billion dollar platforms that normally are seen from multiple projects and not just one. Shard is currently doing a chain swap from its own chain to BSC & ETH as voted on by us the community this is to bring a wide range of new use cases to Shard and governance of the Infinity Protocols and Shard as well as several new top exchange listings. It is quite simply one of the most innovative projects in DeFi working on its technology for quite some time. This is not a pump and dump coin and is a proper investment in something which is a contender to Binance, PancakeSwap, Uniswap, SushiSwap and etc, with a well known team leading DeFi advancements\n\nWebsite - [https://shardcoin.io/](https://shardcoin.io/)\n\nInfinity Crypto Twitter - [https://twitter.com/InfinityCrypto](https://twitter.com/InfinityCrypto)\n\nShard Twitter - [https://twitter.com/shardcoin](https://twitter.com/shardcoin)\n\nInfinity Wallet Twitter - [https://twitter.com/Infinity\\_Wallet](https://twitter.com/Infinity_Wallet)\n\nThese are just some of the use cases that they have planned they say they have many more to come in the future. This is one of the coins with the most uses cases and largest platforms in DeFi that you would generally expect from 3 projects or more.\n\nDecentralized Governance of the infinity protocols, making holders of Shard decision makers for Shard, the Infinity Protocol and certain aspects of the Platform;\n\nA wide range of deflationary methods, starting with a % of trading fees and whitelisting used to burn Shard, with many more methods in the future from all platforms (Only possibility is for the price to go up )\n\nUsed for liquidity pool staking, providing incentives and benefiting those contributing to liquidity on Infinity Crypto and Protocols.\n\nUsed for staking, allowing Shard holders to stake their Shard and earn rewards without needing to participate in liquidity pool staking.\n\nTo provide a wide range of rewards and incentives such as airdrops, cash-backs, referral rewards, development grants and much more planned for the future, with further community proposals voted on by holders.\n\nVote with Shard or by holding Shard on decisions to be made on Shard, the Infinity Protocol and parts of the Platform;\n\nShard will be usable to contribute to whitelist tokens. Whitelisting will allow tokens to show as default on the Infinity Wallet and Infinity Crypto allowing for increased adoption, awareness, volume, liquidity and community growth. (I also heard that the Shard paid to list will be burned but cant remember where I saw it since they have so much information out its hard to keep up)\n\nAccess to features & discounts by holding or using Shard in the future.\n\nMY OPINION\n\nAs a long term supporter of this project I see it as one of the few crypto gems that has the potential to be as big or even bigger than uniswap with its game changing technology and advancements, with constant hard working team which has self funded the project and never stop working to bring new innovations to blockchain like no other team I have seen. They are the only token I know which is bringing such large advancements and unique technology to crypto that is below $200,000,000 Market Cap and this is mainly because they have not marketed yet and focused on delivering their products before getting the wider crypto attention. They are now getting ready to market and already have a massive community of supporters, this coin is ready to explode and Binance has been retweeting what they do so something big is cooking there and no surprise with their platforms and protocols leading the DeFi space.[https://twitter.com/binance/status/1311361441358843912](https://twitter.com/binance/status/1311361441358843912)",

Portfolio Token is aiming to provide holders with benefits that have never existed in the crypto space. Holding PTF you gain 5% reflections on every transaction, nothing new there. But another 5% of every transaction is deposited into the investment wallet. As the investment wallet grows in value it will be converted to BNB and used to invest in other profitable crypto coins, stocks and real estate holdings. When these investments gain in profit they will be converted back to BNB and injected into the Liquidity Pool. This is revolutionary! This means that PTF value will be stabilized as it grows naturally by other profitable investments. When PTF token liquidity pool has reached a point of sufficient stability, 100% of the investment profits will be converted into PTF to be distributed to all holders as reflections. This is unheard of! UNTILL NOW!\n\nPORTFOLIO TOKEN! The Investing Token!

I want to buy Iota, but with bitfinex pulling out of the US there are not really any exchanges/wallets that offer Iota for the US- is my best bet to use Binance to buy the IOTA with something like ETH? Second question would be how do I get the ETH into my Binance wallet, because it looks like they only do crypto and you cannot buy with US dollars? Is there an easier way to buy IOTA that would offer more liquidity? \n\nEdit: So I think binance might be my best bet for buying iota and possibly for exchanging all coins, but what exchange would you suggest to turn my US dollars into crypto, preferably ethereum?

We also pride ourselves on remaining community focused, and place a strong focus on creating easy to use, user centric solutions that allow anyone to make peer to peer (P2P) transactions that are free from any intermediaries, and also allow users to uphold their own personal privacy if they so wish. With new developments soon to be released, we would like to highlight the past development work that underpins our network and provides the solid foundation that will support all future innovations.\n\n**Privacy Focused Technical Innovations**\n\nFor the greater cryptocurrency community, NavCoin is a \u201cprivacy\u201d project that allows users to make anonymous transactions by obfuscating the key transaction details involving the sender and recipient thus keeping transfers completely private.\n\nWhile this is true, NavCoin has been at the forefront of the \u201ccrypto privacy\u201d movement since 2016 and has also pioneered a number of technological solutions. This began with work to remove the links between coins sent and those being received, and resulted in the launch of our own unique and completely self-developed privacy protocol called Boneh-Lynn-Shacham Confidential Transactions (blsCT). Our blsCT protocol works to maintain users\u2019 privacy by combining two leading technical solutions.\n\n**What is blsCT?**\n\nOur blsCT protocol combines the benefits of Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) Signatures and Confidential Transactions (CT). BLS first emerged in 2001, and enables a group of signatures to be compressed into a compact signature that can be used to authenticate the entire group.\n\nThe BLS Signature scheme is an alternative to other signature schemes like ECDSA (currently used in Bitcoin and NavCoin public transactions) or Schnorr (proposed to be added in an upcoming Bitcoin protocol upgrade). One of the differences between BLS and ECDSA/Schnorr is the elliptic curve which it uses. Both ECDSA/Schnorr use the secp256k1 curve, while BLS instead uses the bls12\u2013381 curve, which is very well suited for pairing operations, a requirement of the BLS signature scheme.\n\nThe bls12\u2013381 elliptic curve has been designed by the Zcash team for use in their zk-SNARK Elliptic Curve Construction, and in addition to Zcash, Ethereum will also use both this curve and the BLS signature scheme in their awaited 2.0 upgrade. However, the most significant difference between ECDSA/Schnorr and BLS, is the way that BLS enables a group of signatures to be compressed into a compact signature that can be used to authenticate the entire group. This enables the signatures of the inputs of a transaction to be aggregated to reduce the required storage, and consequently, multiple transactions and signatures can be aggregated together into a single instance allowing the inputs to be shuffled, hence in practice \u201cmixing\u201d the coins and breaking the link between which inputs pay which outputs.\n\nConfidential Transactions is now known to be a well established cryptographic protocol which encrypts transaction value amounts, while still allowing for the fact that no coins can be created or destroyed within a transaction to be verified. Confidential Transactions is used in well established projects like Monero, Grin, Beam, the Lelantus protocol from Firo, and Liquid from Blockstream.\n\nNavCoin\u2019s blsCT innovates by combining both methods to create a new protocol which allows to mix inputs from different transactions while keeping the amounts hidden in a trustless way, backed by mathematics.\n\nAdditionally, our blsCT protocol prevents an observer from being able to tell if a transaction has been aggregated or not while also providing our network participants and node runners the opportunity to earn by offering their coins for mixing participating in the aggregation market. Here, our community is directly involved in the daily operations of the network and are compensated accordingly for their participation.\n\n**The Comprehensive xNAV Privacy System**\n\nOur commitment to continuous innovation has led to the successful development of xNAV which is both a new privacy enhanced token and mixing protocol created on top of blsCT and Dandelion++.\n\nDandelion++ improves upon current privacy protocols and was originally developed for Bitcoin by a research team at the University of Illinois. It makes changes to how transactions propagate through a blockchain network in order to make it even more difficult for anyone to link a single transaction, or group of transactions, to a specific IP address.\n\nIt is used to broadcast transactions and requests for coins. Here, nodes simply send an encrypted message to other nodes asking for coins to mix in with whenever they want to send a private transaction using xNAV.\n\nAs a result, xNAV can be viewed as a trustless, decentralized version of CoinJoin enhanced with obfuscated amounts while every node holding xNAV participates in the mixing process. CoinJoin is a popular method of making a Bitcoin transaction more private and involves multiple parties contributing to transactions so that addresses can be mixed making the coins more difficult to trace.\n\nWhen using xNAV to transact a node just needs to pick some coins from the list it has already compiled automatically, aggregate them together, and then send them on to be included in a block. Additionally, the inputs and outputs can be further shuffled before submitting the block thus adding an extra layer of obfuscation, and the NavCoin Core wallet picks up to 5 coins from a list by default each time it sends an xNAV transaction.\n\nThis entire process is carried out by the NavCoin wallet in the background, and when completed no one can surmise which wallet holder is asking for coins nor which coins are given to any wallet holder, not even the user offering the coins.\n\nThis allows our users to benefit from using cutting edge privacy protocols in an efficient, and painless manner, and make use of a trustless and decentralized system which is free from any intrusive intermediaries.\n\nRead more [here](https://medium.com/nav-coin/navcoin-an-established-history-of-innovation-8c702178e32c).",

XEM holders should  prepare for a blockchain snapshot to  receive a 1-for-1 allocation of  the new XYM token on Symbol.\n\nThe [NEM Group](https://nem.io/) has begun the opt-in process to[ Symbol](https://symbolplatform.com/),   the next-generation enterprise-grade blockchain solution that replaces   the original NEM blockchain. The first step of the migration from NEM   NIS1, NEM\u2019s original blockchain platform, to the new Symbol public  chain  will be introduced in parallel with NIS1. To ensure existing NIS1  users  can continue to run their applications as usual, the two chains  will  operate side-by-side.\n\nDavid  Shaw, CEO of NEM Group, says the opt-in process is a critical  part of  the migration process and an essential step on the roadmap to  the  launch of Symbol. \u201cOur team has built a robust platform, taking the   learnings from building NEM NIS1 in addition to advancements in the   industry and feature set ideas to develop Symbol.\u201d Shaw says Symbol was   built from the ground up to be secure, scalable, and decentralized,  with  enterprise applications at its core. \u201cNIS1 users who choose to  opt-in  now will be among the first to experience all of Symbol\u2019s  capabilities  following the mainnet launch,\u201d he says.\n\n# The XEM / XYM snapshot\n\nAn important component of the migration to the new Symbol chain is that all holders of [XEM](https://bravenewcoin.com/data-and-charts/assets/XEM/price-summary),   NEM NIS1\u2019s native crypto asset, are eligible to receive XYM tokens on   Symbol when it launches later this year. XEM holders who choose to   opt-in will obtain an XYM balance equal to their XEM balance at the time   of the snapshot, a timestamp when user balances in XEM on the NEM   blockchain will be recorded. This snapshot, a record of all XEM account   balances on the NEM NIS1 blockchain, will be taken in early December   2020.\n\nXYM will be allocated based  on each user\u2019s on-chain XEM balance. The  NEM team recommends that users  move XEM off exchanges and into the  official NEM Wallet. The NEM  Wallet has been updated to include a Symbol  Opt-in module, which will  make it simple to opt-in via your NEM  account. XEM account holders are  able to opt-in to claim their XYM  tokens at Snapshot. NEM has published  a [detailed guide](https://nemplatform.com/symbol-migration/) to using the wallet during the opt-in process to receive the new XYM tokens.\n\nFor  each 1 XEM held by users at the time of Snapshot, they will  receive 1  XYM  (1 XEM = 1 XYM). All XYM allocations will be based on  this  one-time record of XEM balances, so XYM allocations for opt-in will  be  based on the amount of XEM users hold during the Snapshot.\n\n# What is NEM\u2019s Symbol?\n\n[Symbol](https://symbolplatform.com/)  is a  next-generation blockchain solution designed for enterprise use.  Symbol  (codename Catapult) represents a full rewrite of the NEM  protocol and  has been in development since 2018. Symbol is designed to  help  businesses cut costs, reduce complexities, and streamline  innovation.  Symbol is expected to provide significant upgrades in  flexibility,  security, speed, and ease of use over the original NEM  blockchain.\n\nIain Wilson, Chief  Financial Officer of NEM Group, says Symbol  represents the start of  NEM\u2019s next chapter, describing it as a  purpose-built solution to help  companies experience the business  benefits of blockchain. \u201cWe want our  community to be part of this  process, by opting-in, participating in  the snapshot and helping to  continue to tell the NEM story as we  continue to drive innovation, build  the NEM ecosystem and develop  Symbol into the go-to blockchain solution  for enterprise.\u201d\n\nOpt-in is now open via the[ desktop wallet](https://nemplatform.com/symbol-migration), with mobile versions (Google Play and iOS) launching soon.\n\n[Source](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/nem-news)",

            "text": "Nowadays there is a trend of enrolling in Loyalty Program Operators. People enroll in numerous LPO and later it becomes a daunting task for the users to manage the account and passwords. People wish to gain enough points to redeem while shopping, but they rarely get it. These points get expired over time and then the users regret about it. The LPOs also try to make it daunting for the users to transfer their points by setting up conditions such as Blackout dates. The customers find it difficult to use all the points they have gained. The program owners make a huge profit from this which is quite unfair.\n\n\n**The Gabrotech** is a blockchain powered project envisioned to disrupt the way loyalty rewards market operates. It is trying to eliminate the inefficiencies by decentralizing the points control. The public will gain the control of their points back by using Gabrotech\u2019s solution. This blockchain powered platform is capable of tracing the number of tokens used or traded. It will form an ecosystem by bringing different merchants, LPOs, customers, and institutional buyers together with a unique and common digital asset which is Gabro.\n\n\n\n**Gabrotech\u2019s solution:**\n\n> *People are not satisfied with the current LOPs and they want power back in their hands. The Gabrotech is providing what people need by using the cutting-edge solutions offered by the Blockchain technology. This platform will completely eliminate the need of maintaining several different accounts and passwords. This platform will connect numerous merchants and LPOs through the blockchain. The participants on this platform can collect all their reward points from different programs. So, the customers can get enough points to redeem while buying goods and services. Thus, the lower and idle points can be utilized to gain the rewards.*\n\n\n**Key features of Gabrotech program:**\n\nGabrotech will introduce many sources through which the participants can earn the reward points and spend them whenever needed. It is also offering the GBO tokens which will work as a legal cryptocurrency. The key features Gabrotech offering are as follows:\n\n**\u2022\tGabro pro-paid card:**\n*The users will get a physical Gabro card that they can use to redeem their reward points. This card can be used in 200 countries and over 60 million outlets will accept this card.* \n\n\n\n**\u2022\tDigital wallet:**\n*Managing several different loyalty programs may seem like a daunting task if you follow the traditional approach, but not with the Gabro wallet. This digital wallet will help you in managing and using your loyalty reward points with ease. It is a secure program that will protect your rewards and other information.* \n\n\n\n**\u2022\tMulti-currency conversion engine:**\n*The MCCE or multi-currency conversion engine is a new feature that will use the Gabrotech liquidity pool to convert the supported crypto assets into the fiat money any time the user wants.* \n\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n*Gabrotech is addressing a very important issue that has always frustrated millions of people across the globe. This platform is also beneficial for the LPOs, merchants and other people who want to gain profit with the GBO tokens.*",

(I think this is a thing) vs. a Hardware wallet?\n\nHow all cryptocurrencies work is that there is a public part and a private part to \"each\" coin, the public part is the address, and the private part is just some data. Any type of software that manages this is a \"wallet\". So all these things are wallets, as for the differences:\n\n- coinbase & bittrex\n\nThey manage the private part of the coin for you, by logging into their platform you gain (indirect access). The major problems are: if they get hacked you lose your coins and if they (or the law they are required to obey) don't like you they can block  access.\n\n- a wallet that you download and keep on your computer? (I think this is a thing) vs. a Hardware wallet?\n\nThis is software that manages the private part, and the difference here is how good they are at keeping it secret. If you have a wallet on your computer and you get a virus, the private part (=your money) wil be stolen. A hardware wallet is a wallet that cannot easily get a virus, and even if the computer you plug the hardware wallet into has one, the virus can't steal your money.",

From fiat currencies, startup crowdsale tokens, cryptocurrencies, to stocks and other important assets. It\u2019s literally a global marketplace on your smartphone. I was able to download the marketplace on my phone. However, when I tried to add funds to my wallet, I got a message stating, \u201cWe are in the process of obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for our services under the jurisdiction of the USA\u2026 BLAH BLAH BLAH\u201d. So essentially, if you wanted to get some Lykke on the ground floor but you\u2019re living in the US, forget about it. If you\u2019re anywhere else in the world, this project might be something you want to look into.\n \nNext we have,    \nVOISE    \n-Are you in a band and can\u2019t seem to find the funding you need to get your music into people\u2019s ears around the globe? Are you a music lover that seeks out indie music just to show your friends that there\u2019s more to life than the top 40? If you answered yes to at least one of those questions, Voise might be the greatest thing since sliced bread, for you. Voise allows anyone to upload their music and allow others around the world to listen to it, on the blockchain. It also allows listeners to go in and setup profiles, playlists, radio stations, and more. You can discover music that others are listening to by viewing the top downloaded songs of the month. Not sure about you but this project sounds really awesome to me. If you would like to invest in this project, the ICO (also known as initial coin offering or initial crowd offering) is going on right now, until June 6th, 2017. For 1 Ether, you can pick up 160 Voise coins. These coins will help pay for the website, smart phone apps, and all other development projects moving forward. Good luck Voise devs and keep up the great work!\n \nLast but not least,    \nCURRENT CRYPTO MARKET    \n-Today the value of Bitcoin and Ethereum have dropped 8% and 9%, respectively. The market cap has gone from close to $90 Billion to $76 Billion US dollars. These sell offs are causing many of the other altcoins to bleed as well. Is it a good time to sell? Hell no. It\u2019s a great time to buy. Get in while the market is cheap. Hold for the next week and then sell some of your profits! The market will bounce back. Don\u2019t let the panic sellers get in your head. Be stronger than they are and hold on to your assets. You won\u2019t regret it.\n     \nQUESTIONS FROM YESTERDAY    \n-Scott Sliter asked, \u201cIs it too late to buy bitcoin? I see people making a mad rush for it.\ufeff\u201d    \nWell Scott, personally I think it\u2019s still a great time to buy in to Bitcoin. With more people adopting this technology it will only grow in value. Once people start using blockchain technology for their everyday life, that\u2019s when it will be too late to buy in. Right now, we\u2019ve barely even scratched the surface.    \n-PoppONaya Shelly commented, \u201cAWESOME!! we dont hear nearly enough cryptoadvocates speak about Golem. Needless to say\u2026 we subscribed!! Please take a look at our tiny channel\u2026.\"    \nEric and Alison, thanks for the awesome compliment! I checked out your channel and really liked what I saw. It\u2019s always great to see new faces in the community. Welcome and I wish you both the best of luck. \n",

How can you use crypto to buy milk and bread if your coins are locked up in an illiquid, hard-to-access exchange? \n\nToday, cryptocurrencies are stores of value, rather than a currency. But that\u2019s not what the vision was. That\u2019s not what cryptocurrencies were meant to do. If we are to experience the true benefits of cryptocurrencies, then we need to use them for what they were intended: a currency.\n\nIt\u2019s a chicken and egg situation: crypto is still seen as the Wild West due to the lack of regulation and price volatility, which means most people don\u2019t want to use cryptocurrencies to buy everyday items. But in order to achieve more stable prices and regulatory approval, people need to start using it as a currency. So where do we start?\n\nThere\u2019s one place to start: by bypassing crypto exchanges altogether. Let\u2019s dive into the main issues with crypto exchanges and what the best alternatives are. \n\n**The problems with crypto exchanges**\n\n**Lack of accessibility**\n\nThe barrier to entry for the layman to start buying crypto is still high. The first place a \u201ccrypto-curious\u201d person usually goes is a crypto exchange, but these are often confusing and don\u2019t educate the user on the benefits of cryptocurrencies. Instead, exchanges focus on getting users to join in on the hype and start speculating, trading, and being part of a gambling game. \n\nWhen a user successfully signs up to hold crypto on an exchange, it\u2019s still practically impossible to use cryptocurrencies for everyday needs because everything first needs to be converted to fiat (nerd talk for US Dollar). Modern-day crypto holders find themselves holding multiple online and offline wallets, memorizing several keys and passwords, and having to complete two-factor authentication over and over again. Combine this with a lack of transparency, poor customer service, and lack of regulation, and we find ourselves with the furthest thing from a user experience that would encourage mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. . The result: today, most cryptocurrencies are locked up in cold wallets, keeping prices volatile and cryptocurrencies as an asset, rather than a currency. \n\n**Inefficient**\n\nThe modern-day crypto enthusiast holds multiple hot wallets, a cold wallet, several bank accounts, brokerage accounts, and savings accounts. It\u2019s still a headache to manage money, especially when crypto is involved. Having to juggle ten different financial apps and constantly transferring cryptocurrencies from one to another is not the most user-friendly way to use crypto. Every time a user decides to open an account with a new crypto exchange, the situation gets even more complicated, not to mention, expensive. \n\n**Prone to security issues** \n\nOne of the biggest problems facing exchanges is the lack of security. Crypto exchanges have suffered hack after hack, with the latest one being a[ $150 million loss from the exchange KuCoin](https://www.zdnet.com/article/kucoin-cryptocurrency-exchange-hacked-for-150-million/#:~:text=KuCoin%20said%20the%20hacker%20managed,some%20of%20the%20stolen%20funds.).\n\nAfter the hack happened, Kucoin blocked all deposits and withdrawals and chose to ignore customers\u2019 questions. The average person won\u2019t put their money into an account that is deemed risky, prone to security breaches, and is handled by an unresponsive team. \n\nFor real mass adoption, we need crypto accounts to be treated like regular bank accounts which can only happen once crypto accounts are backed by governments and regulations. The good news is that this is already starting to happen\u2026\n\n**The solution**\n\nHow do we help cryptocurrencies go mainstream with these inefficiencies of crypto exchanges? \n\nBelow are some of the things that could help salvage the situation:\n\n**Crypto debit cards**\n\nCredit and debit cards are still the most convenient and easiest way to purchase everyday items.As more crypto cards are becoming available, there is interest from users to earn rewards while using their cards. The crypto card functions like a traditional credit card but they pay rewards in digital currencies like BTC and the rest.\n\nCrypto cards are also always backed by card issuers like Visa and MasterCard. It's a new way of spending that every crypto enthusiast should be exploring. Some of the Crypto cards I have found really interesting are;\n\nCrypto.com card which gives its returns in CRO( it's token). There are a lot of incentives while using this card which includes 10% back on Airbnb and Expedia purchases, 100% back on your Amazon prime, Netflix and Spotify purchases. Crypto.com is compatible with more than 90 different cryptocurrencies so it's widely used.\n\nAnother option which I have personally explored and is suitable for me is the[ 6banc.com](https://www.6banc.com/) card which has no ATM fees, Overdraft, minimum balance. Moreover, one can use Six to withdraw cash from 60,000 ATMs at places like Walgreens, CVS, and 7-Eleven. For me personally I find this to be cost friendly. They have a couple of options with their card from, for personal, business and Crypto payment options.\n\n**Open exchange** \n\nThe US Government[ issued a letter last year](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/occ-allows-banks-to-hold-cryptocurrency-assets-for-safekeeping) that made waves in the crypto industry. The US regulator of national banks officially stated that American banks can now provide cryptocurrency custody services on behalf of customers.\n\nThat means that your bank account can now hold your cryptocurrency along with your fiat currency (aka your US dollar), and you can start using cryptocurrencies for everyday purposes straight from your bank account.\n\nBanks can therefore enable an open exchange: the average person will be able to transfer crypto directly into their bank account, send it to other people, and use it to purchase items. As you can see, this effectively bypasses crypto exchanges: who needs a third-party crypto exchange when you can buy, sell, hold and use crypto directly and securely from your bank account?\n\nThis is key to making crypto mainstream and is the first sign that crypto exchanges will quickly fall by the wayside.\n\n**Crypto to build credit**\n\nWhat if you could use crypto to build your credit score and secure loans? People use credit cards to help build credit, receive credit rewards, and secure loans. With over[ 200 million Americans](https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/ownership-statistics/) currently using credit cards, there are a lot of opportunities to meet the demand for credit cards through cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor demographics with bad credit, this opens up a lot of doors to better financial products. With crypto bank accounts, financial institutions could use cryptocurrencies as a reserve to offer credit cards. Users could then build credit based on the strength of their cryptocurrency wallet, opening up accessibility to mortgages, auto loans, etc. \n\n**Invest & borrow using crypto currency** \n\nCurrently, your checking account balance sits in a bank\u2019s money market account where it gains a small amount of interest over time. With crypto, banks will do the same: your crypto will be generating returns even when it\u2019s sitting quietly in your bank account. In an ideal world, your crypto earns a return that helps you beat inflation, save for retirement, and enjoy the benefits of compound interest. On the \u201cborrow\u201d side, banks will enable fiat loans based on your crypto balances, very much like a secured loan. Crypto exchanges will be a thing of the past as banks catch up. Now with government support, they are.\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nWe don\u2019t believe crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance will die. However, over time it\u2019s likely that they will turn into exchanges similar to OTC markets where penny stocks live. These exchanges will be used by traders who want to have fun, create pump and dump schemes, and trade altcoins..",

            "text": "The use of NFT as a social media profile picture addresses a new design trend. Since Twitter announced the integration of NFT as a profile picture, people who are really into crypto have started adopting and extensively using it, and if reports are true, reddit and discord are also jumping into this scene and integrating NFT on their platforms. When combined with the metaverse, avatars have enormous potential. Metaverse Avater Nft is a very unique type of Nft, despite the fact that it is still in development.\n\nIt necessitates a significant amount of effort due to its one-of-a-kind nature and metaverse-based nature. The possibilities, I tell you, are endless. Despite the bear market, the craze for Bayc and cryptopunks is real and still going strong as social media integrations with the profile pic thing. I believe avatars will play a significant role in the next trend cycle in the NFT sector, but the real question is whether or not everyone can afford these expensive avatars.\n\nIf you're looking at it from the standpoint of adoption, yes. As more people become aware of blockchain technology, it will gain popularity, and NFt avatars will become commonplace and used in our daily lives without our knowledge in 2-3 years.\n\nPeople have recently started to use non-traditional profile pictures on social media accounts. Non-fiction Tweets, which are a single sentence with a photo that combine the best of both worlds, are the most popular. You can create your own NFT or use one from a favourite author to express your personality and interests while maintaining the benefits of a traditional profile picture. If you don't already have one, you can create one with the help of a tool called nft avatar maker, which offers a variety of customization options.\n\nI know I can't compare Bayc and CP to anything else because they're so popular and have so much celebrity support. However, I'm referring to the potential future of current NFT avatar projects.\n\nWhy would someone pay for your NFT avatar when they can make their own for a fraction of the price? Certainly, utility is a factor to consider, but projects that lack utility will struggle in the future, especially as tools such as the NFT avatar maker enter the market at the same time that social media platforms begin to integrate NFTs.\n\nThis was just a guess; we'll have to wait and see what the future holds for these NFT avatars with limited utility.",

Axie made so many people so much money, more importantly, the way it was built allowed people with small funds to work as \u2018scholars\u2019 for large funders, really interesting strategy. Another game sweeping the markets right now is kitty kart and it\u2019s showing no signs of stopping, growing slowly but consistently. \n\nUse cases for NFTs are still growing so beyond this, as is this the case of audio NFTs, Despite being still under heavy study, they are forecasted to be really successful and triple the success that JPEG NFTs have made, now since the foundation has been already laid; the die has been cast. \n\nMore so are NFTs being studied to be made more practical, such as to be used as a sort-of patent of authenticity or uniqueness certification. This could prove elemental in the case of patent engineering or medical fields.",

It should be abstract enough to represent the user's identity.\n\nAs the market for AI-generated NFTs matures, new projects have emerged that allow you to create your own NFt avatar rather than relying on a pre-made image. You may occasionally be unable to customise your avatar after purchasing a nft. You must keep track of your purchases.\n\n The Nft avatar generator, for example, is now available. Customizable NFTs, similar to avatars, will become a reality as a result of this adoption. My attention was drawn to the NFT avatar maker project, which is a \"\"all-in-one\"\" avatar tool. Users will be able to customise their Avatars with assets from a growing library that will include billions of possible combinations and over 1200 assets at launch.\u2013",

We've seen this with pay to play, and people are very sensitive to this and will hate it. When Ubisoft released a video telling everyone that owning their expensive NFT makes you special - it was hated.\n\n2) Add value using NFTs. You could create NFTs that are not only used in your game but that you are able to use in other games (even other developer's platforms or decentralized games). You could also build a community around an NFT and give owners various benefits. Or, give a free random NFT when someone buys your game.\n\nCompanies that do #2 will succeed while companies that do #1 will make us cringe.\n\nThere is one other thing: games can be entirely built around blockchain. There are already several strategy-like games that combine NFTs/FTs with a website UI (and even traditional markets like sushi swap) that are actually a ton of fun. Think of them being more like poker with real money at stake. I personally think people are underestimating these. Starting with NFT as the base for a game might be more successful than games that try to transition into NFT compatibilities.",

Therefore, it is interesting on the marketplaces of which blockchains there is a prospect of hype and the development of the NFT market? At the moment, I know that there is a fairly promising NFT market on FLOW, where you can look for cool NFT projects, and also a fairly promising one on NEAR, where it is quite easy and cheap to create NFTs as well as good funding.",

(I hardly see anyone calling them Jpegs now). In my opinion, they will be the best performers this year.\n\nThe gaming sector will bring a lot of adoption for crypto and we can see gaming companies, gamers, investors, developers are all tapping into the blockchain gaming scene. That is just the beginning, as NFTs are incorporated into the games. The Microsoft CEO did say gaming will play a key tole in the development of the metaverse......\n\nTop projects like AXS, MANA, GALA, SAND started the GameFi and Play-To-Earn hype, Upcoming projects like Monster Galaxy, Mecha Morphing and Legends of Elumia will carry it on.\n\nMonster Galaxy is my personal favorite. Developed by Gaia Online; a popular mobile gaming company, Monster Galaxy is a hit game series that was first released in 2011 and they are now coming into the blockchain gaming and Play to Earn scene via tokenization and NFTs.\n\nWorking with Animoca Brands; a venture capital firm with a growing portfolio of top-notch NFT projects such as Axie Infinity, OpenSea and Dapper Labs, Monster Galaxy will launch their Free to Play mobile P2E game in March, this partnership tells me it will be AAA quality.\n\nOkay, so it's a creature taming and battling game where at the start of the game, players get free MOGAs and equipments. The game model incorporates the concept of an open economy where players are incentivized to participate in various activities to earn Galaxy Gems or GGM.\n\nGGM has robust token utility within the game as it will be used to purchase equipments and weapons and special powers for their Moga monsters.\n\nIn the very near future, I expect GGM to compete as a top contender in the gaming scene. Massive adoption is imminent here.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on what the future of the metaverse/NFT/GameFi/PlayToEarn sector(s)?",

And because not all platforms have insurance backing like Solanaprime and other similar ones, by the time you discover that your NFT project is a scam, it would be already too late.\n\nNFTs are a volatile part of the already volatile cryptocurrency market.  So its a bit hard to manage finding some legit ones that can actually make you some decent profit.\n\nKinda sad how NFTs have taken a bad rep over the years",

Imagine you have ownership over your dog, then another person comes in and tries to steal your dog. The conflict begins and now the both of you need to prove whose dog is it. The other person has nothing, but you have a collar, a bowl and a doggy house with its name. Those items would be NFT. Their data are a representation of your money that verifies your ownership of the token you have.\n\nLet\u2019s apply this logic. I buy CELA at pre-sale, but I get hacked and my CELAs are transferred to another account. The blockchain will by default categorize this transaction as a legitimate movement within its network. I can\u2019t do anything with it if it gets stolen. However, since the token will be released as an NFT too, then I can guarantee that my data won\u2019t get stolen if I use it as such, and, thus, my money.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re unhackable. It\u2019s the same as the dog\u2019s case: if a van comes in, takes your dog, leaves no traces and sells it after that, then it\u2019s impossible to track it down: the same happens with NFTs.\n\nAlso, these representations make the crypto market much more understandable. You\u2019ll be able to sell and buy these NFTs instantly. You can evaluate how much you can gain with a certain NFT taking into consideration what other NFTs you\u2019ll be gaining with it. This is why it\u2019s so appealing for newcomers: you don\u2019t actually have to know a lot about crypto, you have to know about the NFTs\u2019 fields in order to make good decisions. Unfortunately, most people don\u2019t even know what the NFT is about and hence lose a lot of money.\n\nA recent example is Axie Infinity: although promising, if you don\u2019t know how to play a turn-based RPG and how to evaluate the meta, then you won\u2019t win, thus, you won\u2019t get hold of better NFTs.\n\nThis is the way I understand it, not much of an NFT enjoyer myself.",

You see serious brands and companies jumping on NFTs and leveraging its potential. \n\nI have been a big fan of NFT Ticketing, which seem to be in vogue given the attention it received from the likes of Vitalik, Snoop, Cuban - just to name a few. Many projects are trying to kick off a NFT Ticketing project and are in different stages of maturity. So far I think **GET Protocol** (token: GET) is the clear leader of the pack and next two years could be huge for them. \n\nGET Protocol is being used by different integrators across the globe. Each ticket they sell will require a certain amount of GET, which is taken out of the circulation. The amount of GET is fixed, so we are looking at deflationary powers and a natural demand for the coin. The numbers are looking **VERY** impressive and with COVID finally behind us this could be a hidden gem with a market cap under 50m!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Founded in 2016\n* In October 2021 GET sold their 1M tickets\n* Total tickets sales in 2021: 560K\n* Tickets sales this quarter 253K\n* Ticket sales in the last 7 days: 37.7K\n\nAll is visisble onchain and it is one of the rare crypto projects with a real life usecase AND economics that make sense. If you do the math and extrapolate the growth it is hard not to get very bullish on this project.",

They can range from $20 \u2013 $1000 and have extremely affordable interest rates (or in some cases no interest rate) and terms. The main goal of microlending is to help entrepreneurs who would otherwise be unable to borrow money to launch or expand their businesses, thereby reducing poverty in impoverished areas. \n\nToday\u2019s microlending system involves a website like suku.world, investors, (a microlender that lends to borrowers in a particular location like a financial institution such as a small NGO or large commercial bank), and a borrower. Investors browse the microlending website for one or more people or ideas in which they may want to invest. The microlending website collects the funds and channels them to the borrower through a microlender accessible in the borrower's location. The borrower then invariably pays back the microloan with interest.\n\"",

In so many of these NFT projects, a group of friends will buy and resell the same JPEG to each other to get some decent hype on it, then when it takes off, they pass it on to the next oblivious fool and let them carry the bags. If you haven\u2019t seen this yet, you really should be careful about what you buy especially in the NFT market. \n\nIt\u2019s not easy reading which NFTs are trustable and which aren\u2019t, in my experience I have found it best to inspect the exchange that is promoting said NFT and vet the platform itself. It\u2019s like buying a used car, the car is only in as good a shape as its owner. \n\nI find that exchanges the will let absolutely anyone mint anything, ehem OpenSea, are usually on the sh*te side. Nothing wrong with the exchange itself, just that it\u2019s really rather tough finding something of value in a literal sea of filth. Or even worse, something that\u2019s not a scam, scheme or pull in the making. \n\nI find other exchanges that are way too strict to be too expensive lmao. I\u2019m talking super ones like Rarible and its sort who will only allow in major rockstars of the NFT industry. Both are way too extreme. I rather go for an NFT platform that will only allow verified artists and will double check every NFT minted. Some platforms like Yunometa for example, will focus on verifying their creator first, which inevitably leads to some good art. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be a bag holder again, it felt like dog poop when this happened to me in the DOGE days (pun intended) and I don\u2019t want to be there again.",

As part of the evolving NFT phenomenon, users of other NFT avatars also reflect a sense of digital identity.\n\nThis will no longer be limited, as social media behemoths have jumped in, and an increasing number of people will use the NFt as an avatar.

            "text": "Since at least 2019, Web3 projects have been incentivizing their communities to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges. Liquidity is the lifeblood of any protocol and facilitating that liquidity in one way or another is a basic prerequisite for a successful project.\n\nWhen Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap were the dominant DEXes, liquidity mining was relatively straightforward. All liquidity deposits on those exchanges are natively fungible, meaning that any deposit is directly comparable to any other one. Additionally, all liquidity deposits on those exchanges \u201ccover\u201d the full price range of the two assets in the pool, meaning that the AMM formula would serve up a price if token0 approached  an infinite value relative to token1 and, similarly, if token1  approached an infinite value relative to token0.\n\nUniswap V3 is now the dominant DEX, owing largely to its more expressive functionality. But with a richer feature-set comes greater complexity. One major casualty of Uniswap V3 is that liquidity mining now requires a profound technical expertise. Even launching an incentive on the full  price range \u2014 the most common approach to Uni V3 LM to date \u2014 still necessitates a degree of complexity.\n\nFear not, Web3-projects-looking-to-incentivize-Uniswap-V3-liquidity. A variety of teams are hard at work building solutions to simplify this process. Naturally, the team building xToken Terminal believes we\u2019ve built the most secure, complete and powerful solution. However, we\u2019ll still run through all the options that are out there in order to provide  you with the most complete set of information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A basic summary of the feature sets for different Uniswap V3 liquidity mining options](https://preview.redd.it/0mw54gluozr81.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=561c420be41794134ec9c66cff2bb01c49ba4ba9)\n\n## xToken Terminal\n\nTerminal is our new capital markets platform, designed to provide DeFi/NFT projects \u2014 and whoever else! \u2014 seamless and permissionless access to fundamental on-chain primitives. The first of these primitives is Uniswap V3 liquidity mining. Via Terminal, a Web3 project can have a [Uni V3 LM program up and running in a few minutes](https://docs.xtokenterminal.io/terminal/mining/create-pool). No dev work or Uniswap expertise required.\n\nPool sponsors select a liquidity pool and price range to incentivize, one or more rewards token(s) to pay out to LPs and an optional vesting period on rewards. Once the liquidity/rewards pool is deployed, sponsors can initiate a rewards program for any amount over any period. Once a rewards program ends, sponsors can initialize a new one. Sponsors never need to leave the Terminal UI.\n\nSimilarly, LPs never need to leave the Terminal UI. LPs do not need to mint an NFT position (the sponsor mints a communal NFT on pool deployment) or navigate to alternative UIs to deposit liquidity pool tokens. Data on staked balances, APR, pool history, etc are all generated permissionlessly and viewable on the Terminal interface.\n\nTerminal is available on L1, Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9gmsdnv0pzr81.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa4e4800406176f0faf5ee8ecf1a4189daab0586\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Gelato (G-Uni)\n\nSimilarly to Terminal, Gelato also provides a fungible interface for a non-fungible Uniswap V3 liquidity position. While Gelato does not actively rebalance liquidity positioning, the protocol provides a  manager role on their contracts that allows a representative of a project to actively re-position if desired.\n\nGelato/G-Uni does not provide any infrastructure for staking rewards, rewards  vesting or rewards data. Projects using G-Uni tokens for liquidity  mining will need to deploy/configure smart contracts and build a custom frontend.\n\n## UniswapV3Staker\n\nThe UniswapV3Staker contract is the most \u201cnative\u201d option available to projects looking to sponsor a liquidity mining program. The contract requires LPs to mint a Uni V3 NFT position and then deposit it. Rewards are paid out as a function of in-range liquidity, i.e. the more trading volume your position helps generate, the more rewards you will earn. This approach may be the most rooted in precision, but in practice it has been [marred by manipulation](https://medium.com/@revert_finance/onetickdao-eth-and-the-narrow-rangers-f9a376f7f0c9) as well as a bevy of UX challenges. It also requires deep Uniswap V3 knowledge to fully understand. Lastly, we\u2019re not aware of a full-feature UI for projects that wish to use the UniswapV3Staker contract.\n\nSome community members have proposed a few modifications to the contract \u2014 notably a change that requires LPs to cover a minimum price tick range. This change is likely to mitigate some or all of the issues related to manipulation of rewards, however, it is unlikely to allay any UX challenges.\n\n## Charm\n\nCharm\u2019s Alpha vaults rely on some of the most clever Uniswap V3 liquidity management logic that can be found in the space. Charm\u2019s vaults rebalance in a way that avoids a direct swapping of assets, instead relying on single-sided pseudo-limit orders \u2014 a Uniswap V3 hallmark.\n\n>Sidenote: many Uni V3 liquidity managers underestimate the slippage costs and gas costs of active rebalancing strategies, thus overestimating the expected value of a rebalance. Maximizing capital efficiency at a given moment does not necessarily lead to maximization of value.\n\nCharm is soon to release a permissionless version of their vaults (Alpha  Pro). It remains to be seen whether their approach, which is well-tested and successful on high liquidity pairs like ETH<>USDC, will be performant \u2014 programmatically or otherwise \u2014 on long tail pools.\n\nAt launch, Alpha Pro will not offer the smart contract or user interface architecture for native liquidity mining.\n\n## Gamma\n\nGamma pursues a more active rebalancing strategy, relying at least partially on off-chain logic that is not transparent to LPs. Though decentralization advocates may protest, there may be something to be  said for this more obscured approach, as purely on-chain rebalance strategies may be vulnerable to front-running or other forms of value extraction. Gamma is in the midst of remodeling their approach to liquidity management, so some elements of this description may no longer be accurate.\n\nGamma pools are not permissionless and there is no native liquidity mining architecture.\n\n# A Note on Rebalancing\n\nWe at xToken have been demo-ing our new platform for a variety of projects in the space. We\u2019ve been excited by the positive feedback we\u2019ve received on the platform\u2019s ease-of-use, configurability and  extensibility.\n\nSeveral projects have asked us why we don\u2019t offer the ability to rebalance  positioning in a pool. As the product currently operates, pool sponsors must set a price range at deployment and are unable to modify that price range (although deploying a new pool with new price range takes only a few minutes). While we are exploring methods of introducing this functionality, we believe that offering a rebalance feature on a permissionless platform like ours could expose our users to frontrunning and other forms of value extraction.\n\nWhy is that? We have experience with Uni V3 repositioning from our time managing [xU3LP](https://medium.com/xtoken/introducing-xu3lp-fungible-yield-f151c747131b), which for several months, was the largest provider of managed Uniswap V3 liquidity. It turns out that rebalancing must be executed very carefully, especially when the position in question is responsible for the lion\u2019s share of liquidity on the Uniswap pair (this concentration of pool ownership is likely the case for many LM programs). In carefully researching management strategies for xU3LP, we witnessed many instances of LP rebalances being front-run by bots on-chain. In short, rebalancing large Uniswap V3 positions requires a level of expertise and sophistication uncommon in the space.\n\n# Get in Touch\n\nInterested in learning more about xToken Terminal?

I figured it was only non-techies who were interested in the new CryptoKitties. Recently, however, even my pals have been discussing NFTs and the recent metaverse projects. At that time, I was curious if I'm misinterpreting NFTs or if NFT holders are misinterpreting them.\n\nThat was back then but today I am bullish on investing in virtual lands and am actually looking for a prospective project where I can buy land. My main bets have always been either Sandbox or Decentraland but both of them are kind of expensive so I had to find some alternatives and today, I came across Bit.country and DEA which houses blockchain games which could potentially be good alternatives.  \n\nWhile people do say negative stuff about NFTs and/or Metaverse projects, In my opinion, other applications of NFTs are still beneficial. Permanent ownership of video game content is one use-case that I'm particularly thrilled about. People frequently invest a significant amount of time or money in a video game before moving on to another. My in-game currency, characters, and things might be moved to another game or sold to other players if they were on the blockchain.\n\nWell what are your thoughts?",

Guilds like TEAM and BlockchainSpace are decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that collaborate to acquire, manage, use, and monetize assets from popular blockchain games like Axie Infinity, The Sandbox, Decentraland,\u00a0Wilder Worlds etc.\n\nThese blockchain gaming guilds make the process of acquiring, sharing, and lending blockchain game assets much safer, allowing new players to get to grips with a variety of play-to-earn game titles with no upfront costs while ensuring that NFTs are kept safe and used at all times.\n\nThey solve this problem by democratizing access to the most popular blockchain games, allowing even those with limited starting capital to trade their time for money in the same way that they would in a typical job. As a result, play-to-earn games have become the primary source of income for thousands of users, many of whom are from developing countries and play through one or more guilds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre they, however, here to stay?",

They describe themselves as a bridge between traditional industries and the opportunity of decentralised finance, which is of itself pretty huge. You can read more about it in this announcement on Yahoo News [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/defactor-awarded-algorand-foundation-grant-145500047.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/defactor-awarded-algorand-foundation-grant-145500047.html) \n\n\u201cDefactor has been awarded a grant to develop a suite of decentralized finance (Defi) products on Algorand including a Defactor Algorand NFT Collateral Engine, Liquidity, and Staking pools.\u201d What do you think??? Could be an absolute game-changer right? \n\nSounds like they\u2019ve had some decent success already around running hackathons and creating a way for an Irish Whiskey Distillery (Gortinore Distillery & Co - there\u2019s a case study you can read) to access the liquidity of their inaccessible asset by tokenising the barrels. Awesome stuff, just think about the opportunities. \n\nCheck out their website for more info [https://defactor.com/](https://defactor.com/)",

Now Mark Zuckerberg has made the decision to go all-in!\n\nFacebook is still on the lookout for its own device category. All of Facebook's products are compatible with competitors' devices. Everyone at Facebook would be forced to pack their belongings and leave if Apple, Google, and Microsoft met tomorrow and decided to remove all Facebook products from their devices. As a result, Mark Zuckerberg is committed to making Google work.\nWhat can we conjure up?\nWell, until you don't need a physical model anymore because you spend so much time in the metaverse. Soon after, you won't need physical devices (like a PC or a game console) because they'll all be sold as services for a fraction of the price they'd cost in the real world. All you'll need is a virtual reality headset and extremely fast (and dependable!) Internet access.\n\nAs a result, different metaverses may exist for various purposes in our daily lives, ranging from gaming to community, according to my conclusion. Many technology companies are claiming to be Metaverse companies or developing Metaverses to augment or enhance people's digital and physical realities, indicating that the Metaverse is gaining traction. Furthermore, activities that are currently carried out in separate environments, such as buying online avatar outfits and accessories, purchasing digital land and building virtual homes, and many others, will be consolidated into a single Metaverse.\n\nSome metaverses, like alienworlds, may simply be places where people go to get their fix and have a good time. Some people may prefer a peaceful metaverse second life to being a part of this craziness. The communities of Metakawn, a Modern Muslim generation-focused initiative, and nfts are very similar. This is the first Halal EcoSystem Metaverse for Modern Muslims with similar values.\n\nIn reality, there can be multiple \"metaverses,\" and the titles of different metaverses, such as internet environments, are meaningless.",

True visionaries where behind projects and they are changing the world one step a time. \n\nI\u2019m online trying my hand at actual jobs which I have studied, such as programming and coding, working online and getting paid in crypto.

            "text": " \n\nFor years, we have witnessed great advancement and growth in the space, despite the January turn down in price. That doesn't stop the projection of new DeFi concepts and innovation, which I believe will keep ascending.\n\nOne of the DeFi concepts and innovations that actually caught my attention the most is the idea of synthetic assets network. It is quite difficult at first to wrap my head around this undervalued concept of DeFi, but its role in DeFi is quite unique.\n\nThis aspect of DeFi will enable users to mint and burn synthetic assets instead of using contracts to create the chain between the underlying asset and the derivative product. Synthetic assets will tokenize this relationship. This means it can impact exposure to any asset in the world-all are from within the crypto ecosystem.\n\nThere are few DeFi with this concept. The one that I think has a futuristic perception of this aspect is PLUG and its blockchain, called the Otto Blockchain, yet to launch. This prompted me to take a deep dive into the blockchain and what seems to be the unique and insightful perspective on the blockchain for synthetic assets, which is what differentiates it from other major crypto blockchains. \n\nThe Otto blockchain will use NFT attestation and identity management solutions, which help to keep track of every transaction that enters and leaves. It is a POS base blockchain with high TPS and serves as a support and haven for potential web3 projects and technology.\n\nPLUG and OTTO work in synergy. They allow users to mint synthetic assets and DeFi with them in a safe environment without moving the underlying asset from their existing provider or exchange. It is interoperable, scalable, and supports cross-chain interaction.\n\nI  think this aspect of DeFi has good potential to scale in the long run.  Mind you, SNX is also a DeFi project that has such an approach in this  regard.",

The biggest risk in this type of trading is to beware scams and rug pulls. As was the case with the SQUID token after the squid game series release on Netflix. They used the hype to roll some profits and rug pulled the people at the top. \n\nIf you have been trading long enough, this should be an easy read for you. First step is you study the team, and make sure they are well equipped and well experienced. You should also look at the investors and funders in charge of providing liquid to the project. \n\nOne good note is to look at their marketing performance, good new projects will often understand the power of marketing and spill good money into their marketing programs. Bad projects will often go over the top in their marketing, and rug pull as soon as they hit massive peak and start to dip. \n\nRead their roadmap, and study their philosophy and final goals, this is what will show whether a coin is a good coin or a shitcoin. This is the format I try to follow when finding new prospects and tokens in the market, such as was the case when I first found FET or now as I am looking into Kitty Inu. The latter seems profitable since it\u2019s entering into the valuable market of NFT gaming and gaming tokens. Really powerful stuff. \n\nTLDR; find gems, make sure they are legit, and do your best to follow through.",

She literally started a fund to get her NFTs started and suddenly rug pulled and stopped the project, taking everyone\u2019s money in the process. After which she got defensive and tried to blame the situation on her misinformed followers and her brain-washed fans. \n\nShe went on a crazy rant on Twitter saying she\u2019s being attacked and her mental health is in jeopardy (?) and that we should be looking at what\u2019s happening in Ukraine rather than punish her for what she did. \n\nI can\u2019t believe celebrities keep getting away with this, they are literally stealing people\u2019s money and these idiot fans won\u2019t learn from their mistakes. \n\nThis is almost always present in the NFT market because it\u2019s the easiest way to go about it and most users there are misinformed and would rush into the first hyped up project they would find. So many celebrities have since replicated this scheme and no one is learning from this lmao. \n\nThis is why it is necessary to implement a separate platform for celebrities within the NFT market and not just let them promote and push their NFTs everywhere. They present the higher risk to the market and their work should be audited up close and monitored throughout.\n\n This is unfair to NFT users and enthusiasts and we should not be allowing this to happen. There exists alternatives such as Yunometa, which has a separate built-in platforms for celebrity shilling and NFTs where they are monitored securely. Please play your part in educating your peers and avoiding falling for this. \n\nDo not support celebrities, support small creators.",

A friend told me that they are developing an Acardex protocol which is an innovative platform on Cardano Blockchain that provides users with advanced Decentralized Exchange and NFT Marketplace functionalities.   \nIt seems that Acardex stands to be the first Defi Platform to offer both Advanced Functionalities of DEX and NFT trading, sounds interesting.  \n\n\nI must admit that I spent a lot of time finding the perfect DeFi solution that will suit me, I heard a lot of recommendations, try this or try that and so on. I've got a little bit tired of all this, so I start looking for my own, I tried a couple of platforms and possibilities but none of them worked for me as 4DOT did and that's how I finally found the perfect one.   \n\n\nMaybe it is hard for someone who didn't have any previous experience with it, I remember at first, I wasn't even familiar with DeFi and how that works but I assure you that 4DOT is so easy to use, you don't have to have any experience with it, everyone can participate in DeFi. I love their D3 Protocol, it's a \"Stake and Earn\" system where users can earn from auto-investing, auto-compounding treasury in yield-bearing of the DeFi assets within the project.   \n\n\nI had to share all this excitement with you because I know how hard is sometimes to follow all these things especially if you are new to all of this, sometimes it's really hard to get it and understand how all this work and why do we need these kinds of tools and solutions. I would be happy what financial instruments do you use?",

Here's everything you need to know.  \n\n\nAccording to some projections, the worldwide gaming industry would be valued $268 billion by 2025. In many nations, pursuing a profession in gaming is no longer frowned upon, but rather encouraged.  \n\n\nOnline gaming, like any other sector, has seen a number of trends and patterns emerge throughout time. The games range from first-person shooters (FPS) to multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games.  \n\n\nThe cryptocurrency sector, in my opinion, has recognized the new market's potential, as well as the impact that blockchain-based innovations such as the Atpay project may have on it. Atpay provides a lot of benefits and can be very useful in the crypto gaming world. The team's blockchain BNPL can be used to purchase NFTs, which are required in order to contribute and earn on P2E platforms. This, I believe, was aided in part by the introduction of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which allowed developers to build and transfer physical value in gaming ecosystems, thereby providing players with additional incentives.  \n\n\nPlay-to-earn (especially in the context of cryptocurrencies) was born in this way, and it's gaining steam. I hope this industry develops as it should, since I think the potential is huge.",

This week Miami Heat announced that every ticket holder will receive a limited edition NFT of the FTX arena, after the ticket is scanned. When a twitter user called out Mark Cuban that he is suprised Miami Heat beat the Dallas Mavericks to NFT tickets. Cuban responded with a couple of tweets suggestion NFTs for the first Dallas Mavericks home game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n0mmki1lafv71.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b5d7b0940ded38236cc4ddf8b0fe3dd42788e37\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n6lr2lbnafv71.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b18d88fd101e8ba453825afc9c77d8b85eaf286\n\n**Benefits of NFT tickets include:**\n\n**Collectible** \\- Tickets become tradable digital collectibles (NFTs), with a variety of awesome possibilities for fans & event organizers. (most adoption of NFT tickets is currently happening in this area))\n\n**Increased profitability** \\- Total control and insights over the primary & secondary market. Take in the profit that would have gone to scalpers.\n\n**Unrivalled data** \\- Clear, verifiable data on ticket ownership, vastly improving marketing efforts.\n\n**Pre - financing events** \u2013 using tickets as colleteral to finance events leveraging the benefits of DeFi and NFTs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d4r8ulwoafv71.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=31ef497952d3fd7ce699d761555fcb71b6ee2f00\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cuban**\n\nCuban has said the Mavericks were trying to find a good option for turning our tickets into NFTs. He is interested in increasing the revenue from ticket sales and maximizing the experience for fan using NFTs. The possibillity to ask royalties on NFT tickets is a great feature to increase revenue from ticket sales by getting a royality on secondary market sales. Cuban noticed season ticketholders will sell their tickets for a few high demand to pay for their wholse season ticket package. With a royality fee on NFT tickets sold on secondary market sales, the Mavericks will profit aswell from secondary market sales.\n\n**Adoptiong is already happening**\n\nmajor ticketing companies like **Ticketmaster and Seatgeek** are actively working on implementing NFT ticketing. Ticketmaster recently launched a FAQ for its NFT ticket marketplace. Seatgeek hired a blockchain executive as VP of engineering and Seatgeek plans to roll out NFT ticketing for the NFL and NBA.\n\nWhich projects are working on NFT ticketing?\n\n**GET protocol \u2013 50m usd (+- rank 600 coingecko)**\n\n**GET protocol** has been working on blockchian ticketing since 2016 and had its ICO in 2017. GET protocol offers existing and new ticketing companies tools to easily implement NFT ticketing. GET protocol has recently crossed the **1 million NFT tickets sold** mark. **9 ticketing companies** are using GET protocols NFT ticketing solution so far. The recently announced YourTicketProvider, which sells 2 million tickets annually. What I really like is that all tickets can be tracked on NFT ticket explorer.\n\n[https://explorer.get-protocol.io/](https://explorer.get-protocol.io/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v7b8rqugafv71.jpg?width=862&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ae023a3ce84d6d12725d291e56b8f7f51bbd940\n\nFurthermore, the tokenomics of GET protocol create value for tokenholders. Ticketing companies that use GET protocol for NFT ticketing need to buy GET from the openmarket. The GET tokens that paid for usage of the protocol get transferred to the DAO. Tokenholders decide what happens with the funds of the DAO (burn the token, marketing etc). This proces is currently done manually. Automated on-chain tokenomics is currently in the last test phasing and will likely be announced at the end of the month. A technical overview of the flow of tokens used as fuel for the GET protocol can be read from the link below.\n\n[https://docs.get-protocol.io/docs/dao-token-economics-overview](https://docs.get-protocol.io/docs/dao-token-economics-overview)\n\nI am not aware of any other crypto projects with an own token that focus on NFT ticketing and have significant adoption. There are some projects without a token focus on NFT tickeing, like YellowHeart and NFT.kreds\n\n**sources**\n\n**Miami Heat season opener**\n\n[https://www.local10.com/sports/2021/10/22/everyone-seated-at-the-miami-heat-season-opener-received-a-free-cryptocurrency-nft/](https://www.local10.com/sports/2021/10/22/everyone-seated-at-the-miami-heat-season-opener-received-a-free-cryptocurrency-nft/)\n\n**Ted Leonsis**\n\n[https://sports.yahoo.com/ted-leonsis-sees-blockchain-future-095533212.html](https://sports.yahoo.com/ted-leonsis-sees-blockchain-future-095533212.html)\n\n**Mark Cuban**\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-mark-cuban-wants-turn-151934328.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-mark-cuban-wants-turn-151934328.html)\n\n**Seatgeek**\n\n[https://sports.yahoo.com/seatgeek-talks-roll-nft-prototype-095538749.html](https://sports.yahoo.com/seatgeek-talks-roll-nft-prototype-095538749.html)\n\n[https://sporttechie.com/seatgeek-hires-blockchain-executive-as-vp-of-engineering/](https://sporttechie.com/seatgeek-hires-blockchain-executive-as-vp-of-engineering/)\n\n**Ticketmaster NFT ticket marketplace**\n\n[https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/topic/0TO6Q0000000xDgWAI/nft-marketplace-support?language=en\\_US](https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/topic/0TO6Q0000000xDgWAI/nft-marketplace-support?language=en_US)\n\n**Yourticketprovider news 2m NFT tickets**\n\n[https://www.iq-mag.net/2021/08/your-ticket-provider-nft-ticketing/](https://www.iq-mag.net/2021/08/your-ticket-provider-nft-ticketing/)\n\n(ticketing magazine)\n\n**Polygon partnership**\n\n[https://medium.com/get-protocol/scaling-the-nft-ticketing-use-case-globally-get-protocol-x-polygon-7d5094864a80](https://medium.com/get-protocol/scaling-the-nft-ticketing-use-case-globally-get-protocol-x-polygon-7d5094864a80)\n\n**Chainlink VRF partnership**\n\n[https://medium.com/get-protocol/get-protocol-integrates-chainlink-vrf-to-further-improve-blockchain-ticketing-solution-864c7056e73d](https://medium.com/get-protocol/get-protocol-integrates-chainlink-vrf-to-further-improve-blockchain-ticketing-solution-864c7056e73d)",

            "text": "I don\u2019t know if you are familiar with the concept of \"PlayToEarn\" games. For me it is quite new, I always try the Play For Free, and avoid the Pay2Win. But with some games you can actually make money through NFT and crypto rewards in the game.\n\nMany people already know projects like Axie Infinity, or Splinterlands (you can make around 20$/month very easily just by playing). Very good projects, in which you have the opportunity to make some money, although first you may need to invest some money yourself.\n\nThere are more games, probably hundreds. Town Star is also a very solid project, for me it became a bit boring and repetitive, but if you are willing to dedicate a lot of time, you can really earn money.\n\nIn all these cases, the only thing that I don\u2019t like is that the people who played it from the beginning have a huge advantage over the rest.\n\nThat\u2019s why I want to talk about some projects that have not been released yet, they are in an early stage, and therefore it may be a good idea to jump in before they are released and get famous:\n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m not promising they will get famous, I have no commercial interest,, I\u2019m not related to the developers, no hidden intentions, if you don\u2019t like the projects feel free to say it in the comments. Probably there are more promising projects like these, if I don\u2019t mention more it is because I don\u2019t know them deeply and therefore I cannot make a proper review.\n\nSTARCHI\n\nMy favorite part about this game is how it\u2019s inspired by Tamagotchi. So basically you get a Starchi that you take care of and in return they give you rewards for it. You can then go to battle with your Starchi which gives you even more rewards. The graphics aren't too crazy, meaning you won\u2019t need an RTX for it. But it\u2019s charming and adorable, it really makes me feel nostalgic. Their team is actively doing giveaways too. You can find their giveaways on Twitter, Discord, Youtube and Telegram. The game will be released around the end of October. \n\n[https://starchi.gg/](https://starchi.gg/?r=1)\n\nMIST NFT\n\nAFAIK it will be a kind of Diablo RPG, but with a tradeable NFT. The beta is planned for the Q3 of 2021 (although only available for few people that will be selected), and the release of the game for early 2022, I think (you can check the roadmap on the link I post below). The graphics of the sneak peek, so far, look good, the community is growing, and the investors seem reliable. There is not much information about the developers, though, but looking at what they have already shown, it is a game that I think I will like to play, I\u2019m looking forward to the release. If I have to say something negative, it is that unlike the other NFT games I mentioned (Town Star, Splinterlands, Astral Entities. I am not saying that strategy is not important, but other gaming skills are not), this is a proper game where your reflexes and ability is in place, not just a \u201cclick\u201d game, and this may move out some kids or, let\u2019s say, not-skilled players who prefer easy games. But for me, this is actually a plus (one of the reasons I stopped playing Town Star is this).\n\n[https://mist.game/](https://mist.game/)\n\nASTRAL ENTITIES\n\nThis is not a game, but a series of games, sharing the same background. I think it is planned for the end of 2021/begining of 2022, but more info can be found in the Discord and the web (link below). Things I like about this project is that the whole multiverse is based in the story books of one of the developers, Tanzo, who has already created a nice story, characters, lands\u2026 and now this will be introduced to the games. Other things that I like about the project is the community on Discord, but overall, that they are promoting the game(s) by contest, trivial, quests,\u2026 in which you can get, for free, NFT\u2019s that will be used later in the games, and even you can already sell some of these NFT\u2019s in the market. So, if you like the concept, I would recommend joining the discord and stay tuned in the announcements. I already got 3 different NFT\u2019s for free that can be traded in the market. \n\n[https://www.astralentities.com/the-plan](https://www.astralentities.com/the-plan)",

What are its Features?\n\nStrongNodeEdge Technology is the future of edge networking leveraging blockchain. The technology focuses on solving inefficiencies by moving the processing of data closer to the edge, towards the end-users. They are delivering an on-demand, secure, and scalable node technology that will fundamentally reshape the future of how increasingly valuable compute resources are accessed and monetized. \n\n# What is StrongNode \u201cNetwork Effect\u201d? \n\nSNE maximizes idle resources and repurpose them on demand for a symbiotic relationship between node partners (providers) and node clients (users) to produce a \u201cNetwork Effect\u201d  and grow the ecosystem.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vd5lpk1jgsw71.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=d71cfbc9d9738e805738d12bfa586bb63d58af19\n\n# What are the Practical Applications of StrongNode?\n\nStrongNode NaaS technology have applications in hypergrowth industries such as, but not limited to: AI, Machine Learning, Gaming, Telecommunications, and Medical Industry.\n\n# What's the project roadmap? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8h4oxk1kgsw71.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b1dad1853db2fa2647e2f919c5c84a41e8c1593\n\n# $SNE Token Utility\n\n1. Node Enterprise Users pay for services via different methods: Traditional methods, via the $SNE token, or a combination of both (with a lot of incentives to use $SNE).\n2. Node Seeder Users get $SNE for providing their idle resources (CPU/GPU, bandwidth, storage).\n3. Staked $SNE to get token sale access from StrongNode Innovation Lab projects.\n4. Staked $SNE can earn other Innovation Lab and partner project tokens.\n5. Governance through staked token. The DAO will control the direction of where some treasury strategies and where the philanthropic fund distributes the contributions.\n6. Will have a separate contract to handle NFT interactions, especially for StrongNode ID.\n7. Farming Users can single stake for 1, 3, 6, 12 month options. Will have also a yield aggregator that maximizes returns on partner farms.\n\n# They've got a lot more info on their TG and website. This project is lit but better DYOR before diving in.

In short, they are pioneering a new paradigm in digital connectivity.\n\n# What are the Practical Applications of StrongNode?\n\nStrongNode NaaS technology have applications in hypergrowth industries such as, but not limited to AI, Machine Learning, Gaming, Telecommunications, and Medical Industry.\n\n# What is their token's utility ($SNE)?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uvjgam8uznu71.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=049f967778626c36325447af64c61724ca1818c0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e3llvwzuznu71.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9637622a8bb9bccd09cca7563410fa97887a0ad3\n\n1. Node Enterprise Users pay for services via different methods: Traditional methods, via the $SNE token, or a combination of both (with a lot of incentives to use $SNE). Whatever $SNE token is needed to pay the Node Seeders will be bought back and distributed to Node Seeders.\n2. Node Seeder Users get $SNE for providing their idle resources (CPU/GPU, bandwidth, storage).\n3. Stake $SNE to get token sale access from StrongNode Innovation Lab projects.\n4. Staked $SNE can earn other Innovation Lab and partner project tokens.\n5. Governance through staked token. The DAO will control the direction of where some treasury strategies and where the philanthropic fund distributes the contributions.\n6. Will have a separate contract to handle NFT interactions, especially for StrongNode ID.\n7. Farming Users can single stake for 1, 3, 6, 12 month options. They also have a yield aggregator that maximizes returns on partner farms.\n\n# What is their roadmap? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1nqbebzvznu71.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=c02591fa3622c7f1544a0a0fb18775c68fb9732b\n\n# StrongNode Edge's IDO Launch will be Today, October 21, at 15:00 UTC.\n\n***Reminder: This is not a financial advice, always do your own research. You may check their website to know more about the project. See you, Noders!***",

Blockchain games make P2E possible by combining DeFi and NFTs with serious gameplay, and gamers earn serious crypto rewards for their gaming\u2014the more gamers game, the more gamers earn.\n\n\nStrongNode is working to power the blockchain that makes these kinds of games possible through their revolutionary edge computing solutions for operating nodes in distributed networks. In addition, they\u2019re uniting communities and lending a hand to senior gamers so they can join in on the lucrative fun.\n\nThe momentum of StrongNode\u2019s infrastructure-as-service success will hopefully propel seasoned gamers and veterans towards a higher quality of life through OGLife. In essence, while StrongNode is connecting networks of devices, this startup is also in the business of connecting people and thriving-as-service.\n\n**Bottomline..**\n\nThe combination of the gaming and social aspects in a project like OGLife should help accelerate the adoption of StrongNode\u2019s services. As the StrongNode.io ecosystem continues to grow, the $SNE token, which will be necessary to access pre-launch OGLife tokens, will surely become a well sought-after crypto asset.\n\n **You can visit their website or join you can join their Telegram.

            "text": "Social trading crypto exchange, Bingbon continues to spread cheer in its 3rd anniversary with a trading competition that has gone underway on May 20. Called \u2018Profit Ranking Competition,\u2019 the multi-stage event will end on June 17 when participating individuals and teams compete for a generous prize pool.\n\nSingapore-based Bingbon has released details of its trading competition earlier this month, stating that lucky winners will be rewarded with USDT and non-fungible tokens. Bingbon\u2019s newest tournament will follow the standard format in ranking participants by their overall profit or popularity listing. \n\nThe contest is split into two rounds, and a maximum of $198,000 has been placed up for grabs during the four-week event. Only users with an account balance of 30 USDT or higher can take part.\n\nThe preliminary round of Profit Ranking Competition consists of three phases, each lasting one week. The top 30 contestants in the first phase, ranked by profit amount, will automatically secure their spot in the final round. \n\nFor the second phase, the top 60 candidates will be rewarded with non-fungible tokens. A total of 500 limited NFT collections were minted exclusively for the winners in order to provide another layer of earning potential for those who perform well. NFTs winners can keep their tokens or sell them back to Bingbon for Tether.\n\nThe third phase of the preliminary round follows suit with the top 5 candidates claiming between 500 and 5,000 USDT depending on their ranking. Further, 100 candidates selected in the preliminary round by the popularity race will automatically advance to the final round.\n\nMore prizes as traders assemble in teams\nAlthough the trading contest is very much an event for individual traders, teams also will gain a larger share of their squad\u2019s pot according to their own popularity margins. This means that if one team member does well, the rest of the team\u2019s popularity scores will benefit. Conversely, however, one underperforming trader could drag the whole team down.\n\nSpecifically, at the end of the final round, there will be a separate award for the three most popular teams who compete to win the highest reward of 45,000 USDT. The top team will earn two-thirds of the total prize pool \u2013 which could mean a handsome $30,000. The second and third-placed teams will claim $10,000 and $5,000 respectively.\n\nMoving fast to the final round, which runs from June 10 to June 17, contestants will compete for the grand prize of 50,000 USDT granted for the first-place winner. The runner-up of the pot and third place winner will take home $20,000, while the fourth-place will get $10,000. Other contenders who round out the top ten will earn $1,000 each.\n\nBingbon\u2019s contest reflects a growing industry trend to attract the interest of novice and professional traders with similar competitions.  \n\nLaunched in 2018 and based in Singapore, the crypto derivatives trading platform is dedicated to providing professional trading services. Unlike most of its competitors, Bingbon not only provides cryptocurrency trading, but also mainstream investment products, as well as a copy trading function for passive income. Their catalog covers digital assets, stock indices, commodities, and forex with up to 150x leverage.\n\nOne of Bingbon\u2019s major selling points is that it offers a demo trading account, which allows newcomers to explore trading before putting their real money on the line.\n\n\n\n[Source](http://trade.newsoftheworld.club)",

For some it was just ordinary arts with no use case attached, while for others it was all about building a brand. NFTs have been ruling since their emergence as they diversified into gaming, which gave rise to NFT gaming to earn trend. \n\nWhat could be the next big thing?\nPersonally, I've been following these trends for some time now, and I boldly say that the people who make the most money are the ones who follow the trend - with no emotions attached to the market of token or hype. Just ride the wave\n\n\nThe next big thing in this space will probably be the metaverse and web 3.0 projects. I think there could be a combined trend because some people right now are using the metaverse as an alternative to move away from their current lives, where everything is basically controlled by rules, centralization and old web 2.0.\nCommunication is an important aspect of the metaverse and Sylo will be a great tool to usher us into the new world of decentralized web. \n\nSylo Network is well positioned to provide the robust, decentralised infrastructure that the Metaverse needs.\nAutonomous, p2p, e2ee, and run by the community for the community, the Sylo Network can ensure that the Metaverse is decentralised. \n\nWhat Sylo offers the digital worlds of NFT projects in the Metaverse is the ability to chat, call, video call, buy, sell, send, receive, browse, play, and notify each other with the same UX and reliability that you could expect in a walled garden, except, out in the decentralised wild. With the Sylo app, you can send NFTs to another user with just one click, so grandma who likes the image of a bored ape can easily receive one as a birthday present without even knowing what blockchain is. \n\nThe Sylo SDK has the power to connect individuals, groups, communities, and worlds in a decentralised manner. It can be said as the place where the metaverse comes together. \n\nDelegated staking is rolling out for SYLO in the coming weeks which is massive addition to the network and a great opportunity to earn while supporting the project via nodes. \n\nLet me know your thoughts on the metaverse and how big of a trend you think it can become.",

Let\u2019s play this blockchain game!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not how it\u2019s going to work. This premise won\u2019t fly until gamers say, \u201cThis blockchain game is so cool! Oh, hey, neat, I guess I really own my digital items?\u201d\n\n Gamers want to play great games. If they can get additional benefits out of playing, great, but it needs to be a great game first and foremost. Play-to-Earn will always feel more like work-to-earn as long as the game is boring compared to distractions available on platforms such as the PlayStation or Nintendo Switch.\n\n**NFTs and Video Games**: The Next Big Thing? **Decentraland** co-founder Ari Meilich is launching a new game company named \u201c**Big Time Studios**,\" which has raised $10.3 million from prominent investors like Sam Bankman-Fried, Ashton Kutcher, Digital Currency Group, and Circle. \u201cThe Hash\u201d panel discusses the potential evolution of video games and their intersection with the non-fungible token (NFT) market. Volume 90% \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I was working on this post, I went and watched a few videos for the upcoming game **Chainmonsters**, from **Dapper Labs**, the company Crunchbase credits with $357 million in investment. The game is still in alpha, it should be noted, and it\u2019s updating all the time, including recently slicking up its graphics.But the game is basically one where you wander around a world gathering up little monsters, playing them in fights to increase their experience and make more badass monsters. What does that sound like? It sounds like Pok\u00e9mon. \n\nNext on the list is one of the most awaited game for the year, I am talking about none other than **Vulcan verse** which is all set to launch on 25th July 2021.  \n\n\nVulcanVerse is a virtual world set in the Greco-Roman era. It is a stand-alone game that uses blockchain technology to enable users to truly own their land and assets. Its detailed lore is written by the authors of Fighting Fantasy, a series of successful single-player role-playing gamebooks created by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone. Additionally, the virtual world boasts complex gaming tools and multiplayer game-playing functionalities. \n\nVulcanVerse is blockchain-based, with key items in the virtual world existing as NFTs on a purpose-built blockchain. Its virtual world can be accessed via a downloadable application that recently became available on Google's Play Store. \n\n \n\nIt\u2019s hard to describe, in a good way.\n\nSo crypto will need to make something comparably impressive and drop immutable in-game items somewhere in its guts before gamers really get excited about this industry. It takes a lot of money and a lot of talent to put together a game that really captures gamers\u2019 attention, but a few people in this industry have made a little money, or so I\u2019m told.\n\nSo far, the blockchain gaming offerings have largely been slightly lower fidelity derivatives of past video game blockbusters, as if entrepreneurs in this space lack conviction that a truly original, crypto native game can be really good.",

I was thinking about going full ETH maxi, but the gas is starting to really bum me out. The way I see it, a blockchain needs to be able to overcome the two main criticisms of the technology: environmental sustainability and scalability.\n\nWhen it comes to sustainability, you can pretty much write off any PoW chains. Proof of stake seems to be the most promising low carbon consensus mechanism, but I\u2019m open to suggestions for an alternative form.  \nWhen it comes to scalability, I think the question of throughput is the most important factor. As blockchains expand from defi and NFTs into gaming, VR/metaverse, and general purpose data platforms, throughput and TPS are becoming limiting factors to mass adoption. Similar to my proof of stake persuasions, I believe sharding to be the most promising way forward for blockchains, but can be convinced otherwise.\n\nHarmony was ostensibly the first sharded, proof-of-stake blockchain. But it\u2019s pretty far down the stack and I don\u2019t anticipate it overtaking ETH before they figure out their throughput issues. NEAR Protocol\u2019s [sharding announcement ](https://medium.com/nearprotocol/near-launches-nightshade-sharding-paving-the-way-for-mass-adoption-b17066fbc330?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------)today seems to lay the groundwork for infinite scalability, plus they are carbon neutral and PoS, but I don\u2019t want to put all my eggs in one basket.  \nSo my question is: Which chains show the most promise in terms of sustainability and scalability from your perspective? Are there any other PoS / sharded chains I should look into, or should I evolve beyond my PoS / Sharding chauvinism? DIscuss...",

Don't take it as investment advice:\n\n1.  **Bitcoin (BTC)** and **Ethereum (ETH)**; pressure grows for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other traditional financial instruments to invest in BTC and ETH.\n2. **DeFi** will go more mainstream than ever. Projects like **Aave, Terra** or **Ramp** will gain more notoriety.\n3. **NFTs** will have a massive growth. Already some economic stupides point out to that. 2022 will see a massive rise in the millions for NFTs. More sports teams and players will get involved. Projects like **Rario Marketplace, Socios** or **Opensea** will increase the value, more than double.\n4. **Stablecoins** become a fixture in the crypto sphere. The more mainstream crypto goes, the more good stablecoin projects will be needed. Assets like DAI or eMoney portfolio of stablecoins will grow bigger.\n5. **Data driven protocols** will get more mainstream adoption.  The risks of big data can be divided into **security issues** and **ethical issues.** Projects like **Ocean Protocol** or **The Graph** will gain more mainstream attention due to new data based security problems.\n\nYour thoughts?

By investing in metaverse coins, you will be embarking on a life-long investment path. Consider not only your own profits, but also the profits of your children and grandchildren.\n\nSome coins are extremely popular right now, and for good reason. I'm not including the usual suspects like decentraland and sandbox, so I've added two new options. one in the gaming industry, and the other in community development\nEach metaverse has its own purpose; some are attempting to create a corporate community, while others are using it to play games. We still don't know what the metaverse's true potential is.\n\nSome metaverses, such as alienworlds, may simply be places where people go to get their fix and have fun. Some people may prefer to live a peaceful second life in the metaverse rather than be a part of this frenzy.\n\nSimilarly, Metakawn, a Modern Muslim community-focused project, as well as nfts in terms of their community. This is the First Metaverse for Modern Muslims generation with a Halal EcoSystem who share the same values.

Meanwhile, crypto users get paid in crypto which is\n1. Highly lucrative provided you know what you\u2019re doing \n2. Based on the American dollar \n\nAs a result, all my friends who work in crypto online get paid with real money, meanwhile my father, a freaking doctor, gets paid less inflated currency. Something is seriously wrong here. It\u2019s not just that crypto is amazing at what it does, it\u2019s that banks and governments are awful at what they do. The relationship weakens the latter and strengthens the former. This is painfully obvious to me, but I wish my father saw it earlier. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not flexing on my father. At the end of the day, my money is his money, and his money is my money. There\u2019s no distinction there. I\u2019m just sad it had to come to this at the end of the day. \n\nNeedless to say, I invest heavily. Lately, I have invested my time and money into NFT games and have been making a real well profit off games like Axie and Kitty Kart, and I\u2019m pushing my friends to join me too! I want to help out my community as much as possible. \n\n I hate to see this happen to the country I know and love and will invest my good time and effort into helping out as much as possible.",

            "text": "**WHAT IS NFT?**\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are cryptocurrency assets on a blockchain in which each token is unique. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, NFT cannot be exchanged but can be used as Art. Hence the word Non-Fungible. They can be bought on the NFT market and can get tracked on their blockchains. NFTs are created by uploading a file to an NFT auction market which produces a hash of the file on blockchain as an NFT and can then be bought and resold with cryptocurrency. NFT usually has very little data stored in it. But it contains details which are links to where Art about it is preserved. As an NFT buyer, you do not have exclusive access to the work also, the original file will not be in your possession. Anyone can upload an NFT work. You do not necessarily have to be the original artist to upload a file. Even though NFTs would be favored for their authenticity, over a hundred copies can be made from it and then sold.\n\nThe NFTs artwork possesses similarities to autographed works because of its uniqueness. NFTs can be offered as collectibles in a digital form. Several popular brands have used NFT over time. In 2019, Nike created a system that would use NFT called Cryptokicks to verify a shoe's originality and translate virtual versions to customers. Nike's works proved that NFTs are not for digital arts only. They can also be used for regular utilities like;\n\nVideo games, 3D images, 2D images, event tickets, blog articles, cards, tokenized assets that aren't virtual like lands, buildings, music.\n\nAlthough there have been serious controversies about the use of NFT due to its high energy burning during blockchain transactions, NFTs are still very much in use today.\n\nThere are several ways you can make money with NFT. Let us start by showing you how to create an NFT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How can you create an NFT?**\n\nThe technical word for creating an NFT is \"minting\" it. To create an NFT, you should:\n\nSelect your token standard- you can either use the ERC721, the token standard for the Ethereum blockchain, or ERC1155, the Enjin blockchain. The Enjin blockchain is very complex because of its properties which can allow for the creation of several NFTs. It also works well for the specification of NFTs. There are other blockchains that can be used like;\n\nBinance Smart Chain, Flow by Dapper Labs, Tron, EOS, Polkadot, Tezos, Cosmos, WAX\n\nMake sure you install a browser that uses any of the blockchains you select. Each blockchain has its own NFT standard, wallet service, and marketplace. For example, if you create an NFT with a Tron blockchain. That means you can only sell them on platforms that support Tron. This means you would not be able to sell them on platforms like VIV3, a flow-based marketplace or Open sea, an Ethereum based marketplace.\n\nSince Ethereum is the most used and has the most extensive NFT system, it's advisable to install an Ethereum browser like Trust Wallet, MetaMask, or even Coin base.\n\nBuy Ethereum. Depending on the browser you're using, you can buy Ethereum in several ways. You can purchase using the Luno app. Buy about $50-$100 worth of Ethereum.\n\nConnect your wallet and upload the file you want to turn to an NFT\u2013 there are 3 Ethereum leading marketplace, they are;\n\nOpenSea. - OpenSea is currently the largest Ethereum NFT marketplace, and here's how it works ;\n\n\\- Click on the create button\n\n\\- Connect your Ethereum based wallet\n\n\\- Enter wallet password\n\n\\- On the create button on your right, select \"my collection\".\n\n\\- Add a name and a description of the file you want to upload\n\n\\- Insert an image for your collection\n\n\\- Now click on the \"add new item\" button. You'll reach a window where you can upload.\n\n\\- Upload your image or file.\n\n\\- OpenSea has the option to include special traits in your NFT so include whatever you want to.\n\n\\- Once you're done, click on the \"create\" button at the bottom and sign another message in your wallet to confirm the creation of the NFT. The artwork should appear in your collection when you check.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What does it cost to create NFTs?**\n\nTo create NFTs on OpenSea, it costs nothing, but on some other Ethereum based marketplace, they charge a fee known as \"gas\" fee. The gas fee is simply the amount in Ethereum you would need to perform certain functions or carry out certain transactions on the blockchain. The gas fee depends on the network and traffic congestion. The more the people transacting at a time, the more the gas fee and vice versa. It's advised to conduct transactions very early during the day or late at night. The gas fee is also considerably low on weekends.\n\n**How To Earn With NFTs**\n\nYou can earn with NFT by either buying or selling NFTs on several marketplaces.\n\nBuying And Selling Of NFTs\n\n***\\* How To Buy***\u2013\n\nThere are certain things that you need to consider before rushing to buy NFT;\n\n\\- The marketplace you intend to buy It from\n\n\\- The wallet you would download to connect with the platform and buy\n\n\\- The cryptocurrency you would use to fund your wallet and buy NFT.\n\n\\- If the NFTs are being sold at a certain time\n\nCertain NFTs are not as available as others. You would have to buy them from specific platforms. You will need to create an account with whichever platform such NFT is and try to determine if it's sold out. NFTs such as these are usually scarce. And are only available for a specific period. The \"pack and art drops\" system is used for really short NFTs, and it helps generate more money. So buyers would fund their account prior to the availability of the product and then try to buy it once it's available. This is because pack and art drops tend to end quickly. And it can be over in less than a minute. There are several NFT marketplaces all over the world. Here are some of them;\n\nOpenSea, Rarible, Nifty Gateway, Axie marketplace, Super rare, VIV3, BakerySwap, Foundation, NFT ShowRoom.\n\n***\\* How To Sell\u2013***\n\nTo sell your NFTs, you have to locate the \"my collections button\", click on it, and then click on \"sell\". When you click on this, you will be taken to a page for pricing where you can determine whether to run an auction or simply just sell at a fixed price.\n\nYou can sell your NFTs for Ethereum or any other cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Although some platforms only support tokens, they are based on. So you can sell for the platform-based token.\n\nRoyalties allow NFT creators to earn a commission, thereby generating a standard income every time the asset is sold to a different person. This has the potential to create passive income streams for artists and other content creators automatically using a smart contract for life.\n\nOn some platforms, there might be a need to pay a certain fee in order for you to list your NFT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What are the Problems with NTFs?**\n\nAs with any new technology, NFT has its own downsides and drawbacks. They are:\n\n1. Theft: Due to the lack of restrictions on copyright, there can be a significant theft issue. Artists and sellers can find out that their Art is on a marketplace and sold without their permission or knowledge. In the art world, however, the owners of NFTs (which, in most cases, are digital artists and fine artists) have very little control over how and where their work is sold. The primary value of NFT is that the proof of work makes sure that your original piece has a unique token attached to it, which means that the owner knows that they have the 'original'. But the main problem is that someone can take a JPG and upload it on a different platform and then claim there's no original copy. To avoid theft or being ripped off, artists should dig into platforms that actively promote original work and curate the pieces they sell.\n2. Money flows barriers: it is harder to move money around with NFT.\n3. Environmental Restrictions: operating in the same environment and platform becomes outdated. Artists would need a better way of making sales and getting paid. The whole Ethereum decentralized system works well enough but takes time to be activated. Also, electricity and carbon burned to complete a transaction is really high and might cause environmental health issues.\n\nNFTS has been sold for far costlier prices than other techs. These are the 3 most expensive NFTs ever sold:\n\n\\- February 25, 2021, Trevor Jones sold 4,157 editions of his painting Bitcoin Angel for $777 each over just seven minutes.\n\n\\- Mad Dog Jones topped Beeple's December drop when two open editions NFTs brought in $3.9 million, selling for $2,500 and $5,000 apiece.\n\n\\- Claire \"Grimes\" Boucher entered the NFT arena with splash, dropping \"WarNymph Collection Vol. 1,\". The entire series was sold out within 20 minutes.\n\nLet me know what you guys think?\n\n[Here's the link to the original article and more like this](https://sites.google.com/view/makemoneyonlinegoal/what-are-nfts-and-how-can-you-take-advantage-of-it?authuser=0)",

            "text": "# Introduction\n\nYou've seen GET Protocol mentioned here and there, perhaps you've heard about their mission to become the worldwide protocol standard for ticketing, heck you might've used them unknowingly when you went to an event (like Cosmoverse) lately. There's people enthousiastic about GET Protocol and using it, but you don't really know what they do. In this post I'm going to give you a quick overview of the problems they aim to solve and their solution.\n\n* Do note that there's much more to tell, but then it wouldn't be quick anymore.\n* There's a few links I like to share but they seem to get autodeleted so I'll post them in a comment.\n* Summary at the bottom for those that dislike large posts.\n\n# Which industry is GET Protocol aiming for?\n\nGET Protocol is aiming at disrupting the Ticketing Industry. The Ticketing Industry is basically comprised of event organisers, fans/customers, ticketeers, venues, and, regretfully, scalpers as well.\n\n>The goal of the Ticketing Industry is to get the fan/customer to buy a ticket to visit an artist or other event, spending money at the venue if applicable.\n\nThere's a primary market and secondary market for tickets. The primary market is the market where the event organiser controls the ticket price by selling through ticketeers, while the secondary market is the market where tickets are resold by would-be attendees and ~~scalpers~~ ticket touts.\n\n# Which problems does the Ticketing Industry face?\n\nEver bought a ticket to a famous artist or event? You stood in the digital queue for half an hour with no success, only to read the newspaper later on saying \"Artist X tickets sold out within 2 minutes!\". You take to secondary market options and what do you know, hundreds if not thousands of tickets available for you to purchase for that famous artist or event! There's just this tiny footnote however; The tickets have at least trippled in price. Furthermore, you don't even know if the ticket you bought is valid or not!\n\n[We've all been there at least once. Scalpers are the scum of the Ticketing Industry.](https://preview.redd.it/3yybpx107jz71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=30edaa8d6d51efed839549518a25d9070b2220dd)\n\nWhile scalping and fake tickets are already massive problems on their own, it turned out certain ticketeers themselves have joined the scalper side of things. It turned out Ticketmaster (one of the, if not the, biggest ticketeer known) collaborates with ticket touts, giving them a percentage of the tickets to sell on the secondary ticket market. That means a certain percentage of tickets for an event were **never even up for sale on the primary market**. This lack of transparancy is yet another issue the Ticketing Industry faces.\n\nOn the other side of the Ticketing Industry sit the venues and event organisers. Since the secondary market is basically a free-for-all, venues and event organisers (i.e. artists) do not know who bought tickets on the secondary market. This means there's no connection between venues/artists and customers/fans, which in turn means the venues/artists don't know who their audience is and if the right people are reached. This lack of insight is less apparent for ticketbuyers, but nonetheless an issue the Ticketing Industry faces.\n\nAlthough the above is quite substantial already and there's much more going on, I'll go with one last issue to keep this brief; Merch selling at venues. Artists are the ones doing the work, the ones fans/customers come to an event for. These artists often sell merch at the venues. What you probably don't realise is that the venue takes a large piece of the merche income for allowing the artist to sell merch at the venue. Depending on the artists and piece taken, this could mean a serious cut in income for the artist.\n\nWhile scalping, fake tickets and lack of transparancy take the bulk of it, all in all there's a lot askew within the Ticketing Industry.\n\n# How does GET Protocol aim to solve these?\n\nGET Protocol itself is, well, a protocol. This protocol is basically an ecosystem the tickets dwell in, tickets can never leave the ecosystem. How they create that ecosystem is written below under \"Grant insight in the secondary market\".\n\n>The GET Protocol is the backend using blockchain technology to register and verify ownership of a ticket and provide transparency to the ticketing cycle.\n\nThe protocol uses the $GET token as fuel for any interaction with the blockchain; buying, selling, reselling, scanning, claiming or invalidating a ticket. This ensures a common way of interacting with the protocol no matter where the ticketeer is from. There's a bunch of other benefits to the token, but I won't go into them here.\n\nThe protocol combines a bunch of techniques to provide transparancy, make scalping impossible, make fake tickets impossible, grant more insight in the secondary market and do something about merch income cuts. Let's go at them one by one.\n\n**Provide transparancy**  \nBlockchain itself provides much needed transparancy. After all, every transaction is visible to everyone. Apart from that the protocol aims at providing transparancy wherever it goes.Take queueing for example. While usually you have no idea whether or not the queue was created fairly, with GET Protocol you can verify it thanks to their integration of Chainlink's VRF which provides verifiable randomness.Another example is their ticket explorer, that gives you real time insight in the ticket statistics. Or their subgraph that lets you query the protocol usage in-dept.\n\n**Make scalping & fake tickets impossible**  \nBy linking a ticket to a SIM card and phone, the genuine owner of a ticket can be verified. GET Protocol combines this with a dynamic QR code to prevent selling the ticket outside their ecosystem, thus avoiding ticket fraud. This solves the fake ticket problem as well; there's simply no way to (re)sell a ticket other than through their ecosystem.\n\n**Grant insight in the secondary market**  \nThis is an important one because it's a result of the ecosystem GET Protocol created. By merging the primary market and secondary market together, the GET Protocol closed ecosystem is created. Both markets are regulated by the protocol and while there's a distinction between the markets, the tickets gained from both markets are **exactly the same**.\n\nSince the secondary market is an integrated part of the closed ecosystem, the protocol (and therefore the event organisers and venues) knows who a ticket has been resold to.\n\n**Do something about merch income cuts**  \nSince the tickets are fully digital and provide a 'right of entrance', merch can be sold alongside a ticket to an event. That's what's called upsells. By allowing fans/customers to buy merch as upsells you not only remove the need of selling at the venue, but also the issue of limited merch.\n\n# Some more added value, a little thing called NFTs\n\nBesides a way to solve existing issues, the protocol also aims at adding extra value to the ticketing usecase. A big example of that is NFT ticketing. Every ticket sold through the protocol is an NFT and can be claimed after the event. Besides being able to now claim a digital collectible much like you could with traditional paper tickets, this also opens new possibilities.\n\nOne of these is the ability to buy and sell your tickets, which you can do on the opensea market. Certain events, certain seatnumbers, might be worth something after the event. In fact, the ticket itself may have some added value after the event.\n\nNFT tickets open up a lot of possibilities for fan<>artist interactions. Think about randomly making a few out of all event tickets have special perks like VIP access. Think about airdropping a special NFT among the attendees during the event. Think about giving free merch or discounts to those with multiple NFTs of a given artists, or even a backstage pass for the biggest fans.\n\nAn event ends after you went home, but with NFT tickets this doesn't have to be the end of your experience. Your NFT ticket could give you access to a metaverse event for example. Evolving NFTs is another prime example. Imagine going to a beer festival and getting an evolving NFT. Besides it evolving depending on the beers you drink, it could also further evolve when you go to another beer festival that accepts the same NFT!\n\nThe possibilities for NFT tickets are endless. If you wish to know more about this specific usecase (news, other projects), I highly recommend checking out the subreddit \"NFTTickets\".\n\n# GET Protocol's solutions\n\nWhile the protocol itself works as the backend, the team behind GET Protocol has thought about ways for ticketeers to easily implement this backend. They have created 2 products; one aimed at new ticketeers and ticketeers seeking a full package, the other at existing ticketeers wishing to dip their toes in fully digital NFT tickets.\n\n**White Label (WL)**  \nThe WL solution is a full package build on top of the protocol. It consists of an android&iOS app, payment system, dashboards, and ofcourse all the benefits that come with the GET Protocol. It's a full package that allows the integrator to immediately start selling tickets.\n\nThe app is created in such a way that ticket buyers and sellers don't need to know a single thing about the blockchain or crypto to buy a ticket. So while the protocol works with the $GET token, ticket buyers just pay with fiat. On the other side of things are the dashboards where integrators can see a bunch of statistics, but also need to top up on $GET as fuel for their tickets. Any need for blockchain/crypto knowledge is removed here as well; Integrators top up with fiat and just see a bunch of fuel and how many tickets they can issue with that fuel.\n\nThere's multiple WL integrators, but the most well known is GUTS Tickets. Based in the Netherlands, but having issued events across the globe.\n\n**Digital Twin (DT)**  \nThe DT solution is a non-invasive product that can exist alongside a ticketeer's existing infrastructure. All it takes is a few lines of code to call the DT API, that's all. With it, a ticketeer can create a digital NFT copy of their own issued (paper) tickets. It's a way for existing ticketeers to dip their toes in the NFT world. There's more features coming to the DT when requested, but since it's relatively new this digital copy is the first start.\n\nSince it's relatively new there's a single DT active right now; YourTicketProvider. Based in the Netherlands, they sell about 2 million tickets yearly. Another one that's been announced to join EOY is eTicketaBlanca in Columbia.\n\n# Open Invitation for NFT events\n\nTo showcase the power of NFT tickets and show the world how powerfull the system is that GET Protocol has build, they've recently extended an open invitation to ticket NFT events from now til the end of Q2 for free. If you wish to host an NFT event after seeing how succesful NFT.NYC has been, be sure to contact them!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vzd0gn37jz71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b77c5778e1f28beccd2332ac819b162f05b0572\n\n# Summary\n\nTo summarise what we've iterated over:\n\n* The ticketing Industry encompasses event organisers, ticketeers, venues, fans/customers and regretfully ticket touts.\n* Ticket touts (scalpers) and big ticketeers like Ticketmaster weaponise the relation between you and the artist, extracting money out of the process without adding anything of value themselves.\n* GET Protocol has created a protocol that uses blockchain and other smart technologies to tackle the problems the Ticketing Industry face, as well as add new value to the ticketing usecase like NFT ticketing.\n* GET Protocol has created 2 products on top of the protocol to ease the onboarding of new and existing ticketeers.\n* To showcase the power of NFT ticketing, an open invitation ticket NFT events for free has been extended til the end of Q2 2022.\n* While this post has gone into the benefits GET Protocol offers to the ticketing usecase rather extensively, it hasn't touched upon the tokenomics side of things. If you wish to know more about that be sure to check out the faq in the comments, or just ask your questions below this post.\n* Comment holds some links.",

NFTs, in general, are well on their way to mass adoption. However, their perceived value remains disconnected from their practical value.\n\nNFTs describe unique cryptographic tokens which are considered valuable because of their security and scarcity. In combination with decentralized financial products, unique financial services can be created using these tokens. Potential use cases for this type of technological innovation include investments, liquidity mining, or in-game currencies. There are truly unlimited ideas for combining NFTs and DeFi-it remains to be seen, which interesting projects will appear soon.\n\nIt is clear that NFTs offer a high level of interoperability and act as representations of non-traditional assets. NFTs serve to represent some sort of value. The administration of these values can be done completely in the blockchain via smart contracts. This perfectly fits the definition of a DeFi project: a financial tool operating along with the blockchain.\n\nThis type of infrastructure will become increasingly important as we witness the rise of \u201cfinancial\u201d NFTs\n\nThere are DeFi projects that describe themselves as a decentralized exchange for NFTs.

Designed with the future of financial NFTs in mind, Drops aims to optimize the utility of NFT assets to minimize their opportunity cost and maximize the returns of holding them. \n\n[**Charged Particles**](https://charged.fi/) \\- It is a platform that enables users to combine ERC20 tokens with existing NFTs, to create \u201cbaskets\u201d of multiple tokens. This can include interest-generating tokens, creating some of the very first interest-earning NFT assets. \n\n[**NFTify**](https://nftify.network/) : It is a simple p2p marketplace for collaterized NFT loans. It allows borrowers to put up assets for a loan and lenders to make offers to lend in return for interest.\n\n[**Solv Protocol**](https://solv.finance/) \\- It[ ](https://solv.finance/)allows users to create \u201cVouchers\u201d - NFT assets that are financial instruments. These can represent unique investment allocations, bonds, deposit receipts, cover notes and more. Vouchers can be used to release the liquidity of lock-up assets, as well as control distribution in the form of transfer, trading and lending. \n\n [**Uniswap v3**](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/) \\- The third version of decentralized exchange, Uniswap, is issuing liquidity positions to its users in the form of NFTs.

According to Matthew Ball; managing partner of venture capital firm- Epyllion Industries, he said- \u2018\u2019Right now, we are on the cusp of the next internet\u2019\u2019\n\nThe metaverse would drastically & radically change everything we do. From how we work, interact in our day-day lives, shop & have social interactions. Zuckerberg himself has been bullish, believing it could replace the internet. And everyone including Facebook & Microsoft wants to own it, which isn\u2019t different from what\u2019s happening in the blockchain world.\n\nWith just few clicks, one could own a land in the metaverse through platforms like [Netvrk](https://www.netvrk.co/) as one can buy genesis Islands and establish a virtual presence (and you can hold, sell or rent your land) or even create a realm (virtual online marketplaces) on [Dreem](https://www.dreem.world/) using the realm builder toolkit even if you don\u2019t have any technical skill.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about being on the blockchain is the fact that these virtual items are yours & no one can take it away from you. Imagine if Fortnite shuts down its doors, you would lose your digital items. But that\u2019s not the case with the metaverse on the blockchain.\n\nIn [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/), you can design your own lands or create 3D assets and this stays on the blockchain forever as an NFT. Even better with [Dreem](https://www.dreem.world/), as it\u2019s decentralized, open & community governed. So, any realm being created is yours forever, can be minted into an NFT and completely monetized.\n\nThere are so much potentials & what can be achieved. I do think the scope is even wider than what anyone could think of at the moment.\n\nWhat are the other amazing opportunities the metaverse offers?  I\u2019m looking forward to know more.",

            "text": "**EXFelix - the absolute x100-x1000 hidden gem everybody missed - until now ! Still ultra early on this legit game changer ! Online poker, DeFi yield platform and innovative Decentralized EXchange.**  \n\n\nGuys, let me be honest with you : I'm not here to shill another Safe-Elon-Fair copypasta shitcoin, developped in 2hrs by a scammer.  \nThe token I'm talking about today is a legit several months old project with a real team behind and a HUGE opportunity for all of you. X100 is NOT exagerated : it's even a bit pessimist.\n\n**EXFelix is the reward token of the online poker and DeFi yield platforms EXTEND FINANCE and ETERNAL CASH.**  \n\n\nNever heard about them ? it's normal : they didn't started marketting yet. They planned to start it at the end of the month, after releasing **an absolut game changer : the FIRST Decentralized EXchange (DEX) with BUY and SELL LIMIT order on the Binance Smart Chain !** It will also be available on Eth 2.0 !  \n**Needless to say that such a innovation will be massively adopted by all of us, BSC users.**  \nThey are also selling NFT on Bakeryswap and creating their own NFT marketplace.  \nThis is the beggining of one of the most profilic ecosystem on the BSC, period.  \nNeedless to say all tokens have been audited and Liquidity Pools burnt.\n\n[https://www.extendfinance.ventures/](https://www.extendfinance.ventures/) just have a look at their website : it has nothing in common with the usual shitcoins we use to see on this channel.\n\nSo don't get me wrong : EXTEND FINANCE and ETERNAL CASH's tokens are great opportunity for the next months and years, but **the real masterpiece here is their reward token, EXFelix.**\n\nHere's why :\n\n1 - EXfelix is a deflationary token with a 5% tax where **2.5% of every transaction is instantly transfered to a jackpot wallet and 2.5% is burnt.** Those devs created the Safemoon-like tokenomics even before Safemoon was created !\n\n2 - that jackpot is won 3 times a day. One token means 1 ticket for every future jackpot. If the jackpot wallet goes over 1000$, it is split between several winners, **meaning dozens of holders can possibly won EACH DAY**. You just need to hold and the jackpot wallet is directly transfered to yours !\n\n3 - **there are only 84 000 tokens**. Nothing like the quadrillons supplies we use to see. Not only the deflationary tokenomics will see the token rise in price, but the odds to win the 1000$ jackpots are also huge !\n\n4 - **THERE IS ONLY 450 HOLDERS ATM. Y'all are still SUPER early.** Do you realize this is the numbers of holders any Safe-Fair scam token has after 1hr of shilling without any real use ? You will be one of the first holder of a futur big name of the BSC ecosystem.\n\n5 - **PRICE IS ONLY 7$ ATM**. This is a ridiculously small 600k$ marketcap. 10 million $ marketcap means 120$ each EXFelix, Safemoon current marketcap means 9800$. Not convinced ? **The reward token of one of EXFelix contender, Coctailbar.finance's PEANUTS, rise in price from 4 to 400$ in a few days, with a 33k supply. You missed PEANUTS - don't miss EXFelix !**\n\n6 - EXFelix is the reward token of ETERNAL CASH and EXTERNAL FINANCE platform, meaning it will have farming uses for poker players, NFT buyers, and liquidity providers : **each 100$ provided in the BUSD - EXF pair will make you earn you 10 EXFelix per week !** The ratio risk - reward is just astonishing. ETERNAL CASH and EXTERNAL FINANCE's tokens, EXF and EC, have more than 10k long time holders, once again it's not a random project built yesterday, it has already a serious customer and holder base.\n\n*As usual guys, DYOR.

            "text": "Getting into NFT is now much faster and easier than it was previously.\n\nAdoption is finally happening, as Twitter, Reddit, and even Discord have jumped on board. I believe the future holds customizable nft avatars, similar to what we see in Fortnite. We've all heard about how popular these customizable skins are. In 2022, non-fungible tokens are expected to be one of the most popular crypto trends. In 2021, many rare assets representing footballers and artwork were auctioned for hundreds of thousands of dollars, indicating that the market will continue to grow. Investing in NFT and new crypto is the best way to profit technically.\n\nNFTs and the metaverse have almost become synonyms. One of the reasons for this is the explosion of NFTs in blockchain gaming. Many people believe that virtual worlds will be used to manifest the metaverse, and interoperable games are a natural vehicle for this. The NFTs give people access to the metaverse in a variety of ways, including by linking their real-life identities to digital avatars.\nCustomizable nfts for personal use or amusement, rather than an ai-generated image, I believe, will be extremely popular. There are only a few projects like the NFT avatar maker tool, which is a \"\"all-in-one\"\" avatar tool. Users will be able to customise their Avatars by choosing from a growing library of assets that includes billions of combinations and over 1200 different assets like Samurai Masks, Superhero Cowls, and Golden Skin.",

(Cyber crime unit of the French Military Police and the accounting use-case was first, then we had 3 French municipalities voting through Tezos, then the Swiss city Wetzikon distributing COVID relief funds through Tezos, and now the Reno DAO.

            "text": "Gaming has come a long way since the late 1970s when arcades reigned supreme and home consoles were little more than a novelty. Back then, competitive gaming meant vying for the high score on space invaders at the local bowling alley or mall. The very idea of Twitch, an entire online video sharing platform dedicated to streaming games, would have sounded absolutely absurd. But things have certainly changed since then.\n\nThe past forty years have brought innumerable shifts to the game industry, with the graphical and power disparity between arcade and home console machines shrinking, then disappearing altogether. During the 2000s and 2010s, the advent of the smartphone and mobile games turned video games from a niche hobby targeted at children to one that every demographic enjoyed.\n\nToday, the e-sports industry is valued at over $1 billion with no signs of slowing down. The video game industry as a whole is larger than the film and US sports industries combined.\n\nBut the evolution of video games and competitive gaming isn\u2019t over. It\u2019s really just beginning. And the thing that will revolutionize it is Web3.\n\n \n\n# The Web 3.0 Revolution\n\nSo, what is Web3? Web3 is what happens when the internet meets recent technological advances like extended reality, IOT, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. It\u2019s a platform where users will be able to trade and use cryptocurrencies, purchase NFTs, and experience a version of the web that\u2019s uniquely tailored for them. In addition, it will simplify investing in DAOs and blockchain-based projects via sites like Starter.xyz.\n\nBut the important thing to note about Web3 when it comes to competitive gaming is that its technologies are the foundation for GameFi and play-to-earn (P2E) games.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cwiqf0sguke81.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81823310c15e4ed028291da3ade8431ca47d4822\n\n# The Rise of GameFi\n\nUntil the development of GameFi, competitive gaming and esports followed a similar trajectory to traditional sporting events. The best players rose to the top via online, local, and regional matches, eventually competing in major events offering big rewards. The only way to earn real money playing video games was by going pro. But few people ever got that chance.\n\nGameFi and the decentralization that undergirds it have upended that traditional model. Getting into the competitive gaming scene and earning cash rewards has become accessible for anyone in the world thanks to Web3 and play-to-earn gaming. And although it is still in it\u2019s infancy, millions of people around the world have already discovered its incredible potential.\n\nThis is the future of competitive gaming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# GameFi & Competitive Gaming\u2019s Growing Definition\n\nWhile traditional esports and competitive gaming won\u2019t disappear, the idea of competitive video games will expand to make room for P2E games. Axie Infinity\u2019s rise has proven that. Here\u2019s a P2E game that\u2019s recorded over $1.6 billion in total sales and averages nearly 2 million daily users. And it\u2019s shown no sign of slowing down.\n\nAxie Infinity\u2019s players stand at the vanguard of the P2E revolution, earning money while battling in-game enemies and each other. It\u2019s an entirely new way of understanding competitive gaming, and it\u2019s open to almost anyone. Even players without the funds to invest themselves can play many P2E games by joining a guild, a decentralized organization that makes playable NFTs and other in-game assets available for rent.\n\nBut Axie Infinity is only the first major success story in the growing GameFi market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5yl1qrohuke81.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d4b82e8eb772c2a3e555f835d5758a3679c492e\n\nNew projects are being developed every day, including games in every genre imaginable, from JRPGs to racing games. There are even a handful of monster breeding and battling startups that are gunning for Axie Infinity\u2019s first place position, including Starchi, a P2E game from the team behind Starter.xyz.\n\nA key difference between Starchi and Axie is that the price of one Starchi is much more affordable, allowing many more people to play (and earn). The goal at Starchi was to take away the barriers and limitations, and provide opportunity to a larger group of people overall.\n\nStarter.xyz\u2019s experience in the industry has uniquely equipped its team to develop a game that makes the most of GameFi\u2019s features and benefits. Starchi will be just one more example of how competitive gaming has changed since Web3 began taking shape.\n\nOnly time will tell what further evolutions await the gaming industry as technology continues its quick march toward decentralization and personalization.",

            "text": "Did You Know: Experts estimate artists only receive 14% of the total profit from the music industry!\n\nWhilst NFT technology has been empowering visual artists to sell their work freely, musicians have been left behind to will of the major record labels and streaming companies. Many low-mid level musicians are unable to enter a market dominated by big players, who themselves are losing much of their profit to these corporations. Furthermore, fans have found it increasingly difficult to interact with their favourite artists, as marketing and media companies have continued to exercise greater control on the industry.\n\nHow Do NFT's Solve this Problem?\n\nAhead of the curve in many ways, loud market NFT platform launches this week.\nBy allowing the direct sale of music and audio files by artists to fans, Loud Market cuts out much of the unnecessary costs of the established music industry! When using the native $LOUD token artists may sell their work directly to their fans for no additional fees!* With fee-less sales artists can easily monetise their work and interact directly with fans, furthermore, fans will be able to support their favourite artists and own their favourite tracks! This said, Loud Market is not just for low-mid level artists. Mainstream artists will also benefit from an immediate stream of income, being able to sell their work instantly rather than waiting for streaming income and disk sales. The potential market size for Loud Market and the $LOUD token is endless, as there is no artist that would not benefit from NFT technology.\n\nMarket Statistics\n\nNFT trading has increased drastically each month of 2021 with August\u2019s trading volume sitting over $3.2 billion.\n\nHow do you think NFT tech will change the industry?",

No, because it's a marketplace aka you are posting your music between the others countless artists doing the exact same thing.\n\nTLDR:\n\n\\- One of (if not the most) oversaturated market\n\n\\-> Tools making only easier to make music.\n\n\\-> Only chance to be famous with labels since artists not enough funds to launch career\n\n\\-> Famous people negotiate contract equivalent to raise in jobs or create own labels while having private team (Personal touring & marketing team).\n\n\\-> Other options dead since long time ago (Ex: Found on Social Media)\n\n\\- NFT let you directly sell to fans, but what fans?\n\n\\-> NFT don't promote you nor make you famous\n\n\\-> Selling in marketplace between countless others artists again oversaturated.\n\n**-> You have to spend money for promotion to make money (Aka be supported by labels if you don't have funds)**\n\n\\--> NFT don't solve the problem. I'm not against NFTs, it can help earn extra money by selling goods & exclusive stuff, but this is nowhere near what OP claims music sells as NFT can achieve.\n\nNote: OP only uses August NFT data top of the bubble, every others months between July & November are around 30% of August.",

Raiblocks transactions could only send the native assets (no data or notes). It was centralized and the security of the chain was questioned. By the time Raiblocks rebranded to **NANO** in February 2018, the hype was dead and it began the long slide into irrelevancy, leaving many bagholders.\n\nNow imagine that same hype channeled at an actual worthy project.\n\n**Enter Loopring** \n\n* Secured by the decentralized and secure Ethereum blockchain\n\n* Enables scalability for Ethereum by reducing fees and transaction time\n\n* Shilled by Vitalik\n\n* Speculatively about to partner in one of the biggest NFT deals in history\n\n* Vested interest and hype driven by GME apes, superstonk shill & crypto autists united.\n\n[GME NFT due dilligence](https://np.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oy9ilv/gme_and_the_nft_that_could_rock_the_boat/)\n\n[Loopring source code GME breadcrumbs](https://gmedd.com/blockchain/loopring-code-confirms-gamestop-nft-marketplace-is-underway/)\n\n[Looping GME basically confirmed](https://gmedd.com/dd/clues-point-towards-gamestop-launching-nft-marketplace-with-leading-crypto-technology-company-loopring/)\n\n[Head of GME blockchain twitter](https://twitter.com/finestonematt) Wonder where he used to work \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\n\n[List of exchanges where you can buy Loopring](https://wcibtc.com/loopring)\n\nPrice discovery hasn't even started yet.

            "text": "2021 has given us the explosion of DeFi. Decentralised exchanges have seen their volumes grow to sizes that compare to their centralised counterparts.\n\nDeFi growth through 2021:\n\nNFT\u2019s have had a similar surge this year, with use cases varying from trading meme\u2019s to verifying tickets for real world events.\n\nBoth of these sectors have seen absolutely explosive gains in terms of market cap, and this begs the question: What is going to be the next boom in crypto?\n\nBy 2030, most securities will be tokenized. In an interview with Raiffeisen Bank, Raiffeisen explains that the way we currently trade securities will be gone within 10 years. Even though Raiffeisen reports that the majority of investors are not currently asking for exposure to security tokens, investors are beginning to demand a trading experience for stocks that is similar to cryptocurrencies. They want transparency, liquidity, and instant settlement. Transitioning to trading all assets on distributed ledger technology is inevitable\n\nOne of the main trends in the security token market is tokenized real estate, which became the highest growth segment in 2020. It more than doubled its number of offerings compared to 2019. This growth has not stopped in 2021, and seems that we are on the verge of Asset tokenization becoming mainstream.\n\nAnother large trend which is only now starting to be explored is the tokenising of SME companies. Blockchain companies are working with [Business incubators to tokenise shares in SME companies.](https://smartlands.io/blog/smes-are-looking-forward-to-tokenizing-their-shares/)\n\n[Countries like Ukraine are already passing laws to get ahead of this tokenization boom](https://www.coindesk.com/ukraine-presents-road-map-for-developing-the-digital-assets-industry)\nIt seems to me that the tokenization of real world assets, allowing to tap into the locked liquidity of assets like Real estate and company shares, is going to be the next boom in the cryptosphere. There are companies out there who are currently making waves like these [4 buildings that were tokenized with a 33% revenue share to those who held tokens on the platform](https://news.bitcoin.com/smartlands-platform-launch-tokenizing-the-real-economy-in-europe-with-a-first-mover-advantage/)\nLet me know your thoughts on tokenising assets below, and if there are any tokenisation projects you have your eyes on.",

I mean people are driven by the hype on memecoin and NFTs, and they forget about how they can benefit from cryptocurrencies that carry actual utility. Definitely this is not a general idea, but it\u2019s what I\u2019m seeing recently.\n\nMeanwhile, DeFi has been rising in the past couple of years, but obviously it\u2019s yet to reach its full potential, and I don\u2019t think we need to discuss this point. I don\u2019t think DeFi gets the marketing it deserves, I mean recently RedBull racing made a deal with Bybit, and it\u2019s earning 50% of this deal in crypto, BitDAO\u2019s native token. But that, because it\u2019s not a meme token, you won\u2019t be hearing about it.\n\nI mean people went crazy on Dogecoin just because Tesla allowed individuals to pay for their car accessories with crypto, literally the entire internet was full of this news and how it\u2019s a massive step towards \u2018mass adoption\u2019.\n\nIf you ask me, having Bybit and Redbull racing agreed on such news is one of the best ways to prove that crypto is more than just digital assets, and it also shows that DeFi governance tokens are worth much more than how people value them.",

CryptoPunks (the original), Hashmasks, Bored Ape Kennel Club, and Avastars are among the most popular NFT avatar collections.\n\nThese are well-known projects that will be popular in the metaverse. However, I believe that having a nft profile picture will become fashionable. The trend has only recently begun, and Twitter, Discord, and Reddit have all jumped on board.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow and Reese Witherspoon have both changed their Twitter profile pictures to NFT avatars, implying that adoption will speed up as more celebrities join the movement. I believe that NFT avatars will become popular in the near future.\n\nCustom tools excite me right now, such as the \"\"NFt avatar maker\"\", which allows me to create a custom NFt avatar with a variety of customization options.",
