Didn't have access to traditional banks.\n\nBasically, just someone who wants to use a technology that allows for a p2p payment in almost any situation, but didn't really have a need or interest in the features provided by decentralization?\n\nAlso, for the average user, how would you convince them that decentralization was worth the extra effort required to get into BTC? For example, I can just go and buy USA backed CBDCs and store them in a digital wallet from El Salvador. Why BTC then?",

This helps maintain a healthy and stable token price that benefits traders, investors, and liquidity providers.\r  \n\r  \nGemkeeper is a community-focused Automated Market Maker (AMM) and DeFi platform built on Oasis\u2019 Emerald Paratime. It allows users to execute token swaps, enter existing and create new liquidity pools.

And that is because a network like Oasis has so broad use cases and interests. \n\nIt would be useful to look at our roadmap to find our current interests, but let me just quickly mention a couple of things that we are currently working on. NFT and GameFi economies are very interesting to us, and we are working on integrating the building blocks and primitives that allow us to bootstrap those into our network. One company from our Metaminds x Accelerator program (another partner :D ), Rosart, already released their NFT Launchpad, and are launching their marketplace. Rosart is also becoming a partner to our other programs so that they can support other projects in our ecosystem, like the foundation has supported them. This way we facilitate success in all ways and cross generationally. \n\nAnother focuses of ours are DeFi and Confidentiality. Those are whole different stories, but with very similar dynamics as with Rosart. Ultimately, building success for a L1 revolves around partnerships as long term win-win situations are what it takes to be successful in this space.",

Who possesses the keys is where the fun part starts to happen. You can \u201clend\u201d (rent) this token via smart contract with conditions, such as how much gas you\u2019ll allow being spent for how much time they\u2019re allowed to view the data (even select data for data queries without exposing the rest), it is then returned to you! This is of course a very high-level overview for the sake of simplicity but that\u2019s one way you can stake data and earn from it. \r  \n \r  \nOasis is a great network for building applications that allow users to retain ownership of their tokenized data, and to monetize it. Some great areas for this are things like browser cookie data and ultimately even banking and transactions data. \r  \n \r  \nWe have a number of companies already developing such solutions on Parcel API and many upcoming in Cipher paratime. For example, Nebula genomics stores the DNA sequence data from their user\u2019s saliva swaps, mints a token that gives access to the owner. Using the data token the user can then monetize their data.",

Thanks for asking it :)  \n\n\nThe mainstream has a lot of use cases that can benefit from transposing existing web2 and offline process to a smart contract / decentralized system. Most of these currently, however, suffer from the public nature of all data stored on chain. If you just imagine, how many things would you store online if all of the information was publicly available. Things like all of your emails, your bank account transactions and location data can be stored on the blockchain but currently only in a public format where everyone has access to the same data.  \n\n\nNow this is obviously a sub optimal method of doing things, and this is what Oasis is here to solve. Our technology allows us to store all this information using blockchain but to keep it private simultaneously. That is what we believe will be the catalyst for mainstream adaptation. Timing wise we are actually really close now for that to happen, so I\u2019m expecting first mainstream applications using confidential data to roll out in 2022. And that\u2019s super exciting!",

The x amount of BTC you can get for your BNB is now worth less in USD then before the BTC move down.

The x amount of BTC you can get for your BNB is now worth less in USD then before the BTC move down.

                    "response": "I think the announcement today indicating that Russia may accept payment for oil in BTC was a significant factor in the jump in price. Also increasing clarity with regard to regulatory environment is also a net positive for BTC and other digital assets. But this is all being counter-balanced by the ongoing uncertainty with the war in Ukraine, and the massive disruption to the world economy (that has yet to be felt except at the gas pump). Michael Saylor and other BTC maxis call BTC a \"risk-off\" asset, but I think the investing community at large sees crypto as a very volatile, hence risky, asset. BTC may well prove to be a nice risk-off asset over time. Right now though, people aren't flying to crypto to preserve wealth. If they did, we'd be seeing new highs throughout this whole Ukraine ordeal, rather than the range we are currently in. Having said all that, the strength in the past few days is encouraging. Its a good sign that maybe BTC is indeed slowly shedding its image as a risky, twitchy asset. \n\nI would expect the sentiment for ETH to be fairly strong for the next few months as we see more and more news about how well the testing of Kiln testnet is going, and we get some more clarity on the shift to PoS. This is going to be a good tailwind for ETH in the short (3 months) term. Beyond that, it depends on how well the shift goes.\n\nFor BTC, I'm longterm bullish, but I'm expecting to be rangebound for a while. I don't see a catalyst for any strong upswing until maybe the next halving. To say this another way, I hope to be accumulating for these next two years while the price is still reasonably affordable.",

MATIC is also a great altcoin and one i owned for awhile. I let go of a large portion when it hit 2.80s and have since reallocated some of the profits into RBIF. It pays reflections, its super cheap, the dev team is great with the whitepaper and over delivering on promises made to the community. We\u2019re also preparing for 1% of RBIF to be burned once we hit 3000 holders. Which at the moment is sitting at about 31 left. I would check it out and see how you like it, there is a ROBOINU website to visit and to look at the details for yourself.",

When their RoboWallet releases this year it will revolutionize the fintech industry with its seamless and secure crossborder transfers of crypto to cash.
