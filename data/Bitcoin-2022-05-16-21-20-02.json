Inflation of a dollar from 2000 until today is over 70% but wages nationally at the bottom 20th percentile is only up 5%- and that's not inflation adjusted, that's gross dollars. The total share of money supply in the hands of the bottom 80% of America (yes the bottom 80%) is less than a third of the top 20%- which incidentally has grown guess how much- 180%. Think that's a coincidence? That the people moving 75% of the money supply have grown 180% while the dollar grew 170% and everyone else's cut stayed the same in gross (and therefore went down in aggregate)? \"It's a big club- and you ain't in it\" - cynical comedy man.\n\nBitcoin was created specifically because of the problem they ineloquently and tangentially ramble about. They might miss the mark but they're kinda looking at the target- wealth generation in this country is a debt machine powered by access to a trillion dollar printing press you'll never see a dime from. Money is minted off debt, wealth is minted off debt. Debt is tax free and spends the same as your hard earned dollar (which these days is $0.90 if you save it for a year). Boss makes a dollar, you lose a dime. Your grandparents minimum wage of $0.25 an hour was 2 gold eagles a month. Wanna guess what that is today? 'bout $40 grand. How can you blame them for being pissed off that they're taking home 1/3 what the dumbest laziest asshole did in 1933 for the same 40 hours a week? I mean, were talking a minimum wage of $20/hr if we had sound money that wasn't leveraged to the tits by suits who _knowingly_ tank the economy, hoard wealth, get the government to print them out of debt, and rinse/repeat while you can't buy fucking baby formula and the government sends $200 billion a year overseas just because it can? Every dollar printed hurts them just as bad.\n\nWe're all mad at the same thing. Our forefathers struggled and died so we'd have better lives and our lives are _objectively worse_. Our jobs don't pay shit, our healthcare system is a joke not just in pricing but in actual outcomes, we can't afford houses, we can't afford kids, we increasingly can't even save or invest our way out because inflation and boom/bust cycles implode any gains we make, and it's all getting worse because the whole system is rigged _and we can all see it clear as day_. The whole situation is politicized for a reason. The longer everyone blames the antiwork crowd or the Bitcoin crowd or the frog meme crowd or the colored hair crowd or whoever, the longer the actual fucking menace to society can make the printers go brrrrr.",

Most actually express that they want to work and fulfill themselves but cannot because they are being exploited and/or short changed, or straight up mistreated in the workplace.\n\nThey do not simply ask for a cut from the higher ups. They are simply pointing out that wages have not grown with the rate of productivity and growth in this country, but CEO take home pay has never been higher. You cannot deny that this concentration is unhealthy, even more so in this inflationary environment when their measly wages are being eroded more and more. The CEOs certainly provide value, but do CEOs deserve 200-300x the wages of average workers? Especially those that cash out after tanking their businesses? (Look up JCPenney\u2019s CEO bonus after horrible performance) Do baseline workers deserve not to eat, or meet basic needs? That\u2019s the road you\u2019re going down when you have takes like yours..Your statements seem to neglect that workers are the backbone of this country and that laborers & unions give us many of the benefits we enjoy today in the workplace.\n\nI don\u2019t think someone flipping burgers should make as much as an engineer, but I don\u2019t blame them for being upset by any means.

But yes blame ONLY democrats and the younger generation for the inflationary environment we live in. Some democratic policies didn\u2019t help, but to say democrats and the youngins are the sole reason shows you truly know nothing about economics, politics, and the world in general. My degree is quite literally in political science & business\n\nSounds like you\u2019re a biased red pill-er, who lives in a dichotomy bubble. I find that most Americans think this way, pretty sad. It\u2019s pretty easy to tell who\u2019s \u201cmush brain\u201d here. Your bias has mushed your brain so far to the right you can\u2019t even see what\u2019s happening around you. If democrats are the problem, then why didn\u2019t build back better pass? Because a democrat voted against it. \n\nEDIT: I also believe it was sir 45 that told Jerome Powell to keep the money printer going in the previous taper tantrum, because the market couldn\u2019t handle raising rates AT ALL, despite us undergoing one of the largest economic expansions to date. So thank your orange leader for that one too, he directly pressured the federal reserve to keep printing more money & stimulating the economy",

You're the one who doesn't understand how a deflationary currency is an atrocious idea. There's a reason why literally every single country on the planet strives for a small positive (and controlled) inflation. You don't want to encourage conservation because that stagnates your entire economy, you **want** it not to be worth it to just store currency. What you actually want to encourage in order to have economic growth is for money to circulate in the form of either consumption or investment, and a small amount of inflation accomplishes that.\n\nYou literally do not comprehend what you're wishing for. If your country's currency were replaced with a deflationary one, you would very quickly enter a severe recession and you'd economically crumble shortly after.",

As a result those of us who do work pay extremely high taxes. Eventually if the WEF gets its way we will all have nothing. Only those at the very top of course will own everything but they don't mention that even in the fine print. They will accomplish this with taxes they are already making it so expensive that people who own their own homes increasingly have to sell because they can't afford the rent they have to pay to the government for something they already own. At that point why should I work? I'll just lay around and collect a free check like everyone else. The only problem is in such a world what can we buy with our free checks, when nobody's making anything? Of course, commies like Trudeau and Biden cannot comprehend such concepts. So the world's going to have to go to complete shit before the woke liberal sheep really wake up and we start to get real conservative governments back in power. Or who knows maybe they will never wake up. Maybe it's back to the caveman lifestyle, I've heard the paleo diet is quite healthy.",

That's fine. Bitcoin is sound money but it doesn't need an economic theory. It just is plain and simply sound money. You and I both know and love it for that. I'm not here to dis anyone for liking Bitcoin. \n\nI read r/antiwork frequently. Much like here there is a broad range of ideas. Crackpot to brilliant. Categorically dismissing them as lazy people who don't want to work is disingenuous and shows personal biases more than passing a qualitative judgement.\n\nHumans are born valid. They don't have to toil away at shitty jobs to earn validity. Too frequently I see hard working well meaning folks denigrate people who aren't as talented, fortunate or lucky as themselves. People should be more aware of their own situation and how fortunate and lucky they might be. We fool ourselves into believing that everything we have we 100% earned. That's just categorically false. We're all fighting our own battles. Being compassionate to others and their struggle just takes a little effort. That's my point.\n\nEnjoy the dip. DCA.

First Bitcoin is not deflationary as many people say. Bitcoin is just non-deflationary. Except for lost bitcoins that are estimated to approx. 10-15% of total supply, no Bitcoin is \u00ab\u00a0burned\u00a0\u00bb. There will always be 21m Bitcoin after all are minted. You can not decrease the supply, thus it is non deflationary it\u2019s just scarce.\n\nThat anti work crowd maybe isn\u2019t tech savvy and you can\u2019t totally blame them. When you\u2019re working your ass off just to pay the bills you probably won\u2019t prioritize to educate yourself on some new tech investment stuff: you\u2019ll still invest into assets the people that eat you offer you.
