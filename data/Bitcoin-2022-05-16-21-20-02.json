Inflation of a dollar from 2000 until today is over 70% but wages nationally at the bottom 20th percentile is only up 5%- and that's not inflation adjusted, that's gross dollars. The total share of money supply in the hands of the bottom 80% of America (yes the bottom 80%) is less than a third of the top 20%- which incidentally has grown guess how much- 180%. Think that's a coincidence? That the people moving 75% of the money supply have grown 180% while the dollar grew 170% and everyone else's cut stayed the same in gross (and therefore went down in aggregate)? \"It's a big club- and you ain't in it\" - cynical comedy man.\n\nBitcoin was created specifically because of the problem they ineloquently and tangentially ramble about. They might miss the mark but they're kinda looking at the target- wealth generation in this country is a debt machine powered by access to a trillion dollar printing press you'll never see a dime from. Money is minted off debt, wealth is minted off debt. Debt is tax free and spends the same as your hard earned dollar (which these days is $0.90 if you save it for a year). Boss makes a dollar, you lose a dime. Your grandparents minimum wage of $0.25 an hour was 2 gold eagles a month. Wanna guess what that is today? 'bout $40 grand. How can you blame them for being pissed off that they're taking home 1/3 what the dumbest laziest asshole did in 1933 for the same 40 hours a week? I mean, were talking a minimum wage of $20/hr if we had sound money that wasn't leveraged to the tits by suits who _knowingly_ tank the economy, hoard wealth, get the government to print them out of debt, and rinse/repeat while you can't buy fucking baby formula and the government sends $200 billion a year overseas just because it can? Every dollar printed hurts them just as bad.\n\nWe're all mad at the same thing. Our forefathers struggled and died so we'd have better lives and our lives are _objectively worse_. Our jobs don't pay shit, our healthcare system is a joke not just in pricing but in actual outcomes, we can't afford houses, we can't afford kids, we increasingly can't even save or invest our way out because inflation and boom/bust cycles implode any gains we make, and it's all getting worse because the whole system is rigged _and we can all see it clear as day_. The whole situation is politicized for a reason. The longer everyone blames the antiwork crowd or the Bitcoin crowd or the frog meme crowd or the colored hair crowd or whoever, the longer the actual fucking menace to society can make the printers go brrrrr.",

Wages rising, especially very quickly over levels of productivity, definitely can and will contribute to inflation. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price/wage_spiral\n\nMinimum wage has been raised many times in the past without large price changes (especially at different state/local levels) but what we\u2019re seeing today is not just a small adjustments to minimum wages, we\u2019re seeing some retail employees get 2, 3, 4x what they used to. \n\nWhether anyone thinks it\u2019s deserved or not given many of these jobs have not kept up with inflation in the past, the current spike is \u201cunsustainable\u201d\u2026 that\u2019s the word choice of the Fed, Bank of England, etc and they\u2019ve been exceedingly dovish thus far. The wage-price spiral already is happening - it\u2019s abundantly clear in the low end of the rental market (a huge part of the CPI) where wage compression has pushed even more people into an already constrained market.

Don't be silly.\n\nSo you are saying the owners of ExxonMobil and shell are part of the government?  Hmm that's news to me. They influence government by turning economic power into political power just like Marx predicted and wrote about. Same with agriculture products, healthcare, housing. These are owned by capitalists not the state. I'm glad you are showing your lack of knowledge for everyone to see.

That was not the case in like 50-80\u2019 when people did almost any job and had a better lifestyle comparatively to people earning minimum wage today.\n\nConcerning the \u00ab\u00a0seeing inflation issue and not seeing a point in getting a deflationary asset\u00a0\u00bb it\u2019s something else. First Bitcoin is not deflationary as many people say. Bitcoin is just non-deflationary. Except for lost bitcoins that are estimated to approx. 10-15% of total supply, no Bitcoin is \u00ab\u00a0burned\u00a0\u00bb. There will always be 21m Bitcoin after all are minted. You can not decrease the supply, thus it is non deflationary it\u2019s just scarce.\n\nThat anti work crowd maybe isn\u2019t tech savvy and you can\u2019t totally blame them. When you\u2019re working your ass off just to pay the bills you probably won\u2019t prioritize to educate yourself on some new tech investment stuff: you\u2019ll still invest into assets the people that eat you offer you.

The more people do this, the less influential central banks become, and the less power they have over everyone's lives. This cancer is systemic and we can't cure it overnight. But we can stop exacerbating it today by opting out of the broken fiat system.\n\n\"Fifty sats\" is currently worth about 1 or 2 cents. I know you're being melodramatic, but I Promise you that the antiwork crowd can absolutely afford more than 1-2 cents per week. It will take them a lot of work to cast off their defeatist victimhood attitudes, and most of them will never succeed.

But because they don't like Biden somehow they can't work together towards a common good.  This kind of teaming up and refusing to work together with other teams. Or viewing everything through the binary lens of western politics. It not only suspends actual progress it creates a situation where we are fighting each other as the ruling class steals from our pockets then points the finger at the other team. It's almost tragic seeing how this plays out on Reddit all the time. You can literally see how the posts that glinly demonize another group get upvoted and the ones trying to have nuanced discussion about forming a real movement most people can get behind just whither away . It's really sad what happened here. The mob mentalities have for some reason become the standard.\nI remember back in the day you would read a few different opinions on a subject at the top of posts here and feel educated in a way. Now you just get vicious echo chambers filled with mostly lame condescending remarks that only work in this one liner culture we are curating.",

You cannot deny that this concentration is unhealthy, even more so in this inflationary environment when their measly wages are being eroded more and more. The CEOs certainly provide value, but do CEOs deserve 200-300x the wages of average workers? Especially those that cash out after tanking their businesses?

Global economy has leveled out a lot more than that time. And America has decided that collective labor is too much like communism/socialism and that simply isn\u2019t allowed. \n\nSo, less of a peak to sit on, and less leverage in the marketplace with the death of unions led to workers getting lubed up and bent over. Not so much the money printing, but that is a part of it. \n\nThe root problem isn\u2019t that the imaginary money keeps getting made. It\u2019s that the actual tangible resources are being hoarded by those who will never be able to utilize those resources. We don\u2019t need USD or Bitcoin to drag out the guillotines, but the hoarders *do* need USD and Bitcoin to keep stringing us along in the hopes that we don\u2019t bring out the knives. \n\nOr they could simply share a *little* bit of the wealth they\u2019ve collected.

You're the one who doesn't understand how a deflationary currency is an atrocious idea. There's a reason why literally every single country on the planet strives for a small positive (and controlled) inflation. You don't want to encourage conservation because that stagnates your entire economy, you **want** it not to be worth it to just store currency. What you actually want to encourage in order to have economic growth is for money to circulate in the form of either consumption or investment, and a small amount of inflation accomplishes that.\n\nYou literally do not comprehend what you're wishing for. If your country's currency were replaced with a deflationary one, you would very quickly enter a severe recession and you'd economically crumble shortly after.",

As a result those of us who do work pay extremely high taxes. Eventually if the WEF gets its way we will all have nothing. Only those at the very top of course will own everything but they don't mention that even in the fine print. They will accomplish this with taxes they are already making it so expensive that people who own their own homes increasingly have to sell because they can't afford the rent they have to pay to the government for something they already own. At that point why should I work? I'll just lay around and collect a free check like everyone else. The only problem is in such a world what can we buy with our free checks, when nobody's making anything? Of course, commies like Trudeau and Biden cannot comprehend such concepts. So the world's going to have to go to complete shit before the woke liberal sheep really wake up and we start to get real conservative governments back in power. Or who knows maybe they will never wake up. Maybe it's back to the caveman lifestyle, I've heard the paleo diet is quite healthy.",

You have your \"fiat is inevitable\" free banking types, lost in a pipe dream.

Which austrians did that? \n\n\nIf you are thinking of Schiff, he is famously trying to push gold, and is only austrian in a \"my father was one\" sense, so we can set him aside as being a disingenuous marketeer.

There were several economic crises prior to 1913, during the gold standard. It's not like things were great before the Fed was established. \n\nMost economic historians will tell you that the gold standard is a very poor idea. It prevents the necessary flexibility that comes with a fiat system. Changing the money supply works as an important \"valve\" without which all adjustments in the economy must happen through changes in prices and wages (which is far more painful). \n\nHowever, that does not mean that a Fiat system is not without its own deep problems; and I deeply believe that Bitcoin is the best investment. I just dont think the monetary system (whether fiat or fixed supply) is the key decisive thing to bring economic success.",
