More info on the domain here: https://whois.domaintools.com/auxuglobal.com\n\nIt's hosted on the same machine as at least two other scam sites with the exact same layout (robitplus and mcexpro .com), more info here: https://reverseip.domaintools.com/search/?q=auxuglobal.com\n\nThose sites are 80ish and 20ish days old, so I assume they just keep rotating sites as the old ones are taken down. Because of this, eventually the current URL will be closed down and they will just start scamming people with a new URL, so your warnings will not really help anyone in the future.",
