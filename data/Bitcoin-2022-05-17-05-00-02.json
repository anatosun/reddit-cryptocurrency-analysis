I\u2019m capable of learning but literally wouldn\u2019t even know where to go to download Bitcoin core. What\u2019s the best node hardware for someone like me and what are the steps to set it up? Once it\u2019s up and running, can I direct my trezor wallet to it or should I switch to a node based wallet. Sorry if this sounds rookie, just trying to learn.",

You can also have a lightning node with it if you want. It was my first time setting it up and I was able to figure it out. You can access it via tor when you're not near it which is cool.",
