This program offers very generous access to GitLab's Ultimate tier for accepted OSS projects. So I would encourage other projects to check them out!\n\nFor those who don't know, our project's main repository is here:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node\n\nor you can find us via\n\nhttps://bitcoincashnode.org",

Netmasks that are invalid per RFC 4632 are no longer accepted\n\n2. The -whitelistrelay default has been restored to enabled\n\n3. MacOSX users need at least OSX 10.14 (Mojave)\n\nUsers who are running any of our previous releases are recommended to upgrade to v24.1.0, except for Mac OSX users who are not able to run 10.14 or later - we ask those to remain on v24.0.0 until they are able to upgrade to Mojave.\n\nFor the full release notes, please visit:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/releases/tag/v24.1.0\n\nExecutables and source code for supported platforms are available at the\nabove link, or via the download page on our project website at \n\nhttps://bitcoincashnode.org\n\nWe hope you enjoy our latest release and invite you to join us to improve Bitcoin Cash.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe [Bitcoin Cash Node team](https://bitcoincashnode.org/en/team).\n\n---\n\nParticular thanks from me to the other maintainers and our project dev contributors who have put in a lot of effort in the months leading up this release.\n\nThanks Calin, imaginary_username, emergent_reasons, Axel Gembe, Dagur, sickpig, matricz, SlowRiot, Andrew#128, Josh Wong, Corentin, Tracy, Fernando Pelliccioni, Josh Ellithorpe, Josh Green (our point of contact with Verde for the testing collaboration), the translators at Satoshi's Angels, our regular discussion partners and business users with whom we interact at times, and the many contributors from other projects whose backports we include in our software.\n\nI would like to invite anybody who wants to participate with BCHN, to join our Slack or Telegram and get to know us. We are an open project, we have lots of (exciting, we think!) work for interested developers or testers, and we are open to various forms of collaboration.\n\nWe're in the process of setting up a more formal description of our [bounty process](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/1327) - comments welcome.",
