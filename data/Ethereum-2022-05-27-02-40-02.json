He started getting a bunch of \u201cserved eth_sendTransaction\u201d messages in terminal that were accompanied by \u201cerr=unknown account.\u201d\n\nHe shut down the node and we are both fairly confident that someone calling remotely into his node wouldn\u2019t have the ability to breach his computer or network more deeply. Is there reason for concern? \n\nThanks!!",
