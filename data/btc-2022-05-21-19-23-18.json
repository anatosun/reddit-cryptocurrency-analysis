Tether is a big issue in the space, anyone can see that, and I'm sure without it BCH would for much better.\n\nBut would rather it leaving the market with a soft landing than a crypto apocalyptic winter that spooks people for the next 10-15 years.\n\nInteresting read, thanks for the share user4morethan2mins!",

Most stable coins (nearly all) will fail as no one would trust them.\n\nTether being destroyed will only destroy value in the short run. That is my take on it.\n\nThe idea that people would sell Tether to buy crypto, pushing up crypto prices seems absurd to me. It would be like suggesting that UST collapsing was great on crypto prices for the same reason. It wasn't. Neither will Tethers collapse for identical reasons.\n\nHow much of Tether's 'collateral' is crypto? Their collapse will not only send huge ripples of fear in the market, it will flood the market with cheap BTC and any other collateral they have.",

BCH is better than ETH and BTC combined for all sorts of things, but it will never have the same currency qualities as Monero. That's why it also suffered (lke ETH and BTC).\n\nBTC is a cryptoasset that is easily sold off. Everything else is basically a casino, so you do it for the fun and expect to lose it all anyways.",
