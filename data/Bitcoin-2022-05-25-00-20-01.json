This is not as cost efficient as RBF because a second transaction has to be created with an extra high fee to pay for the original one, whereas RBF actually cancels the original one.  However, sometimes you would rather secure the payment immediately as the receiver even if it means you pay the extra fee yourself.\n> \n> **Boost fee as sender: Replace By Fee (RBF)**\n> \n> RBF allows a sender to cancel an unconfirmed transaction that pays a lower fee by broadcasting a new one using the same UTXO that pays a higher fee.  This is the reason you do not want to complete your end of an exchange with an untrustworthy party until their transaction reaches 1+ confirmation because they might pay a higher fee on an unconfirmed transaction that spends the coins back to their own wallet instead of your address!\n\nIn your case, you're sending it, so you can do a RBF. I think Electrum now has a \"Cancel\" button in the GUI that does basically a RBF.",
