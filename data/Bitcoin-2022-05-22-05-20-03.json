What makes it hard is DCAing for years and not seeing returns, then questionning if you made the right move. \n\nThat is exactly what happened to me in 2017. You then learn the true worth of Bitcoin, but also the risk of it. I sold between 45-55k on this run up, and recently started buying back at 30k, and expect it to go under 20k before next halving. \n\nThis drop is far less scary than the other bear market.",

That means you have 2 more years in the $20K to $30K range until the next halvening event to accumulate satoshis and bitcoin will be the first asset class to recover during that depression.\n\nBest case scenario;  \nIf we're lucky, the FED and ECB will lower their rates in the summer to prevent the world economy from crashing and gas/energy supply chain has reached its height at this point and will lower in the coming months with or without a war going on. This would give us a short and final bullrun from september till december ish but it would just delay the inevitable economic crash but is all we would need if we can sell near the top.

Maybe i should not compare today to 2017-18? But i believe Btc could go sideways and drop at least 70% from its previous ath. My 2 cents, Btc could hit $12-$15k at the lowest point.
