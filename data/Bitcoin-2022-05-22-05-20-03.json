What makes it hard is DCAing for years and not seeing returns, then questionning if you made the right move. \n\nThat is exactly what happened to me in 2017. You then learn the true worth of Bitcoin, but also the risk of it. I sold between 45-55k on this run up, and recently started buying back at 30k, and expect it to go under 20k before next halving. \n\nThis drop is far less scary than the other bear market.",

That means you have 2 more years in the $20K to $30K range until the next halvening event to accumulate satoshis and bitcoin will be the first asset class to recover during that depression.\n\nBest case scenario;  \nIf we're lucky, the FED and ECB will lower their rates in the summer to prevent the world economy from crashing and gas/energy supply chain has reached its height at this point and will lower in the coming months with or without a war going on. This would give us a short and final bullrun from september till december ish but it would just delay the inevitable economic crash but is all we would need if we can sell near the top.

Maybe i should not compare today to 2017-18? But i believe Btc could go sideways and drop at least 70% from its previous ath. My 2 cents, Btc could hit $12-$15k at the lowest point.

Reality is just like you said, we will not go back to ATH before the stock market does, the crypto market is still too small to be decoupled from it.\n\nI still strongly believe we will go back to ATH, but not before inflation/interest get sorted out, which is the main market fear at the moment.",

There have been some exciting developments lately with this el Salvador conference, Gary ginslers meeting with the SEC, and the discovery that even China can't effectively stop mining.  Ultimately though, I think these are small fry developments, big news to us, irrelevant to the 97+% of people who are scrounging some cash together for booze and strippers.  Big news will be large banks using it as a tradable reserve asset to bypass ACH, Normie's will be using bitcoin even if they don't realize it",

Failure to declare it would be tax fraud (and who wants to do that for a nominal sum). Since you received it off exchange you have a little more leg work to do, but essentially every time you received sats you received income, determined based on the then current price of Bitcoin. So if 1 BTC was 30k, you were getting $30/day. If BTC was 35k the next day, you got paid $35. You pay income tax on the income, payable in fiat. This then forms the \u201cbasis\u201d for capital gains purposes. So if you ever sold your Bitcoin, it would be taxed as capital gains on the amount in excess of your basis. \n\nHope that helps.",

That makes it no different from all the people out there that work for money under the table. (Plenty of contractors do that-I've seen it with people that work in construction-especially in rural areas). They still owe taxes... some of them pay taxes(as they're supposed to)... others don't because they're receiving straight cash and using that cash instead of a bank to buy things. The blockchain would be the worry there, but until/if you decided to put that on an exchange to cash out, tracking that actual transaction(s) to a specific person would be next to impossible(I would think). \n\nAt the end of the day, you still owe taxes on that but it's highly unlikely you'd be caught unless btc goes to 5 billion tomorrow and all of a sudden that 0.001 is worth a few hundred thousand(or whatever), you decide to sell and use an exchange to do so. \n\nI think that's one of the many areas where we need more clarity from the powers that be. If you do decide to report it, I'd find a tax accountant. The wallet you use should have the date you received it... go to the charts and see what btc was worth on that day. Give the tax accountant the date you received it, how much it was worth, and let them do the math(if there are multiple(days/transactions) and you don't want to do it).",

I feel certain technicalities like that aren't being talked about by the community and I highly doubt the government has thought that far ahead when it comes to btc and/or crypto in general. \n\nTrue. I'd probably open Trading View and go by what Gemini or Coinbase had it priced at when you received it.\n\nVery true though. Different exchanges vary in price... not quite as wildly as they used to. The funny thing is you could probably call the IRS or SEC and ask... and they definitely wouldn't have a clear answer for you on which exchange/rate to use.\n\nI'm just throwing this out there but when things do start sticking with more regulation and clarity... they'll likely try to force their CBDC on us and if you want to convert your btc to CBDC to pay taxes... that would be my best guess at what they do(just for tracking purposes on their side). But then... that goes back to your question of if they won't accept btc, aren't they considering it worthless? \n\nAs for me? I'm hoping btc continues to be accepted around the world so that I can just travel with it being my currency and not have to worry about any kind of exchange rate or tax.",

That is true power and that is what makes Bitcoin such a phenomenon IMO. No one forced you to spend or adopt Bitcoin...the people chose to trust Bitcoin and here we are. Pretty impressive.",

I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s just NASDAQ by another name. \n\n\nI still believe in the market and bitcoin, but one has to bounce back so the other can.",
