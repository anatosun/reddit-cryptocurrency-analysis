There's a lot of evidence for this already in the amount of bitcoin living in exchange spot wallets. An even easier-to-use example is an external hard drive to back up your photos and files. So few people with their livelihoods in their file storage use external hard drives.  Before automatic (centralized) cloud back up for iphones, people would lose all of their photos when they broke their phone. The fact that you have to buy a secure device, set up passwords and remember a large seed phrase can be a deterrent to bitcoin adoption. Storing most of your wealth in a hardware wallet will still be the recommended thing to do, but most people live paycheck to paycheck.  If you believe in bitcoin's benefits beyond a store of wealth asset, (i.e. replacing the petrodollar) then you have to believe in maximizing usage and adoption. Accessibility, especially in the beginning, is the most important thing Bitcoiners should care about or we will never \"cross the chasm\" of adoption. You still get protection from a government controlled currency even if a lot of the banking and payments are done in a centralized cloud environment.",

Flashy TPS numbers/smart contracts/contant hard forks don't work well on base chains.

Everything you mentioned was on-chain(settlement layer) related.\n\nThere's something essential which many AltCoin supporters haven't realised - An Altcoin performing a settlement layer as quickly as they do, and with as low fees as they do, is NOT a good, sustainable thing. \n\nFirst off, if you're buying from a Centralised Exchange, that's a problem, but I won't go into it as it's off-topic, but encourage you to do further research on why CEXs and KYC are to the detriment of your sovereignty.\n\nAs for interacting with Lightning, it's dead-simple at this point. Download a lightning wallet - Muun or Phoenix as a couple of examples and send an on-chain BTC TX - This will open a Lightning channel, which will mean you can send outbound via lightning (close to, minus on-chain+service fees) as much as you received. And then you can send and receive via lightning multiple, multiple times (until the channel is closed) with extremely low fees.\n\nOnce you're comfortable with that, and do some further studying in Lightning concepts, if you further interested, either run your own node or download Blixt wallet, which will allow you to open/close/manage your own channels, which means you can choose low-fee/no-fee peers to connect to, which means the service fees that service providers take are no longer taken.",

I\u2019m sorry your experience hasn\u2019t been the most pleasant, however the majority of hodlers will strongly disagree about the speed of transaction. And with the lightning network being utilized more it\u2019s becoming quicker. This is also why I enjoy Strike, super fast, low fees, and super reliable.\n\n> I\u2019m not arguing against BTC, I personally wish it wasn\u2019t the leader because it just isn\u2019t the best\n\nPerhaps you\u2019ve not found the right exchange yet?\nYou\u2019re letting your own bad experiences be your pitfall. Just keep reading and learning as much as you can on the subject from as many valid sources as you can. If it\u2019s not the best though, why dabble with it?",
