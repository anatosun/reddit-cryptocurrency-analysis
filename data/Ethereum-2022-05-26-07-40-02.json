These Regeanites sold us out to the Nsa. Stone cold. KYCed Web3 will be a human rights/freedom devoid Orwellian hellworld. Nothing but Trudeau bank siezure and political persecution in all 170 countries in the world.\n\nLike legitimately we're safer with cash and traditional community banks and brokers, than permissioned kyced eth layer 3 rollups with backdoor narcware run by Davos and the WEF and JP Morgan, the ODNI etc. It isn't even worth it. It's full China control grid firewall\n\nThere should be seperation of state and money. There should not be any ability of a liberal administrative state to prevent basic finance and commerce and to engage in confiscation for any reason, especially political persecution.\n\n\"well there's always a good reason, bad criminals, and so forth it must be done\"\n\n\"well some political dissidents may be extemist\"\n\nSo what you're saying is that crypto should just be like regular broker accounts where if the procedures of the law dictate it so in courts, you can be banned and precluded from services or have your money seized, you're deferring everything to western courts and procedures, a privilege 80 percent of the human population doesn't even have.\n\nThere is no point in pemissioned Web 3. No Point! This technology exists to nullify and exclude democracy and courts, it is a veto on any interference with voluntary human action in the informal economy, especially undeveloped nations.",

It was pretty clear that governments will want to tax and regulate crypto currencies, and that includes Bitcoin.\n\nAnd state issued coins have also been an inevitability pretty much from the first hour of Bitcoin. \n\nThere will always be possibilities to use web3 without any permission from governments. Depends on how many people want that and make use of it. They can only try to regulate, they can not control.",

Your misunderstanding of trustlessness and decentralization? \n\nInstead, you'll have lots of scams, lots of tokens, lots of tools, lots of noise. And you'll have tools to sort through the noise and reach the signal. Because there's no way to prevent noise from existing anyway.
