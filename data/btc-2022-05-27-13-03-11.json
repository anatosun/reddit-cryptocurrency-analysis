The reserve requirement is quite literally the ratio of reserves that have to be held instead of lent. With 100% reserve requirement the bank cannot lend money that's on deposit with them.\n\n> With 10% they can create 9 usd for every 1 usd deposited (900%). \n\nThey create the 9 USD when they loan. No loans no creation. If the reserve requirement is 100% they simply cannot lend out any of the deposits. If every institution maintained 100% reserves then M0 = M1 = M2.\n\nAlso the 900% inflation does not work like \"Alice deposits $100 in TheBank which then loans $900 to Bob\" which is how your example makes it seem.\n\nThe way we get to $900 is like this:\n\nAlice deposits $100 in a bank which then loans $90 to Bob and keeps 10% in reserve.\n\nBob takes the $90 and deposits it in his bank which then lends out $81 to Charlie and keeps 10% in reserve.\n\nCharlie takes his $81 and deposits it in his bank which keeps 10% in reserve and loans out $72.9.\n\nEtc.",
