You can see the Spread right next to the Order form. There is no coins sitting on the Spread price available for purchase or selling AND you are taking higher fees using the Market Order tab. \n\nIf you need an immediate sell/buy, place your Limit Orders a few pennies (above or below) and wait a couple minutes/seconds. And you saved on the Market fee and the Spread... and save even more in fees by opening \"Advanced\" trading tab.\n\nBut, hey... Thanks for paying all those extra fees so I can maintain my 0.1% pricing tier fee rate! Without you they would likely need to move the tier pricing rates. \ud83d\ude44",

Coinbase might be guilty of that, since one of the altcoins they endorsed were ponzies and so they entered a position and wrote promissory notes for a coin that extinguished, thus giving them the option to short sell crypto, and they so didn't lose any money and made a profit from an altcoin that experienced a 100% total loss.  You think coinbase loses because they paid full price for the altcoins so they can make the market.  No, they were promises to buy later, if or when you need it.\n\nAnother thing that should be illegal is to wrap an altcoin to create a short-selling instrument from it that Coinbase is doing to generate revenues.  If I sell you a promise that I will buy an altcoin in the future for you and I can use the profit from those sales to cause the ponzie to extinguish.  That would be a crime.\n\nProblem is the lawmakers haven't the foggiest idea how these things work.  When they do, a lot of stuff that's happening now is going to stop happening.",
