I was still a student, so had no income and with our banking infrastructure already so archaic and with how new bitcoin was overall, I brushed off any thoughts of doing a deep dive in it. Plus I was a kid. What do you expect?\ud83d\ude02\n\nThen I came to the us in 2017, still a student, still really low income. Thats when I heard my friend talking about how its price had gone up. I asked him what it was and what do you do with it. He gave me a very shallow explanation and that did not convince me enough. In any case I did not have any disposable income at the time to invest, so I went on with my life.\n\nThen in 2020 I had a good job, and was investing bit by bit like everyone does once they start making some money. I saw the price of bitcoin rise. And to be honest I thought of making a quick buck, so I bought some. \n\nAnd as happens with all investments, you start to read more about them once you invest in them. So I started listening to as much content as I possibly could to learn more about it. \n\nNow for why I stayed. I come from a third world country where gold is the main savings instrument people use. The stock market is usually deemed to risky by your elders and people live within their means, buy gold and finally pass on the gold to their children.\n\nThis made it very easy for my head to understand the bitcoin as digital gold proposition. I read as to why gold got deemed valuable. And it made sense as to why bitcoin would become the same if not more valuable.\n\nI also never had any hopes for democracy, because I would always see politicians enticing poor people with money to buy their votes. I could never think of a way it would ever change. After bitcoin I felt like it was a way to keep governments and banks in check, by making them compete in a free market fashion for your capital. And I felt that was the missing check part of the \"checks and balances\" for democracy.\n\nI want to see bitcoin as a part of my grandchildrens future. And I will always stay here till I die. (Unless ofcourse, I am convinced not to). Rational person after all.\ud83d\ude02",

But I respect that.\n\nEvery single argument about \"scaling BTC\" had already been beaten completely to death by 2018. You can read threads on Bitcointalk to save yourself the time of reciting the same tired Maxi talking points that were thoroughly debunked. There were fake Blockstream conferences about \"scaling Bitcoin\" which made sure that BTC did not scale. There was the Segwit fork (which, by the way, totally changed BTC protocol, to the point that every wallet had to be rewritten to support it) that was so unpopular it took 6+ months of bribing and cajoling of the BTC miners to ram through. And now even after Segwit, BTC still can only process 5 transactions per second at best.\n\nThe technical arguments for why the BTC network can only transfer one floppy disk worth of data every 8 minutes were obliterated over and over. The idiotic FUD about \"BTC nodes running out of hard drive space to store the blockchain\" was buried under mountains of scorn and ridicule, as a single $100 hard drive can store 30 years of BTC blockchain data.  It was only then that the narrative shifted: suddenly \"bitcoin\" was \"digital gold\", and was \"not for payments\", and \"only for storing value\". T**he technical arguments for not removing a blocksize limit which was added as a temporary patch to prevent spamming were utterly inferior,** **So the Maxies pivoted to avoid the elephant in the room.**\n\nFor anyone who was there during the scaling war, Bitcoin Cash was subjected to a massive negative PR campaign, run by Adam Back's (Blockstream CFO's) \"full-time teams\" on Twitter and Reddit. Around this time, Adam gave a speech, and when asked how to scale Bitcoin, he said \"you could open a TAB with your local business\". The people who didn't die of laughter were fairly upset that a person so stupid could be in control of Bitcoin Core development!\n\nCritics of Bitcoin Cash said \"the network will be spammed into oblivion\", and millions of dollars were spent on spamming BCH network. These came to be known as the \"stress tests\", and they inadvertently proved precisely the opposite: BCH did fine with continuous 16MB blocks. Fees never rose exponentially like the regularly do on BTC, and the BCH network has had 100% uptime since its inception. BCH has shown that Bitcoin can scale, and as Satoshi directly said \"it never really reaches a limit\" if SPV light nodes are used (and they are).\n\nCongrats on making a profit on BTC in 2020. It feels good to make money by making the right call. But remember that you could've just been lucky...",

                    "response": "How about this, I tell you my views and then let me hear what you think of it.\n\nFirst, I think these are undisputable facts:\n\n1. \"Bitcoin\" is the original invention created by Satoshi Nakamoto and presented to the world in 2009, the whitepaper describes an invention, a technology. The paper didn't foresee there could be multiple implementations of it, or how the ecosystem would evolve to thousands of similar inventions.\n2. Until 2017-08-01, \"Bitcoin\" unambiguously meant both the invention and the first and, at that time, only implementation of the invention. I refer to blocks 0 through 478558 as the first Bitcoin blockchain.\n3. With the block `478559`, the era of one Bitcoin was forever ended, and we got what is now known as Bitcoin Cash (BTC) and Bitcoin *Core* (BTC).\n\nOk, now for some rambling, points to argue about (unless you have some objection on the above, too):\n\nTechnically, both blockchains are \"Bitcoin\", as in instances of the invention. However, the whitepaper is not forward-binding in how the invention continues to evolve. No man is perfect and can see it all, and serve everyone, not even Satoshi. Future of P2P cash depends not on people executing *(their view of)* Satoshi's vision but THEIR OWN VISION for P2P cash. I'm not here to execute a \"dead\" man's vision, but my own vision, and I want to see P2P cash exists, I want to see it be uncensorable, unstoppable, empowering, enabling! Many want to see such P2P cash, and having visions of many people aligned around P2P cash will move things forward, and I'm seeing some good alignment in BCH community.\n\nEven if I will say BTC is nerfed because it will not live up to the P2P potential, it is still an instance of Bitcoin, the invention, and I acknowledge that market has spoken and decided that the same \"Bitcoin\" label will refer to a particular blockchain, whose currency trades as BTC, and is now loved by big tech and finance as a sort of digital gold and speculation vehicle. Let them have it. If you're buying it to get those sweet +% \"tendies\", go ahead and good luck, I bought some too! But I know what I'm buying and why. I think many don't. Even if I align with the vision for P2P cash doesn't mean I don't like to make money along the way :)\n\nI think BCH has potential to bring me way more than x2 x3 BTC can, which is why my BCH bags are bigger and I'm working hard on actually [doing something](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/group-tokenization/-/blob/master/CHIP-2021-02_Group_Tokenization_for_Bitcoin_Cash.md) to help move the needle. I expect the gains from BCH to be worth all my time and energy spent on this. BCH is also an instance of Bitcoin, the invention, one that may live up to the P2P potential, but as we have seen in 2017, that's not been enough to claim THE \"Bitcoin\" title, not as the invention, but a particular implementation of the invention that got the most market cap. Nothing is forever, and success of one doesn't preclude success of the other. If we grow big, the name won't matter. I like cash, and when I say cash I mean Bitcoin Cash :) **Market has spoken, but it never stops speaking, and I'm betting it'll start to speak more favorably about BCH.** Anyway, both blockchains are viable, they exist, they are used in one way or another, and compete with all the other blockchains to take the market cap.\n\nWith all that said, consider this... BCH is now at utility level BTC had back in like 2013/14, and I use this as metric: https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/activeaddresses-btc-eth-ltc-bch.html right?\nNow, BCH community is working to serve markets that actually need and want p2p cash, carving our own path away from mainstream speculators. What could we expect when that metric grows to parity with BTC and ETH? And ETH had problems with fees at those utility levels - WE WON'T, we can scale to grow 10x beyond that, and more...",

In other words money should be a good savings instrument.\n- Money should be able to be used as a form of payment.\n\nWhy did I write it in that order?\n\nBecause most of the times, you want to store money than spend it.

People going I like luna because free money, I like dogecoin because elon, I like monero because privacy. \n\nAll crypto currencies are in their infant stages. You can never expect the one you hold to be the winner of the popularity contest every day over short periods of time.\n\nBut the same market over a longer time period acts like a weighing machine, where right choices get rewarded and wrong choices get punished. Crypto due to the young nature of the market, lower market cap, high divisibility, global nature and accessibility, will take a longer time to iron out volatility. But bitcoin atleast has shown to store value over longer periods of time.\n\nStoring value is something done over years or decades or generations. If anyone expects to make a big purchase in the next 6 months, he wont put that money in an index fund. He'll just save it and accept the inflation for the surety of not losing any value after 6 months.\n\nAs for the growth of the currency, I feel you are thinking of it in the opposite way. \n\nHumans did not start valuing gold more because it was accepted everwhere.\n\nHumans started accepting gold because it was valuable to everyone.\n\nThe real adoption is when people want to be paid in crypto and set their prices in crypto. I beleive whatever adoption is shouted about bitcoin as well is all marketting. Adoption is when someone prices and accepts things in bitcoin and keeps it as bitcoin.

So one would not care about how well the money stores value.\n\nIf your income > expenses, you would budget to keep a portion in bad money for expenses and a portion in good money for savings. Needing only one exchange transaction every pay period.\n\nThe worst money is the one that cant be exchanged for goods or services even indirectly. Something like cat poop. No one is willing to exchange it for anything of value so its the worst money. With bitcoin as long as you are able to convert it to dollars and pay for things in dollars, it will serve as a valid mode of payment. \n\nExample: I cant use my dollars to buy a house in India. But as long as I can convert my dollars to rupees to buy the house, its a valid form of payment. But my inability to buy the house directly with dollars doesnt not make the rupee a better money than the dollar.\n\nFor the people for whom survival comes first are living jb a situation where income <= expenses. In their case, as I stated before, they are better off using the bad form of money ie the one they get paid in. This is because there is no surplus. And there first goal to a better life would be to get in a position where their income > expenses, and once they reach that point, savings become more important than payments.\n\nIts quite the opposite, a better money that you can trust to store value over time organically becomes a desirable form of payment. Thats why people working in tech are happy to be paid in stock, even though they can buy nothing with it for a year and after a year have to liquidate to buy anything, for the sole reason that they expect that stock to hold its value over time better than the dollar.",

Software upgrades. Don't upgrade? Things break.\n\nI think this is strawmanning the point.  Running the old software and having it still sync to the current chaintip **proves** that no rules you signed up for were broken. There may be additional rules that you don't care about, or even new validation things that you also don't necessarily care about, but that's not particularly relevant. If you're an only-occasional user of Bitcoin, and you go away for a while and come back, you'd somehow have to verify all the 'upgrades' that took place to make sure they didn't break any of the rules you cared about. By running an old client, you can verify it for yourself.\n\nOf course, that's not to say that it ought to be impossible to hard fork. It's just that there are advantages to making it safe and rare. Satoshi seems to agree, since he only deliberately hard-forked **once**, and that was to make soft-forking easier.",

Bitcoin was stripped of its capacity to process enough economic activity by keeping it limited to ~4 tx/second. The only advantage BTC has is the higher security (hashrate), which is a mere function of the price. I will go ahead and say what many believe:\nBTC is a *coup d'etat*, a false flag that nerfed Bitcoin.\n--------------------------------\nUnfortunately, indians are not able to transition out of the Rupee into Bitcoin to escape their inflation theft. Just like you describe, BTC has become a \"savings account\" for those with income > expenses, and unreachable for the vast majority of the world on income <= expenses.\nThis nerf is by design so that the world keeps being run by the Bank of International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the Federal Reserve etc and so that they can keep stealing human wealth with their money creation. BitcoinCash is what BTC is and more: humans can live on good money beyond any third-party attempts to prevent them from prospering.",

I think you are the first person who claims they don't feel the need for lightning (which in this case is just a placeholder for something separate from the BTC base layer specifically for payments).",

Now these people outnumber us massively and just decided Bitcoin was not peer to peer cash as they have the loudest voice, and it spiralled into this shit-fest of a casino and ponzi like scheme that is the majority of the crypto space today. While at the same time shitting on any project they are not \"invested\" in, and making peer to peer cash people's lives and jobs even harder and worse.\n\nIt wasn't enough for them they destroyed our work and original goals, they want to shit on our new projects as well, and assume everybody is the same as them, caring about price only.\n\nWe were given one of the most disruptive technologies/currencies in history..\n\n..yet all 95% of people care about is how much $\u00a3$ the next person will buy it from them for.",

You only believe in btc for store of value and not any l2 solutions or buzzwords, correct?\n\n-Why do you think it's a store of value when the market is so manipulated? CEXs, stablecoins like Tether and bad actors drain liquidity and manipulate the price. How are you so sure it will continue growing? Past success is not an indicator of future growth.\n\n-Even if it succeeds and keeps growing. Why is it a good store of value with its 1mb limitation? Say you have an emergency and need access to cash. Btc blockchain is limited to 400k transactions a day so what if you can't get your money out in time because of transaction speed? \n\n-Since (I assume) you live in India. What if your or other sizable populations adopt bitcoin as a store of value? It would take decades for everyone to do one transaction to own or sell. What if you want to keep saving money in btc and want to keep doing deposits every month? Only about 20m are limited to doing that and you would spend 100+ dollars/market prices (insane) transaction costs for every attempt at \"storing your value\" in btc.

I am only a bitcoin maxi after all, not a lightning maxi.\n\nDuring the blocksize wars, there were basically two schools of thought:\n- One group of users wanted to change the properties of bitcoin to make it easier for transactions.\n- One group of users wanted bitcoin to be the same (atleast the economics of it) and wanted products (even if they were centralized) to be created to fulfill every use case people would need from bitcoin.\n\nNow I completely agree to second group. Throughout human civilations we have always found the best form of money and then we changed our lives in order to keep using them as money. Never did we think of changing the money itself.\n\nIll give an example. In India, Jewelry is an enhancement we do to our money (gold) just so we are able to:\n- recognize our money from other peoples money.\n- show our money to other people, in vain, but yeah. It is what it is. People have an urge to be shallow.\n- to attach emotional significance to the money such that it makes it less likely that we would spend the gold. I still have most of the jewelry since my grandmothers time and I would not sell it unless its a life and death situation. \n- a husband would gift jewelry to his wife. Thus increasing its value in the wife's mind, increasing its chances to not be spent.\n- we also associated gods to gold, all to add a religious layer as to why not to spend it.\n\nWe never tried to change the gold itself to something else, say maybe because gold would lose its shine or when gold stopped becoming a valid form of payment. We have always built our lives around the imperfections of gold and that made us closer to perfect.\n\nOk so why not change blocksize. It changes the economics of the money and the mining. Gives a message that we can change it again if we want, this increases the difficulty for miners to plan around it and hence drives them away. It kind of became a hit on the security.\n\nWhats a use case without security in the underlying asset tending towards infinity? \n\nMy stance is if lightning is shit, it will die, but bitcoin wont. And a new lightning v2 or whatever would rise with a better idea of how to do payments.\n\nBut if the security of bitcoin cash ever gets compromised, there will never be any further advancements and bitcoin cash itself would die.\n\nThere might be more points, but I have written a long enough messages. I will get back to your follow up.\n\nThank you",

There isn't any evidence Satoshi added the blocksize limit in 2010 for any economic reason actually.\n\nBitcoin with non full blocks behaves radically differently from Bitcoin with full blocks.\n\nYou could argue that *technically* nothing changed (as opposed to economically). But even that I'd contest because in a growing system, if you have hard coded limits, once those limits are hit you're actually changing the system. Doesn't matter if the limit was technically there before because it had no impact on the system.\n\nCase in point: the blocksize limit of 1MB had no (economic) effect on Bitcoin in, say, 2011.

I feel it needs the other side of the story, the \"payments maximalist\" side :)\n\n> During the blocksize wars, there were basically two schools of thought: - One group of users wanted to change the properties of bitcoin to make it easier for transactions. - One group of users wanted bitcoin to be the same (atleast the economics of it) and wanted products (even if they were centralized) to be created to fulfill every use case people would need from bitcoin.\n\nIn its early history, the economics of the coin were such that transactions were low-fee. This stimulated a lot of adoption and led to Bitcoin being considered as a new form of money. (\"Internet money\")\n\nThe limit of 1MB was introduced to fight a spam wave, but before that, Bitcoin was not limited to 1MB. It's limit was closer to 32MB, blocks being restricted by the maximum size accepted for network messages.\n\nThis limiting to 1MB (for spam reasons) was in fact to turn out to be a big change to the economics, creating a possibility of very high fees. But Satoshi didn't want that to be a persistent state of the network - which is why he suggested on how to remove the 1MB limit later on.\n\nBefore 2017, many people warned about the change of economics that was being pushed on BTC through keeping the limit. Even Core developers warned about it (Jeff Garzik clearly described this change of economics on the dev mailing list).\n\nThe group of users who wanted to _keep_ it easy for transactions (as had been before, when BTC was growing successfully in adoption) didn't want to change the fundamental economics of the coin. They wanted to keep them, because low fees X lots of transactions is how the system was envisaged in the first place.\n\n> One group of users wanted bitcoin to be the same (atleast the economics of it) and wanted products (even if they were centralized) to be created to fulfill every use case people would need from bitcoin.\n\nThe group of people who wanted the economics to stay the same can't really be said to be the people who pushed for high fees and a split of the functionality of the network into distinct settlement + payment networks. Or centralized services (banks in effect). Obviously those change the economics substantially.\n\nBut this is the crux of the debate, and the reason for Bitcoin Cash forking to preserve what we see as the proven successful economic model that got Bitcoin to be valued.\n\n> Ok so why not change blocksize. It changes the economics of the money and the mining.\n\nIncreasing the blocksize means miners could earn more money by processing more transactions. That's the original design. And the plan was to increase the number of transactions while keeping low fees. That means increase the block size or somehow make more block space available, to keep up with demand.\n\nFor miners it is not a problem to keep up technologically because they actually earn money from this.\n\nHashing also doesn't become more difficult when the blocksize increases (this is a common fallacy).\n\n> Gives a message that we can change it again if we want, this increases the difficulty for miners to plan around it and hence drives them away. It kind of became a hit on the security.\n\nCapacity planning and budgeting for increases is a part of any industry, miners became professional and they can easily plan for upgrades, especially if they have a long time to plan ahead which they do.\n\n> if the security of bitcoin cash ever gets compromised, there will never be any further advancements and bitcoin cash itself would die.\n\nThere is no reason to suspect the security of bitcoin cash would get compromised. But even if, the example of the real world shows coins being compromised all the time and recovering. This is just an indication that the crypto market is almost entirely speculative at this point. Otherwise coins which are running for years without being compromised, like Bitcoin Cash, would be better understood.",

Thanks also for stimulating a civil discussion about the views.\n\n\"Maximalism\" indeed has various flavors.\n\nThere are some maximalists who call themselves that simply because they believe that in the end, better money will win out and consolidate around one coin.\n\nI consider that viewpoint to be fairly close to what many Bitcoiners thought in the early days.\n\nEven if I don't think nowadays it will happen like that, because of ... people. For many reasons, including curiosity, stubbornness, and a constant need to improve driven by real world events, I think there will always be multiple systems of money competing. Even physical forms have their use cases that Bitcoin doesn't cover.\n\nI am happy that Bitcoin seeded that space, and I think the basic design of Bitcoin is still in an excellent position to keep a lead on its competition in that space.",

I will never tell anyone to use btc for every single transaction in their life. Heck I dont do that myself. I pay for everything with my credit card, do bank transfer with zelle, cashapp, apple pay, venmo. I use ach for deposits. Its usually the person whom I am paying, I ask him what hes comfortable with and then I use that.\n\nI even use random shitcoins like Nano or something, the zero fee ones, to transfer between exchanges. Payments are a commoditized market and Ill naturally use the method that is the cheapest, and sometimes the fastest based on the situation.\n\nIf I was in your situation, I wouldve done the same thing that you did. I am pretty financially rational. You seemed to have no other option in your situation, so you picked the only method that was working. I would do the same.\n\nI am currently remitting an ultra large amount from india to US. Why did I not choose crypto to do this.\n\nIndian tax policy on crypto\nThe 28 per cent GST will be in addition to the 30 per cent income tax on earnings from crypto asset transactions. There is also 1 per cent TDS (tax deducted at source) on transactions in such asset classes above a certain threshold. Gifts in crypto and digital assets are also taxed.\n\nThe tax headache did not make financial sense and I did not want to be seen skirting regulations with such a large amount. So im doing the regular remittance method, Its been six months, I filled 10 forms and still I feel this method makes more sense than using crypto in India. I really dont want to be caught in any legal trouble due to the size of my transaction. And on top of that it might not even be cheaper with 28 percent gst and 1 percent tds. \n\nSo my point being whenever a situation comes where I need to make a payment, I see all my options, weigh my risk rewards, and make a decision about what payment mode I want to use. There will never be a one size fits all. \n\nMy bitcoin maxi position is that I use btc as a savings instrument as I feel it will work the best for that purpose. I dont spend it (coz then its not savings, its just bad budgetting). And for every payment, im agnostic and use the thing that makes the most sense from an options (is it my only option), economic (is it my cheapest options), fastest, and the most convinient for both parties involved (if my brother needs 100 dollars, I am not gonna force him to take it in any crypto).\n\nI hope this clears my stance.",
