The BNB chain team has also promised to support Terra migrants and their projects by connecting them with major cryptocurrency companies such as coin market cap and trust wallet, and yes, there is also a $1 billion BNB chain investment fund available for them to scoop from.\n\nBut being fully aware that aside from the BNB chain, there are also several other layer-1 blockchain networks such as Polygon, Fantom, Zetrix and Vechain which individually have their strengths and unique benefits for developers and projects built on their network.\n\nWould you therefore advise terra developers to latch on this BNB chain offer without considering their possibilities with some of these other networks?",
