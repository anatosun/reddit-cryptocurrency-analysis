I\u2019ve seen some generous people do it here already but basically I\u2019d like to make it more consistent and weekly on a random day at a random time to divvy out tips evenly across global time zones and schedules. Their generosity inspired this idea.\n\nRules: To be eligible you must be one of the first say 10-100 (still figure this exact quantity out) people to comment and be signed up for the Reddit sodogetip program to receive a tip from your fellow Shibe. \n\nWhy? I want more people to discover this community and help with the adoption. I also love this community and want to give back in a unique way.\n\nHow will you fund this? I\u2019ll fund it out of my own pocket with an interest generating account. Basically, my gains will equate to Dogecoin to be tipped out weekly among the community members for joy.\n\nAny thoughts? Any concerns?",

We often had hundreds of bots and fake accounts infesting tipping threads and basically stealing our money.\n\nWhat you do with your money is up to you of course. But please, do be careful.\n\nPersonally, I found being completely random and selecting only worthwhile content to reward is the best way. Because it\u2019s unpredictable and requires some actual effort with no guarantees of rewards for the leeches.",
