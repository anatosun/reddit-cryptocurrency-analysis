                    "response": "It's only a red flag if you've taken out a loan of ETH against your stETH, since the value of your collateral is falling in relation to the value of your loan and you could be liquidated. \n\nstETH is backed 1:1 by staked ETH, so there's really no reason it would depeg like UST did. The reason most staking derivatives *don't* trade 1:1 (BETH being the most notable) is because they aren't as useful as ETH and you're essentially paying a premium for liquidity while your actual ETH is locked away. LIDO has put a lot of funding and effort into keeping the stETH peg at 1:1 because it greatly incentivizes adoption of stETH, but trading between .95 and .99 is perfectly normal and frankly kind of expected. \n\nWhat really keeps these sorts of tokens close to 1:1 is the assurance that you'll be able to redeem the tokens at a 1:1 ratio once Shanghai launches sometime next year. As the tokens fall further away from 1:1, buying them is more and more appealing because you're essentially guaranteeing that you'll receive the difference in ETH post-Shanghai.",

Seems like a moot point though. \n\nLike, if the merge slips a few *years* this far along in the dev process with fully-functioning merge clients and all that, something is horribly wrong and we probably won't *ever* merge. In that case they'll probably just implement a way to retrieve staked ETH and LDO will be redeemable 1:1 again. \n\nBut really, this isn't worth worrying over. Mainnet shadowfork 5 went \"exceedingly well\" and Ropsten's merge config has already been put on Github. The Merge is coming, and barring any last-minute catastrophic bugs it's going to happen this year. Withdrawals from staking are somewhat trivial after that.",
