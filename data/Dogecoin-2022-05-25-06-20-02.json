Those that held actual dollars are losing as it's buying power is diminishing.\n\nWill dogde moon? No, it had its run, hit 70c from 0.00001 as a meme coin. It's holding around 8c due to those that bought it high and are holding to hopefully sell when they break even which would collapse the price again due to mass selling.",
