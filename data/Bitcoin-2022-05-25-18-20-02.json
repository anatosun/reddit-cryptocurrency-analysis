It's like most of you can't spend enough time doing research on how monetary policy is actually enacted, alongside your research on crypto. Imagine if you were as knowledgeable about the traditional financial system as you were on the intricacies of crypto currencies? Do you even know what you're defending, or fighting against?\n\nThe most ridiculous thing I keep seeing in this thread is some version of what you posted. Calling her out on her avoidance, feeling like a \"gotcha\" moment when she doesn't say explicitly how and when the balance sheet will be reduced. \n\nDo you know why the FED minutes are released at a precise date and time in the day? Do you know why anything Powell says has to be reviewed and carefully prepared? \n\nBecause these decisions, these plans *have* to be delivered across a specific timeline to avoid panic in the markets, panic in the banks, panic in the currencies. Reducing the balance sheet is something that we're expecting from both the FED and the ECB \u2013 when and how it is done exactly depends on how the economic situation develops, how the global economy behaves, whether we will enter a recession or not, etc etc.\n\nYou cannot simply get on TV and blabber on about exactly how and when and why we're reducing the balance sheet of the euro. It will come in due time is not just the right answer, it is the ONLY answer.\n\nIt astounds me that people in crypto circles just *have* to enter this contrarian attitude about fiat currencies and the way monetary policy is enforced. I've been into crypto since 2017 and every step along the way I've read people crying about the \"inevitable fiat collapse due next year\" or \"in five years\". It's always a year or five years away when you have absolutely nothing to show for in terms of actual arguments. \n\nEven pointing to the balance sheet graph and calling it a bubble is a dumb argument by the presenter in that video. A balance sheet doesn't work the same way as an individual stock, or a crypto currency does. Equating the two is ridiculous \u2013 a currency such as the Euro represents the livelihood of 800 million people. Crypto, for now, represents the speculation and losses of many, and the wealth of few. It is depressingly centralized in its volume when you look into the 65% volume share of USDT in worldwide crypto trading. USDT obviously isn't backed by real dollars and poses an enormous systematic risk to crypto markets, but sure, let's get a \"gotcha\" moment on Christine Lagarde while not understanding the position she's in, and the factors at play within modern monetary policy.",

Ukraine, Belarus vs Poland and the Baltics.\n\nThe problem is that you are throwing all the countries in the same basket as if their starting position was the same. Poland had already 3x higher GDP than Belarus and 5x higher than Ukraine in 2004 (that's when they joined EU) and the difference stayed pretty much the same. \n\nGDP of Croatia was higher in 2008 than it's now, they joined EU in 2013. Where is the positive influence of EU?\n\nCome on, what does it cost to admit that the EU is not a get rich quick scheme:)?\n\nMy point is that the growth of the region has come mostly from economic reforms within the countries and started already in 1990, long before joining EU.",

Talk about two-tiered justice...\n\n> [**[BBC] Christine Lagarde: IMF chief convicted over payout**\n> ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38369822)\n> \n> A French court has found International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde guilty of negligence but did not hand down any punishment.\n> \n> As French finance minister in 2008, she approved an award of \u20ac404m ($429m; \u00a3340m) to businessman Bernard Tapie for the disputed sale of a firm.\n> \n> Ms Lagarde, who always denied wrongdoing, was not present in court, having left Paris for Washington DC.\n> \n> The IMF board said it retained \"full confidence\" in her leadership.\n> \n> She said she would not appeal against the ruling: \"There's a point in time when one has to just stop, turn the page and move on and continue to work with those who have put their trust in me.\"\n> \n> The French government also confirmed its confidence in Ms Lagarde, who was reappointed to a five-year term at the IMF in February.\n> \n> On Friday, she told the trial she had always acted in good faith and the suspicion she had lived under for the past five years had been an \"ordeal\".\n> \n> Cases at the Court of Justice of the Republic (CJR) may not be retried but can be appealed against on grounds of procedural errors.\n> \n> Ms Lagarde's lawyer said his team would consider appealing, Reuters reported.\n> \n> **'Complicated and strange'**\n> \n> Ms Lagarde, 60, was tried on charges of \"negligence by a person in position of public authority\".\n> \n> Accused of allowing the misuse of public funds, rather than actual corruption, she could potentially have been sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of \u20ac15,000, but escaped a sentence and emerges from the trial without a criminal record.\n> \n> Explaining the verdict, which took many by surprise, Judge Martine Ract Madoux said: \"The context of the global financial crisis in which Madame Lagarde found herself in should be taken into account.\"\n> \n> She also cited Ms Lagarde's good reputation and international standing as reasons.\n> \n> The CJR is composed mostly of politicians rather than judges, and handles allegations of crimes committed by cabinet ministers in office.\n> \n> CJR trials are rare but in a similar judgment in 1999, it found another French politician, Edmond Herve, guilty of negligence over a contaminated blood case but did not punish him.\n> \n> The earlier decision rested on a legal article (in French) which allows courts to deliver a guilty verdict but withhold actual punishment.\n> \n> A lawyer for Ms Lagarde, Christopher Baker, told the Associated Press: \"The result of this last five years is nothing, which leaves us in kind of a complicated and strange situation.\"\n> \n> **Public outcry**\n> \n> Ms Lagarde's case originates in the early 1990s, when Mr Tapie was a majority shareholder in sports goods company Adidas.\n> \n> After launching a political career and becoming a cabinet minister in Francois Mitterrand's Socialist government in 1992, Mr Tapie had to sell the company.\n> \n> In 1993, he sued Credit Lyonnais, a state-owned bank that handled the sale, alleging that the bank had defrauded him by deliberately undervaluing the firm.\n> \n> By 2007, the long-running case was referred to binding arbitration by Ms Lagarde, who at that time was finance minister under conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy.\n> \n> A three-member panel awarded the compensation a year later, causing a public outcry.\n> \n> Last year, after eight more years of legal wrangling, a French court ruled that Mr Tapie had not been entitled to compensation and should repay the \u20ac404m.\n> \n> In its verdict, the CJR said Ms Lagarde should have asked her aides and others for more information about the \"shocking arbitration award\" that included damages of \u20ac45m.",
