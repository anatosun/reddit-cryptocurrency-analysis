And what would be the obstacle on using that same green energy to mine doge? none!  \n\n\nSome articles, with a malicious intent IMO, point out that \"dogecoin has an energy usage that's higher than most other altcoin\". And they are considering total energy usage, which will obviously be higher for one of the most used coins.",
