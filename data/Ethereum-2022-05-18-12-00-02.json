I can't unstake the ethereum nor trade the rewards until the network has moved on to eth 2.0.  So I only put in what I am willing to lose because this process could take years or even never be completed, in wich case your funds stay locked and out of reach!!!  So IMO, it is a higher risk higher reward kind of move.  Also, coinbase has high fees, maybe consider binance or kraken.",
