It\u2019s directly related to purchasing crypto or adding cash in local currency using a linked bank account. For security reasons, you won't be able to send crypto purchased with such funds off of Coinbase. To learn more about this, please read this page here: https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/sending-or-receiving-cryptocurrency/available-balance-faq. We hope this clarifies things for you!",
