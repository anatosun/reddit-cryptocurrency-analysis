            "selftext": "12 years ago, a legend named Laszlo Hanyecz became a part of the history of the crypto world. He used his BTC to buy 2 Papa John's pizzas and made the first commercial transaction with crypto.\n\nHe paid 10,000 Bitcoins. Of course, at that time, 10,000 BTC was worth just $41. Nine months later, it was worth $10,000. After five years - $2.4 mln. And just last year, the two pizzas were worth $630 million. Tho, today, this price is a little less dramatic.\n\nOn this great day, treat yourself with a slice of pizza! Just maybe use another cryptocurrency instead.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cl04v6njsy091.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a58fbdb9c047513307838e81a269e72ad958a33",
