When you buy a futures contract, you have no impact on supply.  If all the money invested in futures ETFs was invested in a spot ETF instead, the BTC price would be significantly higher.\n\nI'm convinced the legacy bankers and central banks are pulling strings to block the spot ETFs (happened in Australia 2 weeks ago, been happening in the US for over a year).  They like the futures ETFs because they suck money away from spot purchases.  For Brazil, a futures ETF means they don't ruffle any feathers with the powers that be.",
