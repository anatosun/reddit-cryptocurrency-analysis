That being said, I still wouldn\u2019t keep my whole Stash on it until it further proves itself. I use it as a hot wallet for a smaller amount of coins. I use a cold wallet (ledger) for the bulk. Just make sure the coins you are sending are on the doge network and make sure the receiving address it correct. Send a smaller test amount if your new and and want to be extra cautious. \n\nYou can not buy or sell from the mydoge wallet. You can only transacts in doge with it.\n\nHope that helps",
