I know in my country and close to my neighborhood theres a lot of gangs who corner people and beat them up until they give the phone passwords and more.\n\nIn order to avoid them being able to see and steal my crypto, could we get the possibility of having decoy accounts? So for example having a situation where you can set in your normal pin to access your normal account, and then you can set a second pin to show the decoy account in dangerous situations with a lot less on it. What do you guys think?",
