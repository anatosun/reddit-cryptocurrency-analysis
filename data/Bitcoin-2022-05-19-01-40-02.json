I\u2019ve placed buy orders at every $1000 price notch between where we are at and $10K. \n\nI don\u2019t want us to drop that far, but if we do I\u2019ll scoop up a lot of extra BTC and in the long run it will be great. Even though we\u2019re dropping, I felt nothing but happy to see my $29K trigger buy happen today.",
