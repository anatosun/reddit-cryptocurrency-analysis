There are, however, some circumstances in which i would consider selling.\n\nI, like many others, are in it not because we like the technology, but simply see cryptocurrencies as a potential way to make a fuckton of money.\n\nMy plan is really simple: if fiat doesn't become irrelevant by the time i can safely FIRE and crypto remains extremely volatile, i will sell not only my BTC, but pull out of most, if not all crypto and just no longer give a damn.\n\nNow the other option: if BTC actually manages to achieve what it set out to do and makes banks and fiat useless worldwide, why would you ever want to sell? The potential is there.\n\n>If everyone decides to stop HODLing at the same time to buy lambos, it goes to zero.\n\nWon't happen, it literally CANNOT go to zero, think about it.\n\nThere is a chance it loses most of its value and never recovers (or at least in our lives), in which case it'd fail. Or it succeeds, in which case its price would skyrocket beyond belief.\n\nThe thing is i still wouldn't give a fuck if it failed because i am not overinvested in crypto. I like to believe i am well diversified into other investments. Would it hurt? Yes, a little bit but i treat all the money i put into BTC as \"lost\" money that i won't ever see again.\n\nI've been DCAing for years now. I have seen my portfolio skyrocket with everything in green and excellent profits. I didn't sell and kept buying. Now, when everything is red i don't sell either - i keep buying and we'll see where this gets me.\n\nEdit: remember when BTC fell to like 3k and everyone jumped ship? Just for it to rally up back to 70k some time later? Imagine you kept DCAing through all of this and actually bought some on the way down.... Yeah.",

The only people buying and holding have a plan to get rich, and currently the number buying is significant.  Is it possible for you all to get so rich that you don\u2019t need to work?

If you don't know where you keys are, you don't own any Bitcoin!\n\nHot wallets store the keys with their data.  But make sure!  It could be a custodial wallet.  This means the keys are stored somewhere else, and all you have is an interface for asking someone else to do transactions on your behalf. The app author should provide this information clearly on their website.  If not, get a new app.\n\nCold wallets usually provide some means of secure backup.  A list of 24 words is the most common.  Make sure you take advantage of this feature.  No one else can retrieve your keys if you lose them or your cold wallet dies.",
