Laszlo was one of the earliest contributors to the Bitcoin Network, it's evolution, expansion, mining and adoption. He was (still is I think) a computer programmer and **the first person who suggested mining BTC with GPU**.\n\n2. People also forget that as easy as it was to just give someone 10,000 Bitcoins to deliver pizzas to you, equally easy was to mine those 10,000 Bitcoins.

It\u2019s regulating fiat activity. That activity just so happen to be the usage of Fiat to purchase Crypto. People are still more than welcome to use crypto to by crypto, or use crypto to buy fiat.\n\nFrom the sounds of things, local banks are having a hard time keeping reserves due to outflows, which in turn destabilized both them and the exchange rate. Capital Controls are the classic method of stemming this tide. Now theoretically, you could encourage all banks to hold Crypto reserves as well, and eventually I can see that happening. But since it isn\u2019t already in place, it likely won\u2019t happen during a war.",

This can help with performance, resource requirements, battery life, etc. \n\n* It shows the development team is still active and updating their software (this doesn't seem like a big deal, but we had to leave behind a *lot* of abandoned macOS software that developers never bothered recompiling to make 64-bit. Even many \"64-bit\" programs used legacy 32-bit libraries and wouldn't work). \n\n* Some time in the future, Apple is expected to drop Rosetta in a new macOS release (no one knows when), which means *only* ARM native binaries will run.

The next one happened almost exactly during one of the worst months on record for both crypto and everyone where we had the start of COVID and an oil crisis at the same time.

                    "response": "Wow is that title ever misleading...\n\nFirst off, I can't actually find the report anywhere. There's a bunch of people talking about it, but they seem to all point to the same twitter thread as this article, or to an article on Coindesk.\n\nSecond, it seems like this report was actually produced by Strike for Morgan Stanley, and they just announced a big payment processing deal using the Bitcoin Lightning Network, so it's not shocking they'd come to favorable conclusions for their own business model.\n\nLastly, those charts are a thing of beauty, and by beauty I mean misleading as hell. They seem to have picked smoothing ranges and scales that put Bitcoin in the most favorable light possible while doing the reverse for USD. The main thing being to smooth out the volatility in BTC price so it looks fairly stable. There was a massive swing from over 60k down to under 30k right in the middle of the highlighted range on [this graph](https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSD-potato-465x420.jpg) but there's narry a blip, and I'm pretty sure the price of chips didn't also crater 50% to keep up...\n\nAlso, the scales on those graphs... oh man the scales. I was going to just poke at this a little, but the more I poked the more fucky it got.\n\nFirst off, [that first graph](https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSD-potato-465x420.jpg) is painting a false picture of equivalence. It's actually overlapped two graphs with the yellow BTC line using the left scale and the blue USD line using the right scale, but if they've indexed them to each other I can't figure out what conversion they used. Overall the effect is to make chips appear cheaper in BTC than USD, but that's not the case, the graphs should be separate. They're also zero indexing the BTC graph and shifting the USD graph up significantly, which makes spikes on the USD graph appear much higher when if it were also zero indexed it would be almost flat for the entire graph.\n\n[The second graph](https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSD-2-492x420.jpg) is basically doing the same thing in reverse. It's got the graphs separated, but it's zero indexed the bitcoin graph to make it appear more stable while the USD graph starts at 175k and goes up from there. They should have either cropped the BTC graph or done some kind of log scale on the Y axis, because with it going up to 1000 the tail looks almost flat when it actually goes from almost 100 down to as low as 4 or 5.\n\nThey're massively glossing over how people actually get bitcoins in the whole analysis. The price of potato chips in BTC doesn't matter much if I have to buy the BTC first with USD just to spend it.\n\nThey're also glossing over the reasons for a lot of those changes, which amount to the price of BTC shooting up over the specific periods they've chosen for their graphs and analysis.\n\nIn short, the report doesn't appear to be public yet, it was probably prepared by an outside firm, it's looking through rose tinted glasses so think you can barely see light on the other side, and it likely doesn't represent anything like Morgan Stanley's official position, just a case being made by a department or by the outside firm, but without the report we can't say much. We definitely can't declare it the official position of Morgan Stanley like this article does...",

So it doesn't sound more ponzi-ish than the whole crypto ecosystem in general.\n\n---\n\nConsidering \"bank run\" scenario - it is indeed possible, and not only UST, but all decentralized stablecoins, including DAI, are subject. Luna has this meme that it is backed not by luna value, but by the \"value of the ecosystem\" (and they are quite serious about it in a sense that they have a popular payment app and that kind of gives UST inherent medium-of-exchange value).\n\nBut DAI, for example, is also mostly backed by ethereum, and, henceforth, \"value of ethereum ecosystem\".\n\nThe problem is the same with both of these systems: if the underlying collateral is overvalued and suddenly corrects (say, collective public perception of value of ethereum gone 0.1x due to some catastrophic black swan event), the arbitrage mechanism might not be fast enough to destroy stablecoins - and there will be too many.\n\nLuna has the same problem exactly - yes, they have arbitrage mechanism which allows to burn Terra and get more Luna (valued in dollars), and they have a reliable oracle, but this mechanism is rate limited (exactly to prevent uncontrolled minting and death spiral similar to IRON-TITAN story). Basically, that means that it can not crash in normal market conditions (but can dip, we've seen UST dip to 0.8 in one of the prev. year crashes, I think in May), but in case of some really drastic re-evaluation it can become unbacked.\n\nSimilar thing can, indeed, happen to DAI (which is over-collateralized so it is much harder to imagine, but still, a lot of DAI is locked in some smart-contracts and might not be even available for arbitrage, I believe).\n\nSo my judgment: not a Ponzi, but risky indeed. Reward also might be high, but it depends on a lot of factors (like outcome of \"great stablecoin war\", and also general adoption of UST as payment rails).",

Reasons that UST either no longer needs to be concerned about or never shared. Stable offerings like Iron relied recursive holding incentives for growth. This meant If you held the algo stable coin, you would automatically build your stable coin holdings. This was unsustainable and it led a feedback loop of capital flight simultaneously shrinking the value of the stable coin and its holding yield. This increased principal risk and lowered compensating returns.\n\nAs Iron and similar projects were too new for any economic foothold this death spiral of capital was too much to sustain the peg. In short, it was a shit coin driven by speculation with no real use and the speculation was too heavy for the peg to bear. The team incorrectly assumed their algo mechanisms were more important then their stable coin's economic use case.\n\nUST was smarter in the early stages by securing both uncorrelated and correlated economic uses that created a strong foothold. Services like Chai created a base of new UST users that had no clue how to use DeFI or what it even was. As time has passed, UST is now seen as a way to protect the entire DeFI industry from centrally controlled stable coins like USDC/USDT or more decentralized coins like DAI that still leverage the centralized coins previously mentioned. This is the same industry that was originally built on Tether. A stable coin backed by fairy dust, and yet it has held up its peg very well.\n\nAs UST has matured. it has become more resilient. UST is now secured by reserves of Bitcoin and even other alts. In the event of an unpeg under 98 cents, UST holders will have the option to exchange UST for Bitcoin/alts at a 2 cent loss. This helps to alleviate the pressures of a \"death spiral\" as holders will no longer need to be funneled back into Luna in the event of a fear driven sell off. The use of Bitcoin as a reserve asset and additional safety mechanism should be enough for even the largest UST doubters to feel more secure.\n\nIt's pretty clear UST is not going anywhere. The DeFI industry can not continue to be built on stable coins that can be frozen by corporations or the governments that oversee them. Developers already understand this and it is exactly why UST adoption has been sweeping through DeFI. We now have Curve's massive 4pool liquidity and UST bleeding into many ecosystems across multiple chains. UST is no longer as risky as it was during our markets largest crashes, and a much more immature UST already survived those.",

Kind of odd but do you.  It doesnt like we're objectively going to agree about much because you've kind of already made up your mind on the subject.\n\nHowever, i took a quick lool at the link you posted.  It's a LONG one so i'm going to have to give it a more proper read later.  But from a quick runthrough, i can talk about the main argument the OP makes.\n\nThe definition of a ponzi:\n\n>1. A scheme where the primary source of money comes from recruiting new people\n\nWhile this is definitely an indicator of a ponzi BTC generates income via market demand.  I'll not even talk about stocks, since OP decided to strengthen his/her argument by immediately trying to void a counter argument that weakens his/her arguments of btc being similar to stocks.  Let's discuss basic economic concepts of supply and demand.  If people start buying up all of the cheetos (or whatever specific item you want to use), the cost to supply cheetos goes up because the demand goes up.  What was originally let's say $1 for a bag could go up to $3 per bag because of demand.  The same thing applies to BTC.  It's price is driven by demand and  people are making money by having an assets who's price is increasing due to demand.  If someone buys BTC, the fiat or whatever they used to buy it doesn't go to another btc holder.\nAnother example is the price of energy in europe increasing dramatically due to supply issues caused by russia's bullshit.  Does that make buying electricity a ponzi scheme? No.  So i dont see how this argument holds unless you just flat out have a misunderstanding of how btc works.\n\n\n >2. A scheme where people who buy in earlier, get paid from people who buy in later.\n\nThis is called being an early investor and is applicable to many other scenarios, ponzis schemes and non-ponzis schemes alike.  People like to compare btc to the great tulip craze.  Was that situation a ponzi scheme creatr by the big tulip corporations? No.  It was market driven demand (weird how that keeps coming up) and those who had tulips before demand rose made more than those who showed up later.  But, again, this argument is a fallacy because it hinges entirely on the idea that the money or crypto a new buyer of btc uses to buy btc goes to someone who bought earlier.  We established that's not how btc works so this argument doesnt hold.\n\n> 3. A scheme that involves misleading the people who are buying into the scheme \n\nThis is definitely a red flag for a ponzi scheme but doesnt apply to btc.  There is some confusion on OP's part and a lot of people outside of the community due to a lack of understanding the history of btc itself.  While, yes, it was at one point trying to be an exchange of value lile a currency, this is no longer the case.  There are a number of btc forks that focus more on thisbapplication but the btc community has decided to focus on store value applicatuon.  Also i think there's a bit of a disconnect by the fact that btc is called a cryptocurrency.  Understandably, this can cause confusion about whether or not btc is a currency if you arent aware that the term cryptocurrency really refers to a categpry of assets that use cryptographic methods (i.e. blockchain) to record their data records.  The word cryptocurrency doesnt really describe an asset that is trying to be a day-to-day tradeable currency.\n\n> 4. A scheme that requires constant recruitment of new buyers in order to sustain itself\n\nThis goes back to the previously discussed supply and demand situation.  I understand that this is just one of a list of thing to look for when identifying a ponzi scheme but this one argument by itself applies to a lot of non-ponzi schemes.\n\n >5. A scheme that naturally collapses when either too many early buyers try to exit/cash out, or the income from new buyers dries up and the scheme is exposed.\n\nThis also goes back to supply and demand and the misunderstanding of how the price of btc fluctuates.  Again, this argument by itself can apply to the stupid cheeto and real world electeicity examples I mentioned earlier.  If you think those are ponzi schemes, well idk what to say really.\n\nAnd i'll hit OP's bonus red flag that he/sge threw in there because apparently btc stole his/her lunch money at some point\n\n>6. A scheme that is often ignored as being a scam as long as it continues operating and paying off people. It's not acknowledged as a Ponzi until a significant portion of investors lose their money\n\nAgain, this argument for btc being a ponzi scheme relies on that fundamental misunderstanding of how btc's. price movement works.",

This means UST price must go up. However, the Terra blockchain sees this and locks the staked LUNA in and prints more UST. This increased supply of UST cancels out any additional buy pressure and UST remains $1.\n\n2) When the opposite of 1) happens, i.e. people selling UST to buy crypto, the staked UST is locked and staked LUNA is introduced in the supply. This decreases UST supply and it remains at $1.\n\nWhat's happening now is essentially 1). People selling crypto for UST instead of fiat or USDT using CEFI and DEFi exchanges meaning more UST must be introduced to maintain peg. This means staked LUNA is taken away from supply. This causes LUNA price to spike. This results in FOMO and people staright up buy LUNA, further increasing its price.\n\nNow, when/if 2) happens, and people start seling UST to buy other cryptos, hell will break loose for LUNA. To maintain peg, LUNA will have to be mass printed to decrease UST supply to maintain peg.\n\nThe real question is, during this rapid UST adoption phase, we are seeing 1) happen. But will there be a mass UST selling to buy crypto? Or, after UST widescale adoption, will UST buy/sell pressure remain mostly the same?\n\nTo somewhat combat this, the LUNA devs bought a shit tonne of Bitcoin as collateral but I am not too sure how that all works.\n\nIf you still don't get how UST peg works, give this a read [https://www.crypticinvestor.com/2022/01/the-brilliant-algorithm-behind-terrausd.html](https://www.crypticinvestor.com/2022/01/the-brilliant-algorithm-behind-terrausd.html)",

That is the relationship between them that makes UsT a decentralized stablecoin. You can go on terrastation and see for yourself how your Luna is burned when you want UsT. \n\nHow is the peg maintained? Through arbitrage - this is the key word which is missing. 1 UsT will always equal 1 dollar worth of Luna. For example, if UsT slips to 0.98, arbitrageurs can buy UsT at 0.98 and exchange for Luna at 1 dollar. This buy pressure makes UsT go back up and it is sealed when exchanged for Luna as the UsT is burned. \n\nIf UsT is at 1.01, people can buy one dollar worth of Luna and exchange for 1.01 UsT. The Luna is burned. Arbitrageurs will then sell their UsT, decreasing the price.\n\nThe risk is massive outflows or inflows of UST to the point where arbitrageurs cannot keep up. Therefore, instead of redeeming UsT for Luna or viceversa, Terra will start offering btc to be redeemed. But SOLELY under the conditions that arbitrageurs cannot keep up which will probably never occur unless everything goes properly to shit - something more severe than a typical crash. During crashes, people sell their crypto into stablecoins so people would not sell their UsT (this is theoretical and my opinion though).",

Add to that staking rewards, for example there was a post here previously showing Charles hoskinson earning around $40million/year from staking rewards alone on the coins he allocated to himself. \n\nEven some PoW cryptos would premine a large portion of their supply to sell to the public via an ICO sale, Ethereum for example. This essentially classifies a coin as a security and comes with regulatory risk. \nBack in the day people would instantly label premined cryptos as shitcoins, now it's just standard practice. \n\nFor lunas case, that $10B that is intended to buy Bitcoin reserves comes from investors money ofc, but it's better used on propping up Luna and it's tokens than in Do Kwons pocket. The problem with all coins that arent PoW is not just centralization risk, but also that they cost nothing to produce and with no production costs there is essentially no floor. \n\nIn the case of stable coins if they lose their peg to fiat they are over, so makes a lot of sense to back them with Bitcoin.",

The only exception is that little town of Santa Fe who requested donations from its citizens to buy 6 graphic cards to mine BTC. Although, it does not mention that they have started mining, but they do mention that the mayor of the town is considering placing taxes on mining to combat inflation. Nowhere in the article does it say that Argentina as a whole is considering adoption, except for pre-IMF deal in August of 2021.\n\nTranslation: Myself, I\u2019m from a South American country.",

I read the white paper and spent a few months trying to find out more about it because it was actually something new, Turing complete code on the blockchain made it very different to bitcoin/litecoin/coloured coins etc. Took a while before I actually put any money in because it was definitely presented as an interesting platform on which more things can be built, rather than something that would necessarily accrue value like bitcoin.\n\nDoes that mean it was shilled? Yea I guess so. And now there's no chance I would bother putting time into researching something suggested by an anonymous PM!",

You can do the same by spinning up your own node or clicking one on AWS but Infura is more convenient and cheaper. It's just there and you can use it. The argument for calling in a single point of failure is that if Infura goes down Dapps using them will become unusable. The argument against it is that no data will be lost and it's just one of many ways to ways to interact with the chain, apps can switch to another API, i.e. running their own node. You pick which one you agree with most.",

You deposit that into AAVE. then you borrow 10k stablecoins (with your 100k ethereum as collateral), and then convert the stablecoins to fiat and spend it on whatever you like. you currently \"owe\" $10k to the aave protocol.\n\nA typical interest rate on these loans is 4%, so in 1 year you owe $10.4k to the aave protocol.\n\nbut you've never made any payments. aave just says you owe them 4% more than you did when you took out the loan.\n\nAt the same time, your 100k eth (which lets say grows at 20%/year) is now worth 120k.\n\nso your collateral for the loan (the ethereum) is growing in value much faster than the interest on the loan is accruing.\n\nso you'll never have to make a payment. the amount you owe relative to the value of your collateral is actually decreasing over time, even though you're not making any payments.\n\nthe rich do this with their stock portfolios, its called a \"securities backed line of credit\", the rich all use it so that they can live off of their stocks without selling them.",

Nothing about decentralized finance makes these things possible; the lack of regulation does. Everything on this list should send up gigantic blaring red sirens in your head because they are literally too good to be true. \n\n A \"no-risk lottery\" means that the expected value of your return is *exactly the same as the interest rate* assuming that the \"lottery\" isn't taking any off of the top. It's not a lottery, it's a shittier bank account that's not insured and may not even pay you interest at all. This is like the first week of stats stuff. \n\nA \"guaranteed\" 20% yield account is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE. No one can guarantee growth, especially long-term and super especially in the crypto world. If you read the white paper it emphasizes the stability of their interest rate throughout. Banks can reasonably guarantee their interest rates because they're very low and their income is diversified among *stable* assets, and even those rates fluctuate a lot. If banks can't get stable interest rates with assets many times less volatile and many times more valuable, then Anchor certainly cannot. There's not a single fund in the world that can hit a 20% return consistently, and if one did it would be the only financial institution on the planet because every single dollar in existence would be invested in their fund. We would have to invent an anti-viagra to stop the hospitals from being overwhelmed by bankers with priapisms from their permanent erections. If I listed all of the reasons that a guaranteed 20% yield is impossible it would reach the character limit.\n\nThere's also an index fund for crypto which is hilarious. If you want an index fund for crypto then buy BTC or ETH. Every other crypto is effectively pegged to the value of those two coins because the market value of crypto is determind almost entirely by speculation and those two coins are the ones people know, as well as the fact the BTC and ETH underly the stablecoins and other crypto projects. An index fund isn't beneficial when basically every entity in the market moves in the same direction, at the same time, directly proportional to two dominant players. An index fund is supposed to track the overall value of the market and therefore provide stability you cannot get with individual stocks, but when bitcoin drops 20% your 100 CumCoins are going to drop as much or more. \n\nAlso one of the items on this list is described as \"tranched volatility derivatives\". Tranched. Volatility. Derivatives. Tranched volatility derivatives!!! You know, THE THINGS THAT COLLAPSED THE GLOBAL ECONOMY THAT ONE TIME. Except the ones that collapsed the global economy actually had underlying assets!!\n\nThis is the stuff that makes talking to crypto enthusiasts so frustrating. There's a pervasive ignorance of how the financial system works and specifically *why* it works that way. The reason traditional finance doesn't have the low-risk high-reward opportunities crypto does is because they're illegal. The reason they're illegal is *because they're scams*. If anyone ever tells you that they can guarantee you'll make a bunch of money with no risk, you need to physically assault them and then leave. We've been through all of this before and we created regulations to put a bandaid on the problems. These crypto investment opportunities ripped that band-aid off and went at the wound with a hacksaw. \n\nThe worst part is that people will refuse to accept the fundamental and unfixable problems because they have dollar signs in their eyes. Prior to the 2008 crash there were people raising alarm bells but no one listened because turning a blind eye was the only option if they wanted to keep making money. It's impossible to make someone understand something when their wallet requires they don't. \n\nBut this time is totally different guys, I'm just spreading FUD because I love banks/don't understand the tech/have so much fun being poor.",

So is defi lending actually revolutionary?\n\nAbsolutely not. Fully collateralized loans are the oldest, most primitive type of lending. It\u2019s the pawn shop model. You give them something worth more than they lend you, so if you can\u2019t pay back they\u2019ve already secured themselves. \n\nRevolutionary was the credit score, where institutions can suddenly give out uncollateralized loans to the masses, because their algorithms do a good enough job of assessing risk.\n\nDefi is pretending to do this. It pretends to be performing sophisticated loans with fully anonymous participants. Something unheard of in the modern world! But it\u2019s not because obviously that wouldn\u2019t work. You have to know who you\u2019re lending to to guarantee they\u2019ll pay you back, or take full collateral up front. \n\nWill it get there? Maybe, I never want to be cynical about human potential. But for now it is a budding technology exploring a well know space. \n\nSo that\u2019s to say, anytime you see high yield guarantees run away. Because there is counterparty risk there and it\u2019s gotta be massive.",

If people were okay with paying 20% interest for borrowing a stablecoin, any other lending market such as Aave would have those rates and Anchor would not be necessary.\n\nAnchor functions as an aggregation of both yield sources. It takes yield from the interest bearing assets (for example, if you deposit bETH as collateral), as well as users' interest from borrows.\n\nThis does not currently amount to 20% yield based on the amount of UST being lent right now. This is because way too many people are lending UST, and not enough people are depositing yield-bearing collateral or borrowing from the protocol. As a result, the protocol's reserves are slowly being drained, and will be depleted at some point if no action is taken.\n\nThere are a lot of resources out there discussing possible routes to take to bring the protocol to a more sustainable level of yield vs longevity, I personally recommend this video that went pretty in-depth into possible solutions: https://youtu.be/kobiOyU092M",

You deposit that into AAVE. then you borrow 10k stablecoins (with your 100k ethereum as collateral), and then convert the stablecoins to fiat and spend it on whatever you like. you currently \"owe\" $10k to the aave protocol.\n\nA typical interest rate on these loans is 4%, so in 1 year you owe $10.4k to the aave protocol.\n\nbut you've never made any payments. aave just says you owe them 4% more than you did when you took out the loan.\n\nAt the same time, your 100k eth (which lets say grows at 20%/year) is now worth 120k.\n\nso your collateral for the loan (the ethereum) is growing in value much faster than the interest on the loan is accruing.\n\nso you'll never have to make a payment. the amount you owe relative to the value of your collateral is actually decreasing over time, even though you're not making any payments.\n\nthe rich do this with their stock portfolios, its called a \"securities backed line of credit\", the rich all use it so that they can live off of their stocks without selling them.",

Everything on this list should send up gigantic blaring red sirens in your head because they are literally too good to be true. \n\n A \"no-risk lottery\" means that the expected value of your return is *exactly the same as the interest rate* assuming that the \"lottery\" isn't taking any off of the top. It's not a lottery, it's a shittier bank account that's not insured and may not even pay you interest at all. This is like the first week of stats stuff. \n\nA \"guaranteed\" 20% yield account is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE. No one can guarantee growth, especially long-term and super especially in the crypto world. If you read the white paper it emphasizes the stability of their interest rate throughout. Banks can reasonably guarantee their interest rates because they're very low and their income is diversified among *stable* assets, and even those rates fluctuate a lot. If banks can't get stable interest rates with assets many times less volatile and many times more valuable, then Anchor certainly cannot. There's not a single fund in the world that can hit a 20% return consistently, and if one did it would be the only financial institution on the planet because every single dollar in existence would be invested in their fund. We would have to invent an anti-viagra to stop the hospitals from being overwhelmed by bankers with priapisms from their permanent erections. If I listed all of the reasons that a guaranteed 20% yield is impossible it would reach the character limit.\n\nThere's also an index fund for crypto which is hilarious. If you want an index fund for crypto then buy BTC or ETH. Every other crypto is effectively pegged to the value of those two coins because the market value of crypto is determind almost entirely by speculation and those two coins are the ones people know, as well as the fact the BTC and ETH underly the stablecoins and other crypto projects. An index fund isn't beneficial when basically every entity in the market moves in the same direction, at the same time, directly proportional to two dominant players. An index fund is supposed to track the overall value of the market and therefore provide stability you cannot get with individual stocks, but when bitcoin drops 20% your 100 CumCoins are going to drop as much or more. \n\nAlso one of the items on this list is described as \"tranched volatility derivatives\". Tranched. Volatility. Derivatives. Tranched volatility derivatives!!! You know, THE THINGS THAT COLLAPSED THE GLOBAL ECONOMY THAT ONE TIME. Except the ones that collapsed the global economy actually had underlying assets!!\n\nThis is the stuff that makes talking to crypto enthusiasts so frustrating. There's a pervasive ignorance of how the financial system works and specifically *why* it works that way. The reason traditional finance doesn't have the low-risk high-reward opportunities crypto does is because they're illegal. The reason they're illegal is *because they're scams*. If anyone ever tells you that they can guarantee you'll make a bunch of money with no risk, you need to physically assault them and then leave. We've been through all of this before and we created regulations to put a bandaid on the problems. These crypto investment opportunities ripped that band-aid off and went at the wound with a hacksaw. \n\nThe worst part is that people will refuse to accept the fundamental and unfixable problems because they have dollar signs in their eyes. Prior to the 2008 crash there were people raising alarm bells but no one listened because turning a blind eye was the only option if they wanted to keep making money. It's impossible to make someone understand something when their wallet requires they don't. \n\nBut this time is totally different guys, I'm just spreading FUD because I love banks/don't understand the tech/have so much fun being poor.",

So is defi lending actually revolutionary?\n\nAbsolutely not. Fully collateralized loans are the oldest, most primitive type of lending. It\u2019s the pawn shop model. You give them something worth more than they lend you, so if you can\u2019t pay back they\u2019ve already secured themselves. \n\nRevolutionary was the credit score, where institutions can suddenly give out uncollateralized loans to the masses, because their algorithms do a good enough job of assessing risk.\n\nDefi is pretending to do this. It pretends to be performing sophisticated loans with fully anonymous participants. Something unheard of in the modern world! But it\u2019s not because obviously that wouldn\u2019t work. You have to know who you\u2019re lending to to guarantee they\u2019ll pay you back, or take full collateral up front. \n\nWill it get there? Maybe, I never want to be cynical about human potential. But for now it is a budding technology exploring a well know space. \n\nSo that\u2019s to say, anytime you see high yield guarantees run away. Because there is counterparty risk there and it\u2019s gotta be massive.",

If people were okay with paying 20% interest for borrowing a stablecoin, any other lending market such as Aave would have those rates and Anchor would not be necessary.\n\nAnchor functions as an aggregation of both yield sources. It takes yield from the interest bearing assets (for example, if you deposit bETH as collateral), as well as users' interest from borrows.\n\nThis does not currently amount to 20% yield based on the amount of UST being lent right now. This is because way too many people are lending UST, and not enough people are depositing yield-bearing collateral or borrowing from the protocol. As a result, the protocol's reserves are slowly being drained, and will be depleted at some point if no action is taken.\n\nThere are a lot of resources out there discussing possible routes to take to bring the protocol to a more sustainable level of yield vs longevity, I personally recommend this video that went pretty in-depth into possible solutions: https://youtu.be/kobiOyU092M",

Laszlo was one of the earliest contributors to the Bitcoin Network, it's evolution, expansion, mining and adoption. He was (still is I think) a computer programmer and **the first person who suggested mining BTC with GPU**.\n\n2. People also forget that as easy as it was to just give someone 10,000 Bitcoins to deliver pizzas to you, equally easy was to mine those 10,000 Bitcoins. The guy was one of the earliest miners and could've easily get those 10,000 in a day or so.",

I read the white paper and spent a few months trying to find out more about it because it was actually something new, Turing complete code on the blockchain made it very different to bitcoin/litecoin/coloured coins etc. Took a while before I actually put any money in because it was definitely presented as an interesting platform on which more things can be built, rather than something that would necessarily accrue value like bitcoin.\n\nDoes that mean it was shilled? Yea I guess so. And now there's no chance I would bother putting time into researching something suggested by an anonymous PM!",

What sane person wants to put their money into the wild west of finance? You rarely find people who have a savings account or retirement fund these days.\n\n\nFor now atleast the market speaks for itself and it values decentralization and you know it's not the mainstream market letting this happen. I personally know that because Bitcoin and Ethereum are number 1 and 2. If by some chance there was a true mainstream adoption then Ethereum for sure wouldn't be number 2 and Bitcoin could also be threatened for its spot. \n\nI don't think we will see mainstream adoption any time soon and it is why I position my portofilio with Eth and Bitcoin because its obvious to me that the mainstream adopters would be turned off by the complicated hurdles you just listed. The reason Eth and Btc stay 1 and 2 is because crypto enthusiasts brought it to the top then institutional investors and ameatur investors dipping their toes in the market hopped that train making them too big to fail. Crypto enthusiasts will continue letting these two at the top because they are the most decentralized coins in demand that have a usecase and solve a problem for users in the crypto space that im not sure I could say the same for mainstream adopters.",

I would personally have those monetary policies be decided by someone appointed by a publicly accountable official instead of a group of people with zero accountability.\n\nAt the end of the day you are putting trust in the US government's monetary policy.

Most people loose their shirt if they get in because they buy when it\u2019s hype and panic when it\u2019s times like these. If you\u2019re making money in crypto, you\u2019re different. We can be proud of that but we also need to keep perspective. \n\n\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf agree with this post OP. I rarely am I\u2019m crypto spaces. I watch my charts, I pay attention to world events and I trade. I honestly think TG and Twitter are probably the best because if you can be objective you can catch a lot early in these places. But overall people talking about 1m$ btc and 20k eth or whatever is just not helpful. There\u2019s already enough noise in the world and keeping things simple has helped me stay calm and profitable. These forums and crypto spaces can send your emotions and mind in all sorts of directions and get you off of your own strategy.

This industry needs regulation and utility.\n\nThere needs to either be a compelling reason to use the coin or w/e product a token is used for. Low fees are a start, but why would I bend over backward to figure this shit out, risk being hacked or accidentally sending my savings to the void, etc just to save a 1-2% fee from USD (especially when I have to pay an upfront fee on an exchange just to start using it). To many of us, those steps are pretty easy, but to the average user this shit is too convoluted. Don\u2019t even get me started on tokens that are used for products that are half built or serve no purpose.\n\nNFTs are unanimously viewed as a scam outside of this sub. They have no purpose either at this point other than to try to make money. They need more use cases and a culture around them other than to buy to re-sell for a profit. Just look at any game publisher that tries to announce NFTs \u2014 they get shit on by the community until they change their mind.\n\nAs it stands now, the pros of crypto are: fast transactions and low fees, or a half built product that may one day be great. The cons are: complicated taxes, exchange fees, mostly uninsured, prone to theft, prone to mistakenly losing it all, and a complicated process to acquire. Most of those cons can be addressed and once they are I think crypto\u2019s image will improve",

In fact it hasn't even broken the 0.8 mark into high correlation. And hasn't even broken into 0.7 correlation.\n\nHere's the correlation of Bitcoin to the S&P500: [https://charts.coinmetrics.io/correlations/](https://charts.coinmetrics.io/correlations/)\n\nAs you can see, even in this last few months of higher correlation than usual, it has mostly stayed between moderate correlation (0.59) and weak correlation (0.38). Only briefly getting close to 0.7.\n\nBut most of the time it's just doing its own thing.\n\nWhat's also interesting if you compare a Dow Jones or S&P 500 chart, is if you look at the dips of Bitcoin, half the time they start dipping before stocks.\n\nLike in the stock dips in January. They followed Bitcoin's lead.\n\nSo in your assumption that the correlation is not coincidental, does that mean that the stock market sometimes follows Bitcoin? Probably not. So we have to assume that some of the occasional correlation to stocks has to at least be sometimes coincidental.\n\nWhat does become evident if you analyze the data, is if Bitcoin is already on a trend, if stocks go in that same trend, the Bitcoin trend will be amplified.\n\nSo stocks seem to only serve to amplify a weakness or a trend that Bitcoin is already more susceptible to go into.\n\nIt seems that a lot of posts these days, don't bother to offer any data, and jump straight to a conclusion in the minimal amount of supporting argument.\n\n*Edit: the chart can't be linked directly, you have to go pick S&P 500 and Bitcoin, and do a USD correlation.*",

They didn't have the idea for the first internet forum or social network -- Myspace came out before facebook, and of course things like blogs and AOL profiles existed before. \"Let's have a facebook / yearbook online for Harvard\" is great but not that unique either, and ultimately they didn't sue over the idea, but whether they had a contract with Mark that he violated, and I think they even got money by settling. \n\nSo I mean, two frat boys had a generic idea, expected someone else to do the work, sued the creators with dad's money, and successfully got a chunk of the pie.

The truth is, more women are risk-averse than men, for various reasons having to do with biology, babies, and culture. Does that mean you don't know a woman who's far less risk-averse than you? No, it doesn't. But it does mean that the average woman is more risk-averse than the average man. Crypto appears to be a higher risk investment/gamble to people who aren't very familiar with it. So a lot of risk-averse men who don't know much about crypto aren't interested in it and a lot of risk-averse women who don't know much about it aren't interested in it, and there just happen to be more risk-averse women because the mean of their bell-curve for risk-aversion sits slightly to the right (greater risk-aversion) of the mean of the men's bell-curve for risk aversion. \n\nThe barrier to entry, if you will, is higher for cryptocurrencies than for other investments because it's easier to know that Amazon or some Big Pharma company is doing well these days without having to know much more than popular culture, than it is to know if DOT or SOL are doing well. To know if SOL is promising, you have to understand what it offers, what it's actually planning to do and what it actually does, but also what its competitors are doing, and then on top of that if it's trendy with the right people (because come on, Shiba Inu? :D ).  And you have to know if China or the US or the EU will wake up tomorrow morning and decide to ban it all. \n\nMost people in general don't have the bandwidth or the interest to do the research required, to spend the time needed, to figure all of that out. Specially not for an investment that is perceived to carry higher risk. So you're going to lose most risk-averse people and \"slightly less risk-averse but unwilling to spend a lot of time researching something when they could just buy Amazon stock instead.\" (I'm not saying Amazon is a safe buy or a good buy - especially with China going back under lockdown. I'm just suggesting that most mainstream, regular people, would consider it a safe enough bet compared to cryptocurrencies they know nothing about, without doing any research, and they're comfortable with that.)\n\nSo if you want your daughter to be into cryptos, the solution isn't to promote a podcaster who happens to be a woman. There are plenty of women interested in crypto who have never been exposed to... warm and gentle? crypto websites, or female podcasters or whatever a website that's more appealing to women might be. She might have to be less risk-averse. But that comes with other consequences and implications that might not win the pros and cons process... :D \n\nYes, because more men are into cryptos than women, more men are becoming crypto-millionaires.  Also more men are losing their kids' college funds, savings, their homes, etc. \n\nThe idea that women have to be the same as men in order to be equal or in order for things to be okay.. I find that bothersome. I think I'm equal to the men I'm equal to without having to be the same as them. We're different, and that's okay.  However, if a woman wants to be a crypto-podcaster and other people love her podcasts and she gains a big following, that's wonderful! But let's not try to engineer it by pretending that all women are the same and all women just need a female voice to tell them about cryptos in order to become interested in it, or a friendlier website (whatever that means).. Although if you want to try it, I'd totally check it out if the content was good. But not just because it's a woman talking or the website is... female-friendly (again, I really don't know what that means...).   \nOMG, thank you for letting me rant, lol!",

Meanwhile, Algo is at the mercy of Bitcoin and supply vs demand dynamics. When the supply runs dry Algo will have it's time to shine. Getting into Algorand is a long-term investment which will pay off, for those who have the patience.",

You deposit that into AAVE. then you borrow 10k stablecoins (with your 100k ethereum as collateral), and then convert the stablecoins to fiat and spend it on whatever you like. you currently \"owe\" $10k to the aave protocol.\n\nA typical interest rate on these loans is 4%, so in 1 year you owe $10.4k to the aave protocol.\n\nbut you've never made any payments. aave just says you owe them 4% more than you did when you took out the loan.\n\nAt the same time, your 100k eth (which lets say grows at 20%/year) is now worth 120k.\n\nso your collateral for the loan (the ethereum) is growing in value much faster than the interest on the loan is accruing.\n\nso you'll never have to make a payment. the amount you owe relative to the value of your collateral is actually decreasing over time, even though you're not making any payments.\n\nthe rich do this with their stock portfolios, its called a \"securities backed line of credit\", the rich all use it so that they can live off of their stocks without selling them.",

Nothing about decentralized finance makes these things possible; the lack of regulation does. Everything on this list should send up gigantic blaring red sirens in your head because they are literally too good to be true. \n\n A \"no-risk lottery\" means that the expected value of your return is *exactly the same as the interest rate* assuming that the \"lottery\" isn't taking any off of the top. It's not a lottery, it's a shittier bank account that's not insured and may not even pay you interest at all. This is like the first week of stats stuff. \n\nA \"guaranteed\" 20% yield account is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE. No one can guarantee growth, especially long-term and super especially in the crypto world. If you read the white paper it emphasizes the stability of their interest rate throughout. Banks can reasonably guarantee their interest rates because they're very low and their income is diversified among *stable* assets, and even those rates fluctuate a lot. If banks can't get stable interest rates with assets many times less volatile and many times more valuable, then Anchor certainly cannot. There's not a single fund in the world that can hit a 20% return consistently, and if one did it would be the only financial institution on the planet because every single dollar in existence would be invested in their fund. We would have to invent an anti-viagra to stop the hospitals from being overwhelmed by bankers with priapisms from their permanent erections. If I listed all of the reasons that a guaranteed 20% yield is impossible it would reach the character limit.\n\nThere's also an index fund for crypto which is hilarious. If you want an index fund for crypto then buy BTC or ETH. Every other crypto is effectively pegged to the value of those two coins because the market value of crypto is determind almost entirely by speculation and those two coins are the ones people know, as well as the fact the BTC and ETH underly the stablecoins and other crypto projects. An index fund isn't beneficial when basically every entity in the market moves in the same direction, at the same time, directly proportional to two dominant players. An index fund is supposed to track the overall value of the market and therefore provide stability you cannot get with individual stocks, but when bitcoin drops 20% your 100 CumCoins are going to drop as much or more. \n\nAlso one of the items on this list is described as \"tranched volatility derivatives\". Tranched. Volatility. Derivatives. Tranched volatility derivatives!!! You know, THE THINGS THAT COLLAPSED THE GLOBAL ECONOMY THAT ONE TIME. Except the ones that collapsed the global economy actually had underlying assets!!\n\nThis is the stuff that makes talking to crypto enthusiasts so frustrating. There's a pervasive ignorance of how the financial system works and specifically *why* it works that way. The reason traditional finance doesn't have the low-risk high-reward opportunities crypto does is because they're illegal. The reason they're illegal is *because they're scams*. If anyone ever tells you that they can guarantee you'll make a bunch of money with no risk, you need to physically assault them and then leave. We've been through all of this before and we created regulations to put a bandaid on the problems. These crypto investment opportunities ripped that band-aid off and went at the wound with a hacksaw. \n\nThe worst part is that people will refuse to accept the fundamental and unfixable problems because they have dollar signs in their eyes. Prior to the 2008 crash there were people raising alarm bells but no one listened because turning a blind eye was the only option if they wanted to keep making money. It's impossible to make someone understand something when their wallet requires they don't. \n\nBut this time is totally different guys, I'm just spreading FUD because I love banks/don't understand the tech/have so much fun being poor.",

But there is a legitimate reason they don\u2019t, which OP started with:\n\n>\tDefi is offering a revolutionary new way of loaning money\n\nRevolutionary technology does generate  \u201cunbelievable\u201d wealth. So is defi lending actually revolutionary?\n\nAbsolutely not. Fully collateralized loans are the oldest, most primitive type of lending. It\u2019s the pawn shop model. You give them something worth more than they lend you, so if you can\u2019t pay back they\u2019ve already secured themselves. \n\nRevolutionary was the credit score, where institutions can suddenly give out uncollateralized loans to the masses, because their algorithms do a good enough job of assessing risk.\n\nDefi is pretending to do this. It pretends to be performing sophisticated loans with fully anonymous participants. Something unheard of in the modern world! But it\u2019s not because obviously that wouldn\u2019t work. You have to know who you\u2019re lending to to guarantee they\u2019ll pay you back, or take full collateral up front. \n\nWill it get there? Maybe, I never want to be cynical about human potential. But for now it is a budding technology exploring a well know space. \n\nSo that\u2019s to say, anytime you see high yield guarantees run away. Because there is counterparty risk there and it\u2019s gotta be massive.",

People also forget that as easy as it was to just give someone 10,000 Bitcoins to deliver pizzas to you, equally easy was to mine those 10,000 Bitcoins.

Any trader worth their wait it tactfully taking profits anywhere within a 10-20% margin within ATHs. You sell high, wait for the downtrend and DCA back in. This is how the average person who doesn\u2019t have a bunch of capital to throw around can substantially increase their position. \u201cTiming the market\u201d is absolute crucified in here but on a macro level it\u2019s really not that hard. If your blue chip is approaching ATH, take profits. If you\u2019re worried that bull cycle will be the one that truly takes off, only take 50% profits or whatever your risk tolerance is. Crypto is cyclical, and it\u2019s sad to me that the average Joe is just preaching DCAing for a decade + without taking profits when the time calls for it. Take profits, stake in stable coins, wait for the price to get back to an entry point you feel comfortable with, and start DCAing back in. Do what you prefer, but I prefer not to just let my BTC or ETH push to ATH, pump my fist, and watch it go down again and wait a year for the next run up. Too often I see the reason for avoiding this as \u201cnot feeling like doing taxes\u201d and simplifying everything. By not taking profits when the price is booming, we\u2019re letting all the hedge funds and firms take all the goods while we bag hold waiting for half a mil BTC.

Let's say there are ETH for 3k at dex a, and ETH for 3.3k at dex b. You can loan 3k USDC, buy the ETH on dex a, sell them on dex b, pay back the 3k USDC and take the $300 profit, all in the same block without ever having to own ETH. The platform will get the flashloan fee (Aave takes 0.09% IIRC), which will get distributed to the people lending out their USDC, and both dexes involved gets their price closer to the 'real' price of ETH, so it's a win for everybody involved.\n\nHowever, shady (or just incompetent) smallcap protocols will sometimes not use a good oracle, but use some random junk source for their price feed. And that price feed may get wrecked. \n\nLet's say they use the price of ETH on dex a for their price feed. Now the arbitrage trader can actually lend 1 billion worth of ETH, drive the price on the dex down to $0.01, destroy whatever the protocol was using the price feed of ETH for, swap it back on the same dex so the price will still be the same there afterwards, but the protocol using the price feed got absolutely wrecked.

You can't eat it, or live in it. It has value because other people think that company will produce profits and are willing to pay for it. They have value because people value them.\n\nDoes gold have intrinsic value? You can melt it down and make stuff out of it, like gold fillings and jewelry. But why are those things valuable? Because people want them and are willing to pay for them. They have value because people value them.\n\nHow about wheat, berries or meat? Well you need food to live, so surely that has intrinsic value! But if there were no people around to eat it, would it have value? \n\nWould anything have value of there were no human beings around to trade those things? I think the answer is no. \n\nTherefore, things only have value if people ate willing to pay for them. In other words, they have value if people value them.\n\nSo does crypto have value? Yes.

People like to have a set of rules that they apply to everything but two rules is better.\n\nPortfolio 1: this one should be almost solely BTC and ETH. It should be maybe 70-80% of your total crypto net worth. You can DCA and the plan is to hold for the foreseeable future. Some projects that I like particularly can become a Portfolio 1 project but that\u2019s rare and I usually still don\u2019t DCA into them beyond the initial investment, just hold. Think of this portfolio like a retirement fund, just DCA and keep it there.\n\nPortfolio 2: this is where every other project goes. I never ever DCA into these, I buy a chunk (usually the same set amount, $200 at most) and then keep the occasional eye on the price. Sometimes I sell the entire bag, trade a part of it for other projects, etc. This portfolio is more active, you enter projects that seem promising, but you have to manage it as opposed to the first.\n\nBut my point is, not all cryptocurrencies are the same so it\u2019s silly to treat them all the same.",

You are absolutely right, some coins will only bounce for a day or two and then recommence their downtrend once again. I never allocate more than 5% of my stack to a single trade. And I rarely take more than 4 trades from a single day of signals.\n\nI suggested futures funding as one of the reasons to filter out some coins over others. Usually excessively short premium implies a lot of shorts (who need to buy to exit). Check MAPS and other SOL eco coins for an example of excellent buys from oversold conditions.\n\nI didn't mention exit strategies because it's a personal choice but I have already written several times about how I [exit the market using this screener](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tax1vr/how_i_exit_the_crypto_markets_profitably/).

It's a screener it's not a timer. You still have to choose which coin from the list works for you. What are the odds that everyone who uses the screener picks the same coins? Happy to entertain your doubts as long as you wish.\n\nAnd with regards to my profitablity, I can assure you I am doing very well.

                    "response": "Nervos is a multi layered platform, which means users or developers may use higher levels (L2, L3) if less expensive solutions are needed. Nervos doesn't promote a one size fits all approach. Instead it has a range of solutions. L1 has a very specific purpose (it's not designed for storing trivial things).\n\nThe core tokenomics of the L1 base layer tend towards token scarcity (e.g emission halvings, live cells take CKB out of circulation). CKB represents owning state on the blockchain. This CKB is fully redeemable once you decide to stop deploying on L1.\n\nL1 is supposed to become expensive over time and designed to store increasingly higher value assets. This has a few benefits:\n\n1. The native L1 token, CKB, captures the entire value of the L1 base layer and disincentivizes inefficient code and low value asset storage through a mechanism of state rent. It is after all designed to be a global settlement layer. This approach counteracts state bloat.\n\n2. When buying CKB becomes too expensive for a developer wanting to deploy on L1, it will be possible for users to rent/loan out CKB. This will allow passive income and further reinforces the idea of CKB as 'digital real estate'. For a project to deploy on L1 rather than L2 or L3, it would need to be very valuable or have the prospect of becoming very valuable.\n\n3. Only the smart contract needs to remain on chain whilst other aspects can remain off chain. Let's say a standard smart contract size is 36KB and CKB is $1. That would mean $36k is needed to buy the CKB needed to deploy on L1. Dev teams can usually source that kind of funding if the project is innovative. If the project fails or is no longer needed, that CKB is returned in full.",

Part of the goal is to create bridfes to existing dApps that already have the majority of their operational fees covered by their native tokens. The CKB cost for cross chain use is negligible for an established dApp on an existing L1/L2.\n\nThis is at least my own understanding, feel free to add to/correct/poke at my addendum.",

So it doesn't sound more ponzi-ish than the whole crypto ecosystem in general.\n\n---\n\nConsidering \"bank run\" scenario - it is indeed possible, and not only UST, but all decentralized stablecoins, including DAI, are subject. Luna has this meme that it is backed not by luna value, but by the \"value of the ecosystem\" (and they are quite serious about it in a sense that they have a popular payment app and that kind of gives UST inherent medium-of-exchange value).\n\nBut DAI, for example, is also mostly backed by ethereum, and, henceforth, \"value of ethereum ecosystem\".\n\nThe problem is the same with both of these systems: if the underlying collateral is overvalued and suddenly corrects (say, collective public perception of value of ethereum gone 0.1x due to some catastrophic black swan event), the arbitrage mechanism might not be fast enough to destroy stablecoins - and there will be too many.\n\nLuna has the same problem exactly - yes, they have arbitrage mechanism which allows to burn Terra and get more Luna (valued in dollars), and they have a reliable oracle, but this mechanism is rate limited (exactly to prevent uncontrolled minting and death spiral similar to IRON-TITAN story). Basically, that means that it can not crash in normal market conditions (but can dip, we've seen UST dip to 0.8 in one of the prev. year crashes, I think in May), but in case of some really drastic re-evaluation it can become unbacked.\n\nSimilar thing can, indeed, happen to DAI (which is over-collateralized so it is much harder to imagine, but still, a lot of DAI is locked in some smart-contracts and might not be even available for arbitrage, I believe).\n\nSo my judgment: not a Ponzi, but risky indeed. Reward also might be high, but it depends on a lot of factors (like outcome of \"great stablecoin war\", and also general adoption of UST as payment rails).",

Reasons that UST either no longer needs to be concerned about or never shared. Stable offerings like Iron relied recursive holding incentives for growth. This meant If you held the algo stable coin, you would automatically build your stable coin holdings. This was unsustainable and it led a feedback loop of capital flight simultaneously shrinking the value of the stable coin and its holding yield. This increased principal risk and lowered compensating returns.\n\nAs Iron and similar projects were too new for any economic foothold this death spiral of capital was too much to sustain the peg. In short, it was a shit coin driven by speculation with no real use and the speculation was too heavy for the peg to bear. The team incorrectly assumed their algo mechanisms were more important then their stable coin's economic use case.\n\nUST was smarter in the early stages by securing both uncorrelated and correlated economic uses that created a strong foothold. Services like Chai created a base of new UST users that had no clue how to use DeFI or what it even was. As time has passed, UST is now seen as a way to protect the entire DeFI industry from centrally controlled stable coins like USDC/USDT or more decentralized coins like DAI that still leverage the centralized coins previously mentioned. This is the same industry that was originally built on Tether. A stable coin backed by fairy dust, and yet it has held up its peg very well.\n\nAs UST has matured. it has become more resilient. UST is now secured by reserves of Bitcoin and even other alts. In the event of an unpeg under 98 cents, UST holders will have the option to exchange UST for Bitcoin/alts at a 2 cent loss. This helps to alleviate the pressures of a \"death spiral\" as holders will no longer need to be funneled back into Luna in the event of a fear driven sell off. The use of Bitcoin as a reserve asset and additional safety mechanism should be enough for even the largest UST doubters to feel more secure.\n\nIt's pretty clear UST is not going anywhere. The DeFI industry can not continue to be built on stable coins that can be frozen by corporations or the governments that oversee them. Developers already understand this and it is exactly why UST adoption has been sweeping through DeFI. We now have Curve's massive 4pool liquidity and UST bleeding into many ecosystems across multiple chains. UST is no longer as risky as it was during our markets largest crashes, and a much more immature UST already survived those.",

What I meant is that it doesn't explain why I should believe their assumptions will hold true.\n\nPlease note the following excerpts from the article:\n\n>We can see one of the chinks in the armor is that the deposit amount that the Anchor protocol has to pay interest on has been growing at multiples faster than the borrowings that they can earn income with. This widening gap negatively pressures the interest that can be paid to depositors.\n\nand\n\n>Why would anyone borrow against their crypto holdings instead of just selling them outright? This comes back to the 10,000 BTC pizza argument where those who HODL crypto don\u2019t want to sell and miss out on further gains, but they want to be able to use some of the money today.\n\nThese two paragraphs literally make up half of that \"entire page worth\" explaining how money is made. Do you find that satisfactory? It literally says that a) The business model entirely relies on people wanting to borrow against their crypto holdings, and b) there are many people trying to make money by staking, and few who want to take loans - so their business model isn't going to work once the reserves are cleared. Combine that with the very last paragraph, and go figure.\n\n>A lack of understanding something doesnt equate to a ponzi scheme.\n\nYes, but if you fail to explain how revenue is being generated, then that's actually pretty suspicious.

Butbhere you go\n\n\n>The average loan to value (LTV) ratio on the Anchor protocol is about 47% currently and the maximum leverage allowed is 60%.\nThe Luna staking return fluctuates pretty regularly, but it is currently earning around 9.5% a year, and bonded Ethereum is earning a 4.6% rate through their partner Lido.\n\nBut based on your last link, it sounds like you really just came to a cryptocurrency enthusiatst sub to try to convince enthusiast that what theyre into is a bad thing.  Kind of odd but do you.  It doesnt like we're objectively going to agree about much because you've kind of already made up your mind on the subject.\n\nHowever, i took a quick lool at the link you posted.  It's a LONG one so i'm going to have to give it a more proper read later.  But from a quick runthrough, i can talk about the main argument the OP makes.\n\nThe definition of a ponzi:\n\n>1. A scheme where the primary source of money comes from recruiting new people\n\nWhile this is definitely an indicator of a ponzi BTC generates income via market demand.  I'll not even talk about stocks, since OP decided to strengthen his/her argument by immediately trying to void a counter argument that weakens his/her arguments of btc being similar to stocks.  Let's discuss basic economic concepts of supply and demand.  If people start buying up all of the cheetos (or whatever specific item you want to use), the cost to supply cheetos goes up because the demand goes up.  What was originally let's say $1 for a bag could go up to $3 per bag because of demand.  The same thing applies to BTC.  It's price is driven by demand and  people are making money by having an assets who's price is increasing due to demand.  If someone buys BTC, the fiat or whatever they used to buy it doesn't go to another btc holder.\nAnother example is the price of energy in europe increasing dramatically due to supply issues caused by russia's bullshit.  Does that make buying electricity a ponzi scheme? No.  So i dont see how this argument holds unless you just flat out have a misunderstanding of how btc works.\n\n\n >2. A scheme where people who buy in earlier, get paid from people who buy in later.\n\nThis is called being an early investor and is applicable to many other scenarios, ponzis schemes and non-ponzis schemes alike.  People like to compare btc to the great tulip craze.  Was that situation a ponzi scheme creatr by the big tulip corporations? No.  It was market driven demand (weird how that keeps coming up) and those who had tulips before demand rose made more than those who showed up later.  But, again, this argument is a fallacy because it hinges entirely on the idea that the money or crypto a new buyer of btc uses to buy btc goes to someone who bought earlier.  We established that's not how btc works so this argument doesnt hold.\n\n> 3. A scheme that involves misleading the people who are buying into the scheme \n\nThis is definitely a red flag for a ponzi scheme but doesnt apply to btc.  There is some confusion on OP's part and a lot of people outside of the community due to a lack of understanding the history of btc itself.  While, yes, it was at one point trying to be an exchange of value lile a currency, this is no longer the case.  There are a number of btc forks that focus more on thisbapplication but the btc community has decided to focus on store value applicatuon.  Also i think there's a bit of a disconnect by the fact that btc is called a cryptocurrency.  Understandably, this can cause confusion about whether or not btc is a currency if you arent aware that the term cryptocurrency really refers to a categpry of assets that use cryptographic methods (i.e. blockchain) to record their data records.  The word cryptocurrency doesnt really describe an asset that is trying to be a day-to-day tradeable currency.\n\n> 4. A scheme that requires constant recruitment of new buyers in order to sustain itself\n\nThis goes back to the previously discussed supply and demand situation.  I understand that this is just one of a list of thing to look for when identifying a ponzi scheme but this one argument by itself applies to a lot of non-ponzi schemes.\n\n >5. A scheme that naturally collapses when either too many early buyers try to exit/cash out, or the income from new buyers dries up and the scheme is exposed.\n\nThis also goes back to supply and demand and the misunderstanding of how the price of btc fluctuates.  Again, this argument by itself can apply to the stupid cheeto and real world electeicity examples I mentioned earlier.  If you think those are ponzi schemes, well idk what to say really.\n\nAnd i'll hit OP's bonus red flag that he/sge threw in there because apparently btc stole his/her lunch money at some point\n\n>6. A scheme that is often ignored as being a scam as long as it continues operating and paying off people. It's not acknowledged as a Ponzi until a significant portion of investors lose their money\n\nAgain, this argument for btc being a ponzi scheme relies on that fundamental misunderstanding of how btc's. price movement works.",

If you believe that's true, then yeah, UST could be in very serious jeopardy and a bank run could occur as the interest rate is reduced and yield chasers move elsewhere and more copy-cats crop up. \n\nBut UST also has a lot of more organic buildout (in so far as anything in DeFi is organic). There were billions of Terra stable coins in demand before Anchor was even released, and now UST has basically become the de facto stable coin for the entire Cosmos ecosystem and exported to several other blockchains. Not to mention the emergence of real-world payment cards in Korea, Vietnam, the US, etc.\n\nI have 5 figures in UST and only about $500 in Anchor via the White Whale and Pylon. There are more productive uses for it.",

This means UST price must go up. However, the Terra blockchain sees this and locks the staked LUNA in and prints more UST. This increased supply of UST cancels out any additional buy pressure and UST remains $1.\n\n2) When the opposite of 1) happens, i.e. people selling UST to buy crypto, the staked UST is locked and staked LUNA is introduced in the supply. This decreases UST supply and it remains at $1.\n\nWhat's happening now is essentially 1). People selling crypto for UST instead of fiat or USDT using CEFI and DEFi exchanges meaning more UST must be introduced to maintain peg. This means staked LUNA is taken away from supply. This causes LUNA price to spike. This results in FOMO and people staright up buy LUNA, further increasing its price.\n\nNow, when/if 2) happens, and people start seling UST to buy other cryptos, hell will break loose for LUNA. To maintain peg, LUNA will have to be mass printed to decrease UST supply to maintain peg.\n\nThe real question is, during this rapid UST adoption phase, we are seeing 1) happen. But will there be a mass UST selling to buy crypto? Or, after UST widescale adoption, will UST buy/sell pressure remain mostly the same?\n\nTo somewhat combat this, the LUNA devs bought a shit tonne of Bitcoin as collateral but I am not too sure how that all works.\n\nIf you still don't get how UST peg works, give this a read [https://www.crypticinvestor.com/2022/01/the-brilliant-algorithm-behind-terrausd.html](https://www.crypticinvestor.com/2022/01/the-brilliant-algorithm-behind-terrausd.html)",

That is the relationship between them that makes UsT a decentralized stablecoin. You can go on terrastation and see for yourself how your Luna is burned when you want UsT. \n\nHow is the peg maintained? Through arbitrage - this is the key word which is missing. 1 UsT will always equal 1 dollar worth of Luna. For example, if UsT slips to 0.98, arbitrageurs can buy UsT at 0.98 and exchange for Luna at 1 dollar. This buy pressure makes UsT go back up and it is sealed when exchanged for Luna as the UsT is burned. \n\nIf UsT is at 1.01, people can buy one dollar worth of Luna and exchange for 1.01 UsT. The Luna is burned. Arbitrageurs will then sell their UsT, decreasing the price.\n\nThe risk is massive outflows or inflows of UST to the point where arbitrageurs cannot keep up. Therefore, instead of redeeming UsT for Luna or viceversa, Terra will start offering btc to be redeemed. But SOLELY under the conditions that arbitrageurs cannot keep up which will probably never occur unless everything goes properly to shit - something more severe than a typical crash. During crashes, people sell their crypto into stablecoins so people would not sell their UsT (this is theoretical and my opinion though).",

Add to that staking rewards, for example there was a post here previously showing Charles hoskinson earning around $40million/year from staking rewards alone on the coins he allocated to himself. \n\nEven some PoW cryptos would premine a large portion of their supply to sell to the public via an ICO sale, Ethereum for example. This essentially classifies a coin as a security and comes with regulatory risk. \nBack in the day people would instantly label premined cryptos as shitcoins, now it's just standard practice. \n\nFor lunas case, that $10B that is intended to buy Bitcoin reserves comes from investors money ofc, but it's better used on propping up Luna and it's tokens than in Do Kwons pocket. The problem with all coins that arent PoW is not just centralization risk, but also that they cost nothing to produce and with no production costs there is essentially no floor. \n\nIn the case of stable coins if they lose their peg to fiat they are over, so makes a lot of sense to back them with Bitcoin.",

It then creates the perception that it's acceptable to say something is FUD and no further explanation is required. \n\n\nNotice next time that you see something called FUD, the question it was in response to. Often times people have taken time to ask nuanced questions about some underlying issue that they are concerned about (pick your project) and they are just piled on with aligations of FUD. \n\nThe problem with this is it actually allows bad actors in the crypto space to continue on unchecked and we often see this type of blind behaviour play out leading into rugpulls. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I see plenty of times where holders don't have 2 brain cells to rub together and they start needlessly panicing because they have jumped to some conclusion in their minds and then they start posting real FUD.... But even in those cases, the correct response is to always reply in a nuanced way and explain to them and the wider community why/how they are wrong. This allows a project the opportunity to once again get people back \"on brand\". \n\nProjects that always take the easy out and just declare \"FUD\" and then ignore it ALWAYS turn off new investors because it just demonstrates a complete lack of transparency and a lack of drive to improve. It's a tatic used to shore up support of the existing community and stop them questioning in a lot of cases, VERY ligitimate concerns! \n\nI'd actually love to see a way to track how much alligations of FUD happen in community social media and the eventual outcome of projects.... I'd bet there is a real link between declaring FUD against everyone in the community who asks questions and the project being a rugpull/scam in some way.... \n\nCould that be automated to scrape the data from social media channels and then calculate a weighted average based on community size to give a usable number to compare over differant projects? \n\nBe pretty cool to have a tool that at a glance showed \"head stuck in the sand\" score of 50 and above = be very wary of a potential scam/rugpull.... It's not going to predict anything, but it would be a tool to warn investors to be hyper aware that there are systemic communication/transparency problems in those projects.",

He even picks up on the safemoon wallet being a clone of Trust Wallet which in itself isn't fishy as it's open source and anyone is able to re-use the code at will.\n\nIf this was a video from Coin Bureau I'd be more inclined to believe it wasn't biased but apparently he also worked with redditor TNGSystems who has been farming moons with posts about Safemoon for a long time now.\n\nI was invested in Safemoon and made about 8K profit but we need more level headed people looking at this stuff not people who seem to want the clicks.\n\nLastly, billion dollar fraud? Is this supposed to mean they've made a billion dollars out of it somehow? Nothing in the video comes close to even hinting at such a large sum.",

But the $15m was a one time payment. So unless if everyone on the exchange stopped trading SM or the exchange is not holding their end of the deal. This means that wasn't for LP\n\nHe even uses the FBI investigation as a \"look, they did something wrong\" but the FBI said a while back for what they were investigating for they didn't. And something to note, an investigation means nothing. Investigations happen ALL the time and nothing comes from many of them. Like an investigation could be simply something like the FBI or cops call up, asked a question, and that is it. It isn't like the movies where you have a swat team or some unmarked van outside. That crap cost money\n\nAnd then there is videos that have been coming out of people who he took out of context or interviewed. Like some of the unedited videos shows he was trying to get people into a trap or paint them in a way. Some of the interviews he didn't use because some didn't fall for the trap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is one of those where you can save the world 9 times over and do great things. But 1 bad thing will now be what everything thinks about when they think of you. Expect, in this case there is a ton of problems that are overshadowing the actual problems.\n\nHe should've sticked with the facts instead of speculating, getting simple math wrong, and trying to trap people in interviews. If he just stuck to the facts, then there would be no defending since SM holders were turning on the coin before all these problems in the video started to be found.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhell, on the bottom of the video there is even a disclaimer stating that nothing in this video were facts with actual evidence, but speculation.

You can look at all the transactions going through btc, the supply being generated, and verify that everything is working as intended.\n\nMonero is the most private coin.

Keep in mind that for most investments a 10% annual return would be in 'check that it's not a scam' territory, but if a person or company can afford to have their money sit for 6 months then as long as they can sell from about 45-48k somewhere in there they've hit a roughly 20% annual roi even if the price crashes again two days later.",

Look at the limits.\n\nEach exchange has a given amount of liquidity. \n\nSo if you are stupid, you would try to sell all in one place at once and maybe lose 20% of the value or more due to liquidity. And then take the fiat out all at once from one place, and maybe get it locked up in limbo for a solid month or so.\n\n# Here is what you should do\n\n# Step 1\n\nFigure out how much money you're worth, and where is your off ramps for that coin. Then split them up in several off ramps based on the limits. Try to go 20% below the limits because some off ramps are stupid.\n\n# Step 2\n\nWARN THE OFF RAMP ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING. In you are in a binance US situation. Good luck on that. Swap to another crypto like ALGO and send it to something like Kraken that is worth a damn. Like you can notify Binance US, but their current customer support might not get back to you in 3 years, and the best you will get is a copy paste answer to a question you never asked.\n\n# Step 3\n\nWARN THE BANK. This lets them know they are about to get a bit of money and for them to not lock it up. Or at least be ready to unlock it pretty quickly and maybe you can ask them for advice.\n\n# Step 4\n\nStart selling. Part of the reason for warning the exchange is so they would give you a heads up on how to go about this. Like can their system stand you dumping $500k, or do you need to baby step it. On the off chance they are an idiot or lied, personally I could sell $20k every 15 to 30 min. Watch to see if the price really dumps, and then stop when that happens.\n\nSee, what you are doing is looking to see if the liquidity is really there. Lets say you are on exchange A and doing this and exchange B you aren't. Watch both charts and if you see the price just drop in exchange A, you are going beyond what their liquidity will allow. Your choices is to wait long and/or sell less per time. Or try another off ramp.\n\n(Most BTW sell $45K per go per hour)\n\n# Step 5\n\nPull whatever amount out. Hopefully your bank isn't an idiot, and hopefully the exchange isn't an idiot. Don't go  to the limit because most exchange will \"screw up\" in locking the transaction because they might not have the money or because they really did screw up. This is also a major reason for step 2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 6\n\nGo cry in the corner because after all of that, you now owe the IRS half of that.",

I know the team and they are doxxed (supposedly, people can lie) and where the money comes from makes sense and the returns are high but reasonable given the circumstances. Additionally everyone I've spoke to about it has nothing but good things to say and the rproject is about 4 years old. I still can't but worry since I have no protection if they exit scam so I will just have my small amount in and on break even  I will \"play with the houses money\". \n\nScared money don't make money.",

                    "response": "Oh Look.  Someone heard about a \"lending platform in crypto\", did ZERO research into how they actually work, and took a boomer approach to scaring people away from them.\n\nSo, how legitimate borrowing/lending platforms generally work is just how many bank loans work (like your house note).  There is a borrower who pays interest and a lender to gets that interest.  OH, but what about that risk?  Well, in many platforms, just like in real life banking, there is collateral.  The borrower has to \"lock up\" THEIR OWN crypto of value (often BTC which is very solid value for the lowest rates) to borrow AGAINST that.  It's called collateralization.  The amount loaned can be a % of that collateral up to usually 80-90% for higher quality collateral, and lower for riskier collateral (re more volatile crypto).\n\nSo Scenario 1:  Borrower pays back loan with interest, and the collateral is released, the lender gets the interest and their own lended tokens back.\n\nScenario 2:  Borrower fails to pay back the loan, OR the borrower's collateral drops below the threshold, and that is liquidated and given to the lender.  The borrower lost the collateral, and the lender is made whole.\n\nSmart contracts prevent A) The borrower from simply taking back their collateral before servicing the loan and B) The lender from liquidating the borrowers collateral whenever they choose because it might be worth more than was lended out.\n\nSO....Instead of a BANK (because we know how wonderfully honest and respectable those lending institutions are wed to Wall st.) doing this process for you and taking their cut, the borrower and lender essentially use technology and the blockchain to deal directly with each other, no application fees, no KYC, no funny business.\n\nYeah, it's deregulated, but if you took the time to research a good lending platform, you would realize that the REGULATED lending system has caused immensely more pain and suffering to borrowers than defi could if designed properly.\n\nAlso, the \"platform going bankrupt\" is a clear misunderstanding of how defi works.  It is NOT a \"company somewhere\" with your money in a bank account.  It is a protocol utilizing a blockchain to execute smart contracts.  There is no office building somewhere and a bank account that the deposits go into.  That's not how defi works.  And because of this, it cannot go \"bankrupt\".  Yes, value of the tokens held/loaned/borrowed can change, but that is true even if you simply buy and hold any crypto tokens.  The protocol could be nefarious and a scam to simply steal your tokens, but that is true of any institution dealing with money, and due diligence is equally important in defi as it is in traditional finance.\n\nHope this helps someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  After re-reading the original post, and some of the responses, it seems like you guys are talking potentially about leaving your coins on a CEX for % return from the CEX.  Or maybe even staking or using a DEX for LP'ing.  This is NOT \"lending\" as it relates to Defi and I felt the spirit of the OP's post was talking about borrowing/lending protocols in Defi.  Sorry.",
