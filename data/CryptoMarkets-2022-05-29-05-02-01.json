And we\u2019re already starting to see some projects surfacing that are giving people the option to monetize their data kinda like what Ocean Protocol has been doing recently. Although they\u2019ve only been doing this for scientific related purposes but I believe that this could easily be expanded.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder than these major companies are starting to tao into the crypto market. At first they actually fought crypto but quickly realized that they cant stop it. And you that famous saying \u201cif you cant beat em, join em\u201d",

No one will like to pay for an hotel and the transaction left visible to anyone willing to track it on the blockchain. The issue of privacy will be amplified once crypto goes mainstream and are considered for use as payment options. It'll be absolutely ridiculous to pay for a coffee or drink through crypto and because of that, the bartender can estimate buyers' wallet balance as a result. More reasons why Railgun might turn out to be a big deal if by any chance, privacy becomes a requirement while interacting with smart contracts.",

Zero knowledge proofs are not just limited to anonymizing users experience, they are being actively explored in introducing privacy in decentralized finance.

Also, Zero knowledge proofs are evidently crucial in the set up of the widely accepted privacy coin, Monero. Indeed, ZK proofs is already playing crucial roles.",
