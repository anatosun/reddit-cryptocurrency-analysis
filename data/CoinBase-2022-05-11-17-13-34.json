It ridicules me that coinbase will not help only saying that it does not support wormhole luna and only supports wrapped luna/ UST. \n\nThis makes no sense because the receiving address is an ERC-20 wallet (coinbase's wallet) and now has my wormhole LUNA. My LUNA just didnt disappear, it simply went to their wallet. Terra will be depricating the old wrapped version but they have so many issues on their own.\n\nI just hope coinbase can recover my funds with a small fee (binance does that) or add wormhole UST/Luna. I'm sure there's millions lost in transaction with this wormhole.\n\nCan people help me by upvoting or comment below if you have similar issues. Please help!",

It doesn't make any sense to blame Coinbase for it; because Luna doesn't have an address on Coinbase.\n\nAnd Coinbase wanted to have Luna, but the Luna people didn't want to share the necessary information for Luna like they provided for their UST, to be listed on the exchange. So we got basically the worthless Wrapped version. \n\nThe ball is still in Luna's court to be listed. But even Luna getting listed, you didn't send to a Luna address so you \"should not\" get those coins anyway. Because \"sending non-Wrapped Luna to this address can result in the permanent loss of the coins\".",

I know I've done it many times as recently as a few weeks ago. \n\nI stored on anchor, used the terra bridge, sent to my metamask wallet, then to an exchange - coinbase in this example. The process always worked beautifully. \n\nI used this process last night, as did many others, and it didn't work bc something changed on the back end of the bridge that suddenly resulted in us unknowingly getting UST (wormhole) out of the bridge rather than the other erc20 UST version supported by coinbase. Honest mistake anyone could make.\n\nCoinbase could assist by supporting the asset or by releasing the funds back to the wallet we sent from. Binance and other exchanges do this for their customers. I don't think expecting support from coinbase is unreasonable here.",

There are a number of failings on the part of Coinbase here. \n\n1) Coinbase does not actually support TerraUSD (UST) as it claims. Coinbase supports what is commonly referred to as \u2018Wrapped UST\u2019 which is not UST, but rather a separate ERC-20 token that\u2019s designed to track UST\u2019s value. This token is also known as \u2018UST (Shuttle)\u2019 and has the official ticker wUST (assigned to it by the issuers of the asset, Terra).\n\n2) In a Medium blog post that was released by Terra on October 19th 2021, it was stated that the Shuttle-bridged versions of UST and LUNA (that are to be phased out) have the tickers wUST and wLUNA and that the Wormhole-bridged versions have the official tickers of USTw and LUNAw. Coinbase has not used these tickers that could have safeguarded their customers against transferring assets which are unsupported. The blog also states that exchanges have been notified, so the fact that Coinbase has not acted to prevent this now widespread issue in the past 7 months is totally unacceptable.\n\n3) Other leading exchanges such as FTX and KuCoin give an explicit warning about which versions of UST on the Ethereum network they support. There is no excuse for coinbase not to have done the same.",

If anyone's crypto holdings got touched before they laid off maybe down to 200 employees, the entire company is dead. They have 5000 employees, as as someone who has tried to work with crypto exchanges in partnerships, almost all of the employees are burnt the fuck out and don't have enough support.\n\nLet's say they lay of 2,500 employees and each of those employees is earning $200k.  That saves them $500 million dollars.  What about the other $1 billion dollars they burned through in Q1?\n\nAnd yes, layoffs would happen before a bankruptcy, they always do.  But layoffs won't fix their cash burn problem.  Also, Coinbase wouldn't \"touch\" cypto holdings.  That is not how bankruptcy works. The courts would handle it and those who held unsecured debt, which Coinbase has stated all of their crypto holdings are, would get almost nothing.\n\nYou are correct, that this is a worse case scenario.  But bankruptcies happen.  No one knows how long this bear market will last.  But the fact that Coinbase's crypto holding are unsecured should absolutely worry anyone who has their crypto in Coinbase.",

You had the opportunity to get out in front of this wave of negativity before it became a tsunami of misinformation, but instead your \"mods\" sat in the corner short-stroking it to pictures of Bored Apes.  Whomever you're paying to do this should be shot and pissed on.\n\nFor the idiots who take this as a sign that CB is going to go belly up: move your coins off the exchange.  Simple.  However, each and every exchange has the same potential fatal flaw whether they declare it or not -- not your keys, not your crypto.  If this is bothersome to you, then move your coins to your own wallet and be done with it.  Otherwise, there's always a risk that you'll get caught up in MtGox 2.0.\n\nCan't move your ETH off because you locked stake into 2.0?  Tough shit.  That was part and parcel of the agreement you signed (or check-boxed) when committing to the stake.  Don't like it?  Maybe you should have read the agreements and disclosures, eh?  Shit sucks, but maybe you'll learn from the experience and think twice before doing it again. \n\nSick and fucking tired of noisy fucking idiots.",

If they liquidated today and paid all creditors, the company would still have a book value of 6b. Current trading price even after todays action is a 12b market cap. They posted a 430mm q1 loss after posting 800m profits in q4. They could withstand multiple (10-12+) quarters with losses like this and be far from bankruptcy unless they did something absolutely wild like borrow an insane amount of money for bad acquisitions. Given their long standing track record and having to answer to shareholders after a rough quarter, I doubt they would do it.\n\nThey stated in their report that they hold 256 billion for retail customers. 10 billion of that actually shows up as a liability on their balance sheet. I imagine those are the custody customers that would be further ahead in line than the retail folks.  Can someone also give some insight on this ?  Even if the company had more liabilities than assets, and had to draw  from the 256b in retail holdings during a bankruptcy event\u2026 wouldn\u2019t they only be able to take a small fraction of that as 256b far exceeds their total value as a company ??",
