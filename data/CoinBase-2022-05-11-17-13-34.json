It ridicules me that coinbase will not help only saying that it does not support wormhole luna and only supports wrapped luna/ UST. \n\nThis makes no sense because the receiving address is an ERC-20 wallet (coinbase's wallet) and now has my wormhole LUNA. My LUNA just didnt disappear, it simply went to their wallet. Terra will be depricating the old wrapped version but they have so many issues on their own.\n\nI just hope coinbase can recover my funds with a small fee (binance does that) or add wormhole UST/Luna. I'm sure there's millions lost in transaction with this wormhole.\n\nCan people help me by upvoting or comment below if you have similar issues. Please help!",
