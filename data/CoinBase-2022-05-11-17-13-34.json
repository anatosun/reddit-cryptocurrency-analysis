If Coinbase declares bankruptcy, the crypto users bought is unsecured debt, which means that you will literally get pennies on the dollar for your crypto held in Coinbase.  Plus it will take years in bankruptcy court to see those pennies.\n\nSo in non-lawyer speak: if Coinbase declarers bankruptcy and you own $20,000 in cypto through Coinbase at the time of their filing, your Coinbase holdings will suddenly become inaccessible to you and will probably get $200-$500 dollars for your $20,000 in crypto 1-2 years after their bankruptcy filing.",

Coinbase burned through $1.5 billion dollars of cash during the first quarter alone.  I'm old enough to remember the dot-com bubble bursting.  There were all of these trendy tech companies that were unprofitable and were burning through cash at a very high rate, but had huge valuations based on \"growth\".  Then the economy downturned, the fed raised interest rates several times and large percentage of these companies stopped paying their employees and went bankrupt.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com\\_bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble)\n\n>If I'm Brian Armstrong and the crypto bear market turns into a long hard as hell winter, do the grim task of laying off 50% of the employees (I would rather hold on to them for the next crypto bull market explosion if possible) but that would cut costs by an insane amount.

They have 5000 employees, as as someone who has tried to work with crypto exchanges in partnerships, almost all of the employees are burnt the fuck out and don't have enough support.\n\nLet's say they lay of 2,500 employees and each of those employees is earning $200k.  That saves them $500 million dollars.  What about the other $1 billion dollars they burned through in Q1?\n\nAnd yes, layoffs would happen before a bankruptcy, they always do.  But layoffs won't fix their cash burn problem.  Also, Coinbase wouldn't \"touch\" cypto holdings.  That is not how bankruptcy works. The courts would handle it and those who held unsecured debt, which Coinbase has stated all of their crypto holdings are, would get almost nothing.\n\nYou are correct, that this is a worse case scenario.  But bankruptcies happen.  No one knows how long this bear market will last.  But the fact that Coinbase's crypto holding are unsecured should absolutely worry anyone who has their crypto in Coinbase.",

Just goes to show that the crypto space is overpopulated by moonbois who don't bother reading any of the shit they're signing up for. \n\nOh, and if CB's abysmal support drones are watching, this is the *exact* situation that I described in my open letter to you (since blocked publicly, and ignored privately) as to why you need an active mod-team, rather than whatever this piss-poor excuse for moderation is.  You had the opportunity to get out in front of this wave of negativity before it became a tsunami of misinformation, but instead your \"mods\" sat in the corner short-stroking it to pictures of Bored Apes.  Whomever you're paying to do this should be shot and pissed on.\n\nFor the idiots who take this as a sign that CB is going to go belly up: move your coins off the exchange.  Simple.  However, each and every exchange has the same potential fatal flaw whether they declare it or not -- not your keys, not your crypto.  If this is bothersome to you, then move your coins to your own wallet and be done with it.  Otherwise, there's always a risk that you'll get caught up in MtGox 2.0.\n\nCan't move your ETH off because you locked stake into 2.0?  Tough shit.  That was part and parcel of the agreement you signed (or check-boxed) when committing to the stake.  Don't like it?  Maybe you should have read the agreements and disclosures, eh?  Shit sucks, but maybe you'll learn from the experience and think twice before doing it again. \n\nSick and fucking tired of noisy fucking idiots.",

It ridicules me that coinbase will not help only saying that it does not support wormhole luna and only supports wrapped luna/ UST. \n\nThis makes no sense because the receiving address is an ERC-20 wallet (coinbase's wallet) and now has my wormhole LUNA. My LUNA just didnt disappear, it simply went to their wallet. Terra will be depricating the old wrapped version but they have so many issues on their own.\n\nI just hope coinbase can recover my funds with a small fee (binance does that) or add wormhole UST/Luna. I'm sure there's millions lost in transaction with this wormhole.\n\nCan people help me by upvoting or comment below if you have similar issues. Please help!",
