            "selftext": "Sooo with the recent stalk market climet and it's effects on crypto, I've been thinking more on looking for signs of a company going bankrupt.. What are they?  Was reading that the crunch on available capital that a company has usually settles on the employees first. First it's no more hiring then layoffs.\n\nAre there any seasoned community members here that have personally seen a company implode and go bankrupt. What was the series of events that took place? Any good indicators?\n\nI would think simply looking at the company's ability to expand or contract would be the first sign. \n\nLooking for seasoned market veterans to chip in. Very keen on the knowledge base from individuals with 15+ years of experience in investing. \n\nI think with the crypto sphere looking how it is now it might be important to know the signs while tracking our favorite coins/tokens.",
