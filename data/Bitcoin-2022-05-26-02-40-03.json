People in third-world countries with high inflation, shitty banking systems, high remittance fees etc, by contrast, are highly incentivised to look for alternatives. I was reading an interview with a Ukrainian crypto guy yesterday (ok not third-world, but same deal), and he said exactly that about the high adoption of crypto in Ukraine even before the war, that the banking system was shot, and the government had a tendency to seize your money if you put it in a bank account, hence people turn to crypto.\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/23138465/decoder-ukraine-war-cryptocurrency-michael-chobanian-interview-bitcoin-usdt",
