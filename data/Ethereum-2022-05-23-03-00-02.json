            "selftext": "Most stories that you will read about the event will focus on the depegging of the mechanism of the algorithmic stablecoin which was tied to the supply and market value of the protocol token. This is interesting, of course, but I don't see too many people discussing the other side effect, the network became so vulnerable to attacks at the consensus level that the Luna Foundation was forced to turn it off. \\[[https://twitter.com/terra\\_money/status/1524935730308456448](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1524935730308456448)\\] Because the proof of stake network derived the security guarantees from the (Dollar) cost of staked Luna, its market price devaluation allowed malicious actors to buy Luna for cheap and attack the network at the consensus level. \n\nI must confess that I was aware of the concerns for the mechanism design of Luna, and knew there was a risk for a death spiral. However, I did not think the risks would play out so spectacularly and meteorically. I also assumed that in normal market conditions, the decisions of the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) to use BTC as their forex reserve would allow the foundation to counteract the risks. It was a declaration of defeat of the algorithmic stable coin system, but I thought it would generally be able to recover from volatile - and natural market conditions. That is because I did not consider the coordinated malicious attack security vector. The fact that the attackers were able to short the market made it profitable to crash the market price of Luna, made me revisit previous assumptions I've had and am less confident in POS as a concept.\n\nOnce the price of Luna crashed the chain became vulnerable for a consensus level attack, which is why it was 'shut down'. This is often overlooked, but I find it to be the most significant revelation about the entire ordeal. To me this seems to indicate there is a systemic risk for a death spiral on EVERY proof of stake network. Yes, even Ethereum, the network that I use daily, and that I chose as the most secure infrastructure to build the platform that I am working on. The core concept of Proof Of Stake is that it is expensive to be a malicious actor. But the expense to attack a proof of stake network is not denominated in value exogenous to the network itself. You stake Ether to secure Ethereum, and thus make the Ether that you need to run computation on that network more valuable. That means that **if the value of Ether goes down, the security of the Ethereum network goes down**. There is a point in which you can effectively use market mechanics to bring the value of Ethtereum low enough to make an attack on the network\u2019s consensus viable, at which point the value of Ether would continue to fall in the same kind of feedback loop that we saw with Luna. Impractical, yes, unrealistic, I don't think so. **The network is valuable because it is expensive to attack it, and it\u2019s expensive to attack it because the unit price of Ether is valuable.** This logic is a bit more circular than I am comfortable with. \n\nHave people addressed this risk in PoS chains directly? I am not too interested in discussing the LUNA thing further, but rather in the consensus level attack that was leveraged once the price tanked. I'd love to hear the community's thoughts on this.",

Of course it was easy to attack the network when the number of staked tokens out of total supply was so minuscule, and no good actors were staking more since the network was dead. This is not really an issue that would appear on Ethereum.",

It's unlikely imo that the chain state would be rolled back to before the hack if one was. Bitcoin has *never* done anything like that. Only Ethereum has, after the DAO hack that led to the creation of Ethereum Classic. Very antithetical to the idea of blockchain and kinda proving the centralization of Etehreum at the time. To this day I consider that a huge black mark on Ethereum.",

Otherwise you can not finalize a block and after you stop the attack the attacker's blocks can just be discarded.\n* There is a queue to onboard and offboard validators. This queue exists to avoid a sudden change in validators. If I remember correctly it would take around two years to acquire 67% of the PoS validators with the current number of validators.\n* Ethereum introduces slashing. This means if anybody tries so propose an invalid block or tries to cheat in the voting process, it takes just one, I repeat, just ONE honest validator to report this and the attacker loses all there ETH.\n* If an attacker has more than 34% and refuses to vote to finalize blocks (more than 66% is required for this), their stake is slowly taken away by the protocol until they have less than the required 32 ETH and will be thrown out as a validator.\n* In an extreme case the core devs can decide to discard malicious blocks if all of the above would not be sufficient. This means that all the clients would release a new version that says that the attacker's blocks are not part of the chain anymore. This would only ever be used in the most extreme attacks, but it is something that is possible with PoS. With PoW you cannot do that, which means that it can not be protected from a hostile takeover, if the attacker has a nearly unlimited amount of capital (= a nation state).  \n\n\nMany people consider the PoS protocol in Ethereum outdated, because it requires locking your ETH and it can be slashed, but what they don't realize is that those are protections against attacks that other PoS protocol simply don't have.",

This means an attacker has to either own a large percentage of the total supply or somehow convince a lot of people to delegate to them (which requires social engineering). In case someone attacks the chain with delegated stake, the community could react by redelegating and therefore taking away the attacker's power.\n\nBoth systems have pros and cons.

On a PoS protocol with built-in slashing an attacker with 51% of the staked coins can perform a double spend but would then be slashed by the protocol. If they want to avoid the slashing they would have to change the protocol which would result in a hard-fork (they would have to change the software and convince the majority of nodes to update to their version). Assuming there's a single entity behind the attack, they most certainly wouldn't control the majority of nodes, so their hard-fork would not be successful.\n\nTL;DR: owning 51% of the staked coins lets you decide which transactions go into a block but it doesn't let you change the protocol.",

Idk if it's harder to get half the coins or half the nodes, but even if the Ethereum market cap fell another 80% it'd still be quite a technical feat to attempt creating majority of nodes without driving up the locked value/security, and thus nearly impossible to have enough supermajority for half the coins to double spend simultaneously. Anything less than a perfect kill shot attack would cause a fork from the attacking nodes and enough slashing from the whale to reduce their majority and reduce supply thus driving up price/security. It's nicely a balanced, self regulating mechanism, so you actually have to buy something greater than 70% of the network to actually attack it iirc (not my math but a protocol dev mentioned this supermajority threshold on a bankless interview, someone go check my number, I think it was prob from Justin Bons or Tom Beiko).\n\nThe economic policy of Ethereum is this much more thoughtfully developed than the PoW system (which does have a potential but unlikely death spiral from an offchain attack vector of a nation owning half the mining power, if a crash should wipe out much decentralization of miners).",

I recall back in the days of the Ethereum/Ethereum Classic fork there were a lot of anti-Classic people raging at the exchanges for listing ETC when they \"should\" be just letting that fork die, and blamed the exchanges for \"supporting\" ETC. Of course it's really the opposite, the only reason the exchanges listed ETC was because there was enough demand for it to make money by facilitating trades. It'd likely be the same for an attack fork on PoS, the exchanges will list whichever ones there's demand for from their users because that's what makes them money.",

Something super unpopular like double spend or mint tokens to themselves or something more in a grey area? Removing funds from hackers, blocking addresses due to \"terrorism\" and other legal reasons? At that point controlling the narrative and public sentiment will be enough to prevent a fork.\n\nYou also have to consider the bigger something becomes the harder it gets to create an alternative, imagine if ETH became huge and used worldwide by a number of companies/countries how feasible would it be to perform an fork on such a scale if the reason weren't compelling enough?",

Bad actors could buy up a fiat currency, then initiate a massive sell-off, resulting in further selling to the point where it essentially collapses. \n\nWhat helps to protect fiat currency from this kind of spiral is the same thing that protects cryptocurrencies.  Demand for the currency, size of the \"market cap\"/value of money supply, utility of the currency (eg can you use it to buy oil without having to exchange it?).  When a currency isn't considered valuable or useful it can have very quick devaluation, as was seen with the ruble recently.  The same things help protect cryptocurrencies from collapsing.\n\nA smaller, weaker currency which is considered to have little utility is vulnerable to this kind of attack.  As long as Ethereum is big, valued and has utility relative to its price, any big sell-offs would be bought up imo just as they would with a country trying to sell tons of usd.",

                    "response": "The value of the coin secures the chain whether it's PoW or PoS. With Bitcoin there's strong precedent that [hashrate correlates with coin price](https://i.redd.it/pjfashii7ou41.png) and it's easy to see why: You can convert all the fiat expenses involved (hardware investment + energy spent mainly) and convert that to Bitcoin. If mining 1 bitcoin costs more than 1 bitcoin, you're effectively buying bitcoin at a higher price than what the market offers. If mining 1 bitcoin costs less than 1 bitcoin, then that's a vacuum attracting hashrates for anyone who doesn't care about bitcoin and just wants to mine and immediately sell. Of course it's more complicated than that and the costs involved are more composite/abstract/amortized/whatever, but that's the gist of it. As long as the cost of mining 1 BTC honestly it smaller than the cost of double-spending 1 BTC, the chain is secure. This might become a problem over time as Bitcoin's issuance drops to 0, you better hope fees catch up to cover it\n\nAll blockchains are susceptible to such a death spiral if they consistently issue more coins than they collect in fees. The exceptional thing with Luna is it basically happened overnight. I don't see this happening to other blockchains anywhere near this fast, in most cases they turn into ghost chains way faster, and then it doesn't matter if it's cheap to attack them if there's no gains to be made from it. And then big money won't want to flow into a chain that's insecure, so there's another catch22-type feedback loop there.\n\nBut yes, this concept is more directly visible with PoS, but can still be mitigated by aiming for economic sustainability, e.g. EIP1559 burning transaction fees and accruing values from the economic activity happening on the blockchain. Coupled with low PoS inflation, when fees > issuance, Ether-the-asset becomes deflationary and kickstarts a bunch of [cool feedback loops](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png) that lead to (among other things) more security for the chain. \n\nIt also helps that Ethereum stakers aren't force sellers (since staking nodes require very little costs), unlike PoW miners who are constantly adding selling pressure on the market, which lowers the price if that selling pressure can't be absorbed by buyers. In his interview on Bankless, Hal Press explains that this is why crypto prices swing the way they do: 2 ETH/block issuance means about 13,000 ETH going to miners, and if you conservatively assume they have to sell half to cover expenses, that's 6500 newly printed ETH every day who have to find buyers just for the price to stay the same. Issuance is denominated in ETH, but buying pressure is denominated in fiat: At $200 per ETH that's not so bad, the market can absorb 1.3 million dollars easily to prevent the price from going down. But if ETH jumps to $5k then suddenly that's $32.5M that needs to be absorbed by buyers every single day, until eventually the speculation dries up and that buying pressure disappears and there's a big crash down to a more sustainable price equilibrium where sales match buys. After the merge, all that selling pressure disappears, but the buying pressure doesn't and suddenly it's the buying pressure that needs to be absorbed by sellers to prevent the price from going up. Draw your own conclusions...\n\nAnd on a more technical level there are other safety nets for PoS Ethereum to protect itself: There's still a limit to how fast someone can deposit Ether to stake. At 12 million ETH staked, you'll need to stake more than 12 million of your own to have 51%. And there's only 1350 new validators that can become active every day. So even if ETH crashes to $1 and $12M to attack is chump change to you, you'll still have to wait 12M ETH \u00f7 32 ETH/validator \u00f7 1350 validators/day = over 9 months before finally having enough stake to attack. Not to mention it's not like there's 12 million ETH in liquidity on the open market waiting to be bought at exactly $1 each lol. And then you attack once and get slashed, and the total supply drops by 12 million ETH and you need another 9 months and another 12 million of now-much-scarcer ETH to do the attack again. Now run that same math for when in 2-3 years there's 30-40 million ETH staked. It'll go to a point where acquiring enough ETH to stake and attack is just not imaginable.",

In the event of a rapid crash in Ether price, it is easier for many small players to begin validating than a single large player. Even with the 32 Ether requirement, there are protocols to allow you to create a validator with only 16 eth.\n\nNot all people jumping in to be validators will be malicious, and the larger the amount of validators, the harder it is to be malicious in the first place. Your validators' votes are compared to other validators, which can all reject your vote, if it violates the rules. The scope of attacks is limited, I believe, to censorship. They still wouldn't be able to \"give\" or \"delete\" ether from someone's account or contract.\n\nBlock producers are separate from validators. Anyone can be a block producer (I think?), validators check that it passes the rules, so the power doesn't inherently lie with the validators. (note I may be off on this assumption).\n\nOverall, the Ethereum PoS is vastly different from Terra's PoS. I don't know the specifics to their consensus, and if any of these were of concern to them, but there are some differences I can already find that don't apply to Ethereum.\n\nThe currency used to create validators in Terra was Luna. Luna was tightly (directly) coupled with UST. I know you question isn't about the unpegging and rapid inflation of Luna, but Ethereum isn't tied algorithmically like this. There can't be an explosive increase in supply like we saw in Terra. It had like 20,000% increase in just a few days, which by itself would be a massive decrease in the cost of a validator, along side the rapidly decrease of the underlying value as well, multiplying the effect.\n\nEther isn't tied to anything, and there's no case that I can think of that would cause Ether to increase in supply by 20,000% overnight. Because of this, a rapid deployment of cheap validators requires a massive influx of capitol, buying out massive supply of Ether, increasing the price, reassuring the security of the chain again.\n\nDepending on the liquidity of Ether, this could be prohibitively expensive. We're talking something on order of 10%-30% of the Total Supply of Ether needing to be purchase and introduced into staking. This is a *massive* cost, not to mention it would take a *long* time to get all of those validators active. At 900 validators per day, only 0.024% of the total supply can be added at a time. 20% of the Total supply would take 2.28 years.\n\nI also like to add, that the tweet saying they're taking the blockchain down for PoS consensus attacks, is just what they claimed was the reason they're haulting it. Who fucking knows the real reason.\n\nSo no, I don't see it as a risk really.",

This way the protocol can strategically abandon points of defense and fall back to another layer before it locks a token in a death spiral.\n\nFor example, at 1 dollar, you can 2 way arbitrage with Arbitrage Luna, and that stops if the Arbitrage coin's market cap drops below the stablecoin or if the stablecoin hits $0.50. At that point, the protocol starts to spend assets in it's liquidity pool to maintain $0.50. Once the liquidity pool is exhausted, the smart contract allows you to swap stablecoins for governance tokens, again as long as the governance token's market cap is above that of the stablecoin.\n\nYou could further stabilize this by adding an airdrop token in the middle. IIRC, Luna had signorage (sp?) fees which were mostly burned. If you gave that to a dedicated airdrop token instead and set it to defend $0.75 as long as it's market cap is above the stablecoin, then you have a pretty well layered protocol defense.",

ETH should look at them as the enemy not their friend. I mean FTX and Binance directly compete with ETH with SOL and BNB, and eth is handing supply control over yo their competitors.",

That is a concern if these centralized entities decide to use the eth they have been given to stake to instead manipulate the market. There should be transparency from centralized entities, showing the transactions of staking validators to be sure funds are used as they say they are being used.\n\nAs discussed a in other comments in this thread, a similar situation to what happened to luna is substantially less likely on eth because:\n\n1. Validators need to wait in a queue to leave or join, so of price drops dramatically, a single entity cannot immediately purchase enough eth then control the network, it would take a long time for that shift to occur.\n\n2. Eth isn't created based on any market or external conditions other than what is issued via the consensus mechanism. For luna as the price of luna decreased, the more would be inflated when cashing out ust, which meant the staked validators had less and less of the total supply/market cap, making controlling the network much cheaper.",

As described above the advantage in rewards for whales is minimal. Assuming no external factors, any edge can compound over time and trend to infinity. This is true for any form of capital, depending on how it is used, the more one has the more potential to grow it proportionally to the amount owned. This is true of pow and pos, and capitalism in general. In your extreme example, yes the 32 validator actors rewards trend to infinity/100%. Issue is that the example is extreme, as it assumes no reward for having under 32 eth, when in reality that could be earning rewards at roughly 85% the rate of a validator (depending on the service +-10%), and with an extreme apy that is many orders of magnitude higher than existing rates, with an assumption apy stays the same and issuance increases proportionally, it would take hundreds of years to have any meaningful divergence in the current apy, assuming there are no external actors/stakers coming in. \n\nIn your example for 1000 blocks, the 32 eth validator rewards diverges\n\nBut for 365 blocks (1 year if each block is a day) in this extreme case the percent of validators goes from 32% to 41.4% (i wrote a script). These 365 blocks equate to roughly 228 years of eth staking rewards, assuming a constant 5% and each block equates to a day. This divergence of network control is far less effective if the unvalidated eth rewards earn a 85% effective yield if they were staked using a decentralized staking service, which in reality is something people would do, not all but it would decrease the effect at least. Even without unstaked eth earning rewards, the percent change isn't dramatic even after 228 years.\n\nThe numbers you were previously suggestioning are not nearly as alarming as you were claiming. I did the math, but are more than happy to show my work.\n\nYou make a point of a supply side attack, which makes sense for exchanges that offer staking services if they dont actually stake, and instead use the accumulated supply to sell/manipulate the market, but this concern is always present in an ecosystem with whales and is not a concern unique to pos systems. In the case of stakers generating rewards and increasing their proportional supply, the issue is that they have to stake to maintain their increasing rate of returns which means it will take longer to pull the funds out to make an attack, as only a set rate of validators can be unstaked to be used in this attack.",

There is a peg that connects 1 and 2 bi-directionally, creating a feedback loop effect.\n\nTo compare to Proof of Stake systems: There is no arbitrary minting that can lead to hyperinflation, there is no mint/burn based on market forces (can argue that eip1559 is some burning based on market forces and staking rewards are somewhat variable based on participation, but it's still quite different), and there's no peg to create a feedback loop.\n\nTo be clear: I'm not claiming that anything is bullet proof, but I do feel that the comparison with Terra/LUNA is not apt.\n\nOne more trap that is easy to fall into: Staking for collateral, staking for vesting, and staking for validating are very different concepts that aren't interchangeable.",

                    "response": "In short, yes. This is one of the biggest aspects of PoS that gets swept under the rug. PoS isn't proven to be as secure or more secure than PoW, it's just being pushed in part for political/marketability reasons and in part because of scaling issues. It's effectively a trade-off between the stringent security that requiring 51% physical compute hardware provides in PoW, and the scaling of PoS. \n\nPoW is already reasonably vulnerable at the very topmost levels as it requires the hardware to be intact, powered, and connected to the network and all 3 are attack surfaces that entities like govts can target. \n\nWith PoS, it's more \"ethereal\" (pun 51% intended) and game theoretic. In practice, staking security is significantly less resilient at the topmost levels because staking is almost completely detached from the physical world. In the real world, thermodynamics and resource supply chains and manufacturing capacity and human/technical/financial capital are all critical elements that much be maintained through significant coordination, usually by well-financed corporations and/or govts, in order to even attempt to compete. In PoS, almost none of that applies. At least, in equilibrium. Right after the transition, and for some time after, there will be the residual effects of ETH having been PoW.\n\nIf you want to take it up a notch, check out the equilibrium models for utility networks. You won't like the implications for PoS security.",

The token/system must be kept intentionally obtuse and inefficient in order to support a given price, and this isn\u2019t really the Ethereum vision. \n\nThe Ethereum vision is a benevolent system that\u2019s going to clean out the cobwebs of legacy systems and enable heavy decentralization of practically every aspect of the economy (\u2018\u2019member \u201cdecentralized Airbnb\u201d?) through hypercompetitive money that has an arbitrarily large amount of instant, zero cost, programmable transactions. \n\nBut the security model chosen to get there is dependent on circular logic and feedback loops that are negative in reality somehow turning positive. As it stands, this is going to turn into a rent-seeking arrangement and the consensus will only be able to be maintained if the profitability for stakers is there, which will necessitate either/both a constant Ponzi-esque drive for token price action, and/or impedance and \u201ctoll-taking\u201d on the network in order to extract value for the validates. \n\nIf some entity locks up $64k of eth to run a validated instead of any other use of that money, they are incentivized to keep the costs of the network high and the utility low so they can extract as much as possible in as little time as possible. If an entity locks up $64m, they are also incentivized even more so to spend money on things like marketing campaigns or photogenic development teams, etc. to drive price action but disincentivized to support lowering the impedance and increasing utility of the network. Any increases in perceived utility that get people to buy? Yes. Any increases in real utility that reduce costs and increase velocity? No.",
