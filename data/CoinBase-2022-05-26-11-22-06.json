Here's my situation, and I hope anyone reading this and thinking of moving to a new country to keep your account up to date before you move! That was my mistake.\n\nI recently moved to Japan and now I have a Japanese phone number. Tried the 2-step verification but the two options given don't work.\n\nOption A. The verification asks for your current primary phone number but the country code is grayed out so I can't even input my new (Japanese) phone number. So I can't move forward to the next step of verifying my I.D and photo.\n\nOption B. They asked me to create a temporary new account and verify the new phone number. The problem with this option is that creating a new account in Japan requires a Japanese driver's license, which I don't have. \n\nThe Coinbase Support suggestions just say the same thing every email, going in circles, not really providing an alternative insight for other options. Utterly useless.\n\nAm I missing something? Perhaps others can provide suggestions?",

I saw a message that I needed to identify my Identity or else my account would be limited to withdrawals if I did not respond by July 17, 2022. I then contacted Coinbase and they told me to create a temporary account using a different email which I did so they can update my phone number. They then asked me to upload my Identity document and take a selfie which I did. I was then told to provide 3 months of bank statements which I did and answer 3 other questions which I did. I would like access to my original account as I have complied with all of the legal documentation and answers. \r  \n\n\nCase #11990106",

They don't actually read the issue and hope it goes away. Good luck resolving your issue.",
