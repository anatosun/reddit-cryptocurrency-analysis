Bitcoin no longer has a Blocklimit but has a weight limit of 4 million weight units (wu) for the purpose of balancing UTXO costs(better represent resource costs) and making Bitcoin more scalable and more secure. \n\nThus you will see vB  (Virtual Bytes) or vMB (virtual MegaBytes)\n\nweight [wu] = 4 [wu/B] \u00d7 non-witness length [B] + 1 [wu/B] \u00d7 witness length [B]\n\nHere is the math and examples of different types of txs =\n\nhttps://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/84004/how-do-virtual-size-stripped-size-and-raw-size-compare-between-legacy-address-f/84006#84006\n\nSince there are 1024 Bytes in a MB , the native segwit tx example above would be 0.20407 vMB or 210 vB\n\nYou will see native segwit txs (txs sent from an address that started with bc1 ) has the smallest vB size , thus the least fees.",

Some developers call a unit of vsize by the name of vbyte[\\[9\\]](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weight_units#cite_note-9) because the number of bytes and vbytes in a transaction are identical for legacy transactions.\n\n[Source](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weight_units)",
