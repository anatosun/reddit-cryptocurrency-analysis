Just walked into a shop, and they had a little qr, scanned it, and that was that. Really simple and easy and better than the alternatives on the market. The only competitor I see for it is exeno, but that works differently since they have a whole site for crypto-commerce, so I guess Binance Pay is still king. \n\nThe reason it is not so popular yet, is that people think it is complicated. When it\u2019s really not. It\u2019s as simple as sliding a credit card. In fact, I think they do have a card system too! Crypto really needs something like this for real-life practicality, and Binance comes in clutch with this move. \n\nThere\u2019s the issue of large payments however. I haven\u2019t had the chance to use it for a payment over 50$ however, so is that still the same? Even for payments up to the 5k and 10? I would think it\u2019s best tailored to small, fast payments rather than large ones. However, I would like to hear about your experience with it, especially with large payments, before I try it myself.",
