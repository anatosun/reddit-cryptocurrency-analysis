I wonder how much of the in-reserve BTC they've sold trying to get that UST back to peg. If they've burnt through it, then, UST is likely going to run down to zero eventually. But there'll possibly be knives and bounces to trade, so there's potentially money to be made, but the risks are increasing every drop. Good luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Ooof, UST down to 0.72 right now...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Wow, look at that market cap ratio between the two. LUNA needs to be above UST for there to be enough for UST redemption. Currently the ratio is about 1:3. So there is three dollars of UST for every LUNA. This is not sustainable.\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=CRYPTOCAP:UST/CRYPTOCAP:LUNA",

And so part of the problem that I see with bitcoin is that many of it's use cases can now be done elsewhere---on other chains, with less volatile assets. For example, the company making the news recently for having one of the largest shares of bitcoin did so because they used BTC as a collateral in a loan. Nowadays, thanks to DeFi, anyone can do the same with less volatile assets (ex: stablecoins). And so, there is less demand for bitcoin. \n\nIn other words, IMO, I see BTC as \"legacy\" technology that is just waiting to be replaced by shinier, new technology. (For any devs out there, BTC is equivalent to jquery :-) )",
