He claims their prices are too volatile to serve as a practical means of exchange and lack the underlying use cases to serve as stores of value.\n\nHe added that the price of groceries also regularly fluctuates against Bitcoin, further impeding its adoption as a medium of exchange. Indeed, Bitcoin\u2019s price has seen major volatility to the downside over the past 7 weeks, breaking an all-time record for its longest weekly bearish trend on Monday.\n\nIn fact, Bernanke believes Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cmain use\u201d is within underground economies for facilitating illegal activity.\n\nWhat is your opinion on such position?\n\n[Source: tokenaround.com](https://preview.redd.it/jv1skkbgh1091.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=39f2933d286f95e8f135e7e16232f0bf6e19867e)",
