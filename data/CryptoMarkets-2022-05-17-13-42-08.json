Indeed, Bitcoin\u2019s price has seen major volatility to the downside over the past 7 weeks, breaking an all-time record for its longest weekly bearish trend on Monday.\n\nIn fact, Bernanke believes Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cmain use\u201d is within underground economies for facilitating illegal activity.\n\nWhat is your opinion on such position?\n\n[Source: tokenaround.com](https://preview.redd.it/jv1skkbgh1091.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=39f2933d286f95e8f135e7e16232f0bf6e19867e)",
