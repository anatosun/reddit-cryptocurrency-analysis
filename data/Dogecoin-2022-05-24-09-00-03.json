My 17 dollars now goes into doge everyday. I did it for me. Doge still represents something good. I was literally killing myself. This is not financial advice. But we need to remember why we are here. Yes I want money too. But this community, this coin, is what brought us together. I don\u2019t know what anyone can afford. But I do know we all have a vice that we can quit and invest in ourselves. Our children, and our future. I am nothing but a tear in the ocean, and I don\u2019t want to be anymore than that. But this is our coin, our future. We create the value. It is now time.",

Plus advanced options like stock lending. \n\nIt's the only Brokerage in the US that I am aware of that does all of the above in one account. \n\nIt doesn't hurt to move some of your coins off a brokerage if you do not plan on selling into a cold wallet. A cold wallet is a hard drive for crypto that does not connect to the internet. Leger is a good one available on Amazon.\n\n If you want your own keys but also want a wallet on your phone MyDogeWallet and Coinbase wallet are very good. Be aware as it is connected to the internet, it has slightly higher risk, although you do keep your own keys.",
