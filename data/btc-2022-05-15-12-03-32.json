I've also transacted very regularly with BCH for several years, and without any hoops to jump through or disappointments... it just works.   Lightning is no longer in the early days.  Even the developers have acknowledged the great limitations it has yet it's still being sold as \"the solution\".  Just to be clear, I'm great with layer 2 solutions, as are most big blockers, just not at the expense of crippling adoption of a P2P electronic currency.  Growing Bitcoin faster than governments and banks can fight back against it is imperative.  Blockstream was the answer to halt progress of the project.",
