There was an interview once with Tom Woods where bch was mentioned and he did not get a very tolerant response from Ammous.  I'm not an academic economist and even I find competition among private currencies a remarkable new reality.  The differences between the various implementations, and the implications of those differences, are fascinating to me.  So at that time I didn't think his views very sophisticated and I never bought his book.",
