A very important point, is that people in the Caribbean, are WILLINGLY, using Bitcoin Cash, as opposed to being made to use it! \n\nWhy? Because, it is fast, inexpensive to facilitate the transaction, and it is P2P decentralized cash!\n\nPoint # 2, is that they have a closed loop system! People and merchants are spending and accepting BCH, and it is staying in the economy, and helping to keep it strong, and keep inflation, at bay! Awesome!!",
