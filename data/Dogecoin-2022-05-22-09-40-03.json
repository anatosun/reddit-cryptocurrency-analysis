You can also get the private key for this wallet from the SoDogeTip website. You can transfer dogecoins into this wallet address and begin giving dogecoin to other people on reddit! And using your key you can also send coins yourself, even if the tipbot is down\nMaybe you see a meme that made you laugh? Give them a few dogecoin.\nMaybe you see an insightful post that helped you understand something better? Give them a few dogecoin.\nMaybe you see a charity you'd like to donate to. Do it with sodogetip. \n\nYou can also get the latest version of the dogecoin wallet (version  1.14.5) from www.dogecoin.com \n\n---\n\nHere are some links and topics that people have wanted me to post here.

I just hope this coin continues on the path of destabilizing the American dollar and monetary system of the globe to a communist perspective to not take everything so seriously, this stuff is easy, fun, and you\u2019d see that if we\u2019d be able to move past this green paper in our wallets and numbers in our bank accounts to a silly coin originally made as a joke about crypto currency in general, and then, you have the revolution of doge. Which calls a particular question in every normies mind. Which is, \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of money anyway?\u201d And the answer to that is power, which I know the dogecoin devs take seriously, but the question remains that, when the future of financial economics relies on a satire cryptocurrency, and possibly the life or death of capitalism in America;  that\u2019s astoundingly hilarious.",
