From [vouching for MtGox solvency before it collapsed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/77vrek/roger_ver_on_mtgox_bitcoin_exchange_for_the/), to promoting Craig Wright [as if he were Satoshi Nakamoto](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/776fim/funny_how_all_the_criminals_and_fraudsters_in/), the owner acquired the \"r / btc\" subreddit and packed its mod team with paid employees to spread divisive misinformation about the bitcoin protocol and various individuals in the bitcoin space, including this subreddit as a whole. He has also leveraged the domain and subreddit to promote an impostor altcoin to unsuspecting newcomers as if it were actually Bitcoin. As such, the domain is considered malicious, and the r/Bitcoin mod team kindly asks that readers seek out credible sources to post instead.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
