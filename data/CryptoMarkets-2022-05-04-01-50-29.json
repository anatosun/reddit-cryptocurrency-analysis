Thereafter, the revised rates will apply. Cardholders who stake CRO after their 180-day lock expires will earn card spending rewards as per the schedule below:\n\n**B)** **Introduction of monthly CRO Card rewards** **cap**\n\nDepending on your current Card tier, there is a maximum monthly cap on how much CRO Card rewards you can earn when you spend on your Crypto.com Visa Card. For example, if you own a Ruby Steel Card, your monthly CRO Card rewards will be capped at US$25.\n\nThere is no monthly CRO Card rewards cap for Icy White, Frosted Rose Gold, and Obsidian cardholders.\n\n**C) Phasing out Card CRO staking rewards**\n\nCRO staking rewards will no longer be offered to Jade Green, Royal Indigo, Frosted Rose Gold, Icy White, and Obsidian cardholders from the Effective Date. Cardholders who still have an active 6-month stake and who staked before 1 May 2022 13:00 UTC will continue to receive their CRO staking rewards until the end of their 180-day staking period.\u00a0\n\nThere is no change to other Card benefits. You will continue to receive 100% reimbursements for your favourite monthly subscription services, including Spotify, Netflix, and Amazon Prime. This will be excluded from the calculation of your monthly CRO cap. Jade Green, Royal Indigo, and other higher-tier cardholders can continue to enjoy unlimited complimentary LoungeKey\u2122 airport lounge access.\u00a0\n\nIntroducing these changes to the card program is a difficult decision. We are committed to continue to explore and forge new partnerships to unlock greater value and benefits for our cardholders such as our partnership with Dosh, a cash-back rewards platform in the U.S.",

When it comes to streamlining processes, unleashing new business models, and lowering operational costs, one technology is assisting CSPs in their transformation: blockchain.\n\n  \nBlockchain technology can help CSPs cut down their costs, store their customers data in blockchain which makes them more secure and overall will help revolutionize this sector.  \nFor these reasons o believe that investing in companies that concentrate on telekom and crypto is the right way to go, Ive heard that Verizon and ATnT might go down this road as well as new companies like telcoin and Worldmobiletoken. \n\n  \nDo you believe with such a revolutionary potential in such a use for crypto there is a chance that investing in these projects is justifiable ?",

But this is a huge misconception actually.\nThe main two points of ETH2.0 are the merge and sharding.\n\nWhile the merge will drastically reduce energy consumption (up to 99%) that\u2019s literally all its goin to do. It has nothing to do with gas fees. It won\u2019t affect it any significant way.\n\nSharding on the other hand will definitely help lower gas fees but now in a direct manner. Sharding will help L2s and other scaling solution be more efficient which in turn will lower gas fees on Ethereum in a non direct way.\n\nThis is why you should NEVER dump your L2 coins. If anything yall should start accumulating cause the prices of L2 tokens will most probably rise.\n\nI have my bets on Cartesi right now cause their technology is comparable to the major players in the game except they\u2019re build on Linux which will definitely give them an edge when it comes to adoption cause we all know that the majority of operating systems run Linux.\n\nHopefully, with time, the traffic problem that\u2019s plaguing Ethereum would eventually be solved but until then we\u2019re going to keep relying heavily on L2s.",

ImmutableX has gone hard into NFTs and gaming so will probably continue to dominate that area. Optimism's DeFi ecosystem is predominantly built around Synthetix, with dApps like Lyra and Kwenta all based around the composability of synthetic assets. Arbitrum has gone for a more scattergun approach and has most of the big name DeFi platforms that you're used to on L1. Polygon is building lots of rollups with different properties that should end up with some level of interoperability between them. Then you've got zkSync with the first ever zkEVM already on testnet; dYdX which is a single purpose STARK based platform just used for a perpetuals exchange, but with such high adoption that some days it has more volume than Coinbase!\n\nYou're right, it's not clear which, if any will win out in the end, but as a user that doesn't really matter. You can always move assets from one to another with bridges like Hop and Across, so it's not like you choose one and then are stuck. If you move some tokens onto zkSync to make donations via Gitcoin Grants, then some cool new dApp you want to try is released on Arbitrum you can just move over!",

How is this scam playing out for ya!?  It s taking over an hour to send $$$. If i do not get it to my leverage  account within seconds i lose 50k. Now, i play hard n i like the 'edge' game. And trust me, so do the  crypto platforms. It s why they allow you to 10x levarege. Fills their treasure boxes real nice n real fast.  But i am not in it to finance platforms who it seems intentionally liquidate by manipulating the technology!!. This is not an investment then. Decentralized!? My ass! It is all synced across the board, it hurts to watch. 15 thousand coins with same price movement as bitcoin to a 'T'.   It s a scam!?  You can not have the right to liquidate your investors/clients, if u do not provide the tools for people to protect themselves. Thats like saying , after you deposited a check to your bank and had them tell you that your money's gone 'cuz the cleaning lady forgot to close the front door, no? Many people i know have been cleaned out, not because they did not have money to adjust their ltv leverage accounts but rather because the transaction time during sell offs magically flips from seconds to hrs!!!!???  Days!!!?? Wtf. And they literally were forced to watch their money disappear.  I actually once waited 23 hrs for a transaction to go through.  Who pays for this ineptness? !",

We have thousands invested...   \n \n\nThat's the crypto market.. and if you can't sit calmly even when you see your portfolio dip for months at a time.. then you have too much emotion invested in this and should reevaluate your position.. maybe talking to an investor and getting safe returns is more on your level.   \n \n\nI don't understand why people invest so much that it stresses them out when everyone here is constantly screaming warnings of how volatile this market is...   \n \n\nSo either learn to accept dips and plunges.. or you may have to get out before you give yourself a panic attack. If you are patient and know how to wait for a project to go upward, I would suggest you take a look at CoinFantasy, it might surprise you.",

I've even written circom circuits.\n\nBut when it comes to converting crypto to fiat so you can buy a house or some other use, doesn't crypto have make its way into a bank? And doesn't this pierce the privacy vail that was painstakingly created with Tornado Cash and a number of accounts?\n\nBut most countries except for a few auto-report bank account information. And trying to circumvent reporting only leads to more effort and possibly trouble. So basically, you will have to launder the crypto, which leads to all kinds of problems (I assume).\n\nTornado Cash will give a report on source of funds if you have the note, if you need to report to the government.\n\nSo why do you need more privacy than is already available, if you will have to report your earnings in order to enjoy the profits made in crypto, without looking over your shoulder?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheers",

Morris stated that, in backtesting, the ETP had been less volatile than 8 of the 10 largest stocks in the US over the past 5 years.\n\nHowever, not everyone convinced that the project is bound to succeed.\n\nKenneth Lamont, SFA for passive strategies at Morningstar, said the key question was what someone was investing in these assets for. \u201cIn terms of gold, you can say it\u2019s volatile but usually it\u2019s volatile when you want it to be. You want it to spike in times of crisis,\u201d Lamont said.\n\nAs for the cryptocurrency, Lamont mentioned \u201cif you don\u2019t want the volatility of bitcoin, then maybe you shouldn\u2019t be involved in bitcoin. In some sense you are buying it for its volatility. \u201cWith these asset classes, volatility is not necessarily the enemy,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m not sure this is a sensible approach.\u201d\n\nDo you believe in the potential longevity of BOLD?\n\n[Source: ft.com](https://preview.redd.it/0bgejc1z73w81.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a610afaa1257cbaa93b40340d300767ad6eaae5)",

They sure will.\n\nBut if you want to make big bucks then you\u2019re not investing in the right place. You need to start looking more into startups cause that\u2019s where the real potential is.\n\nThe only problem with startups (especially recently) is that they\u2019re prone to pump and dumps where early investors will end up dumping their coins as soon as they get their rewards.\n\nBut if you look for the right projects then this shouldnt be a problem really. There are some projects utilizing synthetic tokens where rewards get released based on adoption rather than a fixed time frame.\nDaFi protocol has been doing this for a while now and they saw great success off of it so you should be safe investing in similar projects.\n\nYou don\u2019t necessarily have to go all in with these projects. Just invest a very moderate amount. Even a small amount of money can end up being a huge sum if that project ends up pumping hard (as startups usually do)",

Among them is Gavin Andresen, who published in 2014 the last email he received from Satoshi Nakamoto on April 26, 2011, just 11 years ago.\n\nBut before that, a few days earlier, he had exchanged emails with Mike Hearn, explaining on April 23, 2011, that he had moved on to other things than Bitcoin:\n\n>\"I've moved on to other things. It's in good hands with Gavin and everyone.\"\n\nDetails on these emails are published on Mike Hearn's page: [https://plan99.net/\\~mike/satoshi-emails/thread5.html](https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread5.html)\n\nOn April 26, 2011, he then sent his last known email to Gavin Andresen:\n\n>\"I wish you wouldn't keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure, the press just turns that into a pirate currency angle. Maybe instead make it about the open source project and give more credit to your dev contributors; it helps motivate them.\"\n\nEleven years after Satoshi Nakamoto's last known online message, no one still knows who this mysterious figure was who gave birth to an incredible monetary revolution that the world will be able to benefit from.\n\nLet's hope that his identity will remain a mystery forever, and let's focus on the Bitcoin project as he wanted, trying to get the most out of it for the most people. Which has been done very well so far.\n\nThe best is yet to come for the Bitcoin revolution.",

Nevertheless, Musk changed his decision later, precipitating a decline within the worth of BTC and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnd what about [DOGE](https://swapzone.io/currencies/dogecoin)?

If supernets is Polygon Edge on steroids as claimed, then imagine what how much of value does it add.\n\nNow what\u2019s interesting is Polygon will be investing up to $100 million in projects that are interested in increasing their growth through Polygon Supernets chain. For all the devs out there, i mean what more could you ask for?\n\nPut aside that I\u2019m a huge Matic fan, to be honest, all I can describe this is to be a winning situation for everyone, investors, developers, and tech lovers. Polygon is leading with its comprehensive range of tech options, developers will be building as they want, investors will be gaining their profit, and bringing mass adoption to Web3 is sooner than ever!",

I am new to crypto and have a very basic understanding. I was invested in doge for 2 weeks and pulled out and sold last night as I was down 12% and today it went up as much as 25%. I\u2019m pretty pissed and figured I should try to get advice from people who have actual knowledge on crypto. What are the best cryptos short term and long term to invest in? I have been investing in stocks for about a year with pretty decent success, I couldn\u2019t invest big bucks so the returns haven\u2019t been crazy. I have a bit more $ to invest now and wanted to try crypto but I feel like I have no idea what I\u2019m doing. Thanks!",

This initiative might turn the country into the first African state to follow this way. \n\nSince CAR\u2019s economy has struggled for years, bitcoin is seen as one of the last hopes. After El Salvador adopted [BTC](https://swapzone.io/currencies/bitcoin), the number of  tourists has significantly increased, as well as the number of investments. Therefore, it would be safe to assume that CAR might feel similar positive effects.\n\nMoreover, the nation aims to imply blockchain technology in many sectors of its economy. Two of the leading political parties in the CAR has already voted in favor to support the nation\u2019s crypto agenda.\n\nDo you believe that bitcoin could benefit the financial progress of the CAR?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4962evfj1ov81.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=09666daa9c718dd415be41678e8b8cdb3a238a52",

Devita joined Polygon network around 4 days ago in order to maximize healthcare operations and processes, ensuring data serenity. By that I mean health records transmitted and exchanged securely, and stored in a decentralized way.\n\nIf you ask why to choose Polygon, simply Debora intends to attain lightening fast data access and transmission, and lower transaction costs. And as a result, provide users with personal data management and equitable healthcare. \n\nOn another exciting news, Polygon DAO launched Polygon village which is going to be a full stack ecosystem to help devs build and grow by giving access to all services and offerings ranging from hosting, audit service, infrastructure, api related services, and most important talent discovery. This will motivate more and more devs to migrate to Polygon network.\n\nToday Matic price is around 1.45$ trading at 50% below its ATH. If you check all price prediction platforms, headlines are positive. You can also do your own analysis and still discover that an increase in price will soon take place. Anyways, I want to be clear, this is not a financial advice. I\u2019m just giving a handful of fundamental reasons to remain optimistic on Polygon.",

            "selftext": "In more ways than one, the rise of GameFi and the creation of modern gaming experiences on sustainable and energy-efficient chains is crucial. The crypto sector as a whole is by now familiar with DeFi, and the pros and cons that come with it.\n\nGameFi has the potential to alter that by bringing its crypto tokens to an entire generation of developing/rural economies through a simple smartphone game. Take Axie, for example. Fifty percent of those who began playing the game had never heard of Bitcoin before.\n\nWhile games like Axie have high entrance hurdles, it's obvious that chains like Ethereum are proving to be a problem for these newly bred P2Es which require an insane amount of on-chains transcations, ETH doesn't really scale with that, also most p2e games are very low effort nowadays.\n\nA lot of major corporates are taking the leap and joining the Crypto space each in their own way, for example **Ubisoft** (the gaming giant) announced a partnership with the HBAR Foundation which is an entity dedicated to rapidly funding Innovators and entrepreneurs in the Hedera economy, it's been aggressively expanding the ecosystem and this partnership with Ubisoft is a huge milestone.\n\nI really think Hedera is a good choice seeing how fast that network is, it can reach a TPS up to 100K in addition to txn fees costing $0.0001, pretty impressive stuff if you ask me. I think news like this is really beneficial since people will be able to engage in high quality P2E while also paying minimal fees and not having to worry about reliability or downtime.",

During periods when there is either a negative or no big market movement, passive income streams supply some extra cash. With the present environment, this can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Here are my favorite methods of generating passive income through cryptocurrency holdings.\n\n* Using your own private crypto wallet, stake your currency or tokens on your preferred protocol. Validating blocks is a frequent means of contributing to the security of the chain.\n* Decentralized or Centralized Lending via a crypto platform and let them reimburse you for allowing the platform to hold or lock up your crypto. In this scenario, the mechanism is different. You can typically get good rates, but the drawback is that you will need to lockup your crypto for higher earnings. Examples are [Haru Invest](https://haruinvest.com/), Celsius, and Nexo.\n* With the help of LP Tokens. The most profitable, but also the most risky. You can create a pool of token pairings to be swapped by users.\n\nHow about you guys? Tell me your most favorite holdings for passive income with crypto!",

The only work involved is to ensure you have that ADA back in the staked wallet for the next epoch.\nEdit: spelling",

As of now, I\u2019m looking into [k4 Rally](https://k4rally.io/?r=1), [Defimons](http://defimon.io/), [Illuvium](https://www.illuvium.io/), [Legends of Elumia](https://www.elumia.io/), and [Metawars](https://metawars.gg/). Super short description of the games: K4 rally is a rally racing game, Defimons is like bootleg pokemon, Illuvium is an open-world game that reminds me of monster hunter, LOE is an MMORPG, and I don\u2019t have any idea of Metawars that much since I just saw it before posting this lol. I might as well include it so I can know your insights on it because I can\u2019t access their site right now.  \nThere are a lot more games that I want to include but I\u2019m not sure of those yet. As you can see, I'm not concentrating on a single game genre. So, if you have any suggestions, please leave them in the comments and I will do my own research on them.  \nWhich one are you most excited to see?",

With the amount of money on the line and the amount of hacks  happening every single day. A bug bounty program is an incentive towards  better security. The bad guys are never taking a break so why should  your security? You may have a security team as far as the large scale is  concerned. They simply CANNOT find every single bug under every single  nook and cranny.\n\nWe something in  the cyber security and hacking world called hack value. The term is self  explanatory but It's basically the value of a target and what you can  get out of putting time and effort that's going to go into hacking it.  Crypto technology is an incredibly valuable for a hacker because of just  how much money is involved. Using Polygon as an example, they launched  their bug bounty program and a bug was patched that could have cost the  chain MILLIONS.\n\nIt's sad to see  how little these massive projects worry about their security when  there's literally billions of dollars involved. There's a little quote  that says \"You don't buy a screen protector before your screen breaks.\"  but as far as security is concerned we MUST be pro-active. There is not  only money at risk but reputation.\n\nFor  the sake of conversation, I'm not sure if there area any security guys  here but I've been consistently hearing that none of it will matter when  ZK comes out and that it's impenetrable. NOTHING is impenetrable and  unhackable, nothing. Thoughts?",

Until digital land is scarce --and someone can't just spin up another server/chain with a forked/parallel/new metaverse-- it won't be valuable.\n\nThere are exceptions to this.

But this presupposes a base location that has some established desirability.\n\nOne smart play would be e.g. Meta saying: \"Here's a bunch of assets/data that are only consumable in our 'Verse... And will continue to support/augment that utility over time\". In this case, it's got value because it's an accumulated data moat or a deep-pocketed daddy (#2 was the bet most if those silly kids placed on EOS, essentially, smh) This is also the principle behind the USD as a reserve currency: \"It's stable and valuable because there's a massive force behind it.\"\n\nYup, in many cases centralization defines/creates/protects economic value.",

It\u2019s true that crypto is giving us an opportunity to achieve financial freedom, as its true that only a few will get there. So keep your focus on the process if you really want the result.\n\nMy ultimate advice is never to invest in a project without reading its whitepaper, understanding it\u2019s purpose (what problem does it aim to solve), and evaluating its team. Believe me when I tell you, a bit of research makes a huge difference. \n\nTry to relatively diversify your wallet, and rebalance based on each coin\u2019s performance, especially that the market differs if it\u2019s bullish or bearish. Keep in mind that to make money in crypto it\u2019s not about getting every call correct. In fact you can make a number of bets, and only hit one winner to still come out ahead.\n\nPersonally I am a huge fan of technology, that\u2019s why my wallet is based on MATIC tokens to hodl. Polygon has proved itself to be a top notch technological project trying to improve and shape the ecosystem. But of course that hasn\u2019t stopped me from owning other coins, some resting with MATIC, while others being traded kind of on a daily basis.\n\nManaging a portfolio isn\u2019t simple, so start small. Believe there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. With experience start expanding your wallets. Don\u2019t forget you need to keep your track on what\u2019s happening in the market and following up on the daily news.\n\nLet me know if there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve missed. Hope you all be satisfied peeps! Goood luck!",

He was actually smart and one of the few \"experts\" who actually had something interesting to say. Then 2016 came along and the whole blocksize debate started. It was during this time, Jimmy started wearing that stupid hat and it must have rotted his brain away. Once the Bitcoin establishment accepted him as one of their own celebrities, he's become just so insufferable. If you can track down a video of him before the hat, you might actually hear him say something smart.",

I did simple research but most of them, almost say the same thing. Here is a sample [article](https://www.followchain.org/ethereum-vs-polygon-nft/) that I found.  It will be a more lengthy process being it on Polygon but you won\u2019t need to pay a lot of fees including insane gas fees. Minting on OpenSea using Polygon is cheaper too. Also, Is it true that it\u2019s more appropriate if you intend to sell a large number of NFTs? Do you guys have any idea what other reasons they chose Ethereum over other networks?

Meaning for example if i put the  limit buy of a coin at 1k but set the trigger price at 1.5k, does that means once it hits 1.5k l'Il instantly buy the coin at 1k price with 50% profit even tho bought it when its at 1.5k? Kinda confuse cuz if it actually is then lots of traders would've used this but i barely see people use this. Sorry I'm new\ninto crypto.",

But based off my research so far, it appears that choosing the right digital wallet is an important step in this whole process. Is there an overall wallet that people tend to go for? Or is it down to personal choice? Kinda like a bank account? Either way, hopefully this is allowed here, but any advice you can provide would be much appreciated. I kinda feel like if i don\u2019t start soon, I\u2019ll miss the boat and I don\u2019t wanna be left metaphorically and financially stranded in the future, as it were, whilst everyone made sensible investments and choices now, you get me? So any help and advice you have for a complete noob looking to get into crypto would be appreciated, thankyou.",

Turn off the TV and read the news or watch your local news which isn\u2019t as infested with so much propaganda. Cable news on both sides is degenerate information and while the left is better at communicating the truth they have corrupted the news just like Fox and made themselves into a propaganda arm of the Democratic Party. Read reputable news and if that is too much watch ABC, NBC or CBS. Those still have some basic journalism standards and they honor facts only news.",

            "selftext": "I'd like to share my brief journey on the PolkaDot ecosystem, which started back in April 2021 (almost one year ago)\n\nWith a shy purchase of DOT, most likely recommended by some random moon-boy YouTuber was my first step on the DotSama's land! It wasn't particularly a good entry, but the hype around it made it look good...\n\nBy then I dint't know much more about what Polkadot was besides being a smart contract platform and I HODL it, and eventually started staking it on binance for ages...\n\nFast forwarding to November, a friend told me about a super cool NFT bla bla bla... I didn't care. Until I l looked at it properly when I started reading Aleksandar Mitrovic's views on the NFT space (Unique Network's CEO) which he often shares on Twitter. That was a turning point for me both regarding NFTs and Polkadot! I use to joke that Aleksandar created a monster: me!\n\nI got interested in Unique Network's take on the NFTs, bringing utility to the table, and that made me follow & support the project and eventually made me want to invest in it! As a bonus it had to token, so it was as early as it gets, a moonshot could be just in front of me!\n\nGreed kicking in! And I wanted to get in...\n\nThe only way to invest in it was through Quartz's crowdloan for a Kusama parachain (which I had no idea what was: neither kusama, neither a parachain) and all of that sounded too complicated to me.\n\nFear kicked in! And so I dodged it but...\n\n...the seed was there and I started learning a bit more about Polkadot, like what a parachain was, what kusama was, what a Layer 0 was (also made me look into Cosmos), how the crowdloans worked, etc\n\nMeanwhile Quartz won the parachain and I got disappointed for missing it's crowdloan, but the truth is that I took the best decision: \"not touching what I don't understand\" and in the middle of the Greed and Fear I mentioned above, the fear made take the right decision and not letting the FOMO affect my decisions.\n\nFast forwarding to 2022, Unique had it's own crowdloan for a PolkaDot parachain, which it also won on a close photo-finish line against Litentry, which I took part as I already had a working and loaded JS wallet with KSM and DOT, and some experience transferring funds and using it, I already knew about the candle system for the crowdloans (which by the way I found brilliant to avoid manipulation), the competitive advantages it has against other smart contract blockchains on Web3 due to substrate flexibility,etc. Long story short I was much more confident and trustful with the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nFrom my research I found that the crowdloan system is a great hunting ground for new projects and it's quite competitive and that makes the projects stronger from the cradle, comparing with other ecosystems.\n\nNow I'm looking into Polkadot's DEXes and DeFi also! Looking into Clover Finance and Acala. If you guys have any tips on the best place to learn and start trying out some DeFi on the space would be much appreciated.\n\nAny random tips and advices on resources to learn further are even more appreciated!\n\nMeanwhile I just wanted the say it's great to be on the Dotsama space! Looking forward to grow wiser (and wealthy) as the ecosystem grows!",

Even tho the space is relatively new, we're all still early enough to witness the rise and fall of many networks and protocols.\n\nThe problem is all the talented Devs end up working on DeFi projects alone and forking each other in addition to using the same code over and over with different variable names, some of them start to inherit each other's exploits without even knowing.\n\nOfc I\u2019m not saying ALL DeFi networks and protocols suck. There will always be decent entities like the HBAR foundation, that puts together a grant application for entrepreneurs and innovators that have great ideas but don't have enough money or a good team.\n\nSuch organizations, in my opinion, are essential for the space, keeping in mind that true innovation needs the attention and effort of an entire team, not just a few individuals. I believe that developers should not waste their time and abilities on low-effort Dapps and projects that have been copied and repeated.",

So I bought in with the whole 15000 and took a huge loss now down to 7-8k . so in reality I really am at a loss for 2021 but from what Coinbase reported it just seems like I am up .

I don't think so, I see chains like Hedera offering KYC in addition to DLT which makes another added layer of safety on top of your average Smart Contracts and Ledgers, making it an environment where if hacks/scams happen, the culprit will always be prosecuted.\n\nI'll be honest the network is somewhat lacking Dapps but I believe in the HBAR Foundation since they've setup several funds this month that cover Sustainable development, DeFi and even a Metaverse fund. These funds are aiming to finance the best Devs and innovators around. Migration could be coming sooner than expected.",

There are many companies that\u2019ll take bitcoin  as payment now, like amazon, starbucks, paypal etc. \n\nThis being said if you\u2019re trying to invest in bitcoin or other currencies. Those who are starting out might choose exchanges like coinbase, kraken or binance just to name a few that have a \u201cwallet\u201d so you can store all of your digital currencies.\n\nCrypto Wallets come in many forms, \u201chot\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d wallets. Hot wallets are for online storage use. Cold wallets are offline hardware storage devices. \n\nI have compiled a few wallets that have caught my eye and maybe yours.\n\nExodus: It has no fees and is a hot wallet. It offers crypto exchange services for your desktop, phone and hardware crypto wallets. Gives you live charts and 24/7, 365 days a year customer support.\n\nSquirrel Wallet: Has no fees and private keys are not  required and if you\u2019re a mobile user you can control your assets from your device. This smart wallet will be a game changer when it is released. Rather than relying on controlling your wallet through a private key. This wallet\u2019s code is utilized and allows features to be programmed directly into the wallet. Having the ability to recover lost wallets without the need for seed phrases. Don\u2019t let the name fool you. \n\nElectrum: This wallet is for my advanced users and it specializes in private key encryption and two factor authentication. Just like Exodus, Electrum is a hot wallet that gives you online encryption. Also offering many interfaces like phone and desktop.\n\nI can go on and on about wallets, honorable mentions would be metamask, trust wallet, ledger, etc. etc. With the popularity of crypto I think the topic of having a wallet is missed. Just because you have some crypto in Robinhood doesn\u2019t mean it belongs to you. They belong to robinhood.",

These however tend to have lower APRs 15-40%. For example pairing atom and Cro to generate osmo. Both coins have uses across multiple defi platforms so they are not dependant on performance of that particular Dex. The reward token is and will likely decrease in value over time like any yield coin but you are not over exposed to this risk (osmo could be an exception for a few reasons).\n\nPairing with a yield farm token will almost always result in a decrease of your principle due to inflation and sell pressure which is usually offset by a higher Apr. For example osmo-atom to produce Osmo. \n\nWith ultra high Apr farming (high risk 200+%) you only need about $15k to pump out $500-800 a week. However with high Apr comes high volatility and it doesn't matter how high the Apr is if the rewards or principal is losing 10% or more each week. These are positions that may only hold for a few months at the best. If the Apr is in the mid 100s you can almost guarantee this. \n\nFor more generic asset pairings with  30-70% range you need $60,000 to generate the same return but will be exposed to some volatility as you are likely pairing with a yield token.\n\nFor stable coin pairings at the 8-15% range you will need $200k. \n\nFind your risk tolerance, spread across multiple platforms, read the white papers! You need to know if there are pegs to watch or inflationary events etc and how everything works.",

I am currently following a DeFi protocol that I can totally advise you to check and that is [Sheesha Finance](https://wagh.me/sheesha). I am super enjoying this rewarding staking platform that got me like 10 different projects for now.\n\nI only bought their sheesha token, and they started rewarding me with tokens of projects they invested in. So cool actually. You feel like a VC there as you get to vote to support the future projects you crave most, they include you in the decision-making process. Sheesha Finance brings VCs to the masses and invests for you in the most promising projects. Super bullish on the insane rewards you can get from this platform.",

If it gets to late 2023 and they haven't all been filled, then buy at whatever the price is because it likely won't be that cheap again as the 24/25 bullrun anticipation builds.\n\nThat's basically my tactics.

It is, that\u2019s what I\u2019m seeing as roughly half of all functioning dApps in the market are built on it. But you know the problem is Ethereum has its limitations like low throughput, poor user experience, tech stack which is not customizable as is its governance dependance.\n\nMany projects tried exploring Ethereum compatible blockchains as a way to mitigate these limitations, but the truth is there\u2019s no specialized framework to build such blockchains or protocols to connect them. I believe this where Polygon comes into the picture. \n\nPolygon is a remarkable blockchain with a slew of benefits. I mean processing 3.5 million transactions per day each costing less than one cent is something fantastic serving as a solution for Ethereum\u2019s congestion. Also offering a wide range of solutions for a variety of problems such as compatibility, scalability, security, interoperability, and modularity. \n\nKeep that in mind peeps, MATIC\u2019s aim is becoming the internet of blockchains whether you believe in it or not, making Ethereum accessible to everyone. I personally believe that such a strong network with already existing partnerships and successful products and future technical advantages are more than enough to secure Polygon\u2019s existence. So instead of looking at Ethereum and Polygon as competitors, I think we\u2019d better start understanding them as a synergy.",

I am looking for projects that will be here in 10 years and have a real life impact. There are plenty of projects that have this potential, but that gives you the next dilemma: What is the project really worth?\n\nComing from a Finance background I like to value a project, which is sometimes difficult in Crypto. Just saying the price will go to $1, $ 10 $1000 or the Moon is not a real metric I would like to rely on.\n\nI have been using a Discounted Cash Flow model, which can be applied on projects with enough transparency, actual business model and something that could be considered as a Cash Flow. This way I can make a rational decision in investing.\n\nAs an example I applied this to **GET Protocol** (NFT Ticketing Project), each ticket sold uses a certain amount of $GET, while the supply is capped. This usage can be seen as a Cash Flow and used in your model. This gives me an intrinsic value of about x10 todays price. For more on the project I can recommend this blog:\n\n[https://medium.com/coinmonks/nfts-are-much-more-than-just-jpegs-99c20cd963fd](https://medium.com/coinmonks/nfts-are-much-more-than-just-jpegs-99c20cd963fd)\n\nThat being said probably there are other models/methods out there that also work good in crypto. Curious to hear what you guys use to value a project?",

Its government will reverse opposition to cryptocurrencies for the good of Great China\n* Russia will fall into desolation and be disgorged economically and socially in the western world\n* Some benefits such as economies of scale and efficiency from globalization will diminish worldwide, more so outside the EU and the Americas\n* Cryptocurrency's total market capitalization will exceed $150+ Trillion USD.\n\n**15 years of stupendous crypto growth has commenced.**\n\nEpochal challenges and changes have commenced worldwide, sadly caused by a blood-thirsty Putin killing helpless women, disabled, children, orphans, etc\n\nEU, European nations, and the U.K. will spend huge and reconstruct Defence and Energy. Demand and Construction will increase, likewise prosperity.\n\nPrice rises for Oil, Energy, and Commodities will cause inexorable inflationary pressure and inflation will be in excess of 5% in the short to medium term across dependent countries. In the long term the dislocation within, and regression from globalization will result in, almost immutable, inflationary pressures globally, especially in dependent countries.\n\n**And, oh, add decreases in Efficiency.**\n\nThe power, spheres of influence, and economy of China will needlessly fall due to its support of Russia, irrespective of its understandable anti-American perspective. Nevertheless, its stance will come at a net cost to Great China. Thus, possibly throwing away its golden chance to usurp or replace the USA in some respects in world affairs.\n\n**The world needs a prosperous and Great China.**\n\nPutin has atrociously ostracized Russia for at least two more generations after this, with his evil-laden and senseless war. The gross miscalculation of Putin and the Russian Army in invading a peaceful, progressive Ukraine and friendly Ukrainian people is a game-changer in world affairs, world trade, and will cause a realignment in various economies, increase inflation and provide fodder and a massive accelerator for the adoption and growth of cryptocurrencies worldwide.\n\nChina can't save Russia, neither its brain drain nor corporate exodus. It has instead helped to solidify the dominant position of the USD and by extension spur the growth and entrenchment of the world\u2019s sole superpower, the USA.\n\n**Why?**\n\nIt\u2019s now practically impossible to replace the USD in global trade or in Russia\u2019s trade with the world or the USD as the world\u2019s prime reference currency.\n\nThe USD is in widespread use worldwide and it\u2019s backed by a democratic government system, the largest and most liquid bond market, furthermore by higher hydrocarbons production, and by the world\u2019s largest economy with an unparalleled innovation culture, and equity markets, and venture capital sector.\n\n**Still, looking for further proof?**\n\n[The Executive Order on Digital Assets by President Biden on 9.3.22](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/) will accelerate the innovative streak of God\u2019s own country, the USA.\n\nCryptocurrency's prospects have never looked or been this good. Viewed from all perspectives including governmental, inflationary pressures, and huge public awareness, institutional adoption, and HODL; cryptocurrencies will invariably and inexorably rise in value, become pervasive, and a powerful driver for creating prosperous peoples across the world.\n\n**Global poverty will be lower.**\n\nAll told, earthly factors and the gods favor cryptocurrencies and related sectors. I foresee stupendous growth in the total market cap of cryptocurrencies in excess of $150T, powered by endemic adoption worldwide and the proliferation of cryptocurrencies.\n\n[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy Mr. Michael[Ultainfinity Global Group](http://ultainfinity.com/)Founder, Chairman & Group CEO",

                            "response": "Src below...\n\n\"RAND finds that Republicans swallow fake news more than Democrats\n\nA RAND study released this week offers more evidence that \u201cboth-sidesism\u201d does not belong in an honest discussion of fake news and propaganda in the U.S. People on the Right are simply more apt to fall for it than those on the Left, the research shows, and for a number or reasons.\n\nSusceptibility to conspiracy theories and fake news has already been linked by researchers to people in minority groups and lower income brackets. And higher income, higher education levels, and whiteness have been linked to greater resistance to such beliefs. But linking the appetite for, and susceptibility to, fake news and propaganda to Republicanism has until now been elusive.\n\n\u201cWe found some of it on both sides, on the left and the right,\u201d says RAND researcher and report author Luke Matthews. \u201cBut we found more of it on the Trump voting Republican side.\u201d\n\nThe researchers surveyed 1,333 Americans from a carefully balanced set of demographic groups from February 26 through March 13, 2019. Respondents who had internet access took an online survey; those who didn\u2019t were provided a tablet computer on which to respond to questions.\nRAND sat out to find what kinds of cognitive bias and reasoning functionality were most reliably associated with susceptibility to misinformation in different kinds of people.\n\u201cCognitive biases\u201d are \u201csystematic patterns of deviation from norm and/or rationality in judgment,\u201d says the Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology. RAND screened for a number of bias types, including \u201cingroup bias,\u201d which refers to tendencies to lean toward beliefs favored by groups that share a \u201clanguage, religion, or nationality.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also looked for connections between people\u2019s comfort level with numbers, or science, or \u201cmagical thinking\u201d and the propensity for believing misinformation. As it turned out, Matthews tells me, it was the presence or absence of these reasoning abilities that provided the best predictors of people\u2019s susceptibility to misinformation.\nIt found\u2013not surprisingly\u2013that people who demonstrated more numeric and scientific literacy, and less magical reasoning, were less likely to swallow misinformation and disinformation. And it found these people collected in certain demographic and political groups.\n\n\u201cResistance to Truth Decay . . . was associated with having a higher income, identifying as White, voting for Clinton in 2016, and being less religious,\u201d the report states. By \u201ctruth decay\u201d RAND means, broadly, a willingness to believe falsehoods, and a resistance to authoritative sources of information such as scientists and other experts.\nThe reasoning processes that are predictive of belief in things like \u201cbirtherism,\u201d \u201cplandemic,\u201d and \u201ctrutherism\u201d are not gained or lost suddenly with the support of a particular candidate or cause, the report stresses, but rather are \u201cdeveloped over an individual\u2019s lifetime and are all at least somewhat adaptive . . .\u201d This, of course, points to the role of the education system to teach things like critical thinking and media literacy to children and adolescents early and often.\n\n\u201cSociety needs to be better at developing informed and critically thinking citizens who can appropriately process the rapid media environments in which information consumers must now operate,\u201d the report authors write.\n\nRAND\u2019s GOP-misinformation connection is made even more credible because the RAND researchers didn\u2019t go out looking for that specifically. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we set out to study but that\u2019s what we found,\u201d Matthews tells Fast Company. He said his team had to study all possible connections between demographic and political groups to make sure the connections they found could not be undercut by claims that \u201ctruth decay\u201d is actually caused by some factor the group didn\u2019t study.\n\nThe report is part of RAND\u2019s Countering Truth Decay initiative, which considers the diminishing role of facts and analysis in political and civil discourse and the policymaking process. The original report in the series was published in January 2018 and laid out a research agenda for studying and developing solutions to the Truth Decay challenge.\n\u201cWe need to have these political conversations and debates,\u201d Matthews says. \u201cWe can have the debate about politics and policy, we can have political disagreements and disagreements over values, but we need to have a basic agreement about what the facts actually are.\u201d\n\nThis aspect of American life, the capacity for citizens to argue well and respectfully, is arguably what has made American democracy work. That public trust has been badly diminished.\n\n\u201cPolitics has gotten so hyperpartisan,\u201d Matthews says. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten people detached from what facts actually are.\u201d \"\n\nhttps://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA112-17.html",

The last example is the Deliq Finance project. IDO's price of $DLQ was $0.15. Now the price is $0.13. At the same time, investors' funds are frozen due to vesting. Everyone received only 25% of their tokens on listing. In #Polkastarter and Deliq chats people ask about low price, but unfortunately most of the messages are deleted by admins.\n\nParticipation in IDO is a privilege investors pay for by buying POLS tokens. Even if we have POLS it is not a guarantee of approval, we must register in each project, then answer questions, subscribe to social networks, wait if we are lucky or not. Therefore the listing price must be higher than the purchase price, otherwise it makes no sense to conduct IDO. We can buy tokens on the market, and at the same time our funds will not be frozen.\n\nI thought that the Polkastarter gets our investments in order to filter for IDO for high-quality and honest projects. But now it feels like they are ready to place everything indiscriminately.\n\nWhat do you think of all this? Has the theme with Polkastarter's IDOs become obsolete?",

We're getting so many updates from both teams each and every day.\n\nThis only shows the entire crypto space how the HBAR Foundation is dedicated to rapidly funding the best Dapps and DeFi protocols only so Hedera can prosper and reach it's expected heights. I personally love seeing constant updates so I'm honestly thrilled to be part of this community.\n\nAnyways, let me know what you guys think about this. And please, don't blindly go and purchase HBAR, kindly DYOR, NFA and practice due diligence so you can conduct your own review on the investments you'd like to make in the future :)",

It allows it to list any asset with a chainlink price feed. Currently is has over 50 crypto pairs, and 10 Forex, already making it the most diverse leverage exchange whether DEX or CEX. And it will be listing stocks by months' end and commodities after that.\n\nIt is a crypto with an actual product/service that people pay to use, generating a large revenue stream for the protocol.\n\nThe best part is, not only does it distribute almost all of the revenue it earns, it is also very deflationary. It's well known that short term leverage traders on average lose more than they earn, and the net losses buy back the $GNS tokens on the open market and burns them. In a little over a year it has burned 25% of the supply, while providing huge yields to LPs (often in excess of 100%, and always over 60%). \n\nThe GNS tokens form the liquidity backstop to the protocol, and are a necessary part of the ecosystem. Not just a shitty inflationary governance token with no use case. \n\nOnce the gTrade platform is fully built out with commodities and indices, (estimated Q4), the team will begin work on a decentralized casino and betting platform that will utilize and reward the same $GNS token. \n\nWith many countries banning CEXs from offering leverage trading, there is a vacuum that needs to be filled. Like it or not, leverage trading is a huge percentage of daily crypto volume, and these users are not going away just because their governments don't allow it on centralized exchanges. \n\nNot many projects can boast $2.72M distribution of revenue in the month of March (annualized at $32.94M) at a tiny $80M market cap, while burning 25% of supply in a year.",

Mainly because here in Australia you can no longer leverage on binance and because the kucoin futures liquidation threshold can be as bad as -30% in some cases.\n\nOne problem this doesn't suffer from that leverage on a CEX does is the the lack of any price slippage - which is precisely why CEX liquidation threshold can be as bad as above for a newly launched coin (pretty sure it was DOGE that they did me dirty on when they first launched it). You lose your liquidity so fast when people are able to take out $1m positions on just 10k if its not synthetic. \n\nThe trade off is that its too early to say whether it will be able to offer lower leverages as efficiently - if it could capture the 1-5x market that would be incredible. If in future it proves  able to without the risk being too big there would be a huge market of potential CEX traders who don't want to KYC for whatever reason (as I imagine tax liabilities of borrowing 900k on a CEX vary between places).\n\nAlso, not gonna lie finding this project also spurred me into learning a decent base of solidity and javascript to run a liquidation bot, which has been a frustrating but rewarding exercise. Pretty grateful as nothing had actually pushed me to learn about crypto stuff more deeply than the very basics until it even though Id been into crypto since 2013 and now I feel like I have a reasonable handle on web3js, how ethereum/polygon and its transactions work etc.",

I guess you already know that transfer costs are greatly lowered when zk technology is used, making financial services more accessible for general use. So Hermez actually improves throughput by over 130 times as it reduces token transfer costs by over 90%, and allows for secure and quick withdrawals. \n\nIf we want to talk fundamentals and stay away from technical terms, Hermez is used for decentralized user profiles, with social features, and immediately compatible all other Hermez user ecosystems. Of course, this includes others participating in open standards, and is made to be plug and play for developers and end-users. Also immediately compatible with Lens and its ecosystem.\n\nOn the other hand, you shouldn\u2019t forget about Avail to order transactions and validate data availability as it provides a common data availability layer that can be used by varying execution environments such as standalone chains, sidechains, and off-chain scaling solutions. If you\u2019re looking for more efficiency and less risk in your development while having immediate compatibility with all Avail ecosystem users, you shouldn\u2019t be thinking twice.",

            "selftext": "Since at least 2019, Web3 projects have been incentivizing their communities to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges. Liquidity is the lifeblood of any protocol and facilitating that liquidity in one way or another is a basic prerequisite for a successful project.\n\nWhen Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap were the dominant DEXes, liquidity mining was relatively straightforward. All liquidity deposits on those exchanges are natively fungible, meaning that any deposit is directly comparable to any other one. Additionally, all liquidity deposits on those exchanges \u201ccover\u201d the full price range of the two assets in the pool, meaning that the AMM formula would serve up a price if token0 approached  an infinite value relative to token1 and, similarly, if token1  approached an infinite value relative to token0.\n\nUniswap V3 is now the dominant DEX, owing largely to its more expressive functionality. But with a richer feature-set comes greater complexity. One major casualty of Uniswap V3 is that liquidity mining now requires a profound technical expertise. Even launching an incentive on the full  price range \u2014 the most common approach to Uni V3 LM to date \u2014 still necessitates a degree of complexity.\n\nFear not, Web3-projects-looking-to-incentivize-Uniswap-V3-liquidity. A variety of teams are hard at work building solutions to simplify this process. Naturally, the team building xToken Terminal believes we\u2019ve built the most secure, complete and powerful solution. However, we\u2019ll still run through all the options that are out there in order to provide  you with the most complete set of information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A basic summary of the feature sets for different Uniswap V3 liquidity mining options](https://preview.redd.it/0mw54gluozr81.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=561c420be41794134ec9c66cff2bb01c49ba4ba9)\n\n## xToken Terminal\n\nTerminal is our new capital markets platform, designed to provide DeFi/NFT projects \u2014 and whoever else! \u2014 seamless and permissionless access to fundamental on-chain primitives. The first of these primitives is Uniswap V3 liquidity mining. Via Terminal, a Web3 project can have a [Uni V3 LM program up and running in a few minutes](https://docs.xtokenterminal.io/terminal/mining/create-pool). No dev work or Uniswap expertise required.\n\nPool sponsors select a liquidity pool and price range to incentivize, one or more rewards token(s) to pay out to LPs and an optional vesting period on rewards. Once the liquidity/rewards pool is deployed, sponsors can initiate a rewards program for any amount over any period. Once a rewards program ends, sponsors can initialize a new one. Sponsors never need to leave the Terminal UI.\n\nSimilarly, LPs never need to leave the Terminal UI. LPs do not need to mint an NFT position (the sponsor mints a communal NFT on pool deployment) or navigate to alternative UIs to deposit liquidity pool tokens. Data on staked balances, APR, pool history, etc are all generated permissionlessly and viewable on the Terminal interface.\n\nTerminal is available on L1, Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9gmsdnv0pzr81.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa4e4800406176f0faf5ee8ecf1a4189daab0586\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Gelato (G-Uni)\n\nSimilarly to Terminal, Gelato also provides a fungible interface for a non-fungible Uniswap V3 liquidity position. While Gelato does not actively rebalance liquidity positioning, the protocol provides a  manager role on their contracts that allows a representative of a project to actively re-position if desired.\n\nGelato/G-Uni does not provide any infrastructure for staking rewards, rewards  vesting or rewards data. Projects using G-Uni tokens for liquidity  mining will need to deploy/configure smart contracts and build a custom frontend.\n\n## UniswapV3Staker\n\nThe UniswapV3Staker contract is the most \u201cnative\u201d option available to projects looking to sponsor a liquidity mining program. The contract requires LPs to mint a Uni V3 NFT position and then deposit it. Rewards are paid out as a function of in-range liquidity, i.e. the more trading volume your position helps generate, the more rewards you will earn. This approach may be the most rooted in precision, but in practice it has been [marred by manipulation](https://medium.com/@revert_finance/onetickdao-eth-and-the-narrow-rangers-f9a376f7f0c9) as well as a bevy of UX challenges. It also requires deep Uniswap V3 knowledge to fully understand. Lastly, we\u2019re not aware of a full-feature UI for projects that wish to use the UniswapV3Staker contract.\n\nSome community members have proposed a few modifications to the contract \u2014 notably a change that requires LPs to cover a minimum price tick range. This change is likely to mitigate some or all of the issues related to manipulation of rewards, however, it is unlikely to allay any UX challenges.\n\n## Charm\n\nCharm\u2019s Alpha vaults rely on some of the most clever Uniswap V3 liquidity management logic that can be found in the space. Charm\u2019s vaults rebalance in a way that avoids a direct swapping of assets, instead relying on single-sided pseudo-limit orders \u2014 a Uniswap V3 hallmark.\n\n>Sidenote: many Uni V3 liquidity managers underestimate the slippage costs and gas costs of active rebalancing strategies, thus overestimating the expected value of a rebalance. Maximizing capital efficiency at a given moment does not necessarily lead to maximization of value.\n\nCharm is soon to release a permissionless version of their vaults (Alpha  Pro). It remains to be seen whether their approach, which is well-tested and successful on high liquidity pairs like ETH<>USDC, will be performant \u2014 programmatically or otherwise \u2014 on long tail pools.\n\nAt launch, Alpha Pro will not offer the smart contract or user interface architecture for native liquidity mining.\n\n## Gamma\n\nGamma pursues a more active rebalancing strategy, relying at least partially on off-chain logic that is not transparent to LPs. Though decentralization advocates may protest, there may be something to be  said for this more obscured approach, as purely on-chain rebalance strategies may be vulnerable to front-running or other forms of value extraction. Gamma is in the midst of remodeling their approach to liquidity management, so some elements of this description may no longer be accurate.\n\nGamma pools are not permissionless and there is no native liquidity mining architecture.\n\n# A Note on Rebalancing\n\nWe at xToken have been demo-ing our new platform for a variety of projects in the space. We\u2019ve been excited by the positive feedback we\u2019ve received on the platform\u2019s ease-of-use, configurability and  extensibility.\n\nSeveral projects have asked us why we don\u2019t offer the ability to rebalance  positioning in a pool. As the product currently operates, pool sponsors must set a price range at deployment and are unable to modify that price range (although deploying a new pool with new price range takes only a few minutes). While we are exploring methods of introducing this functionality, we believe that offering a rebalance feature on a permissionless platform like ours could expose our users to frontrunning and other forms of value extraction.\n\nWhy is that? We have experience with Uni V3 repositioning from our time managing [xU3LP](https://medium.com/xtoken/introducing-xu3lp-fungible-yield-f151c747131b), which for several months, was the largest provider of managed Uniswap V3 liquidity. It turns out that rebalancing must be executed very carefully, especially when the position in question is responsible for the lion\u2019s share of liquidity on the Uniswap pair (this concentration of pool ownership is likely the case for many LM programs). In carefully researching management strategies for xU3LP, we witnessed many instances of LP rebalances being front-run by bots on-chain. In short, rebalancing large Uniswap V3 positions requires a level of expertise and sophistication uncommon in the space.\n\n# Get in Touch\n\nInterested in learning more about xToken Terminal?

If most of the liquidity for BNB is paired to BTC and BNB is worth  x amount of BTC then if BTC makes a move down this will also bring down the USD value of BNB. The x amount of BTC you can get for your BNB is now worth less in USD then before the BTC move down.

When the Nasdaq and S&P go up or down, usually Bitcoin follows in the same direction but in a greater percentage in comparison. So you can apply the same reasons of volatility in stocks to crypto as a whole at this point in time.\n\nThird, the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami kicks off today. Some people bought crypto leading up to it and are now selling while more eyes are on the industry. If there are any major announcements during the conference that are more newsworthy than what\u2019s going on in traditional markets, we might see a short term spike.",

Even though you may recall when Ubisoft enraged many people, including its own employees because of almost the same reason lol. As we all know, Blockchain gaming is continuing to expand and improve that\u2019s why it\u2019s becoming a more competitive market. What impact would the entry of AAA game industries have on the market? Do you think it will help the developers step up their game? Blockchain games are still relatively new and there are lots of things to improve. The gaming industry as a whole is expected to be worth $196 billion by the end of 2022. I just hope that games like Illuvium, K4 Rally, and Decentraland are great once they are released or fully developed because many of us are anticipating those.",

Sure. Will they be bad? Of course. But that\u2019s just the reality of it. Some will take advantage and try to up their numbers some won\u2019t, it\u2019s the way it is.

I believe BTC and ETH will withstand the test of time and still have a lot of potential growth left in them. BTC is expanding throughout Central and South America as legal currency, and when the SEC approves a spot BTC ETF, institutional money will poor in. Furthermore, as FIAT continues to get devalued, people will look for sounder assets/currencies to hold their money in.  \n\n\nEthereum's smart contract capabilities are only just beginning to be understood and deployed. Ethereum's track record instills confidence in TradFi companies looking to cut down on middle-man costs of transacting large sums of money. Ethereum is battle-tested, significantly decentralized, and the scaling solutions being built on top of it will allow it to expand in the years to come.  \n\n\nPolygon network is my favorite scaling solution on Ethereum. While not the most decentralized or technically advanced, it offers users a simple, fast, inexpensive layer built on top of the rock solid Ethereum. Bridging assets to Polygon is straight forward, and more options are being built out all the time. Polygon is researching its own scaling solutions, including zero knowledge rollups. I think this will be a big winner long term.  \n\n\nIn addition to setting aside fixed money to invest on a schedule, I am farming stables on yield platforms, both centralized and decentralized. I believe the bottom of the crypto market will put BTC at or around 32k. If I see a rebound from there, I'll start scaling my stables into BTC and ETH.  \n\n\nWhat are your thoughts? What are your strategies?",
