I've been thinking about continuing to DCA a lower monthly amount into BTC and also picking up a market tracking ETF, since it's generally accepted that diversification is the way to go for building long-term wealth.\n\nThat said, every time I put more money into the stock market instead of into BTC, I feel like I'm robbing myself of the potential gains. The reason I'm investing in the first place is to try and limit the amount of time I have left in the rat race, and it feels like by diluting my monthly DCA into anything else but BTC that I'm pushing that eventual date further and further away.",

Even if the dollar's value becomes an issue, here is a likely scenario for building diversified DCA over the next three years.  You accumulate half a bitcoin, you own a home in a desirable location you own some gold/oil futures and you own the S&P500/Nasdaq100 baskets. In 10 years your home goes up a modest 10% gold and oil are up 20% because of a weakening dollar, BTC goes to 100K and your stocks are up 10-20%.  You will have built some decent wealth over 10 years even if a few of your investments don't hit.  The BTC purist either have little wealth now or are planning for armageddon if they put all of their money in BTC. BTC is an asset class so you should treat it as one.",

He was participating in SIBOS 2014 at Boston.  \nTalking to Bloomberg TV\u2019s Erik Schatzker, Bill Gates admitted said that the Bitcoin technology is key. The statement from the Microsoft founder is an indication that he no longer considers Bitcoin merely a technological tour-de-force but more than that. Bill Gates gave the final speech at SIBOS 2014, the annual SWIFT banking conference.  \nThe event is being held this year in Boston and attracting participants from financial and banking services industry. In his speech, Bill Gates shared his vast well of experience with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations\u2019 efforts to combat financial inequality around the world and also talked about the promising digital currency technology.  \nBloomberg News\u2018 Schatzker asked candid questions whether or not Bitcoin fits the bill; however, Bill Gates still marked worries about Bitcoin\u2019s use in terrorism and money laundering. Thus, so far from his statements about Bitcoin, it is clear that he now recognizes the promise of Blockchain technology.  \nEric Schatzker asked about the need to move money from place to place and the cost to do so i.e. the overhead vis-\u00e0-vis Bitcoin. Answering to the question Bill Gates said that Bitcoin is exciting because it shows how cheap it can be. According to him Bitcoin is better than currency in that users don\u2019t have to be physically in the same place and of course for large transactions currency can get pretty inconvenient.\"  \n\n\nSource: https://www.mql5.com/en/blogs/post/59201",

Gold is a little tricky, the intrinsic and extrinsic value is a little blurry. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>then say, i convert my russian fiat into btc allowing me to get my money out of the country--btc has an underlying value there right?\n\nFiat does not have intrinsic value, it is extrinsic. So when you transfer the money BTC has utility and extrinsic value. It has value to you at that time, so let's say you are right. But that would also mean Gates is right as its value is derived from what you are willing to pay for it. You transferring money does not add value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  so yeah, anything is only worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it, stocks/gold/btc/dirt/whatever.\n\nI don't agree here, if you go to a restaurant you may pay for a meal which was not worth the price for example. I know a lot of this seems just like semantics, as in what is price, value, worth etc. But I think it is important to see the nuance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>in general though, bill gates' point is there is no productive capacity of btc hence a lack of value, which is of course still wrong.\n\nI agree in general that is what he is saying. But I disagree in the \"lack of value\" part, he is saying its value is derived in a different way. I also believe value is in this case potentially also related to personal views. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>but when you live in a world where assets are things that generate 'cashflow' then btc seems more like a cost than a productive asset (again, i disagree here as well, just sharing that perspective).\n\nHere as well, I don't think he says it has no value. He is saying that he invests in products etc in a way which he sees value.\n\nThanks for the response.\n\nI agree with Gates in a way it is hard to determine where the value for BTC comes from, other than it does not come from a tangible product. I agree with others including yourself that there is value in BTC and it maybe be derived from its ability to transfer money for example, but a large portion of it comes from what people are willing to pay for it. The nuance as I mentioned is in how people are thinking about price, value, worth. Looking beyond price, and looking at the statement which he made is what is important.",

Bitcoin is no different. You say that, of course, value is subjective, but the things that value is derived from are not? How do you justify that massive logical leap?

Hell, Steve Jobs may not even make that list.\n\nSecondly. How would BTC be against Bill Gates financial interests? Explain that to me. Why would he care or not whether BTC is worth $1million/BTC or $0.01/BTC? How would that impact him?\n\nI can understand that everyone has opinions on the utility of BTC and some may be right and some may be wrong but a comment like yours is just pure delusion and disconnect with reality.\n\nEdit: Wow that's a lot of awards for a post with so few upvotes.

It's like an old VHS skate video-- Some people think it's incredibly valuable and will pay top dollar while others would walk right past it if they saw it in a yard sale. Crypto bros really bum me out because it's like they've got their egos involved. Why can't it just be a speculative asset? Does it have to add value to society? There's all types of shit that falls into this category and that's completely okay. \n\nI don't agree with his logic to not invest, I think it's worth a small position personally-- but to each their own. Do you still believe in crypto? Then who gives a damn what Bill Gates says. \n\nThe massive bull run will happen once there's regulation in place and big, institutional money can get in. Right now it's a primarily retail driven space. I'm getting off topic though. This shouldn't be the subject of your attention. \n\nThis is like celebrity gossip",

His circle of friends  include others who stand to gain from not devaluing  dollar-assets, and they have a lot of them.\n3. People often form and maintain opinions to justify past actions and beliefs.\n4. Bill Gates has a bad track record for adopting new technology.  He was late to the party  with the Internet, with WIMP (Windows Icon Mouse Pointer)  and the World Wide Web, (when he finally turned his company's attention to it he was able to use MS-Window's massive installed base to enable IE to eventually became a leader, but Bing not so much).\n5. Bill's fortunes and philanthropic endeavours rely on him not pissing off governments who, as you know, print and favour their own currencies.\n6. Bill had a lot of luck in life, but he  is very smart in his own ways.  Nobody is perfect in everything.\n7. People who think Gates is a sage just because he (was) the richest man on earth have a very superficial view of  how things work.",

I, for example, value Windows at zero, does that make it worth zero everywhere?\n\nAs for company value: take the market cap of a company as determined by its share price.  Now check its balance sheet. Subtract its total net asset value from its market cap.  That difference is value that doesn't exist anywhere, it's what \"some other person\" estimates the future wealth creation ability of the company to be worth.\n\nLet's play again... On, say, Microsoft's balance sheet, would there be a value ascribed to, say the brand loyalty of its customers?  Represented perhaps in all the intellectual property value of the various trademarks?  How much did it cost to make a Windows logo? Is that the total current value of the logo? Of course not. Where did that additional value come from, then? Where is it now? Could I buy it in isolation?\n\nIf the bitcoin network was privately owned by a single corporate entity, like say the WhatsApp network is, it would be worth billions, like say the WhatsApp network is.  That value is far higher than the simple crude addition of the purchase price of the servers that run it. Where's that value kept, point at it, show us why that's the \"ability to create great products\" that creates it.\n\nIn short: don't be such a damned short sighted fool, Bill.",

There will be less waste as a result.\n\nThis will lead to a paradigm shift where shitty products will disappear. \n\nAs lightning is further adopted, companies with business models of skimming fees will dissolve. People who spent their lives as rent takers will need new jobs. \n \nBut bitcoin as a store of value is equal worth, it means housing will become less of a store of value, and since multiple homes aren't needed empty homes will now house people.

Forex trading doesn\u2019t provide tangible output either.\n\nGates has shown a propensity to invest in companies that are building something to make the world a better place or to mitigate a threat (eg climate or malaria). Furthermore he tends to support projects that otherwise wouldn\u2019t get the attention that they should - eg low infrastructure toilets for third world, better nuclear reactors, carbon capture. Bitcoin is not short of attention.\n\nHe\u2019s absolutely right that Bitcoin is not an investment that produces valuable output the way a company does. Bitcoin isn\u2019t a company (cue Bitcoin CEO jokes). \n\nIt\u2019s two things: (a) a currency as discussed above, and (b) a layer 1 technology platform for financial transaction. Now here\u2019s the thing: investing in Bitcoin doesn\u2019t somehow improve Bitcoin technologically or product wise - contributing to the Bitcoin project (or at least running a node) does that.",

He likely has never used it, certainly, and frankly a US billionaire probably doesn't resonate with many of the Bitcoin concepts, such as banking yourself.\n\nSo to him it's just a number on a screen that fluctuates randomly.

The point of BTC is to have a limit on total created as well. You can own as many decimals (satoshis) of Bitcoin as possible, but there will never be more than 21 million.
