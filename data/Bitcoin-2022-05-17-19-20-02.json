Bitcoin and fiat  being digital in nature means we must compare the  durability of the institution/network that issues and secures them. I would suggest that Bitcoin will slightly excel responsible nation states here and does far better than  unreliable forms of fiat when looking at the history of fiat compared the the history and properties of Bitcoin(2017 gave a lot of credibility to Bitcoin in it thwarting a powerful attack and nation states have repeatedly attacked Bitcoin to one degree or another)\n\n**2) Portability** = Gold is horrible in this category being physical, heavy and unable to be sent digitally(custodians don't count as you lose most the benefits of gold and it switched categories from a bearer asset to registered value). Bitcoin beats fiat here too as its peer to peer , global and lacks regulatory friction. \n\n**3) Fungibility** Gold and Bitcoin tie here. When comparing fiat to Bitcoin it is more complicated but Bitcoin beats fiat here overall and is significantly getting better each year (see link above) . Physical fiat has some advantages over Bitcoin in the sense that its easier to have strong privacy locally as long as the whole \"anonymity set\" (group of users) avoid depositing the fiat in ATMs and banks(physical cash has serial numbers that are tracked with OCR + bill readers everywhere). Bitcoin can be very private if you use the right wallet and you take precautions but if you make a mistake you can also have problems. Digital fiat isn't very fungible or private at all. Gold isn't as fungible as many people suggest either due to different grading, certifying prices, forms which all fetch different prices.\n\n**4) Scarcity** -- Bitcoin wins this hands down with a fixed and limited supply. ~2-4 million BTc have been permanently lost/destroyed and many people also a long term investors leading to more scarcity. Gold is a distant 2nd with concerns in asteroid mining - (Psyche 16 as an example) and not knowing if any other large deposit can be found but far superior to fiat. \n\n**5) Divisibility** Bitcoin is already divisible by 8 decimal places onchain and 1/1000 of a satoshi on other layers like lightning. Thus micro txs are possible with bitcoin and too impractical with gold and not as easily done with fiat due to regulatory friction  and costs. The idea is that machines and software can tip other software, machines, and services by the minute or second to allow for more granularity and thus more efficiency with lower prices.\n\n**6) Acceptability** - Fiat wins this category for the time being due to its acceptance worldwide , especially US dollars. Bitcoin being a global currency without regulatory friction can one day overtake even the most accepted fiat however. Almost no one accepts gold for payment so its last and this is unlikely to change. \n\n**7) Verifiability** - Bitcoin wins here slightly over gold and fiat. Gold can be verified but takes more effort and there are concerns with tungsten filled bars and fake gold. Bitcoin being swept from a private key(coin or paper) or accepting an open dime is better than fiat physical cash, and digital fiat has very large concerns and delays in verification (chargebacks, fraud, etc...)\n\n**8) stability as a unit of account** - While Bitcoin is better than certain forms of fiat in this category, most are more stable than bitcoin and so Bitcoin remains 3rd compared to fiat and gold. We hope that Bitcoin in time will become less volatile with a much larger market cap . This trend is already occurring ,and much economic theory supports this happening but its still an experiment as to how long it will take and what size market cap / liquidity is needed",

To be fair one could make the argument that constantly tweaking the monetary supply allows economists to achieve better short term stability but this has yet to be seen. Conversely you could also fairly suggest that central planners meddling with a monetary policy can cause instability as well. \n\nThus perhaps comparing the market cap of a hard asset like gold to fiat is a better way to determine Bitcoin's possible future stability at the same market cap \n\nGold market cap - $11.512 T\n\nBitcoin market cap - $0.58 T\n\nUS dollar market cap - $39 T\n\nThere are plenty of fiat currencies with lower market caps than bitcoin however that are much more stable thus liquidity alone is not the only importance in stability as a unit of account. Part of the stability in fiat is likely in part due to their forced monopolies and the assets and resources a country has to hedge their fiat.  \n\nI would suggest Bitcoin can eventually become less volatile than gold based upon its fixed supply and steady monetary policy. IMHO we still don't know how stable bitcoin can become in relation to the most stable forms of fiat.",

Both will persist and many forms of fiat might use it as their hedge and reserve currency. One is a bearer instrument and the other registered value with different security assumptions and tradeoffs.

Another aspect with fiat is we still don't know if sufficient liquidity is going to be enough to make bitcoin as stable of a unit of account as the USD or euro. I would suggest that bitcoin would need to exceed the liquidity of an individual fiat currency by at least an order of magnitude to possibly become as stable as the most stable forms of fiat but this is still an experiment. \n\nBitcoin and fiat still compete as currency despite any of this.

In your example the price of eggs decreased and gas increased. Since sats stayed consistent, as more cannot be printed, we can presume the demand of eggs decreased, or supply increased, and the opposite is true for gas. This makes no sense as an example.\n\nThe power of having a limited supply of sats is that it would not be inflated away. In your example let\u2019s look at gas. We went to war, so presumable you think supply will decrease, demand will stay consistent, and this will lead to increases in prices. But the value of your sat relative to the original demand of gas is unchanged. The only thing that has changed is decreased supply of gas, leading to increased prices.\n\nIn a fiat currency, where more fiat can be created, the price would increase more than it would with a perfectly scarce currency (eg BTC). Because printing would occur, not only would supply for gas decrease, but more fiat would be chasing this commodity. This would lead to a higher increase in price due to the compounding of decreased supply and inflation of the currency.",

Like, if you have a 1.0oz gold bar, and you melt it down to mint 10 coins that contain 0.1oz of gold in each, how many ounces of gold do you have? Obviously, you still only have 1.0oz of gold. What if instead, you mint 100 very small coins that contain 0.01oz of gold per coin? Or 1,000 itty-bitty coins that contain 0.001oz of gold?     \n      \n>I guess that of course can make the USD value of BTC rise since you can always pull out $1 in value in some decimal amount of BTC.     \n     \nYes, and this is why being digital in nature gives bitcoin a much higher probability of becoming a currency than gold ever had. It's impractical to transact in microscopic denominations of a tangible asset, and you'd eventually reach an absolute limit to how many times you could subdivide an ounce of gold (i.e.- a single molecule). With bitcoin, however, the (theoretical) divisibility is truly infinite.     \n     \n>BTC being able to be infinity fractioned though also means it'll probably never be a stable value.    \n    \n\"Stable\" relative to what? On a long enough time scale, nothing in existence has a \"stable value\" because value itself is relative and subjective, and changes based on a little thing you may have heard of called \"supply & demand\". Once Bitcoin has matured to the point that it is as ubiquitous as the dollar is currently its value will be much more stable than it is now, but will still fluctuate due to economic conditions, population growth, \"lost\" coins, etc.",

When/if BTC dominance takes over and is proven to be more stable (20+ year timeframe type of stuff), everything will be priced in BTC.  \n\nNow BTC is the \"stable\" thing, and everything else will \"appear\" to fluctuate, but EVERYTHING is always fluctuating, people just think USD seems stable because you $1 USD = $1USD so they assume the asset price is moving, not the price of dollar.  In reality, they both move, but people have more faith in $1 buying the same amount of goods (to some degree).\n\nIt is really a matter of faith, if USD faith stays strong, it will continue being the world reserve, mostly everyone in crypto thinks that USD (or fiat in general) is a failing proposition though, because they wiggle the levers whenever it benefits them.  They adjust the how many dollars are made, and they trade bonds for goods (ie, create money, they have to pay bond interest yearly, and they just pay it with more debt)\n\nBTC believers trust ledger more than fiat.

What it seems you're describing above is the deflation or inflation of the currency itself. This is slightly different. \n\nBy definition a deflationary currency becomes deflationary as more currency is lost than put into the market. In this sense, current blocks are being completed and a certain amount of Bitcoin is put into the market. Bitcoin will become deflationary when more Bitcoin is lost compared to what is put into the market in a given time period. A currency is either inflationary or deflationary, there are no \"periods\" of deflation/inflation.\n\n>This is what is suggested would happen with scary terms such as \"deflationary death spiral\" but thus far Bitcoin has proven this incorrect.\n\nYeah, cause it's not a deflationary currency yet. Depending on the % estimates of Bitcoin lost each year, deflationary status will hit between 2030 and 2040.\n\n>This is believed to be caused by the feeling of newfound wealth(because they are wealthier) eventually overrides their desire to \"hoard\" (when did savings become a negative thing?) their Bitcoin.\n\nWould love to see actual studies on this. Currently, with fiat currency, the cost of goods goes up each year and thus the value of money is less and less. Thus, it makes sense if people come into wealth, they would look to spend it. \n\nBut you're saying the same applies to Bitcoin. So if I wanted to redo my kitchen with my newfound Bitcoin wealth, I could spend say $10k worth of Bitcoin (say 10% of my Bitcoin)... or just wait a year until that deflationary currency increases in value and that $10k the next year is now only 5% of my Bitcoin. This logic does not work with a deflationary currency. There is no reason to spend that money. Hoarding is always the best investment which is horrendous for economies.\n\n>As Bitcoins market cap grows and monetary inflation drops it appears that we will likely see very low deflation (occasionally people losing some coins) which is perfectly fine because the market will factor those expectations into consideration for loans and debt.\n\nWith more coins in the market, there are more coins to be lost. Each coin has an individual probability of being lost at any time. Thus, you need to be considering a certain % of all Bitcoin that will be lost each day/month/year/etc. With the increasing number of coins on the market, more and more Bitcoin will be lost every year.",

Tx velocity also increases but I'm not focusing on this because some suggest merely more adoption and speculative trading. It is very evident, but you aren't going to get any good studies on it due to the privacy found in bitcoin. \n\n>So if I wanted to redo my kitchen with my newfound Bitcoin wealth, I could spend say $10k worth of Bitcoin (say 10% of my Bitcoin)... or just wait a year until that deflationary currency increases in value and that $10k the next year is now only 5% of my Bitcoin. \n\nMoney is useless unless you can eventually use it. Your suggestion of constant hoarding does not match with my or many other bitcoin users experience. The \"lambo\" meme isn't just a meme but reflects early adopters spending during bull markets and you can see many Nouveau riche spending quite extravagantly. \n\nThe same can be seen with examples in technology products that are constantly dropping in value per model/feature set due to rapid improvements. Are you going to keep putting off buying a new cell phone or laptop because there will always be a much better one in the future or you can always buy last years model for cheaper? No, at most you might delay for a few months but will need to make a purchase eventually. \n\n>Thus, you need to be considering a certain % of all Bitcoin that will be lost each day/month/year/etc\n\nMost bitcoin were lost during the first 2 years when there wasn't good security, backups and bitcoin wasn't worth much. Very few bitcoin are lost these days. We can actually measure this onchain",
