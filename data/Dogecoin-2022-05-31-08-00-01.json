This subsequently increased my net worth by approx. 34 cents.\n\nI\u2019ve now started to think about the tax implications of this. Would this be recorded as a windfall or capital gains? Am I better off speaking to my licensed financial advisor about this? Should I look into putting my 4 doge in a high interest savings account?",

In this case the exchanges which are required to report to jurisdictions they operate in. You put in cash, you buy, you sell, you withdraw cash, governments know about it.\n\nHowever, just like they don\u2019t know about the money you spend on burgers, of the fifty bucks you get for your birthday or something, they don\u2019t know or in fact particularly care, about the crypto you move around.\n\nBesides which, crypto is pseudo-anonymous. Nobody knows who \u2018owns\u2019 any given wallet, unless you out yourself in some way. Which is why I promote having many wallets, and only using any one of them for one entity or purpose. Because when you link wallets, that exposes every transaction past, present and future.\n\nSo just grab your keys from the website, stick them in a text file, and treat your wallet like any other. And if one day someone tips you a million Doge, then just go and spend it and don\u2019t worry about it.",
