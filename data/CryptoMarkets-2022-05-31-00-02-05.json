Couple options from there. Borrow against them but monitor your loan health. Either get more of the asset and deposit it on top so you've now got more than when you've started then use interest and other shit to pay it down. Or borrow stable put into yield farms and use generated assets to compound and pay down your folded loan. You can also do this into stables to btc to cash app to pay rent and other Bill's.",
