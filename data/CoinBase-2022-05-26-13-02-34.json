            "selftext": "Spoke to support today. I only make small transactions on a very limited basis. This is not my first time trading or purchasing crypto with an attached bank account. The funds have cleared from my bank and now I have a hold on the eth I purchased until 5/31/22. This really seems odd to me as the support rep stated that hold times are factored in for possible bank reversals (which i have never processed) and the \"riskiness\" of the account (I've made maybe 10 transactions in the past year). Last time it took three days for the money to clear and i had access to move my crypto to my wallet. With the way eth just dumped it seems suspect to hold a persons crypto for two weeks before allowing moving it off exchange and or swapping it.",

And heres the kicker, I have more than that sitting on the exchange as collateral.  \n\nI have see these clowns go as high as 14 day hold.  \n\nHeres a tip, you can actually see the hold time before hitting the submit button.  If you dont like the time, you can not go through with it.  I had no choice as 10 days was the best I could get.   \n\nI swear these jokers have a liquidity problem and the reason for such long hold times.   The interest they are making on the float should be illegal.  Every time I do a transfer, these coinbase jokers pull the money from my bank within hours or that evening at the latest.",
