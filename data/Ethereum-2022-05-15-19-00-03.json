            "selftext": "We all recall this is a pivotal year for Ethereum layer 2 (L2) solutions so what happens over the coming months will be critical in making decentralized finance (DeFi) work better, faster, and more reliably for a far greater number of users.  \n\nLast year saw L2 solutions roll out with great promise, increasing the number of decentralized apps across verticals such as exchanges, marketplaces, wallets, bridges, and more. Yet the growing user base and total value locked on Ethereum L2 were eclipsed by alternative layer 1 blockchains emerging to fill the market gaps that persisted such as Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues.\n\n   With multiple apps deployed across chains, we are now seeing increasing fragmentation that adds complexity for end-users and detracts from the ultimate goal of making DeFi accessible for all. We have seen chains like smartchain develop cheap, fast and highly efficient solutions which helps launching of projects like Cake, Minosis, Xvs etc even more accesible.  Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has claimed that (L2s or) \u201crollups are in the short and medium-term, and possibly in the long term, the only trustless scaling solution for Ethereum\u201d. \n\n We have seen this start to play out, with the total value locked (TVL) in layer 2 protocols such as StarkNet, Arbitrum, and Boba Network growing from USD 50 million to a high of USD 7 billion.  I look forward to what follows, do you think the L2 will be a total success?",

They show up whenever rollups are being discussed, and it's usually irrelevant as Loopring is still an application-specific rollup which doesn't help the guy trying to do the fun DeFi stuff beyond just trading coins. This 100% would not happen if Loopring didn't have a token and used ETH for its fees, like Arbitrum and Optimism. \n\nI understand they're working on a zkEVM, but until they deliver, Loopring doesn't deserve to be brought up all the time. Partnerships and what not, sure, that's cool and good for Loopring, but that's very rarely what the discussion is actually about when someone brings up LRC. It's just vague claims of it being the future of everything when there's EVM-compatible solutions working today.\n\nBut yes, nothing against Loopring per se. If they do deliver on a zkEVM then that'll actually be super cool and *then* it'll be worth to bring it up when people complain about gas fees being too expensive to play around with dapps, and I'll most likely bring it up myself as well.",

Polygon has acquired a number of companies building rollups, but again, no firm progress.\n\nMeanwhile:\n\n* Arbitrum has been running for almost a year and has tons of usage\n* Optimism has also been running for a while, and is chasing Arbitrum's lead\n* StarkNet has been in mainnet-beta for months, the bridge went live last week, and we'll start seeing usage soon\n* ZKSync has a testnet for their V2 running now, so mainnet should be soon\n* Aztec has been running in production for over a year, mind you not a general-purpose rollup, but a fully private rollup is pretty cool by itself and will compete with projects like Monero and ZCash\n\nThe one thing that none of those projects have (yet) is a token.

This is because you need some sort of bridging mechanism to facilitate cross-chain communication.  If you have a dapp with governance that has to span n chains, that all need to communicate each other, you're gonna need at least n bridges.  This increases the attack surface and number of things that can go wrong.  Even the side chains like Polygon that use Ethereum for security/finality, still rely on another set validators to operate a bridge for assets.  Some bridges are even completely centralized.  I'm hoping there's some better solution in the future (or maybe an existing solution I haven't heard of)",
