I can do what we\u2019ve been doing for a long time and transfer ownership of a lot of gold very quickly, where the actual gold is held on deposit in a secure vault.   There\u2019s no real need to move the actual physical gold around, as long as we can securely transfer ownership.   And we figured out how to do that several hundred years ago.  <shrug>\n\nIf I want to, I can go pick up the actual physical gold and do whatever I want with it.  But I don\u2019t have to.",

Especially if you're online posting you have 1, 5, 10, 20, or 1000+ bitcoin. That's a fact. because people with fiat are targeted through elaborate schemes all the time.  Even now there are schemes for crypto (send one get two back, phishing links, etc). Post your 20 bitcoin wallet and watch the DMS come in.  Maybe you're smart and you won't fall for anything.  A lot of people will and do fall for this crap...\n\nThen comes confiscation, what if one day your bitcoin gets confiscated as gold did.  No one can confiscate what you don't have... just a thought without elaborating on that too much lol\n\nIn the end, you really have no benefit in telling people how much bitcoin or fiat you have unless it's an ego thing and you're just trynna flex. \n\nI understand people get excited online and wanna tell someone but that's why people warn people to be alert about it.\n\nThe benefits of not saying anything outweigh the negatives of publically disclosing.\n\nPeople like Elon and Saylor aren't dumb and they have a lot more resources to protect their wealth than average people here posting about becoming whole coiners.. or quarter coines..etc...My 2 sats on that...lol",
