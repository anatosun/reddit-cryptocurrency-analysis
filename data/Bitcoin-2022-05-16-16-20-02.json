That's not exactly a head spinning, day winning argument in court.\n\n[https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2019/SF0125](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2019/SF0125)\n\nAs noted, there are different forms of custody that can be performed there under a custody agreement, either by use of private keys (possibly where the exchange fully manages), or by multisignature, or by smart contract (see the details in the law cited above).\n\nNo other State in the United States of America other than Wyoming (and I think, there is no other country as well) has laws where, if the exchange is licensed under those laws, your bitcoin is somehow recognized as legally yours when it's on that exchange.  **None**.  There are some states that are working on it (based on the efforts that Wyoming made), but expect a lot more notices like Coinbase's in the meanwhile (remember, where Coinbase recently stated in its own report that \"the crypto assets we hold in custody on behalf of our customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings,\" and that users of Coinbase will become \"general unsecured creditors..\" - I've seen at least one other company use this exact language recently and there will be more since, while there are a good number of crypto companies operating in Wyoming, it's still a fairly new area and many crypto companies are instead operating in the inferior legal system which is to say outside Wyoming).  This is also true, as you know, of nearly every typical bank model, not only of crypto exchanges that operate in standard U.S. state legal structures that haven't yet upgraded to Wyoming similar law.\n\nAs exchanges move to acquire banks or become licensed as bank or bank-like organizations (which is happening, and that's the main point here - there is no sense in ignoring it or pretending that it isn't happening since not only is it happening, it will be better than having the traditional banks be in total control of the economy), there is no sense in them doing so unless they recognize that the clients have ownership of the assets when those assets are on the platform.  Otherwise confidence in those exchanges simply decreases and people will no longer use them (and I would argue will eventually shift to exchanges where ownership IS recognized).",

And will just transfer them to other brokerages. Ideally this will protect investors. There is however several ways brokers can sell your stocks without permission, so it will be interesting what loopholes exist in wyoming for kraken to sell your crypto or not actually have it when you buy it.\nThis is a good first step though",

No, it wouldn't allow things to be sold / loaned without your permission, and it would treat the underlying keys as your property, but that's definitely different than the way stocks work.  In the case of the WY SPDI, rehypothecation is avoided (prohibited), the only exception I can think of in the law is that the customer can grant the WY SPDI licensed firm limited permissions to do so since the law states, \"A bank shall not authorize or permit rehypothecation of digital assets under this section. The bank shall not engage in any activity to use or exercise discretionary authority relating to a digital asset except based on customer instructions.\"  My reading of both the law and the rules they've adopted to implement the law in Wyoming for this indicates that the customer can authorize the WY SPDI to engage in a limited range of lending of the digital asset, but the parameters of that are quite limited (as I understood it, it was intended to limit risk to whatever crypto-fiat banks might be approved). \n\nYou mentioned Fidelity, which made me think of Fidelity Charitable which accepts bitcoin and possibly now other digital assets.  However,  strictly speaking it isn't Wyoming licensed (which brings us back to the concern over legal ownership of funds in custody).  Fidelity Charitable offers a DAF (donor advised fund), and there are other orgs that accept / integrate bitcoin that also offer the DAF opportunity.  \n\nOf note, under current Wyoming and federal law,\r  \n\r  \n*- A Trust Department of the WY SPDI can house charitable accounts.*\r  \n*- A charitable remainder trust can be within the WY SPDI (this sort of use case depends on the exchange or licensed company as to whether it would be set up that way).*\r  \n*- A Donor Advised Fund (DAF) can provide up to 30 percent AGI deduction and no tax on invested income.*\r  \n\r  \nExamples of DAFs that accept crypto are provided via [Fidelity](https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/giving-account/giving-account-details.html) and [Endaoment](https://www.endaoment.org/), although I think that WY SPDI licensed organizations (such as [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/learn/finance/spdi-bank-charter), [Custodia](https://custodiabank.com/) (formerly named Avanti), [Commercium](https://commerciumbank.com/), and [Wyoming Deposit and Transfer Corporation](https://wdtfinancial.com/organizational-status)) would be better because they are in fact directly SPDI licensed in Wyoming whereas Fidelity isn't (last I checked) nor is Endaoment (note:  the method by which funds can be received by nonprofits who ultimately benefit via Endaoment's system [is shown here](https://docs.endaoment.org/organizations/receiving-endaoment-grants), it does not involve bitcoin, whereas Fidelity's DAF system does involve bitcoin as an option.)  \n\nHopefully that answers some of your questions around this topic.",
