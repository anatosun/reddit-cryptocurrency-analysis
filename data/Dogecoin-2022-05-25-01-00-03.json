I think one could speculate 2024-2025 during the Artemis 3 mission that might catch the alt season of the next cycle. I am actually excited for this mission as it is the first moon landing since 1972 and may have female crew member and be the first women on the moon. You can use doge right now through wallets and there is projects being worked on such as radio doge and libdogecoin",
