I see them proccesing in transaction history, but since 1st of April 2021 they haven't arrived in my binance account. I've tried contacting binance through binance support chat explaining the problem and attaching the confirmation of the bank transfer, but haven't received any adequate answer, only something automated.\n\nDo I have any chance to get in touch with someting who can help me...any email, phone number, anything??",
