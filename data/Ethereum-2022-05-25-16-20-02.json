There would not be many connections between those two groups of clients. So once an older client proposes a block, it's seen and attested to by other older clients. Eventually a large enough group of newer clients comes to a consensus and transmits it through the network to override the block produced by the older client. This produces the reorg.

Bitcoin had quite a long reorg after a change called BIP66. They had a 95% threshold, but one pool, BTCNuggets, wasn't upgraded. BTCNuggets produced a block which broke the new rule introduced in BIP66. Upgraded miners rejected that block and any block built on top of it, causing a reorg. What made it worse on that occasion was that some pools were skipping validation to save time so less than 95% of the hashrate was enforcing the new rule even though 95% had signalled for it, and we ended up with a 6 block reorg, ie a full hour of history was created then erased.\n\nThe difference between a soft fork and a hard fork is that whereas a soft fork makes a block which was valid on the old rules invalid on the new rules, a hard fork makes a block which was invalid on the old rules valid on the new rules. This means that if you have an unupgraded *validating* node it'll still stay on the correct chain after a soft fork, whereas with a hard fork it'll refuse to follow the longest chain with the new rules and stick with a chain that follows the old rules. But if a *mining* node doesn't know what the new validity rules are, it'll obviously make invalid blocks.",

Only then is the execution chain reliant on the beacon chain, so only then do beacon chain reorgs cause execution chain reorgs.\n\n> Imagine being the guy who placed the buy order just before the price of something spiked, you start high fiving your bros and then two minutes later, your transaction gets reordered and your buy order goes in after the price spike, not before it.

Either your transaction is front-runnable or it isn't - two minutes of reorg isn't any more useful to a miner than the standard 15 second MEV window between each and every block. This is why dexes have slippage limits (transaction fails if price changes too much before the transaction is included). If you use a sane slippage limit, the situation you described is impossible anyways, as the limit would cancel your transaction.\n\n> It would basically break DeFi.\n\nI think that's really overselling it.\n\nIt's not great news, but it's already fixed in newer client versions, and it's isolated to the beacon chain right now where no real damage can be caused. Plus, it looks to be caused by outdated software, so the problem should fix itself as people update their beacon chain clients. They will be forced to update their clients before the merge anyways, so I believe there is naturally no way this particular issue could ever actually cause any real transactions to revert.",

If there's anything about it you don't understand, I'm pretty familiar with the specification and would be happy to answer questions to the best of my ability.\n\nEthereum's beacon chain is roughly the same level of complexity as any other PoS protocol. Unless - are you saying that you're a PoW maximalist, and you believe that all blockchains should always use PoW, and no blockchain should ever use any type of PoS?\n\n> Maybe this bug is fixed before it became a problem, but post-merge, there would have been significant repercussions if this happened.\n\nThis is exactly what the testnets are for. Yes, I consider the pre-merge beacon chain to be an incentivized testnet.\n\nPlus, post-merge, stakers would have had strong incentives to prevent this from happening because it would have reverted the execution chain too.\n\n> dead simple PoW\n\nThe current Ethereum chain is not \"dead simple\". While it's true that PoW itself is \"dead simple,\" PoW is only a small component of the existing chain - you can thank the EVM for large amounts of complexity that have led to issues in the past. Even Bitcoin hasn't been immune to consensus bugs - see the value overflow incident and the database fork incident, both of which had a much larger on-chain impact than reverting two minutes of consensus messages on an incentivized testnet.\n\n> completely untested in the wild\n\nBeacon chain PoS is being tested in the wild right now, since December 2020. That's what this is. The pre-merge beacon chain isn't here just for decoration.\n\n> hyper complex PoS\n\nWhat part of it do you not understand? I think it's frankly somewhat lame that you hand wave PoS away with phrases like \"hyper complex\" and \"absurd complexity\" when in reality it's actually a pretty elegant system. Do you want me to link you to an ELI5 on how it works? Do you want me to explain the ethresearch post on this and how it was mitigated in new client releases?",

Ethereum has been forward about their pro-hard-fork stance since the network's inception, and the difficulty bomb underpins that ethos - if ETH doesn't undergo a hard fork for a certain amount of time, the chain literally destroys itself. This feature was included in 2015 when Ethereum was launched.\n\nI really wonder whether, with your viewpoints, you might feel more at home with a different cryptocurrency, as those viewpoints run counter to the basic philosophy that the Ethereum dev team has been practicing since launch.\n\nA sampling of Ethereum's many hard forks:\n\n* Tangerine Whistle and Spurious Dragon defended the network against DoS attacks\n\n* Byzantium added opcodes to support Layer 2 networks\n\n* Constantinople added Create2 to support counterfactual contracts\n\n* Istanbul added BLAKE2 \n\n* Berlin added access lists, for contract call optimization\n\n* London added elastic block sizing to help the network deal with bursts in demand\n\nEach of these forks also tweaked opcode pricing, which is very important and can only be done via a hard fork. Basically, Ethereum has undergone many hard forks to tweak parameters, add new features and modify opcodes - the expressiveness of the EVM really necessitates it.\n\n>blockchains seem to get away with it because no one actually cares if it works and builds trust long term\n\nEthereum's hard forks build long term trust. Without these hard forks, Ethereum would be missing many of the features we take for granted today, and a competing network likely would have overtaken it.\n\nGiven your viewpoints, I really wonder what you find attractive enough about Ethereum to bring you to this point of discussion. It seems to me that according to your viewpoints on what a cryptocurrency should be, Ethereum fundamentally doesn't fit the bill - like you're trying to make Ethereum into something that it's never been.",

I\u2019m surprised it took so long. \n\nLet me put it this way - I\u2019ve been in the Ethereum ecosystem in one way or another since the very beginning. Back then it no one thought it would take 7 years to get to the point where we are. There was a lot less big money floating around then and a lot more people who understood the fundamentals of what made crypto special. It seemed well understood back then that the hard forks shouldn\u2019t go on forever. No one thought they\u2019d have to. \n\nIn all that time we\u2019ve seen many shitcoins come and go. Too complex in most cases, typically with founders and dev teams that just couldn\u2019t let go, stop tinkering and just let it harden. They\u2019d get exploited one way or another or ASICs would take over their networks and make them insecure. \n\nSo here we are what, 8 years later, and Ethereum has arguably the most decentralized mining and has proven nearly immune to basic attacks. Exactly what you\u2019d want as a foundation. Where it fails isn\u2019t at the protocol level, it\u2019s typically in poorly tested, too complex dapps. And somehow that mentality has seeped into the protocol level and at this point the developers seem intent to bring that level of uncertainty and vulnerability to the very foundation. And at this point anyone that speaks out against that gets silenced and shooed away and told they don\u2019t belong, just like you\u2019re doing right now. \n\nSo yeah, on some level you\u2019re right. I\u2019m not too happy about what it\u2019s become and where it\u2019s headed. It hasn\u2019t always been this way. To be honest every time I see PoS fail in one way or another I\u2019m happy to see it. If I\u2019m being honest, I hope something so catastrophic happens pre-merge that even the most die hard PoS and hard fork acolyte needs to take a step back and reconsider whether it\u2019s worth it. Its running out, but there\u2019s still time to save it before it\u2019s too late.",
