The payment network itself makes the cost of doing this near zero because you don\u2019t need your customers to switch out what they\u2019re using.\n\nIn Jack\u2019s perfect world, he manages all the merchant nodes with Strike, takes a very small fee to make it seem pointless to move away, and continues having a Bitcoin profit generating business with near zero maintenance costs.\n\nHis solution to instantly swap dollars with Bitcoin is actually his largest utility advantage and probably remains the only reason these companies don\u2019t just integrate with lightning themselves.

I can see people risking their BTC on nodes now to contribute to the development/liquidity of the network but if the LN is going to be used for payments, people will need to keep most of their BTC on the LN to keep it liquid and avoid future base layer access delays. Will people will be incentivised to \"deposit\" their BTC on nodes and get returns that are propotionate to the risk? I have an Umbrel node with LN and haven't set up funded channels yet but admittedly have not put much time into it.",
