To my great dismay, the actual cryptography and anarchist movement in Bitcoin, and crypto in general, has been completely and totally pushed aside by the rise of retail- a trend that was noticeable in 2017 but an especially prominent theme in 2021.\n\nHowever, as someone who doesn't necessarily agree with the proscribed solutions Austrians offer (completely unregulated free markets tend to concentrate power and then reward concentrated power disproportionately for example) I still fully believe and will defend the core idea that fiat monetary policy and central banking has very much the same effect in practice. As long as central banks can manipulate the money supply, they will concentrate power into their friends hands. To this end, the crypto ideals of decentralization, democratic governance, fair representation, and immutable ledgers have massive implications for resolving those problems. I think in the grand scheme of things however, I'm like a caveman watching an Indo-Iranian hunter fashion a wheel and fix it to a platform to make a chariot and imagining the possibility of humans building spaceships from this technology. It's so infant that currently none of what I hope is possible is yet possible. But the idea that it _might be_ is definitely heartening.",

Certain industry's such as defense materials it makes sense to force diversification but for a lot of others it may just be the best company.

They fail to acknowledge prisoner dilemma style situations where profit motivations work against the common good without sufficient trust and cooperation.\n\nI agree that we need a fixed supply global money and I agree that this will enable free markets to *better* allocate capital to projects that will *actually* benefit society and provide for real needs. But there's more work to be done thinking about just what kind of government should sit on top of an Austrian monetary policy.\n\nEvery law is in essence an extension of monetary policy. Speeding tickets are a highly specific law that financially punishes dangerous behavior. If you create a sliding scale fine based on the drivers net worth it can better incentivize all people to drive safely regardless of wealth status. Or should it be based on their yearly salary instead? Or is there second and third order consequences of this we aren't considering?\n\nNo economy is simple enough to claim that the base layer money will function properly. You can easily make laws that over or under punish economies. Imagine a 20% sales tax for example. These rules drastically change the efficiency and real wealth generated by a society and could easily stamp out any benefits of an Austrian monetary policy.\n\nMany Austrians think a complete removal of taxation would solve all of these problems. However, there are efficiencies to be had by some form of group funding mechanisms and without some kind of forced participation you will have altruistic people lifting the weight for selfish people. This first leads to the wrong people gaining wealth (by hoarding and not helping fund public goods) and eventually leads to a collapse of the funding system when trust is destroyed.\n\nNow obviously none of this directly attacks Austrian theory. At most it's a complaint that followers of the theory attribute too much strength to its automatic affect on society. **I would like to see more energy put into presenting actual forms of government that would function well on top of Austrian Economics.**",

On the flip side, I also really enjoy Robert Breedlove's philosophy and dissection of money (even though I see him as a bit incomplete on the post Austrian Economics governance side of things).\n\nA lot of Libertarians like John Vallis have this \"Governance Islands\" theory and it's probably the best response I've found for governance post Austrian Economics. However, as Peter alludes to in his responses there's a missing game theory analysis for being able to freely choose what governance structure you live under.\n\nSome issues that arise:\n\n1. Those who are self sufficient and wealthy will flock to low taxation governance islands which do not adequately protect the bottom of society. This continues to require altruistic wealthy individuals to remain in islands that do not optimally serve them financially.\n2. High paying jobs will migrate to islands which best support businesses and low taxation will greatly benefit them. This creates a situation where both affluence and the jobs required to generate affluence consolidate and segregate away from the poor.\n3. To avoid increasing taxation in affluent islands, you will see local altruism emerge to maintain infrastructure as to avoid developing a lower class dependent on them. This will create really well run islands of affluence, but will remain exclusionary.\n\nThere are other issues as well I could go into but these are the main game theoretic issues I see with governance islands with open migration. If you can't afford to move into an island, open migration only serves the wealthy.",

Modern state-entangled enterprises like oil companies or MIC are closer to mafia than to entrepreneurs\n\nTrust and cooperation is needed for the involved parties of a business for profit. It does not require trust and cooperation with the broader needs of society.\n\nMafia rule is a form of governance. You're kind of making my point that the form of governance on top of any monetary policy will greatly affect how well profit aligns with public good.\n\n>As powerless as possible\n\nThis is where Austrians seem to stop.

Your \"public good\" can be my \"public bad\", value scales are ordinal, shifting and often incompatible. Bitcoin is an excellent example of roughest capitalist endeavor\n\nI concede this point in the context of modern day notions of taxation. Some ideas I have that attempt to address this issue and the feeling of extortion that comes from taxation:\n\n1. Have a public voting system where people vote on the tax rate (take the average of what people collectively think the tax rate should be).\n2. You have a say in the tax rate, but once it's established you are still subject to the same rate as everyone else (even if that's more than your specific vote).\n3. The government continues having full control over spending budgets for 90% (somewhat arbitrary number) of tax revenue.\n4. 10% (again, arbitrary) then goes into a fund where private companies or individuals can present plans to build infrastructure, run programs, or argue for increased funding to specific programs already handled by the government (say, education).\n5. Individuals can vote, or delegate their vote to a public figure, for where their portion of that 10% goes specifically.\n6. Over time, slowly decrease the percent going to the government and increase the percent of taxation going to the publicly delegated fund.\n7. Over time, you find out to what degree you need a central government doing the planning and funding decisions. Perhaps they can be eliminated (doubt it very much). Perhaps they are only needed for foreign affairs and the military.\n\n**This is what I mean by providing more than just \"Austrian economics fixes everything.\"** Give me your version of my plan above, or explain how no government or opt in taxation actually works from a game theory perspective.",

You can only vote to increase or decrease the tax rate for each tax bracket.\n2. The tax rate of change per year would be capped to something like 3% to the downside and 6% to the upside (faster to raise tax rate with large agreement, slower to decrease it).\n\nThis would keep governments mostly solvent on existing budget agreements and give them time to turn things around before the people totally strip their budget away.

Bear in mind that I am from Argentina a country which is grossly over taxed and my perspective is very different from people from countries with more reasonable tax rates.\n\nHey no worries I'm always interested in taking in views from other parts of the world, especially countries like Argentina where both the governments monetary policy and the global consequences of the US dollar reserve status weigh down on the economy.\n\n>I was not really against the idea if it meant it was a flat tax for all society, if there are brackets I really can\u2019t get behind it.\n\nI'd be curious to hear more about why this is such a distinguishing factor. Do you see an inherent flaw in taxing wealthier individuals at a higher rate? Or is it the worry that these ratios would become overly regressive given the majority might vote against a minority wealth class?\n\nI actually don't have a strong reason to keep tax brackets so I don't actually mind throwing them out all that much (especially since cheap debt is the largest concern for unfair wealth disparity).\n\n>I believe that if taxation was optional there would be a much bigger discussion around what those taxes would be used for the budget of the country would be front and center of those elections, however there would be so many disparities between the needs and wants of different sections of society that in the end people would rather not pay for some thing they would not use so it would be impossible to agree on a taxation rate.\n\nYou describe here exactly why taxation cannot be optional. Instead, giving people the ability to raise and lower taxation (and therefore funding for the government) would accomplish the same goal (forcing politicians to address how they would optimally deploy tax revenue for public good).\n\n>So people would find private market alternatives for the things they need instead of public funding that would result in them only paying for what they need and not for what other people need, and people will always choose to pay less to the government. Even if people thought that there were people in need who would benefit from higher taxes if they had to pay less taxes they could use their spare money to help those people without forcing people who wouldn\u2019t have them to help them.\n\nThis is exactly why I suggested moving a small (at first) portion of the tax revenue into a separate fund which private companies, institutions, or individuals can apply for funding (or promote extra funding for programs like education). Voters can then specify exactly where their piece of this separate tax fund goes (or they can delegate the decision to a public figure they trust and respect).\n\nYou start off small here, then allow people to vote on expanding or contracting this society delegated funding system. It would function in direct competition with the governments ability to allocate capital. The citizens would then decide which system was working better and give it more of the tax revenue.\n\nSo people can vote on:\n\n1. The tax rate.\n2. The percent of tax revenue going to centralized government versus crowd selected funding of specific programs.\n3. The specific crowd selected programs they want their tax revenue to go towards (assuming others fund the same thing to get it fully funded).\n\nI'm sure there's more to pick apart here\u2013feel free to do so.",

Have a say in the amount of taxation.\n2. Have a say in at least some portion of where that tax revenue goes.\n\nEDIT: I should add, yes to a certain extent this has nothing to do with Austrian economics. If you haven't already I would go back and read where this whole thread started. In my first post I explain that my criticism is largely with Austrian Economists (rather than the theory itself) and their common beliefs around \"taxation is theft\" and their vague notions that we don't need government (or can have some kind of open migration islands of governments that somehow don't impact each other with competing policies that cater to the wealthy).",

At the very start I was careful to mention this was a critique not of Austrian economics but of the economists themselves, often libertarian in their mindset.\n\nI\u2019m a Bitcoiner for a reason\u2013I believe a fixed supply money is the foundation for a market to be able to respond accurately to price signals in order to meet the true demand for goods and services. I believe saving should be possible without investing. I agree with the general premise that a market can only really be thought about from the perspective of many subjective market participants, though a game theoretic approach to hypothetical individual economic positions is also relevant when analyzing a system or government.\n\nAs for the claim that history has largely been living under a fixed supply currency, I will push back on this a bit. The dollar is not the longest lasting fiat currency because the others were based on sound Austrian fixed supply money. Whether backed by gold or some other means they were all centralized and exploited by various debt schemes. We have never experienced something like Bitcoin as a truly fixed supply currency. I agree that it will fix a lot of bad incentives in the system.\n\nIt\u2019s the libertarians who take Austrian economics and try to claim that truly free markets will fix all bad incentives I take issue with\u2013going as far as to say \u201call taxation is theft\u201d. If you are in that camp then we are in disagreement and our mission with Bitcoin does not go in the same direction after it\u2019s first leg.\n\nI agree the madness with our current monetary theory is the first issue to focus on with our direct actions, but this does not mean we can just wave our hands and say, \u201cjust adopt Bitcoin and get rid of governments and the world will function off the glory of the free market!\u201d Doing so hurts the direct message. We need a vision for the future which solves for the new monetary system rather than just trying to topple the old one.",

At the same time (1930s) the Communists in Russia were appearing to enjoy rapid industrial growth through their central planning Marxist program. Western governments adopted some socialist policies via Keynesian mechanisms creating work schemes and some welfare. This appeared to work and to appease the masses then WW2 occurred and thereafter the world was divided between the Soviet Bloc and the west. Economic theories tend to view the world as a static model whereas reality and technology is constantly changing. Austrian economics sees the free market as ideal but may fail to account for anti-competitive tendencies and the need to regulate them. Communist central planning seemed to work well in a crude early stage of industrialisation but failed to match free markets as technology developed. As we now enter the post industrial digital economy who knows how the various new forces will interact with the various economic model ideologies? Bitcoin seems like it is at least one strand of the developing digital era of algorithmic economic progression. Chinas central command mercantilism has successfully reverse engineered the Wests industrial models and now seeks to reverse engineer if not re engineer completely the global institutional and regulatory protocols and frameworks...the monetary system being the ultimate prize of empire. Whose face is on that coin? To he you pay tax! Ultimately the economic theories which enable the greatest capture of resources and wealth must change with the technology that drives wealth creation. In short stack Sats and hope for the best but also plan for the worst.",

While it is true there is no real objective measure of aims, it is false that it cannot be quantitatively measured by a prospective entrepreneur. The way to quantify it is to measure the relative subjective importance and satisfaction of each aim across a large population. Statistical methods are the key to predictable innovation. \n\nBut yeah, other than that the theory is sound AFAIK",

I guess I read the second line you mention as an observation and not a statement of fact.\n\nIn fact, one of the criticisms of Marx that Bohm-Bawerk brought up was this this misunderstanding of the relationship of the cost of labor with regards to subjective valuation.\n\nFor example, the capitalist takes on the risks of bringing a product to market that the consumer either may not want or is not ready for. There may be inconsistent demand, for example, which means that production of a good might not always be worth the cost, either in resources or in labor. But the capitalist takes on this risk in inconsistent demand so that the laborer does not have to. The laborer in exchange gets a consistent wage.\n\nImagine a world where laborers make the same products over and over and never innovate. That's the world that Marx wrote Das Kapital for. He never really truly embraced the idea of [ordinal utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_utility) which we know humans use as way to determine value.",

This was how the company scrips and stores came about.  IE people filled the gaps created by backed money with unbacked money.\n\nOf course in modern day with most of us having lived our the majority if not the entirety of our lives on a fiat system where the hidden taxation of inflation makes us feel like hamsters on a tread mill, sound money sounds really good, and even if bitcoin did not solve many of the issues that give rise to unbacked fiat, I'd still be in favor of trying it the other way having lived with and being disappointed with the inflationary unbacked system throughout my life.\n\nI recognize the prior problems with Austrian models, but with better currency that solves the divisibility and transport issues, Austrian models are certainly more sound.",
