But the money vanishing after contacting them, surprise trade fees, and duplicate bank deposits NOT reflecting in my crypto balance is not ideal. Just writing everything that happened to see if this is the case for anyone else. Posting on here for help/insight.\n\n**LONG POST. But please read.**\n\nI obviously would like the funds returned to my account. This all happened in April when \\~6,000 other users had their accounts wiped and refunded\u2026 **emailed CB in April 2021**... and May, June, July, etc. Also opened additional support tickets on a regular basis due to emails being ignored and  tickets closed without ANY response. At the end of April, I couldnt get into my CB or CBP account. Was logged out and when I tried to login it said \"Rate Limits Exceeded.\"Soon after contacting CB to inform them that something was wrong with my account... my CB/CBP were locked down. Kept trying to get in touch with them to regain access, but no response from-- no notification saying that they locked my account down or anything. Couldn't even login. Couldn't see funds on API. Nothing.\n\n**Did not receive any non-automated reply until NOVEMBER 2021.**\n\nWas locked out of my account and couldn\u2019t get back in until the END of November.\u00a0Everything is gone AND I owe thousands of  dollars. All my investments are missing. I\u2019ve sent all required info in November after no response for months and we are still keep going around in circles. \u00a0\n\nAlways kept accounts secure, used 2FA (non-SMS), and monitored my crypto on a daily basis\u2026 tracking all trades, P&L, and etc. I built that account up with thousands of hours of trading and studying\u2026 and it\u2019s no longer there. Just randomly\u2026 account was locked... and SEVERAL months later, with no response from support, all my money was gone.\u00a0\n\n**------------**\n\n**Total missing on my account:**\n\n**- Balance that has vanished - $60,919!**\n\n**- Duplicate deposits on my bank account that cleared but did not reflect on crypto balance- $28,469!**\n\n**- \u201cFree\u201d (AS ADVERTISED IN APP) conversions that incurred fees listed in transaction history download - $11,918.69!**\n\n**TOTAL: $101,306.69\u2013 which at current rates, would be near DOUBLE!**\u00a0\n\n**------------**\n\nI've even requested SEVERAL TIMES for an address to send legal documents with no response when requested\u2014 this has taken over a year of my life away and induced extreme anxiety not knowing where a large portion of my life savings went when I was confident that it was safe utilizing 2FA and having CB \"support team.\" During the 8 months I ended up having significant damage to my life, health, and well being not knowing where my life savings was and if I\u2019d ever see it again. My attorney and I looked through all the info and compiled it in a spreadsheet with official documents/records which I sent over SEVERAL TIMES. **IGNORED.**\n\n**It\u2019s MAY 2022 and I haven\u2019t had any access to the money I\u2019ve had in my accounts since April 2021.**\u00a0\n\n1. **Let\u2019s start first with the $11,918.69 in fees charged for free conversions (as advertised in app).** When I downloaded the transaction history, it listed fees charged for the \u201cfree trade/swaps\u201d within the CB application. Can this be refunded? I sent over the transaction and trade history and highlighted these transactions. **IGNORED.**\n2. **Next, there are the duplicate bank deposits.** That was also attached and shown via my banking information history compared to the CB transaction history in the excel sheet WITH OFFICIAL BANKING DEPOSIT FORMS. **Exactly $28,469. IGNORED.**\n3. **Why did all my Bitcoin and crypto get liquidated when my account was compromised?** **I had $60,919 in crypto**, I emailed, let CB know to look into it and lock my account in April, requested that it be converted to USD, and followed up countless times asking about my balance\u2026 no response until November 2021\u2014 that\u2019s +8 whole months. I sent over all the requested info. **IGNORED.**\n4. **A few deposits were made from my bank account totaling $24k.** I did not approve this nor did I have access to the account when this happened. It partially filled, the rest bounced. All crypto was liquidated. Now I owe a balance? These deposits, as well as/separate from the other duplicate deposits ($28,469) that did not reflect in my bank account points to potential glitch in the CBP deposits? The rest of my balance liquidated to pay CB back but should of had the $60k still in the account... yet I could not login due to \"Rate Limits Exceeded\" message EVERYTIME I tried to login. After a while my entire account was locked out.\n\nI just need my money back, to no longer have to send email after email, and to stop going around in circles.\u00a0Open tickets, respond to tickets, get ignored, tickets closed with no response, etc. Only received THREE responses in the past year.\n\n**Please see attached 3 responses I received throughout this process after many tickets, emails, and followups. Finally received 1st response on 11/12/2021 since first contact on 04/2021.** \n\n**REQUESTED THAT ACCOUNT BE LOCKED IN APRIL... AUTOMATED ACCOUNT RECOVERY EMAIL RECEIVED AUGUST 10, 2021. ACCOUNT WAS NOT PROTECTED IN TIMELY MANNER. NO HUMAN RESPONSE VIA EMAIL FROM 04/29/21 UNTIL 11/12/21. THATS ALMOST 8 MONTHS.**\n\n**-------------------------------------------------**\n\n**FIRST RESPONSE ON 11/12/2021- MONTHS AFTER INITIAL REQUEST ON 04/2021:**\n\nHello *{redacted},*,\n\nThanks for your patience as we investigate this issue.\u00a0\n\nIn order to better understand what happened, please answer the following questions at your earliest convenience:\n\n\\* Was the device in your possession during the unauthorized activity?\n\n\\* Had\u00a0you been in touch with any customer service representative via phone or social media before or during the activity?\u00a0If so, please provide us with the phone number or URL.\n\n\\* Had\u00a0you suffered any noticeable interruption in your phone service or been a victim of a phone port/sim swap?\n\n\\* Had\u00a0you received any unrequested email or SMS message from Coinbase that prompted you to click a link and enter your login credentials? If so, please send us a screenshot of that message so we can take a look.\n\n\\* Did you use or had\u00a0installed any remote desktop software around the time of the activity?\n\n\\* Had you recently installed any software or browser\u2019s extension? If so, could you run a malware scan on your device and let us know the results?\n\n\\* Can you provide any further information about how your credentials could have been compromised?\n\nKind regards,Coinbase Support\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**-------------------------------------------------**\n\n**My response only a FEW HOURS AFTER their FIRST RESPONSE TO ME SINCE APRIL:**\n\nThank you\u00a0for the reply. Please see responses\u00a0below:\n\n\\* Was the device in your possession during the unauthorized activity?\u00a0\n\nA:Yes. Goes wherever I go.\u00a0\n\n\\* Had\u00a0you been in touch with any customer service representative via phone or social media before or during the activity?\u00a0If so, please provide us with the phone number or URL.\u00a0\n\nA:No, never.\n\n\\* Had\u00a0you suffered any noticeable interruption in your phone service or been a victim of a phone port/sim swap?\u00a0\n\nA:No, I do not believe so. I have AT&T.\n\n\\* Had\u00a0you received any unrequested email or SMS message from Coinbase that prompted you to click a link and enter your login credentials? If so, please send us a screenshot of that message so we can take a look.\u00a0\n\nA:I do receive scam looking emails that look like CB emails... I always check the actual senders address and delete if not directly from CB.\n\n\\* Did you use or had\u00a0installed any remote desktop software around the time of the activity? Remote desktop, as in virtual control?\u00a0\n\nA:No, not that I am aware of. The only things I connected to my Coinbase Account were Coinigy, 3Commas, and Coin Stats. NONE of those were given withdrawal/deposit permissions.\u00a0\n\n\\* Had you recently installed any software or browser\u2019s extension? If so, could you run a malware scan on your device and let us know the results?\u00a0\n\nA:I will do this now. But no extensions used on secure browser.\n\n\\* Can you provide any further information about how your credentials could have been compromised?\u00a0\n\nA:I am unsure.\u00a0\n\nI just know that I randomly got completely locked out, a bunch of bank deposit attempts were made (+$30k that I never initiated), and I contacted you in April/May and heard nothing back until now. Everything is completely gone.\u00a0\n\nStill, to this date, when I try to login in tells me the \"Rate limits have been exceeded...\" and it has still been several MONTHS since I have been able to login.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, I was charged $12k in \"FREE CONVERSIONS\" and have found almost $30k in duplicate bank deposits that never reflected in CB balance... I've attached the excel file with all bank deposits vs CB deposits, fees that were put on \"free\" transactions, and most of my/my attorney's analysis while looking into this. Hoping we can get this resolved. Thanks! Have a blessed day!\n\n**-------------------------------------------------**\n\n**11/15:**\n\n*Hi {redacted},*\n\n*Thanks for contacting us. It appears your account is restricted due to reversed transactions with your bank and an outstanding balance owed to Coinbase. We understand that your account may have been compromised and unauthorized activity occurred. Customers are responsible for the security of their devices and passwords, and for any activity that occurs when those devices or passwords are compromised. Please read our security page for more information:* [*https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1447997*](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1447997)\n\n*We recognize the difficult position this puts you in. However, we cannot reimburse or credit you for this outstanding balance owed to Coinbase because once digital currency is purchased or sent off the platform, we are unable to reverse these transactions.*\n\n*Please note: For Coinbase to consider restoring the purchasing ability for your Coinbase account in the future, you will first need to first resolve the outstanding balance owed to Coinbase.*\n\n*However, if\u00a0you would like to file a formal complaint with Coinbase, please contact us by using this form:*\u00a0[*https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/emails/new?t=793660*](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/emails/new?t=793660)*.For more details, visit our help page here:*\u00a0[*https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2944385-how-to-send-a-complaint-uk-and-eu-only-?b\\_id=13521*](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2944385-how-to-send-a-complaint-uk-and-eu-only-?b_id=13521)*.*\n\n*Regards,Coinbase Support\\*\\*\ud83d\udcf7*\n\n**-------------------------------------------------**\n\n**My response only a FEW HOURS AFTER their SECOND RESPONSE TO ME SINCE APRIL:**\n\nYes, I understand that. I did not make those deposits. I was unable to access my account when those were made. The issue here is all of the funds that disappeared from my account, the unauthorized free trade fees in Coinbase, and the total disappearance of all funds in Coinbase Pro account.\u00a0\n\n\\- All if the crypto was removed from my account. Over 1.5 btc. Everything was liquidated and disappeared.\u00a0\n\n\\- $13k in \u201cfree\u201d trade fees were charged from swaps I did authorize were deducted from my account. \u00a0\n\n\\- Multiple duplicate deposits totaling $28k.\u00a0\n\nThis is all in the excel sheet attached to the previous email.\u00a0\n\n**-------------------------------------------------**\n\n**11/26- CB Response:**\n\n*Hello {redacted},*\n\n*Our decision remains final, and we're unable to make the requested changes to your Coinbase account.As a security measure, we can't elaborate on our internal decision process.*\n\n*Thank you for your understanding.*\n\n*Kind regards,Coinbase Support\ud83d\udcf7*\\*\\*\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------\n\n**My response only a FEW MINUTES AFTER their THIRD RESPONSE TO ME SINCE APRIL:**\n\nThank you for the response. This is absolutely disappointing and extremely poor customer service\u2014 especially after leaving customers waiting several months for a response.\n\nI will be having my attorneys contact you with a class action suit and will also be making a report to the BBB about this ordeal. Which address is preferable to send any/all legal documents?\u00a0\n\nPlease expect certified documents to be overnighted Tuesday or Wednesday as we have already prepared these in the event of non-cooperation.\u00a0\n\nI was hoping we could get this figured out without taking legal action, but I believe this will not be possible. Leaving customers without communication for 5 months on their investments will not hold up\u2014 only to liquidate and take their assets. Not only did I lose my money, I\u2019ve experience mental and life damages in terms of the theft\u2014 providing for my family, incurred debts, counseling, and such.\u00a0\n\nThanks\u00a0\n\n**-------------------------------------------------**\n\n**Completely Ignored, Ticket Closed, Opened Another Ticket on 12/08/2021:**\n\nNone of my questions were answered.\u00a0Please see below, as I am in need of the address to send legal documents asap:\u00a0\n\nIn regards to the original case: This is absolutely disappointing and extremely poor customer service\u2014 especially after leaving customers waiting SEVERAL months for a response.\n\nI will be having my attorneys contact you with a suit and will also be making a report to the BBB about this ordeal. Which address is preferable to send any/all legal documents? My case is identical to case number 3:21-cv-08689 which is currently filed against Coinbase.\u00a0\n\nPlease expect certified documents to be overnighted Tuesday or Wednesday as we have already prepared these in the event of non-cooperation.\u00a0I was hoping we could get this figured out without taking legal action, but I believe this will not be possible.\n\nLeaving customers without communication for months on their investments will not hold up\u2014 only to liquidate and take their assets. Not only did I lose my money, waste months of time I\u2019ll never get back, I\u2019ve also experience mental and life damages in terms of the theft and lack of cooperation on behalf of Coinbase\u2014 providing for my family, incurred debts, counseling, and such.\u00a0\n\nI apologize for the intensity of this message, but I was hoping Coinbase would have actual customer service. Unfortunately, Coinbase does not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Please see OWED BALANCES BELOW:**\n\n**Total owed on my account:**\n\n**- Balance that has vanished - $60,919**\n\n**- Duplicate deposits on my bank account that cleared but did not reflect on crypto balance- $28,469**\n\n**- \u201cFree\u201d conversions that incurred fees listed in transaction history**\n\n**- $11,918.69TOTAL: $101,306.69\u2013 which at current rates, would be near DOUBLE!**\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.

That was also attached and shown via my banking information history compared to the coinbase transaction history in the excel sheet. Exactly $28,469. Can this also be refunded?\u00a0\n3. Why did all my Bitcoin and crypto get liquidated when my account was compromised? I had $60,919 in crypto, I emailed, let y\u2019all know to look into it and lock my account in April, requested that it be converted to USD, and followed up several times asking about my balance\u2026 no response until November\u2014 that\u2019s several whole months. Can this be investigated and refunded?
