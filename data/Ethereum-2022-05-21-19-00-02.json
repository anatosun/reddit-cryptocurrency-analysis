Arable soil is a finite resource and we are losing large amounts of it year over year to poor farming practices that are the result of corporate farming and mono cropping. \n\nHe is / was a major proponent of \"decentralized farming\". Preserving the small farm with resilient local economies / communities, which are almost entirely eradicated. \n\nI understand how this quote could be cherry picked to get sympathy from the crypto crowd but it is important to understand the broader context of his work and how it is more similar than not to what Ethereum is trying to do with decentralized, resilient internet communities and peer to peer exchange of resources.",

You know the stuff that actually provides our nutrition.\n\nBig farming corporations are the result of short sighted efficiency. Sure, you can farm more acres with less people but the soil degradation is far worse, the product is worse and we still can't get it to everyone that needs it. So it may be efficient in one way but it is highly inefficient when considering the impact it has over time.\n\nHis point is that the small farm economies actually served the people in these regions. Now, there are food deserts everywhere and the vast majority of people are eating corn and soy products out of the gas station because they can't get to a grocery store.\n\nAlso we waste an absurd % of the food we grow anyway so, once again - efficiency, but in service to who? It isn't the people that need it.",

However, Wendell Berry in this essay made a special point of saying that he is avoiding computers specifically in order to avoid hypocrisy, but he hadn't genuinely done so, had he? So his explanation seems facetious and inadequate. I don't believe that it's the real reason for his resistance. Look, the guy was already over 50 years old by this point, set in his ways, and computers must have seemed to him like a young person's thing. It would have been easy for him to dismiss, given his views, but the motivation was likely not avoiding hypocrisy, as he claimed, but merely technophobia. Who wants to have to relearn the tools of their trade after the age of 50? It's a bit of a nightmare but time marches past all of us in the end.",

Drop a pile of handwritten notes on Wife and you get back a finished manuscript, edited while it was typed. What computer can do that? Wife meets all of Berry's uncompromising standards for techno- logical innovation: she's cheap, repairable near home, and good for the family structure. Best of all, Wife is politically correct because she breaks a writer's \"direct dependence on strip-mined coal.\"\nHistory teaches us that Wife can also be used to beat rugs and wash clothes by hand, thus eliminating the need for the vacuum cleaner and washing machine, two more nasty machines that threaten the act of writing.",

Most of them were right, but you don't remember because the products they criticized faded away into oblivion.\n\nI don't know if crypto will (or should) become as ubiquitous as computers, but it's way too early to run a victory lap. It's just a matter of if the general public is willing to deal with the downsides in favor of the upsides. Things like reality TV, social media, micro-transactions, and yes even computers have many societal downsides that people are not quiet about, but obviously the majority of people (or at least, enough to sustain it) are willing to overlook them in favor of the positives.\n\nI'm skeptical of crypto. Yes, I've invested, in case I'm wrong, but at this time I don't see the public at large finding much use for the technology. Maybe crypto will stick around for good, but I'm not sure it will see wide scale use like many of its loudest proponents are projecting.",

You are describing the 1970s, at the end of which the **personal** computer revolution began. By 1987, personal computers had been on the market for ten years. I had one for school. My father had a separate one for work. All his co-workers had computers at home for work as well. All my friends regardless of socioeconomic status used computers to print out their essays and school reports.\n\nThe ones who didn't have computers of their own would just go to the school's computer labs to type up their work and print it, labs which existed ever since the start of the personal computer revolution. I myself taught the basics of how to use personal computers to other students and even to some of the teachers, in these computer labs starting around 1979, and I kept doing it until the late '80s when it was no longer necessary because most people, students and teachers alike, understood the basics by then.\n\nPeople really have a wrong impression of what the computing scene was like in the '80s. It was taking the world *by storm*. I expect that's why Wendell Berry felt the need to write a contrarian essay about his refusal to jump on everybody's bandwagon.",
