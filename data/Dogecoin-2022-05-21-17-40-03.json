Everything you do can be traced both backwards and forwards. And despite the belief people have about anonymity, it\u2019s only pseudonymous. Once you expose a wallet as being yours, it is permanently identified as such.\n\nClients will happily mix coins from multiple wallets when they\u2019re choosing which UTXOs to spend. Likewise, when they send change to new wallets, that is also visible in the blockchain.\n\nThis cross linking vastly reduces privacy. Over time, all your coins can be identified unless you take steps to avoid that.\n\nPlus, try looking at a wallet and figure out what those coins you spent six years ago was for. It can be a hugely onerous task.\n\nSo, if you allocate a single wallet to each entity or purpose you interact with, you limit exposure to that one wallet. If you tip me now, you will see the transaction published by the tipbot. In there you will see my tipbot wallet. You will also see every tip I\u2019ve made, and also every withdrawal and deposit. But guess what? If you track those external transactions, you will find they all had a single counterparty. My text wallet allocated to sodogetip. I also have another such wallet allocated to the now defunct dogetipbot, but nothing to link the two together.\n\nAnd as for security, if a key is compromised, all the coins in that wallet are at risk. So let\u2019s say you carry coins around on a phone so you can spend them or show people how Doge works. If someone steals your phone, you\u2019ve lost your coins. But if you have a wallet specifically allocated for that purpose, then the rest of your coins are safe in their own, separate wallets. In my case, I have a wallet in Notes on my iPhone, and it has about ten bucks in it. If I lose it, big deal. And since I have a copy of the wallet in my masterfile, I stand an even chance of rescuing my coins before they can be stolen anyway.\n\nMake sense?",

However, the \"bank\" wallet must have more physical backups, in order to be able to reach it unexpectedly in many ways, dividing one's doge into many \"banking\" wallets I think becomes risky.",
