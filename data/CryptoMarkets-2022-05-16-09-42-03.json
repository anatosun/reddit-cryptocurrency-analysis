Did you think your mom was a buyer in a crashing market? Maybe it was the crypto market fairies buying an asset that was dropping faster then a $2 hooker of half price Tuesday..... \n\nLFG and tge backing assets (BTC) was BUYING to try and halt the price from crashing and stabilise UST and LUNA! \n\n$1 billion in BTC to try and halt $10 billion in sell orders.... And you honestly wonder where the BTC disappeared to? \n\nIt's in the wallets of anyone who got out of UST and LUNA! And tgeir UST and LUNA is now in LFG's wallets.... That's how trading works  a buyer is needed for every seller!\n\nEDIT: Not sure why this is getting downvoted.... Do people literally not understand HOW markets function?",

It wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when. The truly despicable part about the whole situation is all the large (crypto) institutional investors who invested in the private rounds. I don't believe for one second that these institutions didn't understand LUNA/UST for what it was and what would eventually happen. These institutions knew full well the inevitable outcome of LUNA/UST and they were entirely happy to invest early and prop this thing up to become what it did, they were just hoping their tokens would unlock so they could dump before the whole thing collapsed and death spiraled like it did.",

Who exactly do you think was willing to buy a coin in free fall? Would you expect you mom or dad to be on the buy side so that YOU had exit liquidity? What about your LUNA if you wanted to exit during the crash.... WHO TF IS ON THE BUY SIDE OF YOUR SELL ORDER.... \n\nDuring a crash, there is not enough people willing to buy a asset that is loosing value! That's why price keeps crashing as the sell orders search for enough buy order liquidity to fill all the sell orders. \n\nTo try and stop the crash and hopefully regain peg, the sell orders MUST be filled and price bid back up. That means that the BUY ORDER volume MUST exceed the SELL ORDER volume. That takes someone WILLING to buy LUNA and UST while it's in free fall..... That's where the backing comes in. It gets used to BUY UST and LUNA that everyone is dumping into the market (hence why the assets on the LFG books in the above tweet now show they hold a shitload of UST and LUNA and all the BTC is gone) \n\nThe BTC was used exactly how it was supposed to be used.... to try and back UST and LUNA!",
