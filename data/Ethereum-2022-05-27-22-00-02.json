            "selftext": "So I just downloaded Coinbase and Coinbase wallet. And transferred $5.49. To test it. But that isn\u2019t my question. So because of fees and gas and those types of things. I am bridgeing it to polygon (my ETH) but\u2026. For NFTs\u2026 can I still buy ETH NFTs with Polygon. Or do I need to transfer it to ETH??? Or should I just keep it ETH?\nIt may sound confusing but all I\u2019m wondering is: can polygon be used for Ethereum purchases, for example NFTs",
