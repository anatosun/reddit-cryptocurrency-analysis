Noticed there was a dip happening so I got all set up with kraken and have been waiting for an ideal point to buy. I\u2019m only gonna buy like 20-50 bucks worth to start off so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not going to matter too much\u2026 but I would like to buy in at the lowest point I can. \n\nWhat\u2019s the word with when to buy? Noticed it\u2019s hovering around 29-30k recently, should I wait for it to dip more or should I just pull the trigger around 29?\n\nThanks for any advice \u270c\ud83c\udffb",
