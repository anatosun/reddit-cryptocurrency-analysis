I said decide if the investment is worth it to average down a stock verses putting it in another investment. \n\nOk, I'll show you can example. I bought EFL at $1.26 8 months ago. Looking at the financials for the company I thought they had a ways to go but they have a good product. As such I did a smaller investment. Over the next two months I watched the stock fall to high 90's then bounce right back up to my break even point. Sometimes going just higher but not high enough to make selling worth it. I then started averaging down to 0.90. The price bounced up and I sold it at 1.09 and made a good profit on it. I sold it at that point because the financials weren't supporting the current price and I felt it would soon fall (which it did).\n\nHad I not started averaging down I would have lost money but because I averaged down I made profit. I'm NOT saying to average down on Doge and have never said or argued that. I'm saying don't say averaging down doesn't work because it can depending on the investment but you have to do your own DD to see if a stock or crypto is worth it. \n\nLike I said. Best of luck.....",

Specially when you decided to buy coins after they broken the ath.  I personally dont touch coins that broken its all time high untill months after. Like doge. I saw it go all the way up to .70. I started buying in intervals after it reach bellow .15 cents.  Still have money left to buy more dips",
