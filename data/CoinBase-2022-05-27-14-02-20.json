I got this reply from support and it seems like a brush off. \n\nThanks for contacting Coinbase Support about Coinbase Card. \n \nWe would like to apologize for the inconvenience caused here. We are more than happy to assist you.\n \nYou can earn rewards with Coinbase Card simply by using the card for purchases. Rewards change on a rotating basis, and for the most up-to-date rewards, sign in to your Coinbase account. \n \nRewards are disbursed once a transaction is complete. This happens within 1-5 days for most transactions, but can take longer depending on the merchant. \n \nIf a reward has not appeared in your Coinbase account within 5 business days of the transaction, let us know",
