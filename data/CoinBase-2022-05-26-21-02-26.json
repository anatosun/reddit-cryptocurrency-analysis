As an example, if I expect a response like the following:\n\n{ \"coin\": \"BTC\", \"balance\": 123 }\n\n...what I often get back looks like this:\n\n{ \"coin\": \"BTC\", \"balance\": 123 }{ \"coin\": \"BTC\", \"balance\": 123 }\n\nSo the JSON is there, but it's duplicated.\n\nAnyone else noticed this happening, or have any idea where to report it?\n\nThanks in advance.",
