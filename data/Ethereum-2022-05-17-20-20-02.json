                    "response": "The word \"server\" imo is not very useful in the blockchain context; it combines together a bundle of concepts that are best treated separately. Particularly, think of the following ways that a user could connect to the blockchain:\n\n1. Use a Binance account.\n2. Run a piece of code that asks the Infura API endpoint what the blockchain state is, trust the answer. However, keys are still kept locally; the code signs transactions locally and sends them to the Infura API endpoint to be re-broadcasted.\n3. Same as (2), but the code also runs a [light client](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/sync-protocol.md) to verify the signatures on the block headers and uses Merkle proofs to verify individual account and storage data.\n4. Same as (3), but the code talks to N different API endpoints run by N different companies, so only 1 of them need to be providing honest answers for the connection to be reliable.\n5. Same as (4), but instead of pre-specifying N API endpoints the code connects directly to a p2p network\n6. Same as (5), but the code also does data availability sampling and accepts fraud proofs, so it can detect and refuse to accept blocks that are invalid.\n7. Run a fully verifying node.\n8. Run a fully verifying node that also participates in mining/staking.\n\nCurrently, only (1), (2), (7) and (8) are feasible, and (7) and (8) are too expensive for most users. Indeed, the whole reason why blockchains are the future of decentralization and self-hosting is not is that running a server that stays online 24/7 is even harder than (8) [if your staking node is only online 95% of the time, you're fine; if your _website_ is only online 95% of the time, that presents a serious annoyance for your users!].\n\nMoxie's critiques in the second half of the post strike me as having a correct criticism of the _current state_ of the ecosystem (where (1), (2), (7) and (8) are the only things that we have working code for), but they are missing where the blockchain ecosystem is going. There's already teams [working](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/2786) on [implementing](https://github.com/uink45/Beacon-Chain-Light-Client-Prototype) (3), (4), (5), and active research on [making](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/2792/) (6) [happen](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_tree_eip). These efforts, contrary to Moxie's claim that there's little _cryptography_ involved in crypto (correct about much of what's happening today!), are heavily based on some of the most cutting-edge and advanced cryptography out there: [Verkle trees](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/06/18/verkle.html), [ZK-SNARKs of the EVM](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-zk-evm-specification/11549), [BLS signature aggregation](https://ethresear.ch/t/pragmatic-signature-aggregation-with-bls/2105) and so on. \n\nAs for my theory about \"why this hasn't happened yet\", I would say a lot of it comes down to limited technical resources and funding. It's easier to build things the lazy centralized way, and it takes serious effort to \"do it right\". The Ethereum ecosystem did not have that much resources up until ~4 years ago.  Of course, ~4 years ago, the ecosystem did start to have a lot of resources, but new projects are slow to ramp up, and the centralized workarounds have had years of head start. One thing that makes the ramp up even slower is the chain of dependencies: in order to have light clients, we need to have a light client friendly chain, which is a deep change to the protocol, and so the only realistic opportunity to implement it is the switch to PoS, and we're only now at the point where we have the PoS, and full integration with the merge is coming soon. Fortunately, the dependencies are being attacked and resolved one-by-one, and there has already been a lot of progress! Once the general-purpose hard legwork is done by a few dedicated teams, building trustless applications will become much more feasible for all dev teams, that would just need to plug in the libraries.\n\nSo I think the properly authenticated decentralized blockchain world is coming, and is much closer to being here than many people think. Of course, it's always possible that all this tech will get built and many people will not care. But I'm more optimistic. Users generally accept defaults given by developers, and many developers really do genuinely care about decentralization and trustlessness (and growing legal issues with running centralized points of trust will push them to care more). Decentralized options that users reject today (eg. running a full node) really are quite difficult today, so it's understandable that users are sticking to the more centralized options that at least they can easily use. None of the proposals outlined here are anywhere remotely as difficult, and even running a full node itself will get easier and cheaper over time as ideas like statelessness and history expiry come into play. So I see no technical reason why the future needs to look like the status quo today.",

IMO I don't think fibre to the home is going anywhere for the next 20+ years. It will always provide the lowest latency, highest throughput to the home. 10Gbe in enterprises are a thing now, and they will be coming to homes in the next 5-10 years. \n\nImagine Ethereum's block chain size 3 times larger than it is now, over 10Gb. It would sync the chain in [~40 minutes](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3TB+over+10+gigabit+per+second) using low cost commodity hardware - compute and storage prices will continue to drop like they're now.  I digress from the point however that \"running your own server\" won't be the focal point, the technical hurdles we're jumping through now are not intended to be the expectation for the average end user in \"web3\".",

The trend among Core maxi's is to push people to custodial wallets like wallet of Satoshi or strike. \\\n\nAnd now with support for smartBCH the Bitcoin.com wallet is going to allow users to seamlessly and decentralised swap between stablecoins and BCH, instantly under 1 BCH for about 5 cents per swap. Or even enter in to hedge position using https://anyhedge.com/\n\nThe user experience with Bitcoin Cash is the best it's ever been, but still much room for improvement.\n\nTry it out for yourself.

The promise of bitcoin was that it operates without having to trust a central party\n\nThe Bitcoin.com wallet is an Simple Payment Verification wallet. [An essential part of Satoshi his plans to scale Bitcoin to the masses.](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/2/)\n\n>It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep\na copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying\nnetwork nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch\nlinking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for\nhimself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it,\nand blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.\nAs such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more\nvulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify\ntransactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated\ntransactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to\nprotect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid\nblock, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to\nconfirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to\nrun their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.\n\n\n >That in itself may not be entirely avoidable, but in the absence of a viable way to avoid putting some initial trust in an unknown party, I do tend to avoid recommending parties that I feel an active reason to distrust.\n\nYou don't need to trust any party when using the Bitcoin.com wallet. You should read up on how SPV works. You can verify your own transactions so nobody can bamzooble you.  When I use the Bitcoin.com wallet I don't have to trust anything or anybody. \n\nBitcoin Core also has SPV wallet like Elektrum. They work exactly the same except for instant payment which have been removed by Replace By Fee which Bitcoin Cash never adopted in to it's code. \n\n\nAnd of course on Bitcoin Core there is no guarantee your tx gets in to the next block because lots of times the mempool is full and you need to win a fee auction. \n\n\n>You can call it 'bamboozled', but you're likely not going to be able to convince me that in the early stages of the BCH fork that the people running bitcoin.com weren't actively using the misdirection and confusion to trick people into supporting their coin at the expense of what they were actually trying to do.

For that reason I don't consider them significantly different from the BTC team, and they have to be treated as untrustworthly sources just like any other.\n\nThe Bitcoin Core team [actively DDOSSED](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4835fp/blockstreamgmaxwell_will_have_you_believe_there/) any competing nodes of the network. In some cases their  DDOS nuked entire rural providers. \n\nThey also banned any discussion about it from bitcointalk.org and /r/bitcoin and any IRC servers, and the Bitcoin dev mailing lists.\n\nAll that Roger Ver did was call BTC Bitcoin Core and BCH Bitcoin Cash when selling both coins on Bitcoin.com \n\n \n\n>To be fair, all of crypto has that same issue, even if it hasn't been shown in the same way in all other coins.

The simple fact that external platforms like .com or twitter or /reddit has so much influence shows the crypto is in a very unstable state just yet...and once a wallet or two start becoming super dominant, we'll have ownership of that domain/souce to be concerned about too.\n\nActually Bitcoin Cash has 6 full nodes team that work independently from each other and are independently funded.  \n\n\nhttps://bitcoincashnode.org/en/\n\nhttps://bchd.cash/\n\nhttps://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/\n\nhttps://bitcoinverde.org/\n\nhttps://kth.cash/\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/FloweeTheHub/thehub\n\n\n>and once a wallet or two start becoming super dominant\n\nSo these 6 independ full node teames, well all these nodes also work as wallet. \n\nNext to that there are more then 70 different wallet for Bitcoin Cash, from client side java wallets to SPV wallets for android and IOS, etc etc etc etc. \n\n\nMost of these wallets are compatible with each other which means you can export your seed from one wallet and import in to the other and then have access to your funds.\n\nThis is very decentralised. The majority of these wallets are open source so you can look a the code or make changes to it and then compile your own wallet.",

If they had added qualifiers to both, even the fact that they listed BCH first and more obviously could have been overlooked or justified, but calling it Bitcoin and in a less prominent button also offering something called Bitcoin Core cannot.  True, they did eventually change to promote qualifiers to both, but not after already showing themselves to be willing to stoop before correcting course.\n\nThird, 6 teams now doesn\u2019t mean 6 or 10 or 2 teams in the future.  Just because it happens to be okay now doesn\u2019t mean there are any safeguards in the future\u2026just look at how close ABC came to knocking the feet out from under us, or SV with its fork.  BCH is every bit as *susceptible* to centralization, just like BTC looked good and decentralized in the early days.\n\nLastly, trust in a wallet is different than trust in open source\u2026being on a platform it seems almost trivial to throw in a proprietary \u2018tweak\u2019 or two in the final product even if you\u2019re source code is open, there\u2019s always something you can\u2019t include in the platform hash, even if it\u2019s only credential related or whatever\u2026being the creator of a mobile wallet will always give you an avenue to take advantage of some people, even if it\u2019s just the lazy ones, even if it risks trashing your reputation, we\u2019re still stuck trusting those safeguards, instead of just the underlying tech.",

In fact, credit doesn\u2019t matter at all. This will allow people who don\u2019t have a credit history or poor credit to borrow if they need it. \n\n2) there is no centralized service providing the loan, or managing it. It\u2019s all done through pools of liquidity and run by computer code. It\u2019s trustless. \n\n3) I can\u2019t speak about P2P rates but often the rates to borrow money in DeFi are very good. In fact, some are so good that with incentives, you *get paid* to borrow money. I haven\u2019t seen that before DeFi. \n\n4) it allows people to earn interest passively by lending it out to the pool. Again, often the rates for lending are quite good, but sometimes not as high as something like staking or liquidity providing. \n\n5) it\u2019s possible to do things like take out a loan that is automatically paid back over time. Protocols like alchemix do this. I have used it and it works.",

The difference between home hosted BTC/Ethereum nodes is so marginal it's not even worth talking about.\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/FEQ8qKEVEAUNlYh?format=jpg&name=900x900",

I'm either in some confirmation bias/Kool-Aid loop or my perception of time and expectations are different than others. \n\n>A protocol moves much more slowly than a platform. After 30+ years, email is still unencrypted; meanwhile WhatsApp went from unencrypted to full e2ee in a year. \n\nTCP/IP wasn't the best protocol, but it had the magical \"It works\" + adoption. When it wasn't good enough, it simply changed. Sure, there was debate's and concerns, but what average person remembers that? Now we have enough addresses to accommodate growth with IPv6. These **protocols move slow because they work**, and people are busy doing things on top of it. **Demand for change, creates change**\n\nMost email _communication_ is encrypted. The demand (or value) for encrypted email messages are not high enough for it to be adopted. There's better systems to accomplish the goal (e.g. \"Why are you putting _that_ in email?\"). Email is still needed - just for different use cases than it was 30+ years ago. For organizations or individuals that need to encrypt email - they simply encrypt them using easy to use features that are already built. \n\nThe examples of centralized API's, OpenSea, MetaMask are all valid points, I personally just view these as transitional phases, or onboardings. You can be critical of how they're transitioning, but that's what it is - a transition. Ethereum impresses me because it continues to evolve while not only maintaining the network effect but growing it's adoption. The more adoption, the less agile you become. But change is still obviously happening. \n\nIf there is a demand for a decentralized web3, it will happen so long as the demand persists. Ask an average person how they feel about these private social media companies, and the power they wield. I think the answer now would be different than only 5-6 years ago. The real question in my opinion: is Web2 good enough? Or, Is there a demand for Web3? \n\nPersonally, I think so.",

It used to be the case (in the US at least, say like 1980's or earlier) that the day someone turned 16, there was an urgency to take the driving test so they could start driving. Today, that doesn't matter nearly as much. Plenty of people are late teen years or even into their 20's and don't need a car. Why bother? They can do most, maybe all, of those things without a car - social, freedom, employment, identity.\n\nSo, I agree with NFT value for some aspects of digital/online property ownership, like an online community where I can buy something and display it to everyone else.",

Which sounds\u2026 familiar. At this point, there are basically two companies. Almost all dApps use either [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) in order to interact with the blockchain. In fact, even when you connect a wallet like MetaMask to a dApp, and the dApp interacts with the blockchain via your wallet, MetaMask is just making calls to Infura!\n>\n>These client APIs are not using anything to verify blockchain state or the authenticity of responses. The results aren\u2019t even signed. An app like Autonomous Art says \u201chey what\u2019s the output of this view function on this smart contract,\u201d Alchemy or Infura responds with a JSON blob that says \u201cthis is the output,\u201d and the app renders it.\n>\n>This was surprising to me. So much work, energy, and time has gone into creating a trustless distributed consensus mechanism, but virtually all clients that wish to access it do so by simply trusting the outputs from these two companies without any further verification. It also doesn\u2019t seem like the best privacy situation. Imagine if every time you interacted with a website in Chrome, your request first went to Google before being routed to the destination and back. That\u2019s the situation with ethereum today. All write traffic is obviously already public on the blockchain, but these companies also have visibility into almost all read requests from almost all users in almost all dApps.\n\nOof, the state of Ethereum is even worse than I thought.\n\n>What I found most interesting, though, is that after OpenSea removed my NFT, it also no longer appeared in any crypto wallet on my device. This is web3, though, how is that possible?\n>\n>[...]\n>\n>Again, like with my dApp, these responses are not authenticated in some way. They\u2019re not even signed so that you could later prove they were lying. It reuses the same connections, TLS session tickets, etc for all the accounts in your wallet, so if you\u2019re managing multiple accounts in your wallet to maintain some identity separation, these companies know they\u2019re linked.\n\nWhat a shit show.",

Solving contradiction is how people grow up. \n\nBesides, they're particularly on point. \n\nI understand there are a few ideals, in there, that are conflicting with the reality that some forms of governance aren't actually as ideal in practice as they're supposed to be in theory. To me, for instance, most forms of collectivism should be avoided any time it's possible, so that helping each others becomes an actual virtue being cultivated rather than forced action being avoided. \n\nI think some of these contradictions can't be solved in themselves in a trustless ecosystem, as it's expected to see cheapest forms of any service to become predominant noise in a trustless ecosystem (it's cheap to create speculative assets, as much as creating misinformation) and that only shows a need for tools to filter out the noise from the signal, up to the point where noise learns how to cheaply become signal. \n\nBut other contradictions could be solved by having several competing decentralized chains, notably a few different versions of Ethereum.",

I\u2019ve always felt the best leaders think in time ranges of many many years and sometimes beyond their own lives.

He laps me twice over in intelligence, but I feel like I could sit down with him and have a meaningful dialogue or just goof around. \n\nSomething that I felt after reading that though, is that I get the sense that vitalik\u2019s very much focused on leaving Ethereum. I don\u2019t think any of us would be surprised that one day he will, but this thread struck me like he was saying without saying that ethereum is me and I am ethereum and it needs to not be that way. I\u2019m doubtful it happens anytime soon, but in the medium term I\u2019m suspect he will step away from ETH and let it grow without him. \n\nI think we can all agree having a project with a face attached to it is a risk. It\u2019s great that ethereums is vitalik\u2019s, but a risk nonetheless and a truly decentralized product is faceless. Anyone else get that sense?",

I cant even how someone could imagine you couldn't. The reason it is obvious that V has a bigger ego is that when given the choice one person chose to be indifiable and have his name plastered all over his work and the other chose not to. That is how we can decide who has a bigger ego. \u0130 mean, i get it, Vitalik(like almost everyone) wanted attention and praise for his hard work. That's fine, but let's not pretend like it is something other than it is just because the guy came up with some good ideas, jeesh.",

In theory Ethereum has sort-of got there, at least once we have data sharding, so Ethereum should be able to do Bitcoin-style ossification fairly soon without the downside being as serious as it is for bitcoin - if that's what people choose.",
