Gave us 30hrs notice that it was listing on coinbase PRO and then released it on normal coinbase 2 hours later when they usually wait a few weeks between. \n\nLiterally zero advertising it was gonna be on coinbase but that single blog post saying it was going on pro. I'm getting ads for webull and toro for dogecoin, I haven't seen a single one for coinbase. \n\nThey did doge dirty lol. I feel like they only listed it because they had too not that they wanted to. \n\nA coinbase listing was supposed to rocket us, it gave us like 5-8\u00a2 increase lol considering Bitcoin was almost at 40k. Things aren't looking that good for the ol doge and I hold quite a fair few coins.",
