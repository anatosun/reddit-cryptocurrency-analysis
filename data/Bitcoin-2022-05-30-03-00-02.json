The guy gave a stranger some BTC and the stranger ordered and delivered pizza using fiat.   \n  \nShut up about this pizza. If you want to praise someone, praise the guy who accepted the BTC and used his fiat to pay for a pizza. He's the only person in this situation who risked anything and he's the only one who gets no acknowledgement.",
