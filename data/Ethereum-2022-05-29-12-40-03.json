E.g. here's one example where I describe why NFTs aren't necessarily authentic: https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/\nAnother one is that e.g. while beeple.eth may be a well-known name within the space, e.g. beeple could just publish a stolen Banksy piece as an NFT and there'd be nothing stopping him from doing so. There's no magic that authenticates who publishes what is intrinsic to NFTs. But it's true that I don't explain that in the article...",

I guess it was a way to keep the most of the original artist's message, but it feels odd to read. I'd rather write \"un NFT\". \n\nPretty good article overall. There's just one part I'd see as not really on point, but it's only marginal: the point regarding likes and messages sent from computer to computer. Communication is a tool of social standards. Whatever we use, even our voices and sounds and languages, are symbols articulated to convey meanings. It can't be anything but symbols ans these complex symbols themselves are exactly what we're trying to convey, because it entirely carries the meaning we can share with others (even though the meaning we think about is generally even more complex, our tools can only convey so much complexity). As such, to me, communication wasn't a good example, because it's one where the symbol is the object. This is very different from NFTs, where the symbol isn't what's represented by it.",
