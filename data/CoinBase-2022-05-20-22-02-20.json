They won\u2019t close the fraudulently opened account and provided quite possibly the worst customer experience I have ever experienced. No phone support and mostly automated email replies. My advice would be to NEVER open an account with Coinbase. It\u2019s seems to be a haven for fraud. \nEdit - not sure why I\u2019m getting called for B.S. nor the downvotes. A Coinbase account was setup in my name (not by me) and Coinbase won\u2019t close it at my request. Their customer service response was non-existent and after some research I have found quite a bit of fraud documented with this site and service. I have no motivation to make this up besides my name and address (and whatever other personal info) being used to setup an account that isn\u2019t mine.  I would just like the account closed and know what other personal info was used to set up this account.",
