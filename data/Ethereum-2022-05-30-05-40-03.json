Gas prices are determined by the total amount of gas available in each block (block space), and the speed at which the network is producing new blocks (block time). Both of these things aren't changing with PoS (not in any meaningful way, PoS *is* reducing block time by around 10%-ish, but that'll be instantly cancelled out by an equivalent increase in network usage), so PoS cannot and will not affect gas prices.\n\nSharding also won't affect L1 gas prices, as its been repurposed to instead offer a scalable *data storage* layer for the network, when the bottleneck right now is *computation.* L2 gas prices *will* be affected by sharding, though, as L2s can make use of the extra data storage that shards provide to pack more transactions within each batch, driving the individual user's cost of settlement down, which is one of the main things that users pay for within L2s.",

Ethereum is keeping them intentionally small for this reason, to allow a *wide* range of devices to participate in the network.\n\nI believe the intended minimum requirements post-merge are hovering around a Raspberry Pi equipped with a 1-2TB SSD and a 10/10 Mbps internet connection (10Mbps both for upload and download), or somewhere around there.",

Presumably if a node becomes trivial to spin up for compute costs we would see many more on the network.\n\nEdit: I can\u2019t find anything that would suggest it does, and thinking about it I can\u2019t think of how it would without execution sharding.
