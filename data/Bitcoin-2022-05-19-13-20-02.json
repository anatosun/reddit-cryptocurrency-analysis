Good luck organizing every person who owns bitcoin to do the same thing you want them to do rather than what they want to do. Someone can decide that $75k is enough for them, and they'd sell before the buyers get to $100k. Maybe someone else sees that and decides that's fine for them too, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In other words, how was the current price of any coin determined? Why it changes automagically? There must be some algorithm that determines those things.\n\nSupply and demand. The summed up feelings of the market change constantly, so the price does also. There is no algorithm that determines those things, unless you consider the voluntary actions of buyers and sellers as an algorithm running on a distributed analog computer.",
