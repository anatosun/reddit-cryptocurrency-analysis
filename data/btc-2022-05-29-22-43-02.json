With an API wallet, you're trusting the service to do that.\n\nIf a malicious ElectrumX or Fulcrum server provided you with a transaction that wasn't in a block, the wallet should show that it's bogus automatically.  \n\nIf there was a problem with bitcoin.com's API, you'd know when you went to spend coins that weren't actually there.\n\nIf there was ever an issue, in this case, you could simply import your keys into an SPV wallet to get that security.  I think bitcoin.com uses the m/44'/0'/0' BIP44 derivation path, for historical reasons, which you may need to import into an SPV wallet.",

An SPV wallet like electroncash will switch between servers automatically if one goes off line.\n\nSPV wallets, e.g. electroncash, also support hardware wallets, which are important security tools if you have large amounts of cryptocurrency to keep safe.\n\nI use electron cash with a hardware wallet to hold most of my funds.  I use the bitcoin.com wallet for pocket change, and use this from my phone because it is much safer than carrying my hardware wallet around. It is easy, fast and cheap to move money between these two  wallets.\n\nIt is also possible to recover funds put in one of these wallets using completely different wallet software, e.g. bitcoin.com vs. electroncash or other wallets, as all the ones you should use will accept the same seed words.   (As others have pointed out there may be various magic incantations, a.k.a. derivation strings, required to effect this.)\n\nIt\u2019s fine to play around with various wallets and use them for toy amounts of transactions, but it is a good idea to test recovery funds across multiple wallets from seed words before playing with significant amount of funds.  For life changing amounts of funds you definitely need to use a hardware wallet.  Since you don\u2019t want to be subject to a [\u201cfive dollar wrench\u201d](https://xkcd.com/538/) attack you should keep the bulk of your funds physically in a safe place and use a separate wallet for daily spending.",

For example, your phone keeps all the details of past transactions locally.  You can compose new transactions locally, scan QR codes, etc.  You can see the difference while your internet service is disconnected. In addition, the electron cash wallet comes configured with a list of servers run by separate organizations or people. If one of these goes down your app will automatically switch to another server on the list.  If all the servers on the list go down you can add new servers to the list manually.  You can even select a private server you run yourself on your own property, which is what I have done, running a BCHN node behind a Fulcrum SPV server on a Raspberry Pi.\n\nI have never seen my bitcoin.com wallet down except when my personal internet service was out for some reason.
