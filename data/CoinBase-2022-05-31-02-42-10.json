In light of recent volatility involving Terra ecosystem assets UST and LUNA, Coinbase suspended trading in UST and WLUNA on May 27, 2022 around 12pm ET on Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, and Coinbase Exchange. You can still use these products to store, send, and receive UST and WLUNA. There is no impact to Coinbase Wallet.\nPlease note, we only support storing, sending or receiving UST & WLUNA on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nCoinbase will not initially be supporting the LUNA airdrop. If we do support it in the future then we\u2019ll announce the details via our help center page & our official social media handles.",
