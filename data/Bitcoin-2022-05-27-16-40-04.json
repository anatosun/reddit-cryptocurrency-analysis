                    "response": "Well it's complicated\n\nIt doesn't help against a 51% attack because that is about hash power. Your node isn't mining, so you don't add any hash power.\n\nIf you just run the node it will not do much, except you have a copy of the blockchain on your computer. However, it gives you first class access to the Bitcoin network. You are essentially part of the network, and if you use your node to send transactions instead of ledger's node then you add to decentralization.\n\nApart from that it adds more privacy to your transactions, because you don't need to give your xpub to ledger. The node will also ensure that it enforces the rules for you. If there ever should be another situation where someone wants to force a hard fork you don't have to worry on what side the wallet provider whose node you used is on, because you have your own node.\n\nSo if you use your node you add in two important ways to decentralization. You use Bitcoin in the decentralized fashion it was intended to be used, and you help make sure the rules can't be changed by making you independent from people who could decide such things for you.\n\nhttps://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop is a nice frontend for bitcoin core if you want to use your ledger directly with your node.",

The node network follows the longest chain, whether the tied mining race was genuine or forced  \n\n\"Attack\" is a matter of human opinion. A node doesn't have an opinion. It follows the same rules for every block  \n\nWhy run a node? If you run your own node, you can trust your node's copy of the blockchain. Otherwise, you have to trust some stranger's node",

This is when the attacks are on the bitcoin protocol, the fundamental characteristics of bitcoin: the 21m cap, the block size, etc\u2026 in other words at the constitutional level. Like in 2017 during the b-cash hard fork, and btc node owners, by sticking to existing software (and refuse to \u201cupgrade\u201d to the newer version or acknowledge the bigger blocks) helped maintained the bitcoin protocol and fended off an almost fatal attack. This is arguably the most important form of protection and our nodes are helping here (just make sure we don\u2019t blindly update our software without first knowing what\u2019s the \u201cupgrade\u201d\u2026 it\u2019s ok to stick to the old version if unsure)\n\nThe lower level would be on the individual transaction/ block level. This is less about the fundamental characteristics of bitcoin and more on double spending a specific transaction, or DDoS attack by mining empty block, etc, this is where the 51% attack comes in. If someone somehow spends billions of dollars quietly accumulate hashing rigs and perform 51% attack on the network, from the non-mining nodes it seems there isn\u2019t a whole lot we could do directly. The defence needs to come from the hash arms race. If that happens we can expect all the honest mining rigs would spin up to top speeds and new ASICS will be urgently deployed in the hope of beating the attacker.\n\nI guess if the 51% attacking miners are known, the non mining nodes could be configured (just my guess) to reject any transaction coming from the hostile miners\u2026 rendering their hash rates useless\u2026 would be interesting to find out how feasible that is\u2026 but somehow we need to be able to identify the hostile miners which is probably not easy. The transactions from the 51% attacks are still valid bitcoin txs because they DO follow the bitcoin protocol. The most direct way to prevent 51% attack is to beef up the honest hash rate (which is what bitcoin excels at, nothing comes remotely close to btc hash rates and we call bitcoin the worlds biggest computer network for a good reason)\n\nJust my 2 sats.",

Miners will always have the choice of which transactions to include or not to include in their blocks, that's inherent in how bitcoin works and your node won't help you with censorship attacks.",
