Would appreciate if someone could point me in the right direction! Looking to answer questions like: What and when was the first oracle created? What protocols were around before chainlink came into play? How are newer protocols, like Chainlink, better / more efficient than earlier iterations?\n\nThanks in advance for any help!",
