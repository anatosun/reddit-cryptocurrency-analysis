Keep in mind that L2s do pay Ethereum fees, but they are far lower on a per user basis.\n\nAnother way to think about this is Apple cannibalizing their iPod business in favor of the iPhone. Sure, they lost money when the iPod went away but the iPhone brought in so much new revenue and ecosystem growth. That\u2019s how I think about L2s.",

Later, we'll more than make it up on volume.\n\nAfter sharding, zkrollups will be able to handle around 100,000 tx/sec. If we're only doing a small fraction of that and not much on L1, there will be lots of unused block space and gas prices will plummet. On the other hand, if gas prices do plummet then more people will use L1, so this is sort of a self-limiting problem. Also, if usage is growing fast then we'll have lots of new people buying ETH even if they aren't spending it for gas immediately.\n\nLong-term, I don't think there's a world where we're doing anywhere near 100,000 tx/sec on Ethereum where the ETH price isn't sky-high.",

Would appreciate if someone could point me in the right direction! Looking to answer questions like: What and when was the first oracle created? What protocols were around before chainlink came into play? How are newer protocols, like Chainlink, better / more efficient than earlier iterations?\n\nThanks in advance for any help!",

This was a system designed to work around Bitcoin limitations, where we'd produce pairs of public keys representing yes and no answers to a binary question and only reveal the private key for one of them. This was based on ideas by Mike Hearn and Peter Todd on a Bitcoin Talk thread that I can no longer find. It was hard to use because making smart contracts on Bitcoin is hell. We eventually reoriented the project to handle general human language questions answered on-chain instead of data APIs and dropped Bitcoin support, and the current incarnation is called [reality.eth](https://reality.eth.limo). \n\nLater in 2014 Thomas Kolinko and others built [Orisi](https://orisi.org/about) (not sure of the release date) which was an attempt to make an oracle with a more decentralized design.\n\nAlso in 2014 Paul Sztorc released the [Truthcoin](https://www.truthcoin.info/papers/truthcoin-whitepaper.pdf) whitepaper, which was a design for a game-theoretically robust trustless oracle. The core concepts in this were subsequently implemented by the [Augur](https://augur.net/) team for the oracle built into their prediction market system.\n\nEthereum went live in July, 2015. We had Devcon 1 that year and Thomas Bertani announced Oraclize, which was an Ethereum-native system where you could send a contract a request for some data and it would call it back with the result from some URL. (I'm not sure when he built it but it was live by Devcon 1.) They subsequently rebranded to [Provable](https://provable.xyz/).\n\nOnce Ethereum started to get traction everything went bananas and there were loads of new projects, notably [ChainLink](https://chain.link/).",
