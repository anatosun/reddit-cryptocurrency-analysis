Even though bitcoin is scarce and secure, some new hot thing in the future could just come and replace bitcoin. I don't want to say altcoins, cuz I'm not a big fan of altcoins, but you get the point. If it can happen to gold it can happen to bitcoin, there is no true scarcity of deflationary assets, and thats not a good feeling to give.
