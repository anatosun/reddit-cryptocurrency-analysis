With people holding less than 32Eth clearly wanting a piece of the staking pie, they're all going to flock to staking pools.  And they're all going to flock to big names and pools with a reputation, usually stemming from other stakers who will \"vouch\" for one.  Because let's face it, we're all lazy and it's more reassuring to stake in a pool that doesn't have just 3 other people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nButerin has talked about staking pools \"self throttling\".  Is that really the solution going forward?  Everyone self imposing restrictions through altruism for the system's integrity.  I just can't see that being viable.",

The network should be flexible enough to apply incentives or penalties to make sure it can continue growing safely. Simply trusting in the good faith of Lido or any other third parties is not a good policy, you need to clearly show the path to follow to all stakers.",
