With people holding less than 32Eth clearly wanting a piece of the staking pie, they're all going to flock to staking pools.  And they're all going to flock to big names and pools with a reputation, usually stemming from other stakers who will \"vouch\" for one.  Because let's face it, we're all lazy and it's more reassuring to stake in a pool that doesn't have just 3 other people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nButerin has talked about staking pools \"self throttling\".  Is that really the solution going forward?  Everyone self imposing restrictions through altruism for the system's integrity.  I just can't see that being viable.",

The network should be flexible enough to apply incentives or penalties to make sure it can continue growing safely. Simply trusting in the good faith of Lido or any other third parties is not a good policy, you need to clearly show the path to follow to all stakers.",

If their staking model turns out to be a potential risk to the whole network because it promotes centralization, then someone is actually doing something wrong, even though it's unintentional and they always meant to do good. A 51% attack would be much worse than applying penalties to avoid dangerous centralization; it could actually be the end of Ethereum itself.\n\nOf course it would be much better if this could be solved by incentivizing decentralized staking away from Lido or cloud services. Maybe we should think more about this. \n\nPoS needs to be decentralized, not a monopoly of the devs, Lido or anyone else. It's a matter of setting up clear principles and rules and make every party stick to them.",

                    "response": "Yes, that\u2019s a quite risk. PoS in Ethereum needs a greater than 66% vote of the validators to finalise a block. Finalise in this context means that this block and all the blocks before will be forever part of the blockchain and there can\u2019t be a reorganisation of blocks to undo them. That\u2019s a change in regards to PoW and one of the big advantages that PoS has over PoW. So Lido could block that if they wanted to. There is no financial gain for them, as the protocol would slowly take away their stake funds, but it would create problems for people who wait until a transaction is finalised.",
