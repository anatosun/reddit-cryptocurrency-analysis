                    "response": "First you need to understand what this security budget refers to. In no normal blockchain (bitcoin and ethereum included) can you break the rules. i.e. no number of miners or stakers can make an update that takes your money without your signature. **What miners and stakers can do is play with the timing of events, and in an attacks, do it retrospectively (re-org).** In PoW chains, a 51% attack pays for itself, and the attacker gets the block reward, fees and the gains from the re-org. So the main hurdle is the huge up-front capital (and in the case of bitcoin, of machines that can do little else). In PoS, after finality (normally <15 minutes), any re-org will cause slashing of at least 1/3 of stakers, so 4M ETH will be burned. So to make a relatively short re-org, one would need to burn >$8B, which is significantly more than the economic gains that one can have. A few minor points - you can see a re-org coming, as the number of stakers signing will go down from 99.9% to \\~66%. Setting up such an attack will take not only money, but time, at which the preparations may be very visible (need to buy/deposit for a 2/3 majority), so if you plan an attack today, and haven't deposited ETH yet, you need 24M ETH (double the current stake), plus 2x whatever ETH flow in until you attack, plus the time to deposit all of this (at \\~1300 validators = \\~41,000ETH per day ATM). Attacking bitcoin without a factory for ASIC is similarly very hard.",

This means competing against a successful 51% attack isn't sustainable and that you can't get rid of such attack through a fork. In such circumstances, a PoW-based network is lost to centralized censorship. \n\nAnd that's what China could have done last year. When they forbid mining activities, they had more than 50% of the mining power on their soil. Within months, they reduced it to nearly 0%. Instead of shutting it all down, they could very well have seized all the equipment and mined themselves, essentially succeeding at a 51% attack. They didn't seize the opportunity, which is very fortunate, but it's an opportunity that could easily happen again. \n\nWithin a PoS-based chain, you can always count on Layer 0 to fork away the attacker, destroying ~100% of their staked funds in the process.",

Many countries have shown they're willing to spend much for such power. Profitability is more than just a question of money. \n\n>About China, banning is one thing, collecting all machines is another.\n\nIf you ban the equipment itself from leaving the country and criminalize anyone who doesn't deliver it to the government, you have all the time you want to seize it. Even more so if you incentivize voluntary gifting to the state through money and social points. Different degrees of such measures have already been successfully used in the past regarding gold, in several countries that are believed to be way less oppressive than China.",
