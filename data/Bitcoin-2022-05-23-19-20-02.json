So my question is two-fold:\n\n1. Would you recommend I just move all my BTC purchasing power to Cash App for later transfer to a cold wallet?\n\n2. Which wallet do you recommend Ledger or Trezor?\n\nThanks in advance!",

ATMs are expensive, but perform a very useful service, so pay the fees (do math, before and after) and support the economy that supports the unbanked. Use the local currency of choice to hire professionals to help move larger quantities (get banked), and if using an exchange, use personal banking with your FIAT to KYC into the exchange before you start loading the account with your BTC. Use fiat to test all the inputs and outputs before you even acknowledge owning that much to any institution.",
