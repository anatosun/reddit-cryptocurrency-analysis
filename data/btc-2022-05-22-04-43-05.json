Don't forget you can withdraw for free from FTX, but Binance withdrawal fee of **$6** is only like 0.1% anyway. FTX BTC withdrawals are free for any amount, but under $300 only once/day.\n\nI mostly trade tether, though, and use BCH as a **S**tore-**O**f-**V**alue. It turns out tokens are more useful for trade, but maybe not for payments (in the long run). I actually just bought some BCH over at LocalCryptos a couple days ago (the bank transfer was actually done quicker than the BCH confirmation, since we used 0-conf). You can try out tether trading at WebMoney & Binance P2P.",
