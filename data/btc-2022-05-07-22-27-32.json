It has not economically thrived as well as BCH has either. It is hanging out in the top 100 cryptos and doing some interesting things like rebranding, moving the decimal and adding Avalanche-style pre and post consensus code on top of proof of work. \n\nThey are rebuilding their lost (from losing the BCH-fork battle)  infrastructure and mostly ignoring the social media circus and it's need for constant hand-holding. They appear to be quietly working to fulfill the dream of Bitcoin while arguably violating some of the unwritten assumptions Bitcoin purists hold dear. Most controversial in this sub-forum is probably the part where they take 8% of the miner's rewards from the miners to fund development and marketing.\n\nThe Avalanche work appears to be going slowly but steadily. It should provide resistance to hash-war attacks (arguably sacrilege) and make transactions over 99% reliable within seconds (a possible game-changer). \n\nLike BCH, eCash (XEC) can't scale for massive worldwide adoption yet. That said, they both already scale much better than BTC (\"Bitcoin\") and I think they are the only projects still working to develop the code that allows them to scale up enough so that they could fulfill the dream of Bitcoin. If either develops that ability, they could go viral (adoption) and change the world. All the other \"bells and whistles\" the projects are working on would make it easier to make that viral adoption begin and go smoothly (in theory), but that underlying scaling code is what is needed to make the Bitcoin-dream of magic internet money for the people of the world possible.\n\nSo, did eCash (or BCH) succeed? Not yet. IMO they have so much potential if they figure out how to scale up to full-world size... And, no. Just making the blocks bigger is not the solution. If they could scale, could their wallets and apps handle the massive viral adoption? I'm not sure, but, that would be a great problem to need to work on while the value of the coin goes well past the moon.",

A new major feature was added, [LNS Name](https://app.bch.domains/) support.  You can now send money to LNS names (e.g. `calin.bch`) which end up resolving to BCH addresses.  See `Tools` -> `Lookup LNS Names`. Additionally, a minor UI quirk was addressed: seeing temporary negative balances in the history tab due to CTOR transaction ordering has been worked around by sorting the history with receives coming before sends for each block in the transaction history.\n\n# What's New in 4.2.8\n\n- Patch for Satochip v0.12 support #2410 (Toporin)\n- Add **smartBCH** LNS name lookup support #2414 (mainnet-pat, cculianu)\n  -  Register your LNS names here: https://app.bch.domains/\n  - You can use Electron Cash to send to LNS names (which resolve to BCH addresses) e.g. `calin.bch`\n- Build: Update the Wine build docker container to use the MSVC compiler (Axel Gembe)\n- Misc build fixups related to the addition of web3 support (cculianu)\n- wine-build: add workaround for installing pyinstaller (SomberNight)\n- Build: Patch pip vendored distlib to produce deterministic zip archives (Axel Gembe)\n- Build: Install a MSVC linker wrapper to make PE timestamps deterministic (Axel Gembe, cculianu)\n- CashFusion: Add 10BCH fusion tier (SahidMiller)\n- CTOR workaround: Always display receives before sends for the same block (cculianu)\n  - This avoids ever seeing *negative* temporary balances in the History Tab (which was a common complaint about the UI post-CTOR)\n- MacOS-build: Build custom pyinstaller from git (SomberNight, cculianu)\n- Update libsqlite3 version for AppImage #2435 (Axel Gembe)\n- Update bundled Tor to version 0.4.7.7 #2434 (Axel Gembe)\n- Update OpenSSL to version 1.1.1o #2437 (Axel Gembe)\n- Wine: Update to version 7.7 #2436 (Axel Gembe)\n- Network: Fix for incorrect usage of python when formatting an errmsg (cculianu)\n\n---\n\n## Download Notes\n\n- **`.AppImage`** is for any **Linux 64 bit** (it's a self-contained app bundle with everything inside) \n  - **Note**: Be sure to set this to executable to run it (`chmod +x`)\n- **`.dmg`** is for **macOS** (Mojave or above is required otherwise it may not run)\n- **`.exe`** is for **Windows**\n- **Srcdist** is provided as **`.tar.gz`** and/or **`.zip`** files \n  - Includes Python dependencies inside in `packages/`\n  - This is built on a **Linux 64-bit** system, and also includes `libsecp256k1.so.0` and the embedded `tor` static binary.\n- **ShaSums and Signatures:** Sha256 hashes and pgp signatures for the below release [are available here](https://github.com/Electron-Cash/keys-n-hashes/tree/master/sigs-and-sums).",

                    "response": "After researching for years and thinking about what the future of cryptocurrency will look like in the next decade. I believe Bitcoin Cash is best positioned to become the next world reserve currency. As Elon Musk says, layer 1 scaling is necessary for a blockchain to scale and become massively adopted. Bitcoin Cash is one of the few crypto communities that actually have the right mindset when it comes to layer 1 scaling. Unfortunately big and reputable cryptocurrencies like BTC have lost their way and is stuck at 1 MB blocks forever. Ethereum does not use a UTXO technology so it doesn't work well for payments and recently they seem to be falling into the BTC mindset of not prioritizing layer 1 scaling. Dogecoin, Litecoin and others do not show interest in layer 1 scaling either. BSV has a horrible reputation that will be near impossible to recover from. Dash has potential but it has a smaller adoption and network effect when compared to BCH which is farther ahead. Monero will run into too many regulatory challenges and risks for mass adoption given its native privacy features.  \n\n\nWith all that said, BCH has the best shot at becoming the winner for the next world reserve currency. It shares the same mining infrastructure and limited coin supply as big daddy BTC, but unlike BTC, BCH actually can scale for the entire world to use. I am super excited to see it upgrade to 256 MB blocks in the near future which will give it the ability to process 1,000 transactions per second.  \n\n\nThis doesn't even go over all the other amazing development happening in the BCH ecosystem such as Smart BCH which gives Ethereum like smart contract functionality.  \n\n\nI am all in on BCH baby.",

If you trust literally no one, then I guess you would be in the category of stuffing all your cash under your mattress or I guess in modern terms you have all your crypto in a non-custodial wallet. I respect this decision and there is nothing inherently wrong with it, but you should also consider the trade offs when making a decision like this.  Just like with stuffing your cash in your mattress you don't get to participate in ways to grow your wealth, buying cds, bonds or stocks, or whatever other assets that will be in custody with an institution.  \n\n\nIn this particular scenario I have my Bitcoin Cash in custody with Gemini because I trust them and I am also earning 5.3% interest for taking the risk of lending. There is of course risk that Gemini gets hacked or goes bankrupt, and I have considered those risks and believe the 5.3% interest is worth the risk I am taking. The ones that took the risk will be rewarded with interest if they are lucky. Just like anything with life there is risk and reward, even when investing in a new asset class such as crypto. Everyone has to make the decision that they think is best for themselves.  \n\n\nNow just because I trust Gemini doesn't mean I trust all banks and institutions. That is far from the truth. For example, I would never ever in a million years store my crypto in Western Union Bank or some shady ass exchange.",

But no.\n\nIt boils down to who has the most guns.\n\nSee, you are trusting that the company won't steal your funds. That is your trade-off to make. I don't think it is wise as the list of exchanges that lost users funds is a very very long list. But, again, if you want to trust such a company that is your good right.  \nBut the important part is that it misses the point.\n\nGimini is an American company and they will freeze your funds if the government asks about it. They have done so in the past (for Russians and Canadians) and will do it again the moment a judge tells them to.\n\nSo its not the company you trust, it is the US government. You trust that the US government doesn't decide that they will decide your money broke a law and can be confiscated. (yes, your money, not you). You trust that the US government will never want to openly fight against crypto which is undermining their power over the citizens. And you trust that we won't again see a bail-in when the real inflation starts.\n\nYou trust that the US government will fight fair, in short. And there is no evidence to support this.\n\nOr, in the words of Satoshi himself;\n\n> The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.\n> Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.\n\nTrust (the government) at your peril.",

Adoption is coming quickly, in a few months you'll have a lot more vendors to choose from to spend your Bitcoin Cash.",
