I still prefer it over robinhood because you can actually make more than 3 trades every 5 days and you actually own the coins, but yeah they need to add that shit. Also the notifications don't work and the 24 hour net gain/loss is often inaccurate. And binance doesn't bother to fix it. It's like they went out of their way to make the binance US app shittier than the regular binance app. I end up using the regular binance app for notifications and for charts.",
