Yesterday was the perfect day for Bitcoin to rise if it was going to, yet it lost 25 billion in market cap. That's incredibly significant. Money from Bitcoin appears to have been shuffled to the stock market. However, you're right in that we may see that change and as Nasdaq continues to tumble on Tuesday , Bitcoin could take the lead and that is surely the confirmation of a bubble bursting.",
