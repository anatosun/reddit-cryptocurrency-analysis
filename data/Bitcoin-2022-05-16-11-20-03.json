            "selftext": "Hey guys, I was wondering since there are more and more crypto casinos (you've probably noticed that), how are you dealing with taxes for Bitcoin, how does that work? I've never used any of this crypto gambling stuff, but I'm willing to try.   \n\n\nAnd what's the deal with the fact that many of these crypto gambling/casino platforms are forbidden in many countries, what's the exact reason for that?  \n\n\nI'm curious as well do these casinos maybe use something for data protection of their users since I learn a lot about it, I dunno am I even willing to try if I don't feel secure, I know a lot of companies use Modex or similar stuff for data protection which starts to be necessary for users to feel comfortable (yup, I'm one of these paranoid guys lol).   \n\n\nAs I've heard the type of tax you have to pay will depend on your income. Another interesting thing about it is that majority, use Bitcoin without paying taxes, and some even use it on purpose to not pay them. Is that really possible?   \n\n\nLook at this, what I've found:  \nCanada: Bitcoin tax-free gambling,  \nAustralia: Bitcoin tax-free gambling,  \nUK: Bitcoin tax-free gambling,  \nUS: Gambling winnings are subject to both Federal and State Income Tax.  \n\n\nCan someone pls explain to me, why in these countries users don't pay any taxes for crypto gambling?",

If you already have the core app then the wallet,dat is probably already in the correct place and the core app will load it up anyway.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it.\n\nWallet.dat in core app folder and then open/sync core app. Also it might take forever to sync if you have an old version of the app because they added something called header syncs a few years ago which really speeds it up.
