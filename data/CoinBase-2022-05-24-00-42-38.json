It says my account should be active no later than \\~24 hours later.\n\nI wasn't doing any abnormal activity.. just bought more BTC/ETH then withdrew to my cold wallet and then suddenly I couldn't deposit money or do anything else and then I was signed out of my account.\n\nWill update y'all tomorrow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: My account is verified and has been verified since 2013. I've transacted several hundred thousand through my account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: May 24 @ 4:43PM PST Account automatically unlocked as stated in the message saying when it would be unlocked.",
