My bet is taxes go up, but with anonymity, \"What capital gains, sir?\" So they begin buying up BTC by any means. Well by the nature of deflation, in this scenario government spending actually benefits the citizens by driving up the value of BTC. For once in human history, government spending will actually be good for the public. But unlike history they will only have so much access to said spending. By the time these things begin, I imagine the real struggles for resources will begin. Wars will start just for water and food. Hundreds, if not thousands, of wallets and keys will be lost. Inflation will hit new highs, the call for decentralized, deflationary currency will grow stronger. If not Bitcoin, some other type of crypto. Though according to what little I truly understand, it would take one hell of a code to top what BTC is doing. \n\nTl;dr: Shit hits the fan. BTC go up. Big big moneys.",

If you are trying to beat inflation well you would have been much better over the last year just buying U.S dollars (which are liquid in some fashion in most of the world).  If you are poor its much better to buy things like rice, beans, fix your roof and get an education as these all are going to have predictable and solid returns in an inflationary environment.   If you are very wealthy investing in supplying the goods that are in extremely high demand right now (ant thus inflation) will get plenty of returns.  Sure they could store it in bitcoin but its much better to have your money work for you at that level.  If you are young, middle class and dont have enough money to invest but have more than enough to pay your expenses then yeah I could see people going into bitcoin as its a high risk high reward system right now and only a certain demographic (the same that trade stocks really) can take advantage of it.  I can because I can lose it all and still be fine.  If I had kids I wouldn't touch it within a mile and just buy bonds.",
