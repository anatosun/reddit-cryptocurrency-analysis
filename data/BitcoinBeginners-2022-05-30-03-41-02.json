                    "response": "There is no best wallet. There are different wallets with different strengths and tradeoffs and many people use multiple wallets . You want an open source wallet that is popular  with a lot of support. Here are the ones that are recommended for beginners  -\n**Best wallets for securing small amounts of BTC**\n\n**electrum** For Desktop and Android\n\nPros= Great Desktop and Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control \n\nCons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets, make sure you only upgrade from official sources like play store or https://electrum.org as malicious servers or adverts can tell you to upgrade malware from other sites\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4EhZg5QslI\n\n**Phoenix** LN wallets for Android\n\nPros- Lightning network integration(as well as onchain) allowing you to spend with LN merchants for instant confirmations and much lower fees. Easiest lightning wallet to use\n\nCons- Lightning is still somewhat experimental. slightly higher fees than eclair to provide extra services and liquidity  .\n\nhttps://phoenix.acinq.co/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx5PK1H5OR0\n\n**\u00c9clair** LN wallets for Android and desktop\n\nPros- Lightning network integration(as well as onchain) allowing you to spend with LN merchants for instant confirmations and much lower fees\n\nCons- Lightning is still somewhat experimental. more complicated to use than phoenix  . Other Lightning wallets - http://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq4lF2s4UtI\n\nhttps://acinq.co\n\n\n**Blockstream Green Wallet** IOS and android wallet\n\nPros- Great UX, easy hardware wallet and full node integration, RBF, HW wallet support and advanced 2fa options\nCons- Until single signature is released 2 of 2 multisig means that one must depend upon blockstream\u2019s server for tx signing. Other light wallets are dependent upon other servers as well but light wallets like electrum allow you to swap servers. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO3Zi9D5b0Y\n\nhttps://blockstream.com/green/\n\n**Securing Larger amounts of Bitcoin (1k USD and more)**\n\n**ledger nano S wallet** = ~68 USD https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1OntWB7wc\n\n\n**trezor one wallet** = ~54 USD  https://shop.trezor.io\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT1j_kbZBEo\n\n\n**Trezor Model T** = ~164 USD  https://shop.trezor.io\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3BIo5Ac_n4\n\n**ColdCard Hardware wallet** = 119.97 USD https://store.coinkite.com/store/coldcard\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kocEpndQcsg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8dBNrlwJ0k\n\n**Digital Bitbox 02** = 109 USD  https://shiftcrypto.ch/bitbox02/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdP_7LgZw7s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nRq2OEhiw\n\n**Best Advanced Bitcoin Wallet= Bitcoin Core**\n\nPros= Great privacy and security \n\nCons= UX is for more experienced users, takes ~week to sync and requires ~5GB minimum disk space if prunned\n\nhttps://bitcoincore.org/en/download/\n\n**Best High Privacy Bitcoin Wallet = Wasabi**\n\nPros= Best Privacy with Chaumian CoinJoin built in \n\nCons= mixing coins costs more fees and for more advanced users \n\nhttps://www.wasabiwallet.io/#download\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECQHAzSckK0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPKpC9cRcZo&list=PLmoQ11MXEmahCG1nkbKK6DiAwVx9giJCi\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8wQK-Ndl3Q&list=PLPj3KCksGbSaEmjU0sywoTYDVYYSu8LsS\n\n\n\n\n**Most Secure and Most Private hot wallet** For Advanced Users. \n\nFull Node + Hardware Wallet + Metal mnemonic Backup.\n\nThis is Typically done with Electrum Personal Server + Hardware wallet(Ledger or trezor) + Electrum\n\nhttps://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server \n\nhttps://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005161925-Set-up-and-use-Electrum\n\nhttps://blog.trezor.io/using-trezor-with-electrum-v3-a0b9bcffe26e\n\nTesting different metal Backups -\n\nhttps://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test/\n\nhttps://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test--part-ii-/\n\nhttps://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test-round-iii/",

                    "response": "\"Best\" is subjective. It's like asking which car is the best. Here's a rough overview:\n\nSoftware wallets. Bitcoin Core is the best in terms of security. It's the most reviewed piece of software, verifies the blockchain, etc. Then there's Wasabi Wallet which is a bit more advanced, but helps your privacy like no other wallet. But... Neither of them works on mobile, so in terms of mobility you'll want something like Samourai Wallet or Green Wallet. If you want LN there's Breez. Mobile wallets typically sacrifice a little bit of security and privacy though.\n\nHardware wallets. There's Coldcard, Trezor and Ledger. All are good, there are slight differences in how they handle security, but overall you'll be fine with any of them.\n\nSo there's plenty of great wallets out there, it really depends on your needs. If you just want to hodl get a hardware wallet. If you want to transact in bitcoin start small with any reputable software wallet, get comfortable with it, and then see if there's something better for your needs.",
