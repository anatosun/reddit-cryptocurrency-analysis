Whereby an authorized dealer can swap your frame for the same or similar OR they reserve the right to repair it. How? TIG welding. \n\nProblem is, the frame warranty does not cover any damage incurred from \u201cjumps\u201d and/or normal use wear and tear. It\u2019s strictly defects that appear down the line.\n\nDefinitely start at the dealer level, see what they say. I jumped straight to the weld, because I don\u2019t know that a mountain bike dealer/manufacturer is going to see the crack and not have a good idea of how it happened. Base your conversation around this knowledge & I hope they do swap it for you!",
