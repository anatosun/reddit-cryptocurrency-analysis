            "selftext": "Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, assists his favorite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin, in gaining traction. On Friday AM ET, the billionaire said on Twitter that items for SpaceX, his space exploration company, would soon be available for purchase using Dogecoin, just as it is for Tesla.\n\nCryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly popular as a means of payment. According to a recent Visa poll, small business owners in nine different countries are eager to accept digital currencies as payment options,\" he noted. On July 1, the value of Dogecoin increased by 7%, thanks to two tweets from Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk. On the other hand, two other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ether, traded down.\n\nTesla does not accept Dogecoin for electric vehicles, although the largest meme coin may theoretically be used to purchase an electric vehicle. The meme token may be used to purchase Tesla's Cyberquad, a $1,900 quad bike built for kids. Faith Tribe, Threedium, Metaloop, MetaTokyo, and other cryptocurrencies can be used as collateral for cash loans.\n\nThe Shiba Inu, a Japanese breed dog, is featured on Dogecoin's emblem, based on the popular 'Doge' Internet joke. Dogecoin's proof-of-work methodology differs from Bitcoin's in various aspects, one of which is Scrypt technology.\n\nFollowing the tweet, the price of Dogecoin soared by as much as 10% to about 9 cents before settling at a gain of roughly 7.7%. Musk's revelation in December that Tesla products could be purchased with Dogecoin boosted DOGE values by up to 33%.",
