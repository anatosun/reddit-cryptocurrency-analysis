            "selftext": "Earlier this year (March 3rd) Wasabi Wallet announced that \"the zkSnacks coordinator will start refusing certain utxos from registering to conjoins\". zkSnacks Ltd is the company running Wasabi Wallet. Meaning Wasabi Wallet will be analyzing its users bitcoin inputs and deciding- on undisclosed criteria/sanctions/blacklists- if they accept your bitcoin or not. This means that coinjoining with wasabiwallet has become like dealing with any other big Bitcoin company/exchange in the space complying with KYC/AML/sanctions- and everything that comes with blacklisting. This is the beginning of a slippery slope which can not be tolerated by any Bitcoiner who understands its consequences.\n\nChanging the following settings enables use of a different- and proper anonymous- coordinator. (SAKE) Making it possible to use Wasabi without any of the blacklists/censorship/surveillance etc.\n\n1- Open Wasabi + file-open-config file\n\n2- Change- *MainNetBackendUriV3: http://wasabiukrxmkdgveSkynjztuovbg43uxcbcxn6y2okcrsg7gb6jdmbad.onion/*\n\nTo- *MainNetBackendUriv3: http://sakeazyzcx6gcmyv7ijduvogwpieewsk6mrjzgxciu2x2sfsyij6ogid.onion/*\n\n3- Change- *MainNetFallbackBackendUri: https://wasabiwallet.io/*\n\nTo- *MainNetFallbackBackendUri: http://sakeazyzex6gcmyv7ijduvogwpieewsk6mrjzgxciu2x2sfsyij6ogid.onion/*\n\n4- Restart Wasabi",

            "selftext": "Recently, something got me thinking about the end-game: how Bitcoin will scale to be globally adopted as the world\u2019s digital gold or currency or reserve asset, with billions of users?\n\nThe answer is always a layer 2 protocol like Lightning on top of the base layer. Small, frequent transactions will take place on L2. Fast and nearly free. Base layer transactions are slower and more expensive so will be used only for infrequent large transactions and for opening and closing L2 channels. \n\nThis all makes sense but there is a problem, which is the 1MB block size on the base layer. It can only accommodate about 5 transactions per second. If we assume only 1 transaction per user per month, the network can only support 13M users. If half of all transactions were a new user opening their first L2 channel, it would take about 50 years to bring 4B people onto L2. This is way too slow when you look at the steep part of tech adoption s-curves. \n\nI am aware of the history of the block size wars, and that there is always a trade off: when you improve one aspect of the network, something else suffers. The most often cited reason to keep 1MB blocks is to ensure the decentralization of full nodes by allowing them to run on low-cost hardware and low-bandwidth connections. BUT, storage keeps getting cheaper and internet speeds keep improving. Where I live you can get unlimited data for an extra $15/mo. Nodes download 20GB/mo and upload 200GB/mo. This is equivalent to 1hr of Netflix per day. Why can\u2019t block size increase as these technologies get cheaper and faster? We\u2019ve had 1MB basically since the beginning and it hasn\u2019t changed in 13 years (not counting SegWit). \n\nThe alternative is that the Bitcoin base layer ends up being something that only the top 1% can use, and the rest (whom Bitcoin was supposed to help the most) are relegated to completely off-chain, custodial solutions with many of the same drawbacks that the current system has. Centralization, censorship, seizure, etc. \n\nThe only way around this is to increase the capacity of the base layer and I see no appetite for that. \n\nAm I missing something?\n\nUpdate:\n\nAfter reading all the comments, here are my new thoughts. \n\nHyperbitcoinizion may look like this. 99% of users use custodial wallets. If the custodian is trusted, insured, and audited to ensure 1:1 holding of Bitcoin to deposits then it reduces user counterparty risk. If the custodian is registered in some stable country friendly to innovative banking like Switzerland, then user funds are protected from confiscation by abusive governments. Also, since user wealth is denominated in BTC, they are protected from inflation in their local fiat (which is really a hidden tax on the poorest). On the L2 rails, they have access to the cheap fast global digitally native payment system. On-chain L1 transactions are expensive, and used primarily by corporations, institutions, nations, high-value tx.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some new innovation allows billions to open their own Lightning channels and self-custody within the current base layer block limitation.\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nThese new innovations may be \u201cchannel factories\u201d or \u201cinherited IDs\u201d",

So with a total non-witness blocksize of 1 million bytes we get a maximum of 12195 transactions. Assuming that all spent outputs were P2WPKH the witness part for each transaction consists of two pushes: one for the signature and one for the pubkey. These are around 72 bytes and 33 bytes long, and each need a length prefix of 1 byte. Additionally there is 1 byte witness version. So the total witness size is 108 bytes. With 3 MB of space in the witness block left, this brings us to about 27777 witnesses per block. So the limiting factor is the space in the non-witness part of the block, so that's the final number that we should consider.\n\n>Notice that I used the non-segwit serialization for the non-segwit part since that is what non-upgraded nodes will enfore. Notice also that this is an extreme example, since most transactions are not single-input-single-output. A corresponding non-segwit transaction would have a size of 192 bytes, which, together with the 1MB size limit brings us to 5208 transactions per block, **compared to 12195 max segwit transaction per block.**\n\n>The second part of your question regarding maximum UTXO in a block is rather easy. We'd like to amortize the overhead from the transaction structure, and maximize inputs + outputs. Since inputs are larger than outputs we will simple use a single input and compute the **maximum number of outputs that fits in a block which is 32256.** Since the outputs are non-segwit data, it also changes minimally from before the segwit activation (only the signature from the one input is moved to the segwit part). Therefore the maximum UTXO churn is 1 UTXO gets removed, 32256 get added. For comparison, without segwit the maximum number added was 32252. Notice that there may be other limits that I haven't considered, but this definitely are the upper limits, and these limits are unlikely to have changed during the activation of segwit.\n\n**12195/600 = 20 TPS for 10 minute average blocks max**\n\n**32256/600 = 53.76 TPS for 10 minute average blocks max for maximum batching in a block**\n\nOf course you know as well as I do Blocks are often found quicker than 10 minutes so these TPS numbers are variable and sometimes it will be higher than this**(and lower at times of course!)**. Also this doesn't include tx throughput on other layers which allows for millions of TPS.",

To be completely fair it's probably a little under 10 mins as the general trend is for mining power to grow.\n\nThat said, even if we take the max of 53 TPS, that's 1.671bn TX's a year. There are 7.9bn people on earth. If all on-chain transactions other than lightning channel opening/closing stops, we can onboard 1.67bn people a year with optimum batching, and it will take ~4.72 years for everyone to open *one* lightning channel. This assumes nobody ever closes one, or wants more than 1 channel.\n\nObviously we're a long way from wanting to do that. But my point is that even with L2, there will come a time where the base layer will need to increase it's TX capacity if we want world adoption.",

Very few people will actually be opening and closing channels themselves.\n\nSimilar to how now even though millions of people are using Bitcoin on-chain, [there's only about 50 thousand Bitcoin nodes](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/historical.html)",

If the custodian is trusted, insured, and audited to ensure 1:1 holding of Bitcoin to deposits then it reduces user counterparty risk. If the custodian is registered in some stable country friendly to innovative banking like Switzerland, then user funds are protected from confiscation by abusive governments. Also, since user wealth is denominated in BTC, they are protected from inflation in their local fiat (which is really a hidden tax on the poorest). On-chain L1 transactions are expensive, and used primarily by corporations, institutions, nations, high-value tx. \n\nAlternatively, maybe some new innovation allows billions to open their own Lightning channels and self-custody with the current base layer block limitation.",
