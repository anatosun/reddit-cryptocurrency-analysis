            "selftext": "Recently, something got me thinking about the end-game: how Bitcoin will scale to be globally adopted as the world\u2019s digital gold or currency or reserve asset, with billions of users?\n\nThe answer is always a layer 2 protocol like Lightning on top of the base layer. Small, frequent transactions will take place on L2. Fast and nearly free. Base layer transactions are slower and more expensive so will be used only for infrequent large transactions and for opening and closing L2 channels. \n\nThis all makes sense but there is a problem, which is the 1MB block size on the base layer. It can only accommodate about 5 transactions per second. If we assume only 1 transaction per user per month, the network can only support 13M users. If half of all transactions were a new user opening their first L2 channel, it would take about 50 years to bring 4B people onto L2. This is way too slow when you look at the steep part of tech adoption s-curves. \n\nI am aware of the history of the block size wars, and that there is always a trade off: when you improve one aspect of the network, something else suffers. The most often cited reason to keep 1MB blocks is to ensure the decentralization of full nodes by allowing them to run on low-cost hardware and low-bandwidth connections. BUT, storage keeps getting cheaper and internet speeds keep improving. Where I live you can get unlimited data for an extra $15/mo. Nodes download 20GB/mo and upload 200GB/mo. This is equivalent to 1hr of Netflix per day. Why can\u2019t block size increase as these technologies get cheaper and faster? We\u2019ve had 1MB basically since the beginning and it hasn\u2019t changed in 13 years (not counting SegWit). \n\nThe alternative is that the Bitcoin base layer ends up being something that only the top 1% can use, and the rest (whom Bitcoin was supposed to help the most) are relegated to completely off-chain, custodial solutions with many of the same drawbacks that the current system has. Centralization, censorship, seizure, etc. \n\nThe only way around this is to increase the capacity of the base layer and I see no appetite for that. \n\nAm I missing something?",

                    "response": "You make valid points. Back during the block wars the big blocker argument wasn\u2019t completely outlandish. At the time it was the simplest path to a scaling solution when the network became backed up and fees skyrocketed. Lightning was still very much a security risk with hardly a beta platform to test. Today, many improvements in lightning, but still much to see proven out. Meanwhile bcash is actually still functioning with low fees and fast txns, has developed quite a bit with smartbch, but still faces plausible long term security issues with limited hash rate compared to btc and a minuscule amount of functional nodes on the network. I always thought had the 2 sides found a way to work together that the outcome would have been strongest, and in hindsight that may have been true. Even scaling block size in a very small incremental fashion that sacrifices very little security considering hash has only risen, and meanwhile developing layer 2 lightning for micropayments at same time, would have resulted in an interesting hybrid. Bcash was hammered hard in image, but most those devs were OG bitcoiners too, people forget that. Makes you wonder if things would be better had they all landed in compromise. Wasn\u2019t possible, greed was blinding everyone way more than \u201cthe white paper\u201d and all that. But anyways, most crypto chatter in this sub and in general today simply revolves around speculative price and dreams of hyperbitcoinization. Meanwhile, the majority hanging here have never sent crypto anywhere, or ever bought a single thing with it. Far cry from back in early 2015 when I started getting into all of this. Thanks for posting an interesting topic of discussion. My hopes is that lightning proves out, and I\u2019m confident regardless that bitcoin will find a way.",

Very few people will actually be opening and closing channels themselves.\n\nSimilar to how now even though millions of people are using Bitcoin on-chain, [there's only about 50 thousand Bitcoin nodes](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/historical.html)",

How many users will pick up the less secure but more convenient?).\n\nSame is happening in the Crypto space. It is becoming just a buzzword. People want crypto, but they dont want to use crypto. Nice example is current NFT market. It become mainstream as a crypto assets. Yet most of the users trade them via binance and opensea. So in reality they dont own any of these assets. And they dont even look at the blockchain, but look at information provided by opensea. The whole \"decentalized\" crypto market is getting more and more centralized and ridiculous.",

Why would I want to coinjoin with UTXOs from addresses that are sanctioned by the US?\n\n>Wasabi Wallet has become a surveillance instrument\n\nHow can Wasabi Wallet be a surveillance instrument when Wasabi and the zkSnacks coordinator don't know which UTXOs belong to who?\n\n>This means that coinjoining with wasabiwallet has become like dealing with any other big Bitcoin company/exchange in the space complying with KYC/AML/sanctions\n\nWasabi Wallet doesn't do any KYC/AML. It doesn't ask for your name or personal information. I'm sure Wasabi complies with US sanctions.",
