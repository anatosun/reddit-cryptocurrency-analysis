I have done this before using electrum and ended up having to lookup the correct derivation path. As well some software wallets use a proprietary seed and derivation path and will only work with that wallet software. These wallets should be avoided as it's best to use an open source hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet the uses a BIP39 word list.",
