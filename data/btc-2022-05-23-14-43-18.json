Im sure theres a lot of people on the fence. I guess it all depends on your disposition. If you have heavy BCH bags, of course you feel affronted by what Im saying.\n\nI really wish BCH would simmer down and that energy would concentrate into Monero. We are better united. And Monero is objectively a better coin to unite under, for privacy, decentralization, its strong brand, track record, and trajectory, its strong adoption especially in DNMs, etc...\n\nTry to look at this problem as a fellow libertarian, rather than as an ideological BCHer.\n\nIts really fair at this point, 4/5 years into the BCH Bitcoin-takeover attempt, with all the price, market cap, and ranking it has bled off, to reconsider it as ones primary vehicle of libertarian crypto rebellion. It feels like it was yesterday when BCH was top 3, then top 5, then top 10... Now its not even top 20. And its only ~2x its absolute USD all-time-low, extreme underperformance by our market's standards",
