I invested in a crypto mining company and when it was time to pay my profits, I was forced to sign up for Coinbase Wallet and the profits were deposited into my wallet.  When I tried to send ETH to my regular crypto wallet the transaction is only pending and will not move from my coinbase wallet.  Then I received a message from someone telling me I needed to $5000 for a 16 digit pin (private key) in order to have access to my funds. I know my wallet already comes with a private key. But I do not have access to my funds without paying this person thousands of dollars who claims the work for coinbase.  Can you help me please ?",

If you want to mine crypto you buy a machine and plug it into a wall.  \n\nAlso, don't ever give anyone your seed phrase or send money to a wallet whose seed phrase you do not control.  Whoever has the seed to the account is the owner of the account.  \n\nYou got scammed, learn from your mistake, cut your losses and move on.  Anyone claiming they can assist is just another con artist attempting to scam you further",
