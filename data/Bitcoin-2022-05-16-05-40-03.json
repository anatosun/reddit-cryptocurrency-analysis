You could never repeat the fair start and distribution, Satoshi's early step down, decentralization, track record, network effect. Even without getting into the technicals on which all \"cryptos\" fail (POW is the only option, POS is fiat; chain size must be kept small, scaling has to happen via 2nd layers etc, block time can't be too fast; rules and supply have to be consistent; etc.), the global reserve asset/money has to be dependable and durable, so if Bitcoin ever got replaced the game's over anyway, because no successor would be expected to hold up.",
