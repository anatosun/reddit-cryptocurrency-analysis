Alts can still keep bleeding. \nMaybe even 40% more. \n\nI also wouldn\u2019t just forget for 20years. \n\nCrypto is so early right now that most of its price is driven by emotion. Not really the technology behind it. \n\nSo we get huge swings. \n\nSome projects were basically back to 2020 prices. And if you didn\u2019t take any profits between 2020 and now you lost a lot of profits. \n\nHODLing is cute to scream but you\u2019re missing out in so much opportunity. \n\nSell profits, keep some for your self and hold on to most of those profits to rebuy once it dips. Which inevitably it will again",
