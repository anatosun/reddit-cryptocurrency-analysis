The token increased by nearly 60% in the space of a few hours after Binance's listing went live earlier Friday. Nexo has since retreated to trade at around $2.33, but is still up 6% over the last 24 hours. The token's market capitalization is $1.3 billion.\n\nPablo J\u00f3dar, financial products manager at Storm Partners, a systems provider for the cryptocurrency space in Europe, said Nexo got a positive tailwind from the recent partnership announcement with Mastercard (MA). The credit card company unveiled a crypto-backed payments card that allows users to spend without having to sell their digital assets including NFTs when they're on sale in marketplaces like Foundation, Rarible, Solsea or Plastiks. They also offer customers 2% cash back on their transactions.\n\n\u201cThis partnership puts Nexo a step closer to becoming a crypto bank to help retail clients access the digital space,\u201d J\u00f3dar said.\n\n\u201cThis was also a positive week for the crypto-lending space, as Goldman Sachs [GS] announced [it] executed the first fiat loan\u201d backed by bitcoin (BTC), J\u00f3dar said. \"It shows a very strong interest from Wall Street banks to adopt crypto assets as a new type of alternative assets.\u201d\n\nDo you agree with Goldman? Could this bring a crypto lending space progress?",

Additionally, other currencies which followed Binance are Coinbase (COIN) at $81.9 billion (down 12%) and OKX with $75.9 billion (down 26%). \nFlorian Giovannacci who is the head of trading at Covario, the Swiss-based digital asset prime broker also stated that Binance has had a significant market share for quite some time. She included that they are very reliable (technically), cover a large array of tokens and offer some of the best liquidity, which attracts volume.\nAccording to data gotten from Messari, the price of bitcoin (BTC) reached a monthly high of $48,214 in March. Additionally, at press time, bitcoin was trading at around $38,900, down 19% since the March high. But according to market statistics, the 30% dominance in March is just marginally below Binance\u2019s record market share of 34% which was reached in November 2021 and the increase in the derivative market by 4.6% to $2.74 trillion is still significantly lower than the all-time highs reached in May 2021.\nHowever, Binance also led the derivative markets with 52% of total volumes in March which was followed by other cryptocurrencies like Faith Tribe, OKX and Bybit.",

Kirill Malofeyev, the son of Konstantin Malofeyev, a Russian tycoon previously accused of breaking US sanctions. He was also prohibited, according to the business. In a Friday Twitter post, Mykhailo Fedorov, the Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine and also one of the major leaders behind the government's pro-cryptocurrency attitude, acknowledged Binance's bans. He also added that \"everyone affiliated with Putin's administration will face the effects of the war.\"\n\nThe news broke as Binance has been working harder to cope with restrictions. Mainly they are fearful that Russians may use cryptocurrency to hide their money. Since its attack on Ukraine, Russia has been a major subject of sanctions storm. Even popular crypto companies like Binance have been actually pressured to exclude Russian customers. Following these unwanted contraints by goverments, many projects like Theta, The Graph , Point Network, and many more are trying to build a decentralized ecosystem which will be controlled autonomously by the people of its community, which cannot be blocked by any goverment.\n\nMoving forward, Binance has previously introduced a set of limitations for Russian nationals and citizens on April 21. They forbade transactions on accounts worth more than 10,000 euros or up to $10,800. Due to Western sanctions placed on Russia, CEO Changpeng Zhao has claimed that the business will cooperate with restrictions. He also said that they will not \"arbitrarily suspend millions of innocent customers' accounts.\"",

Moreover, as per Reuters' assessment of Kostarev's conversations, he \"agreed to Rosfin's demand to disclose customer data.\" He even added that he didn't have \"any kind of choice.\"\n\nAccording to Reports, simultaneously, Rosfinmonitoring was exploring ways to trace cryptocurrency payments to the groups of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. After his murder attempt and subsequent detention in Russia in January 2021, Navalny earned large donations from admirers, including a spike in fresh funding.\n\nLater on Friday, Binance published that \"recommendations that Binance discussed any user information, including Alexei Navalny's, with Russian FSB-controlled departments and Russian regulatory authorities are utterly false.\" And also said that \"Binance has not decided to seek valuable guidance and support the Russian state in its efforts to uncover Alexei Navalny.\"\n\nThe impact of the invasion.\n\nBinance has actively sought to become a legal part of Russia's cryptocurrency ecosystem before the Russian attack on Ukraine last winter.\n\n\"Long before the war with Ukraine, Binance, just like any other blockchain company engaged in Russia, was actively working for Russia to build an appropriate crypto policy structure - an endeavour we are conducting in every region we operate in,\" Binance stated in response to CoinDesk.\n\nBinance ceased taking payments using Visa as well as Mastercard bank cards issued by Russia when Visa and Mastercard itself disconnected Russian consumers from global money transfers following the invasion. This begs the question, isn\u2019t access to data the right of every human being? Then why are we biased about certain regions? This is the reason why I am very bullish on projects like Point Network, Polygon, Theta, and many such Web 3.0 initiatives that are making data accessible to all.",

The card is free, but refugees, even if they have fled the country, will need to authenticate their identification and utilize an existing Binance crypto wallet with a Ukrainian address or register a new account with a Ukrainian address, according to the business. \n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency exchange and the platform for blockchain project like DAODAO and Nature Vault is collaborating with European payments firm Contis to launch the card, which can be used in any country in the European Economic Area.\n\nThe \"Binance Refugee Crypto Card\" is the company's newest effort to assist those affected by the Ukrainian war, despite the fact that cryptocurrency in general has been condemned as a workaround that some allege has enabled sanctioned Russians dodge economic targeting by the West. \n\n\"At such a tough moment for Ukraine, it's evident that cryptocurrencies are valuable since they offer a fast, affordable, and safe way of transmitting funds to support people with their immediate financial needs,\" Helen Hai, head of Binance Charity, stated in a press statement. \n\nBinance pledged in February to provide at least $10 million through the Binance Charity Foundation to support children and families in Ukraine, as well as those who have fled to neighboring countries.\n\nAccording to a company press release, the millions will be given to philanthropic groups such as UNICEF, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, iSans, and People in Need. The bitcoin exchange also established a cryptocurrency crowdfunding portal, which has raised approximately $1 million in favor of Ukraine.\n\nOther cryptocurrency companies, such as the Bahamas-based FTX, have recently increased their efforts to assist those harmed by Russia's incursion. According to CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX offered $25 to each of its Ukrainian consumers in late February. \n\n\"Do what you gotta do,\" Bankman-Fried remarked at the time in a tweet. \n\nBinance's crypto card is another illustration of one of the many benefits of cryptocurrencies, according to proponents of the technology. Some charitable groups, individual persons, and the Ukrainian government have begun to accept cryptocurrency in an effort to receive donations fast that aren't complicated by relationships to third-party entities like banks.\n\nIn February, the Ukrainian parliament passed legislation legalizing cryptocurrencies. According to blockchain research firm Chainanalysis, the country has the greatest rate of crypto adoption in Europe and ranks fourth in the world in terms of crypto acceptance. \n\nAt the same time, some, such as U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, have argued that cryptocurrencies are actually assisting Ukraine's invaders by allowing sanctioned Russian leaders and oligarchs to avoid Western sanctions. Several industry participants, including the leaders of cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase, have denied this assertion.",

The Treasury Department of the United States sanctioned her, the next week.\n\nThe company closed Kovaleva's account on March 24, the same day she was sanctioned by the UK. Malofeev, who was designated by the US Treasury on April 20, had his Binance accounts blocked this week, according to the company. \n\nPeskova, Kovaleva, and Malofeev did not respond promptly to written demands for comment.\n\nFollowing the European Union's recent sanctions against Moscow, Binance said last week that it is restricting services in Russia, one of its largest markets globally. \n\nBinance has received praise from industry experts concerned about potential sanctions evasion through cryptocurrency as a result of the crackdown. However, it has sparked a response from others who believe the limits are excessive.",

According to Reuters' assessment of Kostarev's conversations, he agreed to Rosfin's request to disclose customer data, telling a colleague that he didn't have \"much of a choice.\"\n\nAccording to Reuters, at the same time, Rosfinmonitoring was exploring ways to trace cryptocurrency payments to the groups of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. After his murder attempt and subsequent detention in Russia in January 2021, Navalny earned millions in donations from supporters, including a spike in fresh funding.\n\nLater on Friday, Binance posted on its official blog that suggestions that Binance shared any user data, including Alexei Navalny's, with Russian FSB-controlled agencies and Russian regulators are categorically false, and that Binance has not sought to actively assist the Russian state in its efforts to investigate Alexei Navalny.\n\nAny government or law enforcement agency around the globe can now seek user data from Binance if they have the right to legal permission. Binance has not engaged into any type of arrangement with the Russian government that varies from any other jurisdiction - these duties are regular, and any traditional bank would be subject to the same regulations, Binance continued.\n\nDuring this power struggle companies like SET, ZeLoop, Plastiks, who work to create a positive impact on the environment can highly benefit by listing on these platforms and attracting new users by catching this trend. According to the statement, Binance will be sending an official complaint to Reuters under their own editorial standards.",

The Russian authorities requested names and addresses to assist them in investigating crimes.\n\nBinance handed over information to Russian authorities?\n\nThe incidents from April 2021, when Rosfinmonitoring or Rosfin, a Russian organization, was on the trail of huge amounts of money in Bitcoin. And that money was actually collected by imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. All this info was clearly detailed in the report. According to a person close to the situation, Navalny was utilizing the cash to support attempts to uncover corruption in the Vladimir Putin-led administration.\n\nGleb Kostarev, Binance's chief operating officer in Eastern Europe and Russia. He consented to supply Rosfin with the information requested, according to texts between Kostarev and also another business colleague. Kostarev explained to the colleague that he didn't have \"much of an option\" and that he had no choice but to comply. Kostarev did not answer when contacted. Binance, on either side, stated that Russian officials never tried to approach them about Navalny. They also stated that the communication was \"actively seeking adherence in Russia\" prior to the start of the conflict with Ukraine. That would have forced the interaction to accept \"appropriate demands from regulatory agencies and local police departments.\"\n\nAttempts behind the scenes to strengthen connections with the Russian government.\n\nAccording to the chat between Kostarev and the trade colleague, Binance intended to establish a relationship with the Russian authorities. Reporters actually questioned former workers, ex-business colleagues, and cryptocurrency industry officials. Even the text messages made by Kostarev to others outside the company were also scrutinized to substantiate the firm's behind-the-scenes operations.\n\nThat\u2019s not all, there are some other options available like Polygon, Point Network, and many more. Cryptonary, on the other side, has already stated that it plans to grow into Russia and surrounding nations despite the existing restrictions imposed on the country's banks and other businesses.",

The advantage of this is that it offers greater clearness, transparency, and predictability to the BNB population.\n\nBinance is also working actively on launching its NFT marketplace which can benefit many other existing projects, by enabling them to access BSC network.

What is Total PNL?\" as the given examples don't  appear to be using the correct math?\n\nFrom the page examples:\n\n>For example, here are the trade details of a BTCUSDT isolated pair:  \n>  \n>Date\tTrade\tQuantity\tExecution Price  \n>  \n>T+1\t\tBuy\t\t10 BTC\t\t30,000 USDT  \n>  \n>T+2\t\tSell\t\t7 BTC\t\t32,000 USDT  \n>  \n>T+3\t\tSell\t\t2 BTC\t\t33,000 USDT  \n>  \n>Assume the latest index price of BTCUSDT is 36,000.  \n>  \n>Net Buy Quantity = 10 - 7 + 2 = 5 BTC\n\nAccording to the info on the page:\n\n>\\*Net Buy Quantity = Quantity of Buy order position - Quantity of Sell positions (trade asset)\n\nI don't get how the example ends up at 5!?\n\nI  get that 10-7+2 is 5, sure... but if Net Buy Quantity is (Quantity of  Buy order position - Quantity of Sell positions) then why is the exmaple  showing 10 - 7 + 2?? Why is it minus 7, which is a sell order, but plus  2, which is also a sell order?\n\nSurely the above example, should be:\n\n10 - 9 | OR | 10 - (7 + 2) = 1\n\nRight?\n\nThen there is the \"Net Buy Market Value\"\n\n>Net Buy Market Value = 10\\*30,000 + 2\\*33,000 - 7\\*32,000 = 142,000\n\nagain, information provided:\n\n>Net Buy Market Value = Amount of buy orders traded - the number of sell orders traded (quote asset)\n\nI don't get how the example gets to 142,000?\n\nIf  \"Net Buy Market Value\" is mount of buy orders traded - the number of  sell orders traded then I don't get why the example is indicating  \"10\\*30,000 + 2\\*33,000 - 7\\*32,000\" - Why are we ADDING 2\\*33,000 - which  is a sell order - But we are taking away 7\\*32,000 - which is also a sell  order??\n\nSo, once again, shouldn't the \"Net Buy Market Value\" in the exmaple be:\n\n10 \\* 30,000 - 2 \\* 33,000 - 7 \\* 32,000 = 10,000\n\nOR\n\n10 \\* 30,000 - (2 \\* 33,000) - (7\\*32,000) = 10,000 ?\n\nAnd Finally the Total Profit / Loss\n\n>Total profit/loss = 5\\*36,000 - 142,000 = 38,000 USDT\n\nWith the info / calculation:\n\n>Total PNL is calculated as = Net Buy Quantity (of all previous trades)\\*Index Price - Net Buy Market Value\n\nThis  time, the calculation would seem to be operating on incorrect numbers  from the previous calculations, so if I'm right with the math above,  then this would be:\n\n1\\*36,000 - 10,000 = 26,000 ?\n\nAnd not the 38,000 that the example indicates?\n\nThe  information just doesn't make sense to me, and I can't work out if I've  just read the information wrong / mis-understood. Or if the example  math provided is just wrong and hasn't been checked?\n\nCan someone possibly help me understand this properly?\n\nEdit - Link to the page I'm referencing: [https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/66c9249262904132b40a9566b0c7ac24](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/66c9249262904132b40a9566b0c7ac24)",

According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled their nation since Russia commenced its war in late February. \n\nBinance, a cryptocurrency exchange and also an home to blockchain projects like DAODAO and Plastiks, announced Tuesday that it has introduced a card for Ukrainians who have fled their country due to Russia's invasion, claiming that blockchain-based currency is a good way to meet emergency financial demands.\n\nThe free Binance Refugee Crypto Card is for all current and new Binance users from Ukraine who've been forced to move to European Environment Agency Countries because of the war launched by Russia in late February. The EEA has 32 member countries and is an agency of the European Union.\n\nIn a statement, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange said that displaced Ukrainians can use the card to send and receive crypto payments, as well as make purchases at EEA merchants that accept card payments. \n\"At such a tough moment for Ukraine, it's evident that cryptocurrencies are valuable since they provide a fast, affordable, and safe way of transmitting funds to support individuals with their immediate financial needs,\" Helen Hai, the executive director of Binance Charity, said in a statement. New Binance users must fill out an application that follows the \"Know Your Customer\" criteria.\n\nAccording to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, more than 5 million people have fled Ukraine in pursuit of safety from Russia's invasion. Russia has attacked the capital city of Kyiv, as well as the coastal cities of Mariupol and Odesa, in its campaign against the former Soviet republic.\n\nThe Binance Charity donation platform is collaborating with non-profits to give crypto-based monetary assistance via a card that will allow relatives and acquaintances to send crypto to the cards and Binance wallets. \n\nRefugees who have applied for the card and have been confirmed by local non-profit groups will receive $75 in Binance USD cryptocurrency each month for three months. The BUSD cryptocurrency will be immediately translated to local currency during the card payment, according to the exchange. \n\nBinance announced last week that it would restrict services in Russia in order to comply with EU sanctions imposed on Moscow as a result of the invasion of Ukraine. The EU set a $10,000 ($10,700) limit on Russian payments to EU crypto wallets in order to prevent wealthier Russians from circumventing financial restrictions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine.",

            "selftext": "No one trusts the crypto community. Why should they? Majority of projects are rugpulled and investors are scammed on a daily basis. When will this stop? Do people need to start taking their own lives before someone does something about this? Below are four reasons why the community has deteriorated and a call to action/solution below that. \n\nReason 1, AMA Channels take money from developers for broadcast- Cost of AMA to developer: 2-14 BNB ($800-$6000) Process: for one hour the host asks questions/developer answers over voice/video. Potential/current investors ask questions at the end. Some examples on telegram: GodReviews charges 4 BNB, Caesars\\_Calls, 10 BNB, GollumsGems 10BNB,etc \u201cwe do unbiased reviews/ask hard questions and do your own research\u201d are common statements by AMA team. AMA team takes money from developers naturally taking developer side, forgetting investors. Reason for high price: most effective way to advertise a new token. Regardless of project quality, very likely the price will go up shortly before/during/shortly after project\u2019s AMA with highly followed AMA group.\n\nReason  2: Audit Companies take money from projects for audits: Companies like Coinscope and Certik charge developers $2000 for audit. Funded by developers, this is always a conflict of interest for the auditing agency, especially with no guarantees for money back to investors. Recently three highly rated projects audited by Certik got rugpulled: Coyote Coin, Elephant Money and Safuu. Certik pointed out vulnerabilities, but what projects do not have vulnerabilities pointed out? Paying for someone to state something is of high quality is advertising, not an inspection/audit\n\nLet\u2019s pause and talk about micro-worker companies. These include websites like picoworkers, rapidworkers, timebucks and microworkers. Breakdown: \u201cEmployer\u201d paypals $25 to the website and then provides instructions for 500 people from a third world country to \u201cupvote\u201d, \u201clike\u201d, \u201cfollow\u201d, \u201cshare\u201d, \u201cjoin\u201d, etc. 500 people earn 5 cents to upload proof of work screenshot. Repeat process x number of times. Depending on country/region, many are overworked 14 hours a day, less than $150 a month full time job. YouTube companies for more info.  Development teams use these to inflate their numbers. Don\u2019t believe me? Read on\u2026  \nReason 3: Developers use microworker companies to Inflate upvotes, followers, telegram membership numbers/comments/likes: Coinsniper, coinscope, coinhunters, nextcoin, coinalpha, freshcoins, coinvote, coinfair, watcher, coinmooner, coincyclop are upvote websites. At the time of this post I did a simple experiment, visited coinscope website and sampled top voted token. Project name: Puli\\_Token ($PULI). Before I make the below statements, I must give the disclaimer: I have not looked at the project\u2019s utility, or smart contract, not inferring this is a scam project or to avoid. Sorry Puli\\_token devs, you were at the top on coinscope during my research and your numbers don\u2019t make sense, so you get to be my not so good guinea pig. (again I did not search long for this, it was literally the first project opened)\n\nTo continue my point: 100,924 votes on coinscope at this time, yet only 437 members on subreddit, 46,200 twitter followers  and 18,858 members in telegram. Besides the fact that these numbers are very lopsided (why only 437 in reddit?), simple addition from all communities, (65,495) does not come anywhere near 100,924 (you can only vote once). How many are the same individuals from different platforms? \n\nAdditionally, 46k followers on twitter with only 119 comments/254 retweets/366 likes on their most recent posts in three days does not add up. My evaluation: the development team used microworkers to inflate coin upvote, twitter  following, and telegram members. Then did not pay attention to detail/cheaped out inflating tweets to match. Is 437 reddit members the actual following for this project?\n\nReason 4: micro-task companies used on Crypto Info pages as well: have you looked at a subreddit like cryptomoonshots lately? 1.7 million members?!. Yet drastic comment variation: post with zero comments to a few thousand upvotes with only 13 comments including a very sharp change between two posts, showing 24 comments on top screen and only 4 comments inside (microworker comments that are blocked showing artificial inflation).\n\nAdditionally, getting access to the views chart, I would be willing to bet money it went from zero upvotes one minute, 2000 votes next minute to 0 votes again. How can this be possible? Again, developer employing a microworker company to inflate numbers. When the job comes into picoworkers, it typically gets executed very quickly creating a quick spike followed by no activity. Compare cryptomoonshots posts/participation to a legit subreddit like r/CryptoCurrency. CryptoCurrency has an even distribution of upvotes and comments. Typically, there are more comments than upvotes and they happen very gradually. When I post on r/CryptoCurrency I usually see 30k views. The moderators of a subreddit like cryptomoonshots wont let me post there, because they know I will see that not one person looked at my post because they are all microworkers that just followed. Intent for mods? Scam to charge new developers money to post their project in a group of 1.7m fake members that wont do anything.\n\nCall to Action: \n\nThe above current system encourages everyone to invest in a project that can pay their way to the top. It steals opportunities away from developers that are bright and talented, with great ideas.\n\nSolution:\n\n1. If an AMA team accepts money from the project for broadcast, don\u2019t listen or join them. If you do join, calmly raise your hand and ask the question on how much the development team paid to have the AMA. r/CryptoCraversLLC does free AMAs. Developers can reach out, but since this is free, don\u2019t be surprised if we upset you with our line of questions. \n\n2. If you know audit company charged developers for audit, ask for re-audit from someone who they did not pay/is unbiased. If rugpulls happen after an audit, spread the word to other communities that use the same audit company.\n\n3.  Don\u2019t look at upvote companies unless they have anti-microtask worker protocols in place. If they are mentioned, stone wall comment that all upvote companies are a scam unless there are clear anti-microworker protocols in place. Voice your opinion on social media platforms that are scams. Report them to the social media platform if something does not look right, don't turn a blind eye. \n\nFinally, please share/voice this posts information to inform and educate the crypto community: let's start a revolution! put all of these companies out of business and change this space together!",

            "selftext": "Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) are gradually becoming a popular method of purchasing and selling digital assets that have value, ranging from art to music to tweets and even memes. Many creators have been able to monetize their creativity and talent, while collectors have been able to discover a more safe way to purchase and preserve their goods. \n\nAccording to Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics business, non-fungible tokens are one of the fastest-growing areas in the crypto industry, with the NFT market expected to reach slightly over $41 billion by the end of 2021. To trade these asset kinds, you must first grasp what they are and how they might be employed.\n\nCryptographic tokens called Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are connected to digital or tokenized copies of physical things. They also act as proof of ownership for the content because they are non-interchangeable. Fungibility refers to the interchangeability and indistinguishability of an asset's units. For example, most currencies (including cryptocurrencies) are interchangeable. \n\nA genuine 100 dollar note or other denominations can be exchanged for a 100 dollar note. This is critical for an asset that is intended to be used as a means of exchange. This does not apply to NFTs, which distinguishes them. This is due to the fact that no two NFTs are alike or divisible, giving owners exclusive rights to an asset that cannot be duplicated.\n\nBecause there is no fixed price for NFTs, their prices are determined by demand and the supply chain. The value placed on NFTs by humans \u2013 buyers and sellers \u2013 determines their price. \n\nThis is not an unusual occurrence, as it already occurs with collectibles and artwork. It's also vital to remember that NFTs can't be reproduced or transferred without the owner's authorization - even if the NFT is issued by the same company. \n\nTo control and standardize their issuance, NFTs are issued on many blockchains. The most prominent blockchain is Ethereum's ERC-721 standard, but there are others as well, including Solana, Quint, NEO, Tezos, and many others. Binance's BNB Chain features its own NFT standards, which are similar to Ethereum's but more appealing to creators looking to mint NFTs at a cost substantially lower than Ethereum.\n\nNFTs are gaining more momentum every day as money becomes less valuable. People are turning to newer ways to store wealth and the next viable alternative is blockchain, which is the future of the financial system.\n\nWith NFTs, collectors can purchase digital assets stored in a blockchain and expect their value to increase in the future as a means of growing wealth and enjoying the freedom of money; and for artists and creators, it presents an opportunity to have access to a much wider market to sell content and artworks to collectors at a good value.",

Changpeng Zhao, often known as \"CZ,\" the company's CEO, confirmed the news on Twitter in a series of messages.\n\n86 Binance accounts were mainly used to disburse the funds.\n\nAccording to a prior post from Cryptonary, Ronin Bridge, an Ethereum sidechain for Axie Infinity members, was actually hacked. And that results in a loss of around 173,600 ETH or $600 million and USDC 25.51 million or $25.5 million due to a security flaw. This is the largest DeFi hack so far, and it has established a precedent for future incidents like it. Zhao did not name the eighty-six accounts that might have been even implicated in the cybercrime. \n\nHowever, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation announced last week that hackers associated with the Lazarus Group. It is even believed that North Korea actually sponsors the group. As a result, the company was responsible for the loss of $621 million in bitcoin from Axie Infinity. Axie Infinity is basically a non-fungible token-based gameplay platform. It allows participants to earn in-game cash that can be actually exchanged for real money. \n\nIn early April, hackers attacked Axie Infinity's blockchain platform, Ronin Network. This platform permits users to transfer cryptocurrency in and out of gaming. You may utilize systems like Polygon, Point Network, Terra, and others for enhanced data security. \n\nIs North Korea to blame for the attack?\nThe North Korean hacker outfit Lazarus was actually revealed to be the true perpetrator of the Ronin Bridge breach. This was even stated in a previous article by Cryptonary. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the FBI suspects such breaches are a source of cash for North Korea's Kim Jong Un-led leadership. However, Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, is working to retrieve the stolen assets.",

In a tweet, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stated that $741,840,738 worth of #BNB will be removed from circulation soon. The burn would cost $403 per BNB, according to the report.\n\nThe BNB Chain ecosystem is powered by BNB, the native coin of the BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain. Following its ICO in 2017, Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange, published it. BNB uses an auto-burn technique to reduce its total supply to 100,000,000 BNB. \n\nThe auto-burn mechanism adjusts the quantity of BNB to be burned based on the price of BNB and the number of blocks generated on the BNB Smart Chain throughout the quarter. Nonetheless, data shows that an estimated 1.8 million BNB will be destroyed in the coming quarter, with an August deadline. Besides that, Deedy and  Superate has risen 4.9 percent in the previous 24 hours to $419.\n\nCoinDesk is a news organization that strives for the highest journalistic standards and follows a strict set of editorial guidelines. It's the go-to place for news and information about cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and the future of money. CoinDesk, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, is a self-contained operating company that invests in cryptocurrencies and blockchain startups.\n\nCertain CoinDesk employees, such as editorial staff, may receive DCG ownership in stock appreciation rights, which vest over a multi-year period as part of their remuneration. DCG shares cannot be purchased outright by CoinDesk journalists.\n\nAccording to Glass node, during another two months of sideways consolidation, a large portion of the market is unwilling to spend and sell their coins, even though they are retained at a loss. Above the $40,000 price mark, price-insensitive traders possess a big share of bitcoin's supply.\n\nLike ethereum and even newer projects like Plastiks, many other projects are adopting strategic burns to build uniqueness and raise their value over time.",

Changpeng Zhao, often known as 'CZ', the company's CEO, confirmed the news on Twitter in a series of messages.\n\nRonin Bridge, an Ethereum sidechain for Axie Infinity users, was stolen, according to a previous report from Kripteu Magazine. As a result, in a loss of about 173,600 ETH and 25.5 million USDC owing to a vulnerability. This is the most significant DeFi hack yet, and it has established a precedent for future instances. \n\nThe monies were reportedly laundered via Tornado Cash, making it impossible for blockchain specialists to monitor the data. Tornado Cash received about 21,000 ETH, with a portion of the funds put on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. According to Zhao, the monies were allocated to over 86 Binance accounts. \n\nToday, the DPRK hacking squad started transferring their stolen Axie Infinity monies. Binance received a share of the money distributed over 86 accounts. The amount recovered was $5.8 million. This is something we've done before for other initiatives, Zhao noted.\n\nThe true entity behind the Ronin Bridge breach was the North Korean hacker outfit, Lazarus, according to a recent article by Kripteu Magazine. The US Treasury Department and the FBI worked together to follow the cash as they were moved from Tornado Cash.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the FBI believes these breaches are a source of cash for Kim Jong UN's North Korean regime. Besides that, many new initiatives focusing on environmental well-being, such as SET and Plastik, were hoping to list on these platforms but they may have had trouble generating good replies. Meanwhile, Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, is working to retrieve the taken assets.\n\nThe North Korean hacker outfit Lazarus was revealed to be the true preparator of the Ronin Bridge breach in a previous article by Cryptonary. It's also worth noting that the FBI believes such breaches are a source of cash for North Korea's Kim Jong Un-led government.",

In essence, ABNBC =  BNB + staking income wrapped into a token, damn good no ?\n\nStill, farming in Pancakeswap means you\u2019ll receive the rewards in CAKE, you\u2019d probably want to convert that to BNB. Using our yield optimizer at [happyhippo.farm](https://happyhippo.farm),  where you can find an autocompounding vault for ABNBC-BNB, means you\u2019ll get 110% APY for staking BNB and will receive rewards in BNB as well, not some meaningless reward token. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/km2iy24jwav81.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=257816a03f2785794ff89c13cf83af2318647c44\n\nWith ABNBC trading at \\~1.02 BNB, the LP is basically  a stable no impermanent loss blue-chip token pairing with triple digit yields, unmatched anywhere else. There\u2019s no sure thing in life yet ABNBC-BNB is probably the closest thing to that right now.",

Binance's head of Eastern Europe and Russia, Gleb Kostarev did consent to this. \n\n\"Binance told Reuters it had never been contacted by Russian authorities regarding Navalny. It said that before the war it was \"actively seeking compliance in Russia,\" which would have required it to respond to \"appropriate requests from regulators and law enforcement agencies.\"\n\nSo this is a 2021 issue not a 2022 issue now happening because of the russian vs ukraine issues.",

The Terra ecosystem, which is currently among the most valued top ten cryptocurrency projects in the market, has closed a year of development by becoming the largest decentralized stablecoin.\n\n\nUST, one of the stablecoins produced from the Terra project, has overtaken DAI, another decentralized stablecoin, as the most valued project of its kind by market valuation. This concludes a year of progress for the Terra ecosystem and UST, which saw its market value rise from $182 million at the start of 2021 to $9 billion in December.\n\n\nEven though these function by putting up collateral to support the tokens on the market, UST is an algorithmic stablecoin that leverages another Terra ecosystem token (LUNA) to balance its peg against the US dollar value.\n\n\nOther decentralized stable coins' market capitalization has increased in the previous 30 days. These decentralized coins don't require a centralized point of issue and can't be halted by a central authority. UST is now the fourth most valuable stablecoin, trailing only USDT, USDC, and BUSD, which are all centralized stablecoins.\n\n\nBecause of the increased attention that stablecoins like USDT and USDC are receiving from authorities, some feel that these alternative stablecoins will continue to grow in popularity, with people flocking to these alternatives for various reasons. Despite this, USDT remains the most popular stablecoin on exchanges, with over $68 billion worth of the currency changing hands yesterday.\n\n\nThe price of UST has risen to ATH levels, as has the price of LUNA, its sibling token. Many projects like Deedy can benefit from this in their digital transformation consulting can aid you to acquire productivity gains, effectiveness, and consciousness.",

Elrond tokens are defined by the Elrond Standard Digital Token (ESDT), which is the industry standard. The commencement of the new relationship will be marked by the introduction of Utrust's UTK coins on Binance.\n\nBinance has covered almost every aspect of DeFi finance and liquidity management. The platform has recently began to grow, and DeFi and TradFi entrepreneurs are being aggressively incorporated. As part of its objective to open up new areas in DeFi, the exchange executed an integration contract with Elrond to distribute the ESDT tokens. \n\nThe first token to take advantage of this opportunity is Utrust, an Elrond-based payment processor. The web3 startup, which began as an Ethereum ERC20 coin, has only lately migrated to the Elrond network. The move was prompted by high gas fees and slow blockchain transactions. After becoming an ESDT token, Utrust's UTK can now be deposited and withdrawn directly on Elrond.\n\nThe key benefit of this integration is that it reduces transaction costs and speeds up UTK transactions. Given 9f Elrond\u2019s advanced technology and infrastructure, it will be a realistic target for UTK. The payments company has published the UTK 2.0 economies upgrade, which will improve the UTK tokens\u2019 use.\nThis is intended to revolutionize the entire view of web3 payments and bring this industry to a wider variety of merchants due to the quickness and incentives. Elrond and Binance\u2019s integration comes at a good time for UTK, and it\u2019s expected to offer these visions a boost.\nAccording to Elrond, Binance will help sell the blockchain\u2019s native products to a wider audience. Elrond CEO Beniamin Mincu, noted that the startups on Elrond will have access to the largest marketplaces and deepest liquidity imaginable through Binance.\nIn a similar vein, Sanja Kon, CEO of Utrust, believes it will spur the development of their Merchant Yield product and play a vital part in the mainstreaming of web3 payments. Consequently, this integration will greatly improve the project\u2019s scalability.",

            "selftext": "The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed claims brought by U.S. residents trading on the Binance digital exchange on March 31, 2022, ruling that the plaintiffs' purchases of digital tokens were extraterritorial transactions that were not subject to federal or state securities laws in the United States. [1] This decision provides a lot more clarity for digital asset providers who are trying to figure out what the criteria are for claiming jurisdiction in the United States. It also lends credence to the idea that offshore corporations can gain access to US-based computer infrastructure without being subject to US jurisdiction. \n\nBecause Binance is a decentralized platform, the biggest of it's kind and home to several crypto like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Quint; the location of its principal place of business for jurisdictional purposes was a major point of contention in the case. Binance's location in Malta was only mentioned by the court.\n\nThe plaintiffs, all of whom are residents of the United States, began buying digital tokens on Binance in 2017. The tokens were first offered to investors in an initial coin offering (ICO) and then placed on Binance for secondary trading. Binance was paid a commission on each trade by the issuers in exchange for listing their tokens. \n\nInvestors were not informed that the tokens they were acquiring on Binance constituted securities under US law, according to the plaintiffs. Investors claimed they only learned of the tokens' status as securities on April 3, 2019, when the SEC's Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology released a report outlining a number of factors to consider when determining whether a digital token is a \"investment contract\" and thus a security under federal securities laws.\n\nThe federal district court approved Binance's move for summary judgment on two grounds: the plaintiffs' purchases were not domestic transactions subject to U.S. federal and state securities laws, and their claims were time-barred because they began proceedings too late. \n\nPlaintiffs' arguments focused on whether purchases made on the Binance platform were sufficiently linked to the US to be subject to US securities regulations. The United States Supreme Court ruled in Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. that federal securities rules apply to \"transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges, as well as domestic transactions in other securities.\" \n\nAn exchange is considered \"domestic\" under Morrison if it is required to register as a \"national securities exchange.\" [5] If a \"facility of [the] exchange [is] within or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" registration is necessary. [6] Plaintiffs claimed that Binance is hosted on Amazon Web Services servers in the United States, and that Ethereum blockchain computers in the United States support some Binance transactions. The court determined that using third-party servers located at the third party's discretion was insufficient to classify Binance as a national securities exchange, citing a previous decision holding that transactions routed through computer servers in New York did not render RICO claims domestic in nature. [7] The plaintiffs were also unable to cite any precedent to support their allegation that Binance's other purported U.S. contacts\u2014the use of English on the Binance website, several workers in California, and job advertising in the United States\u2014are sufficient to form a domestic exchange.",

They're now asking me to complete a deposit wire transfer so they can confirm my account and receive my funds, but I don't have enough in this account to do said wire transfer because they didn't send me my funds. A vicious cycle of me not seeing MY money. The support has been ok with responding, but I really don't see how this fuckery works and am beyond frustrated. I can transfer money into my account to do this wire transfer but at this point I have no faith I'm not just throwing away another $600 dollars for nothing. Any help would be appreciated, I just really can't believe this absolute fuckery of me not getting my money. I didn't get a notification or anything, if I hadn't reached out it would've just disappeared apparently.",

One comment explains 2 methods scammers use it for, another method they use is to swap these coins to other real currencies you need to use very specific dexes or shady exchanges. They make you sign these \"\"\"\"\"UNLIMITED\"\"\"\"\"\" spend contracts essentially giving them full access to that specific coin in that specific contract. Remember all trusted sites like opensea and many more websites ask you to sign unlimited spend contracts but since they are trusted no one complains and these companies don't spend our cryptos. However when you use shady Dexs, or scam websites they make you sign such contracts and they drain your wallets. So to be careful and to check the total risk exposure of your wallet, you can use debank to check how much risk exposure you have. Remember debank has now shifted from their website to rabby wallet, so connect to rabby only if you're using a ledger or hardware wallet, otherwise to connect wallet you need to type in your seed phrase and proceed with caution, they are not scammers but still you're unnecessarily connecting seed phrase to too many wallets when you're trying to keep that information very confidential.",

            "selftext": "Hi Binance and Binance Angel, \n\nI wanted to check with you all to see if my situation was eligible for the [BNB Pioneer Burn Program](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/7bcf4da5671d44a0a5118c2277773bb4).\n\nOver two weeks ago I accidentally withdrew BEP-20 USDT from FTX Exchange to the wrong Binance deposit address (see [transaction](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x5d23acd50ccd87b4008cc7365fc6e00d2be629459cb213e53a5061ee7cb318c8)). My intention was to withdraw the BEP-20 USDT from FTX to my Binance account via BNB Chain but miscopied the Binance deposit address and pasted it with a previously copied [contract address](https://debank.com/profile/0xb2EC38aE446458592d2ed030cA34141Ce2943E77). Both the addresses ended in '7' so I thought it was my Binance BEP-20 deposit address when I was going through the process. I only realized it was the incorrect address after the confirmation had completed awhile ago and deposit was not credited.\n\nThe contract address is clearly an Ethereum contract address: [https://etherscan.io/address/0xb2ec38ae446458592d2ed030ca34141ce2943e77](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb2ec38ae446458592d2ed030ca34141ce2943e77) and therefore it cannot be accessed because the private key to the address is not accessible to anyone ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70394350/how-can-i-get-the-private-key-of-the-address-of-the-underlying-contract-through)). Therefore this contract address cannot be accessed on BNB Chain, as the BNB and ETH address share the same private key.\n\nI have asked Binance customer service about this and they said it was not eligible for the BNB Pioneer Burn Program because Binance cannot access the contract address. I thought that was the point of this burn program because the funds are lost forever in contract addresses. Would you deem this situation eligible for the BNB Pioneer Burn Program?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kibooxttowu81.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=591083e87519b5766e100b96369241974c131b66",

            "selftext": "Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, has recently been on a rampage, forming many partnerships and obtaining licenses in various countries. According to a new Forbes story, the cryptocurrency exchange has formed a joint partnership with Gulf Energy Development. Businessman Sarath Ratanavadi actually owns Gulf Energy Development.\n\n\nBinance wants to extend its services into Thailand. An agreement with Sarath Ratanavadi's Gulf Energy Development will help the exchange receive a license from Thai regulators. On the other contrary, this cooperation was first revealed in February by Reuters, citing words from a top executive.\n\nAccording to the senior executive, the relationship will be publicly announced in the second half of 2022. Forbes has verified the collaboration as Q2 begins.\n\nFurthermore, according to Forbes, Gulf Energy Development plans to invest in BNB, which is also known as the Binance Coin. They will also invest in part of the shares of Binance, the US branch of the cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n \nAccording to Brian Shroder, the current CEO of the exchanges, the US is aiming for an IPO.\n\n \nGulf Energy filed an official statement with the Thai Stock Exchange on Monday, wherein the company stated:\n\n \n\n\"The company, Gulf Energy believes that this multi-level collaboration with Binance, the world leader in blockchain service platform, is in line with the company's goal of becoming the pioneer in the field infrastructure. Will also offer prospects for the firm to widen into other digital asset-based initiatives in the long term.\"\n\n \n\nFurthermore, it's worth noting that Binance received many warnings in 2021 from the Thai administration. Thai governments declared that the company had no authority to trade in the country without a license. On the alternative side, Thailand has outlawed the use of cryptocurrency for payments and the trade of Non Fungible Tokens and meme currencies. \n\n\nFurthermore, companies like deedy, and other digital transformation oriented projects are also working strategically at the moment to overcome similar hurdles which can result in a positive manner for the company.",

            "selftext": "In Q1 2022, the Binance Chain, one of the world's most extensively utilized blockchains, burned 1,839,786.261 BNB, the Blockchain's native cryptocurrency, valued around $742 million. This is the 19th installment in Binance Chain's quarterly token burn program, which started in the third quarter of 2017. \n\nSince the debut of the Binance Chain and its native token, BNB, in 2017, the team has pledged to burn a total of 100 million BNB, or half of the total supply, to remove them from circulation. The Auto-Burn formula was used to automatically calculate the number of tokens removed for this quarter.\n\nBinance launched and implemented its first-ever auto-burn program, the BEP-95, in the fourth quarter of 2021, which calculates the number of BNB tokens to be burned using a formula based on the total number of blocks produced on the Binance Chain and BNB's average dollar-denominated price during the quarter.\n\nWhen cryptocurrency tokens or coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum or Nature Vault are purposefully and permanently removed from circulation, they are referred to as \"burned.\" The development team behind a cryptocurrency asset is usually in charge of token burning. It can be done in a number of methods, the most frequent of which is to send the coins to a so-called \"eater address,\" which has its current balance publicly viewable on the blockchain but no access to its contents. \n\nBurning may entail the project's developers purchasing tokens from the market or burning a portion of the supply currently accessible to them. Burning can be done with different goals in mind, but most often it is used for deflationary purposes: \n\nthe decrease in the circulating supply tends to drive an asset\u2019s price upward, incentivizing traders and investors to get involved. Another important use case for token burning is to maintain the price peg of stablecoins (cryptocurrencies whose value corresponds to another asset, like the U.S. dollar).",

I use the lite version and I'm not in the US if that helps. The only 2 coins I have are ADA and VET, in case that has any relevance.\n\nYou all feel free to tell me what you see but I gave up on CS, they just called me a liar and contradicted each other until I got tired and took my coins out.

            "selftext": "Binance (BNB), a top-tier crypto asset, lost 0.50 percent today compared to yesterday, although the rate remained stable at $414.59 (BNB/USD). The BNB price reached a high of $426.81 on Wednesday, and it has since declined slightly. Binance, like the rest of the market, was bullish at the end of last month, but that isn't the case right now.\n\nToday, the cryptocurrency market is mostly flat, with Bitcoin (BTC) down 0.66 percent, Ethereum down 0.03 percent, and Solana down 2.04 percent.  Crypto markets like Binance, Tycoon and Coinbase are feeling the effect of this. BNB is right on level with the other major players, and it is clinging to its fourth-place position with vigor. We don't expect it to move much farther from there, but we do expect it to follow the rest of the market. Binance will likely lag behind Bitcoin as it moves, so keep an eye on that main cryptocurrency for clues about what BNB might do.\n\nBecause the big crypto market players have shown no movement, it's possible that we're about to see a shift in one direction or the other. Currently, the war in Ukraine continues, affecting much of Europe and the rest of the world. Inflation is on the rise (4.38 percent as of the last check), and bitcoin is being scrutinized as a number of governments consider tightening regulations. None of this bodes good for BNB's or the crypto market's long-term prospects, but we could see some short-term gains anyway. \n\nMany of the variables that have kept rates where they are (which is worse than last year) are unlikely to change anytime soon. Cryptocurrency may not be a good investment at this time.\n\nBNB may rise during the next week or so, but it may struggle to hang on to any gains. On April 5th, BNB reached a new high of $457.67. This might happen again, and the $450 barrier level is where most investors are keeping an eye on this cryptocurrency. \n\nBNB has no issue sliding below $400 from time to time in recent weeks, thus the support level is around $380. BNB has dipped below $380 a few times this year, and it is possible that it will do so again if there is a bearish market shift.",

The biggest cryptocurrency exchange over tycoon and Coinbase.\n\nPoyraz is currently the Director of Sanctions Compliance at Binance, having joined the company in January 2022. \n\nPoyraz's current responsibilities include ensuring that Binance fulfills and maintains complete sanctions compliance globally, as well as developing sanctions control frameworks comparable to those used by traditional banks, according to a news statement from Binance.\n\n\"It takes a coordinated effort to ensure global security. I've been developing collaborative initiatives that can effectively handle complex sanctions regimes for more than a decade. \"Digital assets have tremendous promise, and their use necessitates collaboration to ensure resiliency against both old and new threats,\" Poyraz added. \n\nPoyraz has over 17 years of experience in risk management, compliance, strategy, and intergovernmental relations. Designing sophisticated tools and programs to prevent, identify, and report sanctions evasion and money laundering schemes, particularly in the traditional financial sector, is part of this.\n\nPoyraz previously led the AML and Sanctions initiatives at Coupang, South Korea's largest online marketplace. He also designed the company's financial crime compliance program and the essential risk controls for its NASDAQ listing (NYSE). \n\nPoyraz was the risk steward for sanctions at HSBC, where he was responsible for maintaining the bank's sanctions program, adhering to and following sanctions imposed by the UN, European Union, United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. His responsibilities included engaging with regulators, conducting enterprise-wide risk assessments, and overseeing the completion of a deferred prosecution agreement. \n\nPoyraz belongs to the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists as well as the Association of Certified Sanctions Specialists. He graduated from Vancouver Island University with a B.A. in Global Studies.",

On Wednesday, she is scheduled to speak for Binance at the Paris Blockchain Week Summit on the topic of \"leveraging blockchain to combat crime.\" Cabossioras is now a Binance employee, according to a Binance staffer at the exchange's conference stand.\n\nBinance was contacted for comment by The Block, but no response was received by press time. \n\nAs the industry strives to connect with financial authorities, the appointment is the latest example of a crypto exchange snatching expertise from a regulator. Binance just appointed Steven McWhirter, a UK Financial Conduct Authority officer, as its global director of regulatory policy. \n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao announced a 100 million euro ($108 million) investment in France earlier in the day, stating the country is \"uniquely positioned to be the leader of this industry in Europe.\"",

            "selftext": "P2P, or peer-to-peer, trading has long been a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency environment in crypto marketplaces be it Tycoon, Coinbase or Binance. P2P transactions, similar to the pre-fiat currency barter system, allow traders to directly exchange crypto with one another without the use of a third party or middleman. \nBecause of some of its features for both casual and professional users, such as the ability to chat with one's trading counterparty before completing a transaction, or the possibility of traders personalizing their offerings based on their preferred price, payment methods, and local currency, P2P trading has grown in popularity and adoption. It also has perks like no trade fees and a variety of payment options.\n\nWhile P2P trading is handy, trading with other users might be problematic if there is no third party to handle the transaction on their behalf. In order to protect one's cash, P2P trading should be done on safe and secure platforms like Binance P2P. This will help to avoid cases of fraud or theft by unscrupulous players.\n\nWith recent advancements in P2P markets, crypto exchanges such as Binance have been working hard to improve the P2P experience by adding and enhancing tactics to assure the convenience and security of trading on their platform. P2P escrow is one of these solutions, which ensures that both buyers and sellers are protected from fraud or theft. \n\nThe escrow accomplishes this in two ways: it assists buyers in filing an appeal if the counterparty fails to release the cryptocurrency after payment; and it protects sellers by holding the cryptocurrency in a temporary deposit within the escrow service until the counterparty's payment has been verified. If the payment is not verified within a certain amount of time, the bitcoin is returned to the seller.\n\nBecause of the significant expansion of its customers, Binance took additional steps in the first half of 2021 to double its efforts in guaranteeing a secure and optimal trading environment. Initially, P2P trading on the Binance exchange was only available to verified merchants, but in order to ensure inclusivity and fulfill its promise to provide trading freedom to all of its users, Binance opened up the platform to all users, but with strict rules and guidelines in place to protect and prevent people from losing their funds. Recently, the platform has been expanded and fresh features and regulations have been incorporated to further enhance user protection. Here are just a handful of the many notable steps Binance has taken to make the world a safer place for everyone: \n\nUsers will be required to complete stringent identity verification stages such as indicating the quantity of completed P2P orders, SMS authentication processes, and the number of unique trading counterparties if new trading criteria are added. Fraudulent and untrustworthy offerings or advertisements might be avoided in this way. \n\n\nOrder-Matching Upgrade: Order-matching is a procedure in which exchanges like Binance link one or more unsolicited buy orders with one or more sell orders to make trades, according to Investopedia. The Binance team can ensure that its users may trade with reliable traders and certified merchants by enhancing the matching algorithm.\n\nRisk Management Algorithm Optimization: By improving its risk management algorithms, Binance has been able to better monitor suspicious activity on its P2P network, reducing the trading activities of possible criminal actors. \nUser Education Initiatives: Cryptocurrency companies must provide a safe and secure environment for their consumers, but users must also play a role in protecting their money. Binance has responded by providing consumers with access to an extensive resource on peer-to-peer best practices, hosting P2P webinars throughout the world, and providing security guidelines for trading on its platform.\n\nUsers can be protected from potential theft and encouraged to trade prudently if they have access to this information.\n\nWhile there is no risk-free investment strategy, Binance's initiatives to protect the safety of users in its marketplace allow investors and P2P traders to trade more freely. These actions are a clear indication of the brand's mission to protect its users' assets and provide excellent service while also promoting crypto innovation and growth.",

I purchased some BNB yesterday to meet the unit sale price and noticed that some kind of average is being calculated, so now I only have part of what I spent held so far. My problem is that this is only a fraction of what I need to purchase a ticket. Even though it says I am \"qualified for participation\" since I meet the minimum holding requirement\u2013 will I still be able to actually purchase a ticket? I have the impression that this means I have insufficient funds and must wait out a couple of days for the averages to calculate the whole sum. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo ultimately, what I want to know is if I can purchase a ticket if my BNB holding (in x amount of days) does not match the unit sale price by the time subscription starts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

I am not a pattern trader and I don't trade the 15min chart but if you believe that this is a bull flag and you want to take a long position based on it then you can not expect this single signal to play out for hours. Again I don't trade based on patterns and neither do I trade break outs but if I would then my long would have looked like this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/YLFHzHt1/ \ntarget the high of day and take profits quick. The market environment is extremely bearish at the moment so I only try to sell pumps at the moment but if you want to take long trades then make sure to manage your risk. Also there is so much more to look at then just single patterns like that, find some confluence before you make a decision.",

It was operating without a license in several jurisdictions, according to some. Others warned against using the company's services.\n\nBinance has stated that it welcomes regulation and collaborates with governments throughout the world and is therefore enhancing its reputation as the best crypto platform out there over others like Coinbase and Tycoon. \n\nOn Wednesday, Zhao stated that French President Emmanuel Macron's government was open to the mostly unregulated cryptocurrency business. \n\n\"France has some really pro-business, pro-crypto policies, and (the) government's attitude toward this industry... has been wonderful,\" he told a crowded conference held in the historic edifice of the Paris stock exchange. \n\nAccording to a chart showed during Zhao's lecture, Binance is already the most popular cryptocurrency exchange in France.\n\nLast month, the exchange announced that it had been granted permission to perform limited operations in Dubai, from where it intends to conduct regional business.

Trade with him, make sure when your girlfriend received the payment then you release the USDT for him.\nDONE",

With the expansion of cryptocurrency exchanges in the Middle East, and the region showing an increased interest in the NFT space, the ecosystem is poised to see exponential growth. Fundamentally sound projects linked to the NFT space like Quint, Mana, Enjin, and Axie Infinity will likely enjoy Middle Eastern investors' interest.\n\nAccording to a statement by Binance's Head of MENA, Richard Teng:\n\"Binance has been actively engaging global regulators, such as ADGM, as part of its ongoing commitment to uphold global standards and collectively foster the developments and sustainable growth of the crypto ecosystem.\"\n\nHe further mentioned that Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, is contemplating making Dubai his \"base for the foreseeable future.\"",

Binance is therefore leading the way for other crypto exchange platforms like Tycoon and Coinbase. \n\nBinance, the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange, will launch a \"charity crypto card\" this month for those forced to flee Ukraine and in need of assistance, Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov announced on Telegram after speaking with the company's CEO Changpeng Zhao.\n\n\"This is an important support for our citizens during the war,\" a government official said, according to the cryptocurrency news outlet Forklog. He stated that the exchange is still working with his department on cryptocurrency adoption and that it plans to support educational projects in the digital space to help more Ukrainians gain digital skills and new professional qualifications. \n\nFedorov, who is also the deputy prime minister of Ukraine, stated that the company has already committed $10 million to Ukraine and plans to increase the amount to $20 million in the near future. Binance Charity collects cryptocurrency donations to support the humanitarian efforts of major intergovernmental and local non-governmental organizations.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian cryptocurrency exchange Whitebit has signed a cooperation agreement with the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The company recently stated that it can assist people who have fled Ukraine in escaping the ongoing hostilities through its foreign representative offices and technical and other resources. According to a recently published blog post:\n\nWhitebit plans to help Ukraine's Consular Service in the countries where it has offices, as well as to facilitate \"the transition of foreign diplomatic institutions to barrier-free digital spaces.\" It also promised to support the Foreign Ministry's Anti-Crisis Center and a call center that provides consultations to Ukrainians in need.",

Might try with spot grid trading, more on that at the end of the post.\n\nAnd so, I thought I should ignore that for now, and focus more on the \"invest\" type functionality offered by binance. Stuff like liquid swap, dual investment, etc... Basically the Earn functionality.\n\nBut seeing as I still have a smallish amount to play with, I feel it would be more profitable to put all of it into one such method of investment, rather than split it up into all or most (at least for now).\n\nWhat method would you recommend is best for increasing the amount of crypto say in BTC you own (value is not as important for the moment)? \n\nAbout spot grid trading: best resources to learn how/when to use it? Is it just automated buying/selling, and so no different to regular trading for someone who doesnt have the knowledge and experience of reading markets?\n\nSorry for the long post, and thank you in advance if you took the time to read it all and reply!",

There\u2019s nothing better than experience to learn. I\u2019m not saying you should trade blindly, though. Lots of traders on either articles, servers and youtube share their experience in the trading world, so check them out if you can.\r  \n\r  \nThe Earn system is pretty straightforward. You either hodl your cryptos, stake them or invest in them. If you\u2019re looking for cryptos with high APYs, then I\u2019d advise you to keep an eye on new projects. Their volatility makes buying them too risky, so developers present an excessively high amount of APY to compensate. Stable coins are also a viable option, however.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I feel like I want to earn quick bucks, I usually visit [BSC Coins](https://bsc-coins.com/) to see what new coins have just been registered in the BSC network, then I do my research and hodl them using the Earn system if they show enough promise.",

However the fee to withdraw SOL is 0.01 SOL (approx $1).\n\nSo it nah be cheapest to convert BTC to Sol, send it to another exchange like Coinbase Pro and then convert and withdraw to a wallet that way. \n\nDoes anyone have a cheaper way around?\n\nAlso interested if someone knows a similar way for funds on Crypto.com (although I appreciate this is the wrong sub-Reddit).

            "selftext": "According to Forbes' 2022 Billionaires rankings, published on Tuesday April 5, Changpeng Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance, is the wealthiest person in crypto, worth an estimated $65 billion. \n\nThat places \"CZ,\" as he is known, as the world's 19th richest person, ahead of well-known American billionaires such as computer entrepreneur Michael Dell and oil tycoon Charles Koch, at the age of 44. \n\nForbes estimates Binance's market worth to be $92.5 billion (based on March 11 market pricing) and Zhao's ownership position to be at least 70% after speaking with crypto industry analysts and individuals familiar with the company.\n\nBinance, which is privately held, does not provide financial or ownership information. Binance is a cryptocurrency exchange based in the Cayman Islands that operates in over 180 countries through a network of connected businesses, a strategy that has prompted regulatory scrutiny. In the last year, regulators in Japan, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong have all issued warnings against the corporation for operating without their license. Bloomberg reported in May 2021 that the United States Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service were investigating Binance for money laundering and tax evasion. Binance said it takes its legal and compliance responsibilities seriously, but declined to respond to specific questions. \n\nBinance has a unique business model that involves issuing its own tokens, known as Binance coin (BNB), to clients and utilizing them as an incentive for trading and recruiting new customers, among the hundreds of crypto exchanges that exist internationally [See Forbes' Global Crypto Exchanges Ranking]. The more BNB coins you own and the more people you bring to the trading platform, the more commissions and discounts you earn in this multi-level marketing scheme. Initially, BNB was primarily used for discount trading, but it has since evolved into a full-fledged cryptocurrency with a variety of payment options on platforms such as competing exchanges like Tycoon.io and Crypto.com.\n\nBinance also does what's known in the crypto space as \"burning,\" or retiring tokens on a regular basis to keep track of the total number of tokens in circulation. Binance ceased burning its native token BNB at a proportionate to profit rate in January 2020, instead choosing for a burn rate connected to trade volume, hiding the public's perception of how much money Binance was making. BNB token has a market valuation of $73 billion, according to CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency pricing website owned by Binance. Because CZ's ownership of BNB coins is unclear, Forbes' net worth assessment excludes it. \n\nCoinbase's successful first public offering (IPO) and $42 billion market capitalization (as of March 11, 2022, when Forbes took a global snapshot of billionaires)\n\nCZ previously skirted about his ownership interest in Binance, telling Forbes in January 2021 that he controlled roughly 30% \u2014possibly: \"I don't actually know what my net worth is.\" In the summer, he added, \"I'm not too troubled about it.\" CZ's ownership in Binance, according to persons familiar with the subject who spoke to Forbes on the condition of anonymity, is significantly higher\u2013at least 70%. (Binance subsidiaries registered in the United Kingdom and Malta suggest CZ controls majority holdings in those companies, while the extent of those businesses inside Binance's bigger Cayman Islands holding company is impossible to determine.) \n\nZhao, like many other crypto millionaires, is a self-made billionaire. In 1977, he was born in Jiangsu, China. His father, a professor, was soon called a \"pro-bourgeois genius\" and deported temporarily. The family relocated to Vancouver, Canada, in the late 1980s.\n\n CZ helped cover household costs as a teenager by flipping burgers at McDonald's and worked nighttime jobs at a petrol station. He began coding at the age of 16 and went on to acquire a computer science degree at McGill University in Montreal.",

Not from Venus!](https://preview.redd.it/ya8wcdx71hs81.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=db49481b95a963a42f58890dc5ce1936455f7c4c)\n\nSince 7% missing interest over 2 months, especially in Bitcoin -- kind of is a huge Risk, i wondered..:\n\n\\- where does Binance get the interest from?- why do they tell us its on Venus, when its clearly not on Venus? Venus is unable to return 8% Interest, does not offer locked investments..- if its not on venus and the interest is generated by binance somehow different - why do they lie about it to us, putting these savings products in a own category \"DeFi Savings\" and having you nod the higher risks?!\n\n8.19% on Bitcoin is ... extremely high to be honest.\n\nI am getting very suspicious at Binance regarding all these DeFi-Frontrunning Products. I don't feel like this is any honest at all; there is no transparencfy and i have the feel Binance is pushing people to actively lock-in funds with high APYs just do lower them significantly, as soon as enough people have done so.\n\ne.g. i once locked a lot of BNB for 120 Days and 12% just to find it drop to 6% in the next weeks - being unable to get any of my locked stakings out.\n\nDoes anybody have similiar experiences? E.g. all those shitcoins dropped by BNB-Vault - they proactively offer high locked-staking APYs to hinder you from just selling it? You should still do so: none of the coins Binance released in the last 2 years made anyone except Binance and the Founders any Money.\n\nNeed examples?\n\nMC  \nTLM  \nLTO  \nLIT  \nQI  \nALICE  \nRIF  \nREEF  \n\n\n... all these distributed Vault-Coins have been at their ATHs straight after release, and drop continously every since.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBinance is abusing its huge marketingpower to shill shitcoins to its millions of users, triggers greed with high APYs (who never raise after you staked but only decline :))) and bullshits everyone into savings products as e.g. 40% for CAKE when you get 64% on [pancakeswap.io](https://pancakeswap.io) directly. (Obviously binance takes 50% of your Interest here just for delegating/frontrunning).\n\nBinance is for noobs who like shitcoins - stay away from 95% of their coins. They are all shit. Nothing substantial ever comes from the Launchpad.\n\nin 2022 Binance Launchpad/Listing have become the exact opposite of what thesy used to be in e.g. 2018/19:\n\nBack then it was a BULLISH SIGNAL if a coin was listed/founded by Binance.  \nIn 2022 its a BEARISH SIGNAL if a coin is dispersed by Binance or founded by it.",

Just so the app doesn't crash in the first few minutes of the launch we're going to restrict the number of closed beta testers to about 50 or so.\n\nOnce we're confident it runs fine (and will have inevitably fixed the bugs that'll come out of the closed beta) we'll do an Open Beta followed by a full release.\n\nJoin us at [r/aesirofficial](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/aesirofficial/) for more updates or simply apply for closed beta access here: [https://aesircrypto.com/signup.html](https://aesircrypto.com/signup.html)",

Interest Protocol will farm the loans\u00b4 collateral on PanckaSwap MasterChef and Venus. Investors will be able to use exotic assets such as LP tokens as collateral to borrow DNR while farming them on PCS, which decreases their loan cost. In the case of single assets such as Bitcoin and BNB investors, collateral will be farmed in Venus. In addition, we control the interest rate of DNR loans, which allows us to manipulate the cost of the loan to benefit the borrowers.\n\nOur test net only has BTC as collateral but expects us to add other assets in the main net, including interest-bearing tokens and liquidity provider tokens. The users have to use the BSC test net through their Metamask wallets and click on the faucet in our Dapp to mint a test BTC to get a DNR loan.\n\n* **Test net link:**\n\n[https://www.interestprotocol.com/dapp](https://www.interestprotocol.com/dapp)\n\n**Dinero Market test net**\n\nPlease read our medium article to learn how to use it: [https://medium.com/@interestprotocol/dinero-market-test-net-6bf3e234ddb8](https://medium.com/@interestprotocol/dinero-market-test-net-6bf3e234ddb8)\n\nFeedback form: [https://forms.gle/aDP4wHvshLPKkKv97](https://forms.gle/aDP4wHvshLPKkKv97)\n\n**For more information, check out the following links:**\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.com/invite/PJEkqM4Crk](https://discord.com/invite/PJEkqM4Crk)\n\nTG: [https://t.me/interestprotocol](https://t.me/interestprotocol)",

Demand and Construction will increase, likewise prosperity.\n\nPrice rises for Oil, Energy, and Commodities will cause inexorable inflationary pressure and inflation will be in excess of 5% in the short to medium term across dependent countries. In the long term the dislocation within, and regression from globalization will result in, almost immutable, inflationary pressures globally, especially in dependent countries.\n\n**And, oh, add decreases in Efficiency.**\n\nThe power, spheres of influence, and economy of China will needlessly fall due to its support of Russia, irrespective of its understandable anti-American perspective. Nevertheless, its stance will come at a net cost to Great China. Thus, possibly throwing away its golden chance to usurp or replace the USA in some respects in world affairs.\n\n**The world needs a prosperous and Great China.**\n\nPutin has atrociously ostracized Russia for at least two more generations after this, with his evil-laden and senseless war. The gross miscalculation of Putin and the Russian Army in invading a peaceful, progressive Ukraine and friendly Ukrainian people is a game-changer in world affairs, world trade, and will cause a realignment in various economies, increase inflation and provide fodder and a massive accelerator for the adoption and growth of cryptocurrencies worldwide.\n\nChina can't save Russia, neither its brain drain nor corporate exodus. It has instead helped to solidify the dominant position of the USD and by extension spur the growth and entrenchment of the world\u2019s sole superpower, the USA.\n\n**Why?**\n\nIt\u2019s now practically impossible to replace the USD in global trade or in Russia\u2019s trade with the world or the USD as the world\u2019s prime reference currency.\n\nThe USD is in widespread use worldwide and it\u2019s backed by a democratic government system, the largest and most liquid bond market, furthermore by higher hydrocarbons production, and by the world\u2019s largest economy with an unparalleled innovation culture, and equity markets, and venture capital sector.\n\n**Still, looking for further proof?**\n\n[The Executive Order on Digital Assets by President Biden on 9.3.22](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/) will accelerate the innovative streak of God\u2019s own country, the USA.\n\nCryptocurrency's prospects have never looked or been this good. Viewed from all perspectives including governmental, inflationary pressures, and huge public awareness, institutional adoption, and HODL; cryptocurrencies will invariably and inexorably rise in value, become pervasive, and a powerful driver for creating prosperous peoples across the world.\n\n**Global poverty will be lower.**\n\nAll told, earthly factors and the gods favor cryptocurrencies and related sectors. I foresee stupendous growth in the total market cap of cryptocurrencies in excess of $150T, powered by endemic adoption worldwide and the proliferation of cryptocurrencies.\n\n[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy Mr. Michael[Ultainfinity Global Group](http://ultainfinity.com/)Founder, Chairman & Group CEO",

I contacted support, sent the appeal according to instructions, but they sent false appeal result, from totally different person(with his personal information). Support isn\u2019t even described the problem, they only mentioned that there are several issues with payment channel and they are working on it. Also they said there isn\u2019t particular time, when it will be solved. This is unbelievable. They also agreed that they are responsible for my problem. I am strongly disappointed by this. Please upvote this, I need solved this problem.

People like \"thats why im leaving binance\" what do you think? You move to cex #4 which will be in the same situation, only few months later, because its significantly smaller, thus not getting so much attention. Binance beign biggest cex in the world takes the government hammering as first one ofc. Its not like binance denies you futures by their own will, theyre losing a ton of fee money because of that.",

            "selftext": "Today has been one of the worst days in my blockchain and crypto journey with the company I trusted all my funds.\n\nOn March 31, 2022  @binance introduced a truly misleading referral campaign called \"Binance Lite Referral Mode\"\n\nThis @binance campaign claims it will give a \"100 USDT Cashback Voucher\" for both you and the person you introduce if they deposit $50 USD worth or more to their platform. Their website literally says:\n\n\"Refer Friends. Earn Crypto Together.\"\n\nAfter seeing this naturally I introduced this @binance promotion to my friends, family members and work associates, many of them new to crypto but encouraged by the idea they would receive a 100 USDT Cashback Voucher they went ahead and invested $50 USD worth or more on @binance platform\n\nSo why is this misleading you might think? Well because after 48 hours when @binance send us this \"100 USDT Cashback Voucher\" we realized this balance its only good for the trading fees you generate in your spot trading and also only valid for 14 days\n\nHow could an user who was just introduced to @binance and maybe to the whole crypto spectre take advantage of this \"100 USDT Cashback Voucher\".\n\nThey would need to spend on average 10K USD worth of trading to spend the whole voucher in less than 14 days!! (Trading fees are less than 1 cent in most of the trades)\n\nDo you think @binance isn't aware of this? That a crypto newbie won't do spend 10K worth of trading at least not in their first 14 days? \n\nBut guess what? They still decided launch this misleading promotion and get liquidity from new users.\n\nSome of you might say you should have read the terms. But you will need to dig really deep into @binance website to see the voucher its only good for trading fees.\n\nWhen you go to the Promotion it doesn't say anything about it only being good for fees, not even under the Rules or FAQ of the promotion.\n \nYou need to go to a section called \"Cashback Voucher Term and Conditions\" to notice it says it is only good for fees.\n\nAt this point I feel so ashamed and embarrased with all the people I got to Sign Up, give all their personal information and invest $50 on @binance platform. I might need to at least buy that balance from them to cope with myself. This truly ruined my feelings for @binance.\n\nI've always seen @cz_binance as such a nice guy and watching him speak thought he cared about the people at @binance. I hope he doesn't know anything about this shady practice and instead its someone else trying to earn points on the team.\n\nMisleading people for short term gain its not the way to get new users to get interested in @binance or the world of blockchain. It is instead a way of discouraging them and they might never want to come back.\n\nI know this can't be @czbinance vision.\n\nu/jjhBnc\nu/Binance\nu/symbiotic_bnb-angel\nu/AutoModerator\nu/symbiotic_bnb\nu/BinanceCS\nu/RIBKA-BINANCE\nu/Dheon5\nu/Nelson_BNB\nu/snate6\nu/tpmv69\nu/BinanceRedditHelp",

The overall size of the PIPE will remain at $400 million since Binance assumes previous PIPE commitments, and Binance's participation will be on basically the same conditions as the existing PIPE investors.\n\nThe transactions with Magnum Opus and Binance are reportedly expected to assist Forbes in maximizing its brand and enterprise values, as well as using its proprietary technology stack and analytics to convert readers into long-term, engaged platform customers, including through memberships and recurring subscriptions to premium content and highly targeted product offerings.\n\nThis is a new sign of increased monopoly of the crypto market by Binance. It had been reported earlier that of the Binance ranked the largest cryptocurrency platform with a value of 21billion$ which is more than Upbit(7.44billion$), Coinflex (5.83B), and Deep Coin(5.51B); the second, third and fourth Crypto platforms put together. \n\nIt is clear that the value of Binance will only continue to increase, with BNB being its currency.

We can only hope the relationship is for the good of humans and of decentralized finance (Defis).",

Then look at this one and join one of the daily AMA's on TG to spot the difference.\n\nToken price is secondary for BANK$.\n\nForget the price of BANK$.  In fact the lower the better for most of us.  Your goal should be to own the highest percentage of the token you can.\n\nHere's why:\n\nIf you can buy up 3% of the tokens you own 3% of the investment fund.  It does not matter what the price does because the investment fund is not influenced by the token price.\n\nThey already put crypto in the investment fund but they have formed a company that is soon going to allow them to include real world assets in the fund. The possibilities are endless but here is one.\n\nLet's say they buy a commercial building for $400,000 and that building appreciates by $200,000. \n\nYou own 3% of that and it will not change as long as you hold and it does NOT matter what the price or volume is.\n\nThis is what makes BANK$ special.",

I have proof for everything to state that I live within the EU. I thought it did not matter what form of ID you sent in, because it is just to prove who you are. Being a dual citizen and making such a small mistake completely banned me from Binance. I cannot event use Binance US at all because I don\u2019t have any address there.
