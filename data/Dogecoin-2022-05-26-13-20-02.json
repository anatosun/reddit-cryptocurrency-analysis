Anyway, he also opened a new checking to use for this purpose & had to wait until Wed for his deposit check to clear, he's sure gonna be ticked that he waited ,,, but you snooze, you lose. And on a lighter not, I convinced my son to invest in Doge so we will be going to the Moon together!!!! It's happening, people who thought I was dumb have seen the $$$ signs that are possible, I'm sure there are many stories just like mine happening around the world.",
