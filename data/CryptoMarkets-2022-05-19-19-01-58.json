I was fed up with living in poverty and decided to go out on my own. It amounted to little more than my remarkable aptitude in fields where no one else was interested.   \n \n\nAll of this is to say that discovering how much I dislike fiat was completely coincidental. Money isn't always viewed as a bad thing. Having a viable trading approach is useful, with the emphasis on the term viable.   \n \n\nI'm simply thankful to be in a world where BTC, ETH, CoinFantasy, and other cryptocurrencies are still in their infancy, allowing us to put them to good use and improve everyone's quality of life on the planet.",
