It's how Hitler managed to convince half the nation of Germany that some other group of people should die. \n\nIf we don't find an antidote for propaganda this world is destined to just nuke the shit out of itself and die. I guess the rich elite in their bunkers might survive but even they won't like the world that comes next. \n\nSometimes I wonder what would happen if the entire internet would stop working.\n\nit might actually be good.",
