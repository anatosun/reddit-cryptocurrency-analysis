I have a ledger and I am aware I can restore it through them. \n\nThe whole point is I want to know I can go somewhere else, like an online wallet, with the same word list and have access to accounts if I needed to.\n\nI have tried 7 or 8 different wallets (all online wallets) and all of them generate a new list for a new wallet. None had an option to enter your own list. (Unless its a wallet you had with them and you want to restore it).\n\nIn fact even having a legitimate existing key doesn\u2019t help because no option to use it.\n\nI know they are out there. Figured it\u2019s quicker to ask than keep downloading wallets.\n\nCan anyone suggest any that would allow this?",
