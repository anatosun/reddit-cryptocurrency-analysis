When this account popped up on my credit report, it showed that I  had only made two payments even though I had not missed a single  payment. I filed a dispute with the credit bureaus and contacted my  lender to fix the problem on my credit report. They've been back and forth for months now with no signs of repair.

The agent confirmed that my funds arrived in my Coinbase account, but I do not see them yet and has not responded to my follow-up inquiry to assist with the completion of this transaction. Please escalate this issue and help resolve!\n\nThis is the block explorer link: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0xafdc6bbe5409e93894a80948756f86d33b33c1992ac5c0420ba4b7233b54c193](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xafdc6bbe5409e93894a80948756f86d33b33c1992ac5c0420ba4b7233b54c193)",

Your IOU is right at the bottom of the list of creditors, and it will be used to pay off secured creditors and tax it owes before you get back pennies on the dollar 3 years later.",

Coinbase will basically say you gave them access to your account and not help recover funds. Your best hope is to completely lock the account so no funds transfer until you re-submit kyc. Check device log ins in yahoo and make sure no one else is still logged in and watching emails. You can also find when the attacker gained access to yahoo.",

The charge is for $14.99 and it happens even after getting a new card and before I activate it. I has happened for the last 3 months. Deezer customer service is useless. I highly doubt that it is the same scammer stealing my info and making the AE charge again and again.\n\nUPDATE: The reason why the recurrent charges kept appearing is because even though the card was reported Lost or Stolen and a new card was issued, the old card remained active. There I was thinking that my card was hacked again when in fact is was the previous card that kept allowing the charges.",

I called Coinbase support line, 1-888-908-7930, and told the Coinbase employee my situation. The Coinbase employee gave me a website address that started with tawk.to and said that was the official help desk and they could help me. This website is a scam. They stated that I should buy 1 ETH and put it into my account, send them my seed code, and my account would be unlocked. Of course I didn\u2019t do this. \n\nThe next day, I was getting unknown login attempts to my account and multiple texts with verification codes. I checked account activity, and the IP trying to log in was from Nigeria. I sent a help ticket to Coinbase and they responded with a script form email stating my account was locked and they could give me no further information. I continued to attempt to report this incident to Coinbase, only to be ignored multiple times over a 2-week period. \n\nCoinbase is still refusing to unlock my account, even though they are the ones responsible for the unauthorized login attempts to my account. Can Coinbase support please help me to get my account restriction lifted and my account unlocked?",

They cash it out and send you your fiat all legally (you never received or sent the Crypto \"illegally\" and was paid for your services in fiat).",

I\u2019m planning to do that next time. It takes a few days instead of instant with Plaid, but no big deal.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention, Plaid is legit. It\u2019s not a phishing attempt.

We'd also ask you ensure your VPN is turned off as this can sometimes cause an issue. \n\nIf this doesn't resolve your issue, please send us your case number and we'll check this.\n\nWe hope this helps!",

I wait. Days pass and it continues to say that my account is under review so I get in contact via a phone call with Coinbase support, they refer my case to their support team who handles these situations and I receive an email asking for documents, I provide these said documents and answer(s) to their questions, and today at 2:30 am I get an automated email saying \"your case has been closed\" when my issue still has not been solved. \n\nI have been patient, I have been calm and all I've wanted to do was be able to buy/sell/trade my funds. I seriously need help.",

I called again this morning and spoke with an foreign woman who could barely understand me. After a long call that went nowhere, she said that she had escalated the issue and that I would get an email from tech support. That was 3 hours ago and still no email. I don't keep any money in CB but they are my fiat on ramp of choice due to CB Pro having no trading fees. BTC is crashing and I want to buy but due to CB incompetence I have to use another platform. Looks like I will be making a Kraken account today and cancelling my CB Pro.\n\nEdit: all the downvotes from morons simping for CB is pathetic",

I have a friend I introduced to it and we've been making payments to each other with crypto so we can do our bit to increase adoption. She created a Coinbase account and I have the trust wallet app so she usually pay me for stuff by buying crypto on Coinbase and sending to my wallet address.\n\nOn May 1st, she bought \u00a330 worth of bitcoin and tried to send it to my address, somehow the transaction wasn't going on her end and in the end only \u00a325 got to me. On May 4th she bought \u00a330 worth of bitcoin again and tried to send it to my address, she sent it to the exact same address she sent the earlier one to but it didn't go through on my end.\n\nShe came over and I did some enquiries. Basically, this is what I think happened, when she tried to send the \u00a330 on May 1st, somehow it went through an address and that address relayed \u00a325 to me and sent \u00a35 to another address. And when she tried to do the latter transaction, she had just basically sent the money to the relay address since that's what showed up on the transaction history, and that money is just stuck there.\n\nI'm new to all of this so I don't understand at all what happened. Also, I just noticed that any time money came through on my end it showed it coming from a different address. Every single transaction was from a different address even though she used the same app every time. I know it isn't a lot of money at all, but it's disheartening introducing crypto to someone and the person just keeps running into problems. I've checked the transaction hash of most of the transactions we made and I don't understand anything. Why does a transaction show more than 60 outputs when we just sent it to one address? Please helpful advice would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\n\nEdit: Just so you know, I'm the last person that'll fall for any scam. All of you fucking weirdo scammers that are messaging me should just leave me alone. I know all your tricks already. I just want some advice.",

All the addresses your wallet generates are controlled by your private keys. When I started learning about crypto, it helped a lot to learn about how UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) work in bitcoin and how each transaction has many inputs and many outputs (some of which may be \"change\" outputs that go back to an address controlled by the sender's wallet). If you post the transaction hashes of the transactions you're talking about and identify which addresses belong to you and your friend, I'd be happy to try and help you figure out what happened!",

I completed KYC pretty much as soon as I signed up. The explanation for this is generic at best. Coinbase needs to come clean about this and answer the following questions properly. \n\nWhy is it necessary?\n\nCoinbase needs to come clean about what triggered this. Is it something your identify provider did wrong, lose a disk? Did you fail an audit for some reason? Did my withdrawing 4 solana 1 day suddenly trigger an oh my god the customer is actually using their crypto what are we gonna do when we can't borrow it ourselves and earn yield? So Coinbase pull your socks up, tie your shoe laces, start treating us like grown ups and we'll return the favor. If you don't have the humility to level with us then we have no reason to trust you.\n\nSo if you have volumes of funds going in and out that trigger this kind of thing, then it should be published policy? Hard to imagine that the few thousands I dabble with would trigger any kind of genuine requirement \n\nAlso Coinbase needs to make sure its email look the same when it makes a request like this. They need to have the same corporate address, the same graphics and the same email domain as the regular coinbase emails. They also need to make sure the dates are the same. I have two emails from you with different required by dates in the same month and when I login I have yet another date to do this by with a different month. It looks very scammy so the emails were ignored. \n\nAlso note that my iPhone won't run your latest version of the app because you dropped support for that version iOS, so telling your customers to use the app will not be without its exceptions.\n\nOh and another thing, it is possible to legally present and resident in a country without an ID for that country. Think of all those people who arrive on work visas. So the requirement that the id comes from the country they are setting up in is also unnecessarily burdensome and restrictive, maybe it could also counts as discrimination.",

There was no explanation of whether it was resolved and if they did anything.  It took me a few more days to finally logged back in because Coinbase decided it didn't want to send device confirmation emails to my email anymore and the support staff were no help.  I changed to a different email address on Coinbase and was able to log in again.  Well, there was still no money in my Coinbase account.  The history still shows all my cryptos got converted to LTC and does not show what happened after  \n\nI called support again.  They couldn't tell me anything, just opened another case and locked my account again.  I just filed an FBI/IC3 report hoping they can help get my money back.  No one should be able to get in my account.  Even if they have my password, they don't have my phone/text.  And if I said \"No\" to whether I made the transaction, the transaction shouldn't have happened.  This is frustrating.  \n\nWhat do I do?  Anyone else have similar experience with Coinbase Support?

Although Coinbase Card can be used anywhere Visa is accepted, there are certain merchant categories which are prohibited as purchases, currently including Cryptocurrency business. This does prevent you from using your Coinbase card to purchase crypto.\n\nFor all available payment methods to purchase crypto, check out this [article](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/add-a-payment-method/payment-methods-for-us-customers).\n\nJust to note, Coinbase card works in the following way. You can use your Coinbase card to spend cash or any of the cryptocurrencies that you own. Coinbase will automatically convert all cryptocurrency to US Dollars and transfer the funds to your Coinbase Card (less conversion fees) for use in purchases and ATM withdrawals.\n\nHope this helps!",

Thankfully she had 2FA enabled but they must have tricked Coinbase somehow because even with 2FA, they were able to have almost 300k USD withdrawn to an unknown bank via a transaction initiated by Coinbase support. \n\nOn Friday, my friend received an email stating that a withdrawal has been initiated to destination 'admin' (usually it says the bank name and last for digits of account but not this time) and that the money should arrive within 5 business days. She immediately contacted Coinbase but was told that her account was locked due to unauthorized access and that nothing could be done until she restored access. She begged and cried and asked them to stop the withdrawal of her life savings to a bank account that's not hers but the agents refused to help, even hung up on her multiple times. I'm honestly in shock.\n\nToday, 2 days later she gained access to her account again but the transaction history still doesn't show which bank the withdrawal went to (only says Coinbase admin) and Coinbase STILL refuses to provide information that would help law enforcement to contact the receiving bank and have the transfer stopped before it's too late.\n\nWhat the heck can she do. Why is Coinbase not helping her get the money back?!\n\nEDIT: spoke to Coinbase this morning. They said that someone internally made a mistake but that the ticket had to be escalated to find out more details. He said there's a 50/50 chance the money hasn't left Coinbase yet but he also wouldn't share which bank account the transfer was sent to.",

Its a simple question, what bank and account number were the funds transfered to?\n\nCFPB, I guarantee you can find that out.  If coinbase delays, CFPB will assign an investigator to your case along with their legal department and get to the bottom of it.   This is a huge sum, 250k.  I personally went up against the largest bank on the planet, CHASE BANK, and CFPB got their legal department to make it right for me.  CFPB is worth every tax dollar it receives.\n\nQuestion to ask your friend,\n\n1 did your friend have coinbase one membership that recently started?  They offer 1 million in asset protection?\n\n2  Like the poster below asked, is the source of her coins legitimate or from a shady source?    I just read your comment below.   No, she sold her house and wanted to buy some crypto now that it dropped so much.   thats about as legitimate as you can get!  \n\nLike others have mentoioned, have her file CFPB, takes litterally 10 mins and include support ticket numbers and then let CFPB find out the name and account number.  \n\nThis is some scary chit with coinbase!",

I am looking to up my investment in my accounts, but I hear Coinbase has a history of locking people's **Exchange Accounts** and having poor support for those that do.\n\nI heard about coinbase wallet, and thought wow this is great. I have been looking for a wallet to host my Ethereum for some time now since Metamask is fairly awful and the rest are kind of iffy.\n\nMy question is, the same way Coinbase can lock you out of your **Exchange account** for various reasons, can they manually lock you out or disable your **Wallet account** as well? I am not talking about losing your seed phrase, I am talking about Coinbase HQ disabling access to my wallet completely. Is this possible or no?",

They claim that the wallet that they control is self custody but they hold the private keys and it is unable to be restored to anywhere else except coinbase wallet. The fees for transfers from coinbase exchange to coinbase wallet are stupid tarded compared to other exchanges like [crypto.com](https://crypto.com). The wallet is not WEB3 and unable to connect with [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) or other WEB3 compliant tracking systems to regulate and revoke access to your wallets. It was cheaper to transfer my shib out of coinbase exchange to my MetaMask wallet than to transfer to my Coinbase wallet. Just because it is popular does not mean it is safe or even equitable for anything concerning Defi or Mining.",

I trade with Kraken but decided to open an account with Coinbase just as plan B and diversify.\n\nAnyway, with Kraken, when I want to add fiat funds, I click 'funding>deposit' and it shows a page with a EU bank IBAN. I then transfer the money from my bank, or Revolut, or Wise etc. to that and all done. Same with a credit card. In other words, I do not need (neither want to) to have a payment method on file there.\n\nI was wondering why Coinbase - after verification - keeps asking me on each and every page  to add a payment method and put my private cc or bank details on file with them? Having my credit card on file there and running my bots and the market moves or whatever, would they automatically keep sucking fiat money from my credit card?",

The delivery date will be shown on the Trade Confirmation page before your order is submitted. You can see when the funds are expected to arrive on your History page. \n\nIf you reside in one of the states that supports the Coinbase USD Wallet, sells into your USD Wallet will occur instantly. \n\nTo know more about this, you can visit this link: [https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/buying-selling-or-converting-crypto/how-long-does-a-sell-or-withdrawal-take-to-complete](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/buying-selling-or-converting-crypto/how-long-does-a-sell-or-withdrawal-take-to-complete)\n\nHope this helps! Many thanks!",

Their support got better couple months ago when they hired a bunch of people but it seems to have gone to pot again or they\u2019re just being difficult with me.  \n\n\nTwo items:  \n\n\n1-I\u2019ve had a loan out with them for about a year and I have been paying my interest every month or they\u2019ve been taking it out. All of a sudden they paid themselves back out of my collateral a third of the loan without any\u00a0 explanation. And again, I was paying my interest. Now they won\u2019t give me an explanation and they won\u2019t replace the $2000.  \n\n\n2-The other problem is I have excess collateral by at least 30% and they won\u2019t let me take it out of the vault. After I complained\u00a0 I got $1000 out but without any explanation all of a sudden it was available.  \n\n\nThey seem to do what they want and when they want to.  \n\n\nI\u2019m surprised that there aren\u2019t more complaints.  \n\n\nI have two tickets. It\u2019s been about seven days since I contacted them again and no response. These are not difficult things to answer.  \n\n\nThanks",

I was new to the crypto game and trusted Coinbase's advertisement that the company had insurance to cover losses.  The platform allowed someone to transfer out my crypto unto an Ethereum wallet.  That individual traded all my crypto (13 different ones) for Ethereum and then transferred it out of my Coinbase account.  The company has refused to make good and reimburse me for the theft.  There was no notification that something was going on as it happened.  Their system didn't identify that anything suspicious was going on to stop it.  I lost almost $14,000.00.  I have asked to go to Arbitration and Coinbase has refused to answer my repeated requests to do so.  Coinbase is not abiding by their own Client agreement.    Does anyone have any idea as to how I can go about getting Coinbase to make good and liveup to its advertising and claim to be the safest and best crypto platform outthere?  What other legal avenues or otherwise do you suggest?",

Being a victim of phishing means you entered the link, which was your own decision not coinbases fault.\n\nBut if you want more secured and better tech in a digital wallet, I would suggest using Gridlock. Gridlock is the safest cryptocurrency storage platform available in my opinion. It works by splitting encryption keys into tiny pieces and distributing them across multiple devices. You get the combined protection from all devices and simultaneously mitigate any possible weaknesses.",

You can join one of the class actions but they will all be dismissed, just like the dozens before them.\n\nCoinbase has at least 4 separate security systems built into user accounts. If you are appropriately using 2FA (not text base) and whitelisting, they will make good on their guarantee. Here's the hitch: if you're using all security mechanisms as they are intended, it is essentially impossible for your funds to be stolen.\n\nWhat happened to you was still a crime, but CB will essentially tell you it's not their fault you left the keys to your front door sitting right on the porch.",

Its annoying coz every week I like to buy 4 to $500 to reload my CB debit card. Now I have to buy $100 worth that many times. Anyone else having this annoyance? Is work around just the website?

Before your account can be closed, you\u2019ll need to withdraw your crypto funds to an external wallet and your cash funds to a bank account associated with your Coinbase account. If you are currently enrolled in USD Coin rewards, you may want to wait up to 40 days before withdrawing funds to ensure you have received all eligible reward payouts. You will not be able to access these funds after account closure. Please take precautions when transferring cryptocurrency to an external wallet as transfers outside of Coinbase are irreversible. Please also be sure to delete any external references to cryptocurrency addresses generated by Coinbase, as funds sent to those addresses will not be accessible once the account is closed. If you have any questions you may visit* [*https://support.coinbase.com*](https://support.coinbase.com/)*.* \n\nOk.  W/E.  \n\nThis issue I'm having is when I'm trying to withdraw my ETH Coinbase is not sending me a SMS code from that page.  \n\nI know why this is because my 2FA is set up with using a security key.  I've tried using the security key as the code and even an older code before I had this other security set up.  \n\nI've contacted Coinbase multiple times already, but have been given non answers.  Basically I feel like I'm stuck in limbo right now.\n\nHas anyone had experience with this?  or any tips?  I only feel like my next step is litigation, but Coinbase could fix this by unlocking my account for a brief period for me to correct this by downgrading my security to SMS and then I can fully complete the transfers and be done.",

I have given up looking for somewhere to stake it ($400 to stake for 0.5%APY, results of a failed scale) and decided to search for a bridge to get it out of ETH (or even send to another wallet or something that will allow me to bridge without paying more than I have) I'm not able to bridge anything in Coinbase wallet without ETH and so very scared to put more ETH in their just to pay twice the amount of money to get it back out. Is this money in my wallet basically worthless and I just have to pray ETH2 will save me? \n\nAny solutions appreciated. Matter of fact, game time: for anyone who can help me get my WBTC and CURVE back with at least a $20-$30 appreciation, the $5 BTC is yours. Will even send you another 20 CRO (\u2248$5) for the time and help. Hope this isn't considered soliciting lol but I'm desperate for my dust! Thanks Coinbase fam!",

Unfortunately, I have a quantity of ETH that is currently staking as ETH2 so I am unable to make a withdrawal to another wallet. Please assist in resolution as I worry about the account closing with funds being lost.\n\nIs it possible to have the balance converted back to normal ETH so I can withdraw the coins?\nThat would be the best and easiest solution",

When it is time for you to sell do the reverse and cash-out into your bank; crossing your fingers.\n\nI actually don't think you will have any problems doing this as a \"Citizen\" of the US.

With just one employee dedicated to it they could get everyone's assets sent back to within a decent time and could even have the people who accidentally sent the funds then fund their own gas fee and charge a service fee in order for Coinbase to send the tokens back. Problem here is Coinbase wants to make people think it's hard and that you need a special \"engineer\" to do it! That's garbage, the only issue here is Coinbase just doesn't \"want to\" send the funds back. Should be a class action lawsuit against them for this practice. They're a publicly traded American Exchange folks! Group together and use the force of law to get your assets back!

I also got some cardano when cb first offered in april with apy and the ticker has not worked for that either. I contacted cb twice, cb did get back to me and said they were aware of the bug and would honor the missing rewards. Im concerned because they call it a bug, but it began right after the \"scheduled matinence\" listed on their incidents report. I think they are going to drastically lower the tezos rewards like they did algorand last month. I hope the protection from \"pump and dumps\" congress is speaking of includes staking rewards. If i have to keep my assests for a year in order to lessen the tax hit on gains, these exchanges should have to disclose the dates that they will offer apy through so they cant up and change their policies whenever it favors them. especially after all that insider trading was revealed.",

All on the same day, my saitama and eth all got withdrawn to addresses that I don't know at all:\n\n0x24d83b67104d7d1dbea86c6acb62cc03e58eeea8\n\n0x8b3192f5eebd8579568a2ed41e6feb402f93f73f\n\n0x9cbfb60a09a9a33a10312da0f39977cbdb7fde23\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking further, the below are their transaction hashes:-\n\n0x5ad9bda5dfc36e0d0ab683028d4ea897f6bc6443f8996e242a3a9d388b20fc2f\n\n0xdc1eff3ba4921282a82a2d0c04647fdc254343ec8a98e92d7213b4d75236111d\n\n0x2148b104b99e3a97e478ccfdd263429cd3303bba3a5c622faaa5642c363baf2d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes that mean my coinbase wallet has been hacked...?\n\nI contacted coinbase and they said it's my responsibility as wallet is user-controlled and my recovery phase might get exposed. I don't recall this has ever happened.\n\nThe other thing which seems very unusual but not sure if it's related to this, is that when I tried to start my coinbase wallet apps on my phone today, it takes forever to load and seems to hang. I had to restart it a couple times and finally when it started successfully, it shows my account has been drained...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease help. Thanks in advance...\n\nsmc",

To help give you an idea of ways third parties can attempt to scam a wallet, check out this [article](https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/other-topics/avoiding-crypto-scams), which goes through the examples of illegitimate dapps, giveaway scams, phishing attempts and airdropped tokens.\n\nGenerally speaking, it's best to interact only with trusted entities and reputable dapps (which you can check on [Walletlink](https://www.walletlink.org/#/)). Make sure to keep your seed phrase safe too as if this is shared/obtained with others either virtually or physically, there's a possibility they could access/transfer your funds without your knowledge.\n\nAs Coinbase wallet is a self-custody crypto wallet, it puts you solely in control of your crypto, keys, and data. You alone '*hold the keys to the kingdom*' as it were, and therefore are solely responsible for the security of it.\n\nWe hope this helps!",

            "selftext": "Recently I noticed some unexpected behavior when depositing funds into either my USD wallet or making a direct purchase (BTC for example but could be any), from my linked bank account. Typically, I like to purchase crypto on Coinbase, then transfer the funds to my Ledger Nano or a different exchange, and usually, I'm allowed to make the deposit AND send the crypto off of the exchange all within the same day (Not sure if there is a fixed limit because I can't find it on the Help page but I was always allowed to buy and send up to $1,000 in crypto instantly). \n\nWhen trying this yesterday, however, I'm now being limited to only having instant buy and sell activity, and transfers take \"3-5\" business days until the funds deposited via ACH are cleared. My initial thought was that since I bought BTC directly (without depositing to my USD wallet first like I usually do) was why I couldn't instantly transfer, but even after depositing the same amount in USD to offset the pending transfer $ amount, I still have to wait (not only that, but it's saying I have to wait 8 days for funds to clear which feels weird since I've always used this bank account/never had to wait that long). This Reddit thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nnzyp5/how\\_to\\_deposit\\_and\\_instantly\\_transferstake\\_while/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nnzyp5/how_to_deposit_and_instantly_transferstake_while/) mentions this in case \"instant buy -> transfer/send\" functionality doesn't sound possible to some. \n\nDoes anyone know if instant withdraws/send capabilities have changed recently, or if this could be a byproduct of my current location/state? (live in a crypto-friendly state anyways so wouldn't think so)",

Not sure if it's because I phrased the question wrong but I'm just gonna try and resay it if it changes anything -- I converted ETH to UST today on coinbase wallet and it was fine, my balance was correct and good. Then on coinbase wallet I sent the UST straight to my coinbase account. Now I've called the coinbase rep that said everything looked good and is handing it to a higher up to see if there's any difference. Don't wanna be annoying, just scared that I lost my money. And what should I have changed? I've looked up \"add token\" online for coinbase wallet but I ain't see nothing. And you think I lost all of it or is there a chance that I could still get it?

I sent them to my coinbase wallet, but here it gets tricky.\n\n\n\nWhen I try to convert them to BSE, it doesn't work. It tells me I can't afford it because of Network Fees in ETH. Then I read up about it and it says I just leave some money to cover the fees. I did, it still didn't work.\n\nThen I thought maybe I should convert them to ETH first, but I can't because it says I can't afford the network fees because it is in ETH.\n\nSo then I thought, I'll create a wallet elsewhere and transfer it there.... and I can't..because you guessed it... I cannot cover the transfer fee... that is in ETH...",

Coinbase you are trash and i have no idea how you are still in buisness. i hope the people who design this app to steal your money burn in hell.",

It\u2019s still not a price the exchange sets though.

Unfortunately, the API-secret is not visible anywhere, any longer and I've seen others complain about this as well. It's been this way for at least a month now, so I've tried using the contact-form on the help-pages, but you know what? It doesn't work. I've tried calling, you know what? No one is available and the call is just cut off. I've tried three major browsers with varying results, but the information I need has simply been stripped away.\n\nI just realised as I'm writing this, that I don't have to deal with this if I just transfer everything to another exchange that I have better experience with.

If I get any further info from CB on my case, I will share that also.",

On Coinbase it says the instant send is $1000/day. What is the limit on Coinbase pro? Am I able to buy $1400 of bitcoin and instantly send it all? If I\u2019m not what are my options? My first thought was to only buy $1000 of bitcoin on Coinbase, send it, and then wait one day to buy and send the other $400 so I don\u2019t have to wait multiple days for a single purchase to settle. Would this work, and are there any better options?",

It's a different shade,font,and size. I snatched his phone and went to the token address, it was all zeros except one x \"00x000000...\" \nhe then opens his metamask and goes to spookyswap and two different similar assets show up in the swap tab but not in his metamask wallet???? \n Disconnect bank accounts and change all phrases and passwords.. but realistically is there a ln answer to what is happening and a solution??

Two weeks later the response I get is that because they can\u2019t see any denied transactions, they determine that there are no denied transactions on the card. It\u2019s disrespectful, meaning, that I\u2019m delusional? Obviously a bug. Meanwhile I keep using the card and it keeps being denied.  Two issues here: (1) Random denied transactions (2) they don\u2019t show on the app log. This is real, and hardcore fans of CB card will downvote this message as they have other post I made on how the card is unreliable. But folks need to know how unreliable it can be.

Thankfully, I got it back after a week.   \nI just don\u2019t know how the person logged into my account on an unfamiliar device to change the Face ID. I never got any email notification. \nI personally think they got access to it by accessing my email since that one was the only one I had with one data breach that occurred by YouNow in 2019. They also bypassed my Microsoft Authenticator app somehow.  \nHope you get your account back.",

Now coinbase takes over and everything is a mess.   Record of mining eth coming in.   But no record of it being transferred out, last transfer was in, and I have 0 balance (had previous balance also).   Right at the time the mining eth was transferred in to old BRD wallet, now coinbase wallet . I got a Eth deposit of the balance minus fee's  in a coinbase exchange account I haven't used with Coinbase wallet , nor is attached.   Whats going on Coinbase???   You took fee's to do the transfer and I never approved the transfer.\n\nCan't send you a message as it keeps bringing me to a chat bot that won't answer anything.   When ask to contact coinbase it brings me to a page to send message Coinbase for a split second then puts me back into the chat bot without doing anything.",

To do this i had to contact my bank a head of time to authurize the big purchase and also had to connect my bank account directly to coinbase for the large sum. This took quit some time and the transaction was completed and fully approved through coinbase. After all that waiting, coinbase will only let me send 1,000 of those funds to an external wallet on day 1. I called customer support and found out that they are holding the rest of my funds for 10 days. They will not dismiss the 10 day waiting period for any reason. They said it was do to security reasons but imo its for their analitics of their site because it looks good on them to have that amont of money invested on their platform. Support told me that they use to allow sending a request for dismissle of the 10 day hold period but not anymore. Why is this even a thing? In the crypto space, time is not on ur side. I spent cash for crypto currency that passed all security protocals that they will not allow me to use outside of their platform. Its my money! Not okay!

If that was the case for me then I wouldnt have lost a decent amount of money late last year.  A hacker got into my Coinbase account late last year and used my linked bank account to purchase BTC and then immediately transfered the BTC out to their own wallet.  They also used the USD's I had sitting on the exchange to purchase more BTC and immediately transfer that out as well.  All of the USD deposits, BTC purchases, and BTC transfers out took them about 30-45 minutes.  So atleast for my account there was no wait time between a deposit/purchase being made and when those USD's or crpyto could be transfered back out.  Coinbase didnt wait for the deposit to clear my bank account before they allowed all this to happen.  I think it was sometime in 2020 or 2021 when Coinbase announced that deposits where instantly available for trade, but to this day I'm perplexed that there wasnt some delay on withdrawals.  I caught the hackers actions just a few hours after it happened and I would have been able to prevent the withdrawals if there was any delay at all on withdrawals.  I was on Coinbase for a few years so maybe they just trusted my account I dont know.\n\nTechnically I dont think they have to wait to make funds available for withdrawing back out, but its certainly in their interest to delay it so the funds clear the source first.  Why they allowed it on my account I dont know.  The hacker had enough suspicious activity on the account that it should have raised a red flag to Coinbase and they atleast blocked the withdrawals but instead they let it all go through.  Changing passwords, signing in from a different IP and different computer and from a location that I have never signed in from.  Then immediately try to make deposits/purchases/withdrawals that were unusual for my account.  You would think they would have security measures in place to notice when there is enough suspicious activity and prevent the immediate withdrawing of funds, but not so for my account.  Supposedly alot of people have had their accounts locked or suspended for \"suspicious activity\" but the hackers suspicious activity on my account was ridiculous and it was all A-OK with Coinbase.",

Automatic transfers out of Coinbase wallet (Loved BRD, Coinbase wallet does what it wants with no records of transfers out when coinbase does automatically).

No record of transfer out in the coinbase wallet, but showed up in a coinbase account that isn't attached, minus fee's of course.   I have no clue why they would do this.   They took new deposit and old balance and transferred it all on they're own.   And again no record of the transfer out in my wallet, just the recent deposit from my mining pool, and 0 balance.",

A few hours later I noticed that my account is restricted and is flagged for manual review. What I should\u2019ve done at that time was to dispute the charge on my credit card and cancel the transaction, but unfortunately I didn\u2019t because I thought they have a legit business and will take care of it. So, I reached out to customer service and it took them several months to reply and then they asked me to upload a copy of my identity documents through some random website. Now, given that Coinbase website itself was hacked, why should I trust a random website introduced by Coinbase to upload my documents? So, I figured the amount of crypto I have in my account is not worth it to upload my documents through their method which is not safe (in my opinion. Obviously they think it\u2019s safe, but I do not trust data safety comments from a company that has been hacked before) and might create a bigger headache for me in future. So, I gave up at this point; it doesn\u2019t feel good though; I feel like my money is stolen.",

                    "response": "A little more detail to my question. I am trying to figure out the cheapest way to send $5k worth of BTC to a crypto project. They only accept BTC and USDT (Tron). I have sent BTC (max $500) to them using my basic Coinbase account but the fees are a little high. The fees to buy/send $5k BTC would be ridiculous. \n\nSo I am trying to find a cheaper way to accomplish this. From what I have read, it would be cheaper for me to wire the money into a Coinbase Pro account, purchase the BTC. Then transfer the BTC to my Coinbase account, then send the BTC to the crypto project. From what I have read I am unable to send crypto from a Coinbase Pro account to a recipient, hence the reason for transferring it to the basic Coinbase account first. \n\nCan anyone confirm this would be the best/correct way to accomplish this?",

            "selftext": "2022 is destined to be a key year for blockchain globalization, and it is also a key year for many blockchain companies to go to sea for global expansion. Driven by the violent bull market in the past year, the enthusiasm of digital currency investors around the world has been high, and the number of digital currency exchanges has also grown rapidly. From the product point of view, the exchange contains digital currency trading and investment just need business, is the first entrance to blockchain traffic, just demand, high frequency, long retention time, but under the rapid growth of the exchange, the test of incremental development, operational stability and other trading capabilities has also risen rapidly.  \nAs the world's leading blockchain overall technology service provider, Peaksoft will help exchanges remain competitive in the market.  \n**Standardized services based on incremental markets**  \nThe global market value of cryptocurrencies has reached a trillion scale, and the number of holders has reached 200 million. However, seemingly huge volume, only about 30% of the countries in the world have digital asset exchanges.\n\nThe Peaksoft team believes that in the entire digital currency trading market, the existing investors have been large-scale dispersed in the case of the emergence of thousands of exchanges, and when new trading models and gameplay appear, large-scale user transfer events will occur. Moreover, under the role of emerging new investment methods, chaotic currencies, and bear markets, investors' investment ability is obviously weak, and digital currency trading urgently needs to open up the incremental market.  \nAiden Chao, chief market officer of Peaksoft, said, \"There is still a large incremental market for exchanges to expand, and many new users have not formed a stable understanding of head exchanges such as coinbase. On the other hand, the cost input of exchanges is much lower than that of ecological projects such as public chains, which gives emerging transactions the opportunity to catch up in the incremental period. \u201d\n\nPeaksoft provides a holistic exchange business development solution for users with a wide range of traffic channels in traditional industries around the world, and standardizes the solution structure, which can solve various problems encountered by new exchanges from entry-level to mature exchanges. In terms of services, Peaksoft empowers new exchanges with exchange SaaS services, and Peaksoft's customer service department is 7\u00d724 years a year to provide customers with professional and comprehensive after-sales support services.  \nPeaksoft's SaaS system provides a lightweight, free solution for new exchanges. With the Peaksoft Exchange SaaS system, customers only need to simply register to have the exchange's trading capabilities. The Peaksoft Exchange SaaS system supports coin trading + contract trading + wallet solution + innovative fast contract gameplay. Moreover, Peaksoft gives the new exchange complete \"independent autonomy\", and the right to upload the currency is independently controlled by the user of the system, so the Peaksoft exchange SaaS system also provides a \"launchpad\" function, and the exchange can independently create new coins online and other activities, which is convenient and easy to operate. In the course of SaaS services, the partner exchange can be privatized at any time, and the data can be panned directly to the privatized exchange.\n\nAiden chao said, \"For the entire exchange industry, the number of exchanges is not enough to meet the needs of the future market, the number of exchanges still has a large increment, joining the giant ecosystem can help emerging exchanges to obtain short-term gains, but not a long-term solution, when the emerging exchanges want to complete privatization, rapid development, ecological restrictions will make it lose the ability to explosive growth.\" What Peaksoft has to do is to help emerging exchanges return users, technologies, etc. to themselves, so that when the exchange enters a period of rapid development, there will be no worries.  \n\ud83d\udcf7  \n**The smart choice for customers around the world**\n\nPeaksoft has helped the emerging exchanges progress and grow, and has achieved some success in the service experience of the past few years.\n\nIn order for exchanges to survive and thrive, traffic and experience are two important factors. Although the market competition is fierce, but with the progress of the industry, the influx of external users is inevitable, Peaksoft believes that if the exchange can focus on the ease of use of the platform, liquidity, security, service capabilities, there will be opportunities to become a new head brand.\n\nPeaksoft has experienced hundreds of exchanges around the world from building trading volumes to experiencing high-frequency trading. Through stable technology and optimization of daily trading, Peaksoft has successfully supported more than 50 exchanges to stand in overseas market segments.\n\nThe Peaksoft team has incorporated a variety of play styles for emerging exchanges. First of all, Peaksoft will cover the entire service system, establish a full set of systems around blockchain digital currency transactions (including spot, contract, innovation contract, etc.), and expand the product form to the three ends (PC, APP, H5). Secondly, with the entry of new ways of playing in the industry, solutions such as speed contracts, independent coin listing, holding coins mining, and flash exchange are added.  \nFor the background of exchange operation, the development of a robot system for transaction liquidity is used to optimize transaction matching, as well as a variety of intelligent auxiliary tools to help operators easily manage the entire exchange platform and form ecological assistance in product layout. For the C-side, provide a user-friendly and excellent front-end interface that keeps up with market acceptance. In the context of the globalization of exchange business, it is available in twelve languages to help emerging exchanges carry out global business. Peaksoft has been at the forefront of the market, constantly iterating on products and providing lifetime free iteration updates for all customers we work with.\n\nAt present, Peaksoft's Saas service has been launched, forming the service standard with the widest range of service transactions, the lowest cost, and the choice of privatization at any time, and has also formed the basis for assisting the growth of emerging exchanges.\n\nThere are many exchanges, the development boom of the blockchain industry is accelerating globally, the number of platforms that have surged has become the appearance of the market, and the standardized underlying technology is the best way to educate users, as the first entrance to the blockchain exchange, mature trading experience and technical service capabilities can make the platform stand firm in this industry, after all, users will also consider from many aspects when choosing an exchange, and excellent products can make users make decisions decisively.  \nAcross the industry, Peaksoft aims to be a solid backing for the growth of emerging exchanges. After all, the tide fighter relies not only on the body and courage, but most importantly on the solid hull and stable sails under the feet.",

Use hardware 2FA\n2. Use a unique random user-id\n4. Link to a secure, unique, random phone number, or none at all\n3. Link to a secure, unique, random email address\n4. Disable password reset and 2FA reset on your email\n5. Use unique random passwords on all\n6. Enable \"2FA required for everything\"\n7. Enable \"Whitelists required for withdraws\"\n7. Always log out of all CB browser sessions\n8. Always visit CB in incognito / amnesic mode\n9. Always use a proxied bank account with minimum balance\n\nMost every exploit works by taking over the users linked email or phone number then impersonating the user with a \"lost phone / lost 2FA\" request.  Hardware 2FA might help, but until CB tightens the \"lost 2FA\" workflow, you need to stop recycling email and use a dedicated account.  Honestly, you should anyway so you don't have to trust CB to not f*ck it up.",

Other reasons for failed transactions can include surpassing your daily spend limit or if our system detects the transaction as 'high risk'.\n\nCoinbase Card can be used anywhere that Visa is accepted, with the exception of the prohibited merchant categories (which are listed in this [article](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/coinbase-card/coinbase-card-for-the-us#using-coinbase-card) under the heading 'Where can and can't I use the Coinbase Card?').\n\nIf you'd like for us to look into this specific transaction further, you'll need to write to our team directly [here](https://help.coinbase.com/en/contact-us). Once you do so, a member of the appropriate team will review and respond with their findings.\n\nWe hope this info helps!",

I\u2019ve had this happen before, not with Tesla, but with State Farm and it seems like sometimes Plaid has an error when validating the amount\n\nEdit: by manual way, I mean adding your account and routing number and Coinbase uses a small charge to verify.

But the login page that looks like a new design (I see it when I visit this URL [coinbase.com/login](https://coinbase.com/login)), regardless of using the right password, does not work. I always get the error \"Invalid email or password. Try clicking 'Forgot Password' if you're having trouble signing in.\" Then when I click \"Forgot password\" it directs me to [coinbase.com/signin](https://www.coinbase.com/signin) which is clearly an old Coinbase login page. This login page is the only one that works. Entering my password prompts the verification code and I can login totally normally.\n\nI can reproduce this over and over, in every browser, and in Incognito Mode. Anyone know what's going on? Also it's been like this for weeks (maybe months?). Crazy that Coinbase would let this go on for so long.",

Is there a reason why every Mina withdrawal from coinbase pro to coinbase (internal withdrawal) gets Mina into pending limboland? Every other coin goes through perfectly fine. I wish I could either cancel the withdrawal and be able to trade this pending amount. It's now sitting there becoming worthless as time passes and the price of Mina is dropping. Also I would like to receive a NON-automated message on my case# 11238906 that you guys closed and claim to have solved the issue twice. Much appreciated.",

Coinbase can return the coins if given an address to do so, and if they wanted to.

Sometimes Coinbase asks for a fee (about $500) for their labor  \n\nSpecific instructions to give to Coinbase:  \nYour Coinbase account has this Bitcoin address for receiving a deposit *3JFoYMHKs86y2uVW3UsHjHrUUzn65meySF*  \nYou accidentally sent Litecoin from Binance to this Bitcoin address. Your Litecoin is now in a Coinbase Litecoin wallet at this Litecoin address *MQTwrEhHpExPqQmQ9MrdYw6sohNY3Zwn6x*  \nBoth of these addresses have the same private key  \nBut the private key only exists in Coinbase's Bitcoin wallet  \n\nCan Coinbase please export the private key for *3JFoYMHKs86y2uVW3UsHjHrUUzn65meySF* from Coinbase's Bitcoin wallet and import the key into Coinbase's Litecoin wallet, and then send the 18.57264206 Litecoin to your Coinbase account \n\nJust wondering if anyone with experience in this depth of field at coinbase can help me with what's been told to me by another reddit user.",

            "selftext": "I have CB account for 4 years. Recently I opened a CB debit card account. I used it extensively to take advantage of 4% crypto reward.\n\nRecently, CB deactivated debit card mentioning security violation. Since it is a debit card, they immediately showed 0 USD to my existing balance. Initially, I thought it will be okay when I will contact them and re-open the account.\n\nThats where the struggle began. No one could answer why my card was deactivated. They raised a case where you will only get one way email response. 2 days later, the email came saying due to policy violation they deactivated my card and it will remain that way. When I asked about my remaining balance on the card, they said it should be on the coinbase account. However, there are none. \n\nTo confirm I sold another $100 dollars of XLM. That money also vanished. It did not show anywhere on my account. After talking to multiple people countless times and thousand hours, I still do not have any access to my money. \n\nWhat should I do now?",

I get the prompt, I use my fingerprint to authenticate, and then the confirmation window appears.  I hit \"Confirm\" and then the fingerprint comes up again.  I use my fingerprint, and then the confirmation window appears.  This keeps happening and I have no way to get past it.  Does anyone have a solution??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother issue that appears is that I'll use the fingerprint to authenticate and the confirmation window appears.  Then I'm unable to hit \"Confirm\".

Note that I have more than enough in my account/wallet to cover this outstanding amount.  I\u2019ve had two other payments in this same time period go through without issue.\n\nI made the purchase order on 3/27, and my bank reversed the transaction w/Coinbase on 3/28, at which point I was outstanding and locked out of doing anything with my account.  I figured that at the very least, I could just wait the 5 business days, for Coinbase to automatically recover the outstanding amount by selling some of my crypto.  I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THEM DOING SO, IN FACT I WANT THIS TO HAPPEN IF IT WILL BRING ME BACK TO NO OUTSTANDING BALANCE AND ALLOWS ME TO RESUME TRADES AGAIN.  Today is 4/14.  If my ability to repay this myself is apparently not going to work, then WHY is it that automatic recovery has not taken place yet? It has been much more than 5 days and should have happened more than a WEEK ago now.  Can anyone help or provide any answers?  I have gotten no where with the many attempts I\u2019ve made going through the help center, and I\u2019m extremely frustrated by this still being an issue that has kept me locked out of my account. \nThank you\n\nCase number #11211911",

Also, it\u2019s a bit of a pain making sure the card is always loaded, trying to figure out big purchases above the $2.5k limit each day, etc. However, I\u2019ve found a solution that makes it all much easier. \n\nI have switched to paying almost everything on an Citi credit card. Why Citi? Well they allow you to pay your bill over their automated phone system with a debit card. I\u2019ve done this multiple times over the last few months, where I load up the Coinbase card a week or so in advance, then call a few days before my card due date to pay. If it\u2019s more than $2.5k, I just have to time it to make the payments over multiple days. This way, I can count the number of CB card transactions I have on one hand. Then I get about $100 in rewards for each payment of $2.5k. I convert it to BTC and ETH, and send it on its way to storage.\n\nNow I can spend as much as I want each day and only have to worry about the limits of the CB card. Also, I get cash back of around 2% from my Citi card AND 4% from CB. It\u2019s also a helpful way DCA each month. You still have to figure out the gains and losses, but with only a few large transactions, my gain/loss on them are incredibly small. And I have fewer transactions to calculate come tax day.",

Wise is a UK bank that gives me a US routing number and account number to use\n\n2) when I try to link my Wise GBP account at Coinbase (I figured I might as well do this), I have to transfer money *from* my Wise account to Coinbase set the account up. I then get an error message from Wise saying that I\u2019m not allowed to pay money to that recipient (Coinbase).\n\nI\u2019ve got queries in at both Coinbase and Wise to try to resolve this, but no one at Wise has heard of Coinbase and no one at coinbase has heard of Wise. So I\u2019m looking for someone who has actually does this, so that I can be in awe of and learn from them. Thanks!",

Please reach out ! This needs to stop .. at this point I\u2019m thinking coinbase just ignores you until you have given up so they can take ur money",

Too many requests for codes happening simultaneously. If you make too many requests (and that happens), the codes that have not arrived will be invalidated.\n2. Codes may take some time to arrive, up to 60 minutes. Here\u2019s what you need to do to get a valid 2-step verification code: Remain on the request page and do not request a new code for 60 minutes. When the code arrives, log in as normal. Or, you can try each of the codes texted to you as they arrive.",

I could never get back into account, so at their suggestion I opened a new account under another email address and they were to port everything over. So all I got was all the junk minimal amount of coins you are left with after making trades for 6 months. They didn't even port over my transaction history. When I requested that, all I got was the report showing the crap value of coins that they had pulled over. After multiple requests I finally got the full transaction history and see that on the same day that I got the unauthorized password notifications, one coin with significant value was turned in BTC and transferred to GDAX.  So even after telling me there were no transactions I see in the history that there were and all those coins are gone. I have yet to get a solid answer.

I couldn't connect my bank because I constantly was getting error messages, so I bought the 300 limit with my debit, and around 73 with paypal. I went to send all of my ethereum to my MetaMask wallet and it said I could only send the eth I bought in the first transaction. I checked my email and it said there was a cooldown until the 18th. This is an issue as the NFT I am poised to purchase is minting on the 15th. Without all of the funds in my MetaMask, I will be unable to get the NFT that I have been part of for 4 months. If there is a way to shorten this? I don't mind waiting 72 hours, I just can't miss this mint. Thanks for your time.",

Or it is just auto-replay.\n\n2) Not sure, should I replay them at the email, or there is some page where you can track your case via number you get and communicate with support there?

Tap  + Buy on the Home tab.\n2. Select the asset you\u2019d like to buy.\n3. Enter the amount of crypto you want to buy, then choose how often you\u2019d like to repeat this buy (from the drop-down menu) and your payment method.\n4. Tap Preview buy > Buy now.\n\nWeb browser:\n\n1. Click Buy / Sell.\n2. On the Buy tab, choose the asset you\u2019d like to purchase.\n3. Enter the amount of crypto you want to buy, then choose how often you\u2019d like to repeat this buy (from the drop-down menu) and your payment method.\n4. Click Preview buy > Buy now.Note that when you set up a recurring purchase, a one-time buy for the recurring purchase amount will execute immediately. For example, if you set up a recurring purchase for $50 worth of ETH each month, you will also execute a one-time buy of $50 ETH at that moment\n\nFor more info about recurring buy, please check this link: [https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/buying-selling-or-converting-crypto/how-can-i-create-or-cancel-a-recurring-transaction](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/buying-selling-or-converting-crypto/how-can-i-create-or-cancel-a-recurring-transaction)\n\nHope this helps!",

They are probably going to keep the BRD token functioning on the exchange it is presently at until the Ripple case is over. Coinbase has several things on the back-burner all hinging on the Ripple verdict including a lending exclusive platform and token (LEND, LNDR or something).",

While you are staking ETH2, you will be unable to trade, send, or sell the amount you have staked. Once the ETH2 network is live, your funds will become available to trade, send, or sell the staked amount released. You will be notified via email and on your Coinbase account when these features are available. \n\nFor more information, please visit this help article:  \n[https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/staking-rewards/eth-2-0-staking](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/staking-rewards/eth-2-0-staking)\n\nMany thanks for your patience and understanding!",

However, there are some things you can do, one is turn the card off in the app and no charges will get through.  In your case if the card is Not active, who knows how they did the fraud.  The other is have notifiations on for each charge.  When in store and make purchase or online, you get instant noticaation via text what store and amount charged.    I would not pay any credit monitoring.  I have used credit karma for years which is free and they send you an instant notification via email if any problems arise.",

This way, you dont need to give out your personal bank account. And I keep the card disabled all the time unless I AM making a purchase or sale. In case I get hacked and someone tries to purchase more, they can't because the card does not work unless they crack the 2FA on CashApp as well. This method works for me and I do not guarantee it will work for you. Hope this helps.",

Lately, we've been talking about setting up an account on Coinbase so that if and when the time comes that a client wants to send a payment to us with cryptocurrency, we have the ability to accept it. We're not trading, we're not custodians, we're not investors, we just want a simple way to receive payments as an option. Any payments would probably be immediately converted to fiat. It wouldn't be much volume, certainly not to start. MAYBE a handful of transactions a year. Coinbase Commerce seems like a good option but we're not really selling things and might not use it enough. I've also heard of people having issues with funds getting locked up. A simple business exchange account would probably work too and be easier. Are there any advantages with using Commerce or any other products that might work better?",

I also transferred some XLM to my Wallet to test it out. Everything works fine on my mobile device. So I installed Chrome (Safari User usually) downloaded the Coinbase Wallet extension, created a existing wallet,  entered my 12 Seed Phrase from the mobile device and evertything worked out. My address is showing correctly, I can receive coins etc. but neither my XLMs are showing up, nor my NFT. So I put up the same wallet on my MacBook, same problem. Nothing shows up, 0 $ Balance and \"You have no NFTs\", but they are both clearly visible on the mobile device.'  \nAm I just so stupid and overlook a simple mistake or happened this before? \n\nI need the wallet extension on chrome for payments and smaller stuff, can anybody help me?",

The reason I ask is for the 5-7 day holding for ACH deposits.",

Today, I try to deposit another $1k, and I get hit with a message stating that I had already reached my $250 ACH deposit limit?!\n\nWhy did this get arbitrarily lowered without any notice to me, the customer? I put in a support case to get it raised back up, but that's not an instant fix. Obscure account finagling is going to finally push me onto another exchange. I'd rather pay higher fees, than to be handcuffed.\n\nAnyone else experience this?",

A foreign international organization got into his CB Account, converted $3200 current value in various crypto coin assets into ADA and transferred the ADA values from a VISA Coinbase debit card issued in his name to their organization. A bigger loss of over 5K when the assets were sold during a crypto crash at 230 AM at greatly depreciated values. He had an activated Coinbase debit card but never once used it, nor lost or out of his personal possession. The thieves did numerous transaction attempts within minutes and withdrew multiple blocks of funds in smaller segments to the Debit Card up to the daily maximum of $2500. Coinbase is dragging their feet and slow to respond or take action after numerous calls and say resolution may take up to 90 days and may only be reimbursed up to $300 of losses! Their algorithms failed with repeated suspicious activity, approximately 50 transaction attempts within two hours on the debit card. With two factor authentication and a complicated password, how did they get access to his main CB account along with the information from his Debit card i.e Exp date, CVV code? Suspect the debit card was used as a backdoor to get into his main Coin Base Crypto account. Coinbase laid off many staff and may been an internal security breach to pull this off in retaliation? There is a clear timeline of transactions that show obvious fraud, but they will attempt to blame you and not take any liability. Caution, you may want to consider transferring your assets out of Coinbase and close your accounts? They have internal security issues and as a multi Billion dollar company with supposedly the tightest security, they really do not care about your losses and will do anything to refuse responsibility! Next step, Congressional case file with all the documentation, a formal SEC Complaint and love to join a mass class action lawsuit. Who knows if they will still be in business in 90 days time!",

Only were declined due to me not have funds in there. I have not even received the card via mail. So i look into this more. Seems to happen often with robinhood. Seemed to be some type of data breach in the past rh wont admit to....might be the same situation with coinbase? Although i have never had a problem with them. Just this recent rh problem i explained. Just thought i owed an explanation now that i understand how it can be compromised.  So maybe your card was compromised in a similar way. Again, different company. But just saying. Anyways, good luck.",

Their security team is not very proactive. The VISA payment system was also contacted to stop payment but were not able to do so and the bank behind the CB Debit card should have been able to stop the transactions.

You do not need 4 digit to buy anything with the card. It's just like a debit card. If you use it in a store when the machine asks for card number you can just hit enter and it will bypass it because your using visa to process the transaction. I use my cb card all the time I never type in my code. Someone cloned the card or they had copy of card. Does not sound like any talent involved with the theft on this one.",

It was dormant, safely secured within our home.\n\nWhy have a security department and charge the highest fees if you can't protect the consumer. Likely these debit card numbers and information were stolen from within the company and sold on the black market.\n\nResponses such as nothing we can do, contact the police are unacceptable.\n\nCongressional complaint, SEC, Consumer Protection Board, Federal Trade Commission, \n\nand Class Action Lawsuit.\n\nThe only people who should get negative KARMA is the organization who refuses to correct the error.

Anyway, it seems like the whole debacle or \u201ctrust\u201d around crypto is that it has some \u201cmacro\u201d backing of the US dollar. Like whenever you want, you should be able to cash in your chips on the coinbase app, and collect real money. It seems like the scary part this week was that some of these coins pegged to the US dollar are not actually backed by US dollars? I guess one of them had no backing other than code? Then the other one, tether, started getting shaky because ppl began to question if they had a dollar for every tether. The answer being \u201cno\u201d but they do short term loans?? On a more macro-level, as liquidity begins to dry up, for the first time since 2008, so too will the excess cash to back things like tether or the rest of the crypto economy. Like I said, crypto is the surplus sponge at the end of a decade-plus quantitative easing. Inflation and higher interest rates are wringing that sponge abs the liquidity is flowing back into the \u201creal\u201d economy. You can\u2019t pay for higher gas using polka dot coin lol.",

USDC is better but not entirely backed by fiat.\n\nAND what is the fiat USD back with? Not gold or silver; just the, say so, of the Federal Government, and banks. So is it really better than UST, USDT, USDC, or any of the \"Stablecoins\"? \n\nAnd in my opinion the Fiat USD is closer to UST/Luna than we want to believe. Every dollar you put in the bank it is loaned out 4 times. If there was an actual \"Bank Run\" in the US, there would not be enough USD to cover... heck I still see that there is a \"Coin Shortage\" after 2 years now.\n\nThe USD is only backed by FDIC right now.

The original cause of the incident was that the stablecoin UST was **de-peg 1 USD**. This leads to Terra\u2019s monetary policy being activated, which is activated to subsidize the UST\u2019s price back to $1.\n\nHowever, starting at 0:00 on May 8 when the UST price started to drop from $1 and fell to as low as $0.9857 on the same day due to the sudden withdrawal of UST on **Anchor** about more than 50% of the UST value at that time. and immediately they were sold off at 3pool on **Curve** and **Binance** with a large amount of UST leading to many investors panicking and selling off UST subsequently, causing the value of UST to plummet to $0.6x on May 10. \n\nRead more: [https://cryptowallcity.com/a-panoramic-view-of-terra-luna-and-ust/](https://cryptowallcity.com/a-panoramic-view-of-terra-luna-and-ust/)",

Do they all charge a fee to move coins off coinbase and charge fees to move it back? Which one is the least expensive, polygon?\n\nHow do I connect it to coinbase pro too? Can it be used for other exchanges like gemini and crypto com?\n\nI just wanted to invest in coins, not trade, just have the exchanges manage the keys but this talk of assets being forfeited is too much.

And that's the usual convention.\nI have just received an email that for that reason I cannot use this bank account for either iDEAL nor SEPA transfers because \"it cannot be verified or approved\" making it basically useless.\nWhat a disappointment. And I was hoping this could be my binance alternative, since they stopped supporting payments from Dutch accounts. I hope I can get the money back soon, at least. \nAny suggestions what service to use instead?",

It told me to verify my SSN. I put in everything it required such as name, address, and SSN. Everything correct, shouldn\u2019t be hard to mess it up right? Then it said it couldn\u2019t verify it. It\u2019s my same name and address I don\u2019t get what it can\u2019t verify. Then I contact support and they only give me the same message as the error saying make sure everything is put in correctly. When it is.\n\n   Support was no help at all so I don\u2019t know where to go from here. I\u2019m wondering if anyone had a similar problem. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",

Thought this would be a case of them going into the address on there end and transferring me the coins but nope wouldn't do it. \n\nSo there I am down bad so I turned to my bank and explained the situation to them of what occurred. After about a month of my bank investigating they've ruled with me and now issued a chargeback to visa for \u00a31500 so thankfully in the next few weeks I'll be receiving a chargeback. \n\nFinally some good news after a 2 month fuck around. I'm aware coinbase will 100% try to close my account and to them I say do it. You've fucked your users the past week due to the crash of crypto not allowing them to withdraw or  cutting how much they can buy, sell, trace etc and I don't wanna be apart of company that robs its users.",

On December 14th, Coinbase website login page was taken over by the hacker group, who intercepted login requests, denied access to Coinbase accounts, and posted fraudulent messages directing Coinbase customers to call their fake support line. They  provided fake Coinbase software engineer credentials and ran away without millions of dollars. Coinbase has denied any responsibly, so I'm looking for other individuals who were victims to band together and get our hard earned money back. \n\nIf you or someone you know was a victim of this crime. Please contact [beejall@gmail.com](mailto:beejall@gmail.com) \n\nLooking forward to being in touch. \n\nB",

I know this not only because by 11am PST Coinbase had put up a temporary splash page with a human verification image test, something they don't normally do, telling that they found the security breach and installed an added security measure, until their devs fixed the situation. \n\nJust because the Coinbase or Coinbase Pro exchange wasn't hacked doesn't mean Coinbase Global isn't responsible for properly securing their web portal. They should own up to the security breach and not try to sweep it under the rug and pretend like it never happened.",

Upon completion of this process, though, the web page opens to a notification that my account is being forcibly closed, and that I need to move my funds out of it.\n\n>Unfortunately we have to close your Coinbase account. Before your account can be closed, you\u2019ll need to withdraw your crypto funds to an external wallet and your cash funds to a bank account associated with your Coinbase account. If you are currently enrolled in USD Coin rewards, you may want to wait up to 40 days before withdrawing funds to ensure you have received all eligible reward payouts. You will not be able to access these funds after account closure. Please take precautions when transferring cryptocurrency to an external wallet as transfers outside of Coinbase are irreversible. Please also be sure to delete any external references to cryptocurrency addresses generated by Coinbase, as funds sent to those addresses will not be accessible once the account is closed. If you have any questions you may visit [https://support.coinbase.com](https://support.coinbase.com/).\n\nWhen I called customer service, they were unable to give me a reason other than \"I broke the user terms of service.\" They were unable to site which terms I violated, or how I could fix the issue. The agent I spoke to then sent me an email:\n\n>Hi \\[NAME REDACTED\\],  \n>  \n>Thanks for contacting us.  \n>  \n>We regret to inform you that we can no longer support your Coinbase account.  \n>  \n>As a regulated Money Services Business under FinCEN, our primary goal is to make our platform safe and secure for our customers. A variety of factors have been weighed in your case, and for security reasons we are unable to elaborate on our internal decision process.  \n>  \n>While we can no longer continue our banking relationship, we have not blocked your access to the current balance in your Coinbase account. You may still send your balance offsite to an external address.  \n>  \n>Please know that we do not make these decisions lightly and we regret losing you as a customer.  \n>  \n>Regards,Coinbase Support\ud83d\udcf7\n\nHas anyone else had an issue with this? What steps should I take to try to get further information? Technically speaking, they are allowed to close any account for any reason, and don't need to disclose it, but this seems like terrible business practice.\n\nThank you in advance for any input.\n\nEDIT: And I am not actually able to transfer my funds. When I made an account with a different crypto exchange and tried to transfer, it gives a red error message.\n\n>You are currently unable to send Bitcoin. Please contact support.\n\n&#x200B;",

After understanding that I was not going to get access to my account again, I decided to send back my money to my bank account. I made a first transfer of 150.000 EUR, everything went fine. I made another two transfers of 250.000 EUR the 27th and 29th of march but due to internal policies changes of my bank, they decided to do not accept more money from Coinbase. My bank sent back the 2 transfers to Coinbase and Coinbase is not accepting the money back so my money is jumping from the Coinbase bank in Estonia to my bank in Spain. My bank can not help at the moment and I just need Coinbase to send my money to a new bank entity. I send plenty of emails and made plenty of calls but is impossible to get an answer or solve this issue. I need some help please, I am completely desperate about this situation.

WARNING your eth will be locked up until ETH2 is released. You will not be able to sell or move it till ETH2 is available. As a bonus you will receive $10 for every $100 of ETH you move over in ETH\n\nSo if you lock up ya eth to eth2 ya get the 5% steak. Plus the bonus of additional ETH $10 worth of eth per $100. Sounded like a good deal to me, since I am gonna sit on this eth long term anyway, plus I get additional free eth. Hit accept and the next window said I am now steaking my ETH. And to be on the lookout for the Email to claim my bonus ETH. That was 1 week ago. I have called Coinbase and askes them wtf, each time they say they have no clue what I am talking about. They say a supervisor will contact me, but none can talk on the phone must be in email. Yet Never do they contact me back\n\nHas anyone got this msg steaked their eth and got a bonus of $10 of eth for every $100 of eth you moved into ETH2. I am about to buy more of a frieds account and record it so I can get video evidence of exactly this option for the bonus eth, because Coinbase keeps saying this does not exist. Yet the dang app gave me that option, and even said to look out for the email to claim my bonus. YET NO email no info on line nothing at all about it\n\nAnyone had this happen to them, or have any information that can help me?",

These are tulip bulb manias and if Coinbase is going to scoop up a position in an extremely thinly traded altcoin, bring them in for others to buy, rake transactions, slush pools to be the buyer and seller of last resort, then rotate out the tulip bulb manias after they burst, then Coinbase will be participating in the securities law definition of pumping and dumping to create tulip bulb manias to profit by the surge.  It's a fountain of free money for them.\n\nI think that's what the feds want too.  To De-legitimize coinbase to break their spirit.  If coinbase is going to stand strong, they need to not drop WLUNA just because the price goes way down due to an error in wluna balancing between US dollars.\n\nI don't really have faith that Coinbase is going to do the right thing, and so their punishment is going to be they're not going to see five six or seven digits worth of financial trust from me, rather they'll have to be content with the sum of money that I'm willing to flush on a game of roulette at the casino.  Coinbase is adopting new thinly traded altcoins so fast that all of them are going down on average.  They're being too greedy.  These cryptocurrencies aren't worth anything, or more specifically they're worth how much stupidity they can command from gullible investers sold on moonshine.\n\ncoinbase having their best quarters yet notwithstanding, they're just admitting they're raking money out of the ecosystem of tulip bulb manias they're helping legitimize.  If a lawyer could clarify my thoughts, they could probably put a spin on the Truth-Ceremony at the swamp houses that the dropping of WLUNA is a financial crime.  Something the wall street exchanges are confined around, needing more religious Ceremony around de-listing.",

I waited a day or two after getting the error and then tried again and was able to get in, watch the video/slides, take the quiz and was granted the crypto, so I just figured it was a bug. That happened I think three times. Then past Earns (or whatever you want to call them) started disappearing from my history bringing my total earned amount down. Not that the total matters, I'm just not sure what details could be relevant to any issue here. Slowly, more started disappearing. No new Earns were popping up. There were only two cryptos left in my Earn history, then one, then zero. Then the Earn box disappeared from my dashboard. I haven't gotten another one since the beginning of February. Earn is still in the options on the side menu, but the only thing on that page is the offer to earn $10 in btc for setting up a recurring buy of $50+.\n\nIt's not a big deal or anything, but $3 or $4 worth of new crypto here and there was neat and kinda fun. Has anyone had this happen? Is Earn being phased out or do I need to so something with my account? How do I figure out if my ID verification needs to be updated?",
