Basically all an NFT is a pointer to an image location. In theory you can do a lower tech version of it. If the chain of transaction codes can be traced back across the blockchain to an original creator of the thing, then it's a similar effect.   \n\n\nTechnically however, it's not a token. So maybe calling it an NFT is not quite accurate.",
