Best thing is, \"rewards\" aren't taxable events. You only pay tax on the gains made after getting the reward.\n\nYou can choose whichever crypto you want for the reward as long as it's on Gemini, you can switch it whenever you want to another coin. I'm going with Doge rather than Bitcoin for now. I believe they go directly to your account immediately after your purchases, either that or after each statement. It's also nice that the card number is not on the card, you can only get it digitally.\n\nIt's hella thick metal, can barely bend it. You can choose black, silver, or rose gold for the color.",

Debit cards don\u2019t.\n\nBut both charge the merchants fees, which range depending on the volume they put through.\n\nPart of these fees are paid to banks and the networks which facilitate transactions. And it\u2019s quite complicated, with fees flowing in multiple directions throughout the network.\n\nCard issuers end up with a piece of the pie. And some choose to offer rebates to customers to use them rather than a competitor.\n\nSo, if this is how your rebates arrive, all well and good.\n\nBut, this is crypto. And we know that so-called \u2018staking\u2019 income actually comes from unsecured lending to people who use the coins to short the currency and drive prices down. And, according to /u/liquid_at, some exchanges have it in their fine print that they can do this without additional permissions.\n\nIf that\u2019s the funding model for this card, then run away, very very fast.",
