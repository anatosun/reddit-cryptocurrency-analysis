            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI learned about CoinBase when someone tried to create an account with my throwaway email. I got the verification email, but it wasn't open, which made me think they may have failed to create an account at all. Still, I emailed CoinBase using their contact form on the website regarding this issue. I asked them if anyone had successfully created the account and if so what kind information had been input so I could know if I needed to look into any of my bank accounts, for example. I also asked them to close the account if it had been made. I attempted to call them as well, but because I didn't know if they had made an account with my email and what phone number would be connected to it, I couldn't speak to a human. The machine just hung up on me.\n\nI got an email back a week ago that I just saw. It was mislabeled (it said Hello Jhon despite that definitely not being my name, not even close) and said that IF an account exists with my name it will be closed. It gave me a list of things to contact (bank, law enforcement) and said, \"We will not be able to provide any additional information through our support emails.\" A few days later they closed the case.\n\nI feel like I don't have any answers and I don't know what to do or who to speak to. They've pretty much said they won't tell me anything over email and I don't know how to get someone on the phone. I don't even know if someone managed to open an account with my email or not. I can't imagine contacting law enforcement saying, \"Well, someone may or may not have stolen my email, but I don't know how to tell if they were successful.\" The email address itself doesn't seem to be compromised.\n\nDoes anyone here have any suggestions on how to speak to CoinBase and determine if someone had created an unauthorized account with my email? I want to do my due diligence but I need more information to do so.",

You may have requested this, or we might have done it automatically. Please submit a support ticket at https://help.coinbase.com/en/contact-us\"\n\nThis highly suggests that they did create the account, but doesn't tell me what information they had connected to it, such as bank information. The name is, again, nothing close to my real name. I did request they close the unauthorized account, so I know that was me.\n\nWhat's the next step? For all I know they tried to create the account but couldn't verify it and so didn't connect it to anything. The name used as the account name doesn't match my legal name.",
