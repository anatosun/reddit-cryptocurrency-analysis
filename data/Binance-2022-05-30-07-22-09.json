Other ways you can take action in the US:\n\n\\- File a report with the Federal Trade Commission on their website.\n\n\\- File a complaint with your state Attorney General's office. Most states allow you to file a complaint on their website.\n\n\\- Contact a consumer protection or fraud attorney who may take your case on contingency (at no cost to you)\n\n\\- Read the terms of use carefully and file an arbitration claim online with the American Arbitration Association.

If not claimed by binance with in a week, it normally gets back on your credit card account. \nDid you use the right reference as stated?\n\nWe realy need more details to be able to help. And support probably Same. \n\nMaybe they cant help because they never received anything, and the problem is with you or your bank. \n\nAnd about support. Indeed. I love binance as a tool and as an exchange. But support is sh**.\nI get the impression, users know binance better then support does.\nWhen asking a question, i have to rephrase everything multiple times.

I\u2019ve sent them evidence to back up the wallets were binance wallets but still binance.com won\u2019t take notice unless police fill form out, I\u2019m told by action fraud and police that unless I get a contact number for binance they will not complete form and bianace won\u2019t take me seriously even though I\u2019ve given them police, Action fraud and FCA crime Reference numbers. \n\nI would like to take this to the press and investigating teams, I\u2019m looking for anyone who had similar problems with bianace and might want to help join this fight.  With companies like bianace aware there site is being use for scams but because of the gray area covering Cypto, they seem to be able to turn a blind eye, why other out there are getting scammed. \nWE MUST TRY TO FIGHT AND PUT A STOP TO THIS.\nThe more voices the more people and companies will take note.\nPlease message me if you had similar problem, I\u2019m working closely with a solicitor firm called Proelium Law.",

Therefore, if you want to challenge them in court you would need to address the issue of whether it is legal to force arbitration in a contract of adhesion. The answer to that depends on the jurisdiction and we are back to figuring out where they are actually based.\n\nPractically speaking, you could just bring a case against whatever name/address you can find and then if it turns out to not be the \"Binance Operator\" (most likely), hope that the judge forces them to disclose who the actual counter party to your contract is.\n\nAnyway, its a really interesting legal issue in international law and one that doesn't seem to have been explored much (ie where a party refuses to disclose who they are in order to practically avoid ever being sued). Probably deserves a phd or at least a journal article",

Without the 2FA it won't let me move on. I have filled out their support tickets and recieved an automated email telling me they can help manually, so I did everything I was asked and nothing. No acknowledgement on whether they have recieved anthing from me or how long it will take. I get crypto is big right now and Binance thinks it doesn't matter if they lose a customer or two, but eventually the bad customer service always catches up especially in down times. I also know if any member of the Binance team reads this they may not care a whole lot because I mean after all they don't own the company, but one day there may not be a company to own or a job to go to. Is it always like this?",

Three weeks later after countless hours of dealing with the most inept customer service setup I have ever dealt with, I am granted access to my account and surprise! I'm a US resident so I have no choice but to sign into Binance US. I register there expecting to find my holdings. Nothing. Now Binance US is 10x worse than Binance (or at least I thought). No response whatsoever to chat tickets or email. Now I'm back to Binance figuring they should have my holdings and need to transfer them to Binance US. This time however I am getting nowhere with Binance aside from two emails that basically ask me if I still need help, totally ignoring the issue which I clearly spelled out in my original email to them. Not sure what recourse I have but this is borderline thievery. Where is the accountability? They're messing with people's money and that's not cool. I'd like to find a class action if there is one. \n\nRead this article and it may give an inside look as to why these crypto companies have placed such a low emphasis on customer service:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/04/14/coinbases-first-employee-cold-emailed-founders-was-paid-in-bitcoin.html",

Possibly it got lost when I upgraded my phone, but since I don't track crypto day to day, I don't get in there a lot. They gave me the automated reply that they could reinstate manually. I just needed to send them a photo with the same ID I used to sign up (along with a few other things). Well, I signed up with my driver's license, which since then expired and has been replaced! So I sent what I had. No reply. Later, I at least found a photo I had taken of my older driver's license, so I resent everything including that\u2014although I clearly couldn't do the requested video of me holding the actual ID.
