            "selftext": "From a newbie tiptoeing into crypto...\n\nI've opened a Coinbase account recently and only purchased $110 USDC by linking to my checking account. Also got a debit card funded with some dollar and did 2 transactions to test cashback (4% with XLM). So effectively I have only four assets:\n\n* 110 USDC\n* $17.62 US dollar\n* tiny number of bitcoin (new sign up bonus),\n* tiny number of XLM (from the cashback)\n\nThe amount $17.62 showing inside the Assets screen always equals to the available fund for the debit card.\n\nAbout 1 hour ago I transferred 110 USDC to my other account in BlockFi. The gas price is about $2, so effectively 108 USDC in BlockFi, and 0 USDC in Coinbase.\n\nShortly after that, I noticed the available funds for the debit card was reduced by about 3 dollars to $14.51. However, the Assets screen still correctly shows $17.62 dollar. If I refresh the debit card screen, the available fund itself also fluctuate, but only changed one cent each time ($14.51 => $14.52 => $14.53 => $14.52).\n\nIs the above expected? Is it a bit frightening that a finance company cannot keep the US dollar amount correct? I understand the cryptos fluctuates all the time 24X7, but US dollar should stay without any transaction.",

A few minutes after I made the post, this user ([https://www.reddit.com/user/COINBASE\\_SUPPORT789](https://www.reddit.com/user/COINBASE_SUPPORT789)) requested a DM with me, and directed me to a Live chat link pointed to [https://tawk.to](https://tawk.to).
