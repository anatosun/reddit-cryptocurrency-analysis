Running around in circles while yelling \"To the Moon\" no longer attracts viewers.\n\nOn the other hand, the small number of Influencers who always had an intelligent message, thoughtful analysis, and realistic view of crypto's inherent risks are still active.  This small cadre will survive the current downturn and become even bigger stars when crypto roars back a few months (year?) down the road.",
