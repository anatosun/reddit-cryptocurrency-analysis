            "selftext": "So I've been trying to sell my dogecoin and convert it to USD, however I am unable to sell it. My money is stuck in dogecoin, so I decided to call customer service. They told me, they're not sure so they will email me and update me. I recieved an email which stated the reason I called. Included in the email: if I don't recieve a response within 6 days, I should reply back. I heard nothing, and responded saying it still wasn't working. They responded with a generic email giving me troubleshooting methods, most of which I've tried. I already told them the various troubleshooting I tried. So I called them tonight, and they just had me troubleshoot the same things over and over again. I hit my verification limit for 24 hours. So after wasting this time the issue wasn't solved. They told me, that now I'm  going to have to wait another 24 hours for anything to be done ( its already been 8 days) When I told them this, and asked if I could speak to a manager after being told that I should get and email and just to respond to that email (again) they told me I could not speak to a manager. It ended with them hanging up and me, and my money still stuck in coinbase. Screw Coinbase. \n\nPs: I read other posts of people having this exact issue. I haven't seen any resolve.\n\nEdit: I forgot that the customer service person put me on hold for 5 minutes without notifying me. They also were playing games by suddenly placing me on hold and then coming back. Also edit for spelling.",

YSK this sub is mostly used by bad actors to try and con crypto newcomers, as is ConBase itself IMO. \n\nGood luck getting your issue resolved, but don't hold your breath for ConBase to help in any way whatsoever. I would start looking into other methods to find restitution; ConBase loves their legalese, but it's mostly just a deterrent. They contravene their TOS constantly, so customer legal complaints tend to hold water and are actually dealt with favorably to the user. That's just my 2\u00a2 though. \n\nGood luck OP.",

So it seems legit.\n\nThe email said the account will be frozen by May 31st if I don't upload documents verifying that this does not apply to me (I live in the EU) to this service: https://coinbase.sendsafely.com/dropzone/cx-files/xxxx\n\nIt seems this link is also legit (according to official reddit coinbase support, I found similar links here on reddit asking that and support confirms it is ok; there were also some redditors asking on twitter and it was confirmed as well). There are some older reddit posts with users having mixed responses though.\n\nIt also says on official website that coinbase use sendsafely to receive documents from users (https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/managing-my-account/update-my-account/additional-information-verification)\n\nSo overall, it seems like an legit email. To my inquiry I also received an email from security@coinbase.com saying that it was legitimate email.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAfter I uploaded the documents I received an email on May 17th telling me the access to my account was restored.\n\nBut today (May 24th) my account was deleted because of terms violations (i only withdrew remaining couple of Euros from my account because the email asked me).\n\nIt seems to me unlikely that it is a scam since an email and links were legit (I surely hope so), as well as other reddit discussions (see link in the beginning) but rather a mistake from coinbase.\n\nPlease help with the advice. I can't reach coinbase by phone (because account deletion) so I sent them email but they have not respond yet.\n\nAny response from r/coinbasesupport or r/coinbasesecurity will be appreciated.\n\n\n\nthank you",
