I wanted to know if using a grid trading bot or infinity grid trading bot for the full amount of one BTC(currently 29,400) is a good idea to gain some passive income?\n\nIf there are better ways please let me know.

This would be temporary and it would cause them to waste a fortune on electricity because they wouldn't even receive the block reward or transaction fees.

It also allows the malicious agents to essentially rewrite parts of the blockchain and reverse their own transactions, leading to an issue known as double spending. This problem was traditionally an issue faced mostly by electronic payments where a network was incapable of proving that two or more people didn\u2019t spend the same digital asset.\n\n\nA 51% attack, however, is theoretically limited in the amount of disruption it can cause. While the attacker could trigger the double-spending problem, they cannot reverse others\u2019 transactions on the network or prevent users from broadcasting their transactions to the network. Additionally, a 51% attack is incapable of creating new assets, stealing assets from unrelated parties or altering the functionality of block rewards.",

Some nodes get one block. Some nodes get the other block. This is a temporary chain tip fork. The fork is resolved when the next block arrives. The nodes on the shorter chain will reorg their chain tips to follow the longer chain  \n\nA 51% attack exploits this \"follow the longer chain\" rule by forging a tied mining race. The attacker's chain is longer, therefore it is the correct chain  \n\n---\n\nHere is a good writeup of the second Bitcoin Gold 51% attack  \nhttps://gist.github.com/metalicjames/71321570a105940529e709651d0a9765  \n\nBTG is GPU mined and has a low hash rate. This means that a miner can pay GPU owners on a hash broking market like NiceHash to turn their GPUs to mining BTG  \n\nThe cost of renting enough hash power to 51% attack BTG was about $900 per hour. The attackers rented hashes for 2 hours and secretly mined 2 hours of blocks. During this time they spent BTG to buy BTC on a coin-to-coin exchange. These BTG transactions are in the regular miners' blocks. The exchange sent the BTC  \n\nIn their shadow blocks, the attackers sent their BTG coins to themselves instead of to the exchange  \n\nAfter 2 hours, the attackers released their chain to the BTG node network. Their chain was longer so it replaced those 2 hours of blocks  \n\nNow the attackers have kept their BTG and received the BTC they purchased. The double-spend was accomplished by spending BTG to themselves, after the exchange had sent the purchased BTC",
