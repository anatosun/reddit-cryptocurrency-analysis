What most people don't realize though or seem to downright ignore is that the PoS chain isn't Polygon's end goal. It's a multi-faced suite of Ethereum scaling solutions.\n\nI am posting this because I love Ethereum and I think it's unfair to condemn how effectively Polygon is aiming to scale Ethereum simply because \"the price doesn't move\". It's quite frankly frustrating and I don't understand it. Unless there's other reasons I am not aware of that is, then I'd be more than happy to be educated on the matter.\n\nI truly feel like we are still early and as a whole, this web3 thing is a long-term game and a long-term investment. I also feel like if everything goes well then Polygon will be making the most progress as far as scaling Ethereum and moving web3 is concerned. What other team is dropping 4+ ZK solutions and what other team is going to be allowing USDC payments on twitter via stripe? I think these are massive steps forward and I don't understand why Polygon goes ignored, is hated on and is so under-valued. I'm hoping someone could give me some insight.",

We like the team, Sandeep and Jaynti in particular are regularly interviewed in Ethereum podcasts/panels/conferences etc. They are clearly well respected members of the ecosystem.\n\nWhat we don't like is the relentless shilling by MATIC bagholders, it's just as bad as what comes from LoopRing fans.\n\nWhile it's great that Polygon are working on rollups, there are plenty of other teams doing so already, and many of us are already using L2s like Arbitrum, zkSync, Optimism etc.\n\nWhenever someone mentions L1 fees are high or that we need more scaling, you can guarantee that there will be comments saying 'Polygon solves this' or whatever. The fact is that other projects solve this already, and Polygon is working on trying to solve it in the future.\n\nIf there was no MATIC token then there would be no annoying shills and I'm sure Polygon would be even more warmly regarded by Ethereum community.\n\nIf Polygon fans would acknowledge that there are other rollups much further along in development then your comments wouldn't be so misleading and might be better received.\n\nI know I've tried to explain this to you before, but I do really want to help you understand.

That processor relies on physical processes to perform operations such as addition and subtraction, and it's constrained by real world physics. It turns out though that with complex-enough circuitry, you can create a processor that is able to simulate its own operation in an abstract way. That is to say, you can create a piece of software that outputs the same output as a physical processor would for the same real world input. So like you feed a signal to a physical processor and it outputs another signal (which for example a screen could interpret as a blue pixel somewhere). Alternatively, you can create a program in the memory which accurately describe the very same rules that the physical processor has, so if you feed the same input to that program, that program outputs the same output as the real processor would.\n\nHow this connects to the EVM is that you don't necessarily need to describe the very same rules of the physical processor, you can make any kind of modifications or new rules. The EVM is a Virtual Machine (a virtual processor) that has its own custom rules that Ethereum needs to execute the special type of software that is written on it. The blockchain is the memory of this virtual processor, like the RAM is the memory for a physical processor.",

It executes a standardized bytecode, that is a computer program translated into a language for this specific processor. The EVM opcodes are what you can \"do\" on the blockchain - like storing values or sending ETH to another account. That way, the block chain behaves like a gigantic \"world computer\". The block producers simulate it by executing all smart contract instructions according to the specification. For the user this looks like as if there was one single computer instead of this huge peer-to-peer network. Also this ensures interoperability. No matter what computer gets to execute the smart contract, the results will be the same.\n\nIt is a bit like the artificial language \"Esperanto\" that was designed as a common \"world language\". You translate your text to Esperanto (or take English as the more common example) and then anybody who can translate Esperanto to his or her native language can use the text.",

Inflation doesn't matter. But how would you keep up with user engagement over time with currency? Wouldn't you run out eventually? \n\nAny thoughts on this?",
