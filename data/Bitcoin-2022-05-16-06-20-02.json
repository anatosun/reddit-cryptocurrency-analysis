Ideally, it allows us to compress the number of transactions required on-chain, but there is presumably a theoretical limit to this right?  At the end of the day, if there are 1 million users that would like to settle, that is an absolute minimum of 1 million transactions sent to the chain, even if this cuts down from 10 or 100 million transactions this starts to look worrisome.  What happens when we have 50 million people using lightning, all who would like to settle once per month, its mathematically impossible, isn't it?  I know layer 1 isn't supposed to be daily transactions, but will normal people EVER be able to afford to settle or perform on chain transactions?  Will this mean that lightning will be the only form of bitcoin many will ever see?  Really, if opening a channel requires an on-chain action (from what I understand it does), will that make it impossible for normal people to even open a payment channel?  Will we all be at the mercy of trust based bitcoin bankers, transacting on layer 3?\n\nEdit\\* and to be clear, I love bitcoin, I just practice adversarial thinking.",

There are also potential solutions to channel creation in the pipeline (like channel factories) that could mitigate the issue.\n\nIf hyperbitcoininisation comes to pass then the base layer will become fiscally impractical for the every day user to interact with (but critically, not impossible at all). It may be that only big companies end up settling on chain. And maybe that is ok! Buying and using sats on the lightning network is the same as buying and selling bitcoin.\n\nWho knows what L3 on top of lightning might look like. It is possible that in the distant future it's the principal way to handle bitcoin, but there is nothing to suggest you will be at the mercy of a bitcoin bank any more than L2 makes you at the mercy of one imo.\n\nHell, as robust as lightning is, it may be that someone comes up with something even better and everyone jumps ship for that.",
