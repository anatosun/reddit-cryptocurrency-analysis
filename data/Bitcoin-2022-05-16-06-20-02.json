Is there correlation between BTC and tulips? Yes there is. \n\nWhy is the internet analogy valid, but you throw away the opinion of anyone who disagrees? \n\nJust because two incidents just so happens to have some common traits doesn\u2019t mean that these traits are the sole causation. Bitcoin might become sucsessfull, who am I to say otherwise, but no matter what, I can assure you it\u2019s not because people doubted. It\u2019s because people started to believe, and as of now that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. We simply have no idea if people want to start adopting BTC, and hence investing in it can only be speculative.\n\nBut hey, you\u2019ve got it figured out no?",

According to the [specs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), it can be any string of UTF8 characters. The passphrase is simply used as a salt in the hashing function, which means it can be as long as you want it to be.\n\nSo your passphrase could be \"1234\", the full collected works of Shakespeare, an unintelligible sequence of random characters and glyphs from various non-Latin alphabets, or any combination of these.\n\nThe actual restrictions on what you can use will be dictated by the device or application you use as a wallet. A software wallet on a computer will probably allow you more flexibility in what you can enter. But even then there may be limits on length and (possibly) character set. A hardware wallet, with a very minimal interface will probably not let you enter anything much more exotic than simple alphanumeric passphrases.",

If your passphrase is compromised, it's all good, the seed is impossible to guess but if someone gets your seed, the passphrase is as secure as a password to a website. It's often less than you think.\n\nSo as long as you concede that the seed is still the most important part, it shouldn't be considered safe because of the passphrase, then you can treat the passphrase as a time delay protection. An attacker *will* break into your wallet, but the passphrase dictates how long it would take.\n\nAs long as you get all of that, then you understand that the passphrase gives you the ability to empty the wallet before anyone else as long as you have a way to know when the seed has been compromised.\n\nIf you will monitor the seed yearly,  you need a very secure password. Song lyrics is not a great idea as that will probably be in a hackers dictionary attack tool (including variations)\n\nIf you will monitor it weekly, it might be good enough as long as you take concerns seriously.\n\nI like seed XOR btw. It gives you 2 parts that are both hard as fuck to guess making it pretty versatile. Call Paula",

Ideally, it allows us to compress the number of transactions required on-chain, but there is presumably a theoretical limit to this right?  At the end of the day, if there are 1 million users that would like to settle, that is an absolute minimum of 1 million transactions sent to the chain, even if this cuts down from 10 or 100 million transactions this starts to look worrisome.  What happens when we have 50 million people using lightning, all who would like to settle once per month, its mathematically impossible, isn't it?  I know layer 1 isn't supposed to be daily transactions, but will normal people EVER be able to afford to settle or perform on chain transactions?  Will this mean that lightning will be the only form of bitcoin many will ever see?  Really, if opening a channel requires an on-chain action (from what I understand it does), will that make it impossible for normal people to even open a payment channel?  Will we all be at the mercy of trust based bitcoin bankers, transacting on layer 3?\n\nEdit\\* and to be clear, I love bitcoin, I just practice adversarial thinking.",

It may be that only big companies end up settling on chain. And maybe that is ok! Buying and using sats on the lightning network is the same as buying and selling bitcoin.\n\nWho knows what L3 on top of lightning might look like. It is possible that in the distant future it's the principal way to handle bitcoin, but there is nothing to suggest you will be at the mercy of a bitcoin bank any more than L2 makes you at the mercy of one imo.\n\nHell, as robust as lightning is, it may be that someone comes up with something even better and everyone jumps ship for that.",

By L3 I mean in the sense Saylor describes it, trust based exchanges; by this I mean we would only be able to afford trading on platforms relying on trust, and my reasoning is that opening a channel alone could become difficult, hopefully we will see some solutions like these channel factories.  Not needing to settle every month is one thing, but looking out over the horizon the basic math says it could take years to settle transactions if we have a billion users; now I can try to amend my thinking to say maybe the average person doesn't need to settle, but I'll need to think on that one.",

He knows enough about how bitcoin works, but he doesn't like how it works. He mentions the fact that it uses the energy of a small country to secure the network, but just gives his opinion that it's not worth it (needs to be green). Then he goes on about how it's not equal, and it costs money to transact, and people use it for drugs, etc. etc. etc. The whole thing is just some guys rant with nothing special added to it. I was excited maybe to hear some new angle of attack on bitcoin, but this article was pretty amateur. All I know now is that this guy doesn't like the way bitcoin is designed and believes it's one of the great horrors of technology that has risen from the depths of the internet.\n\n**EDIT**: I wanted to add how stupid I think this article is. Nothing in the interview was actually interesting or even presented in an interesting manner. It reads like some freshman college paper. I'm surprised this person has a job writing professionally.",
