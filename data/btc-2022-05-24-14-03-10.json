I was following his work on the new transaction format, PMv3, but it's awesome he had found a better way to achieve the same thing!\n\nWith PMv3 smart contracts would have to manage large merkle trees to keep track of the owners but with the v2 you can just issue a native token!\n\nUnfortunate that Bitcoin Hivemind never got deployed due to the lack of protocol upgrades on BTC enabling sidechain technology. With covenants made possible through BCHs network upgrade, those technical hurdles are gone!\n\nAnyways I'm very glad Jason Dreyzehner was inspired by the work of Paul Sztorc",
