Thus the holders profit from you shorting, this again is unlike GME where the brokers profit from loaning the shares, not the holders. Even a paper contract has to be matched for it to be open. You can't just dump paper shares without paper buyers.   \n\n\nA viable project will never fall below a certain price threshold because someone will always buy it below x$. The price can be maintained low with selling pressure, but the reality is that you won't see a squeeze like with GME if buying pressure increases because shorts can all close.",

This platform allows better price discovery because it uses liquidity pools instead of order books. You can't spoof the order books or flood the market with borrowed BCH. \n\nIf more buying takes place on ThorChain the exchange price diverges from CEXs and Arbitrage bots buy up cheaper BCH on CEXs to transfer out to services like ThorSwap. Exchanges that don't allow withdrawals will not be used as much and over time more accurate price can be found.\n\nFurthermore, ThorChain allows LP providers to earn a return for providing liquidity, this mechanism pulls liquidity away from lending services that can lend out BCH to short. Note, this is not without risk, so understand completely what providing liquidity entails. ThorChain is releasing something called Synths which will abstract away the complexity of LP and give people a simple way to earn yield.",

According to my observation the answer is very likely yes.\n\nThere is a crypto sectior on plus500 future exchange platform, someone interested in this issue could try paying attention on how the percentage of buyer and seller moves on BCH compare to different cryptos over time. I have noticed some interesting things in the recent 6 month compare to last year, in short I do think it takes someone more effort to pin down the price of BCH than other coins(of which if effort is needed at all).
