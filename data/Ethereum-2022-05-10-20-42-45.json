It was just in committee and passed unanimously with ZERO no votes. Looks like this might pave the way for other states and maybe the feds to finally crack down on these crypto scams.\n\nLooks like it has one more committee to go through and then they'll do a full vote on it. After that the NY senate will have to pass it as well.\n\nHere's the bill if y'all wanna take a look at it: [https://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default\\_fld=&leg\\_video=&bn=A09029&term=0&Summary=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y](https://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A09029&term=0&Summary=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y)",

(Mnuchin is one who helped dissolve/destroy sears piece by piece and fuck workers out of their pensions). If you want to not have the whales and Elon Musk's manipulate and squeeze the average crypto user for all they can then you better hope someone like Elizabeth Warren (who wrote Dodd Frank) or Janet Yellen is writing the regulations. Going from minimal regulations to some regulations will be a pain point for some crypto users but is inevitable with wider adoption. Well thought out  regulation by the government can be a boon to crypto as people may develop a greater level of trust with the crypto marketplace if there can be legal consequences for financial abuses that occur within crypto. \n\nTo your point in the post title, if crypto has strong enough self regulation the government may not see the need to regulate it as much. The government tends not to pass legislation until big financial abuses occur like 2008 banking crisis or Enron. \n\nCrypto interest groups should be keeping the pulse of abuses within the marketplace and engaging with elected representatives with solutions (legislative or not) to market abuses that are synergistic with the aims of cryptocurrency.\n\nRegulations could be as common sense as fiat backed stable coin audit standards. Everyone is always complaining they think USDT audits are faked or not accurate or something so how do you get more transparency without industry standards that actually get implemented. It either has to be motivated by the market or by law and government.",

Two step ability to recover wallet in lieu of seed phrase?\n\nAutomatic refusing if sending funds somewhere they can\u2019t go (except burn which would come with a double requirement to authorise). \n\nAutomatic cross chain support. So if sending eth to a different chain it\u2019ll do it (and wrap it correctly if required - see BTC to wBTC so it can be held on Ethereum).This way all people\u2019s assets, regardless of what chain they\u2019re on, show up in one simple wallet. \n\nI\u2019d summarise by saying wallets will never be mass adopted, until an option exists that is idiot proof. If everyone was their own bank, it would be a living nightmare for most people. \n\nThe only way to swing it is some degree of centralisation, unfortunately. Metamask /others will always exist for people wanting to do it the \u2018true\u2019 way, but if my mum were to get involved she\u2019d lose access to her wallet or make a mistake that costs all her crypto in the first 30 days. I suspect that\u2019s true for most people. \n\nI also suspect the only way to keep crypto \u2018free\u2019 would be to base a centralised company somewhere that it wouldn\u2019t be interfered with.
