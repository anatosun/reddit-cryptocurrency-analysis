It's fortunate it's censorship resistant and immutable, then.\n\nPoS allows for data immutability thanks to finality. The consensus, as always whatever the proof it's based on is, decides whatever it includes before this point is reached. \n\nAnd it's censorship resistant because no one can coerce the consensus into choosing one transaction over another one, because the consensus is decentralized. It's up to the consensus to decide that. \n\nIf you want your own consensus, you can always fork away and add your own flavors of decisions.",

I also have some old Btc ant miners in my garage, that can't pay for the electricity needed to mine bitcoin, can't sell them cuz they'll never be able to mine profitably. Just about any form of mining Bitcoin requires hardware dedicated for just that.\n\nEth's PoW mining would still require me to join a mining pool, which I dont like.
