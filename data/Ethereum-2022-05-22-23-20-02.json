If Vitalik died tomorrow ETH price would crash. \n\nAlso just because BTC mining is expensive doesn\u2019t make it less decentralized. There are BTC miners all over the world and a solid distribution\n\nAnd you\u2019re kidding yourself if anyone can mine ETH without putting in significant amounts of capital. Even then they\u2019d be lucky to make any profit. This is not 5 years ago",

I just know a bunch of Ethereum miners and i've never met a person with a BTC mining rig. It always seems like it is huge mining operations that do BTC.",
