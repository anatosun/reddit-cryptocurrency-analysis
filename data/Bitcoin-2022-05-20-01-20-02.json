Just being able to build on lightning is huge. You can't build something on the visa/Mc network. You might be able to accept it but actually building on it is completely different.\nPeople don't get that triple layer accounting is the biggest accounting (the world runs on ledgers) innovation in thousands of years.\nPeople don't get that instant settlement is huge. When you swipe your card it can be a month before the vendor gets it's money normally. And has 2-3% of the sale taken out of it.  \nPeople don't understand how big cutting out all the middlemen and ignoring jurisdictional red tape is. Western Union has to get banking licensing/legal teams and so on for every last country it operates in. \nAnyone wondering about LN and btc as money should check out Jack Mallers at the BTC 2022 conference explaining how sending money and settlement traditionally works.",
