You might be able to accept it but actually building on it is completely different.\nPeople don't get that triple layer accounting is the biggest accounting (the world runs on ledgers) innovation in thousands of years.\nPeople don't get that instant settlement is huge. When you swipe your card it can be a month before the vendor gets it's money normally. And has 2-3% of the sale taken out of it.  \nPeople don't understand how big cutting out all the middlemen and ignoring jurisdictional red tape is.

Bc if its all about fairness and equal oportunities there is not better way to achieve it than Bitcoin.\n\nI suppose the problem with a big part of the left is that they are obsessed with equality of outcome, instead of equality of oportunities. And to achieve this we have to create more regulations and give more power to the state. You can see the new wave of young lefties from university with all about \"quotas\" imposed on companies and other organizations to hire their staff based on what they look like (or what they identify as) and not for who they are or their skills. The climate hysteria belief also seems to have most success with the left, so \"bitcoin is using too much electricity\"\n\nI don't wanna get into the debate of right vs. left, both have their dis- & advantages. There has been times in the past where the left was the brighter option for humanity.",
