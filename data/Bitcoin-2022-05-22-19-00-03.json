Not only can they go as long as they want saying anything they want, but you can have someone with another view or a subject matter expert on another show to share counter points. \n\nJR does a great job of listening and keeping his opinions to himself so the guest will share more. He says he\u2019s going to bring more counter arguments from different guests in the future so hopefully he follows through on that.

Because of Bitcoin's ridiculously small and finite supply compared to other assets, even chasing just 10 millionth totaling 2.1 BTC seems like a worthwhile effort.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o5otcil4p2191.jpg?width=2358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cae07a534c8e820dcc7e9783ced6c6e3ebb7736",

People have sold their houses to chase wealth in Bitcoin in the past and would've gotten 210~2100 BTC. Have heard many stories over the years on Reddit, especially the 2013 and 2017 bubbles, of people doing it and taking a leap of faith. Despite the number of people telling them don't do it. These people would be in the multi hundred millionaires now, depending on how old their post was.\n\nYou would have needed incredible foresight to have acquired 21 BTC back then while it was still cheap, and kept it till today. Now it's unreachable by many. Better get 1~2.1 BTC while you can if you want to hold a milestone number.",

So you would have bought 4.6 shares for an investment of $101. There have been 5 splits since then :\n\nJune 16, 1987: 2 for 1 = 9.2 shares\n\nJune 21, 2000: 2 for 1 = 18.4 shares\n\nFebruary 28, 2005: 2 for 1: 36.8 shares\n\n June 9, 2014: 7 for 1 = 257.6 shares\n\nAugust 28, 2020: 4 for 1 = 1030.4 shares\n\nCurrent price is $137.59 \\* 1030.4 = $141,772.74\n\nIf you'd snagged 21 BTC back in 2009 for basically nothing you'd have on the order of $630,000 today provided you didn't buy a pizza. But...\n\nBTC cannot be borrowed against (apart from shady exchanges). It does not pay a dividend (just like cash, or gold). You can't write calls against it or hedge with puts. \n\nThose 1000 shares of APPL pay an annual dividend of $0.92 each or $920 a year. I can write well out of the money covered calls for $1400-$1500 additional income each month. If I'm assigned I can write CSEPs for the same kind of income until it comes back to me. \n\nFrom an investor's POV, BTC is a highly speculative, highly volatile foreign currency. Do I own some? Yes. I also buy a little each month. I even have a couple FutureBit Apollo miners running in the basement stacking SATs. \n\nDo I expect to \"get rich\"? Nope. My lifestyle is paid for by dividend paying \"blue chip\" equities, careful options trading (mostly sale of covered calls and CSEPs) and the fact that I have virtually no debt relative that income.\n\nOh, and try that exercise with T while reinvesting dividends. (Hint - that's how \"generational wealth\" accumulates.)",

Apple is a mature company and if you had invested up to 1 millionth at any time before today, then $2.3 million worth of Apple stake is what you end up with. And the further you go back in the time curve, you would be more profitable.\n\nNo one really knows the potential of Bitcoin or altcoin, but new use cases are popping up everywhere and ability to use it as a multi-purpose financial instrument is real. \n\nSo my point is, if anyone were to bet on a a single horse that would outperform most other investments, what is the investment size needed today?\n\nI think when sizing an investment bet early in the game, buying up 1 millionth of the shares is an interesting idea. Obviously, snagging up 21 BTC is out of reach for many now so then maybe chasing 2.1 BTC would be good be a better target than trying to accumulate up to 1 or 0.28 BTC.",

You dont switch your dollars around to whatever fiat is popping off that day because you buy things with it and switching it would be a huge pain in the ass. Same with crypto's. If crypto is used as a payment, why would I keep my money out of it if its for spending on day to day things",

No one ever said that Bitcoin had to be the *only* currency. AFAICS no one is arguing Bitcoin, to be successful, has to *replace* all other forms of currency.  To the contrary, Bitcoin could become universally accepted as digital gold, or an underlying base layer as a store of value with plenty of other currencies in the world still being used.",

                    "response": "I mean lets assume money goes down 2% per year. and lets assume now its going down faster cause people simply do not see why it should retain its value. You're on a sinking ship. There's another ship, bitcoin, thats not sinking. 50% of people have hopped on to the non sinking ship. It makes no difference if you want to stay on the ship and sink thats your funeral. And your money is going down in value either way, whether you're in the first 50% or not has absolutely nothing to do with it. Your choice is to get off the sinking ship, or stay on. Think of it that way. You have cash now you're presented with a chance to \"cash out\" in to something more stable and not printable. You can buy anything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoesn't matter if you're in the first 50% to buy that thing or not. I mean it does matter in the sense that the sooner you understand that you shouldn't hold cash the sooner you'll stop holding it and you'll be better for it since the cash is constantly steadily losing value by design.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso the 50% rule simply makes no sense. I could be the first person to buy bitcoin, I could be in the 1% earliest buyers. I could buy 100% of all coins, then I could set the price to 30k per coin immediately. the 2nd person who buys it, lets say they're the 2%, they have to pay 30k per coin cause I own all of them. So by being below 50% that doesn't inherently mean anything at all. whether your 50% or not doesn't really indicate how much resources you have etc. Really maybe what you wanted to say is you want to be in the first 50% of resources to get in to bitcoin. But what you said still makes no sense. There's no way you're losing money \"cause you're in the 2nd 50%\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think what would help you is if you tried to write out the steps, one by one. Explain how this 50% rule works in an example. Write the mechanistic steps, so person in the 25% buys bitcoin, explain their steps. now explain person in the 51% buys bitcoin, and explain the situation. I think you'll find it just doesn't hold up quite as seamlessly as you made it sound. I absolutely definitely have a vague inclination of what you're getting at though, and there is some truth to it: generally being an early adopter of a new investment/technology is better than being a late adopter. But you know what else is generally true? Better late than never. There's no upside to refusing to participate in something because you believe you're late. It only makes sense to not invest if you believe its going down in value. I think thats a good place to start- don't focus on the percentages of individual so much, focus on the value itself. It doesn't matter what % I am, if im holding devaluing cash and switch to something which holds its value, im better off today than I was yesterday. Doesn't matter how long it took me to figure it out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe you're suggesting bitcoin will go up until we reach 100% adoption, and from there can only go down? which I don't agree with, but lets humor it: in that case the 50% rule still makes no sense. Why do you assume bitcoin wouldn't keep going down beyond wherever it was when the 50% person bought in?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets take a look at another investment. Real estate. Lots of families have real estate. Maybe most families. Does that mean its too late to buy real estate and that you'd actually be losing money by buying real estate? I see no reason to assume that would be the case? it could be true, sure, but there's no indication that that is DEFINITELY true? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets just humor this thought, I don't believe this necessarily, but this is an example simply to show you how your view simply doesn't make sense. lets say in the year 2,000 50% of people own real estate. and lets say in the year 2010 100% of the people own real estate. and lets say in 2020 the value of real estate is higher still. So was it a mistake to take your devaluing cash and put it in to real estate?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr lets imagine in 2060 everyone uses bitcoin, we're at \"full\" adoption, and price rises by 40% each year for the past 40 years. and in 2100, everyone still uses bitcoin, and the price has kept rising? why? cause they keep printing money and the population keeps growing. and people simply feel the value should rise? Why does the value of the Mona Lisa go up over time? Its the same painting as it was the year before? everyones already aware of its existence? You need to detail this out more. 50% of a population invests in something, on its face it means nothing. Explain your thought process more, what are the series of events and how does this 50% come in to play with those events.",

I hope that if I go to this post on buttcoin even they would say this is not the writing of someone who understands how investing works, not even someone who understands how investing in stocks works. This statement makes no sense, and this same statement, applied to stocks, would also make no sense. Its hard to even pinpoint where to start explaining how this is wrong cause its unclear how the writer believes the mechanics of the situation work. The statements are all very disconnected from each other, though the author appears to repeatedly allude to what they seem to think is an obvious connection. In reality the shortest way I can answer the question is \"that is simply not how it works.\". I think from there, in an ideal world, you would begin to ask questions starting with the first question that pops in to your head, and we in this thread can bring you question by question to a more accurate understanding of the dynamics at play here.",

Christmas lights, computer gaming, sporting industry, all uses huge amounts of energy. \n\nStandard extreme views which always leads to prosperity for humanity doesn't it...selective dictatorship characteristics.\n\nThe gap in equality grows and grows but I don't see these far left individuals talking about that or trying to find a solution. \n\nIf people were actually being fair and logical they'd ask themselves; is there any good in finding a solution for millions of people to protect their wealth? How much better would the environment be if everyone on the planet could be lifted out of poverty? Reduction in polluting habits, exploitation of the natural world and it's creatures to put food on your families table, rid the world of bush meat trade, poaching, drug trade, slavery trade etc etc\n\nGive people the means to protect their wealth and I'd very much imagine that the world starts becoming a better place. Unfortunately people cannot see things in a holistic way, they focus on siloed fashionable topics which they pursue to purely make themselves feel better about their lives. Total lacking in emotional intelligence as they are consumed by intellectual insecurity. The narcissist pandemic will rage on for years, they will never admit they are wrong even when the facts are undeniable. Not yours or mine concern, they will adopt CBDC'S and will have limited financial freedom.\n\nGreat people create and do they don't go around pouring criticism onto others who are at least trying to improve things. \n\nEven if Bitcoin fails then surely it's better to at least try to improve the way humanity distributes economic gain and preserves individual wealth. If we carry on with this trajectory of poverty then how do you think it all ends?? Peacefully....I don't think so and I can safely say war in human society is far worse for the environment than anything else.\n\nWhen Bitcoin is 100% renewable my guess is the narrative from the elite publications and banking giants will change dramatically into pro Bitcoin. Energy grids are like musical symphonies and base loads are vital to the health of energy grids. Bitcoin fills this gap beautifully and energy companies know this now and are actively working with Bitcoin miners. 100% renewable and there's no attack.\n\nDraw your mind map (pro and con diagram) and stick to the facts. Then you'll have more conviction one way or the other. Individual choice is democracy, how I use my energy I pay for is my choice, especially if I create that energy myself.",
