When you\u2019re done paying it back, the bank erases the money from their balance sheet. \nSo the money comes out of thin air and vanishes into thin air. Money Supply before and after the loan are identical.\n\nThis would be totally fine, but taking out a loan gives you an advantage over your competition, forcing them to take out loans themselves. \nThis leads to excessive loans which widens the total money supply.\nEvery future loan getting even bigger because the money loses its value. \nIt\u2019s like a death cycle that will collapse sooner or later.",

But while the loan is taken out, the money supply has temporarily grown, this lasts until the loan is paid in full.\n\nMost of these loans are very long term like 10-30 years to pay back the full amount. Often those loan payments are even payed back with money from new loans. \n\nTheoretically the money supply should come back to what it was before. But practically the size of the the loans constantly increase. And with this debt increasing, the money supply is increasing as well. \nIn theory it\u2019s just temporarily and if you just look at every loan individual this seems fine. But the combination of all those loans is what builds up this huge house of cards.\n\nJust google some figures of debt for the US, companies or private individuals. It\u2019s constantly increasing over time. \n\nIn 2008 we saw a dip because nobody wanted to lend money to anyone but otherwise it\u2019s increasing exponentially.

This increases the money supply, because that printed USD is now in circulation. \n\nTo decrease the money supply: The federal reserve sells debt back to the US market, taking the USD proceeds out of supply.\n\nQuantitative easing (QE) refers to increasing the money supply through the behavior described above--this method was the status quo until recently. Quantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process, the selling of the debt instruments by the Fed in exchange for USD, which is no longer in supply.\n\nThere is also the matter of the Fed interest rates, which has a bearing on the value of these debt instruments, and the cost banks must pay to borrow money from each other. I believe that by increasing these interest rates, it makes it more expensive for banks to borrow money, and this means they are less likely to do so for investment purposes, thus siphoning liquidity from between banks.",
