Under PoS, ETH will be deflationary if gas prices are over ~10-15 Gwei. This means that the supply will decrease until network traffic either falls off or the supply of liquid ETH gets low enough that  the price of ETH increases and the average price users are willing to pay for transactions is less than the 10-15 Gwei threshold. \n\nMy guess is that the supply will equalize around 100 million ETH, give or take a few million.",

The reason for that is that the burn is a (small) proportion of whatever is left, not of the original amount. As a very simplified example, if we started with 100M eth and burned 1% per year (1M burn the first year), once the supply reached 90M, the burn would be 1% of 90M, that is 0.9M. At 50M, the burn is \"only\" 0.5M, etc. After 100 years, there would still be 36.6M eth left (not 0!).",

It has implementations on both ETH mainnet and on zkSync, and you can access both in the same app. The zkSync part of the app basically lets you trade certain tokens, buy crypto with fiat through Ramp Network, and get yield on certain assets through bridged Gro and Yearn tokens. \n\nLedger Live is an app interface you can use with your Ledger hardware wallet, and it does pretty much everything on mainnet- hence the high fees you mentioned. \n\nYou can transfer assets between these wallets, but you'll need to [activate your Ledger's ETH address on zkSync](https://wallet.zksync.io/) first and then bridge assets there. Then you can transfer from your Ledger's zkSync address to your Argent address. \n\nNow, technically you *can* stake ETH through Argent and then transfer to your Ledger. The process would look like this starting with ETH on mainnet:\n\n1. Bridge ETH to zkSync on your ledger\n2. Activate your address on zkSync\n3. Transfer ETH from your zkSync ledger address to your zkSync Argent address\n4. Buy wstETH or whichever staking option you prefer\n5. Transfer the wstETH or icETH from Argent to your zkSync Ledger \n\nStep 1 would cost $20-$40 in gas most likely, with the rest of the steps being pretty cheap. You're probably better off just buying ETH directly on Argent and staking in the app.",
