                                    "response": "It's a good question, but one with no short answer. Here are some points which come to mind, but as I'm short on time I've probably missed a bunch.\n\n* Bitcoin has the longest track history and therefore is seen as the most trustworthy (see [Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect)). In other words, out of all protocols it is the most battle tested and least likely to have a critical flaw. This is further compounded by Bitcoin's exceedingly cautious development lifecycle.\n* Related to the above, Bitcoin has the most iron-clad distribution schedule and cap. This is built into the protocol. It is the only protocol which is credibly scarce as other protocols are much easier to change.\n* Bitcoin had the fairest launch. Satoshi released the whitepaper prior to the first version of the client, and coins circulated for a couple of years without a price evaluation. There was no pre-mine given to insiders. These days it's more or less impossible to have a fair cryptocurrency launch, because the cat's out of the bag so to speak. People now know that cryptocurrencies are lucrative, and whales will scoop up the lion's share of coins and manipulate markets.\n* Satoshi left the project a couple of years into its inception, and to our knowledge there is no evidence they spent any of the coins they mined. Not only does the lack of an active founder benefit the decentralization of the network (because there's no figurehead to bribe or coerce), but it also helps Bitcoin remain credibly apolitical. This is tremendously important for Bitcoin to become a neutral world reserve asset.\n* Bitcoiners frequently warn about the centralizing pressures of other consensus mechanisms (such as proof-of-stake). This is a bit of a separate discussion, but we proof of work is seen as the most fair, secure and decentralized method of consensus. It's anything but \"outdated tech\" as many influencers might have you believe, and there must be a cost to block production. Out of the PoW coins, Bitcoin is far ahead of any other coin and has the most mature mining network.\n* Bitcoin simply has the best track record. Not once in its history has another project taken its place as the #1 coin. To be honest I view this as a weak point because market cap is not a useful metric and easily manipulated, but others hold it in high regard so I thought I'd mention it.\n\nLastly, most tokens are claiming to have value based on providing some utility that Bitcoin doesn't provide. But Bitcoiners generally believe utility tokens to be pointless because it reintroduces the problem of barter. In the same way that one doesn't have separate forms of money for Amazon, Uber or Microsoft, so it is the same for oracles, defi and governance tokens. Any utilities which are actually useful will simply be built on top of the Bitcoin stack and priced in bitcoin rather than a silly token (so-called layer 2 / layer 3 applications).\n\nHope that helps. If you were interested in reading more, there's honestly a wealth of information out there if you go looking for it.

So I'd have a claim on essentially one out of 21M things in the world, roughly speaking.

Or sticking with Exodus will be fine for now? \n\nAt least it isn't in an exchange :)\n\nThank you guys",

One of my questions about Bitcoin is... how the heck will it ever become universally used and accepted as money when it's so difficult to transact with, and you have to keep it in storage, can lose your keys etc? Like, to compete with fiat currencies, isn't Bitcoin going to need to be readily spendable? Makes me think of gold, where nobody walks around shaving off pieces of gold to buy stuff. Not feasible at all, hence paper (and now electronic) money. I guess I can't imagine the average Joe figuring out how to do this and use cold storage, and not lose their freaking keys. I think the average person is far too stupid to handle this stuff. Like... my grandma would never have been able to do this. Without these third party custodians simplifying my ability to send BTC around whenever I want, it seems unfeasible as a currency. Just trying to understand this aspect of it :)",
