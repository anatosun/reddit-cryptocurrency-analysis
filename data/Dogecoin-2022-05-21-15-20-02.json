It wasn\u2019t a fortune by any means, and I could of sold it during ATHs to really see significant profit. I wanted to HODL, but life had other plans. \n\nI just wanted to say thank you r/dogecoin I found you when I really wasn\u2019t sure what to think about crypto currencies. I missed out on BTC like many of you, and decided I wasn\u2019t missing out again. \n\nThis won\u2019t be it for me , I\u2019ll find my way back when it\u2019s financially possible. Until We meet on the moon!",
