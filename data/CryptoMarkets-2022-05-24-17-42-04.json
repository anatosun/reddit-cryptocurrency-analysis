            "selftext": "Bitcoin and the vast majority of alts are at the lowest they\u2019ve been in a year now and a lot of people are feeling frustrated and nervous (myself included).\n\nHowever, I this hasn\u2019t been stopping companies from buying cryptocurrencies and even implementing chains and protocols into their businesses.\n\nThis gives even more confidence in the future of crypto cause if I know one thing, it is that top major companies rarely ever take bad financial decisions. Of course, there will always be exceptions with bad decisions, but the way that these major companies reached the top is through teams of financial consultants leading the way in the background.\n\nSo fact that these companies are entering the crypto makes me want to stay to see how the future of the market turns out.\n\nYou got UbiSoft and Atari, two of the largest gaming developers in the world, are developing games in the P2E market.  \nGameStop has already made huge waves in the crypto community. And Stripe, the 5th largest fintech company in the world and the 6th most used payment app in the US is working with Polygon. Also, Instagram is working with Polygon as well to enable users to display their NFT on their profiles.\n\nThe short-term sentiment of the market looks horrible right now, but if you look long term all you can see is bullish news on bullish news. That\u2019s just my opinion but it\u2019s an opinion that\u2019s backed by facts.",
