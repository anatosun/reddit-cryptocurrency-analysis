He stated that transparency has become even more important with the recent \u201cmeltdown\u201d of the UST stablecoin, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has pointed out. \n\nHe gave [Ripple and XRP](https://swapzone.io/currencies/ripple) as an example of transparent players in the industry, saying the two have done their best to be the \u201cadult\u201d in the financial sector.\n\nNow the crypto sector has, more than ever, attracted regulators\u2019 scrutiny. Gary Gensler, chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), recently warned investors that other crypto assets could mimic Terra\u2019s downfall. \n\nOn the other hand, Ripple, along with its executives Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, continue to engage with the SEC in the one-and-a-half years-long law lawsuit. \n\nDo you believe that other crypto could follow the suit of Terra? \n\n[Source: blazetrends.com](https://preview.redd.it/hj63rj8h5m191.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=7975851c430e3203df0310cc8857209dd3ec8c55)",
