The coins (UTXO) model of Bitcoin spending means that there is only one place where a money amount is stored - the amount field in a transaction output (TXO). This is an *int64* which stores an integer count of Satoshis  \nhttps://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/transactions.html#txout-a-transaction-output\n\n> 2^51\n\nWhich leaves 12 bits of headroom for future divisibility, if required",
