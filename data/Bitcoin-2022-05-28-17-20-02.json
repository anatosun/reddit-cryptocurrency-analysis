I know the basics but am definitely not an expert. Two things that are bugging me that I am not sure how to verify are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. I'm running my own Umbrel Node. How do I actually know that this thing is part of the grand decentralized bitcoin network, and not just a slick GUI ontop of a wallet? How do I know that I am participating in the network and helping to decentralize it? I can look in the SSD and look at the files that its downloaded, but how do I VERIFY that this thing is actually validating blocks proposed from the miners? \n2. I use a trezor wallet to store my btc. I know that it is open source and everything, but I'm too dumb to figure out how to access that and read it, and even if I could, I'm not a programmer, so idk what it would actually be saying. But how do I verify that, for example, when I connect my wallet and either a) install new firmware or b) download the latest version of the trezor suite, how do I know someone somewhere, or the trezor team themselves arent going to just hack my wallet and take everything? I can trust when people say \"that can't happen\" but how do I fricking VERIFY this? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease help a dumb bitcoin enthusiast out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTY",

Any bitcoin holder is betting on bitcoin to work, and for bitcoin to work, it needs to be trustable by the end user. To that end, there must be a base of open, trustable software. If there is a bad actor creating software, only the bad actor gains from their actions. Everyone else is motivated to shut them down, and thus open-source software is key. If tools don't exist, someone will create them and someone else will verify that they're legit, because both parties are financially motivated to build an honest bitcoin ecosystem.",

It's not too technical, and we're here if you have questions or run into any issues.\n\nI will say Umbrel is the best running software I've tried for running a node as far as uptime and stability.\n\nI hear Trezor is alright but I've never tried one.",

There are technical people looking for issues, in fact, anyone technical enough can chime in. This is much better than a closed source system where you simply trust those who know what is in the system and no outside parties can verify their work. \n\nMaybe instead of verify don't trust. Find someone trustable who can verify, because in an open source system there are many more people who will verify/audit a system.",

If you can verify that your node knows about public addresses and transactions, there's a high probability that you are part of the real network.\n\n2.  If you have a hardware wallet that never connects to your computer or the Internet, you can know that your keys are safe.  I don't know enough about Trezor to know if it meets these requirements.  It's always possible for firmware to give you pre-determined or easy to hack keys.  To prevent this, you can generate your own seed phrase by rolling dice.\n\nYou don't have to be a genius to figure this stuff out.  Just spend some time thinking about it from a thief's point of view.  What would it take to steal someone's bitcoin?  What could you do to counter it?  Are there simple tests to verify that things work the way you think they work?",
