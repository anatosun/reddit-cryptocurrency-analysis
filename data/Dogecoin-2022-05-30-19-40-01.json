In the same manner we can do the same for Doge. The Doge fam. needs to come together and remove from the exchanges all the coin that we are planning to HODL. Keep all our coin in the exchange allows them to short the coin that they did not pay for so if they want to short the coin then the better purchase the coin they want to short. Remember not your keys, not your coin.\n\nWe are a Doge Nation and we do only good.",
