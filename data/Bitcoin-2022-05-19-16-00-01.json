I asked them if there was a digital way to receive for them to get paid, but had virtually no fees if they would like me to show them how to set it up.  They were super interested and I was able to get them set up on lightning. \n\nSo now, I get to pay for my lunch with BTC on the lightning network.",

This is why the switch to bitcoin, when it happens, will be more sudden than a lot of folks are expecting. It's always better to spend the same currency as you earn, so there's a positive feedback loop that reinforces the dominant currency.",
