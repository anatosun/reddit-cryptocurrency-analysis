            "selftext": " An interesting question came up during discussion of #Bitcoin is Venice Chapter 1: Wrestling with the Truth. If there is an analogy to be drawn between Bitcoin and mixed martial arts \u2013 is Bitcoin a fighter or the Octagon itself? There is an argument to be made both ways:\n\nBitcoin is a fighter. Bitcoin is a nascent form of money, currently slugging it out against the incumbent fiat standard, and gaining ground. It is the challenger taking on a grizzled champion whose reign has gone on just that little bit too long, ready to be toppled (though many assume he is unassailable). \n\nBitcoin is the Octagon. Achieving economic success under a Bitcoin standard is a totally different sport to easy-money spigot guzzling. Fiat favours the fighter who bribes the referee. The fights are fixed, and insider bets are placed by those in-the-know. By contrast, Bitcoin\u2019s rules are enforced by code and only the strong survive. Thinkers and doers flourish in free markets. \n\nSo, the analogy is fractal in nature (h/t Sacha Meyers). There are market participants, markets, and a marketplace for markets (a meta-market?!). It would be a depressing irony if the free market itself was uncompetitive when facing off against centrally planned economies. Yet, to a certain extent, isn\u2019t that the story of the fiat era? The ghost of the gold standard poses little threat to those who have learned to exploit its Achilles\u2019 heel (centralisation). \n\nBitcoin, however, is an altogether different prospect. It has a strong ground game and impeccable defence. It can\u2019t be f\\*cked with. Sovereign individuals who aren\u2019t afraid of a little competition are recognising its value and stepping into the Octagon. It might be a fringe sport now (attracting mostly psychopaths), but it\u2019s on the path to becoming a global arena, achieving dominance through sly, roundabout means \u2013 voluntary consensus. \n\nNow that our market metaphors are thoroughly mixed\u2026 what do you think? \n\nMSW - Data Analyst at CoinCorner - a great place to [Buy Bitcoin](https://www.coincorner.com/)",
