The beginning stages of collapse will certainly include episodes of federally mandated bail ins and subsequent bank runs. Mass panic will ensue as the ill advised populace who probably store a large chunk of their savings in a regular current account stumble to get everything out, but will be too late. \n\nAt this stage, those people who stored their savings in BTC via a private wallet will look like absolute geniuses.\n\nBut what happens after this is anyone\u2019s guess. The spectrum of collapse could end there or stretch to breakouts of civil wars all over the globe, potentially spilling over into another World War (some would argue we\u2019re already at the beginning of WW3 but I digress).\n\nIn any situation, I like to remain optimistic about BTC\u2019s importance in a universal global collapse. The protocol is open, permission-less and doesn\u2019t care who you are or what side you fight for. It may even be the only way to send value from one side of the planet to another if shit really hits the fan. In the midst of geopolitical uncertainty and the turning of a new global civilisation, it\u2019s logical to assume that an open source, trustless monetary network will be the difference between life and death for many people. Circular BTC economies are already thriving and will only continue to grow if people continue to lose faith in the current system. \n\nThough I would like to say I know shit about fuck and this is all just playful conjecture on my part.
