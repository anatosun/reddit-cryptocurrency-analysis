            "selftext": "So have you heard about this legal case going on in Brazil  right now involving Binance ?\n\nNow basically a guy had loads Of SHIB coins and somehow he was hacked, his coins were on a platform called MetaMask and using analysis he found out that his coins were transferred to Binance.\n\nOf course he contacted Binance and asked them to lock the wallet, at first they said they were going to do it but later just ignored him leading to a court case in front of a Brazilian court, can you believe this. ?\n\nBinance argued in front of the court they had no connection to MetaMask and therefore didn't lock the wallet despite  the proof submitted, what do you guys think about this ?\n\nI'm on Binance right now but have no idea whether to continue being here because of this, I understand that they are just protecting their business but come on.\n\nWould you consider switching to other exchanges like Coinbase or Dura-fi and do you know of similar cases involving them and could you recommend some other reputable and secure exchanges ?\n\nI understand that I might be taking this to seriously but I tend to take notice of these things !",

Ridiculous.\n\nObviously they could ask you to complete certain transactions to prove ownership, etc., but by that point it's probably too late anyways.\n\nPoint being... don't do dumb things with your keys.",
