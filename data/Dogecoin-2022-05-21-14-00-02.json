There is definitely and will be more market cap in the future and just like this last run up, another catalyst will come along. It always does and crypto can not be delisted like some stock, however it can keep losing its value. Do I think that will happen? Not as long as the memes keep going. I see a lot room for another run up. Deflation will decrease the longer it is around and it is out pacing every other crypto on the market.  Laugh if you want it is just a matter of time.",
