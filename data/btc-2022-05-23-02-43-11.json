Do you ?\n\nI  mean some of these things sell for millions of dollars and after you  purchase them they could be worth zero. I understand that it feels like a   very attractive proposition to the 'artist' making them because he  could potentially earn a lot from very little work but come on.\n\nDo you know what else blockchain can do ?  \nFor instance there is a project MS Recovery that utilizes blockchain to make a healthcare insurance system,  \nMicrosoft  is utilizing it to make Digital ID, there is a company called World  Mobile Token that utilizes blockchain to make a network that could in  the future connect the entire African continent, there are limitless  things that can be done and limitless choices where you can invest your  money why on earth would you use it buy dumb shit ?\n\nI understand that I might be harsh but do you agree that there are much smarter investments than NFTart ?",

But in particular, it flowed to the SIMPLEST, easiest to explain ideas.\n\nIf you were a kickass salesman you could literally get millions of dollars in VC funding by just saying \"It's a pet store, but on the internet.\"\n\nIt took Ryan Cohen like 30 years to make that into a workable idea.\n\nPoint is, while all of these incredibly stupid people were throwing money at \"the internet\" just hoping something would stick the actual developers were churning through ideas and code and some stuff worked and some didn't, but oftentimes even those failed ventures produced dividends in the form of interesting technology that could be applied elsewhere in a manner that was actually useful.\n\nAll we can see is the foam on top of the waves, but underneath the water real work is being done. It'll be a few years before we see the fruits of that labor though. I sort of view this as an inevitable churn in the development cycle of a disruptive technology. If humans knew a better way of getting where we want to go we'd do it, but nobody has a crystal ball and the best most people can do is throw money at a project and hope they are as good as their word.\n\nThis too shall pass. NFT is an incredibly powerful technology, and jpegs are certainly the Dumbest Timeline, but it's easier to swallow if you view this as an unavoidable traffic jam on the road to real progress.",

In order for the nft system to add value to users then the company has to promise to always use the nft blockchain in its digital card game and also I think its important that even if the company doesn't like you it can't prevent you from using your cards in the card game. But I'm struggling with the potential of the company sanctioning specific cards that they think belong to someone and then even if the cards are traded to another person they are still sanctioned/worthless",
