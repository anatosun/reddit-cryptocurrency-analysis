I don\u2019t know as much as i\u2019d like, but what i guess and see from what i\u2019ve read:\n\nBinance do seem to be backing away from it and emphasising BUSD. Their volume for BUSD pairs are ahead of some USDT. \n\nAs for others, i\u2019m unsure. I get the feeling it has reached such a level of adoption, i don\u2019t think they can now get users to move - and they don\u2019t want to hit their volume and drive users to competitors who do still use USDT. Remember new pairs involve a huge outlay to back them with liquidity pools. Many smaller exchanges can\u2019t \u2018just switch\u2019 because they effectively have to double their cost of liquidity pools to switch to USDC for example. A \u2018gentle\u2019 move away will likely see poor adoption, and a big move is too costly.\n\nThat would be my non-conspiracy theory. Putting the tinfoil hat on, many have suggested the CEXs are in cahoots with USDT, and are facilitating USDT effectively being backed by itself by laundering through the exchanges",
