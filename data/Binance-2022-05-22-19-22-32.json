This committee works with the company to develop a plan to reorganize the business and get it out of debt, reshaping it into a profitable entity. Shareholders may be given a vote on the plan, but that is never guaranteed. If no suitable reorganization plan can be devised by the committee and confirmed by the courts, shareholders may not be able to stop the company's assets from being sold off to pay creditors.\n\nUnder Chapter 7 of U.S. Bankruptcy Code, \"the company stops all operations and goes completely out of business. A trustee is appointed to liquidate (sell) the company's assets, and the money is used to pay off debt,\" the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission notes.1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sure its really up to him.\n\nIf Binance has the money to repay all users, why would it be going bankrupt?",
