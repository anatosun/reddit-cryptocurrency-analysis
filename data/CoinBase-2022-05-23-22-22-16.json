I received an email indicating that one or more of my transactions violated cardholder agreement and that the card cannot be unblocked. I reviewed the cardholder agreement and there is not one transaction that violates the agreement. My purchases are all Target, Costco, Amazon, grocery stores and restaurants. I emailed them a copy of my transactions asking them to identify which transaction was in violation. Their reply: \n\u201cThanks for your response. On the other hand, please know that we are not able to provide specific details/reasons that triggers the Card to be blocked for security reasons.This is how the process works and we appreciate your patience on this. Thanks for choosing Coinbase. Have a great day!\u201d \n\nDon\u2019t know if they are working on this or just given up on helping me. Clearly this is a mistake and possibly an error. Please reinvestigate my transactions and my case. \n\nCase number 11960461",
