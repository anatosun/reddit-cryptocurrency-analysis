I received an email indicating that one or more of my transactions violated cardholder agreement and that the card cannot be unblocked. I reviewed the cardholder agreement and there is not one transaction that violates the agreement. My purchases are all Target, Costco, Amazon, grocery stores and restaurants. I emailed them a copy of my transactions asking them to identify which transaction was in violation. Their reply: \n\u201cThanks for your response. On the other hand, please know that we are not able to provide specific details/reasons that triggers the Card to be blocked for security reasons.This is how the process works and we appreciate your patience on this. Thanks for choosing Coinbase. Have a great day!\u201d \n\nDon\u2019t know if they are working on this or just given up on helping me. Clearly this is a mistake and possibly an error. Please reinvestigate my transactions and my case. \n\nCase number 11960461",

One thing I know is companies like PayPal, Coinbase & many others don\u2019t want to tell people what happened or explain for \u201csecurity reasons\u201d any time something happens like account freezes. Honestly, I usually defend CB because a lot of people try to blame them for their user error but if all you bought was food, if that is true, then this doesn\u2019t make sense. They do have an FAQ about things you cannot use the card to buy but it\u2019s like guns & weapons. For that, I use one of my credit cards.",
