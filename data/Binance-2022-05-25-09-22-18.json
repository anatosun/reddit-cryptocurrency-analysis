He is arrogant prick and now he has even more problems then before. \n2. This coin will be another money grab for VC and other whales caught of guard. \n3. Big wigs also will keep close eye on this and will use ban hammer when nobody expect it. \n\n4. Do Kwon got massive tax bill. You all think this goes away? New coin , new tax bill. One way or another. \n\nNot saying do not take part to juice this opportunity but be careful as hell. \n\nThis is another money grab. Nothing new.",
