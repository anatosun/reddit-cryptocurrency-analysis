There is operational, functional shorting to use your capital to push down the price exchange of the asset if there's no one really competing to keep price stabilized. Or enough volume to even move it up. And retail haven't posed a great enough opposition. So, the whale buying could have been various reasons. Keep it in a range, loaning it, using it as collateral, or the remote possibility of a jump coming. However, most do not have a strategy of buying in plans that it's going to Valhalla to flip like most individuals basic trading strategy. They can plan to sit on the losses whereby many retail cannot. I don't doubt that BTC \"whales\" who caused the 2017 dump sat on those higher priced coins with a projected plan to run the price up after securing more exchanges, miners, implementing ETFs/options/futures, staking, margin through exchanges or brokerages, etc.",
