You don't need to trust self-regulation, because self-regulation isn't enforced onto people. It's proposed. You retain self-sovereignty. So, you don't need to trust it. Rather, you choose it only if you think it works. The dependency is reversed: you're the one in control of the decision and therefore you're the one responsible for your decisions. The fact some products work and some others don't then becomes an ecosystem that already offers the services you're looking for. All you need after that is a set of tools allowing you to easily judge which services are the ones you're needing. \n\nIt's very different from state enforced regulations: you need to trust these state regulations to be continuously working and you won't have a choice but to suffer from it the instant or doesn't work anymore.",
