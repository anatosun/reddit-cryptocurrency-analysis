The exchange just says you own so much of x crypto in their spreadsheets, there is no guarantee they are actually holding x crypto. I got burned by Quadridga that turned out to be a scam, don't be dumb like me. Use your own wallets and only keep on exchanges when you are actively trading. \n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47203706\n\nWallets, whether they be hardware or software  just give you full control over your crypto as they help you manage the key that protects your assets defined in the public ledger. If you have a sizable amount, hardware wallets are nice because it lowers the risk of them becoming compromised because your keys are stored offline.",

Maybe theres some lobby by people who sell ledgers, maybe theres some lobbies by hackers (not for pushing into ledgers, those are unhackeable but to use wallets which also put you in control of your keys, which are unhackeable as long as you follow basic security) but those must be minimal, the bottom line in my opinion is that its a win win for everyone except big exchanges",
