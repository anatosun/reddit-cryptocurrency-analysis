I would assume that other states have resources for students. \n\nIf someone really wanted to get a free (well not free \ud83e\udd23) ride plus money in their pocket for going to school, sign a contract for 4 years of your life to the reserve. \n\nThe U.S. takes very good care of their veterans.\nThe support system for veterans is amazing, but that's a whole other conversation or argument depending on how you see it.",

I just went for 13 months and received a hefty amount of benefits. \n\nPlus if you are really knowledgeable about it, VA disability can go a very long way \ud83d\udc4d I think it's chapter 36 that you can use if you get a rating of 10%. Which hands down I would use that in a heart beat!\n\nAlso, if you're at the end of your post 9/11 benefits and haven't used any of you're Montgomery GI Bill. You can then transfer your Montgomery for 12 more months with the post 9/11 benefits \ud83d\udc4d\n\nI learned that the other day from a benefit course on Ft. Campbell \ud83d\ude05\n\nSo boom use VR & E if you can get a rating for disability and then use post 9/11 and then roll over your Montgomery.\n\nYou'll have a lifetime of education benefits \ud83e\udd23",

It's completely free even for foreigner afaik, it has no admission test, as long as youre willing to keep trying you can keep taking the courses and exams. Also Argentina currently has very low costs of living in dollars. I strongly suggest everyone considering spending a shitton on a mid to low tier college, just pay for spanish lessons get him to study here and when he returns you can buy him a boat.",

I honestly mean that, just be sure you also look into why there hasn't been a massive flood of people getting degrees from there... it doesn't necessarily mean employers will look at a degree from there and pay you the same as someone with a 'ivy league' degree.  The system is broke but gotta play the system.  You can make 100k+ without a degree, just depends what you do and who you know is a large chunk of that.",
