Well, I bought around $10k yesterday so hopefully it evens out.\n\nBut seriously, people like  u/JarmoViikki were always on the wrong side, in crypto ONLY to increase their USD, so if a crypto fails to increase their USD they see it as a failure. Of course, this is beyond stupid, like saying if Amazon stock doesn't increase in price one year it's a failed company.\n\nI post this only because I know we are going to have A LOT of kids like u/JarmoViikki who get angry and confused, just try to support them and be nice, I know it's hard for me.",

We don't know how much of his net worth was tied up in BCH. It's hard watching a substantial part of your future evaporate.\n\n\nMarc De Mesel had a good point in one of his interviews, 'one needs to get to a personal level of self sufficiency before one can invest in others'.\n\n\nPersonally I mourn his loss and all the others that silently lost faith.",

It's understandable because that's very common.\n\n\nOne might really believe in a digital currency to be used in commerce and go all in wanting to whole heartedly support the idea of **Separating Money from State** then watch your life savings evaporate in front of you in a Bear Market. Get cold feet thinking the idea just won't work and you have to feed your family, or the time is just not right for [*Permissionless P2P Money For The World*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mBc0Zk1YWs&t=148s). I remember some very low points, Dev's growing despondent, Bitcoin Unlimited Assert(0) DDOS attack, XT node DDOS... and yes painful price swings I probably only held on because I could afford to.\n\n\n\nBut in reality I believe 99%+ to be on a spectrum split between Medium of Exchange, Store of Value, Long Term Investment, Get Rich Quick.... and of those 99%+, 99%+ have their breaking point.",

Meaning maybe BCH really **is** like digital gold, or is at least intended to be, but not gold bullion (bulk amount).\n\nFor example, [here](https://www.ebay.com/itm/164961330561) is a **Cash Gold** note (polymer with embedded 100mg gold bar). There are at least two fundamentally different ways of looking at gold: it should either be stored as bullion, or else stored as **cash** (divided into lots & lots of tiny bars, embedded in currency). Supporters of fiat see gold as just a **S**tore-**O**f-**V**alue, which shouldn't be used directly as currency. I suspect some of the same ppl prefer BTC because its block-size limit means only large amounts (like bullion) should ever exist on-chain, stopping its use as cash.",
