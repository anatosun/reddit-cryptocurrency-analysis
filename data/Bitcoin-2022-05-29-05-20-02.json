However, they are uninformed that merchants using BTC instead of Visa, Mastercard, and AMEX eliminate a 3-5% processing fee that goes outside the country. It equates to like 5% of their GDP that with BTC will stay in the country. Retailers/merchants can exchange back to USD immediately after the transaction for free. Citizens are not forced to hold BTC.\n\nAdditionally, citizens living in the US and sending money back to their families are losing up to 10% in transfer and conversion fees. If they convert to BTC, send, and receive, they can again convert back to USD if they want but essentially can transfer money for free. This is just a micro example of one of the many benefits of BTC. \n\nThe general public make their conclusions on BTC and are quick with the \"told you so\" comments because they don't understand what BTC is and all its implications. They are rejecting \"what they think BTC is\". That's a good sign because education is increasing. If you think about it, it's pretty amazing its gotten this far with such minimal understanding by the public.",

They seem to be fighting for their independence from the US dollar and are betting on all the benefits BTC could provide. They definently think BTC is going to rise in value over the next 100+ years.\n\nThe attraction of the BTC network for transfers, is that it can't be controlled. Stablecoins are controlled by a centralized organization and can be regulated by governments. For example, Circle freezes USDC transfers at the request of the government. If El Salvador seems threatening by changing its currency, the world's governments could more easily intervene. Over the next 100+ years, what stablecoin does El Salvador use?\n\nI'm new to learning about Lightning apps for using BTC but I know there are developments to let you send and receive in your native currency. So the fluctuating value of BTC won't have an affect. You will send in USD, the app will convert and transfer to/from BTC, and the recipient will receive in USD. It will happen lighting fast between any global currencies you choose. El Salvadorians can use this practice for as long as they want. No force to holding BTC but over the next 100+ years, BTC could very easily become fully adopted and the country will be fully prepared with its infrastructure.\n\nPresident Bukele of El Salvador has a good interview with Peter McCormack you should watch. He explains the reasons for BTC. We need smaller countries like this to provide some experimentation on BTC.",
