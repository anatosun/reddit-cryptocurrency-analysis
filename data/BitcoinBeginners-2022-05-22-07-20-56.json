            "selftext": "Quite new to Bitcoin and other crypto, but initially, it sounded like crypto is the freedom money - private, untraceable, untaxable, take it anywhere, use it however you like. But how it is private if KYC verification is a requirement to buy on most, if not all, exchanges? How is it private if all transactions are 100% traceable? Isn\u2019t it exactly the opposite of what crypto was aspiring to be, the \u201cfreedom\u201d money? The more I read and think about it, the more is seems quite the opposite: the global, digital money that can be easily controlled - say/do the opposite of current narrative, don't comply/disagree with the next \"thing\", wrong nationality/race/citizenship, etc and just like your bank account, your crypto wallet is also \"frozen\", no?",

Thus you can choose to have the bitcoin linked to your ID or not depending how you use it. \n\nKeep in mind that over 99% of transactions occur offchain or on other layers though that have different levels of privacy and chain analysis is not possible . For example if you use Bitcoin in a lightning wallet(how you would normally spend bitcoin for day to day things)  chain analysis is useless and you are very private because its multihop and onion routed by default. \n\nThere are also many ways to buy or get bitcoin without ID but this is not needed because even if you initially bought bitcoin with ID its trivial to regain your privacy after the fact",

I haven't bought any crypto yet, trying to figure out the best way to do it for my main goals -  hold and hopefully gain, and in case of need, for example if moving countries, not having to pay tax twice (income tax 1st time, tax on taking money out of the country 2nd time). \n\nAt the very tip of the iceberg \"knowledge\" I have, it just seems if I go and buy on exchange right now, the tax man will straight away take note and will send me a bill the moment I board the plane. I'm exaggerating, of course, but taking substantial amounts of money from one country to another without incurring losses seems tricky. So I thought perhaps crypto, as volatile as it is and as risky as that would hence be, could present a solution, but maybe not so, if one didn't initially buy without ID.\n\nOther than cash, what other ways are there to buy/get crypto without ID, if you don't mind sharing?",

Make sure you send the entire amount each time as well. \n\n2)\tWhen you are ready to spend your bitcoin in your hardware wallet there are many ways to sell or spend the bitcoin very privately like loading the bitcoin up in a lightning wallet where chain analysis cannot track those UTXOs offchain. \n\nWith Chainanalytics exchanges and regulators are using probabilistic guess work in tracking transactions onchain. They merely assume your withdraw address likely belongs to you. By sending the bitcoin from wallet A to wallet B within a few hours you are creating plausible deniability and adding in significant doubt those UTXOs(bitcoin) belong to you and doing so in such a small window that the price change is moot to avoid creating a taxable event. At any time in the future you can privately spend the bitcoin or sell it for fiat in a private manner. \n\n>Other than cash, what other ways are there to buy/get crypto without ID, if you don't mind sharing?\n\nmany ATMs don't require ID and just sms verification - coinatmradar.com\n\nOther options are any way that doesn't require verification like this list -\n\nhttps://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges\n\nYou can also get bitcoin for selling a good or service , mining bitcoin , using a DEX , p2p for cash",

That is the key to access your coins. You can use any wallet you want that uses bip39. You can even use the same keys on multiple wallets if you want. All the wallets do is give you an interface to access your funds on the blockchain. You want to be very careful where you type in or have your private key/phrase located.",

Otherwise, being a public blockchain would go against that. What Bitcoin doesn't require is for you to provide your name and address in order to own a wallet and start owning and trading Bitcoin.\n\nIt is free because Bitcoin does not require you to participate with exchanges - these are \"middlemen\" which are only a recent phenomena, and normally fall under particular jurisdictions and so have to play by their rules.\n\nAnd that is what happens when decentralisation interacts with centralised ecosystems. And so if you don't like your localised area's rules and requirements, that's you're responsibility to resolve and not Bitcoin's. You can avoid doing KYC by simply not dealing with exchanges, and instead trade via P2P and over the counter trading. Governments cannot control your (hardware) wallet.\n\nIf people instead decide they want the full benefits of centralisation and so are fine to do KYC then that is also their right. The point of decentralisation is that it is up to the individual to choose.\n\nIt's not even relevant what Satoshi originally wanted, and he has voluntarily given up control.",
