Make sure you pay yourself in cash even if its just a hundred bucks here and there. \n\nThen once that well dries up, chill with your money and wait until something similar happens with another crypto. This bear market will probably claim a few more victims. But don't start eagerly branching out into strategies you don't know, or start thinking its easy money everywhere. \n\nJust become a dead shitcoin volatility specialist lol.\n\nThe idea is you want to find a little edge like that and then push it hard. You don't need more strategies or more trades, just one simple thing that works and just beat it into the fucking ground until it doesn't work anymore.",
