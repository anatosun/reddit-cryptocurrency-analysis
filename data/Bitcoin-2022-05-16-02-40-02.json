No, I am not going to track down their identity for you, that's your job.  Look?  Check my bank records, I see no random income equating to that transaction so like I said.  I donated it off to a stranger and am no longer affiliated to those coins.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPart two ensures part one is not readily discovered 3 days later as an income at the same total value, thus revoking your plausibility.  This is not tax evasion as you would *eventually* have to declare income at present price point (much steeper than long term gains) if you were to ever sell bitcoin for fiat.  So if your theory is bitcoin wins after the collapse of fiat, you'll be paying your taxes in bitcoin anyway.  If your theory is bitcoin rides along side fiat, you will eventually have to cash bitcoin in to fiat to pay taxes and thus would have wanted to be declaring tax events on every transaction leading up to that point.  So it all anchors to what your long term strategy is and completely coincides with obeying local and federal laws without any fraud whatsoever.  You are simply either extending or shortening your time-preference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnless a completely unethical tax on unrealized gains is implemented, in which case.... severe.... changes.... need to exist in that theoretical government tyranny.  Tax on unrealized gains is outright theft, there's no other way to look at it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: to note, OP said he's used central exchanges to purchase all bitcoin anyway... There's literally no reason to keep those utxo separate as they're all KYC to him anyway.... Sending them all to one new wallet is just to add one tiny little shred of layer and push out the timeline a bit.  He's already kyc to that lump some of addresses at the purchased price point.",
