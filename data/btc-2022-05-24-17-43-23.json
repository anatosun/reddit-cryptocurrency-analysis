Nah - if a blockchain being used by most of the world can still be rolled back by 1 year, Bitcoin might as well be considered dead.\n\nSo i don't think Bitcoin needs to get a \"protocol change\" ever to optimize for future large block storage.\n\nI think each miner will naturally prune their data to keep costs down.\n\n(edit: if 1 year seems short, make it 10 years - no problem)\n\nThe \"incentive\" here is that a miner is not rewarded for keeping ALL the data, because \"pruned\" miners are just as good at validating as \"full\" miners.  \"Just as good\" being 99.9<repeating many many times>%\n\nIn fact, it is not possible to fake a transaction because all the hashes must match up.\n\n(edit: This is where I am going off on a tangent)\n\nCan someone please explain why pruned blockchain is not the \"standard operating procedure\"?

                    "response": "Pruning the blockchain was clearly part of the original scaling solution.\n\nSomeone sends you a txn. A txn includes the txids of its inputs. Your wallet's job is to determine if the inputs are valid.\n\nYour SPV wallet already has all the block headers. Using only these, the wallet can tell that (for example) one input is recent, with only 3 confirmations, and two other inputs are older, with over 24,000 confirmations.\n\nThe older txns can be trusted without further verification. For these to be fake would require the attacker to segment your node and feed it half a year of false proof of work. It's not a feasible attack for a casual peer to peer transaction. \n\nThe recent input would \"only\" require an attacker to fake thirty minutes of proof of work. Maybe that's not good enough. The good news is that this is recent data and hasn't been pruned yet. So your wallet requests the txn details from a pruned node, and discovers (for example) that this txn has two inputs, both buried under a ton of work. Validation is done.\n\nThis is the way Bitcoin was designed to work (as explained in the Bitcoin white paper) and is the sort of thing this community should focus harder on building and perfecting.\n\nI think somewhere along the way the idea crept into Bitcoin that unless the entire history is preserved on every node that the system will collapse. It's a toxic idea. This implies that every \"trustless\" user of the Blockchain in 2122 needs to store and constantly revalidate Bob's coffee transaction from over 100 years prior.\n\nIt's a patently silly idea when you frame it correctly. If proof of work was really that easy to undo or fake, then why are we bothering? The point is that we know that the history *can't* be changed without reworking the entire chain. Once something is sufficiently buried under enough work, we shouldn't waste our time questioning its validity.",

Some pruned nodes, maybe even a majority of pruned nodes, would be fine but we need to keep a full blockchain somewhere.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell if I spin up a new node, then the only way I can create a UTXO set is to trawl through the entire blockchain, transaction by transaction, block by block, following each coin from its coinbase to its final UTXOs. If I don't do that, then I'd need to trust someone else's UTXO set which really just breaks the \"trustless\" part of bitcoin.\n\nFor example, suppose I know you're a new shop with a new pruning node set up, I happen to have known about that beforehand, and I made sure you're connected you only to my node. So I give you the last 12 months of blockchain, plus the UTXO set dated today.\n\nNow, I happen to have an old wallet in which I received 1 BCH (in txA) two years ago which I spent shortly afterwards (in txB). Cunningly I add my 1 BCH to the UTXO set that I send to you - since my spending transaction doesn't appear in the last year of blocks you won't ever know.\n\nNext I create a transaction from the output of txA and pay you. Since your node doesn't have a good UTXO set, you'll accept the transaction, and so I get my coffee for freeeeeeee.\n\nAnd if I want to steal the lambo from you ('cos you're a lambo+coffee shop!), then yeah, maybe I'd need to mine your transaction into a block or six, and keep your node segregated as you say.\n\nSo, a difficult attack, but not impossible. But *way more difficult* if you have downloaded the full blockchain from the very start - as you say in that case I'd need to present many months of proof-of-work to your node (i.e. a blockchain without that txB) instead of just zero to six blocks.\n\nInterestingly, I wonder would this be a good way to attack a POW coin: 1) get some malware into the software which re-adds an old spent output back to the UTXO set; 2) since most (all?) clients trust the UTXO set which they wrote to disk when shutting down and then check only the last few blocks for consistency, then on upgrade time, the 2-year-old output will become de-facto part of the UTXO set going forward.\n\nI can see problems; software like electrum which keeps coin histories would probably catch it, and anyone spinning up a new node or reindexing the blockchain would catch it; so the attack would have a limited lifetime just after a network upgrade or risk severely forking the chain. Crucially, however, the only nodes that can resolve the discrepancy would be full nodes; pruning nodes wouldn't be able to.\n\nAm I making sense?",

If you're running a full archival node and I can segment it, I can reduce the difficulty and send you an entirely bogus blockchain of my own creation. You'll think all your transactions are valid and mined but really nobody else saw them.

                    "response": "> Can someone please explain why pruned blockchain is not the \"standard operating procedure\"? Why is anyone keeping full blockchain data?\n\nBecause our node software have not needed to prioritize this yet, so the pruning we have is very unsophisticated and clients that can fast-sync are really still using their \"own\" protocols to do so. Common specifications for lighter nodes (using UTXO commitments) are still in development (although e.g. BCHD and Bitcoin Verde have implementations of it, but we don't have the on-chain UTXO commitments yet).\n\nThe pruning facilities on BCH nodes that I know are still the old 'Bitcoin Core' variety, which requires validating the complete chain during initial sync, and they keep around the last N blocks (simplifying things a bit). __Therefore, we still need full nodes in order to be able for any nodes to sync from scratch!__ (it's just an implementation deficit)\n\nAgree with you, that should improve, and probably will in time.\n\nAs I wrote in another post, it would be great if pruned nodes could run in a way to form a bittorrent-like swarm so that the pruned node network keeps a complete copy of the blockchain over its distribution if possible. Then, as long as we keep high enough redundancy, we would not even need complete full nodes online in order to retrieve the entire chain. The swarm would provide.\n\nSimilar as to how UTXO commitments are being developed, someone could start a (non-consensus) CHIP for a better pruned node network protocol. Necessary features imo would be to let the user allocate a certain amount of disk space, and the node software would decide which blocks to store in it, based on maximizing availability of all blocks in the network. So it would rebalance itself occasionally as other nodes become available or leave. It would also need to track and exchange this block availability data with other nodes and deprioritize badly behaved peers.",

That's about **$7k** for the EDS3900 on Alibaba (after tax). Gold bugs could claim that a **decentralized gold standard** is more decentralized than Bitcoin, if the full node is too expensive. At an official 39kg, the x-ray machine is probably too heavy to even lift!\n\nInternet is still needed for gold to work, because ppl need to check the gold price to settle the payment (like bitcoin price). The cost of replacing **x-ray tubes**, which probably break down under constant use, might be similar to the cost of adding hard drive space. There's an issue of how long the $7k should last.\n\nA gold standard could work by embedding gold in cash. **10mg** & **100mg** notes are worth **60c** & **$6**, and we can always tip to the nearest 10mg (or else stock loads of 1mg notes, too). I wouldn't bother thinking about silver, or anything else, just gold. [Here](https://www.ebay.com/itm/164961330561?hash=item2668762581:g:0PMAAOSwslNg8IcQ)'s a 0.1g \"Cash Gold\" note, $6 gold selling for $19 (after tax+shipping). Current x-ray machines don't fully work, because it needs to get the weight of embedded gold using an x-ray cross-section technique. However, the machinery might be over-priced, so I figure $7k is a fair number.\n\nSo the question is, if I give you a budget of up to **$6k** or $7k for equipment, how big can the blocks get? Is 6000 TPS possible, like Visa? The EDS3900 does come with a 1 year warranty, so I guess it could last 5 years before replacing it ($6k every 5 yrs, with Moore's law, etc).\n\nTechnically, an x-ray machine is just for verifying, analogous to Bitcoin's SPV verification. However, for Bitcoin to work there has to be lots of full nodes. So I figure the x-ray machine is more analogous to a full node. In the worst case scenario, a merchant could wait a day to clear all cash-gold payments, because they have to run the cash through the bank's x-ray machine (at day's end). It depends how big the payment is! It's the bank's x-ray machine which is the \"full node\".",

Crypto alone is too risky & volatile. The gold-cash is what could back bitcoin & BCH, at some level. We might not want to hold fiat, in order to back crypto. Buying the dip requires holding large sums of fiat, unless we all have (and can easily use) gold-cash (embedded gold in polymer). Imo Gold Cash & Bitcoin Cash could fit together, side by side. Some ppl do hate crypto more than they hate fiat.\n\nThe next reason is that the **internet** could go down. Gold-cash is like a backup. It's like a backup decentralized monetary standard to have cheap x-ray machines and spot priced gold-cash, etc. The internet could go down whenever the gov't wants it to, or if StarLink has a problem, etc. Strictly speaking, gold cash requires we know the approx price of gold, and that doesn't actually require the internet.\n\nHypothetically if gold-cash becomes popular, then comparing the price of a bitcoin node to that of an XRF machine seems reasonable, since both would be needed for decentralization. Like bitcoin requires cheap computers, the decentralized gold standard **requires cheap X-Ray machines**. Like how x-rays would be needed to detect a bullet in someone, they're also needed to detect gold impurities (except the process involves a spectral scan).\n\nMaybe El Salvador could have adopted gold cash instead of, or as well as, BTC. But that's like hopeless, which is why I guess some crypto enthusiasts shorted gold. The reason to literally embed gold in polymer is to **decentralize** the gold standard, since no trust is required. But the Salvadoran gov't can just trust themselves, so there's no point. It's just expensive, especially if engineers overcharge for every detail, etc.",
