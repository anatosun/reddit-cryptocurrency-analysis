                    "response": "Pruning the blockchain was clearly part of the original scaling solution.\n\nSomeone sends you a txn. A txn includes the txids of its inputs. Your wallet's job is to determine if the inputs are valid.\n\nYour SPV wallet already has all the block headers. Using only these, the wallet can tell that (for example) one input is recent, with only 3 confirmations, and two other inputs are older, with over 24,000 confirmations.\n\nThe older txns can be trusted without further verification. For these to be fake would require the attacker to segment your node and feed it half a year of false proof of work. It's not a feasible attack for a casual peer to peer transaction. \n\nThe recent input would \"only\" require an attacker to fake thirty minutes of proof of work. Maybe that's not good enough. The good news is that this is recent data and hasn't been pruned yet. So your wallet requests the txn details from a pruned node, and discovers (for example) that this txn has two inputs, both buried under a ton of work. Validation is done.\n\nThis is the way Bitcoin was designed to work (as explained in the Bitcoin white paper) and is the sort of thing this community should focus harder on building and perfecting.\n\nI think somewhere along the way the idea crept into Bitcoin that unless the entire history is preserved on every node that the system will collapse. It's a toxic idea. This implies that every \"trustless\" user of the Blockchain in 2122 needs to store and constantly revalidate Bob's coffee transaction from over 100 years prior.\n\nIt's a patently silly idea when you frame it correctly. If proof of work was really that easy to undo or fake, then why are we bothering? The point is that we know that the history *can't* be changed without reworking the entire chain. Once something is sufficiently buried under enough work, we shouldn't waste our time questioning its validity.",

                    "response": "> Can someone please explain why pruned blockchain is not the \"standard operating procedure\"? Why is anyone keeping full blockchain data?\n\nBecause our node software have not needed to prioritize this yet, so the pruning we have is very unsophisticated and clients that can fast-sync are really still using their \"own\" protocols to do so. Common specifications for lighter nodes (using UTXO commitments) are still in development (although e.g. BCHD and Bitcoin Verde have implementations of it, but we don't have the on-chain UTXO commitments yet).\n\nThe pruning facilities on BCH nodes that I know are still the old 'Bitcoin Core' variety, which requires validating the complete chain during initial sync, and they keep around the last N blocks (simplifying things a bit). __Therefore, we still need full nodes in order to be able for any nodes to sync from scratch!__ (it's just an implementation deficit)\n\nAgree with you, that should improve, and probably will in time.\n\nAs I wrote in another post, it would be great if pruned nodes could run in a way to form a bittorrent-like swarm so that the pruned node network keeps a complete copy of the blockchain over its distribution if possible. Then, as long as we keep high enough redundancy, we would not even need complete full nodes online in order to retrieve the entire chain. The swarm would provide.\n\nSimilar as to how UTXO commitments are being developed, someone could start a (non-consensus) CHIP for a better pruned node network protocol. Necessary features imo would be to let the user allocate a certain amount of disk space, and the node software would decide which blocks to store in it, based on maximizing availability of all blocks in the network. So it would rebalance itself occasionally as other nodes become available or leave. It would also need to track and exchange this block availability data with other nodes and deprioritize badly behaved peers.",
