They are definitely not fully backed as historically they never were fully backed by dollars, so if large holders try cash out and dont get their cash , the peg between USDT and USD may break as people run for the exits.\n\nAlternatively if they did the same scam as UST and backed their token with Bitcoin and other crypto, they may be forced to sell off their holdings and crash various cryptos by a huge amount.",
