Like all con artists. \n\nCurrently, a simple Raspberry Pi 4 could easily handle the traffic of 32MB blocks. My own testings say that it can handle up to 128MB blocks, and up to 256MB block with some difficulty. \n\nThere have been performance issues, because we inherited the code from small-blockers, but more and more work is being made to improve the performance. \n\nYou will hear people say that non-mining nodes \"secure the network\". They actually do nothing. \n\nCurrently there is not a big demand for BCH's blocks, and we're ok for the immediate future.

BSV decided to make their blockchain just a place to store any arbitrary amount of data. In no time flat the chain was full of weather data and dog pictures.\n\nIt's a strange community with very odd, upside-down ideas about Bitcoin. It's my personal opinion that BS is or was created / supported by certain actors in the BTC community. The reason I think this is because key small block thought leaders had made all kinds of dire predictions about all the awful things that were going to happen when we raised the block size. They also accused us of worshipping Satoshi like a deity. None of these things came true and they're wrong about the worship stuff. We couldn't care less who Satoshi is, what we care about is his idea, and not because it's *his* idea, but because it's the *best* idea.\n\nThen along comes this guy claiming to be Satoshi who creates a fork and LO! like a caricature he creates a fork that manages to do (or try to do) every bad thing that the small blockers incorrectly said we'd do. \n\n\u2705 Bloat the chain with dog pictures\n\n\u2705 Centralized mining\n\n\u2705 Almost no node network\n\n\u2705 Catastrophic chain reorgs\n\n\u2705 KYC mining (miner ID)\n\n\u2705 Strong support for censorship\n\nEtc.\n\nMaybe there was no relationship at all between BSV and the political team controlling BTC but if not then it's got to be the luckiest coincidence for the small blockers that BSV came along and rescued their narrative.\n\nTo be BSV is a meme puffed up buy a billionaire, nothing more.\n\n/u/netinhabitant",

According to them, it either has to be \"infinite\" scale, or you're not scaling at all.  This is of course ridiculous and delusional, but a lot of it comes from Craig Wright and his fake claims to be Satoshi.  There is clearly a sensible middle ground where we increase the blocksize as demand and technology allows, rather than just removing all limits and assuming the chain can handle any amount of bot spam to facilitate pointless \"our blocks are bigger\" boasting.\n\nFortunately, although it was painful, the BCH community was able to kick them out onto their own chain where they can have \"infinite\" scale.  The result has been that their chain has mostly centralised on one company CoinGeek / TAAL run by a guy called Calvin Ayre and Craig Wright.",

They can't sell and recoup the initial investment without crashing the coin to 0 (or close to it). So instead they scramble for reasons to exist.At first they were the \"original BTC\" and going to roll back various upgrades and improvements that had been made.\n\nThen they were the \"banker coin\" that was friendly to government regulation because reasons.\n\nNow they've settled on general data storage I guess?

Therefore there never has been a problem. \n\nTo understand that we need to get into the mechanics of the blockchain. Let me know if this interests you. \n\n\n\n\n>Did BCH find the optimal blocksize for current times?\n\nThe optimal blocksize is what we currently need plus some surplus. As long as blocks are not constantly full the blockchain works perfectly. \n\nBCH is basically surrounded by bad engineering solutions.   \n\n- BTC: 1MB forever! no matter our technical ability.\n- BSV unLiMiTEd BloCkSiZe not matter the technical abilities. \n\nCompare that to BCH:\n\n- As much as we need and can currently technically master.\n\nBCH is the sane scaling approach. \n\n\nThere is a nice image from Mr-Zwets that illustrates this nicely :)\n\nhttps://cdn.rcimg.net/Mr-Zwets/47b38dc9/bf48d9ca240ffcc0facac66c558acbc0.png",
