For example, it might result in privacy becoming a legal requirement in cryptocurrency is the space becomes saturated with banks involvement. Also, this will progress into further need for regulations and regulators will be more involved. More reason why everyone should pay closer attention to privacy solutions, especially on-chain privacy systems, not mixers, that can offer the option to transparent if the need arises. Better to take precautions before such things happen",
