We went from energy independence to going around to dictators with hat in hand begging for oil in less than 2 years. The entire west is committing suicide over these supposedly green initiatives, but they don't actually work. Bitcoiners should be especially wary of environmentalists and ESG types, who are simply using emotional appeals to gain more power. They are happy gas prices are approaching $10 a gallon. That's tantamount to another lockdown. Keep the peasants off the road. They will try to use the same angle to capture/destroy Bitcoin.",

Build-up is usually prelude to conflict. When you do risk analysis, you consider the probability and the consequences, then decide whether to mitigate the consequences, accept them, or not move forward with your actions. I'm saying he should have understood that the build-up on the border meant a higher probability of war, and the consequences that war would have on our energy supply. Maybe he did, and just decided to accept the risk. Or maybe he didn't understand (which would indicate incompetentence) and didn't have any plans for mitigating the consequences. Either way, Biden is the head guy in charge, and ultimately responsible for the impact of the changes that we're seeing right now.",
