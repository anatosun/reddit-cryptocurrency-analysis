            "selftext": "I was wondering if it\u2019s possible at all\u2026 to create some sort of game out of the chaintip to track who\u2019s doing the most, and the winner for the (week) (month) and (year) should win a prize, we should all donate to a price pool with me personally giving 5$ per week 100% to the winners but anybody is welcome to add to the pool. \n\nI think this is a awesome game with fun interaction that will potentially bring new users and holders into the ecosystem during this longggg longgg crypto winter, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll find the price point of BCH desirable enough to hold a few. \n\nI\u2019d love to see this become a thing an an interactive activity that r/BTC can have some fun with, \n\nHow can we figure this out because fundamentally this is the best opportunity to onboard new users to our ecosystem. And I think it most definitely will be a huge success, over the course of 3-6 years. We will gain some. And that\u2019s better than not. Cheers",

I\u2019ll personally pay the prize pools. 20$ monthly, 5$ weekly, and 100$  for the yearly prize.
