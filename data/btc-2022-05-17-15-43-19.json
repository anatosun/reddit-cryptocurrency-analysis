And I think it most definitely will be a huge success, over the course of 3-6 years. We will gain some. And that\u2019s better than not. Cheers",

I can win every week by just doing lots of big tips between sockpuppets I control.\n\nAlso please consider the amount of tipping spam this could create.  As neat as tipping is, we really don't want every single comment followed by a deluge of tip comments.\n\nI would suggest keeping the reward very small so there really isn't a big incentive to win other than getting your name on the leaderboard.  Then there would be less incentive to spam or game the system.   More \"just for fun\" to get on the leaderboard.",

I think the idea of a leaderboard is enough of an incentive to encourage people to tip and a monetary prize isn't necessary and will encourage spamming and getting banned in subs.\n\nStill some of the issues you're mentioning can be potentially solved with some parameters for what counts as an elligble tip towards your score in this contest. Maybe tips are only counted if they're to users who have a minimum amount of karma, one tip per recipient, one tip per sub, only tips above a certain amount, only tips that are actually claimed by a user for the first time etc.\n\nSome combination of these parameters can help prevent spam and gaming the contest.",

That\u2019s a huge win for me and very much so worth the 5$ weekly and 20$ monthly for me. I couldn\u2019t be happier, if we make it a game, more people will catch on and the idea and build like wild fire, exposing cryptocurrency community members that have no idea what the heck BCH is at all. Because they\u2019ve joined in the last year and never even heard or thought about it. \n\nWe gotta think small, and watch how big it gets. I\u2019m on boarding 3-5 new members daily.
