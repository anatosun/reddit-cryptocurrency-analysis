                    "response": "Banks are not places where your money is stored safely. Every single bank in this country is a credit creation institution. For every one dollar you deposit in your bank account, they are allowed to create, at a minimum, nine dollars worth of credit for someone else. This is called fractional reserve banking, and it\u2019s why we are slaves to the banking system.\n\nAt any given time, a bank only has 10% of all deposits on hand. This is what instigated the great depression in the 1930s. People found out there was a money shortage, and they all went to the banks to get their money. Only to find out they were only able to get 10% of their savings. FDIC insurance is not what it seems either.\n\nNot to mention, negative interest rates, where they can charge you money for keeping your money in the bank.\n\nFiat reserve notes are absolutely backed by nothing of intrinsic value, meaning, it is printed from thin air, and is why inflation is out of control.\n\nInflation is a hidden tax. Instead of the government, collecting more money in taxes, they simply print more money. 90% of all federal income tax dollars go to pay the debt on the money borrowed from the federal reserve bank, which isn\u2019t even a federal entity. It\u2019s a private corporation whose owners are private, and part of a foreign corporation.\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg of the corruption. The bankers have the world by the balls, and they always have. World wars have been fought to maintain the central banking structure power, and bitcoin is the biggest threat to their system in the entire history of our civilization.\n\nWe don\u2019t need guns, nor any other weapons to defeat them. We simply need to collapse their power structure, (banking cartel).",
