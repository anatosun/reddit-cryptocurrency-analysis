Right now I'm betting on LRC (and IMX just because of association) since they have just released a pretty nice new trading platform. It's a direct competitor to SmartBCH but oh well.\n\nOn SmartBCH I'm farming with Law and tried DAO but for the last three month everything has gone down faster than the apr payout.\n\nBut literally, I can't find a single token worth investing in really, what are you guys doing?",
