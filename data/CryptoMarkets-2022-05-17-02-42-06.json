The one variable however is the stock market, which he says clearly has an influence over BTC\u2019s price movement. \n\nThe Fidelity analyst says he finds it noteworthy that despite Bitcoin\u2019s significant price correction from its all-time highs, HODLers appear unfazed. His models show that the number of Bitcoin held for more than 10 years is holding steady at 13%.",
