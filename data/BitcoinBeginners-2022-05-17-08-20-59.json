When the lowest sell is lower than the highest buy, a trade happens and the price moves.\n\nDifferent investors will have offers on different exchanges, so they won't ever all have the same price. Traders look for these price differences and buy where it's lower and sell where it's higher. That's called arbitrage, and it causes the prices to converge to similar but not identical amounts.",
