                    "response": "There is no \"official Bitcoin price\".\n\nOn an exchange, buyers and sellers trade with each other, with the exchange being little more than a middleman to facilitate the transaction. Orders to buy or sell are either set with a price limit (a so-called \"limit order\") or to just get the best available price (\"market order\"). If a limit order can't be executed immediately, because there's no counter-order available that meets the price limit, then this order ends up on the order book waiting for counter-orders to match with it. This way, a list of buy and sell orders is populated and when a trader places a market order or a limit order with a price limit that allows it to be matched immediately, the order is executed against opposite orders on the order book.\n\nThe price quoted by an exchange is simply the most recent price at which such a trade occurred.\n\nIf someone places a large market order, it may be matched with a considerable number of counter-orders in the order book and in doing so move the price on that particular exchange by quite a bit.\n\nOther exchanges don't automatically follow this price movement, because they have their own order book and traders. However, if the price of Bitcoin is higher on one exchange than it is on the other, there's an opportunity for profit by buying Bitcoin on the cheaper one and selling it on the more expensive one. This is called \"arbitrage\". The effect of this is that the prices on both exchanges move closer together.\n\nOn all of the large exchanges, traders are actively looking for arbitrage opportunities. They have funds on each exchange and use trading software that automatically spots these price differences and performs the trades. So large price differences between exchanges tend to not last very long. Note that because exchanges charge a fee for trading and withdrawing and because moving funds (especially Dollars) around to rebalance accounts takes time, arbitrage will never fully erase price differences. They just keep them low enough that no easy profit can be made anymore.",

When the lowest sell is lower than the highest buy, a trade happens and the price moves.\n\nDifferent investors will have offers on different exchanges, so they won't ever all have the same price. Traders look for these price differences and buy where it's lower and sell where it's higher. That's called arbitrage, and it causes the prices to converge to similar but not identical amounts.",
