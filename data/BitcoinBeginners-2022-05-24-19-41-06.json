            "selftext": "People keep saying to HODL but I feel like that\u2019s not where the money is at right now. From how I see it, the real money is made IF you are a day trader. Slowly start building your portfolio by taking percentages not holding and hoping. Maybe I\u2019m seeing it the wrong way. I\u2019m in the hole right now because of holding. Yeah trading is riskier but I think I\u2019m going to try that next. I think I\u2019m going in light though because last time I went all in and yeah  im going to have to wait for that to go up lol. Learning my lessons the expensive way \ud83e\udd72 \n\nI\u2019m trying to keep myself leveled enough to not sell while I\u2019m down. I for sure lose if I take it out right. But if I wait I have an opportunity if it going back up sometime in the future. I just don\u2019t know how to keep my hopes up when all I see is red\n\nBut then again everyone says buy when it\u2019s red and sell when it\u2019s green. But that\u2019s tough when the greens are still not good enough to make up for when you bought in. I see why people give up lol this is taxing in many ways \n\nIm trying to be hopeful but it\u2019s getting harder. How do you guys keep hopes up when your portfolio is down significantly? I was doubling down the other week but then I\u2019m like it\u2019s just going to keep going red so I need to stop",

It may be a few years before it moves up, but it also might surprise us and go back up to 60 before the end of the year. All we can be sure of is that bitcoin will almost certainly go up eventually.\n\nIf you trade, you will almost certainly lose, statistically speaking. It was my biggest mistake starting out. I had lost bitcoin and I swore never to do it again, and just started buying. In Jan 2019 the market was just like this,.. long downtrend and then a fat dump to $3.2k. Lots of fear, a lot of people said it was going to $1k. But I bought as much as I could and held it, and still hold 98% of it.\n\nUse this chance to accumulate because bitcoin *will* rise again. It's just a matter of when. DCA strategy never fails in the long run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But then again everyone says buy when it\u2019s red and sell when it\u2019s green\n\nYou are listening to the wrong people. Bitcoiners say buy and hodl. Traders think its foolish, then get rekt, while bitcoiners always win in the long run.",

Maybe I should start investing  in actual assets instead of these highly risky ones. The stock market isn\u2019t doing so well either though :/ \n\nI guess I\u2019ll keep holding because that\u2019s why I got into it. To hold for the future. But the future doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s coming because if the world standing. Life is really crazy. I just want this to go up already so i can rest lol",

Sell into strength on the way up (15% incremental sells dependent on the % you have gained since purchase), then wait until any downtrend starts to reverse before you start buying again. Don\u2019t catch knives and don\u2019t try and time bottoms - just wait for a confirmed reversal.\n\nYea, you\u2019ll miss tops/bottoms but at least you\u2019ll have some profit.\n\nPS appreciate this is kinda irrelevant now. Take it as a learning i guess.",
