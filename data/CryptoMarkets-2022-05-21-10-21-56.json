Crypto people point to the Internets gravitation from a lot of small distributed systems in the early days, to the modern era where the majority of user activity is concentrated in a handful of \"big tech\" enclaves like Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.\n\nBut, if you look at the evolution of crypto, you see the same thing.  We're not \"early\" in crypto any more.  The industry has moved from being P2P, to the point where 99% of most crypto activity is centered around a handful of exchanges.    In reality, crypto is even more centralized than the things it says it's trying to fix.",
