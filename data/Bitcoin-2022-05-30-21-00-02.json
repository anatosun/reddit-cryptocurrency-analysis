So now every so often I check the price of the two and have myself a little chuckle. They don\u2019t bring up crypto anymore. \nHad 1 friend who listened, he had 6 btc when it was about 50k (before 69k peak) and he yeeted 5 of them into yield farming gambling, said he only needed 1. \nLost basically everything.

However, all these different digital tokens are not going anywhere, there will be a constant stream of new ones. Digital 'things' are always going to exist from this point forward. We have to accept this to be the case. And to be fair, a few (perhaps a tiny fraction) of those digital tokens probably have a serious use case in certain narrow (possibly centralised) situations.\n\n As much as we hate all those scam cryptos the real enemy is CBDCs, they are the ultimate scam.\n\nI feel the real risk of all those tokens and coins you are hating on is that they sully the name of Bitcoin in the eyes of the ignorant. Centralised authorities will seek to leverage ignorance to promulgate anti-Bitcoin propaganda as they attempt to enslave people in the panopticon of CBDCs.  \n\n\nThe 'shitters' as you put it are like flies, you can kill as many as you want but there will still be more and they keep coming back.

It always starts as the marketing for one new shitcoin and then a half million followers try to produce the same thing.

Then there was a wave of DAOs and other decentralized apps. In 2017 it was deafining with ICOs... Absolutely inescapable bullshit every channel you watched 24/7...\n\nThen last year came Defi and NFTs, despite bitcoin doing both of those tasks itself years and years ago... They've run out of marketing angles and are just copying bitcoin at this point; it can exist in web3 as that money just fine.",

That no matter what each cycle will result in gamblers wanting to relive or at the very least capture some of what Bitcoin does every cycle, and will forever be chasing the next big thing, because they simply cannot accept that Bitcoin will always be king and they aren\u2019t late.\n\nThis cycle top from last cycle low, 4 years, resulted in over 2000% returns. That\u2019s incredible. It might not have been previous cycle returns, but it\u2019s still incredible. But that\u2019s not good enough for gamblers, for shitcoiners. They want to hit the lottery. Too bad for them it won\u2019t ever happen. Either jump on the bitcoin train, enjoy your losses chasing shitcoins, go join WSB and lose it all on YOLO FDs, or give up and make 15% on SPY to lose to inflation. The choice is yours.",
