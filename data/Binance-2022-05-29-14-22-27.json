            "selftext": "I'm using the binance API from Python to place spot orders, I've noticed a difference between how much I expect to receive and how much I receive.\n\nFor example I want to trade 1000 ADA with the pair ADA/BTC with a value of 0.000016. I've got a standard account without BNB fee discount, so the fee should be 0.10%\n\nNew_btc_amount = (1000 * 0.000016) * 0.999\n\nOtherwise if I want to trade 0.01 BTC in the same pair I do:\n\nNew_ada_amount = (0.01 / 0.000016) * 0.999\n\nAm I missing something? Is there a round problem? How can i calculate this with more precise results?",
