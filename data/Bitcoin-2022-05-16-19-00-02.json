It's always possible to predict the likelihood of that, because the hashrate of your own hardware is known, the current difficulty level is known, and the average time at which last x blocks were mined is known. From the last two you can deduct the current overall hashrate and what % of that your own hardware has, and that's your likelihood of finding the next block. It has nothing to do with what mining pool you are pointing your hashrate to (or I might misunderstand your question).",
