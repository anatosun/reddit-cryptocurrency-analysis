It's always possible to predict the likelihood of that, because the hashrate of your own hardware is known, the current difficulty level is known, and the average time at which last x blocks were mined is known. From the last two you can deduct the current overall hashrate and what % of that your own hardware has, and that's your likelihood of finding the next block. It has nothing to do with what mining pool you are pointing your hashrate to (or I might misunderstand your question).",

In the future when block rewards are smaller, transactions will need to be funded from fees paid by the sender. There is likely to be a minimum cost per transaction that rules out moving amounts of money smaller than a few hundreds of dollars. You'll always be able to send your coins, but you'll spend most of them in fees in the process. Best to keep your coins in a few big wallets.\n\nHow much will fees be in the future? Impossible to know, but likely to be non-negligible.

If you want a fair society, you need more trustless parallel systems like #bitcoin, not less\n\nPeople lose their liberties to the endless vindictive tug of war over retaliatory intervention and paternalism,because they were so fickle so lacking in integrity & ethics they weren't willing to be charitable, fair, principled to rules initially. This is precisely what btc fixes\n\nbitcoin is largely idiot proof, almost exclusively engineered to resist the stupidity of the masses. It is the epitome of an anti-thesis of the concept of protecting people for their own good. Politically neutral, uncorruptable, and equally accessible, unlike anything in society.",
