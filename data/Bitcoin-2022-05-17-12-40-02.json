So customers can pay them with BTC without any intermediary. That's already a pretty advanced way to receive Bitcoin.\n\nWithout this kind of infrastructure (which helps with more than just receiving Bitcoin), you can still use Bitcoin wallets and preferably ones that support the Lightning Network (Electrum, Phoenix, Eclair, etc.) to pay in a Peer-to-Peer manner. In other words directly from your wallet to the person you want to pay. All they have to do is press \"Receive\" on their wallet, show you the QR code of their address and you scan it with your wallet. Again, no intermediary that can block this.\n\nAs to whom accepts to receive Bitcoin in exchange for food, I would guess necessity is the mother of invention, when your government is oppressive or irresponsible with your country's currency you will find ways to escape this.

One that is out of the reach of their government's control too.

If ASICS become targets for malicious actors. Difficulty adjusts as required, so if ASICS get taken out then we can GPU mine until ASICS come back. If all GPUs get taken we can use CPUs, if there are no CPUs, GPUs and no ASICs left functioning in the world then I guess we've got bigger problems than bitcoin.\n\nIf ASICS are turned by a malicious actor to actively attack Bitcoin (in some kind of extremely clever, coordinated attack) then the nuclear option is to change the hashing algorithm from SHA256 and turn all bitcoin ASICS into expensive, ugly bricks. But that is a last resort.",

It's now obviously up to you in the generational lineage to make better decisions going forward.\n\nUnfortunately all you made so far is a shitty cartoon blaming smarter and more successful generational lineages for the shortcomings of your own.\n\nIf you really do want to make a difference in your impoverished community, stop lashing out at others and projecting blame and hate. Start working with them and you'll find there are lots of financially 'privileged' people willing to share the fruits of their ancestors to help fix the shit decisions of yours.\n\nWould you consider people who have access to medicine to be medically 'privileged'? Medical knowledge comes from hard work, applied intellect, and coordination amongst society members. Plenty of organizations work to share medical as well as financial assistance to those more needy.\n\nYour use of the word 'privileged' is misguided and inappropriate as is the case for all lamesteam media brainwashed NPCs.
