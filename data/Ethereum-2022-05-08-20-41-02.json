            "selftext": "I basically only stake ETH using Lido built into Ledger Live.  During low gas times (around 20gwei) you can stake with Lido using Ledger live for about $6 - $8 in gas fees.\n\nThe research I have been doing says I need to move to an L2 as most of retail will only use those in the future.\n\nI decided to give it a try tonight.\n\nI transferred $100 to my Ledger Nano S+ and connected it to MetaMask.  I then went to Arbitrums site and deposited the $100 of ETH into the L2 using the bridge.  Gas was around $7 (22 Gwei) at the time.  So I ended up with $93.  \n\nThat was successful and I now show $93 of ETH on the Arbitrum network on my Ledger connected to MetaMask.\n\nI then went to Uniswap, connected my wallet to the Arbitrum network and swapped ETH for rETH.  The fee was only $0.65.  It would have been $24 if I had done it on the mainnet.  So 36x cheaper than the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nSo this may not have been the best test as I could have staked with Lido for roughly the same gas fees and it\u2019s much easier using the ledger live interface, but I wanted to learn how to move to an layer 2.\n\nIt does get me very excited for the potential of the ethereum ecosystem when Layer 2s are the go to for retail investors and we don\u2019t have to interact with the layer 1 directly anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously still early days and it\u2019s needs to be a little easier before mass adoption happens, but I know that will come in time.\n\nI really like that I can still do it all using my Ledger and not have to give up on using a hardware wallet.\n\nThat\u2019s my story for my fun filled Saturday night!",

Completely new to this world, I have gone through most of the cryptozombies lesson on solidity while also trying to understand the overall concepts of Blockchain/Web3, what major projects are doing etc etc...\n\nThe project will basically be a way to truly enable digitally signing and reliably storing important documents. As of now I see this being used by corporates/ governments etc (Yeah I overstretched by adding govt). Docs like contracts, agreements, bills etc\n\nThinking of using Ethereum + Filecoin, since I am targeting security over other features. It might be better to go with something like Hyperledger, but I am thinking this should be compatible with multiple chains anyway to provide different options for users based on the need of security, performance, gas fees etc. So I will be starting off with Ethereum.\n\nPlease let me know if you see any implications and problems ahead. My major objective of posting this is to have a brainstorm of potential issues I might face in future. Also get some help in moving forward with the project. What I should learn? What I should know before starting of etc etc?  \nAlso are there other subReddits which are more apt for these kind of questions?  \nAny comment is appreciated.\n\nThanks",

Dai shot up to like $1.10.\n\nSince then, MakerDAO has added lots of changes to support the peg, one of the main ones being the \"Peg Stability Module\", which uses USDC to stabilize the peg.\n\nDai gets criticized a lot for being \"centralized\" for using USDC in the system. However, I think using an on-chain mechanism that uses USDC is a lot more decentralized than UST, which has Jump Capital counter-trading to maintain the peg and the Luna Foundation Group purchasing Bitcoin that the company can sell to backstop the peg.",

It doesn\u2019t matter if it maintains its peg within 0.01% of the real price during *regular days* if the system fails catastrophically when the market melts down. Invest in stable coins that proved themselves on Black Thursday (covid crash when the market lost 50+% within 24hrs) such as DAI and USDC. We have no need for 30 different ones which are mostly owned by VCs, are highly centralized in their consensus, operate on fractional reserves, and/or have yet to demonstrate they can survive the high volatility of massive bull and bear swings. \n\nPlease think about that. I urge you guys to please just invest in the ones that have proven themselves time and time again: DAI and USDC. They\u2019re all worth $1 regardless - so please just go with the safest option.",

Some might say 7% is unsustainable, but I think that ideally (in a healthy market) the interest rate should at least match inflation. Couple this with the efficiency gains of automating many of the currently analogue processes of traditional finance and I think that the crypto exchange banks are here to stay. FDIC insurance will prove to be a brilliant shelling point for the masses.\n\nTLDR: GUSD has my blessing. \ud83d\udc4d",
