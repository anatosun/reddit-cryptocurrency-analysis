You account can never be compromised the way a bank account can.\n\nAlso, these crypto payments services are becoming faster and cheaper by the day to the point where some crypto payment services like e-money offer lightning fast transactions are near zero fees.\n\nThis is the kind of convenience that will drive people to slowly but surely end up adopting crypto payments in order to secure and more private and assure themselves a method of payment without ever having to worry about the account being undermined.",
