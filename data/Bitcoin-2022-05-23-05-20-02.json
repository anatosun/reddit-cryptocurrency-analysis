And this was posted in 2018!\n\nOf course Bitcoin is going to be volatile while it's in the early adoption phase. It's only after we will reach mass adoption is where we will reach actual price discovery. This is so obvious.\n\n\nIt's like saying the internet wouldn't work because in the early days we used to get constant disconnections and a slow downloading speed. - Yea dude, but then 2 decades of evolution went by of humans expanding and improving the internet infrastructure. Guess what? We managed to get a much more stable and ridiculously faster internet.  \n\n\nBoring",
