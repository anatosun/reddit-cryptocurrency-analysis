As long as we as humans have the will to hold and buy, markets and currencies will recover eventually.\n\nFor now though, I sold because this year is definitely gonna be the big bad crash we've been waiting for there's no way it doesn't fucking happen. Things will spike probably starting next week and go up cartoonishly for 2-4 months, then I expect it's all going to crash starting around December.

So much of the asset price inflation has to do with ultra-wealthy banks and companies getting handed money (during QE) at extremely low interest rates.  They used that money to purchase their own stock and then when they saw that is what everyone was going to do piled their own money into it as well.  Now those low interest rates times are gone and everyone is looking for an exit because there is no more free money to purchase assets and keep the asset prices rising.  The selloff will likely be overdone and during that time the rich will start feeling poor and will lay off a bunch of people and really make them poor.  Crypto price is following partly because people expect it to and partly because the assets were purchased from the same sources which will dry up a bit.  FOMO turns into fear of holding the bag.",
