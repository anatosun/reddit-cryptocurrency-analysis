My main guess as to why it hasn\u2019t- those MtGox coins, all 800k of them, probably ended up in the hands of someone who values control of the markets over the value of the tokens themselves. That\u2019s the only reason I think the price is as low as it is now. The circulating supply must be greater than we think.",

If I weren't so chicken I'd probably go long a little (perhaps **2x**).\n\nSomeone could put out a **spam alert** on BCH. It just went from **0.3 TPS** to **1.7 TPS** overnight, with no apparent increase in actual usage. 0.3 TPS was a standard baseline over many days. Someone's spamming BCH. If it goes on and on for weeks it can cause a Pump-n-Dump, because buyers see BCH as cash, and \"obviously\" more TPS means possibly more usage (whereas less TPS means less usage is *guaranteed*).",
