You connect it to their wallet service or pair it with a compatible wallet of your choice. For exemple, I love the Exodus UI so I paired my Trezor to it. I can check my funds on my phone and have an Exodus wallet with less funds if I want to spend it, but it also shows me my Trezor protected funds. I can check my portfolio thru there and can get my key to receive coins but would need to go on my Trezor and PC to send some. Some Ledgers can connect to your phone instead of PC.",
