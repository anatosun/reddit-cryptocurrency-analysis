You connect it to their wallet service or pair it with a compatible wallet of your choice. For exemple, I love the Exodus UI so I paired my Trezor to it. I can check my funds on my phone and have an Exodus wallet with less funds if I want to spend it, but it also shows me my Trezor protected funds. I can check my portfolio thru there and can get my key to receive coins but would need to go on my Trezor and PC to send some. Some Ledgers can connect to your phone instead of PC.",

On the other hand, the Ledger is neither air-gapped nor opensource, you just got to trust them.\n\nIf he doesn't feel convinced, just explain that exchanges can do anything with your money, atleast on a wallet, you have the private keys. You can move your funds to another wallet anytime if anything happens.",
