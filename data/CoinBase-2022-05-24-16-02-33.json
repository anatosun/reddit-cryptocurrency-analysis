I purchased BTC without any issues but now when I click on 'Send/receive' it says my account is restricted, but I can still make purchases I just can't send anything. I tried to call Coinbase international number/US, but now it says they only help U.S based clients, and there is no ticketing system for Colombia, it just now says 'Self-Help'. how am I going to unrestrict my account on my own? I don't even know why it was restricted in the first place, I used it just fine last week. I have my money there and would like to withdraw it, how can I do that, so that I can cancel the account afterwards? I no longer trust coinbase, I will be using a different platform. This is URGENT, please provide support.",
