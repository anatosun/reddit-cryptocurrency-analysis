In every aspect of crypto, people wish they bought sooner, when it was low, but now that the market is low, where is that sentiment gone? Eventually, at some point in the future, might be days, weeks, months or years, it will be back up, and at that point you'll be sitting there again, wishing you'd bought sooner. It doesn't necessarily make sense to buy when the market is rising, because yeah, you'll make little gains, but you risk buying at peaks (which is what is happening). Although in the end, DCA is the best way to minimise loss and maximise profit. \n\nPersonally I'm not a doge supporter - I didn't think it would go much beyond 0.15 let alone be heading towards a full $1. The market cap numbers say that it shouldn't go much further beyond that $1, but with enough memeage and media coverage, it could. I'm bullish on ETH, VET and ADA, and yet I'm sure doge will be up again at some point.",

You will accumulate more coins then you had prior to selling and lower your cost per dollar average, allowing you to hold the line longer without feeling anxious. Then when the price rebounds, you will have profited on the downtrend of the market. I\u2019ve increased my holdings by 40% doing this and dropped my cost average by 30%.",

If lot of attempts are made eventually one of them will get lucky and find the solution, and you only get the reward if you find the solution regardless of the work done.\n\nSo the larger pool you have the better chance of getting the reward and actual payment.\n\nIt's a weird and inefficient way to do it, but you can statistically say that no fraudulent transactions can exist for more than a few blocks this way.",

They'll be new people who aren't used to the ups and downs of crypto, but they'll get used to it. I've pretty much got a handle on it already and I've only been doing this a couple of months, so give them a chance.  \n2. Really they're already punishing themselves by selling at a loss or a small profit then seeing the price rebound way higher than they expected.  \n3. They're not the problem. It's the whales dumping and basically bullying them into thinking that they have to cut their losses.  \nSo instead, I suggest we go easy on them, people make mistakes, commiserate with and advise them assuming they want to continue with Doge. After all, the more of us that are doing it right, the more we take from the whales. Who knows, maybe we can take enough that one of them vaguely notices..!",

Also Elon is no fool, people have betted against him before and lost.  No other coin is getting as much coverage.  I am not stupid enough to think what is in it for him. But he also has a lot to loose  and I don't mean financially.  All he has to do is say he will accept it as payment for Tesla and that is another jump.   As I said I think it is only a matter of time for doge to get to $1 I remember people saying it will never get to .25 or .5.  I am not saying it is completely rational, but normal rules don't apply here.  When enough people get together with determination,  resilience and unity then anything is possible my friend.  What you see here is an example of people making collective decisions for the long term benefit of the mass. Where their is unity and passion here is power.",

Don't waste your life savings on any stock, there's always a chance it will crash, bad. If you won't get hurt by burning that amount of money, invest that instead.\n\n2. Never sell at a loss when you've bought in. You only ever lose when you actually sell at a loss. Keep holding and sell only when you gain a profit, hold if you believe it will go higher, that's why most people are here.\n\n3. Treat the market like a casino. This will give you an idea of the stakes. Never keep buying to make up for a loss, you're going to spiral into a gambling addiction. Back to tip #1, only invest money you can afford to lose. Don't invest money meant to go to your bills.",

Just like the stock market people cash out that need the money. In crypto , it's got to be sold and changed back to your countries currency and then you can have your dream house or your new car.
