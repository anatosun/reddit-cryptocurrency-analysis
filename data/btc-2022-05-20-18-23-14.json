Because of the volatility of crypto and because price on the market can be absolutely anything, no stablecoin without fiat currency or other real world assets can survive.

Your conclusion could be spot on for all I know, but going only by your statement I'd have little reason to come to that conclusion.  You could just as well have said you didn't believe people landed on the moon unless the broadcast was audited by someone you trusted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be clear, though, you can save your breath trying to convince me that tether is bad...I don't really have an opinion on it at all since I haven't paid enough attention to form one, though to the extent that I do care about it I tend to agree with you.  I think all of these crypto pop-ups capitalizing on the concept without bringing anything meaningful to the table are overall dragging the community down, and when it crashes it's going to make the solid coins look as bad as the shitty ones.",
