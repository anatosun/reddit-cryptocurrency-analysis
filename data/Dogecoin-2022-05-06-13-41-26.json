Interest rates are climbing - usually the time when investors put their money into either gold or bonds buuuuut they aren't going for digital gold. Instead crypto is following the market - just the opposite of what a store of wealth vision would predict.\n\nSo is that it for crypto? No. Crypto can work as a currency. Preferably a currency with a cute dog as a logo.\n\nWe now have three models in front of us:\n\n* natural inflation that the fed is trying reign in and not succeeding\n* Artificial deflation in the form of limited supply - which isn't operating as predicted\n* Artificial, controlled, inflation at about 4 percent - DOGE\n\nStill betting on DOGE. I think 4 percent inflation rate is about right.",

Dogecoin isn't going to have the same dollar value as bitcoin, but over time it can rise again. Before the 2021 rally, the last time dogecoin had a sudden jump in dollar value was from March to December 2017 ($0.0002 to $0.019. Roughly a 9400% increase). We may have to wait a long while before we see something like that again, but it's not impossible",
