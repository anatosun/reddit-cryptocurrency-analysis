            "selftext": "I have been doing a lot of reflection about my stance towards the bitcoin price. I realised that me cheering for the price to go up is actually counterproductive to my goals.\n\nOnce you have been sufficiently orange pilled and put in your 100+ hours, you realise it's not about short term gains, but stacking as many sats as humanly possible.\n\nOnce all of this comes together your time horizon switches from months to years to decades.\n\nSo if your plan is to accumulate as much BTC as possible, isn't short term growth in the price a bad thing? While it's a good thing for the network and adoption, it's counterproductive to you stacking sats.\n\nThe one thing keeping me up at night is knowing I can't buy more BTC at a low price. I pray for a 1-2 year bear market where I can silently build up my stack. I'd rather DCA at 15-30k than at 60-100k.\n\nI know a lot of people have already figured this out, but I think maybe some haven't, given the obsession over the day to day price on reddit and news articles.\n\nConclusion: If you're truly long term on the Bitcoin technology and macroeconomic potential, a long drawn out bear market is a gift.",

If you want quick hyper growth you need to find a shitcoin and pray to your lucky stars. If you want to be wealthy long term you need to put in your 100+ hours in bitcoin and just stack it. Then don't look at the price at all. As Michael Saylor says your time horizon needs to be at least 4 years.",

Not saying your journey will be similar, but if a crystal ball had told me this last year I would've paced myself with the buys a lot more. I think patience is key, and over time you will stop caring about the prices so much and just focus on the size of your BTC stack. In another 12 months my stack will likely be even or in profit which is still more interesting than the interest my bank's saving's account would give for this money.\n\nThis is tongue in cheek but I think of stacking BTC like grinding in an MMO for a special unique currency that will get you an exclusive legendary item eventually that unlocks some quality of life feature on your character (like not having to upgrade your armor ever again). Of course there are no guarantees in how this will play out, but what is life if not a boring grindy ass MMO? They invalidate your hard work every expansion by making your gear obsolete and inflating the in-game gold, tell you it's gonna be awesome next time to keep you playing and giving them your money...

Bitcoin goes up consistently as the world adopts it, so in years time you won't care what your balance is today. All that matters is how many sats you have.\n\nIn regards to the MMO analogy I think it's very astute. At this point in time as well as the previous 13 years, Bitcoin is more like an insider thing, almost an easter egg based on intelligence and luck. If you managed to find out about it, and you're intelligent enough to truly understand computer science and economics, you would know to buy it.\n\nThese players will then be greatly rewarded before it's in the official patch notes from the devs (think US government endorsing it or something similar), in which all the plebs will buy into it at much higher rates.\n\nIt will unlock quality of life features. The feature will be a life of great quality. You've managed to accumulate wealth in the greatest asset humanity has ever created, and you'll be able to rent it out to other people, and live comfortably at even single digit interest.\n\nAs a true player you also realise that not only are the devs in on it to enrich themselves, but they're actively stealing from the player base through expansionary monetary policy which drives monetary inflation. Everything gets cheaper and faster to produce, but gets more expensive, and your money becomes worth less. The ultimate benefactor here is the devs themselves, since it becomes cheaper and cheaper to pay back it's own loans. The biggest obstacle here is getting the devs to change something which would be bad for themselves. It's obvious to see why no change happens.\n\nLife is one grindy ass MMO. But it's a rewarding one, especially for people that understand it. Get a descent job, start your own business, put away 10-20% of you income and invest it into Bitcoin. Stay strong and HODL.",
