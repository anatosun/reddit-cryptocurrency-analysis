He argues that the narrative of crypto being used as an inflation hedge has also really set us back because BTC hasn\u2019t performed well in inflationary times. Sassano believes that Bitcoin is going to keep losing dominance and keep losing the narrative battle.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Aka not necessarily *short term*.\n\nAgain, no one can reasonably claim crypto is a place where you should put your emergency savings, because it's volatile short term. \n\nAnything that isn't for short term or emergency funds can be used in other ways, like in long term investments, like what crypto offers.",
