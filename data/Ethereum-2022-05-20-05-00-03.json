This decentraziled distributed ledger network provides trust for mulit parties in multi purposes. Cbdc, sytheic shares, token, transactions, and of course pay. .. giben that most big problems in our present world lead back to centralized entities, taken abusive advantage of their superiour power, and smaller entities seeking for a fair escape or option to that dominance, the field of usge for an establishes powerful neutral entitiy/network is indeed gigantic. That is what the world needs right now more than ever before. now: why eth snd not solana etc? .. well, decentralized network are not only a question of technical challenges. Its also a question of growing trust of a community which supports this network. .. and this comes only along by time and dignity if the commiting devs, coin holders, investors etc.. and this comes only by time.. and eth simpy is the one oldest which grew mature to reliable stage. .. the upcoming merge is the one major milestone to become the most powerful network.. proofing eth is logic, is reasonable, reliable and taking responsibilites to its vision and expectations..",
