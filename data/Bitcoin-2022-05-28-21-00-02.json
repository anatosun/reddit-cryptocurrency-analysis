Instead, they fear-monger, and go in hard with the doomsday narrative, in order to keep people scared and, ultimately, compliant. \n\nDon't take my word for it. Do your own homework. \n\nI recommend listening to Professor Freeman Dyson, who was Professor Emeritus at the Princeton Institute of Advanced Studies. \n\nHere\u2019s a good interview with him, before he passed away.

EVs emit less CO2 per mile driven than a gasoline car, because it's more efficient and cleaner to generate electricity on the grid than to produce energy in a traditional ICE engine.\n\nThere are very few if any zero emission grids.\n\nAlso, Bitcoin mining is not replacing anything else. It's totally new load and emissions. Every electric car is replacing a gasoline car, resulting in a net reduction in CO2 emissions.\n\nSo no, they are not idiots.
