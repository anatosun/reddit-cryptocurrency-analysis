So, by giving them USD50, they\u2019d only give me the equivalent of USD39 in BTC.\n\nIs a 20% commission the norm or are there exchanges with lower commissions? Also flexible with the minimum USD to exchange?",

No matter where the bitcoin come from (Exchange, ATM, peer to peer). \n\nThis example is just valid for a very newbie, because a wallet do not store your bitcoin but the private keys, but it helps to understand there is no relationship between wallets and exchanges, like there are no between garage and car sellers. \n\nI don't know where did you buy bitcoin, but in a ATM (the most expensive way) fees are from 5%-15%, so 20% is unsually high. \n\nWhat wallet are you using? where are you buying? Do you have the private keys for your wallet or it is a wallet managed by third-parties?",
