Their only customers are people who have no idea what they're buying except that it's an line item of symbols and an icon, on their browser.\n\nCoinBase is one of these zero due-diligence customers to crypto scams, since they rake transactions and don't suffer any loss when everyone realizes that one acre of oceanfront property in the middle of the Sahara desert can't find any buyers for more than 1/100 billionth of a penny, for speculators in the infinitesimal chance is something there and a greater fool comes around next month to buy it.\n\nWhen the federal government comes around to understanding exactly what is happening. They're going to pass a law saying you can't help teenagers sell people real estate on the moon with your binance exchange. If you want to buy those things you have to go through proper channels, such as, but not limited to lottery tickets at your local gas station, or baseball cards.  Moneyminting systems already fully rigged, raked and taxed by the government.\n\nOnly 5% of the cryptocoins offered for trade by Coinbase have blockchains.  Which ones those are is an exercise for the buyer.",
