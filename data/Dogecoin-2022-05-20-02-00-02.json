If your exchange isn\u2019t on the list, then any price movements you may cause will not propagate outside the exchange.\n\nWhich of course is great for arbitrage. But if you get the price to $1 on an untracked exchange, nobody else will ever know about it.\n\nAnd last time I looked, RH wasn\u2019t one of the 400-odd tracked exchanges. So yes, this is good advice, but for the wrong reasons.",
