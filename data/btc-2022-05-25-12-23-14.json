                    "response": "> The two most popular cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin and Ethereum. Till today, a lot of people still argue about which is better between the two.\n\nIt's true, but the discussion is far from limited to those two.\n\nVery strong arguments can be made that neither one of them are able to work as a cryptocurrency, simply based on their transaction fees.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, it wasn't really designed as a cryptocurrency, but it could be a platform for hosting protocols that have currency characteristics.",
