Give them a few dogecoin.\nMaybe you see an insightful post that helped you understand something better? Give them a few dogecoin.\nMaybe you see a charity you'd like to donate to.

It\u2019s sense of humor just make it feel more accessible to the masses.   \n\nThey stopped making $500 snd $1,000 bills because no one used them.  People will not be as likely to use their more expensive coins with longer wait times as much as a cheaper fun coin that\u2019s fast.   Buying a luxury car etc while waiting for a 10 minute transaction while you sit comfortably at the dealership is not the same as standing in line at any retail store.. then add any holiday - retailers need faster transaction times.  Dogecoin provides that.  It\u2019s practical use and sense of humor have combined for the best PR I\u2019ve ever seen.      This is my opinion of course and not financial advice...",

Nobody knows when dogecoin will be widely adopted. Even **Elon Musk** doesnt know. (Elon if you reading this can you share this on twitter, thanks bro).\n\nToo many shibes here sharing how much they \"invested\" and for example do not even hold the key to their wallets (no key is not your doge). This is not what our purpose is and it damages our progress. If you own doge on eg robin hood, you are not helping!\n\nIt can take **years** for dogecoin to be back at 1 usd. (Not saying it cant happen sooner). Especially in this environment we are in with rising interest rates.\n\nIf you want to get rich quick using dogecoin. Go somewhere else. Go to wall street bets. But do not waste our time and blame someone else for your mistakes. Dont put money in you cant afford to lose. Period.\n\n#                                             1 DOGE = 1 DOGE",

Love to see Doge leading the charge from a percentage increase perspective but couldn't that just be indicative of the fact that it is easier to move the needle on a coin at .09 vs 30k?

What you ask requires a world wide consensus on what 1 Doge can buy and that 2 Doge can buy and etc....  I want a bottle of coke.  Let's say that is 1 Doge.  Go to Italy and that same bottle is 1 Doge.  Anywhere you go it is 1 Doge.  But does that happen?  No.  Each seller of that bottle determines what they sell it for based on what they paid for it or how much profit they want based on the local market.  Now you have 1 Doge in Houston and 1.5 Doge in LA.  So What do you think you can peg the value to in a decentralized currency? There are other challenges besides how you base the value of Doge.  Dont forget the gov always wants their cut.  Cant pay tax in Doge.  I doubt the US Gov will ever allow you to pay for taxes in any crypto.  That would show recognition that it is a form of currency and that is the last thing they want to do.  They want to treat it like a security.  So you sell in Doge, you have to convert the Doge to fiat to pay your tax on your sales.  Which changes the price in Doge that you sell in to help cover that Tax and the conversion to fiat.  There are a lot of challenges.",

This is something that I\u2019ve accepted, and as I\u2019m down in my portfolio, all I can do is watch.\n\nMy situation may be different from yours, but for me the money invested is not a necessity to me. This helps me relax, bills are paid, and over time, it will recover. \n\nNow think about all of the crypto adoption going on in the world, celebrities, governments, and I know this is a cheesy point, but an entire country is betting a lot of its fortune on bitcoin. Incredibly irresponsible and I don\u2019t condone the amount they\u2019ve spent, as its a country where the peoples needs should be put first. \n\nWith that said, I think there is too much adoption for Btc, Doge etc for them too completely fail. Sure some coins will fail, but strong projects will prosper. \n\nThere is also the point of making that we are super duper incredibly early. Look at the big picture, whales still holding long positions wouldn\u2019t do so if they didn\u2019t believe they will make profits in the future. The reason we see crashes are the whales trying to get rich quick, and they do that successfully.\n\nLook, we\u2019ve got a freaking war going on, gas prices are through the roof. Inflation in the USA is at a 40 year high. Times are tough, and they could definitely tougher, but you have to keep pushing.\n\nFor those in tough financial positions, do what ever you have to do to earn an income. If you have the time to pick up a side-job, do it. Spend your money wisely. You have to be strong, depending on the severity of your situation, you may want to avoid further investments as it is probably going to go sideways/downward for the mean time.\n\n\nHope you enjoyed my thoughts on the situation, I\u2019m no expert so I could be completely wrong but I am confident long-term. Good luck out there  guys.",

Bad things happen. Doge devs gotta work 100x harder then they are during a bear market. I won\u2019t sugar coat it. Right now the entire reason Doge is at 8 cents and not a penny is because of the following. That\u2019s it. Nothing more. Bear markets are when dev teams shine. We will know the answer once it\u2019s over. That\u2019s the only answer regardless of hype boys feeding BS hype or FUD boys feeding BS hype.",

Well it\u2019s a better opportunity than 6 months ago when we were trading at peaks. Certainly crashes are more opportunities for new investors. But be careful with your money and invest in things you believe in, cause when it dips even further, you\u2019ll need to have belief that the stock/crypto will recover. \n\nTL;DR, this could get a lot worse, invest carefully and go outside enjoy some fresh air and close your investing apps for a little.

However at the beginning of 2021 I started getting more serious into understanding crypto and eventually I became a bitcoin maximalist. My wife to this day is sort of a shitcoiner but I managed to convince her to convert her Doge at 0.6 into BTC right after SNL, she hated me at first but now she thanks me and she is in the process of realizing that joke networks are doomed to be absorbed by the dominant player. So Its always a good time to reconsider your position and keep some doge for the memes and to remember all the good and bas times we\u2019ve had on every single elon musk tweet but understand the fiat world is rigged and theres only one hope to stand a chance, Bitcoin. I feel really feel bad of people like the dogecoin millionaire, I believe he is a good person but need to understand better how economic incentives and game theory works, not only wishing Doge will hit the moon because Elon bough Twitter.\n\nI will always love doge and respect it as the true underdog that made it to the top 5, but I sincerely want you to see what\u2019s happening.",

Bitcoin is the gold, Doge is the dollar in the crypto world. The only 3 that matter are thus Bitcoin, Etherium and Doge - as the richest man on earth is also saying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can just say, congrats on the right move with SNL, and encourage you get back to DOGE now at this huge discount ;)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will never aim to become a Barry Shilbert, or George Soros for that matter. I see them as the ultimate versions of greed becoming rich at the expense of the many. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nInvestors like Musk become rich because they add value and create win-win situations for both him and the people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe will go to the moon this year, with a new ATH.",

I've been a sucker for Coinbase Learn and consequently I have lots of ERC-20 tokens in very small denominations which I've held just in case one moons, which never happens of course.\n\nI'd move them off the exchange, but on a day like today, or pretty much any day really, that's infeasible due to gas costs. \n\nEnter Dogecoin - Coinbase doesn't charge for converting small sums like that to Doge and dogecoin's network fees are always low. So a bunch of tokens that otherwise might have been a total loss are now salvageable, thanks to Dogecoin.",
