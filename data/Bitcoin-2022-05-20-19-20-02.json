YOU MAKE BANK.\n\nIf both BTC and Coinbase go up, you lose the option premiums, but hopefully you balance that out with BTC gains.\n\nIf BTC goes down and Coinbase goes up you're screwed, but that seems unlikely, no?\n\nThoughts?",

            "selftext": "I am a Bitcoin consultant, and with a worldwide number of people coming into this new crypto-currency phase, we the redditor's of today are the pioneers of what's to come in its evolution.  We can share ideas, create possibilities, develop concepts. I have such a concept by where one can recruit funds for a particular project. It's called '**1mBTC@aTime**', and works like this.  \n\nSay!,  You are called by a Charitable Society(Ex:Red Cross) and they want to accept crypto-currency at their next event or fundraiser.  They call on you, to fix a QR-code with a payment request of 1milliBitcoin(agreed amount by the customer) that is setup on a display of some sort.  Or you can be called on to setup an admission fee for a particular evening at some nice dance club.  A parking spot for rent to a concert show in your city.  The possibilities are endless!  \n\nObviously, 1mBTC for a parking or admission could be to much, but the amount requested is also variable to suite your customer's need.  You supply the displays, and/or the means, and collect a percentage of the amount generated.  **1mBTC@aTime** is more than just a payment request, it's a way of supporting any project, like a little crowdfunding.\n\nTake project \u2018Off-Grid\u2019 for instance.  An Off the Grid Home, deep in the woods.  With the advent of hyper-inflation, and the imminent fall of global economies, the dream of owning an Off Grid Home is just getting more and more out of reach.  Since, having a mortgage is not very Off Grid Like, one can use **1mBTC@aTime** to creating a funding address for donations.\n\n**1mBTC@aTime** can be your trademark to furnishing a fast growing population of Bitcoin users looking for a way to use their Bitcoins.  By promoting your services, you have an opportunity to make some bitcoin, in either a fixed amount, or as a percentage.\n\n**1mBTC@aTime** can reunite its users to share information, such as, events that might want to try this service.  Support with ideas as, how to furnish the necessary equipment for the task of \u2018accepting or collecting\u2019 Bitcoin funds, and what amounts are best suited for a particular event.   \n\n**1mBTC@aTime** can be in any language, say French... **1mBTC@laFois**\n\n**1mBTC@aTime** users can create, share, backdrops for slapping a QRcode on in publications,(weddings, airshows, conferences, etc.)  And so much more!\n\nJust set up a Key Pair and let the customer hold the private key.  Agree to either a fixed fee or a percentage settlement.  Generate a QRcode for the receiving wallet.  Take a \u2018watch only\u2019 view of the account on your smartphone.  BOOM, your setup!  Supply QRcodes signs where needed and/or train staff if you have to.  You know best what needs to be done to make it happen!  This would probably work better under Lightning Networks.  Damn, the future is coming fast.\n\nSo, what do you think of **1mBTC@aTime**\n\nIf you like. Leave it a thumbs up, or share me a comment below on how the **1mBTC@aTime** concept can work for you!  \n\n[Try it out, see how it works!](https://preview.redd.it/p07ssdaoio091.png?width=225&format=png&auto=webp&s=e672c79521f65839ae5e8d33ee3a90be3674e244)",
