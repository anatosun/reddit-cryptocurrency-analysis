Are you travelling, or is someone else responsible for onboarding these merchants?\n\nDo you think its best to have merchant adoption spread around many different cities and counties, or rather to get adoption much higher in a concentrated area, such as one city or island such as with St. Kitts and Nevis?",

I am being assisted with a couple of friends for some onboarding like 5 percent of what you see I am posting is assistance , or my team \nbut rest are all from me . \nI believe the adoption should be global bcos u should be eventually able to travel with you bch Wallet in anu country or city and be able to spend / use it . Thats the idea / plan / ultimate Goal.. right ? \nSo whenever I am home I call my friends who own businesses around the world and explain them about BCH and how it is so amazing for their business to en Able to accept crypto bcos the globe is going digital and soon  very soon everyone will accept crypto via apps - their current provider etc .. \nthanx for your support bro",
