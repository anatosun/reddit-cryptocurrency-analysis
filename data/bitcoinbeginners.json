As Bitcoins market cap grows and monetary inflation drops it appears that we will likely see very low deflation (occasionally people losing some coins) which is perfectly fine because the market will factor those expectations into consideration for loans and debt.\n________________________________________\nI personally prefer slight deflation for these reasons :\n\n1)\tEncourages people to invest in things they really need instead of unnecessary fluff and short term desires which is good for society and the environment\n\n2)\tencourages more savings instead of debt slavery which removes choice, confidence and power away from individuals\n\n\n3)\tkeeps fiat currency in check where too much inflation will cause more capital flight to Bitcoin and prevents corrupt governments from abusing the backdoor tax of inflation\n\n4) Reduces the negative cantillon effect of fiat by removing some of the control over currency from a small group of people that is in part due to fiat being inflationary\nhttps://fee.org/articles/the-cantillon-effect-because-of-inflation-we-re-financing-the-financiers/",

Since most of this Bitcoin needs to be sold to cover miner costs you have 900 x 41k usd = ~36,900,000 usd worth of Bitcoin that needs to be purchased daily in order to keep the price of  Bitcoin stable . \n\nIn approximately 751 days - https://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/ the amount of Bitcoin per block will be cut in half to 450 new Bitcoin a day or only ~18,450,000 usd of bitcoin needs to support miners at todays current price. \n\nThis means :\n\n1) Bitcoin technically doesn't **necessarily** need new adoption to continue to grow in value . Current users buying and using bitcoin being steady means that Bitcoin will roughly double in price every 4 years. New adoption simply means bitcoin appreciates much faster \n\n2) The market prices in these expectations beforehand and thus Bitcoin might appreciate even before the next halving. The larger Bull market usually is delayed 6-12 months after the halving as scarcity sets in \n\n3) The halving creates a bull market cycle because there is a feedback loop created as the price continues to appreciate encouraging more investment and more adoption as the price goes up which is why you see Bitcoin grow to 5-20x in value in bull markets and not just double in value \n\n4) Since this is the very early adoption phase in bitcoin at ~2% global adoption bitcoin is likely going to remain volatile for at least 7 more years and still has much more room for growth",

                    "response": "Everyone who runs a bitcoin node gets a vote. You could run a node if you wanted to. A node is just you running the bitcoin protocol on your computer and participating in verifying transactions. A miner is a node that also confirms new transactions onto the ledger via a hashing algorithm called SHA-256. The nodes verify that these new transactions are legit, and if all are in agreement, a new block is created. \n\nConsensus across the nodes would be needed to change the protocol and it\u2019s not in the nodes and miners\u2019 best interests to do so because expanding the supply would cause the price to plummet. It\u2019s in the best interest of the miners to maintain the integrity of the protocol and not do something that would drop the price or their income would drop too.\n\nThat\u2019s essentially why the bitcoin network is so secure. At this stage, with how much hashing power there is in the network, it is next to impossible to be able to control a majority of the nodes and change the protocol to your liking. And even if you did, everyone could see that and could just ignore your malicious ledger.\n\nThis is discussed in detail in The Bitcoin Standard, I highly recommend the audiobook.",

This would result in a sharp decrease in the value of Bitcoin. Since the miners hold and mine Bitcoin, they are disincentivized to take such action.\n\nAlso, such action would likely result in a hard fork. Meaning that miners who chose not to adopt such code, would continue to run with the original 21M limit. At this point, people can elect which network they want to participate in. The one that doesn't dilute their holdings or the one that does. It's clear that very few would choose the inflationary network.",

The most common, secure form of 2FA is TOTP (Time-based One Time Passwords), which is frequently linked with the Google Authenticator app, although the TOTP system is an open standard and many alternative apps exist for it.

                    "response": "Here it goes:\n\n* First you get a hard wallet. Preferably you want something that offers a duress PIN. I prefer Coldcards, which happen to be made in Canada. A duress PIN is for *plausible deniability*. If the duress PIN is provided for example, it will lead to a real wallet different than your actual wallet, which you made or may not choose to keep some BTC. This is for wrench attacks, dishonest border guards, or if a court compels you to open a device.\n* Next you MEMORIZE your seed. Why? Because, when you're in a high risk environment, you may have police show up to your bank with a warrant and gas tools. They may kick down your door. This means they may seize your hard wallet or metal stamped backups. Then how do you access your bitcoin? DO NOT STAMP OR WRITE DOWN YOUR SEED. They ever get that, it's over. The seed goes in your head, and on the hard wallet, or hard wallet's (plural), because you should clone these at least twice. Give one to a trusted third-party, keep one in the bank, and use the other one. If you lose them all, you still have the keys bonded to your person (brain) and are analog self-sovereign.\n* Next you run your own node. Why? Because, you can broadcast your own transactions with zero 3rd parties involved. And because you have access to the best conjoin/joinmarket options. Your node can be easily ran remotely even if you're not in the country with iOS/Android apps like ZeusLN, which is super user friendly and fun to use. Many put their nodes in countries they don't live in to begin with for various reasons ranging from taxes to privacy. You can use your hard wallet with your node.\n* Next, you don't buy BTC from CEXs (centralized exchanges)--ever. These are the only vectors governments can lever blockchain forensics effectively. You use established bitcoin DEXs (decentralized exchanges) like [Bisq.network](https://Bisq.network), or [Hodlhodl.com](https://Hodlhodl.com) whenever you want to buy or sell BTC.\n* Next (and this is optional) learn how to use powerful tools like BTCPayserver.\n* Lastly and most obviously, always use a VPN. That goes for your computer and phone\n\nAll this shit is a beginners guide, but should be enough for 99.9% of all privacy concerns. Blockchain forensics firms btw, grossly overstate their capabilities, and to PROVE ownership of a wallet, the US and Canada would need access to your physical device or Xpub/Zpub. These cases are very difficult an expensive to prosecute, which is why you see major hacks take years to build cases. Hell, just avoid CEX's and it's probably enough for 99.9% of privacy problems.

Without scarcity, cryptocurrency may as well be fiat. Good money is scarce. The biggest weakness of cryptocurrencies is that they can be created easily from nothing. All alts are like this. But Bitcoin is different. It has miraculously been born and has gained a huge lead in network effects. This can not be copied. Thus, it has gained scarcity. It is extremely decentralised, and has by far the greatest hashing power on the planet, and distribution of full nodes, which makes it not possible to tamper with the monetary policy. Bitcoin has scarcity due to network effect lead and \u201cun-tamper-ability\u201d.\n\nThe Lindy effect will only make it stronger as day after day it doesn\u2019t die. It can\u2019t be eradicated, just like a cancer that has spread too far.\n\nThe copies cannot compete with this. It needs the majority to not only leave Bitcoin, but mostly leave to the same choice. There are thousands of choices, so those few people that abandon Bitcoin will not all go to the same choice. In other words, defectors will disperse, not concentrate. The only way this could theoretically happen is if there is some fatal flaw with Bitcoin, AND it can\u2019t be fixed, AND an altcoin can, AND only one altcoin can.\n\nE.g. let\u2019s say Bitcoin\u2019s privacy weakness (really it\u2019s a trade off, not a weakness and any other coin with privacy just chooses a different trade off) is suddenly critical and everyone is exiting. Where will they go? Monero, Zcash, DASH, some to ETH and XRP (not private btw), Cardano\u2026. Can they all be money? Money printer go brrrr much?\n\nSo how else can an Altcoin take over? Remember that people will save in the best money. An Altcoin must become fundamentally better. In the open source world, how is that possible? It\u2019s like thinking it\u2019s possible for a better operating system to exist than the dominant open source one today (GNU Linux). The open source leader just gets better and better. All new ideas get absorbed.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine another currency finds a good use case. Let\u2019s say smart contracts. First that\u2019s like saying paper is money and valuable because contracts can be written on it. No, you need to make good money first, not find other uses for it. Aluminium has more uses than gold but it\u2019s less valuable because it is not money. It can\u2019t be money because it is not scarce. But even if smart contracts makes a cryptocurrency into good money, there are too many: ETH, Cardano, TRON, Iota, probably others.\n\nAs soon as any becomes valuable, it will invite competition and it will be copied. There is no scarcity. For goodness sake, ETH doesn\u2019t even work yet. Its Turing completeness is not even used. Bitcoin has smart contract capability and I understand nearly everything ETH is doing program-wise can be done with Bitcoin. Let\u2019s face it, it is competing with Bitcoin as a money and is far far behind and has no credibility. What will Vitalik Buterin do with the monetary policy next?\n\nETH is just another fiat with a central banker. That is not a true cryptocurrency. Remember why Bitcoin was born \u2013 we are fighting central banking and trying to separate money and state, not shoot ourselves in the foot by losing focus, trying to get rich by improving on the solution we already miraculously discovered. Bitcoin is that: a miracle \u2013 and we should embrace it.\n\nAlso, you mention ROI. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist so you can buy it and sell it for more fiat later. It is a REPLACEMENT for fiat. You buy and NEVER sell. You spend once it achieves its true value. You don\u2019t need an exit strategy. You just save in Bitcoin. With alts, you need to time your exit and sell to a greater fool, because alts are scams, holding forever will get you rekt. Just DCA Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s like picking up gold off the ground before anyone else realises it will become money. Don\u2019t pick up pebbles or seashells (alts), your pockets have limited space. Finally, the most important problem to solve is separating money and state. All other problems are tiny in comparison. We don\u2019t need to replace the legal system with smart contracts. We don\u2019t need a token for everything. We don\u2019t need to put bananas on a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is an invention that solves a humanitarian problem. Altcoins take a solution (blockchain) and try to find a problem. Remember that.",

                    "response": "!LNTIP 500\n\nKeep asking questions and learning!  \n\nBitcoin wallets can be sorted into two categories. Custodial wallets and non-custodial wallets. Custodial wallets are like unsecured bank accounts. Kind of like banks in the old west. When you put your money in a custodial wallet, the company that runs that wallet has your actual money, but you have access to it. If a \u201cbank robber\u201d (aka hacker) robs the old West Bank (custodian) you\u2019re out of luck.\n\nNow usually banks have better security than you normally do, so it might be ok, but there\u2019s nobody to complain to if the custodian gets hacked. Your money is gone. Most exchanges' wallet (coinbase, kraken, etc.) is this kind of wallet.\n\nA non-custodial wallet puts you in full control. You\u2019re responsible for security, and if you lose the wallet no biggie, as long as you have your secure \u201ckeys\u201d saved somewhere. Keys to a bitcoin wallet are represented by a series of random words that you can write down or memorize.\n\nAs long as you never digitize these words (no pics, no email, etc) just in your head or on paper, you cannot lose your money, and nobody can take it from you by hacking. There is a saying in bitcoin circles: \u201cNot your keys? Not your coin.\u201d\n\nFor small amounts of bitcoin, a custodial wallet is no problem. I keep a little bitcoin in a custodial wallet like cash app or coinbase because it\u2019s convenient. For larger amounts of bitcoin, I would highly recommend using a non-custodial wallet.\n\nHere\u2019s a good rule of thumb. Only keep an amount of bitcoin in a custodial wallet that you would feel comfortable with in your real wallet. So if you carry around $100 in your wallet, no biggie. If you lose your wallet, it\u2019s gonna suck, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. Now if you had $5k , you probably wouldn\u2019t carry that in your wallet.\n\nSo if you ever get to the point that the bitcoin you have is worth more than you would carry in your wallet, you should move it to a non-custodial wallet where you control the keys. https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html\n\nIf this is a \"medium\" amount of money like a month or two of salary, a non-custodial wallet on your phone is fine.\n\nIf it starts climbing into a 6-12 month salary or more, I'd recommend a hardware wallet. I really like the Trezor.\n\nOnce you get a non-custodial wallet, be sure to protect those seed words they give you for backup. That is your bitcoin, not the hardware device or your phone. If you have those seed words safely stored somewhere, you can recover from any hardware loss.\n\nIf you want to go really secure, stamp those words in metal. I like these cause they aren't expensive: https://crypto-keys.com/pages/jameson-lopp-test\n\nBe sure to never digitize those words. Don't take a pic, dont put them on a computer, etc.. Write them on paper (The trezor comes with cards for this) at a minimum, and put them somewhere secure. If you do use paper, make sure they are in waterproof and fireproof envelopes. If you do decide to go with a hardware wallet, buy it directly from the manufacturer. If its tamper evident seals are broken, don't use it.",

With BTC, nearly everybody in the world had the chance to jump in when people were throwing BTC around like it was nothing - and Bitcoin itself hasn't changed much at all from what it is today. If the world has suddenly changed its priorities to the point BTC is important is just the free market being the free market.\n\nEven today, with the observations you've made, note that BTC still hasn't sold out. Early investors are getting rewarded for taking the risk.\n\nAnd so you can either decide whether you feel it has upward potential that massive and to therefore invest... or wait for everyone else to feel that way and so BTC gets sold out.",

Then it's up to Visa to say whether or not I get your money. That's a pull system. \n\nWith Bitcoin, only you can push a payment. Only the person with the private keys can send Bitcoin to a proper Bitcoin address. That address can belong to you, someone else, a Bitcoin exchange, etc. Nobody can pull money from your Bitcoin stack. \n\nPlus Bitcoin is BTC as it's currency. The supply of BTC is algorithmically determined. We know the exact supply of BTC at all times. And we know almost exactly what it will be at all points into the future. \n\nEvery 10 minutes, a Bitcoin miner finds a block. They get a block reward plus the transaction fees from their block. The block reward is newly created BTC. Every 4 years the block reward is cut in half. This means every 4 years Bitcoin cuts its inflation rate in half, and that causes the price of Bitcoin to soar due to the supply shock.

This means that you must link your full node to your personal wallet . This is typically done with electrum personal server + electrum (or these 2 and a hw wallet is better) or using a full node like https://getumbrel.com/ is another example \n\nEven if 100% of the hashrate colludes against you they cannot force rule changes or remove rules you enforce as you are ultimately in control of the bitcoin and consensus rules. The more secure you are , the more secure the network is against those that try and coerce changes to the network that lack consensus.\n\nSimply setting up a full node with 0 control of your own personal BTC has little to any benefit outside of the slight benefit if you run an archival full node and have your ports open you can help bootstrap other new full nodes\n\nRunning software that fully validates all the rules like - https://btcinformation.org/en/wallets/desktop/windows/bitcoincore/\n\nArchival full nodes contain the full blockchain and allow new nodes to bootstrap from them . Current blockchain size is ~400GB for an archival node\n\nPruned nodes can get down to around 5GB , and have all the same security and privacy benefits of archival nodes but need to initially download the whole blockchain for full validation before deleting it (It actually prunes as it validates)\n\nYou are only truly p2p if you are running a full node . running light clients depend upon you trusting a middleman and typically only validate block headers. Light clients are exposed to many more threats full nodes are not. There are also privacy concerns with light clients that full nodes are secure against. The whitepaper only suggests SPV \"light\" nodes in the context of fraud alerts(proofs) existing but thus far none exist and therefore you shouldn't trust large amounts of btc with a light client.\n\nThe most secure , \"active\" wallet would be a hardware wallet integrated with a full node . One way to do this easily is to run your own electrum server https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JMP4NZCC5g  and than integrate electrum wallet with your HW wallet and connect to your electrum server. \n\nThere are close to 53k  full nodes on the bitcoin network .(Some sites show much lower numbers because they exclude most non listening full nodes. )\n\nHere is the stats \u2013 \n\nhttp://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/software.html\n\nhttp://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/services.html\n\nHere are all the rules that full nodes validate that light clients almost completely skip-\n\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_rules",

It sounds like that might make sense for you. \n\nA hardware wallet is a way to get some extra resiliency. With something like Exodus, if my computer crashes, my wallet (and money) are only recoverable with the 12-word seed. Hardware wallets protect against that, at the expense of being a little more hassle to use. \n\nI have not had any experience with a hardware wallet, but from what I've seen they typically expose some sort of lightweight browser interface you can access via a browser extension.

Make sure you use a reputable site to generate your paper wallet. \n\nAll a paper wallet is is your address and private key written on a pretty piece of paper. To access and spend coins as long as you have your private key and address you own those coins.  You can choose to encrypt the private key as well, so that you could keep copies of your paper wallet more places and you wouldn't have to be (as) worried about losing your coins as you would be if the private key were in plain-text. \n\nIf you choose to encrypt it, I would make sure to paste the encrypted key into the 'wallet details' of the site (linked) and make sure that you know how to get your unencrypted private key back. \n\nThe two things that are critical to know about paper wallet is that you can't let people see it that you don't trust to spend the money, and you need to keep the address so that you know your private key and address. Keep it safe, remember where all copies are and keep it secret.\n\nWhen you decide you want to spend your coins, you can get a wallet like electrum or your choice and choose to import or 'sweep' your address into your new wallet, and spend from there. \n\nI'm a big fan of paper wallets. Hope this helps if you decide to go this route. Again, paper wallets are probably best for hodlers. \n",

Giving your seed phrase and password to *anyone* risks anything from their metal stamped seed words being compromised by your lawyer and your crypto stolen, to your family using social engineering or a bounty to steal your password from your lawyer, to them just deciding to team up with your lawyer to take your crypto.    \n\nDo you know what your lawyer's IT security protocols are? Is your lawyer resistant to data breaches? Who has access to your lawyer's offices?   \n\nIf you're going to use the metal plates method, go to a bank with lock boxes in an actual vault (not just locked drawers in a room), and leave the seedphrase there. The passphrase is now less critical. You have to assume that both your family and your lawyer have poor security habits, as most people don't know anything about security.\n\n\n*edit: tagging /u/MountainousFog for visibility*",

Well, the taxes part is, technically, but only if you sell the bitcoin for cash or cash equivalent. \n\nAnyone can setup a \"node.\" A node is a part of the network that assists with transactions, & is a core part of the infrastructure. You end up downloading all or a recent part of the blockchain, & your node helps verify transactions. Note: this is NOT the same thing as mining. \n\nThis node then becomes your wallet, as well. \n\nThen, you can acquire crypto a few different ways without purchasing via Paypal and such. It could be as simple as giving cash to a friend who is willing to buy via a centralized exchange. It could be as involved as setting up your own mining rig. Either way, you can get coin that is anonymous. \n\nHowever, anonymity & privacy aren't necessarily the point. They CAN be, and there a projects dedicated to that. But, the point at a larger scale, is a more democratic monetary system. In the case of most cryptocurrency right now, that resulted in non-private blockchains. But there's no philosophical reason that has to be the case, it was just the simplest secure way for the first iterations. \n\nFinally, it's important to understand WHY cryptocurrency is more democratic. Open source code is at the core of it. Anyone can look at the code, & draw conclusions from it. That doesn't mean everyone has to or should, but they can. But this means the currency is FAIR. There's no central bank printing money for someone else while you & I are left in the lurch. With crypto, you, the big guys, & I, all play by the same rules. \n\nTaxes? Death & taxes & all that. They only tax when you sell. So buy, hodl, spend. No selling.",

It is also one of the most renewable industries already, and will be a useful component in subsidising green energy generation technologies. It is not a major contributor of global warming emissions, it's not even close.\n\n...And then what critics will do 9 times out of 10 when this is pointed out, is pivot instead to '*Well, it's still a \\*waste\\* of energy*\" - essentially showing their actual colours they they think bitcoin shouldn't exist and needs to justify itself to them. \n\nThankfully, nobody has unilateral authority to assign what consitutes a 'waste' of energy. A mechanism to move any amount of value across any geopolitical boundary almost instantly with no counterparty risk or authority oversight on the most most secure network with the hardest asset on earth is evidently useful in the eyes of the global free market.",

Privacy serves utility to more than just criminals. It\u2019s a critical piece of ensuring Bitcoin retains its censorship resistant properties. Also, it\u2019s more traceable than you might think. Technologies like CoinJoin transactions, HD wallets, and Lightning Network are making it more difficult to trace - but that\u2019s a good thing to the world and a bad thing for authoritarians. If you\u2019re concerned about traceability, just look up some of the recent major investigations. You\u2019ll quickly see that the transparency of the blockchain actually aids regulators and investigators in this regard in many ways, much better than what fiat transactions offer.\n\n3. Check out these Twitter resources. Bitcoins energy use is also a highly complex topic. But to start, if you can\u2019t see the value of a trustless, global, interdiction resistant, privacy preserving, deflationary monetary system then you will likely see any energy use as a waste. Almost all improvements to civilization have required energy (look at washing machines, cars). Bitcoin is no different. It\u2019s up to the people to determine if that energy use is worthwhile. https://mobile.twitter.com/mtcbtc/status/1346813481257984001\n\nEdit - I\u2019d also encourage you to research the Lightning Network. It addresses some of your concerns. Also the energy use per transaction statistic is highly misleading. Many transactions can be bundled into one, there are second layer solutions like lightning network that only do final settlement of many transactions on the base layer blockchain, etc. Looking at energy use on a per transaction basis just isn\u2019t a representative metric of what is driving the energy consumption",

To imply they would starve themselves to death is unrealistic, and to imply they will make themselves homeless by waiting for the bottom of a \"bottomless housing bear market\" is also unrealistic.\n\nSo as long as there is market demand for something, there is always profit in businesses creating goods and services.

Many countries that have had some sort of ban in the past with Bitcoin have reversed this ban because they can't stop Bitcoin usage and it makes them seem inept. \n\nFor the USA a ban is unlikely for these reasons \n\n1) The Trendon Shavers case gave legal precedent that Bitcoin is not an illegal security according to the Howey test\n\n2) The IRS has already formalized how it treats Bitcoin (as an asset)\n\n3) Many wealthy and highly connected individuals have personally invested in Bitcoin and they wont be too happy if their peers in politics make Bitcoin illegal\n\n4) Traditional Fintech in the USA like ICE/BAKKT(owner of NYSE) , Fidelity, TD ameritrade, CME, and more are already directly involved in Bitcoin mining, investing and trading.\n\n5) Exchanges like coinbase, square, gemini , and more already are very large companies heavily involved in Bitcoin\n\n6) Many local states have both case law and legislation on Bitcoin making it more difficult to make illegal\n\n7) There is plenty of existing case law in US courts that have shown encryption and code to fall under the 1st amendment protections\n\n8)\tMaking it illegal would not stop bitcoin but just reflect they are a totalitarian government and an inept one at that because stopping Bitcoin is far more difficult than winning the war on drugs\n>\u201cI think we were past that point [of banning Bitcoin in the US] very early on because you\u2019d have to shut down the internet,\u201d Peirce said. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you could ban it. You could certainly make the effort. It would be very hard to stop people from doing it [trading Bitcoin],\u201d she said. \"So I think it would be a foolish thing for the government to try to do that.\" -- Hester Peirce, one of the commissioner of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)",

Bitcoin is too widespread and too difficult to control for governments to successfully ban it. In addition, most people who use Bitcoin do so for legitimate reasons, so there is not much reason for governments to try to ban it. There is a chance that Bitcoin could be regulated in the future, but this is unlikely to have a major impact on its popularity or usefulness.",

Bitcoin can handle millions of transactions per second , that are private , a fraction of a penny and get instant confirmations. Just use a lightning wallet \n\n> what I can see the power consumption from PoW is a real issue. \n\nThis notion comes  from a flawed understanding of economics. Fiat currency and PoS coins cost at least the same amount of resources to  create , regulate and secure as Bitcoin.\n\nThere is an inescapable reality for any asset or currency that as it increases in value the production costs and costs to secure increase as well . This is demonstrated in the economic axiom: MC=MR\n\n\u201cRent\u201d always forces production costs (MC) to always equal sale prices (MR)\n\nPoS currencies and fiat are simply more abstract and complex forms or Proof of Work that use more human involvement (which uses tremendous amounts of resources and has a tremendous environmental impact) as a PoW coin like Bitcoin. Humans instead of ASICs are shouldering more of the work to create, regulate , and secure each of those currencies; This is \"work\" whether it involves burning electricity directly or food and electricity that humans consume  to perform their work. This is an inescapable economic reality. The more valuable something is the more it will cost to secure it because the more effort will be made to steal and or control it. This applies to any currency or asset.\n\nThis is also better understood with the dollar auction dilemma. In a hypothetical auction where a bidding war is fighting over the right to mint a 1 dollar bill how much do you think people will be willing to spend for this power ?\n\n---------------\n\nBitcoin is the only Cryptocurrency proven itself to be secure and decentralized\n\n99% of altcoins/ICOs are scams and its difficult to evaluate them unless you know the history of these projects and are a programmer yourself so can evaluate their claims\n\nAltcoins will come and go as we have always seen but bitcoin having a first mover advantage means that it is has the most network effect and best chance of surviving longterm \n\nOne of the primary reasons Bitcoin was created was to have a sound monetary policy and digital scarcity , and being a multicoiner undermines all of this\n\nUsing wallets and software that supports multiple coins is confusing  and can lead to mistakes where you can lose money and makes the software far more insecure with a wider attack surface and potential for bugs and exploits \n\nWhen looking at the long term graphs , most altcoins pump and dump and lose value relative to Bitcoin. \n\nGetting involved with altcoins forces you to spend a ton of extra time learning complex and obscure projects \n\nScammers prefer to target people that use altcoins as we saw with the ICO craze because Bitcoiners tend to have more experience and be more skeptical to evaluate their claims\n\nBeing involved in altcoins usually means you don't have long term time preferences and simply want to speculate short term which many people will consider a character flaw because you are more of a gambler \n\nBitcoin has an uphill battle as is so any distractions weakens the possibility of it becoming a global p2p currency (Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency that can achieve this with its network effect and roadmap)\n\n------------------\n\nWhy Proof of work is important -\n\n1) They do not legally fit the Howey test as a security. This is not merely an opinion but tested case law in the USA. \n\n2) A similar amount of effort in securing the coin must be invested to be rewarded the coin creating long term incentives in the project and making it very costly to attack it. Miners who have sunk infrastructure costs on mining a particular algo, especially with ASICs\n\n3)  Fair Coin Distribution.  No scammy ICO , premine or instamine is created and miners are forced to sell most of their coins to cover the expense (mainly ASICs + electricity) which allows a fair distribution and competition in the minting process.\n\n4) Since mining BTC is so competitive, profit margins are typically thin and thus new entrants that either use a better tool to mine (ASIC) or find cheaper sources of power(typically green due to the economics) can quickly gain market share making lasting monopolies difficult. Even if a main ASIC manufacturer appears to have a large market share we can see this quickly change due to a single malinvestment or a mistake when developing the newest ASIC. Power is a resource that comes from many sources and allows many locations around the world to remain competitive for unique reasons. \n\n5) Objective Security- Proof of work gives us an objective and measurable degree of security where risk assessments can be made with greater precision that isn't afforded with more subjective forms of security.\n\n5)\tThere is no company that controls a pure PoW coin in many cases thus the project will win or fail on its own merit and doesn't have a long burn rate created by speculators",

Most altcoins are scams , fads, or pump and dumps and **the only reason this internal currency exists is to fundraise or make the creators/early investors wealthy.** These projects are usually extremely centralized and act more like unregulated companies creating an illegal security to raise capital.\n\nThis is why being 100% proof of work is so important as it removes the concerns attracting attention from regulators because you no longer satisfy the Howey test as being considered a security and you insure a fair coin distribution where anyone can mine and miners are forced to distribute most of their coins to cover costs.\n\nNow let\u2019s discuss perverse incentives these types of ICOs create- \n\n1) With traditional fundraising(VC + Angel) savvy and accredited investors can properly investigate and vet a companies plan, product, and creators unlike the type of investors that these ICOs attract that just prefer to speculate and don't really care many times if it is a scam or not. This creates pumps and dumps and temporary distortions of price. \n\n2) With traditional fundraising the investors typically get a **legal** stake in the company so have aligned interests in the company succeeding longterm, unlike with ICOs where many of the investors are interested in short term profits and are happy to jump from one project to the next. These tokens they are selling give no legal ownership to the underlying company that is promoting this security like shares in a company do. \n\n3) Giving most of the money upfront with little sales , an unfinished product and a yet to be established client base creates perverse incentives to \n\n>a) Incentivize the creators and lead devs to build up this project just enough so it looks they  tried, dump it and start another ICO for more free money. We have seen this time and time again with devs like Daniel Larimer. \n\n>b) Incentivize the business to spend too much and not receive crucial feedback from sales they depend on because they have so much funding upfront. There is a reason traditional investing typically has a strict contract between thee investor and the business , with staged payouts , and multiple rounds of funding , where conditions are set and the investors sometimes even get a vote on the board. There is a reason VC investment typically waits to invest until their is some proven sales or client acquisition before investing. All of this is not the case with ICOs of this nature.\n\n4) The free floating speculative nature of their investment creates a perverse incentive to focus on marketing and promoting rather than security , utility, and product development. This is not the case with stable investments like we see where VC slowly invests fiat or is allowed to control in a contract how the fiat is spent. \n\n5) The fact that many of these ICOs keep a majority of their tokens allows them to easily manipulate the price due to most of the utility being frozen and in their control. This makes their \"blockchain\" very centralized and controlled. \n\n6) Getting a large amount of funding upfront allows the company to offer various bribes to affiliates, exchanges, oracles, and coin leaderboard lists to promote and sell their coin. Unlike with a project that starts humble and has to be vetted by everyone based upon merit alone because they don't have this funding to bribe others with. \n\n7) The fact that this ICO fits the Howey tests it opens up this company for lawsuits as we see actively occurring right now and future regulation and fines putting investors at risk",

Additionally, fiat currencies like the dollar, euro and yuan have deep entrenched network effects that are difficult to overcome . This is the same reason that Bitcoin is most likely going to be the candidate of being the worlds p2p decentralized money (monetary policy, security, liquidity and network effect being far superior to altcoins ). \n\nThe most we will likely see IMHO in our lifetimes is many countries hedging their reserve assets in Bitcoin + GOLD or Bitcoin + world reserve fiat like USD (example = El Salvador) or possibly getting rid of gold altogether as a reserve asset due to asteroid mining and just using Bitcoin. Additionally, I can foresee many countries becoming dual currency countries (like already exists throughout the world) where they accept their local fiat and Bitcoin for day to day txs. \n\n>how do you determine its value.\n\nThe same way this is done today. All Currency, commodities, and Assets derive their value subjectively from humans. \n\nhttps://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value\n\nThis is usually done with trading pairs. \n\nBitcoin/fiat or Bitcoin/gold or Bitcoin/altcoins \n\nAs you can see, trading pairs exist between commodities and money as well so you do not need fiat or altcoins to exist to determine value. \n\n>today's world 1 bitcoin's value is determined how much it is traded and expressed in US Dollars\n\nThis is incorrect. Bitcoin has many trading pairs outside of USD . USD could completely disappear and Bitcoin can still determine its purchasing price in the free market. \n\n>Why crypto currency are an investment majorly as of now and nothing else?\n\nI spend and replace my bitcoin almost everyday as p2p money and many others do as well. To answer your question about why most of it is speculative :\n\nBitcoin is going through the normal stages of becoming a currency.\n\nCollectible>Asset/commodity>volatile currency>Stable unit of account currency\n\nRight now Bitcoin is between stage 2 and 3. \n\nBitcoin is superior to fiat and gold in many ways already but a great problem for adoption as a currency is volatility . We hope volatility will drop in time with higher liquidity and UX keeps improving every year. \n\n>learn more about Web3 and Blockchain technology.\n\nMost of this is a scam buzzword for marketing so be careful and watch this :\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un1CegKO1xo\n\n>What are some good resources\n\nI would suggest learning the basics first \n\nhttps://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html\n\nhttps://www.lopp.net/lightning-information.html\n\nhttps://10hoursofbitcoin.com/\n\nhttp://bitcoinrabbithole.org/\n\nhttps://bitcoin-resources.com\n\nhttps://www.bitcoin101.club\n\nhttps://21lessons.com\n\n>I have these genuine doubts \n\nIt is 100% right to be skeptical , this ecosystem is filled with lies and scams.

As Bitcoins market cap grows and monetary inflation drops it appears that we will likely see very low deflation (occasionally people losing some coins) which is perfectly fine because the market will factor those expectations into consideration for loans and debt.\n________________________________________\nI personally prefer slight deflation for these reasons :\n\n1)\tEncourages people to invest in things they really need instead of unnecessary fluff and short term desires which is good for society and the environment\n\n2)\tencourages more savings instead of debt slavery which removes choice, confidence and power away from individuals\n\n\n3)\tkeeps fiat currency in check where too much inflation will cause more capital flight to Bitcoin and prevents corrupt governments from abusing the backdoor tax of inflation\n\n4) Reduces the negative cantillon effect of fiat by removing some of the control over currency from a small group of people that is in part due to fiat being inflationary\nhttps://fee.org/articles/the-cantillon-effect-because-of-inflation-we-re-financing-the-financiers/",

A node is just you running the bitcoin protocol on your computer and participating in verifying transactions. A miner is a node that also confirms new transactions onto the ledger via a hashing algorithm called SHA-256. The nodes verify that these new transactions are legit, and if all are in agreement, a new block is created. \n\nConsensus across the nodes would be needed to change the protocol and it\u2019s not in the nodes and miners\u2019 best interests to do so because expanding the supply would cause the price to plummet. It\u2019s in the best interest of the miners to maintain the integrity of the protocol and not do something that would drop the price or their income would drop too.\n\nThat\u2019s essentially why the bitcoin network is so secure. At this stage, with how much hashing power there is in the network, it is next to impossible to be able to control a majority of the nodes and change the protocol to your liking. And even if you did, everyone could see that and could just ignore your malicious ledger.\n\nThis is discussed in detail in The Bitcoin Standard, I highly recommend the audiobook.",

This would result in a sharp decrease in the value of Bitcoin.

Meaning that miners who chose not to adopt such code, would continue to run with the original 21M limit. At this point, people can elect which network they want to participate in.

What matters is the fact that there is a limit, there is scarcity that is open , predictable , and agreed upon beforehand and not manipulated by corrupt Central planners like fiat or some altcoins (even popular ones) do.\n\nSince Bitcoin is extremely divisible (13 decimal places in a payment channel) the total amount doesn't matter because even if Bitcoin is worth 100 million a coin you can still have enough divisibility to buy a cup of coffee. \n\n**There is plenty of parts to go around** \n\nDivisibility is not the same thing as increased inflation either as 1 usd = 4 quarters = 10 dimes = 100 pennies with purchasing power and inflation only occurs when another dollar is printed to drive down the spending power of each dollar.\n\nAround 2-4 million BTC have been permanently lost or burnt this but most of these bitcoin were lost in the first 2 years when it didn't have any or much value. These days its rare to lose Bitcoin because its so valuable\n\nWhen any of the above happens it does not harm Bitcoin network at all, and simply acts as a charitable donation to all Bitcoin users making Bitcoin more scarce",

A realistic short term (20-50 years) outlook for Bitcoin is some countries have it as legal tender, some countries just legally allow it and try to regulate the onramps and offramps , some countries create banking bans but dont outright make it illegal and some countries make it illegal. \n\nTo answer your question , in the extremely unlikely event that 100% of countries make bitcoin illegal , Bitcoin will thrive on the black market , which it has plenty of growth to gain market share in because its mostly dominated with fiat in. Any country eliminating cash and switching to CBDC are simply forcing people to use Bitcoin instead as well",

At that moment, the market cap of Bitcoin is $21 million - however, not everyone wants to sell their bitcoin for $1. Let's say someone puts in another order to buy a bitcoin at $1 - but no one wants to sell for that price. The next best price is $1.50 - and finally the person who wants to buy moves their offer to $1.50 and the trade goes through - the market cap is now $31.5 million.\n\nSo the market cap is really their guess at the total value of all Bitcoin based on the last few trades at a certain price.\n\nIt doesn't mean all Bitcoin is worth that - as demand to buy more increases, the sellers could ask for more money and the price would rise.

What you would suggest is coinjoin in a wallet joinmarket instead. \n\nAlthough for most people this is not needed.\n\n> It does not take a forensic accountant to realize that Wallet B is associated with Wallet A.\n\nThis cannot occur if you send the complete balance from wallet A to a new address in wallet B . Additionally, outsiders cannot link individual UTXOs within either wallet or know how many wallets do or do not exist in my example. \n\nKeep in mind that those UTXOs will not be mixed in wallet B because the example I give is just for people concerned about long term privacy. When they are ready to spend those Bitcoin in wallet B they can just use coin control and load up each UTXO in its own lightning channel or any other private layer 2 solution. \n\n>Sending it from A to B every single time and calling that consumption is one of the easiest ways to get traced.\n\nTo an outsider there will be no link between UTXOs. To the exchange they will merely assume that the withdrawal address belongs to you in wallet A , and they won't know who controls wallet B or how many wallets exist that represent wallet B, and they wont know how many wallets you have for all the addresses in wallet A either.\n\n-----------------\n\nEdit - If you are curious to know how a person can make a mistake than the answer is the following:\n\nThey want to sell some of their Bitcoin for fiat from wallet B. So they lazily use a regular wallet without coin control and send the entire balance onchain back to the same exchange they bought the Bitcoin from combining all their UTXOs. The mistake here is 3 fold which ruins your privacy in different ways-\n\n1) Using the same exchange you bought the bitcoin from allowing them to use chain analysis to complete the loop \n\n2) Not using coin control to keep the UTXOs separate\n\n3) Using a regulated CEX to sell your btc for fiat instead of privately spending your bitcoin or privately selling your bitcoin(atm, dex, p2p)\n\nAll three aspects ruin your privacy in different manners",

This allowed Bitcoin to grow in a natural and decentralized manner with proof of work and no premine. \n\nSome points of interest in what makes Bitcoin truly decentralized:\n\n1) No premine or instamine of coins. \n\n2) The whitepaper was published on October 31, 2008 and the first software was released on November 16, 2008 and Satoshi contacted many people that might be interested for months before mining the genesis block on January 3, 2009. \n\n3) Since there was over 3 days between the genesis block being mined and block 1 and difficulty was 1 it would be safer to assume satoshi waited for other miners to start mining before joining in . Satoshi included the message \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\u201d in the genesis block to timestamp the launch and prove no premining was done. Other miners like Hal Finney started mining as soon as Jan 10th, 2009 from his twitter post.\n\n4) The Genesis block that Satoshi mined is unspendable thus not giving an award to the creator \n\n5) Bitcoins market price was 0 till October 5, 2009 , thus miners sacrificed energy and resources for no reward initially just to support the network \n\n6) In the first 4 years many faucets existed to widely distribute Bitcoin to anyone that wanted to participate \n\n7) Bitcoin has the longest history in existence and the largest network effect of diverse users and developers of different backgrounds \n\n8) Bitcoin has already proven to be truly decentralized with a hostile takeover from a majority of miners, payment processors, and exchanges that tried to impose a hard fork (segwit2x being the last failed attempt that tried to increase the block limit to a max of ~7.4 MB ) in 2017 that didn't have sufficient consensus \n\n9) No company created and launched Bitcoin unlike many altcoins . \n\n10) Bitcoin is 100% open source with a diverse group of hundreds of developers contributing from many different backgrounds and many independent implementations of Bitcoin full nodes (core, knots,btcd,bcoin,libbitcoin, ....) More than any other altcoin and all with different means of coming to consensus. \n\n11) Satoshi walked away from Bitcoin early on making sure there is no cult leader people would follow\n\n12) Proof of work is the most important innovation in Bitcoin and the real reason why blocks , in a blockchain, exist. PoW is critical to maintaining decentralization as PoS is not only less secure but will always trend towards centralization because those with the most capital will have the most stake to collect the most fees in a vicious feedback loop where they grow in controlling the network. Bitcoin uses meritocracy of PoW insures bitcoin remains decentralized with a resource everyone has access to (electricity)\n\nSince mining BTC is so competitive, profit margins are typically thin and thus new entrants that either use a better tool to mine (ASIC) or find cheaper sources of power(typically green due to the economics) can quickly gain market share making lasting monopolies difficult. Even if a main ASIC manufacturer appears to have a large market share we can see this quickly change due to a single malinvestment or a mistake when developing the newest ASIC. Power is a resource that comes from many sources and allows many locations around the world to remain competitive for unique reasons.\n\n\n13) Bitcoin has the most hashrate security\n\n14) Bitcoin is the most stable non pegged cryptocurrency with the most liquidity\n\n15) Bitcoin has the most development and best roadmap",

The owner of the Bitcoin is registered as a number, not your name. The code you have is how you can create a wallet and tell the wallet which Bitcoin is yours. The code includes not only which Bitcoin is yours but also a secret code that allows you to control (sell or transfer) the Bitcoin. Nobody else in the world can sell or transfer your coin because they don't have that secret code.\n\nOnce you create the wallet you won't have to manually enter long complicated codes anymore. The wallet is just software to give you a nice interface on all the long codes used in Bitcoin.\n\n\\*IMPORTANT\\* If anyone else gets their hands on that secret code then they too can sell or transfer your Bitcoin - probably to themselves. Because you posted your question you will no doubt have already received many private messages from \"helpful\" people wanting you to tell them your secret code. If you do give out your secret code you can kiss your Bitcoin goodbye. There would be no way to ever get it back.\n\nYour secret code is either a long string of random looking letters and numbers known as a \"Private Key\" or it is a list of 12 or 24 words known as a \"Recovery Seed\". They are roughly equivalent.\n\nTo create a wallet, install some trusted wallet software. My favorite is \"Electrum\". There are many others. Read and ask around to make sure it is a trusted wallet, not a scammer's tool to steal your Bitcoin. Entering your secret code on your computer to set up your wallet is a risk. If you have a virus keystroke logger it could be watching for Bitcoin seeds.\n\nThis should give you a general understanding of what you have and what to do next. You should read up on how to safely create your wallet a bit before doing it. Read up on some options such as creating a wallet on a computer that is not on the Internet; on buying a hardware wallet like a \"Ledger\"; On booting your computer into a temporary Linux OS to set up a wallet. I don't know your level of technical expertise so I'll leave that for your reading.",

Depending how fast or slow your PC is, it could take up to 45 minutes to catch up, for each 24 hours off-line. If you're on-line for 6 hours every day, you never have to wait more than 30 minutes to catch up with the 18 hours off-line. How long on-line and off-line is your free choice. But you won't be able to use your node's wallet while it is catching up. This could be inconvenient if you have an urgent transaction to send. Or it may not matter if you're good at planning ahead  \n\nIf your node is always on-line, it is always up to date",

Being above or below the 20 week moving average has been used to define bull and bear phases of traditional markets for a long time.\n\nThe 50, 100, 200 time period moving averages have been seen as longer term averages that can support price action. There are other technical indicators that are functions of moving averages, e.g., the MACD is the 12-period exponential moving averaging minus the 26-period exponential moving average. And there are lots of other indicators, e.g., MVRV Z-Score (Market Cap - Realized Cap) / (Standard Deviation (Market cap)) alongside the moving averages that traders consider in determining good prices to buy and sell. In turn, these all can persuade market participation by traders and investors.\n\nBen's risk metric is another really good one, and he is great at long term analysis with following crypto for the past ten years. Another YouTuber I follow, Eric Crown Krypto, is (has also worked as) a trader. He's especially good with shorter term movements and uses a ton of moving averages and other indicators to talk about what can be expected.",

I use Bitdefender and never had any issues with it. Also, agree with others on here, I actually read every character when copy and pasting a crypto address, to make sure it wasn't corrupted.\n\nIt would be interesting to see what address the malware changed to, and you can check that out in the blockchain. Not going to help you get your money back, but you could search that address in google and maybe find others with a similar issue, which coudl help pinpoint what malware got into your pc..",
