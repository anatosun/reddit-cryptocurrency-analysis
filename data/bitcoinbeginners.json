To an outsider looking at a blockchain they cannot identify that the addresses all belong to the same wallet unless the user combines those UTXOs together. If someone sends them some dust to an old address now they have at least 2 UTXOs associated with that address. They can spend the UTXOs separately , but if they don't use coin control than its possible the wallet selects the dust from address A , with another UTXO from address B and than the attacker knows that Address A and address B are in the same wallet.",

You create this \"paper\" or metal wallet with a hardware wallet. \n\n>A question I'm still unsure about: Such hardware wallets are independent of the Internet, aren't they?\n\nMost hardware wallets are used connected to the internet so should be considered as \"warm wallets\". They isolate the private key creation , storage , and tx signing so they are better than just using a software wallet alone however \n\n> Ledger.com eventually goes bankrupt and their app/website is offline? \n\nI would avoid that hardware wallet but most hardware wallets use standard BIP39 backups so can be used with other hardware or software wallets . It doesn't matter if the company disappears\n\n>?You still can\u2019t get to the Bitcoin because the hardware wallet only works with the Ledger.com website?\n\nThats not how hardware wallets work , you aren't forced to use trezor suite or ledger live . You can use hardware wallets with many independent software wallets \n\n> Do you still invest in other cryptocurrencies on a long-term basis?\n\n99% of altcoins are scams (not all are) but this is offtopic here\n\n>The problem is always the long-term and life expectancy\n\nThan just stick with bitcoin , because most altcoins will disappear or lose 99.9% of their value and are just pump and dumps",

(Every node has an almost identical mempool)\n\n- Miners select transactions from the mempool to create a new block.\n\n- To communicate with a node, you need a Bitcoin wallet.\n\nThe wallet is connected to a node and can check how many bitcoins you have and which address.\n\nIf you make a transaction:\n\n- Your wallet sends a msg to the node; I wish to send 1 BTC to Jack.\n\n- The node will check this transaction. Do you have this 1 BTC, and is the destination a correct address.\n\n- If the check is passed, the node will place this transaction in the mempool.\n\n- The node will inform every other node and wallet that you created a transaction, 1 BTC to Jack. (= 0 confirmation)\n\n- The miners will select transactions from the mempool to create a new block.\n\n- if your transaction is in a new block, you have 1 confirmation.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n- Your wallet has to inform a node when you create a new transaction. So you have to come online to connect to a node. (You can use every possible technology to connect to a node, but the most used is the internet)\n\n- To receive bitcoin, you don't have to be online. But your wallet doesn't know about the transaction. The next time when your wallet comes online, the wallet will check the blockchain and notice that you received coins on address X.",

But the way frame the question shows you don't want to hear that answer.  If the value hadn't spiked then I don't think there'd be much of a question. If the value had fallen then I'd replace the value of it when borrowed.\n\nWhy does the lender get the best of both worlds?  Because you owe them.  Why should they lose out?  You should be able to make them whole again at least.  Otherwise lending to you is not going to be an attractive endeavour in future.  Now, in an ideal world this would have been discussed but often it isn't.\n\nSo I guess you return the original value plus I'd throw in some extra.  You'd have to figure out what the extra is depending on your means.\n\nAnother thing to consider is what they'd have done with the BTC had they not lent it to you?  I mean lets say you have the means to return the value of BTC in full, does that mean current value, value at the peak (how likely would they have sold the peak) or did they have a value in mind where they'd have sold?\n\nI guess you have to be practical given the out of the ordinary spike in value.  So what is right and what you do might not match.  \n\nThe lesson here is to discuss in advance and perhaps denominate the debt in the fiat value of the time.",

With that said for crypto it's generally not worth it.\n\nBecause of the nature of crypto (owning your keys = you have sole control of the coins), and how prevalent fraud is, exchanges can't risk getting chargebacks for credit card transactions. In theory someone could buy crypto, transfer it out and initiate a chargeback thus screwing the exchange over. This is almost always why credit card purchases have extra fees and most credit cards block crypto purchases.\n\nMost responsible people use credit cards for the benefits and features such as rewards, purchase protection, etc. It's not always about spending what you don't have.",

This represents a high demand, low supply situation.  This causes prices to rise.\n\nOn the flip side, when there are more sellers than buyers then you have a low demand, high supply situation.

When you're using a spread you're just buying at that amount at the time, you'll see for example that you'll have like 15 seconds or so to hit \"OK\", after that the price changes and you have another 15 seconds to hit the \"OK\" button again. It's using a spread so if BTC is priced at $40,000, using a spread you might see that it's more like $40200 when you bought it.\n\nCoinbase basic sucks as far as fees go, you'll not see me defend that, it's something like a $3 fee plus if you buy $100 plus the spread.\n\nCoinbase Pro you can set limit buy/sells that buys your order once the price hits that mark, then all you pay is the maker/taker fee, which is pennies compared to the $3 fee + spread. If BTC is currently at $43k but you want to buy at $39k, then you can set a limit buy and it'll fill it once it hits that mark. Pretty nice really.\n\nIs Coinbase Pro the best? Eh. FTX won't allow you buy less than BTC 0.0001, so you always end up w/ some change you have to convert, so it's kinda annoying, but it has better maker/taker fees (you can get a permanent discount on fees if you sign up through the Coin Bureau's page as well).\n\nAnywhere that you can buy BTC easily works for me. FTX & Coinbase Pro allows you link a bank account w/out going through Plaid, so win IMO.\n\nRobinhood has a lot of hate, they also have  a lot of lawsuits, so there's that..",

Also, the depreciating dollar is constantly pulling the rug out from anyone who is economically marginalized and trying to get an economic foothold so they can better their life. An appreciating currency rewards saving, and takes the power of economic social control away from the central banks who print money and give it to their friends for free at the expense of the masses. And eventually, whether in retirement or otherwise, people will sell whatever assets they have (unless they take loans against it) which will move the asset back into circulation (if we consider an appreciating currency an asset).  Thinking about an appreciating unit of currency vs. a depreciating unit of currency does require a fundamental shift in the way you conceptualize money, and how that money shapes thought and society.",

As Bitcoins market cap grows and monetary inflation drops it appears that we will likely see very low deflation (occasionally people losing some coins) which is perfectly fine because the market will factor those expectations into consideration for loans and debt.\n________________________________________\nI personally prefer slight deflation for these reasons :\n\n1)\tEncourages people to invest in things they really need instead of unnecessary fluff and short term desires which is good for society and the environment\n\n2)\tencourages more savings instead of debt slavery which removes choice, confidence and power away from individuals\n\n\n3)\tkeeps fiat currency in check where too much inflation will cause more capital flight to Bitcoin and prevents corrupt governments from abusing the backdoor tax of inflation\n\n4) Reduces the negative cantillon effect of fiat by removing some of the control over currency from a small group of people that is in part due to fiat being inflationary\nhttps://fee.org/articles/the-cantillon-effect-because-of-inflation-we-re-financing-the-financiers/",

What you are referring to is some of the larger companies that want it cash settled for accounting and tax purposes that use bitcoin as a \"payment rail\" instead. \n\nUsing bitcoin as a payment rail still is very important step in adoption for the following reasons \n\n1) Even if bitcoin is only held for a second per txs we are talking about some of the largest companies in the world with trillions of dollars in tx volume so this does tie up some bitcoin creating scarcity due to the sheer volume in txs \n\n2) bitcoin is foremost p2p money , thus we want to make it more easy for spenders to use their bitcoin \n\n3) Spending the bitcoin instead of selling for fiat allows many benefits from not announcing a taxable event to reducing fees by removing the exchange fee \n\n4) Many stores pass the savings onto the consumer with discounts with bitcoin . Even if you don't use bitcoin any stores that accept it will benefit you indirectly because their overhead from merchant processing fees and chargebacks will be less so everyone benefits \n\n5) More stores accepting bitcoin helps bitcoins brand awareness \n\n6) Some of these large merchants in the future might start keeping the bitcoin or at minimum hedging their balance sheet with some bitcoin in the future and this is just the first step \nhttps://bitcointreasuries.net/",

                                    "response": "> I know it would be a guess but where do you see the price of bitcoin in 10 years?\n\nBitcoin is in the very early days of adoption with 2% adoption globally so can grow much larger in the future\n\nNone of us knows the perfect time to invest or can predict the price . The intelligentsia of the market is the combined knowledge of all humans and algorithms which is more than knowledge than anyone can have. Also bitcoin is so scarce that a single wealthy investor can significantly move the market in secret and unannounced.\nRather than trying to time the market , let time work for you.\n\n**Time in the market will tend to beat timing the market**\n\n\nI don't care much about the price , but consider the following 2 aspects in growing my savings of BTC-\n\n1) Is Bitcoin still following its key principles and working? \n\n2) Is it before 2029 (7 years from now), thereafter I might consider taking profits off previous investments \n\nPersonally even if BTC is 1 million dollars a coin I will still be accumulating because the following -\n\nI believe Bitcoin is going to be over 1 million USD per BTC in value in the future. When this will occur , I have no idea.  Around 2-4 million BTC have been permanently lost or burnt. This means that you have around 15 million to 17 million BTC will be fought over in the next few years , but many Bitcoin users are long term hodlers so at least half of those BTC are trapped in their savings. Thus you have a situation where 7-8 million BTC could potentially be purchased with ~2755 Billionaires in the world and at least ~56 million millionaires. If even a small percentage of these wealthy investors wanted to hedge 1-5% of their portfolio in Bitcoin they couldn't without dramatically increasing the value of Bitcoin. These days it is actually dangerous not to have at least 5% exposure to Bitcoin because it is an uncorrelated asset class and one needs a balanced portfolio. This is how scarce Bitcoin is. \n \nRead this for more details - \n \nhttps://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1\n \n \nI have no plans on taking any profits(I am just going to spend and replace while keep increasing my BTC savings every year) for at least 7 years due to this. -\n \nWhy?\n \nThere is a generational change occurring with not only investing but preference in banking and currency usage. \n \nmillennial's and Generation Z grew up in the digital world and have little interest in investing in gold or silver and don't trust banks. People investing in gold and silver(or gold mining companies) I meet are typically in their late 40s or older. What is interesting about this shift is the key aspect of gold that these older gold bugs appreciate about their investment , being tangible and physical commodity that can be used and held physically , is the same thing that these 2 last generations reject and see as a burden or something that takes up space or inconvenient to store or secure.\n \nGeneration Y or Millennial's (born ~1982 to 2002) are now 37 to 17 and will begin to replace generation X as the new group with the greatest investing and spending capital (ages 45-54). This means in as little as 8 years you are going to start to see the transition of millennial into peak spending/investing ages and start to push out gen X who is more ambivalent/mixed to digital era. Baby boomers will be well into retirement and not be investing/spending and more living off their IRAs and pensions and their lack of familiarity and confidence of cryptocurrency will have little consequence. Thus in 8 years you will have gen Y enter their peak spending and investing and gen Z fill the next greatest category of spenders/investors(early career).\n \nThe other key takeaway is that these age groups also shift from not only spending more but investing more which is critical. Let\u2019s look at the breakdown averages in the USA-\n \n1) Less than 25 Years Old \u2013 $31,102 in spending (94.6%% of total income)\n \n2) Between 25-34 Years \u2013 $48,928 in spending (**70.8%** of total income)\n \n3) Between 45-54 Years \u2013 $64,781 in spending (**64.6%** of total income)\n \n4) Over 75 Years Old \u2013 $40,211 in spending (95.6% of total income)\n\nThese numbers represent spending and investing habits of different age demographics in the USA from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nhttps://www.visualcapitalist.com/how-americans-make-and-spend-their-money-by-age-group/\n\n\n \nNotice from 25 to 54 these individuals have the most money not only to spend but also to invest. Baby boomers retiring are spending almost all their income surviving (healthcare) and/or vacationing and no longer investing as much. Once gen Y and gen Z dominate these 2 age brackets than a heavy bias towards Bitcoin will occur.\n \nAnother issue is people and countries will start to transition away from gold in the future as a hedge \n \nIn 2026 Psyche will start reporting back to NASA the expected reality that there will a sudden hyper-inflationary spike in the volume of gold being mined in the near future\nhttps://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/psyche/\nSince psyche 16 asteroid represents an example of an asteroid that is a core of an early planet thus metallic and estimated to contain around $700 quintillion dollars of precious metals (gold, platinum, etc..) or 93 billion dollars of precious metals per person.\nWhile mining will not start immediately, the markets will start pricing in the expectation of mining and nation states will start to slowly sell their gold reserves if they are wise enough flooding the market with cheap gold.\nNation states will need an alternative asset to hedge against.\n\nFor the data showing you the shift in the last 2 generations perspectives read these - \n\nhttps://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/san2018-23.pdf\n\nhttps://perma.cc/6C7B-J5DD\n\nhttps://simplemoneylyfe.com/cryptocurrency-statistics/",

Since most of this Bitcoin needs to be sold to cover miner costs you have 900 x 41k usd = ~36,900,000 usd worth of Bitcoin that needs to be purchased daily in order to keep the price of  Bitcoin stable . \n\nIn approximately 751 days - https://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/ the amount of Bitcoin per block will be cut in half to 450 new Bitcoin a day or only ~18,450,000 usd of bitcoin needs to support miners at todays current price. \n\nThis means :\n\n1) Bitcoin technically doesn't **necessarily** need new adoption to continue to grow in value . Current users buying and using bitcoin being steady means that Bitcoin will roughly double in price every 4 years. New adoption simply means bitcoin appreciates much faster \n\n2) The market prices in these expectations beforehand and thus Bitcoin might appreciate even before the next halving. The larger Bull market usually is delayed 6-12 months after the halving as scarcity sets in \n\n3) The halving creates a bull market cycle because there is a feedback loop created as the price continues to appreciate encouraging more investment and more adoption as the price goes up which is why you see Bitcoin grow to 5-20x in value in bull markets and not just double in value \n\n4) Since this is the very early adoption phase in bitcoin at ~2% global adoption bitcoin is likely going to remain volatile for at least 7 more years and still has much more room for growth",

The monthly maintenance cost to operate this equipment at around $0.10 / kWh is slightly under $235 per month. This will generate around 0.0047 BTC per day after pool fees.\n\n10x Antminer S19j Pro has an upfront cost of $87,000 with a few mining providers (us being one) offering discounts and financing options with monthly payments. At the current Bitcoin mining difficulty, it will take around 213 days for these 10 ASICs to produce a whole Bitcoin. Total electricity and maintenance costs to produce a whole Bitcoin will be around $16,500 for that duration with this particular equipment setup.When taking into consideration the initial investment for equipment and the energy required to produce a Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin should not be lower than the costs it take to produce a Bitcoin given its fixed supply. However, if it does drop lower, then Bitcoin could be considered undervalued like it was during the bear market of 2018.\n\nAfter the next Bitcoin halving, it will be exponentially harder to mine Bitcoin, which makes producing Bitcoin more costly. If technology does not evolve at a rapid rate to accommodate this change, then it will also take longer to produce a whole Bitcoin. When the cost and time to produce a Bitcoin increases, then the price of Bitcoin should also increase. The halving is the catalyst.",

After learning about it, I realised it\u2019s not the main reason. Bitcoin was designed first and foremost to solve a trust problem:\n\nTrust that the people who are supposed to guard our money (bankers) don\u2019t make greedy/ stupid investment decisions with 97% of our money, leaving only 3% \u201cfractional reserve\u201d in the bank and go bankrupt when their bad decisions materialise.\n\nTrust that a handful of really powerful people with the \u201cprint more fiat at no cost\u201d button don\u2019t abuse that power to enrich themselves and their peers.\n\nSimple, but almost impossible, proven by our thousand years history of spectacular nation state collapses due to rampant breaches of that trust. To be honest, if I were one of those people, I wouldn\u2019t be able to resist the temptation for long either. Printing excessively is equivalent to robbing everybody all at once through high inflation.\n\nNowadays, Bitcoin is solving payment problems beautifully with lightning.

                    "response": "\"Nothing has intrinsic value.\"\n\nFalse. At least when viewed as a financial instrument and not as a philosophy... There are numerous ways that intrinsic value is calculated and the reason this is given so much attention in traditional finance is because without knowing a company's value, you have no idea if the asset is currently over/under valued. As an investor or trader, this can be an important factor when stock picking.\n\nI think the fear from traditional market participants comes from the fact that BTCs value is derived from its use cases (much in the same way some fiat is valued) and market sentiment. For anyone outside the forex realm this can be terrifying. Stocks/companies have capital to lean on which sets a psychological floor above zero in the minds of these investors. Traders seem to be more accepting of these risks likely due to the strategies they use which require volatility in an asset. As with most fiat, value is derived from trust in their use cases. I personally appreciate the purity of price driven by market sentiment and use cases alone as a trader. \n\nSo I think BTCs intrinsic value today is in its use as a decentralized P2P payment system and speculative asset. As a speculative asset, BTCs value is derived through the transference of risk from one party to another over time with the potential to take an economic rent for your trouble. By definition, as a speculative asset the future is uncertain though which may cause problems as CBDCs move into the market and attack its primary use case as a payment system. If the majority doesn't really need decentralized financial instruments like BTC we may well see its intrinsic value drop. That said, the reason most of you are here is to make money and very few things in life have huge returns without similar risks. It's not for everyone...",

If an attacker finds out the number you've registered with an exchange or custodial wallet, they can attempt a SIM-swap attack and get the number moved to a SIM they control and from that point onward receive all SMS messages sent to it.\n\nIdeally, your coins should not be in a custodial wallet at all, but should be managed with a hardware wallet or a properly secured software wallet on a device you own.\n\nBut if that's not an option (for example if you're trading), then you should use proper two-factor-authentication. The most common, secure form of 2FA is TOTP (Time-based One Time Passwords), which is frequently linked with the Google Authenticator app, although the TOTP system is an open standard and many alternative apps exist for it. TOTP apps don't need an internet connection once installed (although they do need a clock that's somewhat accurate), so you can just use an old smartphone or tablet for this purpose.",

There are free, anonymous e-mail services that you could use ([protonmail.com](https://protonmail.com)) if you don't trust your e-mail provider. You can access some of those over Tor to hide your IP from them too. That's mostly anonymous. But you can't be sure the company you bought from doesn't give a list of their transactions to the government. The feds can then trace the transactions on the block chain. I'd guess your KYC-exchange almost certainly provides the IRS with your identity and withdraw address (assuming you withdraw to a non-custodial wallet). If there aren't any or are very few transactions between exchange->you and ???->vendor, the government can take an educated guess that you == ???. (Moral: just pay the capital gains tax, it's not worth the risk.)\n\nYou can donate to charity -- they just need your money, not your info.\n\nSo, the answer depends very much on what exactly you'd like to buy and from whom you're trying to say anonymous.\n\nis mostly theoretical and the First Amendment is a historical relic.",

The fee structure has changes to 0.6% taker / 0.4% maker for both coinbase pro and coinbase advanced trader (found within coinbase.com) . \n\ncoinbase advanced trader major UX improvement is the ability of a slider to select amount and to do incremental 1,5,10% limit orders so you don't have to manually do this with a calculator \n\nThe trick to get the lower 0.4% is to set a limit order, click advanced , and select \"post only\" under execution to make it a \"maker\" order \n\nthus these days coinbase advanced trader  is slightly better to use than coinbase pro IMHO",

A duress PIN is for *plausible deniability*. If the duress PIN is provided for example, it will lead to a real wallet different than your actual wallet, which you made or may not choose to keep some BTC. This is for wrench attacks, dishonest border guards, or if a court compels you to open a device.\n* Next you MEMORIZE your seed. Why? Because, when you're in a high risk environment, you may have police show up to your bank with a warrant and gas tools. They may kick down your door. This means they may seize your hard wallet or metal stamped backups. Then how do you access your bitcoin? DO NOT STAMP OR WRITE DOWN YOUR SEED. They ever get that, it's over. The seed goes in your head, and on the hard wallet, or hard wallet's (plural), because you should clone these at least twice. Give one to a trusted third-party, keep one in the bank, and use the other one. If you lose them all, you still have the keys bonded to your person (brain) and are analog self-sovereign.\n* Next you run your own node. Why? Because, you can broadcast your own transactions with zero 3rd parties involved. And because you have access to the best conjoin/joinmarket options. Your node can be easily ran remotely even if you're not in the country with iOS/Android apps like ZeusLN, which is super user friendly and fun to use. Many put their nodes in countries they don't live in to begin with for various reasons ranging from taxes to privacy. You can use your hard wallet with your node.\n* Next, you don't buy BTC from CEXs (centralized exchanges)--ever. These are the only vectors governments can lever blockchain forensics effectively. You use established bitcoin DEXs (decentralized exchanges) like [Bisq.network](https://Bisq.network), or [Hodlhodl.com](https://Hodlhodl.com) whenever you want to buy or sell BTC.\n* Next (and this is optional) learn how to use powerful tools like BTCPayserver.\n* Lastly and most obviously, always use a VPN. That goes for your computer and phone\n\nAll this shit is a beginners guide, but should be enough for 99.9% of all privacy concerns. Blockchain forensics firms btw, grossly overstate their capabilities, and to PROVE ownership of a wallet, the US and Canada would need access to your physical device or Xpub/Zpub. These cases are very difficult an expensive to prosecute, which is why you see major hacks take years to build cases. Hell, just avoid CEX's and it's probably enough for 99.9% of privacy problems.

Trezor wallets are safe and user friendly, but you still need to be careful and use them properly.  If you make a mistake, you can still lose your coins.  It's easy not to make a mistake as long as you always take your time though, never rush a transaction.  Double and then triple check everything before clicking send.\n\nAlso, if you're going to get into crypto please spend 20-30 mins researching what kind of scams are used to steal btc from people.  Unfortunately scammers are everywhere, but the good thing is they aren't too smart, so if you learn their scams and are careful they are VERY easy to spot.  Take the time to learn first before putting money in.\n\nScammers will browse the crypto subs and look for beginners like yourself.  They send a DM and will try all sorts of things to get your money.  Never trust a DM regarding crypto.  They will do things like \"help\" you learn how to buy, but they steal it. Or they promise to \"help\" you invest, but again will steal it.  This can all easily be avoided by spending the time to learn before you put money in.",

But the order only applies to regulated exchanges. Bitcoin is a cash instrument. Exchanges are not part of Bitcoin. They are a parasitic attachment, earning fees for the convenience of instant transactions\n\n> How did the government manage to do it?\n\nThe people organizing Bitcoin donations for the convoy were lazy and ignorant. Bitcoin has a well-known rule, no address reuse, no exceptions  \nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse  \n\nThe donation requests publicly announced a small number of Bitcoin addresses, and received hundreds or thousands of separate donations to those addresses. This makes it easy for authority to nominate those addresses in blocking orders  \n\nA Bitcoin wallet has thousands, or millions of addresses. If you're receiving Bitcoin, as donations or shopping payments or wages, only use an address once, and only display the address to the person who is offering to pay\n\n> Coinbase\n\nNot real Bitcoin, nothing more than an account with a balance, like PayPal. Bitcoin is not a balance in an account. Bitcoin is cash in your pocket\n\n> avoid asset forfeiture by creditors and government. How do I go about doing this?\n\nYou can not.

This works by bundling your transition data + your private key and hashing the whole thing with one of those special algorithms again. This is the critical part that ideally is happening on an airgapped device because it's the only time your private key is exposed. The magic is that to verify this transaction is authentic, I only need to know the transaction details + your **public** key. Because your public key is mathematically correlated to your private key it can prove unequivocally that it originated from your private key. Meanwhile you never had to expose your private key to the Internet.\n\nYour image analogy doesn't really apply, it's best not to think of it as the BTC being \"in\" your wallet. The wallet doesn't contain anything, it's just your way of interacting with the network. I prefer to think of it as certain bitcoin (UTXOs) get your address assigned as their owner. When you send someone BTC it doesn't leave your wallet and enters theirs; your name (address) gets taken off of it and it gets assigned a new owner (recipient address). Your address leaves, not the bitcoin.",

This is an unsigned transaction. The private key is used to sign that transaction. Signed transactions are what are recorded in the blockchain, and are the ultimate proof of what a private key is worth.\n\nThink of a public key as a signature, and a private key as the hand of the person who has that signature. Then add in that in the bitcoin system, forgery of another person's signature is effectively impossible. We are essentially sending value to other people's signatures, and the only way that value will leave the recipients hands is if they, and only they, sign off on sending it out again.\n\nThe biggest difference between this analogy and the reality is that it's entirely possible to send value to a signature that no one actually has or may ever have, and that if you aren't careful with your private key \"hand\", someone can cut it off and write your signatures with it. But that's the gist of it. If you can keep a private key private, then the value attributed to that key by the blockchain will never, under any condition, leave it until you spend it intentionally.

The address you give out for people to send to is a public key and then the bitcoin can only be spent from that address when a transaction is signed with the private key. A cold storage device stores the private key required to sign a transaction and spend any bitcoin associated with the private key. To keep the key offline a transaction is first built in a \"watching wallet\" that only has the public key. The partially signed bitcoin transaction (PSBT) is then transfered to the cold wallet and fully signed with the private key. Once signed the transaction is transferred back to an internet connected device to be broadcast. This process prevents the private key from ever being exposed to an internet connected device and the secure chip used in the cold wallet prevents the private key from being extracted when the PSBT is transfered to be signed.\n\nEdit: Also it's not quite similar to the Facebook example that you gave because the private key can be generated offline on the cold storage device. This means the private key is never communicated over the internet or stored on some sever. Anyone who wants to access the private key must be in possession of the physical device.",

I think they charge a minimum flat fee of 0.0005 BTC, which is over $20 right now and is WAY too high.\n\nTransaction fees are generally not constant, but depend on things like the number of inputs into a transaction (how many UTXOs, or \"chunks\", of bitcoin that you are spending from), and on the current demand for the block space (how many other entities are trying to do a transaction at that moment in time). It doesn't directly depend on the amount of bitcoin you are sending. You can see recommended fees at [mempool.space](https://mempool.space).",

In real life this won\u2019t matter much, you just hand the coins over, but in the bitcoin world they matter because each \u201ccoin\u201d (an UTXO) is information and it takes up block space, so the transaction fee for handing someone 100 x 10 cents coins (that\u2019s 100 UTXOs)  on the blockchain will be a lot more expensive than handing just one $10 note (just 1 UTXO). That\u2019s how your bitcoin transaction fees is calculated. \n\nExchanges like Binance just obscure the whole thing with a fixed charge and they just bear some of the ups and downs to make it simple to users",

I thought about to buy gold instead, \n\nI used to be into PMs , but years ago sold all of my gold and silver when I started to wake up and learn the truth.\n\nGold is more difficult to secure, takes up more space, my stocks have been a much higher ROI, historically gold is a horrible Store of value dropping in purchasing power for many years and far longer than Bitcoin bear markets, almost no one accepts gold or silver, it is difficult to spend because not as potable or divisible. In a SHTF scenario people won't be using gold to barter either. The whole \"intrinsic value\" marketing slogan is a myth.",

During period of high deflation(appreciation) tx velocity tends to increase and merchant processors actually see an increase in spending for goods and services and charitable giving in Bitcoin.\n\nThis is believed to be caused by the feeling of newfound wealth(because they are wealthier) eventually overrides their desire to \"hoard\" (when did savings become a negative thing?) their Bitcoin.\n\nOf course more data needs to confirm this and as we enter another bull cycle(rapid deflation) it looks like we will get another round of data to confirm this.\n\nBitcoin is already testing some economic theories and proving them somewhat inaccurate but the data gathering is far from over and we all have a lot to learn .\nI personally suspect that what matters for a viable currency besides these other properties discussed here\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/gnzeeo/will_bitcoin_ever_be_adopted_by_the_general_public/frcry8f/\n\nIs stability and thus either low and predictable inflation or low and predictable deflation (1-4%) can both be suitable. As Bitcoins market cap grows and monetary inflation drops it appears that we will likely see very low deflation (occasionally people losing some coins) which is perfectly fine because the market will factor those expectations into consideration for loans and debt.\n________________________________________\nI personally prefer slight deflation for these reasons :\n\n1)\tEncourages people to invest in things they really need instead of unnecessary fluff and short term desires which is good for society and the environment\n\n2)\tencourages more savings instead of debt slavery which removes choice, confidence and power away from individuals\n\n\n3)\tkeeps fiat currency in check where too much inflation will cause more capital flight to Bitcoin and prevents corrupt governments from abusing the backdoor tax of inflation\n\n4) Reduces the negative cantillon effect of fiat by removing some of the control over currency from a small group of people that is in part due to fiat being inflationary\nhttps://fee.org/articles/the-cantillon-effect-because-of-inflation-we-re-financing-the-financiers/",

Maybe some of those addresses started off with $100 but it was back in 2010.\n\nAlso, the whole practice of \"don't re-use addresses\" wasn't very popular in the past because it would mean multiple backups and complicated setups. Today, it takes just a single backup thanks to new ideas being developed over time. I wouldn't be surprised if there were people using old technology, especially the richer ones who are too busy living it up to care about changing their setups.\n\n\n> how do I know what my wallet address or balance is?\n\nYOU know your balance because your wallet tells you. If you are using a hardware wallet, then it may even be able to provide an XPUB file to you which will let you set up a mobile wallet that can see your addresses but can't spend from them (watch-only wallet). BlueWallet with a ColdCard is a good setup for example.\n\nThe addresses you own are practically random, there is no observable pattern that others can use to see your addresses. However, they are technically not random, with a single key, a program will be able to get a list of all of your addresses, and if that key is the private key or your seed words, then that program can also spend it.\n\n> If I use electrum how can I find out my wallets address?\n\nThe best way is to get an XPUB file or a \"watch-only export file\" or whatever your hardware wallet or software wallet might call it. Depending on what your wallet is, the instructions on how to get this may be different or the feature may not even exist.\n\nWith the XPUB, you can load that into Electrum and it will show you all of your addresses and your balance. \n\nIf you can't get an XPUB, then your best bet is to give it your private keys or mnemonic seed words. Unless you are a digital security expert, don't bother. Chances are you might get lucky and not lose all of your bitcoin, but there is a less than 0% chance that you get unlucky and make some security mistake and a few days later you find all your bitcoin was stolen.",

The balance of an individual address can be seen by anyone, because that can just be derived from blockchain data. But there is no general way to determine if 2 different addresses belong to the same user.\n\nNote that this later statement only applies in general. There are situations where someone can, with a high degree of certainty, conclude that multiple addresses belong to the same person. If you make a basic transaction using funds from multiple addresses (*n* inputs, 1 or 2 outputs), then an observer may conclude that these source addresses belong to the same user.",

                    "response": "Ok noob. I'm going to save your life here. \n\nJust buy BTC. \n\nhttps://armantheparman.com/why-bitcoin-only/\n\nI want to start by stressing that it all comes down to scarcity. Without scarcity, cryptocurrency may as well be fiat. Good money is scarce. The biggest weakness of cryptocurrencies is that they can be created easily from nothing. All alts are like this. But Bitcoin is different. It has miraculously been born and has gained a huge lead in network effects. This can not be copied. Thus, it has gained scarcity. It is extremely decentralised, and has by far the greatest hashing power on the planet, and distribution of full nodes, which makes it not possible to tamper with the monetary policy. Bitcoin has scarcity due to network effect lead and \u201cun-tamper-ability\u201d.\n\nThe Lindy effect will only make it stronger as day after day it doesn\u2019t die. It can\u2019t be eradicated, just like a cancer that has spread too far.\n\nThe copies cannot compete with this. It needs the majority to not only leave Bitcoin, but mostly leave to the same choice. There are thousands of choices, so those few people that abandon Bitcoin will not all go to the same choice. In other words, defectors will disperse, not concentrate. The only way this could theoretically happen is if there is some fatal flaw with Bitcoin, AND it can\u2019t be fixed, AND an altcoin can, AND only one altcoin can.\n\nE.g. let\u2019s say Bitcoin\u2019s privacy weakness (really it\u2019s a trade off, not a weakness and any other coin with privacy just chooses a different trade off) is suddenly critical and everyone is exiting. Where will they go? Monero, Zcash, DASH, some to ETH and XRP (not private btw), Cardano\u2026. Can they all be money? Money printer go brrrr much?\n\nSo how else can an Altcoin take over? Remember that people will save in the best money. An Altcoin must become fundamentally better. In the open source world, how is that possible? It\u2019s like thinking it\u2019s possible for a better operating system to exist than the dominant open source one today (GNU Linux). The open source leader just gets better and better. All new ideas get absorbed.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine another currency finds a good use case. Let\u2019s say smart contracts. First that\u2019s like saying paper is money and valuable because contracts can be written on it. No, you need to make good money first, not find other uses for it. Aluminium has more uses than gold but it\u2019s less valuable because it is not money. It can\u2019t be money because it is not scarce. But even if smart contracts makes a cryptocurrency into good money, there are too many: ETH, Cardano, TRON, Iota, probably others.\n\nAs soon as any becomes valuable, it will invite competition and it will be copied. There is no scarcity. For goodness sake, ETH doesn\u2019t even work yet. Its Turing completeness is not even used. Bitcoin has smart contract capability and I understand nearly everything ETH is doing program-wise can be done with Bitcoin. Let\u2019s face it, it is competing with Bitcoin as a money and is far far behind and has no credibility. What will Vitalik Buterin do with the monetary policy next?\n\nETH is just another fiat with a central banker. That is not a true cryptocurrency. Remember why Bitcoin was born \u2013 we are fighting central banking and trying to separate money and state, not shoot ourselves in the foot by losing focus, trying to get rich by improving on the solution we already miraculously discovered. Bitcoin is that: a miracle \u2013 and we should embrace it.\n\nAlso, you mention ROI. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist so you can buy it and sell it for more fiat later. It is a REPLACEMENT for fiat. You buy and NEVER sell. You spend once it achieves its true value. You don\u2019t need an exit strategy. You just save in Bitcoin. With alts, you need to time your exit and sell to a greater fool, because alts are scams, holding forever will get you rekt. Just DCA Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s like picking up gold off the ground before anyone else realises it will become money. Don\u2019t pick up pebbles or seashells (alts), your pockets have limited space. Finally, the most important problem to solve is separating money and state. All other problems are tiny in comparison. We don\u2019t need to replace the legal system with smart contracts. We don\u2019t need a token for everything. We don\u2019t need to put bananas on a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is an invention that solves a humanitarian problem. Altcoins take a solution (blockchain) and try to find a problem. Remember that.",

Bitcoin is a volatile currency and until bitcoin becomes less volatile than fiat currency (may happen in time) than stores and paychecks will naturally be denominated in fiat terms as a unit of account , and than accept btc in a small 1-10 min window price conversion. \n\n>If not then it\u2019s just another form of the US dollar. \n\nJust because a store does their accounting in US dollars does not mean that bitcoin is another form of the US dollar. This would be akin to someone paying a company in euros and you calling euros as another form of the dollar just because the store decides to do their accounting in dollars which is nonsensical. If stores did their accounting in Bitcoin would you call fiat just some other form of bitcoin?\n\nSome stores will simply use bitcoin as a payment rail and autodump for fiat, other stores will convert a % to fiat to pay suppliers/employees but keep some in bitcoin , and other stores will accept btc directly and never convert to fiat.",

Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. \n\nBitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. \n\n\nThere are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties\n\nYou are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft \n\nYou are exposed to exit theft \n\nYou are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit\n\nYou place Bitcoin as a whole under more systemic risk by tempting exchanges to use fractional reserve banking and giving them too much influence\n\nYou potentially reduce the probability that your investment will appreciate in value because no exchanges are doing provable audits and they might be fractional. The more Bitcoin you personally control the more likely it will appreciate in value.\n\n**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet, custodian , or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**",

Custodial wallets are like unsecured bank accounts. Kind of like banks in the old west. When you put your money in a custodial wallet, the company that runs that wallet has your actual money, but you have access to it. If a \u201cbank robber\u201d (aka hacker) robs the old West Bank (custodian) you\u2019re out of luck.\n\nNow usually banks have better security than you normally do, so it might be ok, but there\u2019s nobody to complain to if the custodian gets hacked. Your money is gone. Most exchanges' wallet (coinbase, kraken, etc.) is this kind of wallet.\n\nA non-custodial wallet puts you in full control. You\u2019re responsible for security, and if you lose the wallet no biggie, as long as you have your secure \u201ckeys\u201d saved somewhere. Keys to a bitcoin wallet are represented by a series of random words that you can write down or memorize.\n\nAs long as you never digitize these words (no pics, no email, etc) just in your head or on paper, you cannot lose your money, and nobody can take it from you by hacking. There is a saying in bitcoin circles: \u201cNot your keys? Not your coin.\u201d\n\nFor small amounts of bitcoin, a custodial wallet is no problem. I keep a little bitcoin in a custodial wallet like cash app or coinbase because it\u2019s convenient. For larger amounts of bitcoin, I would highly recommend using a non-custodial wallet.\n\nHere\u2019s a good rule of thumb. Only keep an amount of bitcoin in a custodial wallet that you would feel comfortable with in your real wallet. So if you carry around $100 in your wallet, no biggie. If you lose your wallet, it\u2019s gonna suck, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. Now if you had $5k , you probably wouldn\u2019t carry that in your wallet.\n\nSo if you ever get to the point that the bitcoin you have is worth more than you would carry in your wallet, you should move it to a non-custodial wallet where you control the keys. https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html\n\nIf this is a \"medium\" amount of money like a month or two of salary, a non-custodial wallet on your phone is fine.\n\nIf it starts climbing into a 6-12 month salary or more, I'd recommend a hardware wallet. I really like the Trezor.\n\nOnce you get a non-custodial wallet, be sure to protect those seed words they give you for backup. That is your bitcoin, not the hardware device or your phone. If you have those seed words safely stored somewhere, you can recover from any hardware loss.\n\nIf you want to go really secure, stamp those words in metal. I like these cause they aren't expensive: https://crypto-keys.com/pages/jameson-lopp-test\n\nBe sure to never digitize those words. Don't take a pic, dont put them on a computer, etc.. Write them on paper (The trezor comes with cards for this) at a minimum, and put them somewhere secure. If you do use paper, make sure they are in waterproof and fireproof envelopes. If you do decide to go with a hardware wallet, buy it directly from the manufacturer. If its tamper evident seals are broken, don't use it.",

The best place to hold your bitcoin is in a self custody wallet preferably using cold storage. The truth is that you do not know if you really have any bitcoin until to get it into self custody. Anything you have on Coinbase is just a promise of bitcoin. You can start by downloading a software wallet to get familiar with self custody. I would recomend Electrum (electrum.org).",

Anybody can write an article and have it published at forbes.com  \n\nIn the beginning of Bitcoin, nodes and miners were two different functions on the same computers. In the second year, the roles split. But the myth that \"miners verify\" was established, and is repeated by ignorant people all the time  \n\nIf a miner does not verify his block's transactions, his invalid block will be rejected by the nodes he sends the block to. Nodes receive invalid blocks from somewhere many times per day  \n\nBitcoin is a multi-step process. New transactions are propagated around the node network. Miners collect transactions into blocks and participate in a guessing competition. One miner wins the race to add one block to the nodes' blockchains. The miner sends the block to his neighbor nodes. The nodes apply Bitcoin's consensus rules to the block and to the transactions in the block. If there are no errors, each node appends the new block to its blockchain and propagates the block to their neighbor nodes  \n\nNodes do not trust miners. Every block and all its transactions are checked by every node, independently. Nodes do not trust nodes. Each node only trusts itself to apply the consensus rules and accept or reject the block  \n\nBitcoin is a multi-step process. The transactions are only valid after being checked in the final step of the process - by every node in the node network\n\n> adding blocks that have been verified by non-mining nodes\n\nThat's the wrong way around. The unconfirmed transactions are assembled into blocks by miners. One miner wins the race. His block is then checked by the nodes, after mining",

They're mostly the same  \n\nPolicy rules are applied by nodes when they receive unconfirmed transactions. They block non-standard transactions, which are permitted in consensus. They also block some replacement transactions, and allow replace-by-fee. Policy rules block low-fee transactions. Consensus does not care about fee amounts  \n\nPolicy rules only consider each unconfirmed transaction, on its own and in the context of other unconfirmed transactions in the node's mempool  \n\nConsensus rules also consider the context of transactions within a block, where two or more transactions can have a parent-child relationship. The block is rejected if parent-child pairs are in the wrong order  \n\nUnder \"Independent Verification of Transactions\" in Mastering Bitcoin, the list of rules are policy rules. Further down, \"Validating a New Block\" has a list of rules for the block and the coinbase transaction, and a back reference to the policy rules, \"All transactions within the block are valid using the transaction checklist discussed in Independent Verification of Transactions\"  \n\nThere are policy rules which are not consensus - non-standard transactions, minimum fee, minimum output amount (dust rule), RBF. There are consensus rule which are not policy rules - the order of parent-child pairs within a block",

Blue Wallet is a highly recommend wallet for both Android & iOS. It will also create a seed when first setting up. You can use your HW wallet to backup your mobile wallet, but unless Ledger has changed, you'll probably have to alter the derivation path. However, Blue Wallet can be used as a watch-only wallet for your your Nano.\n\nTo execute transfers from one address to another, you can manually enter the receiving address, or more conveniently, scan a QR code that the wallet generates. Cashing out to fiat would require you to move coins from your wallet back to an exchange, selling and most likely incurring taxable gains, and then transfer to your bank account.",

I could be wrong though.\n\nThe simplest answer is to get a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger. Each of these support bitcoin and ethereum already.\n\nIf you want to make your own cold storage wallet for bitcoin I recommend creating a live USB containing Tails OS. This already has electrum bitcoin wallet included. At the login screen you can go to options and disable internet, then login. You create and use the wallet in this offline environment. You can copy the wallet's master public key to an online device with electrum to track your balance and create transactions to be signed offline. Usually this is done by scanning QR codes between the two devices.\n\nEdit: by default the Tails live USB deletes your session at shutdown. You can either create an encrypted space (tool included in Tails, do this on first boot, then restart unlocking it) or you can let it be deleted and restore from seed on a future use.",

Paper-based institutions remain the backbone of our society: money, seals, written signatures, bills, certificates and the use of double-entry bookkeeping.\n\nComputing power and breakthroughs in cryptography, along with the discovery and use of some new and interesting algorithms, have allowed the creation of distributed ledgers.\n\nIn its simplest form, a distributed ledger is a database held and updated independently by each participant (or node) in a large network. The distribution is unique: records are not communicated to various nodes by a central authority, but are instead independently constructed and held by every node. That is, every single node on the network processes every transaction, coming to its own conclusions and then voting on those conclusions to make certain the majority agree with the conclusions.\n\nOnce there is this consensus, the distributed ledger has been updated, and all nodes maintain their own identical copy of the ledger. This architecture allows for a new dexterity as a system of record that goes beyond being a simple database.\n\nDistributed Ledgers are a dynamic form of media and have properties and capabilities that go far beyond static paper-based ledgers. For more on this, please read our guide \"What Can a Blockchain Do?\" For now, the short version is they enable us to formalize and secure new kinds of relationships in the digital world.\n\nThe gist of these new kinds of relationships is that the cost of trust (heretofore provided by notaries, lawyers, banks, regulatory compliance officers, governments, etc\u2026) is avoided by the architecture and qualities of distributed ledgers.",

For example, memory-hard algorithms benefit from optimizing memory performance of your miner. GPUs already care a lot about memory performance, so it's unlikely an ASIC solution will do better. The GPU wastes some general-purpose computational silicon, but benefits from a longer and more involved design process optimizing the memory performance.\n\nIf the mining of such a coin became large enough and competitive enough, the ASICs would eventually win, but by a smaller margin. That extra general-purpose silicon isn't totally free, even if it's low-cost compared to the memory performance.\n\nAt a higher level, \"ASIC resistance\" means that the coin is being mined on general-purpose hardware. This means that the mining hardware has other uses, and therefore has resale or reuse value. That means that your miners aren't fully invested in the coin: if the price tanks, they can still get some of their investment back by selling their hardware (GPUs or whatever) on the secondary market. So \"ASIC resistant\" means that the incentives aren't as well lined up.",

Just not as complicated ones as Ethereum, which many regard as a feature and not a bug. \n\nEthereum has gas (you pay for the resources you use) while Bitcoin only has fees depending on your transaction size. This means Bitcoin and Ethereum can do different things. \n\nFor Bitcoin invalid transactions are processed for free and then simply not propagated throughout the network. This means complicated/expensive scripts could DOS the network. \n\nFor Ethereum this means even invalid transactions need to pay for gas. Which has the effect that EVERYTHING needs to pay for its own gas, including tokens (send a token and you still need Ether as well, which newbies don't get). \n\nIt is however VERY likely that Bitcoin will move towards a gas-like approach for more complicated scripts (or it will stagnate and die). And that simultaneously Ethereum will become more Bitcoin-like and allow simple scripts (limited gas) to evaluate to check whether a contract is willing to foot the bill (via some set-gas-limit operand).\n\n:)",

If you try to use it as a money making tool/investment, you're just gambling, making a bet that it's value will go up or that you'll manage to buy low and sell high on multiple short term occasions. I don't recommend gambling.\n\nIf you become intimately familiar with the way cryptocurrencies work and then feel particularly confident in the fundamentals of one currency, then \"investing\" in it will at least be a somewhat educated gamble but, even still, markets can be irrational, as I would argue they are now, and you never can know for sure what's going to happen.\n\nCrypto-currencies allow for near friction-less transaction, which has enormous benefits for vendors (so that they don't lose something crazy like 3% to VISA), people who need to send money to others cheaply (especially across borders, like for migrant workers), and applications that benefit from \"micro-transactions\". They also provide world class security to anyone who wants to flip a coin 160 times and, from that set of ones and zeros, generate an address to which anyone from anywhere in the world can send money for fractions of a penny. They allow the previously un-banked in the world the opportunity to participate in the global economy. There will be applications we can't even imagine being built on top of the blockchain, allowing for more efficient and effective methods of dealing with things like identity, ownership, and contracts.\n\nAre you interested in learning about that sort of stuff, or are you only concerned with investing to make money?",

Unless you are really implementing totally new cryptographical stuff. That happens very rarely and usually it's Bitcoin spearheading these things.\n\nSo, Bitcoin is kinda the maximum for security and decentralization. Other coins claiming to be faster, doing something extra like apps or total anonymity sacrifice on those things. So beaware, there is point in some sacrificies, but if we do too much of those we lose the main points of cryptocurrency: being unstoppable, trustlessness, permissionless, censorship and attack proof currency.\n\nThere is also couple cryptocurrencies which doesn't use blockchain (at least as in it traditional form), like Iota and Nano.",

I'd ask yourself questions like is Monero a good investment? Do I understand its tech? Do I think it will go up? Why? What's my time horizon? Is now a good time to buy? How much of my money to I really want to risk on this? \n\nYou can also start by just buying ETH/BTC/LTC or an index. There is a relationship between BTC and the other coins (obviously) but they don't necessarily mimic each other or work in some sort of predictable inverse. Hopefully, that helps you out a bit. \n",

Each node connects to other nodes in a giant network.\n\nYour wallet (or GDAX's) sends a transaction to the network, which is really just telling the nodes that are connected to it \"Hey, Wannapolkallama is sending X coins to Y address\" - from there, the nodes do a few verifications, making sure you haven't already spent those coins, for example, and say \"Everything looks good, I'll pass it along\" and sends it to another node. \n\nBlockcypher and Etherscan run nodes. Their websites basically list the transactions they've heard about from the network. The more spread out your nodes are, the faster you get transactions. \n\nMiners also use this list - they ask nodes for the top fee paying transactions, and the node sends that list to them. They then pick from those transactions to choose which to include in a block. When a miner finds a block, they also send a list on which transactions were in the block, and the nodes all write that to the global ledger. \n\n",

It sounds like that might make sense for you. \n\nA hardware wallet is a way to get some extra resiliency. With something like Exodus, if my computer crashes, my wallet (and money) are only recoverable with the 12-word seed. Hardware wallets protect against that, at the expense of being a little more hassle to use. \n\nI have not had any experience with a hardware wallet, but from what I've seen they typically expose some sort of lightweight browser interface you can access via a browser extension. Each one is different, I'm sure. This web interface then lets you do all the normal wallet things. ",

The most obvious way to tell is if you need to sign up for an account. If you don't, the keys are probably on your device. You should also backup your seed to somewhere/something separate to your phone. I write backup seeds in a notepad which I store in a lockbox at home. Paper is about at resilient as it gets for simple usage. If you have a lot of money in a single wallet, you might consider something even more robust, like imprinting your seed onto a sheet of metal.  ",

Make sure you use a reputable site to generate your paper wallet. \n\nAll a paper wallet is is your address and private key written on a pretty piece of paper. To access and spend coins as long as you have your private key and address you own those coins.  You can choose to encrypt the private key as well, so that you could keep copies of your paper wallet more places and you wouldn't have to be (as) worried about losing your coins as you would be if the private key were in plain-text. \n\nIf you choose to encrypt it, I would make sure to paste the encrypted key into the 'wallet details' of the site (linked) and make sure that you know how to get your unencrypted private key back. \n\nThe two things that are critical to know about paper wallet is that you can't let people see it that you don't trust to spend the money, and you need to keep the address so that you know your private key and address. Keep it safe, remember where all copies are and keep it secret.\n\nWhen you decide you want to spend your coins, you can get a wallet like electrum or your choice and choose to import or 'sweep' your address into your new wallet, and spend from there. \n\nI'm a big fan of paper wallets. Hope this helps if you decide to go this route. Again, paper wallets are probably best for hodlers. \n",

Do your research and decide whether you feel safer keeping it on the exchange until an updated wallet is available or if you feel comfortable enough with the current one. With iota transfers, do not use same address more than once as this can compromise your seed, and seed generation needs to be done securely. Don\u2019t use it without being well informed (esp iota paper wallet) as it\u2019s easy to get your coins taken. For main coins, I like hardware wallets but they cost $70-$125, so I\u2019d wait for bigger investments. My ether wallet is good for ethereum. ",

Where ever you put your coins thats where they are. Like money in a bank/wallet. The thing is with these its very easy to lose or misplace your money. Please read more before you play with your coin or attempt to send them. Much is happening in the crypto world the best thing for you to do as a beginner is to sit tight and enjoy the climb. I have created a discord channel where we post informative links to help others. \nhttps://discord.gg/rgw3M\nYou'll have to be logged into discord for this to work.

They have to be online to sell if your coins are on the site\n\n> Is it safe to keep my currency on coinbase or should I get a hardware wallet?\n\nIt's safe enough.  If loss of your coins would ruin your dinner, then no worries... leave them there.  If the loss would lead to a lifetime of regret... invest in a Trezor, they seem to be most recommended.  BTW.. [this](https://btc-e.com/index.html) was the last site I kept coins on for an extended period of time (lol)\n\n> If I get a hardware wallet and want to sell my coins, how do I do that?\n\nThe HW wallet keeps all the secrets (keys)... a software program plugs into the HW wallet and asks it to use the secrets to spend some bitcoin.  The HW wallet then gives the transaction to the software for it to send to the network to spend your coin as you have instructed.\n\n",

You create this \"paper\" or metal wallet with a hardware wallet. \n\n>A question I'm still unsure about: Such hardware wallets are independent of the Internet, aren't they?\n\nMost hardware wallets are used connected to the internet so should be considered as \"warm wallets\". They isolate the private key creation , storage , and tx signing so they are better than just using a software wallet alone however \n\n> Ledger.com eventually goes bankrupt and their app/website is offline? \n\nI would avoid that hardware wallet but most hardware wallets use standard BIP39 backups so can be used with other hardware or software wallets . It doesn't matter if the company disappears\n\n>?You still can\u2019t get to the Bitcoin because the hardware wallet only works with the Ledger.com website?\n\nThats not how hardware wallets work , you aren't forced to use trezor suite or ledger live . You can use hardware wallets with many independent software wallets \n\n> Do you still invest in other cryptocurrencies on a long-term basis?\n\n99% of altcoins are scams (not all are) but this is offtopic here\n\n>The problem is always the long-term and life expectancy\n\nThan just stick with bitcoin , because most altcoins will disappear or lose 99.9% of their value and are just pump and dumps",

Giving your seed phrase and password to *anyone* risks anything from their metal stamped seed words being compromised by your lawyer and your crypto stolen, to your family using social engineering or a bounty to steal your password from your lawyer, to them just deciding to team up with your lawyer to take your crypto.    \n\nDo you know what your lawyer's IT security protocols are? Is your lawyer resistant to data breaches? Who has access to your lawyer's offices?   \n\nIf you're going to use the metal plates method, go to a bank with lock boxes in an actual vault (not just locked drawers in a room), and leave the seedphrase there. The passphrase is now less critical. You have to assume that both your family and your lawyer have poor security habits, as most people don't know anything about security.\n\n\n*edit: tagging /u/MountainousFog for visibility*",

The \"private part\" is the key to unlock all the funds, like a password.  To find the private part, go to our bomb shelter and look on the third shelf behind the dehydrated water.  You will find a leather notebook labeled \"Bitcoin\".  It will tell you the private key and the instructions on how to redeem it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> Ensure you checked the balance (see above) before doing anything.  If you want to cash it in, but find this too confusing, just call Dave from the wallet recovery service (est. 2013).  If Dave is busy or can't cash in the funds, look at one of his competitors:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html#recovery\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> The customary fee for wallet recovery is 20%, which is why it's important for you to know the balance before you begin.  You can call our lawyer if you want to write up a contract for Dave or someone else.  Only show Dave the private parts when the contract is in place.  Remember, anyone who SEEs the private key can make off with all the funds.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> Hope this is of use, and not a burden.",

But what happens if you forget? What if you die? What is someone else knows and they torture you for the words?",

This will allow you to follow along with the examples in Mastering Bitcoin.\n\n3. Read [Programming Bitcoin](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=programming+bitcoin&crid=1ZXIW4S25YIY3&sprefix=programmin%2Caps%2C93&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10), in this book you will learn how to create Bitcoin from scratch using python. I recommend re-listening to Inventing Bitcoin during this to refresh yourself on the big ideas again.\n\n4. Read [Mastering Lightning](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Lightning-Network-Blockchain-Protocol/dp/1492054860/ref=sr_1_3?crid=12FXJOJ8BXV6Y&keywords=mastering+lightning+network&qid=1645863259&sprefix=mastering+light%2Caps%2C87&sr=8-3) this is by the author of the first book and will give a solid understanding of the lightning network. I also recommend listending to the audiobook Layered Money before or while you're reading this book to get a deeper understanding of building in layers.\n\nTips:\n\nAvoid BitSoy and BitSoy clones all together, really all YouTubers except for maybe Robert Breedlove's podcast, and some of Jack Maller's interviews.\n\nUnderstand Bitcoin is not written in any particular programming language, it's just a set of rules and a big distributed database. However the reference implementation called Bitcoin Core is written in C++, and most node providers use that as the standard.",

Well, the taxes part is, technically, but only if you sell the bitcoin for cash or cash equivalent. \n\nAnyone can setup a \"node.\" A node is a part of the network that assists with transactions, & is a core part of the infrastructure. You end up downloading all or a recent part of the blockchain, & your node helps verify transactions. Note: this is NOT the same thing as mining. \n\nThis node then becomes your wallet, as well. \n\nThen, you can acquire crypto a few different ways without purchasing via Paypal and such. It could be as simple as giving cash to a friend who is willing to buy via a centralized exchange. It could be as involved as setting up your own mining rig. Either way, you can get coin that is anonymous. \n\nHowever, anonymity & privacy aren't necessarily the point. They CAN be, and there a projects dedicated to that. But, the point at a larger scale, is a more democratic monetary system. In the case of most cryptocurrency right now, that resulted in non-private blockchains. But there's no philosophical reason that has to be the case, it was just the simplest secure way for the first iterations. \n\nFinally, it's important to understand WHY cryptocurrency is more democratic. Open source code is at the core of it. Anyone can look at the code, & draw conclusions from it. That doesn't mean everyone has to or should, but they can. But this means the currency is FAIR. There's no central bank printing money for someone else while you & I are left in the lurch. With crypto, you, the big guys, & I, all play by the same rules. \n\nTaxes? Death & taxes & all that. They only tax when you sell. So buy, hodl, spend. No selling.",

The big difference is that \u201cregular\u201d money (let\u2019s talk about $USD) is controlled by one central entity (the federal reserve) and is comes with a host of issues because of that. You can learn a lot more about it if you go watch some intro videos or do some reading. \n\nTo answer your questions: \n-\tBitcoin can be anonymous. Most exchanges/wallets record your personal identifying info as a legal precaution to protect themselves. You can get an anonymous wallet right now. Go look up \u201cpaper wallets\u201d. \n-\tYou actually don\u2019t need 3rd parties to use it. You can go meet someone in person and buy Bitcoin from them. You can install software on your computer and send/receive money yourself. This software is open source and non profit. You could write the software yourself. It\u2019s just way easier for people to use 3rd parties when they don\u2019t know how else to do it. Again, go do some reading. This stuff is really easy to find.  \n-\tsure, you have to pay taxes on it. We all have to pay taxes on everything. But if someone were trying to commit tax fraud and avoid the IRS, they could (pretty easily) go get an anonymous wallet, make anonymous transactions, and hold/spend money away from the eyes of the IRS. Again, that\u2019s tax fraud, but it\u2019s pretty easy to do with Bitcoin if you wanted to hide your assets. Just because I feel like I need to say it based on your questions - Don\u2019t do tax fraud. You won\u2019t win. It\u2019s not worth it.",

Of the major benefits I personally feel Bitcoin has for example, none of them are mentioned in your list, and certainly wouldn't count as \"regular money\".\n\nSaying that - none of the 3 bullet points you've mentioned are necessary true of Bitcoin itself (it's not truly anonymous, but not for the reasons of having to give personal details).\n\nBitcoin is a decentralised currency, and does not require for you to give personal details, interact with an exchange or pay tax.\n\nWhat you are describing are how to bring the currency into a centralised system. If you have to pay tax, that's the law of your personal country. It isn't in Bitcoin's protocol magically absolves you of paying taxes.",

It is a negligible %age of global energy use, similar to the energy use of online streaming services, and serval times less that of gold mining, and less than the power used by devices on standby in the US alone. It is also one of the most renewable industries already, and will be a useful component in subsidising green energy generation technologies. It is not a major contributor of global warming emissions, it's not even close.\n\n...And then what critics will do 9 times out of 10 when this is pointed out, is pivot instead to '*Well, it's still a \\*waste\\* of energy*\" - essentially showing their actual colours they they think bitcoin shouldn't exist and needs to justify itself to them. \n\nThankfully, nobody has unilateral authority to assign what consitutes a 'waste' of energy. A mechanism to move any amount of value across any geopolitical boundary almost instantly with no counterparty risk or authority oversight on the most most secure network with the hardest asset on earth is evidently useful in the eyes of the global free market.",

Privacy serves utility to more than just criminals. It\u2019s a critical piece of ensuring Bitcoin retains its censorship resistant properties. Also, it\u2019s more traceable than you might think. Technologies like CoinJoin transactions, HD wallets, and Lightning Network are making it more difficult to trace - but that\u2019s a good thing to the world and a bad thing for authoritarians. If you\u2019re concerned about traceability, just look up some of the recent major investigations. You\u2019ll quickly see that the transparency of the blockchain actually aids regulators and investigators in this regard in many ways, much better than what fiat transactions offer.\n\n3. Check out these Twitter resources. Bitcoins energy use is also a highly complex topic. But to start, if you can\u2019t see the value of a trustless, global, interdiction resistant, privacy preserving, deflationary monetary system then you will likely see any energy use as a waste. Almost all improvements to civilization have required energy (look at washing machines, cars). Bitcoin is no different. It\u2019s up to the people to determine if that energy use is worthwhile. https://mobile.twitter.com/mtcbtc/status/1346813481257984001\n\nEdit - I\u2019d also encourage you to research the Lightning Network. It addresses some of your concerns. Also the energy use per transaction statistic is highly misleading. Many transactions can be bundled into one, there are second layer solutions like lightning network that only do final settlement of many transactions on the base layer blockchain, etc. Looking at energy use on a per transaction basis just isn\u2019t a representative metric of what is driving the energy consumption",

With points 2 or 3, anybody's nan who decided to do a 5-10 minutes objectives research would have found the rebuttals to these critiques by now. Whether you agree that those rebuttals are valid is another matter. but there's simply no excuse to present your post as if these critiques have remained unchallenged. And so I won't use up my time addressing #2 and #3.\n\nSo with Point #1...\n\nwell someone's already mentioned how BTC may be seen as a store of value, but let's instead adopt your hypothesis of BTC becoming the *sole* global currency.\n\nPersonally I don't think people are not going to cease purchasing goods.... because they will always have a need for goods. To imply they would starve themselves to death is unrealistic, and to imply they will make themselves homeless by waiting for the bottom of a \"bottomless housing bear market\" is also unrealistic.\n\nSo as long as there is market demand for something, there is always profit in businesses creating goods and services. Furthermore, decreasing prices will probably pressurise businesses into increasing their product quality in order to be competitive.\n\nYeah perhaps sometimes we need to step out of the economy books for a second or two.",

For the cost of a wallet you have peace of mind, and the \"several hundred pounds\" is based on today's value.

Recent gallup poll reflect great approval ratings though \n\n95% in handling of the pandemic,\n86% in education ,\n85% in health,\n81% in security\n\nand even his critics call him a bit of a dictator , which isn't great but also means he will likely remain in office many more years if his critics are right that he is somewhat of a dictator which has the benefit of allowing this project to potentially be completed",

Many countries that have had some sort of ban in the past with Bitcoin have reversed this ban because they can't stop Bitcoin usage and it makes them seem inept. \n\nFor the USA a ban is unlikely for these reasons \n\n1) The Trendon Shavers case gave legal precedent that Bitcoin is not an illegal security according to the Howey test\n\n2) The IRS has already formalized how it treats Bitcoin (as an asset)\n\n3) Many wealthy and highly connected individuals have personally invested in Bitcoin and they wont be too happy if their peers in politics make Bitcoin illegal\n\n4) Traditional Fintech in the USA like ICE/BAKKT(owner of NYSE) , Fidelity, TD ameritrade, CME, and more are already directly involved in Bitcoin mining, investing and trading.\n\n5) Exchanges like coinbase, square, gemini , and more already are very large companies heavily involved in Bitcoin\n\n6) Many local states have both case law and legislation on Bitcoin making it more difficult to make illegal\n\n7) There is plenty of existing case law in US courts that have shown encryption and code to fall under the 1st amendment protections\n\n8)\tMaking it illegal would not stop bitcoin but just reflect they are a totalitarian government and an inept one at that because stopping Bitcoin is far more difficult than winning the war on drugs\n>\u201cI think we were past that point [of banning Bitcoin in the US] very early on because you\u2019d have to shut down the internet,\u201d Peirce said. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you could ban it.

And just keep learning about that rather than its value in the FIAT world. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.s. Just giving advice from my worst actions when I first bought some lol.

If the exchange rate was 1 BTC = 41&nbsp;334 EUR, then 0.00011 BTC = 4.55 EUR, not 4.92 EUR.\n\nThe (taker) trade fee on Kraken is 0.26%, so you should've paid a trade fee of 0.02 EUR and then purchased 4.98 EUR worth of BTC, which at an exchange rate of 1 BTC = 41&nbsp;334 EUR would be 0.00012048 BTC.\n\nCheck your trade history to confirm the exchange rate at the time you made the purchase, and the amount of BTC you received. It's possible that there was some [slippage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp) at purchase time, and thus that you still have a small amount of EUR in your account as a result, e.g. 4.92 EUR was spent to purchase BTC, then 0.02 EUR trade fee was paid, leaving 0.06 EUR still in your account.\n\n**EDIT:** Kraken also does some rounding/truncation on their main front-end, so you may be seeing \"0.00011 BTC\" but actually have slightly more. Visit the \"expert\" trading site at https://trade.kraken.com/ to see your balances in full precision (8 decimal places for BTC).",

If a youtuber says bitcoin will reach 100k dont buy, if a youtuber says bitcoin is going to crash to 10k dont sell. Buy bitcoin and dont look at the charts for 5 years, wait for the next halving. When you're satisfied sell. Hodl and wait for a long period of time. Dont expect to get rich overnight! When your crypto portfolio reaches 1000$ ( or whatever you feel is a significant amount ) purchase a hardware wallet. Do not store your crypto on exchanges, not your keys not your crypto. Keep your crypto on software wallets until you get a hardware wallet. I recommend Exodus software wallet as it is beginner friendly. Very important keep your seed phrase/recovery phrase on PAPER ONLY. Never take a picture of it. Never store it online or never save it as a text file on your computer. Dont listen to private messages 100% are scammers. Common scam terms are synchronize your wallet/initialize your wallet/connect your wallet to dapps to avoid synchronization errors, etc and they usually send you to websites that ask for your seed phrase and then the scammer takes 10 minutes to empty your wallet and run away with your money.",

This is especially true with Bitcoin because no one can predict the price and most appreciation happens on a few days each year that are unexpected so the quicker you own BTC , the quicker you get exposure to this appreciation.\n\nThis being said you should not be investing at all in Bitcoin unless you have paid off all your high interest debt and have at least 3-6 months of fiat in an emergency fund to cover living expenses.\n\nLump sum investing outperformed DCA investing 68% of the time according to a Vanguard study -\n\nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/dollar-cost-averaging-what-investors-need-to-know.aspx\n\n2 reasons -\n\n1) stocks (I suggest an index fund like SPDR ) and BTC have an inherent upwards bias so the sooner you invest the quicker you can accumulate appreciation\n\n2) Inflation drag - fiat uninvested will be slowly losing value due to inflation",

The passphrase would be backed up but kept separately from the 12 to 24 word seed.\n\nAlso there is a third problem with that term as it insinuates that there are only 24 word seed backups and the passphrase is the \"25th word\" which is also wrong. Seed word backups can be 12, 15, 18, 21, or 24 , with 12 being the most common.\n\n>How would we set it up so that our younger family members inherit the cryptocurrencies?\n\nyou can tell the location of your seed words in your will you store in a safety deposit box or with a lawyer or another hidden time capsule that is revealed somehow (dead mans switch), the passphrase should be revealed another way as to never have the seed words and passphrase in the same location at the same time.",

Give specific instructions to recover your will only upon death.\n\nHave the envelop have a tamper proof sticker and placed in such a specific manner as you can identify any person finding it and looking at it. Periodically , every year or 6 months , check to see if the will has been looked at or tampered with. If it has, you know to change the passphrase and know not to trust that family member. \n\nThus any dishonest family member will only get access to the passphrase and will not have access to the safety deposit box (do not leave the key to the safety deposit box with your will , upon death the courts will award the deposit box as indicated in the will they will have). Additionally, any bank employee, thief , or court order will only get access to your decoy wallet and not your real one if they compromise your safety deposit box \n\n--------\n\nAnother option is to use multisig or a multisig service like CASA",

Might just as good use one and split and mix the coins afterwards if you want. \n\nIf you just care that your friend doesn\u2019t know your balance, then keeping withdrawals on separate addresses is enough. \n\nNow using the lightning network solves these privacy concerns.

Bitcoin can handle millions of transactions per second , that are private , a fraction of a penny and get instant confirmations. Just use a lightning wallet \n\n> what I can see the power consumption from PoW is a real issue. \n\nThis notion comes  from a flawed understanding of economics. Fiat currency and PoS coins cost at least the same amount of resources to  create , regulate and secure as Bitcoin.\n\nThere is an inescapable reality for any asset or currency that as it increases in value the production costs and costs to secure increase as well . This is demonstrated in the economic axiom: MC=MR\n\n\u201cRent\u201d always forces production costs (MC) to always equal sale prices (MR)\n\nPoS currencies and fiat are simply more abstract and complex forms or Proof of Work that use more human involvement (which uses tremendous amounts of resources and has a tremendous environmental impact) as a PoW coin like Bitcoin. Humans instead of ASICs are shouldering more of the work to create, regulate , and secure each of those currencies; This is \"work\" whether it involves burning electricity directly or food and electricity that humans consume  to perform their work. This is an inescapable economic reality. The more valuable something is the more it will cost to secure it because the more effort will be made to steal and or control it. This applies to any currency or asset.\n\nThis is also better understood with the dollar auction dilemma. In a hypothetical auction where a bidding war is fighting over the right to mint a 1 dollar bill how much do you think people will be willing to spend for this power ?\n\n---------------\n\nBitcoin is the only Cryptocurrency proven itself to be secure and decentralized\n\n99% of altcoins/ICOs are scams and its difficult to evaluate them unless you know the history of these projects and are a programmer yourself so can evaluate their claims\n\nAltcoins will come and go as we have always seen but bitcoin having a first mover advantage means that it is has the most network effect and best chance of surviving longterm \n\nOne of the primary reasons Bitcoin was created was to have a sound monetary policy and digital scarcity , and being a multicoiner undermines all of this\n\nUsing wallets and software that supports multiple coins is confusing  and can lead to mistakes where you can lose money and makes the software far more insecure with a wider attack surface and potential for bugs and exploits \n\nWhen looking at the long term graphs , most altcoins pump and dump and lose value relative to Bitcoin. \n\nGetting involved with altcoins forces you to spend a ton of extra time learning complex and obscure projects \n\nScammers prefer to target people that use altcoins as we saw with the ICO craze because Bitcoiners tend to have more experience and be more skeptical to evaluate their claims\n\nBeing involved in altcoins usually means you don't have long term time preferences and simply want to speculate short term which many people will consider a character flaw because you are more of a gambler \n\nBitcoin has an uphill battle as is so any distractions weakens the possibility of it becoming a global p2p currency (Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency that can achieve this with its network effect and roadmap)\n\n------------------\n\nWhy Proof of work is important -\n\n1) They do not legally fit the Howey test as a security. This is not merely an opinion but tested case law in the USA. \n\n2) A similar amount of effort in securing the coin must be invested to be rewarded the coin creating long term incentives in the project and making it very costly to attack it. Miners who have sunk infrastructure costs on mining a particular algo, especially with ASICs\n\n3)  Fair Coin Distribution.  No scammy ICO , premine or instamine is created and miners are forced to sell most of their coins to cover the expense (mainly ASICs + electricity) which allows a fair distribution and competition in the minting process.\n\n4) Since mining BTC is so competitive, profit margins are typically thin and thus new entrants that either use a better tool to mine (ASIC) or find cheaper sources of power(typically green due to the economics) can quickly gain market share making lasting monopolies difficult. Even if a main ASIC manufacturer appears to have a large market share we can see this quickly change due to a single malinvestment or a mistake when developing the newest ASIC. Power is a resource that comes from many sources and allows many locations around the world to remain competitive for unique reasons. \n\n5) Objective Security- Proof of work gives us an objective and measurable degree of security where risk assessments can be made with greater precision that isn't afforded with more subjective forms of security.\n\n5)\tThere is no company that controls a pure PoW coin in many cases thus the project will win or fail on its own merit and doesn't have a long burn rate created by speculators",

                    "response": ">Why every blockchain or blockchain project coming out have to have a cryptocurrency attached to it?\n\nThis is an excellent question. Most of the projects have absolutely no need for a token or internal currency as software and code can interact with bitcoin and other tokens. Most altcoins are scams , fads, or pump and dumps and **the only reason this internal currency exists is to fundraise or make the creators/early investors wealthy.** These projects are usually extremely centralized and act more like unregulated companies creating an illegal security to raise capital.\n\nThis is why being 100% proof of work is so important as it removes the concerns attracting attention from regulators because you no longer satisfy the Howey test as being considered a security and you insure a fair coin distribution where anyone can mine and miners are forced to distribute most of their coins to cover costs.\n\nNow let\u2019s discuss perverse incentives these types of ICOs create- \n\n1) With traditional fundraising(VC + Angel) savvy and accredited investors can properly investigate and vet a companies plan, product, and creators unlike the type of investors that these ICOs attract that just prefer to speculate and don't really care many times if it is a scam or not. This creates pumps and dumps and temporary distortions of price. \n\n2) With traditional fundraising the investors typically get a **legal** stake in the company so have aligned interests in the company succeeding longterm, unlike with ICOs where many of the investors are interested in short term profits and are happy to jump from one project to the next. These tokens they are selling give no legal ownership to the underlying company that is promoting this security like shares in a company do. \n\n3) Giving most of the money upfront with little sales , an unfinished product and a yet to be established client base creates perverse incentives to \n\n>a) Incentivize the creators and lead devs to build up this project just enough so it looks they  tried, dump it and start another ICO for more free money. We have seen this time and time again with devs like Daniel Larimer. \n\n>b) Incentivize the business to spend too much and not receive crucial feedback from sales they depend on because they have so much funding upfront. There is a reason traditional investing typically has a strict contract between thee investor and the business , with staged payouts , and multiple rounds of funding , where conditions are set and the investors sometimes even get a vote on the board. There is a reason VC investment typically waits to invest until their is some proven sales or client acquisition before investing. All of this is not the case with ICOs of this nature.\n\n4) The free floating speculative nature of their investment creates a perverse incentive to focus on marketing and promoting rather than security , utility, and product development. This is not the case with stable investments like we see where VC slowly invests fiat or is allowed to control in a contract how the fiat is spent. \n\n5) The fact that many of these ICOs keep a majority of their tokens allows them to easily manipulate the price due to most of the utility being frozen and in their control. This makes their \"blockchain\" very centralized and controlled. \n\n6) Getting a large amount of funding upfront allows the company to offer various bribes to affiliates, exchanges, oracles, and coin leaderboard lists to promote and sell their coin. Unlike with a project that starts humble and has to be vetted by everyone based upon merit alone because they don't have this funding to bribe others with. \n\n7) The fact that this ICO fits the Howey tests it opens up this company for lawsuits as we see actively occurring right now and future regulation and fines putting investors at risk",

Additionally, fiat currencies like the dollar, euro and yuan have deep entrenched network effects that are difficult to overcome . This is the same reason that Bitcoin is most likely going to be the candidate of being the worlds p2p decentralized money (monetary policy, security, liquidity and network effect being far superior to altcoins ). \n\nThe most we will likely see IMHO in our lifetimes is many countries hedging their reserve assets in Bitcoin + GOLD or Bitcoin + world reserve fiat like USD (example = El Salvador) or possibly getting rid of gold altogether as a reserve asset due to asteroid mining and just using Bitcoin. Additionally, I can foresee many countries becoming dual currency countries (like already exists throughout the world) where they accept their local fiat and Bitcoin for day to day txs. \n\n>how do you determine its value.\n\nThe same way this is done today. All Currency, commodities, and Assets derive their value subjectively from humans. \n\nhttps://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value\n\nThis is usually done with trading pairs. \n\nBitcoin/fiat or Bitcoin/gold or Bitcoin/altcoins \n\nAs you can see, trading pairs exist between commodities and money as well so you do not need fiat or altcoins to exist to determine value. \n\n>today's world 1 bitcoin's value is determined how much it is traded and expressed in US Dollars\n\nThis is incorrect. Bitcoin has many trading pairs outside of USD . USD could completely disappear and Bitcoin can still determine its purchasing price in the free market. \n\n>Why crypto currency are an investment majorly as of now and nothing else?\n\nI spend and replace my bitcoin almost everyday as p2p money and many others do as well. To answer your question about why most of it is speculative :\n\nBitcoin is going through the normal stages of becoming a currency.\n\nCollectible>Asset/commodity>volatile currency>Stable unit of account currency\n\nRight now Bitcoin is between stage 2 and 3. \n\nBitcoin is superior to fiat and gold in many ways already but a great problem for adoption as a currency is volatility . We hope volatility will drop in time with higher liquidity and UX keeps improving every year. \n\n>learn more about Web3 and Blockchain technology.\n\nMost of this is a scam buzzword for marketing so be careful and watch this :\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un1CegKO1xo\n\n>What are some good resources\n\nI would suggest learning the basics first \n\nhttps://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html\n\nhttps://www.lopp.net/lightning-information.html\n\nhttps://10hoursofbitcoin.com/\n\nhttp://bitcoinrabbithole.org/\n\nhttps://bitcoin-resources.com\n\nhttps://www.bitcoin101.club\n\nhttps://21lessons.com\n\n>I have these genuine doubts \n\nIt is 100% right to be skeptical , this ecosystem is filled with lies and scams.

Yes , none of us knows the future and frankly I also don't agree with the s2f model but inflation alone even at 8% a year can drive bitcoin to much higher prices easily. \n\n5 million usd = 1 million usd in todays purchasing power over 20 years at 8% inflation. At 4% you are looking at 2.2 million to equal todays purchasing power of a mere 1 million\n\nThus what some would suggest is an absurd projected valuation isn't so absurd when you adjust for inflation",

Thanks for the answer.\n\nAs I think about it more people can make new versions of bitcoin but there is not the ability to make an infinite number of these complex networks. I imagine this imposes a limit on the number of useable cryptocurrencies that can be created. Plus I imagine it\u2019s a natural monopoly so bitcoin will always have an advantage unless something vastly superior comes along.",

As I said, if you wanted to switch to a Bitcoin with more supply, you can create yours, but then you need everyone to switch to it if you want it to be a success. This can theoretically happen if there is extreme consensus of increasing the supply, which will never happen.\n\nThe absolute scarcity of Bitcoin is not a problem because bitcoin is very divisible. Thus as the value increases (because of limited supply and increasing demand), there is always enough decimals to use. This is also very different than increasing the supply, as you do not \"create more matter\" (you can divide a pizza into ever tiny pieces but you do not have more pizza in the end). Read https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/qa9tfa/is_bitcoin_the_best_at_anything_anonymity/hh1lwyx?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3\n\nThe divisibility can be increased on layers. Right now 1 BTC = 100,000,000 sat. But on the Lightning Network a sat is also divisible into smaller units.\n\nAnd if we needed, we could also increase the divisibility on-chain, which would extend the halving schedule, but that would require extreme consensus again. Read https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/oa9oaq/how_reducing_bitcoins_smallest_unit_of_account/\n\n\nu/bitusher will give you a better answer if he wants to.",

                    "response": "Coins are always \"stored\" on the blockchain (with a bit of abuse of terminology), regardless of what wallet you use.\n\nA Bitcoin wallet only contains the keys to access your funds. This is true for a hardware wallet, a desktop application or a mobile app.\n\nThe important aspect to consider is how easy it is for an attacker to steal your keys. Because if someone obtains your keys, they control your funds and can then send them to an address of their own. Devices that are connected to the internet are by definition more vulnerable. There exists malware designed specifically to steal keys from common wallet apps. Windows software is particularly vulnerable, because there's so much malware for that platform.\n\nHardware wallets are designed to never expose the keys to the internet. Even when a hardware wallet is connected to a computer, the keys stay within the secure chip on the hardware wallet. The computer sends messages to the wallet with requests to sign transactions and the wallet sends the signed transactions back. Meanwhile, the keys stay where they are.\n\nWith each type of wallet, you need to consider how you create a backup of the keys, so you can restore access if you ever lose your wallet. Many wallets these days support a common standard: BIP39. This translates your \"master key\" (or seed) into a list of 12 to 24 words. This standard is supported by both hardware wallets, desktop wallets and mobile wallets. And it is cross-compatible between them. You could, for example, take the word list from a hardware wallet and restore it on a software wallet. Note that some wallets may have other backup methods instead of or in addition to the word list.\n\nKeep in mind that for security purposes, where your keys are is important. If you take the word list from a hardware wallet and restore it on a software wallet, you lose the protection of the hardware wallet. And vice versa, taking a seed from a software wallet and loading it onto a hardware wallet doesn't suddenly give you the protection of a hardware wallet, because the seed may still have leaked from the software wallet.\n\nFinally, there's a special type of wallet that doesn't follow the above: Custodial wallets. With a custodial wallet, you don't actually manage the keys to your funds. Instead, the wallet operator keeps the keys and allows you to access your funds through their platform. Custodial wallets are like bank accounts. They have some advantages (keeping the keys secure is no longer your responsibility), but also some major disadvantages (the operator can simply decide to close your account or to impose hefty fees).\n\nThere are many wallets that manage multiple cryptocurrencies. Though if your collection is very broad, you may not be able to find a single wallet that covers them all (except perhaps for custodial wallets offered by exchanges).",

When you're using a spread you're just buying at that amount at the time, you'll see for example that you'll have like 15 seconds or so to hit \"OK\", after that the price changes and you have another 15 seconds to hit the \"OK\" button again. It's using a spread so if BTC is priced at $40,000, using a spread you might see that it's more like $40200 when you bought it.\n\nCoinbase basic sucks as far as fees go, you'll not see me defend that, it's something like a $3 fee plus if you buy $100 plus the spread.\n\nCoinbase Pro you can set limit buy/sells that buys your order once the price hits that mark, then all you pay is the maker/taker fee, which is pennies compared to the $3 fee + spread. If BTC is currently at $43k but you want to buy at $39k, then you can set a limit buy and it'll fill it once it hits that mark. Pretty nice really.\n\nIs Coinbase Pro the best? Eh. FTX won't allow you buy less than BTC 0.0001, so you always end up w/ some change you have to convert, so it's kinda annoying, but it has better maker/taker fees (you can get a permanent discount on fees if you sign up through the Coin Bureau's page as well).\n\nAnywhere that you can buy BTC easily works for me. FTX & Coinbase Pro allows you link a bank account w/out going through Plaid, so win IMO.\n\nRobinhood has a lot of hate, they also have  a lot of lawsuits, so there's that..",

Gemini active trader has less fees \n\n>shouldn't there be any taxes here, no matter how many times I transfer to this hardware wallet? \n\nMoving bitcoin is not a taxable event \n\n> I would capture everything with screenshots and Excel spreadsheets. Or how do you document your transactions?\n\nYou don't need to do this as exchanges allow you to print out yearly reports \n\n> Can anyone recommend a good hardware wallet?\n\nCold card is my favorite , but other ones are listed in the FAQ\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/g42ijd/faq_for_beginners/\n\n>So paper wallets are nonsense?\n\nObsolete paper wallets with private keys are dangerous. Newer paper wallets with 12 to 24 seed words are ways to backup your wallet . You create this \"paper\" or metal wallet with a hardware wallet. \n\n>A question I'm still unsure about: Such hardware wallets are independent of the Internet, aren't they?\n\nMost hardware wallets are used connected to the internet so should be considered as \"warm wallets\". They isolate the private key creation , storage , and tx signing so they are better than just using a software wallet alone however \n\n> Ledger.com eventually goes bankrupt and their app/website is offline? \n\nI would avoid that hardware wallet but most hardware wallets use standard BIP39 backups so can be used with other hardware or software wallets . It doesn't matter if the company disappears\n\n>?You still can\u2019t get to the Bitcoin because the hardware wallet only works with the Ledger.com website?\n\nThats not how hardware wallets work , you aren't forced to use trezor suite or ledger live . You can use hardware wallets with many independent software wallets \n\n> Do you still invest in other cryptocurrencies on a long-term basis?\n\n99% of altcoins are scams (not all are) but this is offtopic here\n\n>The problem is always the long-term and life expectancy\n\nThan just stick with bitcoin , because most altcoins will disappear or lose 99.9% of their value and are just pump and dumps",

They're just a way for Binance to make more money as almost all of the fee you pay to them for a withdrawal ends up in their pockets.\n\nThe actual fee of sending BTC to a legacy address is exactly the same as the fee of sending to a segwit address. The segwit fee advantage can be had only when the funds are coming from a segwit address, the destination address type is irrelevant. Note that legacy and segwit are not separate networks.

Efficiency, conscientiousness, discipline- pretty much the traits that lead to all existential advancements. Right now there is no incentive to save dollars because we know it will only lose value.  Also, the depreciating dollar is constantly pulling the rug out from anyone who is economically marginalized and trying to get an economic foothold so they can better their life. An appreciating currency rewards saving, and takes the power of economic social control away from the central banks who print money and give it to their friends for free at the expense of the masses. And eventually, whether in retirement or otherwise, people will sell whatever assets they have (unless they take loans against it) which will move the asset back into circulation (if we consider an appreciating currency an asset).  Thinking about an appreciating unit of currency vs. a depreciating unit of currency does require a fundamental shift in the way you conceptualize money, and how that money shapes thought and society.",

During period of high deflation(appreciation) tx velocity tends to increase and merchant processors actually see an increase in spending for goods and services and charitable giving in Bitcoin.\n\nThis is believed to be caused by the feeling of newfound wealth(because they are wealthier) eventually overrides their desire to \"hoard\" (when did savings become a negative thing?) their Bitcoin.\n\nOf course more data needs to confirm this and as we enter another bull cycle(rapid deflation) it looks like we will get another round of data to confirm this.\n\nBitcoin is already testing some economic theories and proving them somewhat inaccurate but the data gathering is far from over and we all have a lot to learn .\nI personally suspect that what matters for a viable currency besides these other properties discussed here\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/gnzeeo/will_bitcoin_ever_be_adopted_by_the_general_public/frcry8f/\n\nIs stability and thus either low and predictable inflation or low and predictable deflation (1-4%) can both be suitable. As Bitcoins market cap grows and monetary inflation drops it appears that we will likely see very low deflation (occasionally people losing some coins) which is perfectly fine because the market will factor those expectations into consideration for loans and debt.\n________________________________________\nI personally prefer slight deflation for these reasons :\n\n1)\tEncourages people to invest in things they really need instead of unnecessary fluff and short term desires which is good for society and the environment\n\n2)\tencourages more savings instead of debt slavery which removes choice, confidence and power away from individuals\n\n\n3)\tkeeps fiat currency in check where too much inflation will cause more capital flight to Bitcoin and prevents corrupt governments from abusing the backdoor tax of inflation\n\n4) Reduces the negative cantillon effect of fiat by removing some of the control over currency from a small group of people that is in part due to fiat being inflationary\nhttps://fee.org/articles/the-cantillon-effect-because-of-inflation-we-re-financing-the-financiers/",

If on the other hand, you believe that the exchange can take care of your coins better than you can (I prefer to have them in the exchange than in a hot wallet) you can diversify the risk of loss by having part in your hard wallet and part in the exchange, but then their security will not depend on you but on a third party, which is not necessarily wrong.   \n\n\n*\\*Just so as not to create misunderstandings, I would like to clarify that \"cryptocurrencies\" are in the blockchain, not in the hardware wallet. The hardware wallet holds the private keys that allow the use of those coins, not the coins themselves.*",

If an attacker finds out the number you've registered with an exchange or custodial wallet, they can attempt a SIM-swap attack and get the number moved to a SIM they control and from that point onward receive all SMS messages sent to it.\n\nIdeally, your coins should not be in a custodial wallet at all, but should be managed with a hardware wallet or a properly secured software wallet on a device you own.\n\nBut if that's not an option (for example if you're trading), then you should use proper two-factor-authentication. The most common, secure form of 2FA is TOTP (Time-based One Time Passwords), which is frequently linked with the Google Authenticator app, although the TOTP system is an open standard and many alternative apps exist for it. TOTP apps don't need an internet connection once installed (although they do need a clock that's somewhat accurate), so you can just use an old smartphone or tablet for this purpose.",

However, although the withdrawal fees at kraken are among the cheapest I have seen (among the major exchanges), it is still considerably more expensive than sending from wallet to wallet paying only the mining fee. That is, if you're only going to make a one-time payment, that's fine, but if you're likely to pay more stuff I'd withdraw a sufficient amount to a wallet of mine (hot or, preferably cold) and make payments from there to pay only the mining fee. Otherwise you are paying in addition the kraken fee. \n\nKraken warns you that it is an exchange and not a wallet because you don't have your private keys in the first place, so you don't actually \"own\" your bitcoin. You have Kraken's promise that the moment you want to withdraw your bitcoin you will be able to do it, but it is only a promise. When you withdraw the bitcoin to your personal wallet then you ARE in possession of the private keys and consequently you can consider those cryptocurrencies yours.",

If there is a problem with your payment from exchange account to third party, then your support request needs to negotiate the problem of working out if the recipient is mistaken, or if Kraken failed to send. It's your problem, but you're not the sender or the recipient  \n\nIf you withdraw to your own wallet, then as the recipient, you can negotiate with Kraken if there are problems with the withdrawal payment. And then, when you send from your own wallet, you have a record of the transaction, the recipient address, fees, and the ability to prove the truth of the transaction to the recipient  \n\nNext year, there will be regulations requiring you to provide the name and address of the recipient, if you send from your exchange account to a third party. Do you know the recipient's name and address? Are you comfortable with the requirement to send this information to an exchange?  \n\nBitcoin is not PayPal. An exchange account is not a wallet.

You can't expect each teacher to know everything. They are a collection of people whom can impart knowledge of their specific expertise onto the student. The student's expertise becomes a synthesis of their collective knowledge.",

                    "response": "Do only buy BTC. \n\nNever buy any altcoins. They are all scams. \n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a miracle. \n\nhttps://armantheparman.com/why-bitcoin-only/\n\nI want to start by stressing that it all comes down to scarcity. Without scarcity, cryptocurrency may as well be fiat. Good money is scarce. The biggest weakness of cryptocurrencies is that they can be created easily from nothing. All alts are like this. But Bitcoin is different. It has miraculously been born and has gained a huge lead in network effects. This can not be copied. Thus, it has gained scarcity. It is extremely decentralised, and has by far the greatest hashing power on the planet, and distribution of full nodes, which makes it not possible to tamper with the monetary policy. Bitcoin has scarcity due to network effect lead and \u201cun-tamper-ability\u201d.\n\nThe Lindy effect will only make it stronger as day after day it doesn\u2019t die. It can\u2019t be eradicated, just like a cancer that has spread too far.\n\nThe copies cannot compete with this. It needs the majority to not only leave Bitcoin, but mostly leave to the same choice. There are thousands of choices, so those few people that abandon Bitcoin will not all go to the same choice. In other words, defectors will disperse, not concentrate. The only way this could theoretically happen is if there is some fatal flaw with Bitcoin, AND it can\u2019t be fixed, AND an altcoin can, AND only one altcoin can.\n\nE.g. let\u2019s say Bitcoin\u2019s privacy weakness (really it\u2019s a trade off, not a weakness and any other coin with privacy just chooses a different trade off) is suddenly critical and everyone is exiting. Where will they go? Monero, Zcash, DASH, some to ETH and XRP (not private btw), Cardano\u2026. Can they all be money? Money printer go brrrr much?\n\nSo how else can an Altcoin take over? Remember that people will save in the best money. An Altcoin must become fundamentally better. In the open source world, how is that possible? It\u2019s like thinking it\u2019s possible for a better operating system to exist than the dominant open source one today (GNU Linux). The open source leader just gets better and better. All new ideas get absorbed.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine another currency finds a good use case. Let\u2019s say smart contracts. First that\u2019s like saying paper is money and valuable because contracts can be written on it. No, you need to make good money first, not find other uses for it. Aluminium has more uses than gold but it\u2019s less valuable because it is not money. It can\u2019t be money because it is not scarce. But even if smart contracts makes a cryptocurrency into good money, there are too many: ETH, Cardano, TRON, Iota, probably others.\n\nAs soon as any becomes valuable, it will invite competition and it will be copied. There is no scarcity. For goodness sake, ETH doesn\u2019t even work yet. Its Turing completeness is not even used. Bitcoin has smart contract capability and I understand nearly everything ETH is doing program-wise can be done with Bitcoin. Let\u2019s face it, it is competing with Bitcoin as a money and is far far behind and has no credibility. What will Vitalik Buterin do with the monetary policy next?\n\nETH is just another fiat with a central banker. That is not a true cryptocurrency. Remember why Bitcoin was born \u2013 we are fighting central banking and trying to separate money and state, not shoot ourselves in the foot by losing focus, trying to get rich by improving on the solution we already miraculously discovered. Bitcoin is that: a miracle \u2013 and we should embrace it.\n\nAlso, you mention ROI. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist so you can buy it and sell it for more fiat later. It is a REPLACEMENT for fiat. You buy and NEVER sell. You spend once it achieves its true value. You don\u2019t need an exit strategy. You just save in Bitcoin. With alts, you need to time your exit and sell to a greater fool, because alts are scams, holding forever will get you rekt. Just DCA Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s like picking up gold off the ground before anyone else realises it will become money. Don\u2019t pick up pebbles or seashells (alts), your pockets have limited space. Finally, the most important problem to solve is separating money and state. All other problems are tiny in comparison. We don\u2019t need to replace the legal system with smart contracts. We don\u2019t need a token for everything. We don\u2019t need to put bananas on a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is an invention that solves a humanitarian problem. Altcoins take a solution (blockchain) and try to find a problem. Remember that.",

Proof of work is important because \n\n1) They do not legally fit the Howey test as a security. This is not merely an opinion but tested case law in the USA. \n\n2) A similar amount of effort in securing the coin must be invested to be rewarded the coin creating long term incentives in the project and making it very costly to attack it. Miners who have sunk infrastructure costs on mining a particular algo, especially with ASICs\n\n3)  Fair Coin Distribution.  No scammy ICO , premine or instamine is created and miners are forced to sell most of their coins to cover the expense (mainly ASICs + electricity) which allows a fair distribution and competition in the minting process.\n\n4) Since mining BTC is so competitive, profit margins are typically thin and thus new entrants that either use a better tool to mine (ASIC) or find cheaper sources of power(typically green due to the economics) can quickly gain market share making lasting monopolies difficult. Even if a main ASIC manufacturer appears to have a large market share we can see this quickly change due to a single malinvestment or a mistake when developing the newest ASIC. Power is a resource that comes from many sources and allows many locations around the world to remain competitive for unique reasons. \n\n5)\tObjective Security- Proof of work gives us an objective and measurable degree of security where risk assessments can be made with greater precision that isn't afforded with more subjective forms of security.\n\n6)\tThere is no company that controls a pure PoW coin in many cases thus the project will win or fail on its own merit and doesn't have a long burn rate created by speculators\n\n7)\tProof of stake game theory insures that those with the most coins will continue to collect the most fees , thus creating a vicious cycle of centralization where they continue to accrue more coins with 0 effort unlike with Proof of work where a meritocracy exists of those trying to be more efficient and miners are forced to sell most of their coins\n\n>why u r trying to push it on me?!! \n\nPlease do not buy any Bitcoin or cryptocurrency until you learn more.

Marketing and advertisements work. That's why tech giants like Google and Facebook are as big as they are. Having a good product/service and gaining customers solely through word-of-mouth might work for relatively small businesses in some sectors, but simply stating that any good product will sell itself without advertisements isn't really reflective of the modern world.\n\n> amount of crypto investment requested I receive is just unbelievable mostly in social media. my reply to them always is if it is good business why u r trying to push it on me?!! get all profits ? why u need me? \n\nPretty much all of these advertisements fall into one of two categories:\n\n1. They're for an alt-coin, ICO, token or some other not-quite-Bitcoin cryptocurrency. They're essentially saying \"you know about Bitcoin? Check out our similar thing that no one has heard of.\"\n\n2. They're for a service that offers Bitcoin-related trading. What such ads are saying is \"You want Bitcoin? Use our service to get it.\"\n\nIn both cases, the advertisement is not about Bitcoin. It more or less assumes that the viewer already knows about Bitcoin and it uses that to direct your attention to whatever product or service they're trying to sell.\n\nBitcoin itself doesn't advertise, because there's no business behind Bitcoin. There are businesses that offer products/services that use or involve Bitcoin, but their purpose is to promote their own products/services, not Bitcoin. If Bitcoin becomes more popular, it will likely benefit their business, but Bitcoin is big enough that no Bitcoin-related business can get a good return on investment in promoting Bitcoin in general as opposed to their own product/service. And many altcoins/tokens/ICOs are the product of a centralized business that seeks to benefit from propping up that specific altcoin/token/ICO. \n\nFinally, I agree that the trading/investing aspects aren't all that interesting compared to the technical side. For that, you can simply start by reading the Bitcoin whitepaper, which is the document that started it all. Most of it isn't too technical for the average reader. Beyond that, there are highly praised books on the technical / practical aspects of Bitcoin, such as Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos. But since most people who are interested in those parts of Bitcoin tend to gravitate away from books and more towards online resources, you may be right that in the realm of Bitcoin books, the trading-focused books, which target a different audience, start to outnumber the technical books.",

To be backed by, means that $1 = 1 unit of gold, but as we inflate the supply (quantative easing, loans with fractional reserve, furlough etc), we change the ratio of fiat to units of gold and therefore the backing is broken.\n\nThat's from a mathematic point of view, but from a historical point of view, you should know that during WW1 most countries borrowed from the US and abandoned their tether to valuable metals and then in 1971 the USA \"temporarily\" cut their tether and the world was completely off the gold standard.\n\nIn fact, fiat isn't backed, it is mandated. It is mandated by a powerful entity that has the backing of law enforcement, courts and many other formal tools to keep that mandate effective.\n\n2. What is bitcoin backed by is actually the wrong question and it's designed to mislead.\n\nWhat is gold backed by? Gold is valuable in itself because of its properties: it is difficult to destroy, and it is rare/scarce.\n\nIt has other properties that we give it such as useful for jewellery, electronics, and useful for monetisation (store of value amidst the inflation of all of our fiats).\n\nBitcoin has some properties: it is \"eventually\" immutable (eventually because it takes a few blocks before you can consider it immutable), it is highly divisible, it is weightless (move massive units across the world in seconds), and it is indifferent to politics despite its functionality being based on human consensus.\n\nBitcoin is not easy to compare, it is something very new. That indifference makes it great for being a-political (uncensorable) to the point where it can't be used in any way to impose sanctions, it is anti-fragile in that if a subset of people choose to force Bitcoin to behave differently, bitcoin doesn't change, it splits into 2 different networks and the free market chooses which one is more valuable based on people's free will to use one over the other. This happened in 2017 for the blocksize wars and is an amazing thing to read about.\n\nSo bitcoin has properties that people can get behind and it is scarce, more so than gold. This makes it perfect for monetisation and that is what is happening. The thing about monetising bitcoin is that it can be a store of value but the technology is so frictionless that there is no reason to then start using it as a medium of exchange.\n\nIt is already being used to help people do commerce cross borders where using traditional currency requires old slow and expensive service providers, this is something that we've never had... Send money across the internet without a slow chain of middlemen that need to protect themselves from each other so they use credit agreements and batch payments etc.\n\nIf you're getting your advice from \"crypto\" experts, you're probably getting a lot of misinformation. Bitcoin wasn't the first attempt at a digital impartial money, but it is the first that is still working. It takes a while to really internalise and understand its consensus algorithm, but consensus means something we all agree on. By having some other coin with another consensus algorithm, we have non-consensus. These people should be working on finding ways to increase Bitcoin's consensus, not trying to fracture it.\n\nBitcoiners focus on consensus and decentralisation so much because it is literally the thing that Satoshi introduced new into the mix of other existing technologies to make bitcoin and he did it for a specific reason: all previous attempts were taken over or shut down.\n\nDon't trade bitcoin, use it to preserve your wealth using something scarce, hard to destroy or manipulate, and something that is actually finding its purpose and drawing in market share.",

The whole \"intrinsic value\" marketing slogan is a myth.\n\nPMs and Gold are very useful elements. Bitcoin is a very useful currency. \"intrinsic value\" is a misleading term that many gold bugs like to use that seems to either suggest there is some \"inherent value\" in something physical or that gold has alternative usecases other than as money it can fall back on.\n\nGold is a useful element and Bitcoin is a useful technology. Both derive their value subjectively from humans. Just because something is physical in nature doesn't mean that it has value to humans. Many physical things have negative value like trash that people pay others to take from them. Even very useful resources can sometimes have negative value like we saw with crude oil futures temporarily.\n\nhttps://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value\n\nAs for alternative use cases , Bitcoin has many as its a timestamping protocol, currency, store of value asset, payment rail, smart contract platform, decentralized messaging system. It can fail on 1 or multiple of these and still be a tremendous success.\n\n>(which is by itself not eco friendly but ignore that)\n\nThis notion comes  from a flawed understanding of economics. Fiat currency and PoS coins cost at least the same amount of resources to  create , regulate and secure as Bitcoin.\n\nThere is an inescapable reality for any asset or currency that as it increases in value the production costs and costs to secure increase as well . This is demonstrated in the economic axiom: MC=MR\n\n\u201cRent\u201d always forces production costs (MC) to always equal sale prices (MR)\n\nPoS currencies and fiat are simply more abstract and complex forms or Proof of Work that use more human involvement (which uses tremendous amounts of resources and has a tremendous environmental impact) as a PoW coin like Bitcoin. Humans instead of ASICs are shouldering more of the work to create, regulate , and secure each of those currencies; This is \"work\" whether it involves burning electricity directly or food and electricity that humans consume  to perform their work. This is an inescapable economic reality. The more valuable something is the more it will cost to secure it because the more effort will be made to steal and or control it. This applies to any currency or asset.\n\nThis is also better understood with the dollar auction dilemma. In a hypothetical auction where a bidding war is fighting over the right to mint a 1 dollar bill how much do you think people will be willing to spend for this power ?\n\n>but how really stable is the crypto? \n\n99% of the cryptocurrency ecosystem is filled with scams or pointless pump and dumps and is not stable at all. The true innovation in this category is \"Proof of Work\" and what makes a blockchain secure and decentralized.",

The intelligentsia of the market is the combined knowledge of all humans and algorithms which is more than knowledge than anyone can have. Also bitcoin is so scarce that a single wealthy investor can significantly move the market in secret and unannounced.\nRather than trying to time the market , let time work for you.\n\n**Time in the market will tend to beat timing the market**\n\nEvery persons investment strategy is highly dependent upon their personal lives so what works for one person doesn't work for others. \n\nHere are some examples :\n\n1) If you were to ask what my investment strategy than here you go-  https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/s93wzd/what_currently_are_the_most_universally_accepted/htlbesp/\n\n2) another strategy to focus on maximum gains is to lump sum invest because - https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/seyzwq/dca_or_buy_during_a_dip/humjx7m/\n\n3) Another strategy if you don't want to lump sum and want to reduce volatility is - Thus if you get paid twice a month than what you should do is buy some Bitcoin immediately twice a month and also in addition set buy limit orders on an exchange for 5-10% below spot price. If those orders do not get filled by  the following paycheck than buy your set amount and reset the buy limit orders for 5-10% below spot price from the current market price.\nThe reason for this is 2 fold:\n\na)\tyou can auto pickup savings with BTC volatility on the dips which is psychologically rewarding\n\nb)\tIf a large amount of people create large amounts of Buy limit support than BTC becomes more stable unit of account and more liquid leading to more investor confidence and making BTC more of a currency(less volatility = better unit of account) and thus increases the likelihood your investment will continue appreciating in value.\n\n\nThe reason having a fiat savings account is so important is it not only will it save you if you lose a job or have an unexpected car expense or medical bill, but that it makes you a more rational investor that is less stressed out by the volatility in your more risky investments like Bitcoin. Bitcoin historically has had at least 2 bear markets lasting a little over 1 year thus you need to be prepared to not be forced to sell at a loss for at least 2 years to give yourself enough of a buffer.",

It should be noted that less bitcoin is lost these days and less will be lost in the future as the value goes up.\n\nThis is not the same as gold because with gold the larger the price increases the more incentive there exists to mine and find gold and with gold large amounts can be found like with asteroid mining.\n\nIn 2026 Psyche will start reporting back to NASA the expected reality that there will a sudden hyper-inflationary spike in the volume of gold being mined in the near future\nhttps://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/psyche/\nSince psyche 16 asteroid represents an example of an asteroid that is a core of an early planet thus metallic and estimated to contain around $700 quintillion dollars of precious metals (gold, platinum, etc..) or 93 billion dollars of precious metals per person.\nWhile mining will not start immediately, the markets will start pricing in the expectation of mining and nation states will start to slowly sell their gold reserves if they are wise enough flooding the market with cheap gold.\n\nNation states will need an alternative asset to hedge against.\n\n-----------------------\n\n>I guess my question is, how is this better than the current monetary system, and how can it act as a universal currency when its supply cannot be replenished? \n\nThe supply does not need to be replenished ever because Bitcoin is so divisible, (13 decimal places in a payment channel) the total amount doesn't matter because even if Bitcoin is worth 100 million a coin you can still have enough divisibility to buy a cup of coffee. \n\n**There is plenty of parts to go around** \n\nDivisibility is not the same thing as increased inflation either as 1 usd = 4 quarters = 10 dimes = 100 pennies with purchasing power and inflation only occurs when another dollar is printed to drive down the spending power of each dollar.\n\nIf your concerns are with slight economic deflation vs inflation\n\nI personally prefer slight deflation for these reasons :\n\n1)\tEncourages people to invest in things they really need instead of unnecessary fluff and short term desires which is good for society and the environment\n\n2)\tencourages more savings instead of debt slavery which removes choice, confidence and power away from individuals\n\n\n3)\tkeeps fiat currency in check where too much inflation will cause more capital flight to Bitcoin and prevents corrupt governments from abusing the backdoor tax of inflation\n\n4) Reduces the negative cantillon effect of fiat by removing some of the control over currency from a small group of people that is in part due to fiat being inflationary\nhttps://fee.org/articles/the-cantillon-effect-because-of-inflation-we-re-financing-the-financiers/\n\n>what factors are actually propping the value of Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is very valuable and useful money. \n\n1) **Save money** -  I like to save money with various services like lolli.com, ln.pizza ,foldapp.com,purse.io, or bitrefill.com (Bitcoin achieves this by credit and gift card arbitrage opportunities thus creating an efficiency)\n\n2) **Digital Gold** - Bitcoin is very desirable and scarce and since it is an uncorrelated asset class your portfolio is better hedged to be a safer way of finding alpha\n\n3) **Timestamping** - Tweetstamp, and opentimestamps are useful timestamping tools \n\n4) **Insurance** - If my bank account or credit cards get lost or stolen or account is frozen Bitcoin is a great alternative to store value\n\n5) **Censorship Resistance**- I can make donations to organizations like defense distributed or wikileaks even if their payment processors and banks are shutoff due to unethical political pressure\n\n6) **Sovereignty** - As a Business I can accept value even if I am deplatformed or banned from banking \n\n7) **Micro transactions** microtxs are simply not possible with fiat , where I  can do so with my BTC lightning wallet\n\n8) **Security** SSS and multisig with CLTV and other scripts allow for novel methods to secure ones wealth\n\n9) **Privacy** with electronic fiat I have no privacy unlike with Bitcoin transactions where I am given a choice between privacy or transparency with each wallet\n\n10)\t**Global** I can travel the world , rent hotels and buy plane tickets and withdraw local currency easily without fears of credit card fraud. I can send payments to employees in foreign countries easily\n\n11) **Interesting and fun** It is fascinating mixture of technology, game theory, security, mathematics, politics, and economics that never bores me",

Personally I also do not like inflation and the hypercapitalist military industrial complex it funds, but I don't think that a deflationary system is necessarily good either. It means that people will be extremely shrewd with savings and perhaps even try to coast through life on the gains made from saving Bitcoin, not unlike how rich people currently rest on their laurels with their stock portfolios. I would prefer instead for the purchasing power of a dollar to remain the exact same today as it is 10 years in the future. \n\nAnd the whole hedge as inflation thing is very dependent on how much bitcoin is adopted. It has currently two things working against it, in my view. One is the overly aggressive saving culture it encourages (the only difference between a Bitcoin society and our current one is that instead of stocks, the rich will hoard value in coins), the other is the many (powerful) governments working against it because Bitcoin is a threat to fiat. \n\nA lot of the pros that you list of Bitcoin are certainly good things, but I can see them being abused as well. Harder to trace + private transactions are useful tools for hit men, drug dealers, and distributers of child pornography. Allowing deplatformed individuals to continue their business could mean allowing extremists to operate without consequence. And, it could also work against even regular people. If your wallet is hacked you're shit out of luck. If you lose money from your credit card, banks can at least make a decent effort to recover lost funds. \n\nI guess in the end it all depends on whether you trust individuals more or the government more, and that's going to be informed largely by what country you live in.",

IMHO i don't think it matters much as long as enough liquidity exists that the currency is stable which is not the case for bitcoin at the moment but what we hope will eventually occur with more liquidity in due time. \n\n>It means that people will be extremely shrewd with savings \n\nThis is what is suggested would happen with scary terms such as \"deflationary death spiral\" but thus far Bitcoin has proven this incorrect. During period of high deflation(appreciation) tx velocity tends to increase and merchant processors actually see an increase in spending for goods and services and charitable giving in Bitcoin.\n\nThis is believed to be caused by the feeling of newfound wealth(because they are wealthier) eventually overrides their desire to \"hoard\" (when did savings become a negative thing?) their Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is already testing some economic theories and proving them somewhat inaccurate but the data gathering is far from over and we all have a lot to learn .\n\n>I would prefer instead for the purchasing power of a dollar to remain the exact same today as it is 10 years in the future.\n\none research paper suggested this as a target but in reality it can only be a target because no government yet has been able to achieve this \n\n>whole hedge as inflation thing is very dependent on how much bitcoin is adopted.\n\nBitcoin being disinflationary means it will be a hedge against inflation even with 0 new adoption. New adoption simply means bitcoin appreciates much more rapidly against fiat. \n\n>One is the overly aggressive saving culture it encourages\n\nThis is a false impression that doesn't match with reality. Every bull market thus far where rapid deflation occurs more spending and giving occurs. \n\n>Harder to trace + private transactions are useful tools for hit men, drug dealers, and distributers of child pornography.\n\nThe US dollar dominates these areas and these are things that will never disappear. bitcoin at least doesn't as easily help governments commit war crimes, genocide and democide like fiat does. Imagine if putin had to pay for his war with bitcoin.\n\n>deplatformed individuals to continue their business could mean allowing extremists to operate without consequence.\n\nIf someone commits a crime they should be prosecuted. monetary freedom is akin to freedom of expression and it is very dangerous allowing a small group of corrupt individuals to restrict how people express their values. \n\n>If your wallet is hacked you're shit out of luck.\n\nBitcoin being a bearer asset is more akin to cash or gold in its security assumptions but much more secure because losing your wallet doesn't mean you lost your bitcoin. Digital fiat can be vulnerable in many ways with many kinds of theft that bitcoin is not vulnerable to as well. There are nuances between the two , but you don't need to choose one or the other and can use both \n\n>If you lose money from your credit card, banks can at least make a decent effort to recover lost funds.\n\nYou are also much more prone to a merchant double charging you , or continuing a subscription charge without your wishes , or identity theft , or asset forfeiture or civil forfeiture with cards and banks. There are nuanced differences between the two\n\n>depends on whether you trust individuals more or the government more,\n\nIts not an either or choice. This is a false dichotomy. Use bitcoin as a tool. Bonds and Tbills are no longer wise investments because they can't beat inflation so you lost one uncoorelated asset class in your portfolio and need to replace it with bitcoin to be hedged and diversified. Bitcoin is very useful money as well that you can use worldwide. What happens if you card is frozen , stolen, or lost travelling? With bitcoin you are fine.",

Like you said, these things will never go away.

We already have seen this in a few examples where governments try and stop bitcoin by making bitcoin illegal and all it does is drive up a premium for that bitcoin.\n\n>but how is it that if you lose your wallet you don't lose your Bitcoin?\n\nMany people have a cell wallet with petty amounts of bitcoin and a hardware wallet for their main savings. If either your cell phone or hardware wallet gets stolen , lost or damaged you don't lose anything and the thieves cannot steal your bitcoin. Thieves cannot steal your bitcoin because you have a pin or passphrase even if the theif finds your fingerprint or cell pin and you don't lose your bitcoin because your backup words written on metal or paper recover your bitcoin . Here is the interesting thing as well. 12 words is enough to recover all your bitcoin and is a one time future proof backup that will recover any future btc you have as well without re-making a backup. \n\nAt the most basic level you thus need to focus on keeping your bitcoin backup words private and secure like gold . But unlike with gold you can use a passphrase or multisig where even if someone finds your words they can't steal your bitcoin . thus bitcoin can start to become much more secure than cash or gold.",

                    "response": "Lets discuss some of the properties of what makes a good currency and where Bitcoin fits now compared to gold and fiat\n\n\n**1) Durability** = Gold is best here due to its history and physical nature. Bitcoin and fiat  being digital in nature means we must compare the  durability of the institution/network that issues and secures them. I would suggest that Bitcoin will slightly excel responsible nation states here and does far better than  unreliable forms of fiat when looking at the history of fiat compared the the history and properties of Bitcoin(2017 gave a lot of credibility to Bitcoin in it thwarting a powerful attack and nation states have repeatedly attacked Bitcoin to one degree or another)\n\n**2) Portability** = Gold is horrible in this category being physical, heavy and unable to be sent digitally(custodians don't count as you lose most the benefits of gold and it switched categories from a bearer asset to registered value). Bitcoin beats fiat here too as its peer to peer , global and lacks regulatory friction. \n\n**3) Fungibility** Gold and bitcoin tie here. When comparing fiat to Bitcoin it is more complicated but Bitcoin beats fiat here overall and is significantly getting better each year. Physical fiat has some advantages over Bitcoin in the sense that its easier to have strong privacy locally as long as the whole \"anonymity set\" (group of users) avoid depositing the fiat in ATMs and banks(physical cash has serial numbers that are tracked with OCR + bill readers everywhere). Bitcoin can be very private if you use the right wallet and you take precautions but if you make a mistake onchain you can also have problems. Bitcoin being used with a lightning wallet is extremely private by default and chain analysis is useless. Digital fiat isn't very fungible or private at all. Gold isn't as fungible as many people suggest either due to different grading, certifying prices, forms which all fetch different prices.\n\n**4) Scarcity** -- Bitcoin wins this hands down with a fixed and limited supply. ~2-4 million BTc have been permanently lost/destroyed and many people also a long term investors leading to more scarcity. Gold is a distant 2nd with concerns in asteroid mining - (Psyche 16 as an example) and not knowing if any other large deposit can be found but far superior to fiat. \n\n**5) Divisibility** Bitcoin is already divisible by 8 decimal places onchain and 1/1000 of a satoshi on other layers like lightning. Thus micro txs are possible with bitcoin and too impractical with gold and not as easily done with fiat due to regulatory friction  and costs. The idea is that machines and software can tip other software, machines, and services by the minute or second to allow for more granularity and thus more efficiency with lower prices.\n\n**6) Acceptability** - Fiat wins this category for the time being due to its acceptance worldwide , especially US dollars. Bitcoin being a global currency without regulatory friction can one day overtake even the most accepted fiat however. Almost no one accepts gold for payment so its last and this is unlikely to change. \n\n**7) Verifiability** - Bitcoin wins here slightly over gold and fiat. Gold can be verified but takes more effort and there are concerns with tungsten filled bars and fake gold. Bitcoin being swept from a private key(coin or paper) or accepting an open dime is better than fiat physical cash, and digital fiat has very large concerns and delays in verification (chargebacks, fraud, etc...)\n\n**8) stability as a unit of account** - While Bitcoin is better than certain forms of fiat in this category, most are more stable than bitcoin and so Bitcoin remains 3rd compared to fiat and gold. We hope that Bitcoin in time will become less volatile with a much larger market cap . This trend is already occurring ,and much economic theory supports this happening but its still an experiment as to how long it will take and what size market cap / liquidity is needed\n\nSo you can see bitcoin is already better than fiat in 6 of the 8 categories above and the 2 remaining categories just take time.",

This doesn't increase the supply or diminish BTC's value. As more BTC is lost forever it drives up the value of the remaining BTC, increased scarcity. \n\n  \n**Supply Distribution:**\n\nBitcoin's supply is highly distributed today across addresses and entities. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it, buying it, working for it or attracting investment through entrepreneurship. Today there is a strong incentive to hold Bitcoin and not spend it because its value is still rising rapidly. In the future the rate at which it increases in value will level off. As it levels off the incentive to hold reduces and incentive to spend increases.    \n\n\nBecause Bitcoin is designed to increase in value forever it will fundamentally change human incentive in many dimensions. Using Bitcoin to improve your quality of life will happen. That means spending it on homes, comforts, investments, etc. We will see a rapid decline in frivolous spending. Sats are too valuable to not be spent on things that REALLY matter, that REALLY provide an improvement to our lives.   \n\n\n**FIAT Collapse & Bitcoin's Rise:**   \nBitcoin is valuable because the supply is capped and fixed at 21m. This protects and increases its purchasing power over time. \n\n  \nBitcoin is valuable because it's decentralized and distributed globally protecting it from being controlled, manipulated and destroyed.   \n\n\nBitcoin is valuable because it is immutable and permissionless. This protects every humans freedom, time, effort and ability to participate in the economy based on their contributions. No one can lock you out or hold you down. Think meritocracy.   \n\n\nThe problems with society stemming from fiat and the collapse of fiat causing a semi temporary collapse in society is not what gives Bitcoin value. Bitcoin's attributes and properties exist with or without fiat and with or without all the problems fiat causes.   \n\n\n  \nGreat questions and thoughts, thank you for sharing. It gave me an opportunity to think about how to answer and share it.   \n\n\nBravo...keep digging! #ClearMined",

If you buy a chair for 50 dollars and one year goes by, the chair is secondhand and has a value of 20 dollars. You can sell the chair, but you will lose money since you paid more. If for any reason the chair becomes a vintage collection item, people will value it at 200 dollars and pay you way more than the price you paid. Then if you sell it you will earn money.\n\nWith Bitcoin it happens the same, you can hold your Bitcoin and sell it when it's higher. Of course, learn about the market and don't spend money you need now. If you do it you will feel forced to sell at a loss.\n\nAlso, don't use leverage do buy money.

The amount isn't the issue, it's about how long you hold it and what you used it for / the intent of holding it. If you intended to get crypto to make a profit, it's a CGT event.  \nThe rate that you'll be taxed is 30%, unless you hold it for >12 months, in which case it's 15% due to the CGT discount. (That means you hold the exact crypto for that long. You can't swap between different crypto, it refers to that specific individual holding).   \nThe only non-CGT events for crypto are for personal use - eg. you have the crypto specifically to use as a currency, and don't intend to make a financial gain. Your example doesn't follow that.\n2. Assuming AUD stays constant, you'd have $120, of which $20 is taxable on disposal, at 30% this will result in $6 tax. If AUD changes, you need to account for that.\n\nSource: https://www.ato.gov.au/general/gen/tax-treatment-of-crypto-currencies-in-australia---specifically-bitcoin/",

                    "response": "> Is a wallet app only accessible on one device at a time or can you log in and out from multiple places at any time?\n\nThat depends on the type of wallet application.\n\nThe critical piece of data are the \"private keys\" that allow you to spend your funds. Most modern wallets store these in the form of something akin to a \"master private key\", which is called the \"seed\". In principle, you can use this seed on as many devices as you'd like and have each device be able to fully control your funds, but the more devices that store this seed, the greater the risk of someone else gaining access to it.\n\nInstead, some wallet implementations allow you to create \"watch-only\" wallets, that let you monitor your funds, but not control them. So you could have your seed stored securely on one device (such as a hardware wallet), but with a watch-only version on several other devices, letting you check your funds all the time, while keeping the seed as secure as possible.\n\nFinally, there are custodial wallets. These wallets place the keys in the hands of someone else, the company running the service. You can log in through a webpage from anywhere and both monitor and manage your funds. The main downside of custodial wallets is that you're at the mercy of the wallet operator. If they decide to not like you anymore or to go out of business completely, you lose access to your funds. So while convenient to use, custodial wallets are not recommended for anything beyond small amounts of spending money.\n\n> If you have a hardware wallet does it need to be \"online\" to receive coins at the time of the transaction?\n\nNo. The coins aren't sent to the hardware wallet. The device only holds the keys to access the coins.\n\n> If you buy coins from say a coinbase exchange, and receive coins from other sources, what is the best way to see your current totals and value, and keep track of the transactions?\n\nMost wallet applications will show you an overview of transactions and account balances. If you just want to see what you've received and sent and when, as well as your current balance, then pretty much all wallets will do that for you as that is quite basic functionality.",

What matters is the fact that there is a limit, there is scarcity that is open , predictable , and agreed upon beforehand and not manipulated by corrupt Central planners like fiat or some altcoins (even popular ones) do.\n\nSince Bitcoin is extremely divisible (13 decimal places in a payment channel) the total amount doesn't matter because even if Bitcoin is worth 100 million a coin you can still have enough divisibility to buy a cup of coffee. \n\n**There is plenty of parts to go around** \n\nDivisibility is not the same thing as increased inflation either as 1 usd = 4 quarters = 10 dimes = 100 pennies with purchasing power and inflation only occurs when another dollar is printed to drive down the spending power of each dollar\n\nWhen any of the above happens it does not harm Bitcoin network at all, and simply acts as a charitable donation to all Bitcoin users making Bitcoin more scarce\n\n\nAlmost all of the 2-4 million lost Bitcoin happened during the first 2 years because bitcoin had little to no value. Very little bitcoin are lost these days and as Bitcoin grows in value and becomes much more distributed it will even be rarer to see lost bitcoin",

Full nodes(most not in control of miners) enforce the rules and validate transactions and blocks. \n\n>How does he generates bitcoin ? \n\nThere is a controlled Fixed disinflationary supply in bitcoin where currently every ~10 minutes one miner or miner pool gets awarded 6.25 BTC \n\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply\n\nThe protocol awards the miner if they conform the rules and find a block \n\n>What does the cpu or gpu contribute towards mining ?\n\nCPU mining became obsolete in 2011 and GPU mining became obsolete in 2013. You need an ASIC to mine bitcoin these days \n\n> In it's early stanges how satoshi mined a block if he was the one who made the transaction ?\n\nThe genesis block was hardcoded in the protocol and unspendable. Early blocks mined by satoshi and many others didn't have many transactions if any. You can collect the \"coinbase\" (inflation) reward without including any transactions in a block \n\n>What is being referred when the term transaction is mentioned ?\n\nIn what context?\n\n>where i saw about mining is that a seller makes a call and buyer is there to buy and inorder to secure the transaction\n\nYou seem to be conflating offchain orders made on centralized exchanges and mining which is incorrect. The bitcoin protocol doesn't need any human or company to reward the miners.\n\n>Moreover how is block made ???\n\nMiners use bitcoin full node code (often indirectly via the pool ) with block templates to create a block and broadcast it to all other full nodes. The software/protocol itself allows them to do this",

This is not merely an opinion but tested case law in the USA with the trendon shavers case. \n\n2) A similar amount of effort in securing the coin must be invested to be rewarded the coin creating long term incentives in the project and making it very costly to attack it. Miners who have sunk infrastructure costs on mining a particular algo, especially with ASICs\n\n3)  Fair Coin Distribution.  No scammy ICO , premine or instamine is created and miners are forced to sell most of their coins to cover the expense (mainly ASICs + electricity) which allows a fair distribution and competition in the minting process.\n\n4) Since mining BTC is so competitive, profit margins are typically thin and thus new entrants that either use a better tool to mine (ASIC) or find cheaper sources of power(typically green due to the economics) can quickly gain market share making lasting monopolies difficult. Even if a main ASIC manufacturer appears to have a large market share we can see this quickly change due to a single malinvestment or a mistake when developing the newest ASIC. Power is a resource that comes from many sources and allows many locations around the world to remain competitive for unique reasons. \n\n5) Objective Security- Proof of work gives us an objective and measurable degree of security where risk assessments can be made with greater precision that isn't afforded with more subjective forms of security.\n\n5)\tThere is no company that controls a pure PoW coin in many cases thus the project will win or fail on its own merit and doesn't have a long burn rate created by speculators\n\n6)\tOther means of consensus always devolve into centralization and corrupted like Proof of stake where those with the most money or rewarded themselves with the most premine automatically collects the most fees or miner rewards for no additional effort and thus a vicious cycle occurs where they become more and more powerful unlike with Bitcoin.",

This means that for the first time in history, humans have access to a digital form of money that isn\u2019t controlled by a central party.\n\nBitcoin gave us back the amazing powers of independence and financial freedom.\n\n**Great power always comes with great responsibility.**\n\nBitcoin\u2019s transactional finality makes the custodial model obsoleteThe launch of Bitcoin has coincided with new business opportunities and models. The most needed one was providing secure and reliable fiat on and off ramps, also more commonly known as Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nIn order to be tradeable, liquid and easily convertible into fiat currencies, Bitcoin needed online marketplaces. The wishes of bitcoin sellers and buyers are gathered together into a common ledger called an order book. This interaction between buyers and sellers creates the fiat denominated price dynamics of Bitcoin. \n\nThese kinds of Bitcoin exchanges can also be called Custodial Exchanges, which means that the exchange will hold the financial funds (both fiat and bitcoins) of their clients.\n\nThere are some blatant issues and vulnerabilities with that business model.\n\nThe custodial model reproduces the old financial model of banks where all of the clients\u2019 money is held and controlled by a singular entity. Often these funds are held as promises with very little to back them. Many bitcoin exchanges run fraudulent fractional reserves. The problem is that you never know for sure until it\u2019s too late. In 2013, the world\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, we discovered to not hold all of the bitcoin it was supposed to be holding for its clients. And in 2019, Canada\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange, Quadriga, was discovered to be running a similar scheme defrauding many hard working Canadians who trusted them with their savings.\n\nAnd this phenomenon is not unique to bitcoin. History is filled with legacy financial institutions who run fractional reserves. Satoshi said it best himself:\n\n\u201cThe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that\u2019s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.\u201d\n\nTalk is Cheap, Building is Hard\n\nAll modern exchanges will repeat the mantra \u201cNot your keys, not your coins\u201d.\n\nThat famous expression means that if you don\u2019t hold the private keys associated with your Bitcoin wallet, you don\u2019t really own your Bitcoin.\n\nWe take our words seriously.\n\nThat\u2019s why since day one, Bull Bitcoin decided to adopt a non-custodial model to force its users to self-custody by default. This is the real disruption that bitcoin offers the world \u2014 true financial disintermediation and the enabling of a strictly peer to peer money.\n\nIf you\u2019re still holding your coins on an exchange, you should definitely read the rest of this article\u2026\n\n**Seven Reasons Why You Should Self-custody Your Bitcoin**\n\n**1. Custodial exchanges are big honey-pots and they\u2019re constantly targeted by hackers**\n\nIf you\u2019ve been in Bitcoin long enough, you probably heard about important hacks where billions worth of Bitcoins have been stolen.\n\nThe most famous hack happened in 2014, when close to 850,000 bitcoins were supposedly hacked on a Japanese exchange called Mt. Gox.\n\nThese 850,000 bitcoins are worth close to $50 billion USD at the time of writing. Just recently, the plan to compensate Mt. Gox creditors has finally been settled, 7 years after the infamous event. However, only $9 billion will be distributed amongst the creditors.Canada\u2019s Bitcoin Horror Story\n\nCanadians have also had their own exchange horror story. QuadriguaCX was one of the most popular and used Canadian custodial exchanges before its founder and CEO Gerald Cotten suddenly died in India in December 2018.The circumstances of his death are still questioned today. The main issue was that he brought all the necessary access data and private keys of the exchange with him to his grave. \n\nAs a consequence, more than $250 million worth of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are still inaccessible today. It was also discovered that they had been running a fraudulent fractional reserve and didn\u2019t have nearly the amount of client bitcoin deposits they claimed to. Over 100,000 Canadians were affected, and many lost their life savings.\n\nThe story is so strange and interesting that Netflix will soon launch a documentary about it.\n\nIt Happened, and it Will Happen Again\n\nBig hacks are less common today, but you should never put your guard down. It\u2019s only a question of time before the next big hack strikes an exchange. Simply hoping you won\u2019t be a victim is reckless and dangerous.\n\nWithdraw your coins into your own wallet now because it might be too late tomorrow.\n\n**2. Your Own Self-custody Solution is Way More Secure**\n\nSome exchanges have ambiguous security measures to protect the funds of their clients. Some of them won\u2019t even tell you how they\u2019re keeping your coins safe. If you\u2019re not a technical person, you cannot imagine how many possible methods exist to penetrate a custodial exchange to steal clients funds. But most importantly, an account with an exchange is much easier to hack than a private bitcoin wallet.\n\nCheck out the impressive table below to see how varied the attack methods were to hack exchanges since 2011. Some hackers are getting really creative to put their hands on some precious Bitcoin.\n\nVisit the link below to see different cyber security threats to Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nFrom Hodl to Heist: Analysis of Cyber Security Threats to Bitcoin Exchanges, a study done by Kris Oosthoek and Christian Doerr, [https://www.cyber-threat-intelligence.com/publications/ICBC-2020-bitcoinexchangehacks.pdf](https://www.cyber-threat-intelligence.com/publications/ICBC-2020-bitcoinexchangehacks.pdf)\n\nAs you can see, when you\u2019re entrusting an external party to custody your Bitcoin, you simply don\u2019t have any control over it. The expertise necessary to maintain a custodial exchange is extremely advanced and it\u2019s really difficult to evaluate if an exchange maintains high grade security standards. And that\u2019s if they have the bitcoin in the first place!\n\nSelf-custody risks are much more manageable and less costly to fix. There is certainly a learning curve, but the actual technical skillset to securely custody your Bitcoin (even for large quantities) is quite low. In fact, it\u2019s been our experience that the most difficult thing about bitcoin self-custody is gaining the confidence that you\u2019re able to do it. We promise, everyone can!\n\n**The rest of the article in the comments below**",

                            "response": "**3. Exchanges might not actually be holding onto your Bitcoin**\n\nThe numbers that your custodial exchange is displaying in your account is just a database entry, it\u2019s a number on your screen, it isn\u2019t proof of anything. Just like a traditional bank account isn\u2019t backed with actual dollar holdings by the bank, many bitcoin exchange accounts aren\u2019t backed by actual bitcoin holdings.\n\nWhen an exchange platform says that you have 5 bitcoins to your name, you don\u2019t really have 5 bitcoins to your name. The exchange is giving you a promise to hold 5 bitcoins for you, it\u2019s a form of an IOU. You own a bitcoin denominated liability held by a third party.\n\nAnd you don\u2019t really have any way to know if it will fulfill its promise until you actually attempt to withdraw the 5 bitcoins from your account to your own wallet.\n\nIn most modern, legitimate, custodial exchanges you will most likely receive your 5 bitcoins if you try to withdraw them from the platform. It is only at that moment that the exchange will respect and fulfill its liability to you. However, let\u2019s think this through a bit further:\n\nYou\u2019re probably not the only client of the exchange, which means that if all the customers of the platform wanted their bitcoins at the same time, the exchange better have full reserves of the coins, if not they will turn out to be insolvent.\n\nA custodial exchange is as good as any other bank, they run on fractional reserves\n\nThis is similar to a Run on a Bank phenomenon. All banks function on a fractional reserve system. That means that they actually hold only a fraction of the total funds they owe to their clients. If all of their clients decided to withdraw their money at the same time, the bank would not be able to pay everybody \u2014 it would simply collapse.\n\nA custodial exchange is basically like any other bank and it\u2019s not a secret that they\u2019re also likely to be running on a fractional reserve system. Once you have bitcoin sitting on a custodial exchange, it won\u2019t simply be sitting in a vault waiting for you.\n\nThey will often leverage that money and try to make a return on it. They will assume risk for your savings that you aren\u2019t being rewarded for except for the short-term convenience of not having to take responsibility.\n\nCan exchanges simply prove that they\u2019re really holding the client\u2019s deposits they are pretending to hold?\n\nMany have tried, but it turns out it is not that simple.\n\n**The Proof of Reserves Challenge**\n\nThe idea of exchanges proving that they really hold what they should hold has been proposed a long time ago in the Bitcoin industry. This idea made itself prevalent after years of deception and financial losses.\n\nHowever, even if this has been discussed for years now, a ridiculously small number of exchanges regularly conduct \u201cProof of Reserves\u201d audits.\n\nThere are actually many reasons why they wouldn\u2019t conduct this kind of audit:\n\n**Privacy and technical issues**\n\nProving your reserves without revealing information about your customers is rather challenging from a technical point of view. Numerous developers, notably Gregory Maxwell, have tried to propose a range of cryptographic verification tools. However, none are perfect and they also pose privacy issues.\n\n**Trust issues**\n\nIn most Proof of Reserves schemes, an external auditing party is employed as a source of truth and trust. That auditing party can be corrupted, misled or wrongful.\n\n**Costs issues**\n\nThese kinds of audits are rather costly since you need to employ vast internal and external resources to conduct them.\n\n**Strategic issues**\n\nAs an exchange, you don\u2019t want to reveal crucial information about your business and make it public, or entice attackers to take a deeper look at your operations.\n\nNic Carter, a Bitcoin researcher, partner at Castle Island Ventures and cofounder of the blockchain data aggregator Coinmetrics, has been exploring the subject of Proof of Reserves for years and has been an advocate to encourage exchanges to adopt it.\n\nYou can explore the subject further and read his research by going on his website here.\n\nYou might quickly realize however that despite his efforts a small number of exchanges actually adopted this kind of measure.\\*PoR stands for Proof of Reserves.\n\nFurther, It\u2019s extremely difficult to verify the liabilities of any financial institution. Ultimately you\u2019re always placing your trust in third party audit firms  and potentially corrupt regulators \u2014 remember, trusted third parties are security holes!\n\nWe\u2019re not saying you should be worried, but yeah, you should be worried.\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nIt\u2019s simple, have no reserves on an exchange.\n\nThe solution to the Proof of Reserves problem is having no reserves at all. Bull Bitcoin understood this early on and that\u2019s why we decided to adopt the non-custodial model from the beginning.\n\nLet\u2019s further explore the problem of exchange holding onto your coins.\n\n**Rest of the article in the comment below**",

You\u2019re Not Exposed to Confiscation**\n\nThe infamous \u201cExecutive order 6102\u201d is feared amongst Bitcoiner.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, the US President, Frankling D. Roosevelt, issued the order on the 5th of April 1933.American citizens were instructed to give out all the gold to the US government and the hoarding of gold coins, gold bullion and gold certificates was deemed illegal.\n\nIt\u2019s rather unknown how effective that governmental measure was to seize the gold of its citizens. However, a significant number of people got prosecuted, received heavy fines or went to jail because they wanted to circumvent the law.\n\nOne thing is clear, if you were holding your gold at home, it would have been way harder for the government to seize it!\n\nIt\u2019s a whole other story if you were holding your gold at the bank. At that time, banks were refusing gold withdrawal requests from their customers and were forcing them to convert it into dollars at the rate fixed by the government.\n\nThe parallel with today\u2019s Bitcoin situation is clear\n\nNothing stops your government from executing a similar type of order and making personal ownership of Bitcoin illegal.\n\nIf you\u2019re self-custodying your Bitcoin, chances are the government will have a hard time seizing it. It\u2019s way easier ordering custodial exchanges to force their customers to exchange Bitcoin or seizing them totally.\n\nIf done right, nobody will know (except the people you want to know) how you are self-custodying your coins (or even if you have any).Laws change all the time because they\u2019re written by humans. Your private keys will last forever because they\u2019re generated with mathematics.\n\n**5. You Can Only Preserve Your Privacy if You Self-custody**\n\nIf you custody your coins on an exchange, they will know everything about your holdings and may require you to constantly prove your identity so you can have access to your funds.\n\nOnce you have your bitcoins in your own wallet, intrusive surveillance will be a thing of the past. There are numerous free and open-source tools that you can use in order to obfuscate your bitcoin transactions.\n\nAlso, by self-custodying your coins you have plausible deniability regarding your coins. Nobody can be sure if you\u2019re still in possession of your coins from a blockchain analysis point of view.\n\nIt is also important to remain private with your bitcoins from a security point of view.\n\nIf you want to learn more about privacy implications, read the article we wrote about the subject [here](https://blog.bullbitcoin.com/blog/the-benefits-of-privacy).\n\n**6. Nobody Can Censor You If You Self-custody**\n\nThe true power of Bitcoin lies in the fact that nobody in the world can stop you from realizing a Bitcoin transaction whenever you want.\n\nThis is an incredible power in a world where financial censorship and surveillance is on the rise. When you\u2019re holding your coins in a custodial exchange, you need to ask permission to the exchange each time you want to do something with your funds.\n\nRemove these barriers from your money by self-custodying your Bitcoin in your own Bitcoin wallet. Be amazed each time you realize a transaction and understand that nobody in the world, no matter how powerful they are, could have stopped it.\n\n**7. Self-custodying Empowers You and Transforms You into a Sovereign Individual**\n\nSovereignty is described as supreme authority over a territory and is a political term that entails independence and autonomy of a state from other independent states.\n\nBitcoin brings a new meaning to this as it significantly lowers the requirements for an entity to be considered as sovereign.\n\nIn fact, it lowers it to the smallest entity possible: the individual.\n\nBitcoin gives the individual sovereignty that was previously reserved for larger political bodies.\n\nBy having a form of money that is out of the control of central banks, censorship and artificial debasement, you gain significant individual financial and monetary power.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to know that these characteristics are only valid if you self-custody your coins. Otherwise, custodial exchanges gain these powers over you.\n\nA lot of Bitcoiners will testify how holding their coins brings them a sense of sovereignty and empowerment. For the last generations, humans were conditioned to believe that it was normal and desired that the government hold the complete monopoly on the production and management of money.\n\nRemoving yourself from this system by self-custodying your wealth is truly a game changer. This additional responsibility often leads to additional reflections. Perhaps, once you gain complete control over your money and wealth, you will also like to take back power in other aspects of your life.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n(DISCLAIMER: WE TALK ABOUT OUR SOLUTION TO HELP YOU SELF-CUSTODY)\n\nIt\u2019s clear now how many advantages you gain by self-custodying your coins instead of leaving that responsibility to others.\n\nWe know that the switch can be rather difficult and stressful and that\u2019s why Bull Bitcoin constantly develops resources and services to help you transition from one to the other in a safe and empowering way.\n\nDon\u2019t hesitate any longer. Every second you\u2019re giving out the custody of your bitcoins to somebody else, you\u2019re risking never being able to self-custody them again.\n\nThere is a ton of free information and guides to help you learn how to properly install a wallet and self-custody your coins.\n\nHowever, we noticed there was a big void with regards to reliable and trusted services that help new Bitcoiners to approach self-custody the right way.\n\nThat\u2019s why we launched Bitcoin Support by Bull Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s a complete set of self-custody tools and detailed guides, but most importantly a whole team of dedicated security and custody experts that will help you install a wallet tailored to your needs, step by step.\n\nIt\u2019s the only service of its kind on the market. By developing this solution, we\u2019re doubling down on our mission to provide the best and safest way to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin worldwide.\n\nWe hope to gain your trust to direct your friends and family to properly onboard them into Bitcoin, starting today!\n\nCheck the website right now with the link below![https://www.bitcoinsupport.com/](https://www.bitcoinsupport.com/)",

If you read the article more you will see the article interchange fees as well that you are not adding to the base fees.\n\nThis is the chart from your cited article = \n\nVisa\t1.15% + $.05 to 2.4% + $.10\t.14% = **3.55% + 15 cents**\n\nMastercard\t1.15% + $.05 to 2.5% + $.10\t.1375% = **3.65% + 15 cents**\n\nDiscover\t1.35% + $.05 to 2.4% + $.10\t.13%= **3.75% + 15 cents**\n\nAmerican Express\t1.43% + $.10 to 3.3% + $.10= **4.73% + 20 cents**\n\n\n Some very misleading merchant processors will advertise extremely low fees but in the fine print you will see backend fees like the interchange fee which is required.  I have setup many merchant processors for myself and others in the USA and elsewhere. The exception to these fees would be for very large companies like Apple that can remove most of these fees and be left with the interchange fee alone because they can negotiate with extremely large volume and/or they essentially create a bank themselves within their parent company.\n\nIn my country it is also normal for merchants to pay 5-9% as well , which is why when you pay \"en efectivo\" merchants give you a discount of 3-5%",

They aren\u2019t a blockchain, aren\u2019t decentralized, and aren\u2019t what Bitcoin is supposed to be about. Decentralization also means that individuals are free to decide how to use their funds as they please and that doesn\u2019t mean it dictates how anyone else uses their Sats. CB is basically one user making a decision. The millions of other users don\u2019t have to follow their lead although they can *if they want* because they\u2019re free to do so. That doesn\u2019t impede anyone\u2019s ability to use BTC. \n\nBitcoin is not about day trading and definitely not about letting someone else \u201ccontrol\u201d your Sats which is what anyone who leaves their coins on an exchange is doing.

Bitcoin can fluctuate 1-5% daily in volatility on average but sometimes we see more like the ~10% jump like we say yesterday\n\nIf you spend and replace bitcoin like many of us do it solves 2 concerns : Not having regrets about missing out on any gains and not effected by volatility as you are merely using bitcoin as a payment rail to save money in stores like :\n\nhttp://ln.pizza  - save 6 % off dominoes Pizza in the USA with lightning wallet\n\nhttps://purse.io  Save 10-20% off amazon \n\nhttps://foldapp.com - save up to 20%  Starbucks, Uber, Target , whole foods , Dunkin \n\nhttps://www.lolli.com \u2013 save up to 30% by spending BTC anywhere but primarily USA stores\n\nhttps://stekking.com - save up to 20% by spending BTC anywhere but primarily Europe stores\n\n\n2) I suggest you watch at least two of the wallet videos in the pinned FAQ \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/g42ijd/faq_for_beginners/\n\nOne of the videos of a mobile wallet where you have a pin and backup seed word list and the other from a hardware wallet where you have a pin + hw wallet + sometimes passphrase. You should read about the importance in keeping your backup seed words private and secure\n\n>And you can have multiple wallets?\n\nAs many as you want \n\n3) Avoid that exchange as they are running a ponzi and might be fractional and have very high fees . Read the exchanges in the pinned FAQ .",

Because it is still new, and business decides how it's going to use it, and government talks about regulating it, it is going to continue to be a sort of roller coaster.  \n\n2.  The wallet has a key.  once you decide what other wallet you are going to make a payment to, it will ask for your key.  Which is a sort of password, so NEVER give it out.  If a person gets your address and your key, they can get access to your wallet.\n\n3.  It is usually pretty instant once you have USD/Euro in the exchange to go from that to bitcoin and back again.  Getting from your bank to the exchange depends on how you move the money.  ACH is slow.  Wire is fast.  Debit Card is in the middle.",

YES, log in and password \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.  They gave him the name of the Microsoft \"agent\" and he scared the \ud83d\udca9 out of my dad.  Telling him that the virus was going to wipe out every single bank account, unless this \"agent\" helped him.  He had to act now, and he had to take all his money out and put it in crypto currency where it would be safe.  They told him not to tell anyone and that the virus was \"listening\" to his phone calls, so he had to use someone else's phone while doing this.  They were able to drain one bank account, but they couldn't immediately drain the other one since it takes about 24 hrs to make such a large withdrawal.  We were able to stop that withdrawal thank God, but they are supposed to call him today with instructions on how to move all of his money into a crypto \"safe place\".  \n\nI tell you guys, my blood was boiling.  Not surprised about the scam \"steps\" that they used, but I was really surprised that he fell for it.  Someone said that this could have all started on facebook, and I have no doubt that this whole thing started out that way.",

Also good to call police and record the conversation as well when and if they call. You could also not pick up the phone. Seems like he got the virus from a porn site or something. Dude is old and just did not grow up in the environment. If they stole the cryptocurrency, you can trace all of the transactions and if they have them on an exchange you can contact them, provide proof and have the crypto assets frozen. Idk much but might need someone with more experience with this. I suggest posting in r/ Bitcoin and other subs aswell, becareful there are scammers there too.",

Anyway in one instance the credit card company reimbursed the charges and the other time she was screwed. The first time I went over and used some free trial malware stuff and found she had some kind of bogus web browser causing all the issues. The second time I went over and threw away the computer and gave her an iPad. She loves it has less risk on stuff like this. Every time I go to visit I make sure to touch base on scams and be very careful with emails and phone calls .",

Any country eliminating cash and switching to CBDC are simply forcing people to use Bitcoin instead as well",

                    "response": "Here is some general advice.\n\n1)\tDo you have high interest debt (5% and higher) and no savings?\n\nIf the answer is Yes - Do not invest in any Bitcoin. (you can use bitcoin to save money but don't speculate with it as an investment)\n\n2)\tDo you have any credit card debt and fiat savings?\n\nIf the answer is Yes ,than at minimum pay off all your credit card debt with fiat savings unless you are in debt to such a degree and plan on filing bankruptcy. Do not invest in Bitcoin until you have paid off all high interest debt\n\n3)\tHave a lot of low interest credit card debt (below 5%) and no fiat savings?\n\nYou should make a budget , cut expenses, and simultaneously start paying off your debt(unless you plan to file chapter 7 bankruptcy) , start saving a fiat emergency fund, and start buying Bitcoin.\n\n4)\tHave no debt and no fiat savings?\n\nYou should make a budget , cut expenses, start simultaneously saving for 6-12 months worth of living expenses in fiat emergency fund (only stable forms of fiat, obviously not the Argentinian peso or Venezuelan bolivar) and invest in Bitcoin, and seriously consider investing in stocks(preferable an index fund ETF like SPDR) or a IRA.\n\n5) You have a large amount of fiat savings and no debt and want to know if its best to dollar cost average invest or invest it all immediately?\n\nThe answer almost always is to make a plan and invest 100% of the fiat (not including your emergency fund) immediately in a diversified portfolio of investments that are non correlated (land, stocks, Bitcoin, businesses with positive cash flow) . It is often impossible to time the market and those that invest earlier will gain the most compound interest. The reason why dollar cost average investment is popular and a fine strategy is merely because most people don't have a large amount of fiat to invest upfront so invest a little each time they are paid.\n\nHere is a useful tool for you - https://dcabtc.com\n\nThus if you get paid twice a month than what you should do is buy some Bitcoin immediately twice a month and also in addition set buy limit orders on an exchange for 5-10% below spot price. If those orders do not get filled by  the following paycheck than buy your set amount and reset the buy limit orders for 5-10% below spot price from the current market price.\nThe reason for this is 2 fold:\n\n1)\tyou can auto pickup savings with BTC volatility on the dips which is psychologically rewarding\n\n2)\tIf a large amount of people create large amounts of Buy limit support than BTC becomes more stable unit of account and more liquid leading to more investor confidence and making BTC more of a currency(less volatility = better unit of account) and thus increases the likelihood your investment will continue appreciating in value.\n\n\nThe reason having a fiat savings account is so important is it not only will it save you if you lose a job or have an unexpected car expense or medical bill, but that it makes you a more rational investor that is less stressed out by the volatility in your more risky investments like Bitcoin. Bitcoin historically has had at least 2 bear markets lasting a little over 1 year thus you need to be prepared to not be forced to sell at a loss for at least 2 years to give yourself enough of a buffer.",

Exchanges get hacked. So don't leave your money sitting there. Use a hardware wallet.\n2. Use multiple exchanges. If you're on Coinbase, try another exchange Binance. \n3. Ledger and Trezor are good hardware wallets that I use personally. Have a look at some reviews and see which one is right for you.\n4. Don't FOMO into a coin because someone is trying to promote it. Ask yourself things like \"What problem does it solve? Are there other coins that do this already?\"\n5. If you don't need to sell, don't sell. The market will come back in time. \n6. Understand that some \"gurus\" / \"youtubers\" / \"podcasters\" are there to sell ads or get income from affiliate sales. Their advice should be taken with a grain of salt. Do your own research. \n7. The people who give you financial advice, but then say \"oh but that's not financial advice\" are not the people you should be listening to. \n8. See point 1. Exchanges get hacked. Don't leave you money there. \n9. Only spend what you can afford to lose. Ask yourself, \"If I lost all of this money today, would it affect me? Would I lose sleep over it? Would it negatively impact my life?\". If the answer is yes, then don't spend it !!!\n\nHope this gives you some things to think about.",

They isolate the private key creation , storage , and tx signing so they are better than just using a software wallet alone however \n\n> Ledger.com eventually goes bankrupt and their app/website is offline? \n\nI would avoid that hardware wallet but most hardware wallets use standard BIP39 backups so can be used with other hardware or software wallets . It doesn't matter if the company disappears\n\n>?You still can\u2019t get to the Bitcoin because the hardware wallet only works with the Ledger.com website?\n\nThats not how hardware wallets work , you aren't forced to use trezor suite or ledger live . You can use hardware wallets with many independent software wallets \n\n> Do you still invest in other cryptocurrencies on a long-term basis?\n\n99% of altcoins are scams (not all are) but this is offtopic here\n\n>The problem is always the long-term and life expectancy\n\nThan just stick with bitcoin , because most altcoins will disappear or lose 99.9% of their value and are just pump and dumps",

If on the other hand, you believe that the exchange can take care of your coins better than you can (I prefer to have them in the exchange than in a hot wallet) you can diversify the risk of loss by having part in your hard wallet and part in the exchange, but then their security will not depend on you but on a third party, which is not necessarily wrong.   \n\n\n*\\*Just so as not to create misunderstandings, I would like to clarify that \"cryptocurrencies\" are in the blockchain, not in the hardware wallet.

The most common, secure form of 2FA is TOTP (Time-based One Time Passwords), which is frequently linked with the Google Authenticator app, although the TOTP system is an open standard and many alternative apps exist for it. TOTP apps don't need an internet connection once installed (although they do need a clock that's somewhat accurate), so you can just use an old smartphone or tablet for this purpose.",

It should be noted that less bitcoin is lost these days and less will be lost in the future as the value goes up.\n\nThis is not the same as gold because with gold the larger the price increases the more incentive there exists to mine and find gold and with gold large amounts can be found like with asteroid mining.\n\nIn 2026 Psyche will start reporting back to NASA the expected reality that there will a sudden hyper-inflationary spike in the volume of gold being mined in the near future\nhttps://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/psyche/\nSince psyche 16 asteroid represents an example of an asteroid that is a core of an early planet thus metallic and estimated to contain around $700 quintillion dollars of precious metals (gold, platinum, etc..) or 93 billion dollars of precious metals per person.\nWhile mining will not start immediately, the markets will start pricing in the expectation of mining and nation states will start to slowly sell their gold reserves if they are wise enough flooding the market with cheap gold.\n\nNation states will need an alternative asset to hedge against.\n\n-----------------------\n\n>I guess my question is, how is this better than the current monetary system, and how can it act as a universal currency when its supply cannot be replenished? \n\nThe supply does not need to be replenished ever because Bitcoin is so divisible, (13 decimal places in a payment channel) the total amount doesn't matter because even if Bitcoin is worth 100 million a coin you can still have enough divisibility to buy a cup of coffee. \n\n**There is plenty of parts to go around** \n\nDivisibility is not the same thing as increased inflation either as 1 usd = 4 quarters = 10 dimes = 100 pennies with purchasing power and inflation only occurs when another dollar is printed to drive down the spending power of each dollar.\n\nIf your concerns are with slight economic deflation vs inflation\n\nI personally prefer slight deflation for these reasons :\n\n1)\tEncourages people to invest in things they really need instead of unnecessary fluff and short term desires which is good for society and the environment\n\n2)\tencourages more savings instead of debt slavery which removes choice, confidence and power away from individuals\n\n\n3)\tkeeps fiat currency in check where too much inflation will cause more capital flight to Bitcoin and prevents corrupt governments from abusing the backdoor tax of inflation\n\n4) Reduces the negative cantillon effect of fiat by removing some of the control over currency from a small group of people that is in part due to fiat being inflationary\nhttps://fee.org/articles/the-cantillon-effect-because-of-inflation-we-re-financing-the-financiers/\n\n>what factors are actually propping the value of Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is very valuable and useful money. \n\n1) **Save money** -  I like to save money with various services like lolli.com, ln.pizza ,foldapp.com,purse.io, or bitrefill.com (Bitcoin achieves this by credit and gift card arbitrage opportunities thus creating an efficiency)\n\n2) **Digital Gold** - Bitcoin is very desirable and scarce and since it is an uncorrelated asset class your portfolio is better hedged to be a safer way of finding alpha\n\n3) **Timestamping** - Tweetstamp, and opentimestamps are useful timestamping tools \n\n4) **Insurance** - If my bank account or credit cards get lost or stolen or account is frozen Bitcoin is a great alternative to store value\n\n5) **Censorship Resistance**- I can make donations to organizations like defense distributed or wikileaks even if their payment processors and banks are shutoff due to unethical political pressure\n\n6) **Sovereignty** - As a Business I can accept value even if I am deplatformed or banned from banking \n\n7) **Micro transactions** microtxs are simply not possible with fiat , where I  can do so with my BTC lightning wallet\n\n8) **Security** SSS and multisig with CLTV and other scripts allow for novel methods to secure ones wealth\n\n9) **Privacy** with electronic fiat I have no privacy unlike with Bitcoin transactions where I am given a choice between privacy or transparency with each wallet\n\n10)\t**Global** I can travel the world , rent hotels and buy plane tickets and withdraw local currency easily without fears of credit card fraud.

Personally I also do not like inflation and the hypercapitalist military industrial complex it funds, but I don't think that a deflationary system is necessarily good either. It means that people will be extremely shrewd with savings and perhaps even try to coast through life on the gains made from saving Bitcoin, not unlike how rich people currently rest on their laurels with their stock portfolios. I would prefer instead for the purchasing power of a dollar to remain the exact same today as it is 10 years in the future. \n\nAnd the whole hedge as inflation thing is very dependent on how much bitcoin is adopted. It has currently two things working against it, in my view. One is the overly aggressive saving culture it encourages (the only difference between a Bitcoin society and our current one is that instead of stocks, the rich will hoard value in coins), the other is the many (powerful) governments working against it because Bitcoin is a threat to fiat. \n\nA lot of the pros that you list of Bitcoin are certainly good things, but I can see them being abused as well. Harder to trace + private transactions are useful tools for hit men, drug dealers, and distributers of child pornography. Allowing deplatformed individuals to continue their business could mean allowing extremists to operate without consequence. And, it could also work against even regular people. If your wallet is hacked you're shit out of luck. If you lose money from your credit card, banks can at least make a decent effort to recover lost funds. \n\nI guess in the end it all depends on whether you trust individuals more or the government more, and that's going to be informed largely by what country you live in.",

IMHO i don't think it matters much as long as enough liquidity exists that the currency is stable which is not the case for bitcoin at the moment but what we hope will eventually occur with more liquidity in due time. \n\n>It means that people will be extremely shrewd with savings \n\nThis is what is suggested would happen with scary terms such as \"deflationary death spiral\" but thus far Bitcoin has proven this incorrect. During period of high deflation(appreciation) tx velocity tends to increase and merchant processors actually see an increase in spending for goods and services and charitable giving in Bitcoin.\n\nThis is believed to be caused by the feeling of newfound wealth(because they are wealthier) eventually overrides their desire to \"hoard\" (when did savings become a negative thing?) their Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is already testing some economic theories and proving them somewhat inaccurate but the data gathering is far from over and we all have a lot to learn .\n\n>I would prefer instead for the purchasing power of a dollar to remain the exact same today as it is 10 years in the future.\n\none research paper suggested this as a target but in reality it can only be a target because no government yet has been able to achieve this \n\n>whole hedge as inflation thing is very dependent on how much bitcoin is adopted.\n\nBitcoin being disinflationary means it will be a hedge against inflation even with 0 new adoption. New adoption simply means bitcoin appreciates much more rapidly against fiat. \n\n>One is the overly aggressive saving culture it encourages\n\nThis is a false impression that doesn't match with reality. Every bull market thus far where rapid deflation occurs more spending and giving occurs. \n\n>Harder to trace + private transactions are useful tools for hit men, drug dealers, and distributers of child pornography.\n\nThe US dollar dominates these areas and these are things that will never disappear. bitcoin at least doesn't as easily help governments commit war crimes, genocide and democide like fiat does. Imagine if putin had to pay for his war with bitcoin.\n\n>deplatformed individuals to continue their business could mean allowing extremists to operate without consequence.\n\nIf someone commits a crime they should be prosecuted. monetary freedom is akin to freedom of expression and it is very dangerous allowing a small group of corrupt individuals to restrict how people express their values. \n\n>If your wallet is hacked you're shit out of luck.\n\nBitcoin being a bearer asset is more akin to cash or gold in its security assumptions but much more secure because losing your wallet doesn't mean you lost your bitcoin. Digital fiat can be vulnerable in many ways with many kinds of theft that bitcoin is not vulnerable to as well. There are nuances between the two , but you don't need to choose one or the other and can use both \n\n>If you lose money from your credit card, banks can at least make a decent effort to recover lost funds.\n\nYou are also much more prone to a merchant double charging you , or continuing a subscription charge without your wishes , or identity theft , or asset forfeiture or civil forfeiture with cards and banks. There are nuanced differences between the two\n\n>depends on whether you trust individuals more or the government more,\n\nIts not an either or choice. This is a false dichotomy. Use bitcoin as a tool. Bonds and Tbills are no longer wise investments because they can't beat inflation so you lost one uncoorelated asset class in your portfolio and need to replace it with bitcoin to be hedged and diversified. Bitcoin is very useful money as well that you can use worldwide. What happens if you card is frozen , stolen, or lost travelling? With bitcoin you are fine.",

We already have seen this in a few examples where governments try and stop bitcoin by making bitcoin illegal and all it does is drive up a premium for that bitcoin.\n\n>but how is it that if you lose your wallet you don't lose your Bitcoin?\n\nMany people have a cell wallet with petty amounts of bitcoin and a hardware wallet for their main savings. If either your cell phone or hardware wallet gets stolen , lost or damaged you don't lose anything and the thieves cannot steal your bitcoin. Thieves cannot steal your bitcoin because you have a pin or passphrase even if the theif finds your fingerprint or cell pin and you don't lose your bitcoin because your backup words written on metal or paper recover your bitcoin . Here is the interesting thing as well. 12 words is enough to recover all your bitcoin and is a one time future proof backup that will recover any future btc you have as well without re-making a backup. \n\nAt the most basic level you thus need to focus on keeping your bitcoin backup words private and secure like gold . But unlike with gold you can use a passphrase or multisig where even if someone finds your words they can't steal your bitcoin . thus bitcoin can start to become much more secure than cash or gold.",

                    "response": "Lets discuss some of the properties of what makes a good currency and where Bitcoin fits now compared to gold and fiat\n\n\n**1) Durability** = Gold is best here due to its history and physical nature. Bitcoin and fiat  being digital in nature means we must compare the  durability of the institution/network that issues and secures them. I would suggest that Bitcoin will slightly excel responsible nation states here and does far better than  unreliable forms of fiat when looking at the history of fiat compared the the history and properties of Bitcoin(2017 gave a lot of credibility to Bitcoin in it thwarting a powerful attack and nation states have repeatedly attacked Bitcoin to one degree or another)\n\n**2) Portability** = Gold is horrible in this category being physical, heavy and unable to be sent digitally(custodians don't count as you lose most the benefits of gold and it switched categories from a bearer asset to registered value). Bitcoin beats fiat here too as its peer to peer , global and lacks regulatory friction. \n\n**3) Fungibility** Gold and bitcoin tie here. When comparing fiat to Bitcoin it is more complicated but Bitcoin beats fiat here overall and is significantly getting better each year. Physical fiat has some advantages over Bitcoin in the sense that its easier to have strong privacy locally as long as the whole \"anonymity set\" (group of users) avoid depositing the fiat in ATMs and banks(physical cash has serial numbers that are tracked with OCR + bill readers everywhere). Bitcoin can be very private if you use the right wallet and you take precautions but if you make a mistake onchain you can also have problems. Bitcoin being used with a lightning wallet is extremely private by default and chain analysis is useless. Digital fiat isn't very fungible or private at all. Gold isn't as fungible as many people suggest either due to different grading, certifying prices, forms which all fetch different prices.\n\n**4) Scarcity** -- Bitcoin wins this hands down with a fixed and limited supply. ~2-4 million BTc have been permanently lost/destroyed and many people also a long term investors leading to more scarcity. Gold is a distant 2nd with concerns in asteroid mining - (Psyche 16 as an example) and not knowing if any other large deposit can be found but far superior to fiat. \n\n**5) Divisibility** Bitcoin is already divisible by 8 decimal places onchain and 1/1000 of a satoshi on other layers like lightning. Thus micro txs are possible with bitcoin and too impractical with gold and not as easily done with fiat due to regulatory friction  and costs. The idea is that machines and software can tip other software, machines, and services by the minute or second to allow for more granularity and thus more efficiency with lower prices.\n\n**6) Acceptability** - Fiat wins this category for the time being due to its acceptance worldwide , especially US dollars. Bitcoin being a global currency without regulatory friction can one day overtake even the most accepted fiat however. Almost no one accepts gold for payment so its last and this is unlikely to change. \n\n**7) Verifiability** - Bitcoin wins here slightly over gold and fiat. Gold can be verified but takes more effort and there are concerns with tungsten filled bars and fake gold. Bitcoin being swept from a private key(coin or paper) or accepting an open dime is better than fiat physical cash, and digital fiat has very large concerns and delays in verification (chargebacks, fraud, etc...)\n\n**8) stability as a unit of account** - While Bitcoin is better than certain forms of fiat in this category, most are more stable than bitcoin and so Bitcoin remains 3rd compared to fiat and gold. We hope that Bitcoin in time will become less volatile with a much larger market cap . This trend is already occurring ,and much economic theory supports this happening but its still an experiment as to how long it will take and what size market cap / liquidity is needed\n\nSo you can see bitcoin is already better than fiat in 6 of the 8 categories above and the 2 remaining categories just take time.",

This doesn't increase the supply or diminish BTC's value. As more BTC is lost forever it drives up the value of the remaining BTC, increased scarcity. \n\n  \n**Supply Distribution:**\n\nBitcoin's supply is highly distributed today across addresses and entities. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it, buying it, working for it or attracting investment through entrepreneurship. Today there is a strong incentive to hold Bitcoin and not spend it because its value is still rising rapidly. In the future the rate at which it increases in value will level off. As it levels off the incentive to hold reduces and incentive to spend increases.    \n\n\nBecause Bitcoin is designed to increase in value forever it will fundamentally change human incentive in many dimensions. Using Bitcoin to improve your quality of life will happen. That means spending it on homes, comforts, investments, etc. We will see a rapid decline in frivolous spending. Sats are too valuable to not be spent on things that REALLY matter, that REALLY provide an improvement to our lives.   \n\n\n**FIAT Collapse & Bitcoin's Rise:**   \nBitcoin is valuable because the supply is capped and fixed at 21m. This protects and increases its purchasing power over time. \n\n  \nBitcoin is valuable because it's decentralized and distributed globally protecting it from being controlled, manipulated and destroyed.   \n\n\nBitcoin is valuable because it is immutable and permissionless. This protects every humans freedom, time, effort and ability to participate in the economy based on their contributions. No one can lock you out or hold you down. Think meritocracy.   \n\n\nThe problems with society stemming from fiat and the collapse of fiat causing a semi temporary collapse in society is not what gives Bitcoin value. Bitcoin's attributes and properties exist with or without fiat and with or without all the problems fiat causes.   \n\n\n  \nGreat questions and thoughts, thank you for sharing. It gave me an opportunity to think about how to answer and share it.   \n\n\nBravo...keep digging! #ClearMined",

                    "response": "> Is a wallet app only accessible on one device at a time or can you log in and out from multiple places at any time?\n\nThat depends on the type of wallet application.\n\nThe critical piece of data are the \"private keys\" that allow you to spend your funds. Most modern wallets store these in the form of something akin to a \"master private key\", which is called the \"seed\". In principle, you can use this seed on as many devices as you'd like and have each device be able to fully control your funds, but the more devices that store this seed, the greater the risk of someone else gaining access to it.\n\nInstead, some wallet implementations allow you to create \"watch-only\" wallets, that let you monitor your funds, but not control them. So you could have your seed stored securely on one device (such as a hardware wallet), but with a watch-only version on several other devices, letting you check your funds all the time, while keeping the seed as secure as possible.\n\nFinally, there are custodial wallets. These wallets place the keys in the hands of someone else, the company running the service. You can log in through a webpage from anywhere and both monitor and manage your funds. The main downside of custodial wallets is that you're at the mercy of the wallet operator. If they decide to not like you anymore or to go out of business completely, you lose access to your funds. So while convenient to use, custodial wallets are not recommended for anything beyond small amounts of spending money.\n\n> If you have a hardware wallet does it need to be \"online\" to receive coins at the time of the transaction?\n\nNo. The coins aren't sent to the hardware wallet. The device only holds the keys to access the coins.\n\n> If you buy coins from say a coinbase exchange, and receive coins from other sources, what is the best way to see your current totals and value, and keep track of the transactions?\n\nMost wallet applications will show you an overview of transactions and account balances. If you just want to see what you've received and sent and when, as well as your current balance, then pretty much all wallets will do that for you as that is quite basic functionality.",

I suggest you investigate lightning wallets , coinjoin , payjoin , and new tricks like \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/t3gy74/teleport_a_coinswap_implementation_alpha_release/\n\nThe real question is if you need immediate privacy for a transaction/purchase that requires it today or you are concerned about long term privacy ?",

Bitcoin can fluctuate 1-5% daily in volatility on average but sometimes we see more like the ~10% jump like we say yesterday\n\nIf you spend and replace bitcoin like many of us do it solves 2 concerns : Not having regrets about missing out on any gains and not effected by volatility as you are merely using bitcoin as a payment rail to save money in stores like :\n\nhttp://ln.pizza  - save 6 % off dominoes Pizza in the USA with lightning wallet\n\nhttps://purse.io  Save 10-20% off amazon \n\nhttps://foldapp.com - save up to 20%  Starbucks, Uber, Target , whole foods , Dunkin \n\nhttps://www.lolli.com \u2013 save up to 30% by spending BTC anywhere but primarily USA stores\n\nhttps://stekking.com - save up to 20% by spending BTC anywhere but primarily Europe stores\n\n\n2) I suggest you watch at least two of the wallet videos in the pinned FAQ \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/g42ijd/faq_for_beginners/\n\nOne of the videos of a mobile wallet where you have a pin and backup seed word list and the other from a hardware wallet where you have a pin + hw wallet + sometimes passphrase. You should read about the importance in keeping your backup seed words private and secure\n\n>And you can have multiple wallets?\n\nAs many as you want \n\n3) Avoid that exchange as they are running a ponzi and might be fractional and have very high fees . Read the exchanges in the pinned FAQ .",

Because it is still new, and business decides how it's going to use it, and government talks about regulating it, it is going to continue to be a sort of roller coaster.  \n\n2.  The wallet has a key.  once you decide what other wallet you are going to make a payment to, it will ask for your key.  Which is a sort of password, so NEVER give it out.  If a person gets your address and your key, they can get access to your wallet.\n\n3.  It is usually pretty instant once you have USD/Euro in the exchange to go from that to bitcoin and back again.  Getting from your bank to the exchange depends on how you move the money.  ACH is slow.  Wire is fast.  Debit Card is in the middle.",

(you can use bitcoin to save money but don't speculate with it as an investment)\n\n2)\tDo you have any credit card debt and fiat savings?\n\nIf the answer is Yes ,than at minimum pay off all your credit card debt with fiat savings unless you are in debt to such a degree and plan on filing bankruptcy. Do not invest in Bitcoin until you have paid off all high interest debt\n\n3)\tHave a lot of low interest credit card debt (below 5%) and no fiat savings?\n\nYou should make a budget , cut expenses, and simultaneously start paying off your debt(unless you plan to file chapter 7 bankruptcy) , start saving a fiat emergency fund, and start buying Bitcoin.\n\n4)\tHave no debt and no fiat savings?\n\nYou should make a budget , cut expenses, start simultaneously saving for 6-12 months worth of living expenses in fiat emergency fund (only stable forms of fiat, obviously not the Argentinian peso or Venezuelan bolivar) and invest in Bitcoin, and seriously consider investing in stocks(preferable an index fund ETF like SPDR) or a IRA.\n\n5) You have a large amount of fiat savings and no debt and want to know if its best to dollar cost average invest or invest it all immediately?\n\nThe answer almost always is to make a plan and invest 100% of the fiat (not including your emergency fund) immediately in a diversified portfolio of investments that are non correlated (land, stocks, Bitcoin, businesses with positive cash flow) . It is often impossible to time the market and those that invest earlier will gain the most compound interest. The reason why dollar cost average investment is popular and a fine strategy is merely because most people don't have a large amount of fiat to invest upfront so invest a little each time they are paid.\n\nHere is a useful tool for you - https://dcabtc.com\n\nThus if you get paid twice a month than what you should do is buy some Bitcoin immediately twice a month and also in addition set buy limit orders on an exchange for 5-10% below spot price. If those orders do not get filled by  the following paycheck than buy your set amount and reset the buy limit orders for 5-10% below spot price from the current market price.\nThe reason for this is 2 fold:\n\n1)\tyou can auto pickup savings with BTC volatility on the dips which is psychologically rewarding\n\n2)\tIf a large amount of people create large amounts of Buy limit support than BTC becomes more stable unit of account and more liquid leading to more investor confidence and making BTC more of a currency(less volatility = better unit of account) and thus increases the likelihood your investment will continue appreciating in value.\n\n\nThe reason having a fiat savings account is so important is it not only will it save you if you lose a job or have an unexpected car expense or medical bill, but that it makes you a more rational investor that is less stressed out by the volatility in your more risky investments like Bitcoin. Bitcoin historically has had at least 2 bear markets lasting a little over 1 year thus you need to be prepared to not be forced to sell at a loss for at least 2 years to give yourself enough of a buffer.",

Exchanges get hacked. So don't leave your money sitting there. Use a hardware wallet.\n2. Use multiple exchanges. If you're on Coinbase, try another exchange Binance. \n3. Ledger and Trezor are good hardware wallets that I use personally. Have a look at some reviews and see which one is right for you.\n4. Don't FOMO into a coin because someone is trying to promote it. Ask yourself things like \"What problem does it solve? Are there other coins that do this already?\"\n5. If you don't need to sell, don't sell. The market will come back in time. \n6. Understand that some \"gurus\" / \"youtubers\" / \"podcasters\" are there to sell ads or get income from affiliate sales. Their advice should be taken with a grain of salt. Do your own research. \n7. The people who give you financial advice, but then say \"oh but that's not financial advice\" are not the people you should be listening to. \n8. See point 1. Exchanges get hacked. Don't leave you money there. \n9. Only spend what you can afford to lose. Ask yourself, \"If I lost all of this money today, would it affect me? Would I lose sleep over it? Would it negatively impact my life?\". If the answer is yes, then don't spend it !!!\n\nHope this gives you some things to think about.",

Miners pick that up and add it to the next block. Part of the transaction is a fee to the miners, which is what insensitives them to include your transaction in the next block.\n\nAn address is a pair of numbers. The one you see is the public key. It's recorded on the Blockchain ledger so everyone knows how much BTC is associated with it. The other number is the private key. It allows that BTC to be transferred to another address by a cryptographic signature authorizing the transaction. The signature proves mathematiclly that you have the private key matching the public key and therefore own that BTC. This proof is why you don't need a trusted middle man (a.k.a. and exchange).",

Dealing with an exchange is a point of trust: you have to trust the exchange that they let you transfer your coins out in the end. That's why it's recommended to NOT let your coins on there for longer periods of time (or any periods, for that matter).  \n\n> I want to see what the balance is, if any. How do I see if there\u2019s any Bitcoin left? Is there a way to determine which of the 2 keys I have is the private or public?  \n\nIt's possible to recognize them because pubkeys and privkeys have different formats, but I can't help with it from my memory right now. You can try importing either of those into a proper wallet like Electrum: https://electrum.org/ (and play around with different ways of importing them, as depending on how your previous wallet was created, it might show a 0 balance even if it's not empty, so you might need to figure out the \"right\" recovery settings.. but it's not that many, so don't worry).",

When you withdraw from the exchange, the desired amount of bitcoin is transferred from the exchange's wallet to your wallet. The keys in your wallet are your own and have never been seen by anybody but you. You dont transfer the keys. You transfer bitcoin between addresses controlled by different keys. \n\n>Just two strings of characters.

So... in one sense if you have coins in a place that has errr 'oversight', and you've lied to them they can in theory 'freeze' your stuff as long as it's there. Once you send them to a wallet you control, they no longer have any access/control/input over your BTC at all whatsoever.... There will still be a record of it (forever), that you had x number of coins and moved them to this new wallet, and you could someday be on the hook for taxes if you sell the BTC at a profit but no one can take them from you or your wallet once they are moved.  \n\n\nThat said if you are moving them from say one exchange to another exchange... you are still letting the new exchange have some level of control over your coins. based on what you've described I'd say go ahead and move them, and don't worry too much about it.",

Well, the taxes part is, technically, but only if you sell the bitcoin for cash or cash equivalent. \n\nAnyone can setup a \"node.\" A node is a part of the network that assists with transactions, & is a core part of the infrastructure. You end up downloading all or a recent part of the blockchain, & your node helps verify transactions. Note: this is NOT the same thing as mining. \n\nThis node then becomes your wallet, as well. \n\nThen, you can acquire crypto a few different ways without purchasing via Paypal and such. It could be as simple as giving cash to a friend who is willing to buy via a centralized exchange. It could be as involved as setting up your own mining rig. Either way, you can get coin that is anonymous. \n\nHowever, anonymity & privacy aren't necessarily the point. They CAN be, and there a projects dedicated to that. But, the point at a larger scale, is a more democratic monetary system. In the case of most cryptocurrency right now, that resulted in non-private blockchains. But there's no philosophical reason that has to be the case, it was just the simplest secure way for the first iterations. \n\nFinally, it's important to understand WHY cryptocurrency is more democratic. Open source code is at the core of it. Anyone can look at the code, & draw conclusions from it. That doesn't mean everyone has to or should, but they can. But this means the currency is FAIR. There's no central bank printing money for someone else while you & I are left in the lurch. With crypto, you, the big guys, & I, all play by the same rules. \n\nTaxes? Death & taxes & all that.

You can learn a lot more about it if you go watch some intro videos or do some reading. \n\nTo answer your questions: \n-\tBitcoin can be anonymous. Most exchanges/wallets record your personal identifying info as a legal precaution to protect themselves. You can get an anonymous wallet right now. Go look up \u201cpaper wallets\u201d. \n-\tYou actually don\u2019t need 3rd parties to use it. You can go meet someone in person and buy Bitcoin from them. You can install software on your computer and send/receive money yourself. This software is open source and non profit. You could write the software yourself. It\u2019s just way easier for people to use 3rd parties when they don\u2019t know how else to do it. Again, go do some reading. This stuff is really easy to find.  \n-\tsure, you have to pay taxes on it. We all have to pay taxes on everything. But if someone were trying to commit tax fraud and avoid the IRS, they could (pretty easily) go get an anonymous wallet, make anonymous transactions, and hold/spend money away from the eyes of the IRS. Again, that\u2019s tax fraud, but it\u2019s pretty easy to do with Bitcoin if you wanted to hide your assets. Just because I feel like I need to say it based on your questions - Don\u2019t do tax fraud. You won\u2019t win. It\u2019s not worth it.",

But we have to accept it for now so that businesses, who don't want to break the law, can safely accept crypto.\n\nYears from now, when crypto is so deeply integrated into the economy that nobody can stop using it, we can start using it like cash.  By then it will be more valuable too so, the incentive for having it now is delayed gratification.",

The snail mail system is too slow and insecure  \n\nBefore Bitcoin all on-line transactions were processed by centralized payment gateways which adopt the role of gatekeeper, choose who is allowed to participate, and which transactions are permitted. This is not regular money. It is oppression  \n\nDo you actually use regular money? Or do you happily allow the payment gatekeepers to oppress you?",

You would then pay them locally, or even use your fiat wallet that you mentioned for international transactions.\n\nLocal Bitcoins seems to operate in Pakistan, but you need to be extra careful.  Local Bitcoins is where you transfer locally in PKR, but you dont know who you are dealing with - could be a scam.  In addition, the markup could be as high as 20% vs. International prices.\n\nCan you also have a look at Paxful?  I have no experience, but this is another site where you can find local sellers.  Some take payment via local transfer, some take Gift cards and so on.  Again, the mark up is huge...\n\nAssume you have spent enough time downloading a Bitcoin Wallet, safeguarded the seed (24 words), have your Bitcoin rcv address etc.  All the best.\n\nYou may want to check out / consider joining a group like this - https://bitcoinpk.org/",

The same way a bank does not build a safe specifically for your money, they just pool it all together and keep a record of who owns what. There's valid technical reasons for that.\n\nThe question you should ask is if they in fact have enough currency to cover everyone's IOUs, or if they are doing fractional assuming not everyone will withdraw at once.\n\n\"providing me an address and a nice interface to look at?\"\n\nThey create a new address pointing to THEIR wallet, and when they get money into that address they \"credit\" that amount to you in their database. \n\nThey could never, even if they wanted to, give you a private key for your funds, simply because they are all pooled together in a big vault.",

They only have their wallet, and your bitcoin sits in it. When you generate a deposit address, that address is an inflow to their wallet, and gets folded in with the rest in a batch transaction. You dont have your own addresses or bitcoin there.

It always lives on the blockchain. The only thing you *do* take possession of are the private keys.\n\nThe private key is the \"proof of ownership\" when it comes to crypto.\n\nHardware devices should be not be looked at as a thing \"where I store my coin\" but more along the lines of \"a convenience tool that stores my seed offline, allowing me to quickly sign transactions\".\n\nThe hardware key will break. Trezor might not exist in 10 years. However, the seed will never go away.\n\nIn theory, if you remember your BIP39 keyphrase, the \"map\" to your crypto is stored in your head. This is why crypto is so world changing. You can literally cross borders naked and still have your money available to you. You just need to download a new wallet app, import your seed and now you have access to your coin.\n\nIt's beautiful and perfect. Immaculate conception.",

The long  answer is the person who has your phrase can now access the vast nothingness of your empty wallet. I guess they can have a look at previous transactions and stuff too, although that is public, it isn't easy to figure out who belongs to those transactions so I guess they now no your name and tx history. I don't think that can be monetised? It's not really useful information for most people. \n\nDon't put anything in it and get a new wallet.",

You say cold wallets allude you, so I'll focus on that. \n\nWhen you set up a cold wallet (or really any wallet) you are creating new private keys in that wallet to secure your crypto on blockchains. We use a seed phrase so you can reconstruct the same wallet addresses on different wallet software/hardware. \n\nWhen you setup your hardware wallet you will go through steps to configure it for the various currencies (blockchains) you have on coinbase. These steps will combine your seed phrase with the derive path (unique key for the blockchain) to create your personal private keys for sending and it's corresponding public key for receiving. This is somewhat of a simplification of what really goes on under the hood, but all you need to know is that your seed phrase will let you access your currency on any wallet you configure it to use - know that you should never use a cold wallet seed phrase on a hot wallet as that complete defeats the purpose of your cold wallet.\n\nOnce everything is setup, you send (withdraw) your crypto from Coinbase by giving it the public address you get from your hardware wallet. Different addresses will be available to you for each Blockchain you interact with.\n\nYou can continue to buy crypto from the same Coinbase account you have been using or any other exchange you wish. After you buy it, you then go through the same process to transfer it to your cold wallet.\n\nAll a transfer does is move numbers on the ledger from one public key (your Coinbase account) to another public key (your account on your hardware wallet).\n\nIf I missed what you were asking, lmk.",

It will make no difference to you, except opening up more possibilities for the wallet software you choose.\n\nThe long string is probably an xpub key (I think they start with xpub even), that's like a read-only (no spending) master key that matches all of the addresses of that wallet, and it's used when you want someone to be able to see the entire balance of the wallet. \n\nWithout it, each address (think of an address as a pile of coins, a wallet is composed of several such piles) is unrelated to the rest, and it can be difficult or even impossible for someone without the seed phrase to add them up. It's basically something helpful for you to easily check the entire balance, but should be shared with caution, or not at all preferably. It does NOT grant access to any spending.",

Using this logic, a Zimbabwean could call the USD, and ask whether the USD will ever \"stable\" so that its value stays at 1000 Zimbabwean Dollars?",

Over time, because of the people who control the flow of water, the bucket got smaller and smaller but they still called it 'one dollar's worth' of water, even though the value of that worth reduced over time. It went from a bucket, to a bowl, to a cup, and then to a spoonful of water that was still referred to as 'one dollar's worth'.      \nNow clearly, the amount of water (value) held by 'one dollar's worth' has diminished over time, based on the monetary policies which increase and decrease the money supply. And they use that constant controlled expansion and contraction to redistribute wealth from the common classes to the moneyed classes, in a cycle called 'inflation and deflation'.    \nIt's an ever-present rhythmic contraction that causes them to \"drink your milkshake\", as it were.  They sit on private and corporate treasure hordes of bonds, stocks, and dirty money earning massive interests while the common person just has to squeeze their body to the maximum every day just to earn daily sustenance.     \nIt's a sick system of perpetual injustice where the hand that gives is greater than the hand that receives, and they have made nearly every endeavor of life an transactional experience where you end up paying for the right of participation - home mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, paycheck advances, and so on.   \nCrypto is a huge family of various software and hardware technologies that thus far attempts to break the molds and machinations of the legacy financial & economic institutions, and hopefully will largely compete with or replace the corrupted core of the global economy.   \nBitcoin at this stage has largely proven itself to be most viable as a store of value independent of the financial overlord's direct control. On the other hand it could be completely vulnerable to state-level players at some point once they figure it out if they haven't already. The CIA, NSA, and partners are not sitting idle in the face of things.  Servants of the Fed Reserve at this point, as they are.   \n\n\nAnd who owns that Fed?  Take a look at FEDERAL RESERVE DIRECTORS: A STUDY OF CORPORATE AND BANKING INFLUENCE STAFF REPORT FOR THE COMMITTEE ON BANKING, CURRENCY AND HOUSING HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 94th Congress, Second Session AUGUST 1976  \n\n\nand you will see the network for yourself, as it was then. You have to study from there to see how the hydra has grown.  First step, watch full documentary The Money Masters.",

Do the security updates, but otherwise keep your PC offline until you are ready to download the blockchain.

Installed the legit wallet app. created wallet, wrote down recovery phrase, but do not remember generating an address.\n4. This is the problem: I was not asked to enter an address nor did I enter one. This simply furthers the assumption/deception that it going to my own Coinbase wallet. In other words, the entire purpose of the function within the app is presented as connecting your Coinbase account with your Coinbase wallet. Yes, I can see the details of the transaction from within the app, which uses [BTC.com](https://BTC.com).\n\nAgain, I have no idea how the destination address was chosen. And this is what makes the whole thing feel like a scam.

Once booted I'd download bitcoin core [https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/) and start it & immediately exit it. This will create a directory like \\~/.bitcoin with a file called wallet.dat. Override that file with yours and start core again. This will start attempting to sync the blockchain which will take a long time. So open up the debug console (window -> console) and run dumpwallet [https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/dumpwallet.html](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/dumpwallet.html) which will create a file in plain text. Now get electrum, which comes installed on tails. Create a new wallet using the import keys option. Paste your keys. It should show your balance straight away and you will be able to send. -- You can do the same thing offline if you do the downloads in advance eg onto another usb stick, but I don't think this adds a lot of security. At some point you need to connect that electrum to the internet to show the balance and send.\n\nEdit: early versions of bitcoin core did not use a seed at all. Each address was random. Later they went to HD seed. But this is not like bip39 with a mnemonic phrase.\n\nAnd RIP your inbox. Please ignore anyone that DMs you. They are all scammers. You got to do everything from public instructions. Don't give, show or send the wallet.dat to anyone.",

You won't be able to use some hardware wallets with your phone, but you can use a phone wallet ([bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io)) or pick a hardware wallet that can. \n\nA few things - \n\nCrypto is an umbrella term used to legitimize a lot of scams. But even if you believe some altcoins are legitimate, *none* of them are as decentralized as Bitcoin. They're really not in the same asset class.
