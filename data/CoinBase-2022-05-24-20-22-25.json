            "selftext": "Read this while you can before it gets taken down.\n\nFirst: don't panic. This is S.O.P. for all the big centralized exchanges. Coinbase, it seems, has done a worse job than others this downturn, and has seemingly learned nothing from past cycles.\n\nYes, you should be outraged. Yes, Coinbase (and Kraken and Binance) should be dragged in front of Congress. Yes, they will deserve the inevitable regulation they are going to get. (That we'll bear the burden of.)\n\nThe root of all of the nasty problems and support fubars showing up on this sub, are a result of one thing:\n\n# Not enough liquidity\n\nThat's it. But instead of Coinbase just publicly owning up to that (which to be fair would make it worse for everyone), we see things like:\n\n- Mysterious \"error messages\" when trying to cash out to bank, or move assets to a real blockchain address\n- Accounts mysteriously locked for no explainable reason - can't get in to own account\n- Accounts mysteriously *closed* for no explainable reason\n- KYC demanded for no explainable reason\n- KYC provided never seems to be \"good enough\" to unlock accounts\n- Unresponsive support\n- Suspiciously \"inept\" support that can't even answer basic questions\n- Bank account unlinked for no explainable reason, can't re-link\n\nThese problems seem hit \"mid-tier\" accounts the most - about $10k to $100k in total value. (Then trickle-down to lower-tier accounts as liquidity problems get worse.)\n\nWhy? Because freezing those accounts first provide the biggest bandaid agianst liquidity drain, with the fewest grumpy customers - with hopefully lower odds of hitting customers that have unlimited lawyers on standby, and millions of Twitter followers.\n\nKeep in mind, that all your \"balances\" that show up on Coinbase are just numbers in a database. IOUs, if you will. With the money you give them, they put *your* money to work for *them*. Using it to front-run your own orders, etc. Much like banks and brokerages do. But as soon as you try to cash out to your bank, or send crypto to a real external blockchain address, the money becomes \"real\" and they have to cough it up.\n\nAgain, this is not unique to Coinbase. Kraken and Binance do it too. Coinbase has just been worse about it, this particular cycle.\n\nThe solution? I don't have a magic bullet, only suggestions:\n\n1. Be patient. You'll get your money eventually.\n    1. Coinbase won't go bankrupt anytime soon.\n    1. Even if they get close, they'll be an incredibly attractive buyout target.\n1. **Be courteous, professional, and non-threatening**.\n    1. Don't give them a single excuse to hold your money hostage, because they are looking for one.\n1. Submit claims or reports to:\n    1. The [FTC](Https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/)\n    1. The [CFTC](https://forms.cftc.gov/Forms/Complaint/Screen1)\n    1. Your [congressional representative](https://forms.cftc.gov/Forms/Complaint/Screen1)\n    1. Your [state AG](https://www.usa.gov/state-attorney-general)\n    1. Your [US senator](https://www.senate.gov/senators/)\n1. Submit links or PDF copies of said cliams to Coinbase. (In a calm, professional manner as if it's just another day at work.)\n1. Post your experience on Reddit and/or Twitter. Also in a calm, professional, non-threatening manner.\n\nDisclaimer: Much of this information is based on experience and observation, and with partial mid-level inside company confirmation.\n\nIf anyone has other/better ideas, please add them!",

My CB account has been frozen, although not mysteriously.\n\nI've been a loyal customer of Coinbase since 2017, spending thousands of dollars in fees over the years. \n\nLast week Friday I purchased several thousand USDC coin to send to a broker who I've worked on deals with several times. As soon as I tried to send the funds to his wallet, Coinbase denied the transfer and then immediately locked my account... for 2 months! The reason told to me is that that wallet was flagged as 'fraudulent'. It's not. Like I said, it's someone I know. They refuse to give me any other reasons.\n\nSo for 2 months I can't trade/buy or transfer crypto. Support told me my only option is to either sell my holdings and transfer it back to my bank account, or wait 2 months (they recommended I just wait 2 months). I don't have a lot of money so can't afford to wait the 2 months and go purchase elsewhere. So I sell and send back to my bank account, which incurred another fee of $100. \n\nIn total, Coinbase charged me just shy of $350 in fees only to handcuff me and force a sellback. It's an unreasonable request to ask someone (especially a long-time customer) to wait 2 months. I submitted a support request, asking for my fees to be paid back to me, which I believe is only fair based on their actions.\n\nI have written back and forth with support several times and even though the headline of my support ticket is literally 'I'd like my fees to be refunded', support comes back again and again stating that their decision is final and that my account is frozen for 2 months, and nothing I can do will convince them otherwise, not once mentioning the fees. \n\nI don't think I'm asking for too much here. So frustrated. Can't believe I've given any money to these guys. Don't hold funds on large exchanges is still the best advice I've ever gotten in crypto.",

Maybe that will improve with competition over time.\n\nThose services are p2p and people accept a range of options, from XMR via in-person cash, to Paypal, etc. Selling is a little trickier than buying, risk-wise, which is why it's more expensive than buying from a CEX.\n\nPersonally, I increasingly just buy on CEXes, then move to private wallet and trade on a DEX (eg stuff on the Polygon network). \n\nBut to be fair, it can be very cheap and literally instant to day-trade on a CEX - because you are just trading IOUs (\"not your keys not your coins\" yada yada). There is no waiting on block confirmations, and no gas fees. (But a small fee to the CEX.) And the spreads are hard to beat. The trick is, you just keep a low enough amount on a CEX that you can afford it all getting suddenly locked up indefinitely - even lost forever, if the market tanks, or even if they run out or liquidity on just a specific volatile asset.\n\nSo, personally I try to avoid that. Esp after this crash, I'm done day-trading on CEXes.\n\n**I'm going 100% private wallet and decentralized exchanges-only from now on, Coinbase only for the momentary on/off-ramp to my bank**.\n\nYou do have to trust a DEX not to steal your money. *But* it's only at risk for the length of the transaction, a few seconds - otherwise it's in your own private wallet.\n\nDeFi limit orders, too, are also in principle safer than on a CEX, because both sides of the transaction are already verifiably locked up in a smart contract just waiting to execute. However, unless you've reviewed every line of code, it could still be a rug-pull - and it does happen - so you need to trust the service offering limit orders.",

My coinbase card started getting declined for no reason, took me a couple of days to realize that withdrawals was suspended and the account was held.\n\nTickets went unresponded to for a couple days so I called and they had me reverify my identity with no explanation. I tried to talk to the chat thing to find out why it happened, but I got a bunch of canned responses about confirming my personal information and how they can't tell me about security policy or some bs. Everything was working at this point. I was specifically asking for evidence about unauthorized access to my account, and the responses just were totally disconnected like a bot.\n\nThis makes perfect sense really. Withdrawing everything as we speak.",

I want my portfolio to grow. That means mainstream adoption. That means easy-peasy services. That means Matt Damon advertising (whether specifically a good idea or not in that case). That means *trustable* services - which of course Coinbase is not. That means your (or someone's) elderly mom jumping in without fear.\n\nBut most noobs just put their money in a CEX and leave it there. They just don't know. And that *should* be OK. (And, in fact, it almost always is except when they freak the hell out when there's no liquidity and they get problems like this.)\n\nJust because you and I think that's suicidal, doesn't mean *that is just what new entrants do*. Almost universally. They are programmed to do *exactly that* by billions of dollars in advertising - you and I can't compete against that. And *we need an exponentially growing curve of new entrants*.\n\nI don't know what the answer is. Maybe, in part, regulation (an idea that in turn makes many crypto maxi heads explode). But even then, what would that look like? It would almost certainly punish the end users - not the Coinbase C suite, board, or other major shareholders.\n\nBut I do know that mocking or criticizing new entrants for their pain and suffering at the hands of Coinbase and other CEXes, is *not* the answer.",
