All #BCH smart contracts going forward will be much more space-efficient, allowing #BitcoinCash to scale better. In the case of AnyHedge, it cut the size of the smart contract by almost 50%.\n\n3. It enables the next steps of improvement to #BCH #BitcoinCash smart contracts that I think will make #UTXO smart contracts as powerful as EVM, but with better scalability.\r\n\n4. Most users won't notice a change immediately. Much work went into making these significant upgrades without breaking anything. Wallets etc. continue to work with no worries. It also means that #BCH #BitcoinCash is upgrading smoothly over time, getting ahead of the crypto pack.",
