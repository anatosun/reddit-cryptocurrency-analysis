First time was fruitful and is now ~~60%~~ ~~55%~~ 50% of my net worth so that was a good fucking day. \n\nEvery few years I seem to get it in my head that \"Surely I may have missed something\" and I go back, sweep Firefox accounts, wallet.dat, all that jazz, but alas there are no more gifts from past me. \n\nAny other old timers feel this?",

Every time the price goes up I search every possible hiding place. The most recent 60k+ spike I found a paper wallet I made. Apparently I drained it in 2014. Obviously not a memorable about but I swear there\u2019s another one hiding somewhere. Maybe behind a photo in a frame\u2026? \u2026maybe. I\u2019ll find it.",
