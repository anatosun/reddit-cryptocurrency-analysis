I've seen so many stocks squeeze I don't know what to think, while a lot of companies that are supposed to be dead, come alive, or companies like evergrand that for some reason never really died, even though it's dead in theory. In practice, Evergrand, the company that every time I read about it, seem to have lost another billion or two, just never seem to die. Someone doing an accurate shorting on that company (which I never thought to do, stupid me.) would probably think it should be fully declared bankrupt and not be purchaseable anymore, which it is in IBKR I think at least.\n\nInflation is sort of the same beast, it's an exponential effect through time, with a slow start. I've been invested in crypto for a long time, on and off although, but I had to sell most of my assets last year, because I had no money to buy food or pay rent, even though I bought the cordano a year before as a hedge against inflation. My belief is still this; we are paid shit, most of us, everything increased in costs, but most of us have gotten less hours (I left my job in hopes of a more stable one, although I didn't get any new job, and now I'm living on my savings.)\n\nThe people so far that benefitted from higher prices, they invested in stocks, especially when it has been a bull market and they feel safer with stocks than tokens, we will see a stable rise in crypto when more and more newspapers report on \"higher than before reported inflation\" and people begin to feel that these currencies actually work. So far, bitcoin is too clunky, etheruem too expensive, and cardano is not developed enough to offer anything as of right now. \n\nRemember; crypto is the LAST place people will put their savings in, when everything else fails, so first, everything else sort of needs to fail. That takes some time, like they say, \"Rome wasn't built on one day.\"\n\nIf you believe in crypto, think instead that NOW is the time to invest, it's almost a godgiven time, if an asset is cheaper now than when you first bought it, revise and see if the fundamentals actually changed, or if you just got granted another investing opportunity. For example, my cordano halved in value after I sold them, which made me a bit more happy now, because when I get my check soon, I can buy way more for way less. I still believe in Cordano, even though the market believes otherwise.",

A sidechain is basically another instance of the chain with small changes in the parameters, like for example polygon has sacrificed decentralization to be able to process more transactions and it is using PoS instead of PoW.\n\nLayer 2 solutions on Ethereum as shown on L2beat.com are basically compression mechanisms for Ethereum which allows for much higher throughput. We are currently seeing massive innovation in both layer 2 solutions becoming better at compression and Ethereum as the layer 1 becoming better at supporting layer 2 solutions, this will lead to exponential scaling since if you get 2x improvement from the layer 2 and then also get a 2x improvement from Ethereum you total 4x improvement instead of just 2x if you didn't have the layer 2. Luckily we aren't just seeing 2x improvements but 10-100x on both layer 1 Ethereum layer 2s over the next couple of years. This is progressive prosess and currently scaling is outpacing demand.\n\nL2fees.info let's you see the tx cost on the different layer 2 solutions",

And that's not including wasted formatting space, so probably 24 drives a year.\n\nNo, this is not realistic or scalable for \"users\" outside of IT home labs and data centers... sounds like centralization... hmm",

This means that they have to spend, just to play keep up. Polygon is now the inferior Layer 2, in fact they had to spend over a Billion just to get their Tech caught up (Mir & Hermez acquisitions), and MATIC gas fees are still more expensive than LoopRing (LRC).\n\nWhen a company has an Endless Marketing Budget, it also screams over valued. They are having to Pay money, to Pump their value. If they stop Pumping their value, people lose interest and will divest into other projects with more potential. \n\nUnfortunately this reminds me a lot of the ADA run up that went down this year. BILLIONS were pumped into ADA for marketing and partnerships to hit the $3 ATH. Then what happened? Massive Rug Pull. As soon as the DAPP capability was launched, and there was no new catalyst to market, Investors mostly sold off. I\u2019m worried the same fate might happen with MATIC.",

I just wish it was easier to transfer between my bank. Pretty decent list of coins and you can lock them away to collect earn and prevent panic selling.\n\nThe crypto earn doesn\u2019t compound, interest goes into your trading account and is too small an amount to stake on its own, so it sits idle until it\u2019s time to restake.\n\nI\u2019ve also used Coinbase, Gemini, and BlockFi (which is for holding not trading).\n\nCoinbase and Gemini both eat away at profits with fees. \n\nCoinbase Pro should solve that issue, but I haven\u2019t used it yet. It cuts fees dramatically and works more like a stock exchange with the ability to set orders for specific prices. \n\n(EDIT: u/BeneficialFly5857 pointed out that Gemini Active Trader doesn\u2019t have those fees, but it is browser based.)\n\nIf I were to try day trading crypto that\u2019s *probably* where I\u2019d do it? That or just use a stock broker. They mostly work in IOUs but if you\u2019re day trading that seems fine.\n\nGemini is the Winkelvoss exchange so if name recognition is a thing there\u2019s that. They can take a while pulling your crypto from Earn to your Trading account -  sometimes days - but it\u2019s not totally locked like Crypto.com. Earn pays out and compounds daily.\n\nBlockFi is great for a crypto savings account. I have some in stablecoins collecting 8-10%. You aren\u2019t locked at all, but they pay out monthly.\n\nI\u2019ve tried and been unable to verify myself on Celsius and Binance, although the latter eventually worked but by then I saw no reason to actually use it. \n\nThe Celsius app doesn\u2019t have a button to take the photo of my license for some reason and I am so confused. There\u2019s one on the \u201cnational ID\u201d page\u2026 probably me doing something wrong with an ad blocker or VPN?\n\nI have also used the Crypto.com and Coinbase debit cards. The red crypto card gets you \u201cfree\u201d Spotify and the $400 worth of CRO I had to stake went up nicely to $700 but that\u2019s obviously not guaranteed. \n\nIt\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d because they reimburse you an equivalent amount of CRO, and then you have to top up your debit card.\n\nCoinbase makes it real easy to just buy USDC funded straight from your bank and you don\u2019t have to top up the card. I bought tacos the other day with it and it was pretty neat.\n\nBlockFi has a Visa credit card that gives Bitcoin with use and increases the interest return on your coins.. I haven\u2019t tried it.",

That means there is no chance I can send money home besides via Western Union which have around 10% tax. I cannot also deposit cash to my bank account even if I present my ID and bank account number. My only chance is by Revolut but I still need someone to pay me in revolut, then I can send some money to my account. If it's a working day the money probably will be there by the end of the day, if it's not they will arrive in the first working day. The whole banking system is too slow and out dated to put it in a light words. I hope that someday there will be widespread crypto terminals where I can convert fiat to crypto, but who knows when this will be available...",

Much easier this way than to produce anything of actual value.\nEventually, the coins with actual use cases will get more and more adopted and the useless coins will fall into obscurity, the volatility will settle down, and the get rich quick crowd will look elsewhere. It will take some time though. But that's why big players like BTC call every coin a $h1tcoin because if more new people don't put their money into BTC, the hodlers won't get the big pay day they're looking for. The entire space is just the greater fool theory personified.\nSure you can get rich betting on some random coin and hope you get lucky, but I personally stick to projects with actual real world value and daily use case other than trading and speculation. Hopefully this nonsense will all be a thing of the past in 5 years.\n\nGood post, op.\nu/chaintip",

Me driving my car, in fact the entire total of all the cars driving around in the world, is a drop in the bucket compared to the CO2 and waste produced by the MANUFACTURING of cars, and manufacturing plants in general. So me running one computer with a couple of GPUs is like nothing, it uses barely any more power than just running a normal computer all day.\n\nAre you a monster for enabling the industry by participating in it with trading? How is that any different from buying a car, or eating meat, or buying/using any product that was built in a factory? This doesn't make any of these things okay, but where do we draw the line? \n\nCrypto only seems to stand out because it doesn't generate anything of intrinsic physical value, but in my mind neither does the minting of physical money, which like crypto has value for its function in mediating a global trade system.\n\nThe problem here is that we've arrived at a \"well you're just as bad!\" argument which doesn't accomplish anything, and if you are invested in the future of crypto you actually SHOULD be critical of its environmental impact in order to force innovation. The system we have is far from perfect but that doesn't mean we should destroy it entirely, the core idea of crypto currency is a very good one it just needs (a lot of) work on the execution.",

It was always a bit of a dull roar in the background, but now it seems like \"cryptocurrency\" has become synonymous with \"scam\" in the popular view. There's thread after thread of people raging about companies trying to make use of blockchains in various ways, and whenever I try to simply inject a little technical information (not even promoting anything in specific, just explaining \"this is how such-and-such works\") I get downvoted and excoriated as a scammer or a \"cryptobro.\"\n\nPeople enjoy righteous indignation. They love being part of a mob that's persecuting a deserving target. There's camaraderie, they're fighting the good fight, they're *heroes*. So if you try to point out \"hey, maybe you're wrong about some particular detail of what's justifying your rage\" you become the enemy. You're threatening to harshen their buzz.\n\nI mainly reassure myself by observing that this is a common, repeating pattern in human nature. Eventually the endorphins from repeated NFT-bashing will become stale. Eventually Ethereum will switch fully to PoS and the environmental boogeyman will lose his hold (sorry, Bitcoin). It's going to cost a lot of opportunities along the way, but if a blockchain application is truly advantageous then eventually someone will take advantage of it.

Much easier this way than to produce anything of actual value.\nEventually, the coins with actual use cases will get more and more adopted and the useless coins will fall into obscurity, the volatility will settle down, and the get rich quick crowd will look elsewhere. It will take some time though. But that's why big players like BTC call every coin a $h1tcoin because if more new people don't put their money into BTC, the hodlers won't get the big pay day they're looking for. The entire space is just the greater fool theory personified.\nSure you can get rich betting on some random coin and hope you get lucky, but I personally stick to projects with actual real world value and daily use case other than trading and speculation. Hopefully this nonsense will all be a thing of the past in 5 years.\n\nGood post, op.\nu/chaintip",

The reason it causes \u201cproblems\u201d is because when the FED interest rate goes up, the rate for like everything in the US goes up as well, including cars, houses, along other things. Long story short, people have less disposable money to spend. They blame the interest rates for a faltering economy, but in reality, it\u2019s all those damn Covid restrictions and the fact that they are printing money for these \u201cstimulus\u201d packages to the tune of over $540 million every single day and that rate keeps going up.",
